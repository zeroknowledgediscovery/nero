%% \textbf{Data acquisition.}  Human‐authored texts were retrieved automatically from two public sources: 1)  Project Gutenberg REST API (\url{https://gutendex.com/}) to download  English‐language books across fiction, poetry, drama, and expository genres.  ii)  technical manuscripts were collected from arXiv via the official OAI-PMH interface, filtered for completeness and converted from \texttt{.tex} source to plain text.  Finally, AI generated texts  were produced through webform and API calls to the specific LLMs (Table~\ref{tab1}).  Prompt wordings, API access details, formal definitions, proofs, and algorithmic details underlying the entropy-rate estimator are provided in the Supplementary Methods.

%% \textbf{Code availability.}  A  reproducible implementation of the entropy-rate estimator, data-harvesting scripts, and end-to-end evaluation pipeline is released under an MIT licence at \url{https://github.com/your-repo/NERO}, together with step-by-step usage instructions and example notebooks.
