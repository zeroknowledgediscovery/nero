     "novel_text": "In the damp, narrow streets of Edinburgh, the air was laced with a kind of foreboding that seemed palpable, a sinister shadow underscoring the city's historic charm. Jes moved through the grey mist with a resolute calmness, her footsteps echoing the silent chant of vengeance that played endlessly in her mind. Her niece's face floated to the surface, radiant and innocent as she was taken too soon by cruelty masked as fate. Since that day, the world painted by Jes had no one but her to be judge, jury, and executioner.\n\nOld MacDougal was having a pint at the corner pub when Jes entered, a calm smile just loose enough to melt into a cruel sneer. Her greeting falteringly sweet, she strolled past him with a flick of her tongue\u2014a mockery in pursed lips. The old man blinked in confusion, unsure if he\u2019d been insulted or merely teased. But Jes chuckled, the sound carrying the weight of something darker, a mirrored consequence to a life's injustice rendered in childish jest.\n\nMiles away, in the bustling heart of Glasgow, Lady Tolladay, a university student often preoccupied with exams and essays, was letting her thoughts unfurl like an unraveled spool. She was sketching the outline of her latest project, but her mind drifted to something far more elemental\u2014an awareness rooted deep within her gut. News had reached her of an avenger rising from the depths of loss, leaving laughter as her lethal calling card.\n\nLate at night, under weak and flickering streetlights, Jes dealt her own kind of justice. Revenge pumped through her veins, a purer light guiding her than she had ever known. Every mark she left was a step toward her niece, a way to make sure that her memory bore not only the petrifying silence of loss but a thunderous echo of reverberation. Old people, the core of generations, found themselves at the mercy of her spirited vengeance. She would come to them with malicious joy, raspberries blown as a signature, a prelude to vanished breaths.\n\nHowever, for Lady Tolladay, this rasp of the tongue was more than a childish prank; it was a puzzle, and she thrived on puzzles. Her estrangement from her own family birthed in her a tester\u2019s fortitude\u2014a longing to mend and explain, and, in her wildest dreams, bring about justice. Jes stood as an antithesis, a chaos she knew she had to confront if only to reclaim something of what she'd lost.\n\nIn the layers of the city's rumble, hidden among the alley whispers and pub musings, Jes knew her time was ticking. This place, while a sanctuary, held perimeter boundaries she knew she\u2019d eventually cross. She continued on her self-delegated mission, aware that with each act of rebellion-laden laughter, she drew another invisible line toward the opposing force, evident in the form of some invisible conscience.\n\nLady Tolladay's steps took her to the aftermath of Jes's latest congregation, her presence a soothing balm to the unrest. Scavenging for hints like her academic mentors had trained her, Tolladay unearthed evidence overlooked by others. It was in the nuance of Jes's influence that she saw the crucial dots connected\u2014not in the haste of abrupt abandonment but in the enduring shadows cast by every act. She started charting the mental map leading directly to Jes\u2019s desecrated heart, convinced she would find the peace she sought only upon quelling Jes\u2019s wrathful vendetta.\n\nTemperatures dropped and roads turned slipperier, Edinburgh's chestnut branches reached into clouded skies, and the cobbled ground grew slick with deceit. Jes felt her knees begin to tremble, a vibration spelled wordlessly in the echo of each step. Her heart carried both grief and resolve, each burgeoning and feasting on past nightmares and memories alike. Her hand gently brushed a carved doorway where etched initials contained stories untold. There, she stood still, aware her signature might lead Lady Tolladay and others burning with justice hunger.\n\nBehind, in solitary moments stretched longer by conflicting hopes, Tolladay faced her own wrest frights. Her allure toward resolution in this initiative gained purpose beyond what mere kinship could provide. Each day crept and each night slipped through her tactile fingers, pressing upon her this collision of destiny. She would find Jes and bring her to account, a guiding light in her pursuit fueled by familial echoes.\n\nAs whispers carried Jes's name among the downtrodden and silenced, Lady Tolladay became engrossed. Maps lain bare, she assessed angles unseen, eager for the twist of fate to comfort her burdens of failure. The landscapes of Scotland became her riddleboard, neglected by all but those with the eyes to see. Each pathway trod came closer to unraveling Jes\u2019s intent, spiraling into a volatile chase between past injuries and their physical manifestations.\n\nJes continued, protagonist in her midnight saga, her laughter an eerie lullaby persisting even as her mind warned her of entrapment. The raspberries become a crushing echo, haunting her daydreams, whispering to her and teasing through her turmoil. Despite the double-edged anguish, she pressed forward, knowing that hesitation was a luxury her vendetta could not afford.",
