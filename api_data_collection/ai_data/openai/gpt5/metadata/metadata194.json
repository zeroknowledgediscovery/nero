     "novel_text": "The first time the air bent around me, we were three minutes from going live, and the evening anchor asked if I kept a diary for my characters.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, because it felt like the right thing to say, and because the little green light on the camera lens looked like a pupil and I wanted to be believed by something that could never blink.\n\nCarlotta\u2014our makeup artist, fingers steady as the plumb line of a high-rise\u2014paused mid-swab. \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ve never kept a diary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d I whispered back, though my voice seemed to drop into the space beneath the chair. The floor chilled. Frost scrolled outward from the feet of the stool like fast-growing lichen. Carlotta yanked her hand back with a tiny tut, and the anchor\u2019s earpiece crackled. The teleprompter hiccuped two lines, repeated a sentence, then rolled on, as if it hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d asked the anchor. He had a professional concern, the kind that wore makeup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I said, brightly. \u201cI keep diaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d he said, smiling, the camera winked, and the whole room decided to believe me for exactly four seconds.\n\nAfter, in the corridor where you can smell the way the building was designed to smell\u2014fresh coffee, citrus, nothing too human\u2014my agent caught up with me. His name was Dax, which he wore like a tie he hadn\u2019t chosen.\n\n\u201cThey want you back next month for the awards round-up,\u201d he said, hands skittering in the pocket of his suit. \u201cYou were charming. You were a little\u2026\u201d He wobbled his head left-right. \u201cIs it the pills?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on pills,\u201d I said. \u201cShould I be?\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head to look at me. People tilt their heads when something doesn\u2019t slot into their expected groove. \u201cYou felt cold,\u201d he said, and rubbed his forearms as if my proximity had stained him. Then he was smiling again. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the air-con. The anchor\u2019s anemic. You know how it is.\u201d\n\nThe anchor wasn\u2019t anemic. The anchor ran marathons and had a podcast about sunrises. People who run in dawn light are the opposite of anemia. But I nodded, because the easiest way to move in this industry is to nod and tell the room it\u2019s right until you can get to the door and remember your actual name.\n\nOutside the studio we were in the part of the city that used to be warehouses and now was restaurants with ferns. Drones treated us like siblings, trailing in weird sibling formations. They had good manners. They always stayed out of the way. People didn\u2019t. A pair of tourists angled in for a selfie and my body arranged itself to fit the frame. Auto-smile. They asked if I was the real me, the way you ask a window if it\u2019s rain or just someone else\u2019s breath.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m real,\u201d I said. My breath did not fog the air.\n\nDax\u2019s phone was on vibrate but it throbbed like a living thing in his pocket, a heart that wanted its own show. \u201cThey\u2019ve moved the table read up. Can you be at Stage E by three?\u201d He glanced at me sideways. \u201cDon\u2019t flake, Mira.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t flake,\u201d I said. He was already moving. So was I, because movement makes a person look like they have a plan. It\u2019s a trick I learned when I was still stepping out on taped marks and believing the love story at the end of page forty-eight.\n\nStage E was a big hangar with a roof like a mouth. The script pages were new enough to still have the smell of toner, bitter and a little sweet. I was supposed to be a detective who fell in love with a bomb disposal expert, which was fun because when we shot the trailer last month, our bomb disposal expert had tripped over a cable and laughed for eight minutes like a kettle that had seen God, and now his knees were carefully bandaged, pallid little pretzels.\n\n\u201cHey, Mira,\u201d called Jonah, who played the rival detective with the troubled childhood. Jonah waved a page at me. He had terrible posture and a face made for close-ups. You never would have cast him as anything other than a man who waited behind a door and said something devastating.\n\nHe said something devastating when we broke for coffee. \u201cYou should hire a sidekick,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want them to take you seriously as a detective.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cA sidekick,\u201d I said. \u201cLike, to get my lines? Is that an insult?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that kind,\u201d he said, and leaned in, as if the air could be trusted not to pick our words up and carry them away. \u201cA Guardian. The Aegis program. They\u2019re rolling it out wider. If you had a Guardian, they\u2019d have to let you into the meetings. You could see the files.\u201d\n\nI thought he was doing a bit. We did bits. It made the hours pass like a better kind of weather. \u201cInto what meetings?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb,\u201d he said, not unkindly. \u201cThe Choir keeps shutting you out. Or shutting Dax out. Or just humming at the door until your calendar forgets you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Choir,\u201d I said. It was a joke. It had started as a joke. But like most jokes about how power worked, it had the unfashionable habit of being accurate.\n\nWhen the world hit the kind of turbulence that rattles teeth, the women moved into government by means that looked like luck and were not. They inherited, they were appointed to fill gaps, they volunteered for committees no one else wanted, they smiled at the end of everything they said so the room could imagine itself generous. They networked sideways, diagonals across departments, up through the climate vertical and the ethics sprig. Screenshots passed hand to hand in bathrooms. A policy advisor named Anahi traced the first map on the back of a check for a latte no one ever cashed. People called them infiltrators because the old language for entering a place was always war.\n\nThey called themselves the Choir when they had to call themselves something. If you ask them, they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s not a conspiracy; it\u2019s an alignment. They hit pitch together. They knew which walls could take harmony. They made legislation that held changes in place like a good bridge holds a river\u2014in motion and in shape. Also: they kept a few doors shut, and if you had the wrong face at the wrong time, you were told to wait in the lounge and be patient. I have a face people like to point lights at, which is sometimes the wrong face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not feasible,\u201d I told Jonah. \u201cYou don\u2019t just go to a store and buy a Guardian.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jonah said cheerfully. \u201cYou get assigned one. If you\u2019re a world leader.\u201d\n\nI was an actor. I was good at it, even on bad days, even when the camera felt like a mouth. I was not a world leader. But Jonah was watching me with that expression he wore when he knew more than he wanted to. \u201cYou want a Guardian,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBecause you\u2019re trying to figure out who\u2019s been robbing you.\u201d\n\nThe thefts had been small at first, like mice. Ten minutes gone from a morning. Fifteen from a dinner. A meeting where everyone acted like they\u2019d already had the conversation without me. Then a week last autumn where I woke with the sure, packed feeling that I had once stood in a bright place and said a terrible sentence. Then: evidence. A streaming platform that glitched my face into a different actress\u2019s smile. A lawyer\u2019s email with my name misspelled in a way it had never been misspelled before. \u201cYou think that\u2019s a crime,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI think all interesting theft is crime,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all boring theft is budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would a Guardian help?\u201d I still couldn\u2019t keep the laughter out of my voice. I wanted to, but laughter is like breath: it sneaks. \u201cThey\u2019re for presidents. Not for fakes. Not for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresidents are fakes,\u201d said Jonah quietly, and then he smiled, and the smile had angles I knew because I\u2019d seen them on-screen, but it wasn\u2019t the same. \u201cThe Aegis program pairs heads of state with people who can hit things and also know how to smell trouble behind glass. They\u2019re licensed. They can do things no one else can. Warrantless intuition. There\u2019s a treaty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a treaty,\u201d I repeated. \u201cDid you make this up in the line for coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook it up,\u201d he said, and slid me a folded paper. An actual paper, not a link, not a QR. The title across the top: Directory of Recognized Sovereigns, updated in pale ink, the last page of an info packet only someone inside the room would have. At the bottom, a note\u2014handwritten\u2014Eligible for Aegis Pairing: confirmed. Eligibility restricted to heads of state or de facto world leaders with Directory recognition. The swoop of the pen felt familiar, like I should know the hand and didn\u2019t. \u201cYou do a thing with your mouth when you\u2019re angry,\u201d Jonah said conversationally. \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can talk,\u201d I said. Then we were called back and the bombs were fake again and so were we.\n\nAt lunch I went to the restroom because you can always go to the restroom. The mirror above the sinks admired me. That was its job. It did its job. It showed my hair in the color my fans fought over on message boards. It showed the little scar at the corner of my eye that we didn\u2019t erase in post because it made me accessible. It showed my mouth not doing anything unfortunate with anger.\n\nThere were no droplets on the mirror\u2019s surface. It was dry as paper. The girl at the end of the row\u2014new background, cheeks still with teenage softness\u2014was practicing her smile. Her reflection showed her. Mine showed me.\n\nI put my hand out toward the glass and didn\u2019t meet it. My palm felt a pressure that wasn\u2019t exactly pressure. It was like pushing into high wind, except the air around us was still and lemon-scented.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d the girl asked. She was watching me and not watching me at the same time, which is a skill. \u201cYou look like you saw, like, something.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rehearsing,\u201d I said, because that is the laminate I lay over anything the world might not understand. \u201cGreat tip,\u201d I added. \u201cPractice your smile in your car with the seatbelt on. If you have to smile under compression, it\u2019s muscle memory.\u201d It was good advice. I wished it were mine.\n\nShe lit with gratitude. It was like turning on a lamp in wrongdoing. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.\n\nI pressed harder against the mirror. It should have gone cool under my skin. It didn\u2019t. It felt like writing with chalk on glass, like the air between us was full of powdered bone.\n\nWhen the day wrapped the shadows off Stage E and packed them away in someone\u2019s trunk, I walked the long outside\u2019s edges, past posters for movies that had never been made and posters for movies I had made and never watched. People watched. They watched on phones and in baths and on trains where the lights went out and everyone pretended not to be afraid. It\u2019s an intimacy. We pretend it\u2019s not.\n\nA woman sat on the edge of the backlot fountain. Her face was an arrangement you could find in any decade. She wore an overcoat that would have been dramatic if not for the fact it was the same color as the sky. Gray was a glove the day put over itself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said, even though we had not agreed to meet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m famous,\u201d I said. \u201cI tried to be on time and five different people wanted a picture with my elbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your picture,\u201d she said. \u201cI want your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cMira Leland,\u201d I said, because that was what it said on my contracts. I still used my birth name with my sister and my tax returns. You hold on to the names that know your ribs.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask what your contracts say,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should try listening the first time. It saves all sorts of heartache later.\u201d Her smile wasn\u2019t unkind. It was precise. \u201cCall me Alma.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I know you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know my Choir,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cEveryone pretends they don\u2019t know my Choir. It\u2019s the only way we get any work done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re with the government,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be vulgar,\u201d she said, and then she laughed. I wanted that laugh to be unmusical. It wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe are the government, if you mean by that the scaffolding around it. Sometimes you let the walls put their own scaffolding up. They choose pretty or ugly and either way we hold. Sometimes, Mira, we hold a door shut.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I being shut out?\u201d I asked. \u201cFrom what?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom being prey,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are keeping you. Not safe, exactly. Seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one asked me,\u201d I said. The mirror in the bathroom had also not asked me. The air was full of things that didn\u2019t ask and did anyway.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ask children if they want their hands held crossing a road,\u201d said Alma. \u201cYou\u2019re not a child. You\u2019re an asset.\u201d\n\nThere it was. The blunt thing. It\u2019s a relief when someone lets go of nuance. It\u2019s like taking heels off.\n\n\u201cGet to your point,\u201d I said. \u201cIf there is one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a Guardian,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get a Guardian without being recognized by the Directory. You can\u2019t be recognized by the Directory unless you are a head of state.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich you can be,\u201d she said. Her eyes were a color you couldn\u2019t trust. It was the color of a sky that might mean rain. \u201cRules change. We change them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d make me a president so I can get a bodyguard,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a sign at the entrance to a theme park in hell. Why. And why me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good actress,\u201d Alma said. \u201cPeople think you are what you say you are. That\u2019s useful in a leader. You care about harm. You can smell it. That\u2019s useful in a leader. You are missing time.\u201d She held up a hand when my mouth opened. \u201cWe know. We measure the holes. That\u2019s useful in a leader, too. Leaders are at their best when they are searching for something they have lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make me a leader,\u201d I said, \u201cso you can assign me a Guardian and then you can listen in on everything I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cWe\u2019re the government. We\u2019re always listening. Also, we need you to do something that cannot be done in any other way and not be\u2014how do you say\u2014untidy about it. You will want to do it. It will work out. Mostly.\u201d\n\nThe fountain was switched off in winter. I stared at a stone horse with water stains like old crying. \u201cWhat thing,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cFind out who killed you,\u201d said Alma.\n\nYou know the way a sentence can slice you into the person you were before you heard it and the person you are after. The first person is a ghost to the second. A joke, since I laughed then. I laughed because it was a ridiculous line and because laughter is the fail-safe. \u201cI\u2019m not dead,\u201d I said. \u201cI was just on television. You were probably watching and shouting at me.\u201d\n\nAlma\u2019s head tilted. The wind must have moved. I felt my hair adjust. It had weight, which seemed important. \u201cTelevision is haunted,\u201d she said. \u201cIt always has been. I didn\u2019t shout at your appearance. I was busy. But it was a good performance. The part where you lied and Carlotta\u2019s fingers went cold. You\u2019re learning control.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf what, exactly,\u201d I said, and tasted the of like a coin.\n\n\u201cOf walls,\u201d she said. \u201cOf glass. Of exits. Of people\u2019s heat. You died six months ago, Mira. During the stunt with the car flip on the 101 set. We shut it down before it reached the news. Do you want the file name? We can be vulgar.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sister would notice,\u201d I said. \u201cEveryone would notice. Wouldn\u2019t they.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone noticed,\u201d said Alma. \u201cThen we made them unnotice. You\u2019re useful. Not just because you can smile into the mouth of the world. Ask Jonah. He thinks he\u2019s the only one who knows. He thinks he\u2019s doing you a mercy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw him today,\u201d I said, and the act of admitting seeing shifted something behind my sternum. It was not pain. It was the shape of an absence.\n\nAlma tucked something into my jacket pocket. It was heavy. \u201cYou are not a solid,\u201d she said, and the way she said it made it sound like philosophy, not insult. \u201cYou are a velocity. That\u2019s why we want you. That\u2019s why they want you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are they,\u201d I said.\n\nShe smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out faster with a Guardian. Take the Directory. Think of a country. You don\u2019t need land. Land is for people who think everything is a one-to-one map. You need jurisdiction. You need ceremony. You\u2019ll be the head of the State of Something. Pick something.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe State of Something,\u201d I said. \u201cIt sounds like a teenager\u2019s band.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll think of a better name,\u201d she said, standing. She was taller than I had thought. She did not step back like a person afraid of bumping me. She walked through the micro-weather around me as if it were a curtain she\u2019d borrowed. \u201cYou have two days. We already widened the definition. Be quick, Mira. Some doors close loudly.\u201d\n\nAfter she left, I put my hand in my pocket. The metal against my palm was cold in a way that felt honest. It was a sovereign seal machine, the handheld kind you\u2019d use to press a seal into wax if your diplomacy required wax. It was stamped with a field of small stars and one larger one split in half. The handle was smooth from someone else\u2019s hand. It had belonged to Anahi, if the letters scratched into the underside meant anything. I squeezed until my fingers remembered how to ache.\n\nThe trick with being told you\u2019re dead is that nothing, exactly, changes in the second after. The cars still pass. The lamppost flickers and then remembers itself. A woman in the distance fights her groceries. Face recognition in billboards blinks and recalibrates and misreads and gets me and then doesn\u2019t.\n\nHere\u2019s the worst part. A small part of me already knew. That part had been putting out bowls of water for a dog that had not come home. That part had been staring at my reflection and counting more than the mirror would ever count back.\n\nI went home because going home is the only thing you can do when you cannot think of a better thing. My apartment was the kind that gets photographed when magazines want to do a feature on how mortality can be softened with textiles. There were plants. There was a view. There was a painting my sister had made when we were eleven because we had a teacher who thought everyone should paint the sky and my sister had decided the sky was a bruise. It was titled: Girl With Two Names. She\u2019d given it to me to keep me honest.\n\nThe security system purred hello. The lights warmed as if the house were putting its palms out toward me. I set the sovereign seal on the counter, next to the bowl where I left keys even though keys seemed increasingly symbolic. The bowl had a chip in the rim. I liked the chip because it felt like a secret handshake with damage. None of the plants had died, because the system watered them and because plants are often better at living without us than we are without them.\n\nI called my sister. Her name is Luca, and she peels apples with the same kind of concentration she used to peel wallpaper. She picked up on the third ring. \u201cTell me you\u2019ve escaped your handlers,\u201d she said. \u201cTell me you\u2019re out somewhere you\u2019ll regret.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met a woman,\u201d I said. \u201cShe says I\u2019m dead.\u201d\n\nSilence is a sound. You don\u2019t notice it until you are listening to it. \u201cIs this a bit,\u201d Luca said finally. She was stirring something. I could hear the soft rebellion of boiling water.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think or you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d The word scraped. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re dead,\u201d she said, \u201cwho am I talking to.\u201d\n\nYou can love someone and still be ruthless with them, because love and ruthlessness are cousins. \u201cMaybe the someone you were always talking to,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve been\u2026 adjacent for a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me,\u201d she said plainly. \u201cI\u2019m going to come over.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, because I didn\u2019t know what would happen when she walked through my air. \u201cLater. Please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said please,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t say please unless you\u2019ve already done the thing you need permission for.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you remember the car flip,\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about work when we talk,\u201d she said, small reflex. Then she laughed, a small, surprised laugh. \u201cExcept we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe day of the flip,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember making bread because the radio said words like \u2018tie-in\u2019 and \u2018staggered release window\u2019 and I needed to pound something. I remember your forehead feeling like the back of a fridge when you came over to eat the bread and lie on my couch and watch those stupid videos of dogs who have been reunited with soldiers. I remember thinking: she\u2019s not here. I remember thinking: strange, how light doesn\u2019t warm.\u201d She inhaled. \u201cI\u2019m coming over.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask me if I was okay. She didn\u2019t ask me if I wanted soup. She hung up, and the house and I listened to the soundlessness before the doorbell rings.\n\nI put the kettle on because there are things you do even when you are not a solid. You make tea. You lay out the good cups. You move in the patterns of a person and hope the pattern convinces the surface tension.\n\nThe doorbell rang and the intercom screen blinked. There was her face, my face if it had grown up into a different kind of certainty. I pressed the button and said, \u201cCome up.\u201d The lock released. Her footsteps in the hall were her footsteps in the hall were her bare feet on the suburban stairs of our childhood house. Memory is stupid like that. It layers.\n\nShe came in and stopped dead in the doorway. Because she could feel it. People can feel the difference in the air the way they can feel pressure change before rain. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, and then she was crying and then she was laughing because we are the kind of family that laughs to keep the cry from blowing the roof off. She took two steps and then another and then stopped again because her arms had reached that place where they wanted to close around me and didn\u2019t know what would come back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I said. It is a short sentence. It can be a lie. I made it as true as I could.\n\nShe lowered her arms. She did not touch me. She retired engagement like a flag. She went to the counter and touched the sovereign seal instead. \u201cWhat\u2019s this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might become a country,\u201d I said.\n\nShe wiped her cheeks with the heel of her hand. \u201cOf course you will,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t decided,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to be recognized so I can get a Guardian so I can find out who stole me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing,\u201d she said, and it was not a question.\n\n\u201cThe thing,\u201d I said.\n\nShe made the tea. She fetched the good cups I had already set out. She talked about who had called her today, about the neighbor who had left jasmine on the windowsill, about the smallnesses that keep you upright. She slipped the important questions between like cards. \u201cIf this is true\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIf,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you died. Why would they bring you back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was never away,\u201d I said. Or: \u201cMaybe away isn\u2019t the right idea. Maybe I fell forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always did,\u201d she said. She lifted her cup, held it under her face, inhaled the steam. The steam rose around her and didn\u2019t so much as brush me. \u201cWhat do you call a country with no land.\u201d\n\n\u201cA state of mind,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cA state of the art,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cA state of emergency,\u201d I said.\n\nShe snapped her fingers. She has always been better at names than me. \u201cInterim,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Interim. The sovereign state of the time between.\u201d She smiled, and the smile had the exact measure of wicked you can only have when you love someone too much to leave the joke alone. \u201cIt\u2019s accurate.\u201d\n\nI tried it on in my mouth. \u201cI am the Custodian of the Interim,\u201d I said. It tasted like tin. \u201cIt sounds like a janitor at a metaphysical museum.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always wanted to work in museum,\u201d she said. She rifled the Directory paperwork, a little pale with the kind of pale you get when you fight a timeline and lose. Small print, signatures, clauses that described a person you might not recognize. \u201cWe can do this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks like we can. Do you need a flag.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone needs a flag,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can use the painting.\u201d\n\nShe looked over her shoulder at the Girl With Two Names, all bruise and horizon. \u201cToo heavy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need something that looks good in wind.\u201d\n\nWe were still laughing when the lights dimmed, and it wasn\u2019t the house dimming them, and the laughter died because the dimness had nothing to do with the roof. The dimness was inside the room like another person. The temperature dropped, I suppose. I don\u2019t know. The word temperature originates inside a body. I could only measure change by the way Luca\u2019s breath thickened.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching you,\u201d said an entirely reasonable voice. It came from the corridor where the light refused to go. \u201cI\u2019d like to help.\u201d\n\nThe old me would have screamed. The actress me would have said: who\u2019s there. The new me\u2014the one with a sovereign seal pressed into her palm and the echo of a woman\u2019s words inside her skull like a repeating hallway\u2014said, \u201cStep into the kitchen. It\u2019s better for introductions.\u201d\n\nHe did. He was not what the dimness implied. He was smaller and blunter and realer. He wore second-hand clothes with first-hand care. He had the bearing of someone who had learned to take up exactly as much space as would not earn him attention, which is to say: a survivor. \u201cCall me North,\u201d he said, as if I had asked for directions.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want,\u201d Luca said, standing between him and me without making a show of it.\n\n\u201cTo apply,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a casting,\u201d I said, which was a cruel line in a life like mine.\n\nHe smiled like a door. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a sidekick,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you become head of the Interim. Alarms aren\u2019t going to be enough. Alms aren\u2019t going to be enough. Call it what you want. Guardian, shadow, second. You\u2019ll need someone to carry the flashlight while you carry the flag.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you find me,\u201d I said. Which is the wrong question. The right question is: why do you think you know my shape.\n\n\u201cI know where the holes are,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been living in them a while. And besides, you asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d he said. \u201cYou looked at the mirror and you said please.\u201d\n\nHe was here and he had eyes like maps of the city at dawn. My kettle went off like a temper. I took it off the heat. I kept my hand in the steam. I stayed. \u201cYou know there\u2019s a process,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know the Directory requires paperwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have paperwork,\u201d he said, and put on the counter, beside the sovereign seal, a card. It was plastic the way a wedding ring is gold: it meant it but also it didn\u2019t. At the top, in small letters, Aegis Program, Adjunct Grade. Below that, in the thick font that is supposed to stop people from faking it, NORTH, NO OTHER NAMES. The rest was signed by no one I recognized and everyone who mattered. The date was yesterday. Approval: conditional.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re prepped,\u201d I said. \u201cI haven\u2019t even named my state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought of a few for you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you should pick your own.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow,\u201d Luca said quietly, \u201cdid you get an Adjunct card for a program that doesn\u2019t accept applications unless the head of state requests you by name.\u201d\n\nHe met her eyes with respect. \u201cTurns out I died, too,\u201d he said.\n\nSo we were three, in a kitchen with good cups and no warmth, and the room had the rich taste of danger in it, like cocoa. I picked up the seal. I held it like it might know what it was for. Somewhere, not far and not near, a woman who had named the world after an instrument was moving a piece on a board. I could feel Alma in the grain of the table. I could feel the city in my teeth.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cOkay. The Interim. The state between. You\u2019ll be my\u2014what. My lantern.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour North,\u201d he said gently.\n\n\u201cI have a sister,\u201d I said, helpless.\n\n\u201cShe can be your north, too,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have more than one.\u201d\n\nI stamped the seal on a napkin because the wax hadn\u2019t arrived and because I needed to see whether pressure still made a mark. It did. The paper dented. The symbol printed. The halves of the star stayed separate. \u201cTell me,\u201d I said to North, to Luca, to the Directory, to any gods that were not offended by paperwork. \u201cTell me what happens when I declare a country.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t declare,\u201d said Alma, from the doorway. I didn\u2019t turn because I had expected her and because you lose points when you let the unseen get the jump on you. \u201cYou recognize. You recognize what already exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recognize,\u201d I said. \u201cThe Interim exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we raise your flag,\u201d said Alma. \u201cThen the Choir sings. Then you get your sidekick. Then you go find your murderer. Not necessarily in that order.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t like the order,\u201d I said.\n\nShe smiled. \u201cBuild a new one,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what governments are for.\u201d\n\nAt midnight I went to bed and dreamt of the back lot fountain running. The stone horse dipped its head to drink from its own mouth. In the dream the water ran backward and upward, and my sister painted the sky with different bruises until she found the exact shade of gone.\n\nWhen I woke, the apartment still smelled of tea. The seal was on the counter, tilted like it had listened all night. The Directory lay open to a page that had not been there before. The page read: State of Interim (provisional). Leader: Custodian Mira Leland (no other names). Flag: to be determined. Eligibility: immediate.\n\nI made coffee for the drama of it. Only one thing was wrong. My phone showed a feed of pictures from the night before. There I was in the kitchen, holding nothing. There Luca was, holding a cup. There the doorway. There the absence where a man should have been. There the air that had learned to stand like a person.\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect,\u201d said a voice from under the table.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said to the air, because it was early and I had not yet decided which rules to rewrite. \u201cYou don\u2019t show up on cameras.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither do you,\u201d said North. \u201cNot the way you think.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won a cinematography award indirectly,\u201d I told him. He laughed, and it shook the dust.\n\nWe put two chairs at the table. I sat in one. He sat in the other with his back very straight, like an old photograph of a boy about to go to war. Luca arrived in the morning clothes of a person who had slept in her clothes. Alma did not come because boundaries help. The city chewed and breathed and inhaled the quiet hours between us as if they were oxygen.\n\nI didn\u2019t give a speech. I signed. We sang a few lines from a song we both remembered from a church our mother had pretended to believe in to make the neighbors kind. We made it up as we went along. That\u2019s the only way anyone has ever built anything.\n\nBy lunch, the Choir had logged me. By afternoon, the flag had a shape: a field of blue-gray and a thin white line running through it like horizon. By evening, messages arrived, and they were already old, like light from stars that had decided to reach us. An embassy asked where to send a bouquet. A late night host wrote a monologue. A woman in a state where the water did not boil safe sent me a photo of her daughter wearing a paper crown.\n\nAnd somewhere close, and somewhere far, someone smiled in a way that did not require their face to move. They had killed me once. They had made a hole. They had done a bad thing in a clean room. The Interim was my hand on the glass.\n\nWe had dinner the way people do who are trying to prove they are unkillable. We ate leftovers. We argued about whether a state should collect taxes. We watched a movie I was not in. We fell asleep on the couch, my head near the cushion and not on it, Luca\u2019s hand near my hair and not in it, North\u2019s boots near the door like a promise.\n\nI dreamt of the car, the flip, the way the world can turn over and still pretend to be continuous. I dreamt of the moment in the mirror when the boy practicing his smile realized he had gotten it right. I woke to the sound of someone knocking on the door, softly and insistently, like a neighbor or a future.\n\nOn the threshold, a parcel. No return address. Inside, wax in a tin the color of ruined gold, a flag sewn by a hand I couldn\u2019t name, and a note written in that precise hand I should have recognized the first time.\n\nWelcome to the government, it said. Try not to die again. It\u2019s becoming a habit.The parcel had the weight of a held breath, the kind you take before you go under and pretend that water is just another kind of air. The wax inside the tin smelled faintly of rosemary and coins, a scent with ancestry. The flag was stitched from a fabric with memory; when I lifted it, it tried to turn toward a breeze that wasn\u2019t there, as if it knew where up was better than I did. The note, with its tidy geometries of ink, did not tremble. It did not have to. It knew it could make hands shake on its behalf.\n\nWe did not have a balcony, only a window with a ledge and a civic sense of danger. We made the ledge into a balcony by believing in it together. Luca taped the flag to a pole that had been a broom handle until five minutes ago, and North, who was not on my feed or any feed but whose presence pressed the air into shapes, weighed the base with a bag of rice and a cast-iron pan. We raised the Interim over a city that hadn\u2019t decided yet whether to notice and pretended it was accustomed to being flown over things it did not govern. I expected trumpets and was blessed with the ordinary, which has its own tone: a siren three streets away, a drone trilling pleasantly as it recalibrated around a new object in its sky map, a neighbor\u2019s radio finding a station and then apologizing with static. The fabric lifted a little, then settled, then lifted. If you\u2019ve ever taught a word to a parrot you understand the patience. It takes time for meaning to stick.\n\nCeremony, Alma had said, and she was right, though not for the reasons she prefers. You have to touch things to make them agree to be true. We heated a spoon over the stove and poured the ruined-gold wax into a circle on the heavy paper the Directory had provided, a paper with the faint tooth of archival vows. I pressed the half-star seal into the pool and felt the wax resist with a muscle\u2019s kind of intelligence. It accepted the impression the way flesh accepts a bruise, as a record and as a suggestion to be careful. Luca signed as Witness of Kin with the flourish she reserves for people at the bank, and North, whose name pretended to leave no fingerprints, signed as Adjunct with a hand that looked like it had learned writing sideways, in margins, in light that failed to reach all the way down.\n\nThe form asked me to list the borders of the Interim, and I wrote: anywhere a breath fogs a window and leaves the ghost of a handprint. It asked me to specify my jurisdiction and I wrote: the time between decision and action. It asked me to confirm my anthem, and we wrote three lines from a song our mother loved and then crossed them out and wrote an instruction instead: hum until the room agrees to hush. It asked me if the Interim would levy taxes and we checked a box that did not exist and wrote beside it: debts forgiven upon evidence of sincerity. You can build a country like that and a clerk will roll their eyes and make another box appear and stamp it not-a-threat and we call that the miracle of paper.\n\nWhen Dax called at nine, my phone shook itself like a wet dog. He did not say hello because he doesn\u2019t believe in expenditure without return. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re trending three different ways, two of them delightful.\u201d He said, \u201cPeople love a woman with a flag.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat did you do.\u201d His voice did not rise at the end because he knew the answer in the way a person knows the smell of rain. I put him on speaker because I like my sister to hear the things I\u2019m supposed to pretend not to hear.\n\n\u201cI accepted an offer of nationhood,\u201d I said. I tried to sound like someone who had had a good breakfast. \u201cIt comes with benefits. Healthcare. A seal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for satire,\u201d he said, but he was already tapping and reading because that\u2019s what he does when the world moves. \u201cOkay, I see the press release. Did you send a press release.\u201d His inhale found a snag. \u201cMira. Who sent a press release.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hummed,\u201d I said. \u201cThe room hushed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are going to tell me you\u2019ve been recognized by a panel that acknowledges unaffiliated states of mind,\u201d he said, rapid, the way a magician does patter before the reveal. \u201cYou are going to tell me there\u2019s a treaty that says if you hum in a certain register someone hands you a bodyguard and lets you walk into rooms where people decide where the water goes when it overflows. You are going to get me sued by metaphysics.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the Aegis program,\u201d I said, because names make men feel better. \u201cYou\u2019ve never liked metaphysics unless it stared back. Don\u2019t worry. It will.\u201d\n\nHe went quiet. He is never quiet unless there\u2019s an invoice ticking in him. \u201cYou\u2019re not making sense,\u201d he said finally, softer. \u201cAnd you\u2019re colder than usual. Are you near a vent. Don\u2019t be near a vent when you talk to a journalist. They\u2019ll write about the way you don\u2019t fog glass and they won\u2019t bother to check if the air-conditioning just reads wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cDax,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you remember the car flip.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not for press,\u201d he said reflex, and then the reflex unhooked and fell. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I know the memo. I know we lost a day and gained a lawsuit that never arrived. I know you brought me bread and put your feet on my coffee table and complained that cinnamon had become a conspiracy. I know your skin felt like someone had warm hands on you from a distance. I know they told me not to put you on late-night for six weeks and then they told me to put you on everything for eight months. I am a professional opportunist. I can hold two orders at once. What game have you climbed into now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one with rules that change while you watch,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s called governance.\u201d\n\nHe breathed out, the sound of a man who has recognized a path that does not include him even though he sold the maps. \u201cSay yes when they ask you about the charity tie-in,\u201d he said, brisk again, the way you become when you have decided to swim under the wave instead of fighting it. \u201cSay the Interim is dedicated to interstitial spaces and their inhabitants. Smile like people deserve kindness and like you are the person delivering it. I\u2019ll send you a bullet list. Please, Mira, do not bite a host. Watch the hands that look like they could be clean.\u201d\n\nAfter he hung up, I looked at North, who had been reading the Directory with the intentness of someone who expects the paper to turn into a door at any minute. \u201cWarrantless intuition,\u201d I said. \u201cShow me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ugly phrase,\u201d he said, and he didn\u2019t mean the grammar. He touched the wax we had just sealed and then lifted his finger to his mouth, not to taste but to breathe on, as if the lines in the pad could read. \u201cWe don\u2019t break in. We decide that the lock has made a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you telling me you pick doors by apologizing to them,\u201d Luca said, at the stove, digging the last of the honey with a sternness that would have frightened any bear worth its title. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been married to people like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoors open for apology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey close for excuses.\u201d He went to the counter where the parcel lay open and studied the tin that had held the wax. He held it the way you hold a baby bird you plan to release, careful and unselfconscious. \u201cThere\u2019s a smell in this,\u201d he said finally. \u201cNot the rosemary. Not the coins. Something like stone dust and hot filament. We sniff those, in the holes. We learn the difference between accident and decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were there,\u201d I said, and the words stepped wrong in my mouth, like a foot finding the edge of a stair lower than expected. \u201cThe day of the flip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was within listening distance of the road,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a paper taped to the call sheet no one had printed. It wasn\u2019t on the grid. It had a watermark I couldn\u2019t see until I put it in my pocket and forgot it there for an hour. When I remembered to look, the paper had erased itself and left only a smell. It smelled like this tin.\u201d He set the tin down gently, as if gentleness could undo intent. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch your car. There were enough hands on it already.\u201d\n\nWe went to the place where hands had been. It had been redressed as a different warehouse and a different stretch of highway, because the city does that when it is paid. Security at the gate was a woman with eyebrows painted on with absolute loyalty to a curve she had agreed upon in youth, and a clipboard that wanted to be a sword. Her uniform had a patch that said Saffron in small letters, and when she took my ID she held it like a metaphor she didn\u2019t have time for. When North put down his card, she did not see it, but her hand moved the way hands move when the temperature of their work changes.\n\n\u201cAegis,\u201d she said, without looking at the letters. \u201cRight. You can go in. Don\u2019t bleed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that to all your guests,\u201d Luca said, and Saffron blinked, the first sign of humanity, as if someone had told a joke in a language she hadn\u2019t expected to hear on her shift.\n\nThe warehouse smelled like wood pretending to be steel and steel pretending to be wood. The marks the crew had made months ago were still on the floor in tape and scuffs and a path worn by footsteps. The practice car sat under a tarp with an attitude, the tarp squared off like a soldier\u2019s bed. Brazos, our stunt coordinator, emerged from a stack of mats like a man who has learned to forgive gravity for being so predictable, and his hands looked like they had been braided by rope. He loved his work the way some people love high windows, quietly and with fanatic care.\n\n\u201cI heard you died,\u201d he said, and there was no malice in it, only everybody\u2019s attempt at courtesy. \u201cDidn\u2019t seem to stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt leaves marks,\u201d I said, and he nodded, as if I had pointed out a harness burn he\u2019d watched form.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do the flip,\u201d he said, which would have been a great note months ago. \u201cYou remember the pre-vis. You remember the math. We don\u2019t ask engines to speak French. We talk to them in ratios. Somebody sneaked a subjunctive into my calculus, and I don\u2019t teach verbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho asked for an extra take,\u201d North said, and if he had been a cop it would have been a hard question, but he was not a cop. He was someone asking a table if it would prefer to be a door.\n\nBrazos rubbed the back of his neck the way wrestlers do when they consider a tie. \u201cThe grey guy,\u201d he said. \u201cCompliance. He didn\u2019t have a name. He had a laminate that had been laminated twice, the kind of ID you make when you expect to be arrested and want the arresting officer to second-guess her eyes. He was with a woman in a coat. She didn\u2019t talk. She pointed. He pointed at the pointing. He said we were doing great work and that somebody upstairs wanted a clean take for insurance. He said that nobody loses their house if we give him one more reel. I don\u2019t like to be used to keep a person in a house. I let him have it because I like to help a house keep a person. Do you see the trap. It\u2019s an honest trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was daylight,\u201d I said. \u201cI remember the day not dark yet. He wore the sort of gray that only exists when the sun is still deciding whether color is a suggestion or a rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Brazos said, eyes grateful, because when you match someone\u2019s shade it tells them you belong in the picture.\n\nHe led us to the rig as if it were a person he didn\u2019t want to spook. He knew the places to lay a hand as you might know a lover\u2019s shoulder. The struts had been replaced with struts. The shell had been repainted to be something else entirely. That is how sets apologize for damage: they change clothes. I put my palm on the hood and felt nothing a human would have cataloged as heat, but the air around my hand altered as if it had overheard its name in a different room. Frost sketched itself out from my wrist in a pattern that looked almost like handwriting, and I didn\u2019t pull away because I was learning that pulling away leaves the room with your shape anyway.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Luca said, and there was the older sister in it, the one who used to stand in front of the TV when commercials frightened me and make a puppet out of her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re writing on steel. Don\u2019t sign this without a lawyer.\u201d\n\nNorth had already moved before she spoke. He had a small flashlight, the kind that looks like it should be attached to a keychain but had the attention span of a cathedral. He knelt and peered into the dark of the wheel well, then under the seat where my body had been not-a-solid, then at the floor where the rigging\u2019s shadow had spawned its own system of shadows. He didn\u2019t reach with his fingers at first. He reached with his breath, a steady exhale that fogged surfaces in specific points. It was map-making with lungs.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said finally, voice low not with drama but with respect for whatever he was about to trespass. He slid something thin and reluctant out from the seam between the roll cage and the frame, a piece of plastic no bigger than a fingernail, with a film of adhesive browned by time and engine heat. It was a tag, the kind you use in audits, stamped with a symbol I had only seen lately and in dreams: the half-star, split, the same as on my seal, the same as on the note in my kitchen. In the split, someone had drawn, very carefully with a needle or a thought, a tiny circle like the mouth of a surprised fish.\n\n\u201cI thought the Directory used watermarks,\u201d Luca said. \u201cNot stickers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe use everything,\u201d said a voice I knew, and this time I turned because the acoustics of the warehouse had been warning me two seconds, and because respect requires performance if you\u2019re going to pretend to govern while alive or while adjacent. Alma stood twenty paces away with her hands in her coat pockets, a posture designed to suggest she would not touch anything without permission and to remind you she could. Saffron stood behind her with the specific misery of someone whose job did not include watching a choir assemble in her warehouse. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not the only one who reads our stationery.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me you saved me,\u201d I said, holding the tag between two fingers the way one holds something found in a wound. \u201cYou said you shut it down before it reached the news. Did you shut it down with this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shut it down with a phone call and a bill of lading,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tried to pay out on an accident that hadn\u2019t happened yet. My girls in Accounts don\u2019t like paradox. I don\u2019t like it either. It makes numbers behave like weather. We pulled the footage and put it in an envelope. We licked the envelope closed with spit like the old ways, because the new ways have a worm in them.\u201d She glanced at North with the acknowledgment one instrument gives another in an orchestra pit where they pretend to be strangers. \u201cThe tag is a mischief. Someone wanted a clean chain-of-custody, and someone else wanted to cut the chain and tie it to a different ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour half-star is on my country,\u201d I said. The anger came not in heat but with a clarity the air recognized. \u201cIt\u2019s on the thing that maybe killed me and on the thing you used to recognize me after the fact. I can\u2019t tell whether my jurisdiction ends at my skin or whether you nailed it to my door when I wasn\u2019t home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my half-star,\u201d she said, and for the first time, a small thing in her voice tipped, like a glass bumping another glass at a toast. \u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s. We didn\u2019t invent it. We inherited it from the last era where papers were more powerful than knives. The split means: provisional. The circle in it means: diverted. You have a provisional mark on a thing that wasn\u2019t supposed to be diverted. That means somebody declared you eligible for a cut that did not belong to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cCut,\u201d Brazos said, because he hears cuts in everything, in tape, in frame lines, in throats. \u201cOf what.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf time,\u201d North said, very gently, as if he were telling a scared animal that fences are sometimes just suggestions. \u201cThey took your future and they put it through an editor who had been asked to deliver a different length. They will have had a reason. Reasons are the knives people use when evidence goes sour.\u201d\n\nI slid the tag into my pocket and felt the plastic settle as if I had put a stone in a stream and altered a current that pretended its path had been inevitable. Jonah had been watching us for five minutes, because actors learn to stand behind things and pretend they have just arrived, and when the quiet that followed my pocket\u2019s new weight made a space he could enter without owning it, he entered. He had a paper cup that had been coffee and was now a prop. His face did the thing it does when he has to say something he knows will harm but maybe heal later, which is not a thing he invented for television but a thing television borrowed from his life.\n\n\u201cI told you about the Aegis because the people who murmur in my room wanted me to,\u201d he said, and he didn\u2019t look at Alma because that would have elevated them both in a way he knew better than to do when life was waiting for a punch line. \u201cThey told me not to tell you about the other program because you don\u2019t like programs that are about you as a processing unit. I agree with them. I\u2019m telling you anyway. It\u2019s called Stills.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill as in quiet,\u201d Luca said. \u201cOr still as in leftover. Or still as in the thing you use to make liquor in a place where making liquor is worn like a sin in bright jewelry.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill as in: stop,\u201d Jonah said. \u201cThey arrest moments and they render them potable. They\u2019re a private concern but they post their results like science. They\u2019re the ones who make the tech that can take a face and stretch it six more episodes. They\u2019re the whisper in a writer\u2019s mouth that says: no one will notice if you replace her. If you are a state now, you are a competitor. Countries have their own stills. They call them museums.\u201d\n\nAlma\u2019s mouth flattened into a line that reminded me of a horizon drawn by an exhausted child. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because you would have gone there and broken your skull on their glass,\u201d she said. \u201cNow you will go there and we will go with you and maybe we will break their glass with a bill of lading. I can\u2019t promise you we won\u2019t cut our hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they drink what they make,\u201d North asked, and Alma\u2019s eyes flicked to him with interest, because the question had entered the room like a man who doesn\u2019t knock.\n\n\u201cThey ship,\u201d she said. \u201cThey export. They season their cash with our excuses. And they sell insurance to the people who fear the tide. It\u2019s a good business, fearing the tide. The tide is punctual. It makes its own case.\u201d\n\nWe stood by the car that had been a coffin and then a prop and then a piece of history that refused to pick a lane. I thought of the bathroom mirror where the glass had agreed to act like wind. I thought of the frost grown out of the metal the way grief grows out of bone. I thought of the girl at the end of the row practicing her smile and wanted, very suddenly, to teach her how to practice saying no without turning the sound into a weapon. I thought of the ridiculousness that had taken on shape and gotten stamped: my country, my flag, my anthem that was a hush.\n\n\u201cWhat happens if I walk into Stills as a head of state,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happens if I walk in as a dead woman who has a tongue and a seal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will bring you tea and a clipboard,\u201d Alma said, with a lack of romance that I appreciated the way thirsty people appreciate tap water. \u201cThey will show you a tour where the windows do not look out. They will attempt to make you an offer. They will suggest that the best way to solve your problem is to let professionals frame it. They will be right and wrong in equal measure. And then they will tell you that a provisional recognition can be rescinded with enough signatures. They will point at your flag on news feeds and talk about instability. It will make an excellent headline for a morning panel. Try to look like you enjoy breakfast.\u201d\n\nNorth had moved to the other side of the rig and was standing very still, his hand at head height as if measuring the world. He had a way of stillness that wasn\u2019t an absence but a decision. \u201cSomeone touched this metal with a glove that had powder on it,\u201d he said. \u201cNot shop chalk. A finer dust. Like the stuff they put on hands before glassblowing. They sealed something around you that should have let heat out. It didn\u2019t. It turned the heat into a container and left your outline behind as a draft.\u201d He lowered his hand like a man putting down a book. \u201cWe can follow drafts. But the person who knows how to lay that kind of line learned it from a place that teaches people to move without leaving footprints.\u201d\n\n\u201cStills,\u201d Jonah said, and sorry sat in his voice like a stone in a river, not stopping anything, just altering flow. \u201cOr someone who left their lab and took the lab with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to break their glass,\u201d Luca said. She had picked up a stray bolt from the floor and was rolling it in her palm as if it were thinking. \u201cYou can fog it. You already can. If they built their windows to keep heat in, not out, they might think they\u2019re safe from someone who is a current instead of a wall.\u201d She placed the bolt on the nearby table and pressed her palm next to it. Her skin left a print you could see, the normal human spoor, and where my skin touched an inch away, no print appeared, but when I lifted my hand the condensation clung to the air for a second longer than it should have, like webbing between fingers that weren\u2019t there. \u201cIf they use rooms, use hallways. If they use halls, use stairs. The Interim can be a stairwell. It suits you. You were always better going up than being in a room at the same height.\u201d\n\nWe made a plan the way plans are made by people who do not trust plans. We placed it on a table and stood around it and did not pretend it would survive contact with people. Alma would get us through the front door with the formalities photographers like. North would take us out the back door if the formalities turned carnivorous. Luca would carry the flag and also our common sense. I would stand in the spot the room thought it had laid out for me and then move three inches to the left. You would be surprised how often that knocks a hierarchy onto its keys.\n\nOn the way out, Carlotta texted me a video of the bathroom mirror at Stage E. The glass filmed over with frost and then cleared and then filmed again, like breathing. There was no one in the room. There was no sound. She sent a second text that only said, keep doing your skin care, babe, and a row of snowflakes, her attempt at levity a little jagged around the edges. I sent back a lipstick and a flag because sometimes hieroglyphs are the only currency safe to spend.\n\nWe drove to the Stills compound the way people go to funerals: dressed like a version of themselves that would pass. The building sat in a part of the city that used to be brickyards and is now clean lines and confident glass, the kind of architecture that says: bad things don\u2019t happen here, they happen in places you already decided you don\u2019t live in. The sign on the glass said stills in lowercase and kindness in the font you use to sell oat milk. Inside, the air smelled like a dentist\u2019s office where the fillings tell you stories if you bother to ask. A woman at the desk asked for my name and then performed surprise like a professional, which is not a criticism. You do what you\u2019re paid to do.\n\n\u201cCustodian Leland,\u201d she said, and the word custodian nearly made me smile because of the mop joke and because it felt like a word that might behave if you told it a bedtime story. \u201cWe\u2019re honored. We weren\u2019t informed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither were we,\u201d Alma said, which was true in a way that could be papered over easily later. \u201cWe\u2019re here to see your director. Tell them the Interim is visiting. Tell them we\u2019re willing to be bored if the boredom comes with access. Tell them we brought our own tea.\u201d\n\nThe receptionist blinked like a modem trying to decide whether it was necessary to make noise. She made a call. She made another call. Two men appeared wearing the clothes of people who exercise to keep the devil out. They said words like welcome and transparency and oversight and you\u2019re safe here, which are words that have had the varnish rubbed off them by hands all over the world. The lobby had no corners and no plants. The light came from nowhere you could point at. It was an honest trick.\n\nThey put us in a conference room where the glass was two-way, no matter what they believed they had bought. The table was a shade that would not mar under cutlery, and in the center a low bowl held stones that were meant to look like river stones, except none of them had the interesting flaws carburetors leave when water ragged with history moves through machinery. The door shut with a hush that had money in it.\n\nA woman came in with a suit fitted like a sentence diagram. She held her head the way you do when you have learned you can stop headaches by walking properly. She said her name was Magdalene Pike and shook my hand without flinching, which I gave her points for even if the points didn\u2019t count in the game we were playing. Her palm was the temperature of rooms in museums where they keep the small paintings that soldiers hid in barns. You never forget the way that kind of climate control feels.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Stills,\u201d she said. \u201cYou raised a flag. Congratulations. We like flags. They clarify the air. You\u2019re going to ask me about the flip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you about a sticker,\u201d I said, laying the tag on the table like a coin you put down in a bar when you are about to make trouble and would prefer to frame it as commerce. \u201cWhich of your programs uses this mark.\u201d\n\nShe smiled very slightly, the mouth equivalent of a rubber band around a bundle of papers to keep them neat. \u201cWe consult for many programs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe inherit symbols as often as we invent them. That mark indicates that something has been protected while its ownership is resolved. It is a kindness we apply when people panic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very soothed,\u201d Luca said, sitting back as if about to recount a recipe to a woman who had never owned salt. \u201cWhen you protect something, who decides when it is no longer protected. Who decides where you put it after you\u2019re done protecting it. Who gets the key to the lockbox when you go out of business or become a tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t go out of business,\u201d Pike said. \u201cWe change business. And we consult the proper authorities. The Directory is one. The Courts of Account are another. Your Choir, Ms. Leland, are particularly fond of advisory votes, which we find charming. It is nice when civic bodies perform their arithmetic aloud. So many numbers prefer to be whispered.\u201d\n\nAlma watched her with the hospitality you offer a neighbor you will one day need to borrow a ladder from. \u201cYou had a woman and a laminate at our set,\u201d she said. \u201cYou had a glove with dust meant for glass. You have a habit of moving grief to warehouses where it can be measured and then sold back to the family at a discount. I can\u2019t stop you from building your rooms. I can ask you to tell us who asked you to build yours around my girl.\u201d\n\nPike did a small elegant thing with her eyes that was not a roll and not a blink and not a wink. It was the gesture people do when they tug a thread in their own weave to see if it will hold. \u201cYour girl is an adult,\u201d she said. \u201cShe engages with risk for money. She knows the cost of exposure. We all do, in our ways. We had a client who requested that in the event of an accident at your location, all expressive assets be retained for review. The request came to us stamped with a half-star. We accepted the request. We held. The client rescinded before we had developed a plan. We released your assets into the wild. They returned to you. We never even wrote an invoice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho,\u201d North said, and the word did not carry a threat, only the weight of any question a person asks at a door, and sometimes doors answer because politeness is a code older than laws.\n\n\u201cThe client designated themselves as an intermediary for a consortium,\u201d Pike said. \u201cYou know their type. People who love to sit above a pool of voices and call it a decision. The name on the remit was R. Kincaid. The money came from a fund called Weather. There\u2019s a contact address here.\u201d She slid a card across the table that was not a card but a scrap of paper cut from larger paper, torn on one short side and smelling faintly of eucalyptus and ink dried quickly to avoid fingerprints. \u201cWe do not enjoy conflict with governments. We prefer to sell them extra minutes and sell the fruit water that makes the minutes easier to swallow. You came here as a state. We will treat you as one. Please don\u2019t pass resolutions under my roof. It scuffs.\u201d\n\nI picked up the scrap and folded it once. The act made the air tilt. North\u2019s head turned half a degree as if something in the room had moved that wasn\u2019t furniture. Through the glass, two drones paused mid-flight and realized they had been told to wait. The bowl of stones looked theatrical for the first time, like props in a play about a river that refused to be on time.\n\n\u201cWe will not vandalize your lobby,\u201d I said. \u201cWe will pay for the tea we did not drink. We will take our sticker and our half-star and our circle and our problem, and we will go outside and fight in the way that does not attract security. If we need a tour, we will ask for one and pretend to enjoy the windows.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Pike said. \u201cWhen you have found the person who made the request, you may discover that they had a reason you approve of. It happens all the time. That is why we keep our empathy in small bottles. It makes dosing easier.\u201d\n\nIn the elevator down, the music made a small apology for not being music. Luca was folding the scrap into smaller and smaller squares the way she does when she wants to make an idea occupy less space in her pocket. Alma leaned her head against the mirror and for a second her smile scratched the silver backing and left a mark that wouldn\u2019t buff out. North closed his eyes and said a direction under his breath so quietly I almost didn\u2019t catch it.\n\n\u201cSouth,\u201d he said, and I laughed because it was a relief to have a joke sneak in through a gap the room had left by accident. The elevator stopped at a floor we hadn\u2019t chosen and opened on a corridor that did not belong to a building that had been put on the permit application. The carpet was office neutral, the kind that forgives coffee and rage. The air was the gray of a thought someone had been told not to finish. It was an annex. It made sense that it would be here, because anything that profits from arrested time will build a hallway you cannot schedule.\n\n\u201cWe are not in your house,\u201d Alma said, and the we covered more than the bodies in the elevator. \u201cAre we in mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a door between,\u201d North said. \u201cInterim territory. You can set flags here if you are fast. The people who like to own thresholds hate it when you collect tolls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no tolls,\u201d Luca said. \u201cWe have taxes forgiven upon evidence of sincerity.\u201d\n\n\u201cTolls are a kind of test,\u201d North murmured, and the muscles in his jaw made a decision that had nothing to do with teeth.\n\nI stepped out of the elevator because in the end what I am good at is stepping out onto things in front of witnesses. The corridor felt like standing inside my bathroom mirror when it had decided to try being wind. The wall on the left had a door marked Weather, and the door had a pinhole camera in it that did not blink when we moved. The smell coming from under it was coin and rosemary and the faint singe of a filament bulb about to fail.\n\n\u201cDo we knock,\u201d Luca said, and the question was real and not, the way a childhood friend\u2019s hand on yours before you jump from the bridge is real and not.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s for houses. This is a cut.\u201d\n\nI pressed my palm to the door and watched frost write itself in a script I had not learned but recognized. Behind the door, someone who had smiled earlier without moving their face moved. I could feel it the way you can feel the weather decide.\n\n\u201cCustodian,\u201d said a voice that had spent its life surviving and winning quiet auctions. \u201cInterim is not a state. It\u2019s a mood.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoods pass,\u201d I said, and kept my hand where it was until the cold agreed we were in a negotiation. \u201cWe make ours a place. We brought a stamp.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first time the air bent around you, you learned to lie for an audience,\u201d the voice said, and I did not have to look at Luca to know she was about to break someone\u2019s window. \u201cTry not to lie to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou killed me,\u201d I said, and it came out not as accusation but as homework. \u201cOr you tried to. Or you bent the power of trying in the direction of my absence. Use your words.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe rescued you from an ending you had not earned and replaced it with one you could use,\u201d the voice said, and the room made a microscopic sound that could have been a laugh or could have been a building\u2019s idea of a shrug. \u201cYou are better now. You are interesting. We take nothing without leaving something behind. It\u2019s theology. It\u2019s commerce.\u201d\n\nAlma\u2019s breath cut the air like a ribbon. \u201cOpen your door,\u201d she said, and I didn\u2019t know if I had ever heard anyone be so gracious while starting a war. \u201cOr I will condemn your corridor as a fire hazard in fourteen jurisdictions and your board will have to hold their next meeting in the parking lot.\u201d\n\nThe lock clicked the way a small animal does when it realizes the hand reaching for it has food and teeth. The door opened on a room that had been designed to photograph well at every angle. A person sat behind a desk that could have been salvaged from a ship or bought yesterday; a woman with hair in a bun that had done philosopher\u2019s work; a window beyond her that looked out on nothing we could name. The plaque on the desk said KINCAID, and beside it lay a bowl of wax that had ruined gold waiting on its surface, a patient mirror of my own.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty,\u201d Kincaid said to me, but the adjective had nothing to do with faces. It had to do with shapes that fit inside systems and still spill a little. \u201cThat\u2019s inconvenient for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cConvenience is not in our anthem,\u201d I said, and my hand had print on it now, something like chalk and colder than bone. \u201cYou tagged me. You held me. You released me. I want the chain you cut. I want the names that stood behind yours when you signed. I want the lesson plan you wrote about what happens when a thing you\u2019ve filed tries to breathe.\u201d\n\nKincaid looked at the seal in my hand and smiled, this time with her face, and you could see why someone had put her behind a desk and asked her to pretend the world liked desks. \u201cCustodian,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you take dictation.\u201dKincaid\u2019s question lay on the desk like a blade turned sideways, not cutting yet, only consenting to be noticed. Dictation is not a neutral instrument. In the old cities, the clerk who took it was the person the room agreed to remember, and memory has always been a kind of crown. Luca\u2019s hand went to her pocket without looking, found a pen with teeth marks and a small notebook she used for recipes and enemies. She put them on the desk beside the bowl of wax as if she were laying out implements for surgery and dessert.\n\n\u201cI take dictation,\u201d she said, and her tone did not ask permission. \u201cI have witnesses. I have a seal. I am not an officer of your company and therefore my page is unbuyable. If you dictate, you will be read.\u201d\n\nAlma didn\u2019t sit, which was her way of being generous to a chair. North did sit and became so still the air seemed to practice around him. You learn that in hospitals; you learn it in prisons; you learn it in holes. Kincaid tipped her head the way people who have met dogs do when they prepare their hand and their scent and their posture not to startle. She reached for the wax bowl, dipped her finger and thumb, and pressed a smear on the edge of Luca\u2019s notebook like a signature translated into texture.\n\n\u201cFor the Minutes of the Interim,\u201d she said calmly, and the words made the room decide to become a courtroom for exactly the length of a heartbeat. \u201cChain-of-custody on asset LE-ML-772413, request received by Weather on day 209 of fiscal cycle. Mark applied: half-star, provisional; circle indicating diversion authority. Intermediary: R. Kincaid, empowered by five signatures under the Accounts in Precaution charter. Upstream pool: consortium named River & Hedge, constituents redacted by their own agreement but containing entities you do business with when you buy billboard space in Nice. Instruction: In the event of catastrophic interruption of expressive output, freeze and retain residual until ownership clarified. Trigger: compliance notice from studio counsel indicating a stunt escalation not documented in the original risk plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudio counsel,\u201d I said, and the words stood on their own and did not fall. The stunt escalation had been a rumor, like a hawk shadow. We had not escalated. Brazos would sooner eat film than escalate without ceremony.\n\nKincaid kept her eyes on Luca\u2019s hand. \u201cThe escalation was fake,\u201d she said. \u201cSo was the compliance notice. A laminate that looked laminated twice, as Brazos would say, for a double gloss of legitimacy. We are not fools, but we are practiced at believing paper that smells like our paper. The request was pre-cleared; it had the Directory on it in a signature we have seen in less operatic contexts. It had a Choir watermark that may have been laid by a printer bought from us and tuned by your people. We applied the tag to the environment, not the person, which is how we behave when we are good. We did not touch your flesh. We altered the chamber around it so that heat would not write a new story without our note at the bottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour glove,\u201d North said, and his own hands remained on his knees, palms up the way you sit when you are prepared to receive an object that might bite.\n\n\u201cThe glove belongs to a toolroom that hires to many houses,\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cStills uses it. So do forensic photographers. So do glassblowers. So do people who salvage stained glass from blown churches. If you want to be angry\u2014and I encourage civic anger in modest doses\u2014be angry at the way a tool learns pass-phrases by passing through hands. Be angry at the man in gray. You will say his name is generic and I will say generic is a color and many uniforms wear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemit was rescinded,\u201d Alma said, each verb a fencepost. \u201cThe call was mine. Your people answered. They had already made their little room. They like to make rooms; it makes them feel like city planners. I told them I would requisition their minutes for a hearing and they very politely told me I could requisition their ashes. You released the mark because you like to avoid hearings. Name your price for collaborating with a government and surviving the paperwork with your nails intact.\u201d\n\nKincaid smiled with her whole mouth and let herself be seen enjoying the taste of the word survive. \u201cYou like to act as if we live off indemnity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t. We live off the way mornings line up in people\u2019s heads. Our clients panic when mornings tangle. We sell them combs. Sometimes we sell them a haircut. In your case, we were prepared to sell you time. We decided not to when we realized you would be better at selling it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho authorized the hold,\u201d I said. \u201cNot in title. In person. I want a name I can stand in front of. It can be a first name. It can be the name a mother uses when she wants to stop a child from sticking a fork into a socket. If you are about to say R. Kincaid, decide whether you prefer to be interesting or consistent.\u201d\n\nLuca\u2019s pen made a sound that writing makes when it knows it is about to be quoted at a conference later. Kincaid looked at me the way one judge looks at another across a feast where no one has eaten yet. \u201cThe Directory\u2019s signature came from a person who has always believed in provisional instruments,\u201d she said softly, and she let Alma see the softness because soft can be used as a solvent. \u201cI do not know if she wrote it or if her pen did. The name on the Directory line was Anahi Cuevas.\u201d\n\nThe name blew through the room as if someone had opened a valve in the past. I had been carrying Anahi around in my pocket since I put my hand in and found a seal. I knew the shape of her vowels without having met their owner, because some people become grammar before they are saints. Alma did not change color. None of her changed. The change was the room\u2019s. The air recognized an old song and wished it had learned the harmony.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d she said. It qualified as a courtesy. It gives a person a second chance to do something less clumsy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dictating,\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cYou can staple it to my notice board. Anahi\u2019s hand has been on our requisitions for small things for years. It\u2019s practical\u2014small things get things done. We assumed she had extended her remit because your house had sprung a leak. We applied your mop. We intended to file cleanly. Then the call came; it wasn\u2019t hers. It was yours. We undid our own ribbon. We barely had time to write a notation: \u2018Diversion reversed by Choir\u2014defer.\u2019 If you think the man in gray cared about our notation, you haven\u2019t been to a room like the one he uses. He wasn\u2019t our tool. He was someone else\u2019s following a map we didn\u2019t draw.\u201d\n\nLuca wrote the words defer and reversed and then drew a small flag beside them the way children decorate their margins when the body wants to do something that isn\u2019t sitting. I watched Alma\u2019s mouth for signs of regret and saw none. She doesn\u2019t wear regret where people can match it with fabric. She stores it under floorboards and burns it late.\n\n\u201cIf Anahi\u2019s hand is on that paper, it is because she built the mechanism that gets water to the fires before the neighbors notice the smell,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cWe assign our people authority and then we live with it. Sometimes they use it in ways we didn\u2019t discuss at the last soup. Sometimes they use it so perfectly the room thinks it designed itself. I will find out which this is. You won\u2019t do it for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not find her,\u201d Kincaid said, and allowed herself a kindness I did not expect from her face. \u201cShe is at a distance from all of us on purpose. It makes her work keep working even when we remember to tie our shoes.\u201d\n\nNorth lifted his head by a half-inch. He hears distances the way other men hear flirtation. \u201cDead,\u201d he said gently, which was not a question but the kind of flinch a person makes for another person. Kincaid\u2019s eyes danced over his face like moths trying to decide if a light is a lamp or a trap.\n\n\u201cAbsent,\u201d she said. \u201cUnavailable. In governance, those are different words. In grief, they are not.\u201d\n\nLuca closed the notebook around the wax smear with a small decisive snap. \u201cDictation noted,\u201d she said. \u201cYour bowl smells like rosemary. Your company smells like coins. Your name smells like rain you promised and delivered on people who did not ask for it. We\u2019ll take the scrap and the sticker and the absence and go file a complaint against a color.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore you do,\u201d Kincaid said, and she reached into the drawer where good pens live and took out something that looked like a business card and smelled like the inside of a violin case, \u201cconsider an offer. Not a rescue. Not a haircut. A contract between your Interim and our Weather. We\u2019re tired of the met\u00e0, the thing we built to persuade investors that weather is a product. You just raised a flag over the time between. Co-govern it with us. You put your stamp on days when the air bends. We pay you to host our minutes when they pertain to people who live in the in-betweens. You become the ledger. When they come for you, the paperwork fights back.\u201d\n\nAlma bristled like an animal consulting a map of fences. \u201cShe is not your compliance arm,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is not your fig leaf. She is a person who can run a country without land like some of us run rooms without walls. You do not get to plant a mailbox in her mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlma,\u201d I said, and it surprised both of us. \u201cDo you tell me to say no because you are protecting me or because you want your Choir to keep all the songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe distinction is bureaucratic,\u201d she said wryly. \u201cAnd boring. Say no because you are not finished with your yes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain the clarity that arrives when the room decides you\u2019re in charge. It\u2019s not ego. It\u2019s an adjustment in the way corners behave. The bowl of stones on the conference table next door remembered they were not river stones; the two men in exercise clothes adjusted their weight onto their heels like cops instructed to be polite; the receptionist downstairs thought hard about the habit of standing when a woman with a flag walks past and practiced it without moving. I put the card from Kincaid in my pocket because you don\u2019t turn down a bridge before you know which valley you will have to jump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use your minutes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to use our name. You do not put Interim on your prospectus. You will send us notices you would usually bury in footers. I will read them aloud. I am very good at reading aloud.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend us any paper with a half-star,\u201d Luca added. \u201cWe have strong feelings about geometry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend them through me,\u201d Alma said, because songs travel in braids backstage.\n\nKincaid stood, and the room remembered desks had been designed to make people stand to gain power. She came around the desk with the sympathetic tilt of a person who\u2019s seen horses balk at bridges and learned to take a step first so the animal feels invited. She held out her hand again, and I gave her mine because my whole job is pretending palms can agree to what mouths have promised. Her skin was careful. \u201cThe person who grayed your day,\u201d she said, so low that only the paper heard and perhaps the bowl of wax, \u201cused to sweep floors at Stills and learned more from silence than our engineers learn from grants. He calls himself Halberd if he has to answer in rooms with windows. He will change the name by noon. He reads the immunities list like other men read love poems. He will try to make you accept that death is a version. He will be wrong, but he will be persuasive. Don\u2019t hire him. He\u2019ll be better at the job than your own heart.\u201d\n\nNorth breathed in once as if the shape of the air had contained that name and had been waiting to lay it down in him. Luca tucked the sound away with other small sounds she would use later like tools. Alma put her hands back in her pockets and the pockets sighed with relief.\n\nWe left Weather without anyone escorting us, which in that kind of building is the only courtesy you trust. In the annex corridor, the carpet looked closer to brown than gray, which felt like a win. The elevator was waiting with its apology music and its ambition to close quickly. We rode down like a box of fragile things teaching itself to be stone.\n\nOutside, the sky had the color of a public swimming pool after a rainstorm. Drones did their sibling orbit. A street vendor sold oranges the way church ladies sell salvation, quickly, to people who didn\u2019t know they were hungry. The flag of Interim on my apartment had become a template a few neighborhoods over; someone else had raised it with a white ribbon through the blue-gray, and the line wavered like a sincere hand. The city decided that when bands don\u2019t know a song they can still keep time, and so tires hummed and buses hissed and a child yelled at a pigeon and refused to say sorry.\n\nDax called before Alma said anything mean about Kincaid\u2019s eyebrows. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. He doesn\u2019t say hello because his language is a theater where he\u2019s already in act two when he arrives. \u201cThe rumor machine is producing cotton candy. You went to Stills. Your flag is a filter. You\u2019re bleeding fans into governance, which is weird branding but apparently plays in kitchens. If you\u2019re going to make a statement, do it with a cup in your hand. People trust a droplet. Smile like you\u2019re cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to act for that,\u201d I said. \u201cWe met their Weather. We got a name.\u201d I told him about Halberd with the caution you use when you tell someone about a person who looks like a concept from far away and like a hand at your throat from here.\n\nDax didn\u2019t pause. He is always feeding a spreadsheet hidden under the seat of his car. \u201cWe\u2019ll get three conflicting Halberds by morning,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cOne will be a drummer; one will be a gym; one will be a grant application. In the meantime, don\u2019t call him. Let him find you. People who change their names like to test their work.\u201d He inhaled with that carefulness men have when they are weighing whether to step over a threshold their paycheck did not cover. \u201cMira,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re fine if you\u2019re dead. We can sell that. We\u2019re also fine if you\u2019re a country. We can sell that. Please don\u2019t get in the middle of a regulatory reform round with a company that underwrites stadiums. It\u2019s ungenteel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am literally the State of the Middle,\u201d I said, and he sighed and hung up and texted me three gifs of flags he thought were pretty, each uglier than the last and each with a color named after money.\n\nWe stood on the sidewalk and committed the old civic sin of blocking pedestrian traffic while being interesting. North touched my elbow with the appraising lightness a tailor uses. \u201cDo you want a street,\u201d he said, almost shy, and when I looked at him, his eyes were a language I could not name and had no trouble reading. \u201cSometimes when people have flags they need streets. We can draw one. It won\u2019t stay all day. It will be there as long as people believe they can cross without being hit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should ask Saffron for permission,\u201d Luca said, looking up at a sky that had opinions and a day that might change them. \u201cShe likes to say yes to rules that feel like rules. We\u2019ll call it a pop-up ceremony and tell the drones before we tell the people.\u201d\n\nAlma had been watching the door of the building, not because she expected pursuit but because professionals always look at the place trouble comes from even when they know trouble doesn\u2019t need doors. \u201cHe\u2019ll test you before dusk,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll choose a place you think you own. He\u2019ll try to close it around you the way he closed heat around your bones. He expects you to push. Don\u2019t push. Permission and apology are architecture. You know it; use it.\u201d\n\nWe drew a street on the asphalt with the kind of chalk sold to children and municipal workers. North knelt and drew a line that did not wobble even when bus brakes exhaled nearby. He took the chalk and made it leave marks where chalk behaves badly: on paint, on the slick patches where oil courts dust, on the place where rain had dried and left a map of a bay. He drew a border that was two lines with breathing room between them. He wrote: INTERIM, in letters a child would like because they could trace them. Luca stood at one end and raised the broom-handle flag, and the fabric learned the wind of a street like a dance partner you can trust to lead once and follow twice.\n\nWe didn\u2019t make a speech. We put down the bowl of ruined-gold wax on the curb and let people look at it if they wanted. A woman with hands like a teacher\u2019s touched the seal and did not flinch because she has daughters. A courier on a bike swore very politely in two languages and then went around us. A boy in a sweatshirt that said NOT A PHASE took a picture and sent it to someone who would send him three exclamation points and a heart. The air noticed. It bent; it adjusted; it consented to carry a new sign.\n\nHe came to us on foot, not because he was humble but because cars make noise, and men like him prefer rooms to take the credit for their arrival. He wore a suit that was committed to gray the way certain mushrooms are committed to wood. His face was the kind you forget until you see it again and then your memory tries to file it under trap or cousin. He carried nothing in his hands and too much in his shoulders. In another life he kept night schedules for a factory where the lights pretended to be dawn for the sake of flesh. North straightened not defensively but as a man who has recognized a mountain in clouds.\n\n\u201cHalberd,\u201d I said, because I have learned the trick of using a name as a rope.\n\nHe smiled with something that did not quite reach the walk back of his mouth. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s for the rooms that need weapons to keep people from sitting too long. Call me Howell. That\u2019s today\u2019s version. It wears well and it looks good on a mailbox. You\u2019ve drawn a beautiful street. It looks like a game children play when they are teaching a yard to obey.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren do not teach yards,\u201d Luca said. \u201cThey invite them. The acceptance is labor. Don\u2019t belittle labor in this house.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged her with a nod like someone stamping paper he didn\u2019t write. His eyes told me he knew both of us well enough to have learned the difference between politeness and hospitality, and chose politeness because it stains less. He took a step onto the chalk. Chalk is inexpensive; it offers very little resistance; it is a boundary beloved of people who do not enjoy blood. The moment his shoe crossed the line, the air did a small trick with its own gravity, and he had to adjust his weight, which he did like someone who grew up on boats.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t build traps,\u201d he said. \u201cTraps suggest you know what the thing you\u2019re catching will look like when you catch it. I build rooms. Rooms are honest. They announce themselves as boundaries. They persuade by offering shelter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sealed a girl into a heatless box,\u201d North said, and the tenderness in his voice made the sentence heavier than anger would have. \u201cYou built her a shelter that was also a coffin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe built a pause,\u201d Howell said. \u201cShe was on fire. Everything she touched belonged to other people. The car, the harness, the camera, the insurance policy. Her breath belonged to three platforms and an offshore trust. She was going to die very publicly and it would have been a mess, and I hate mess. We turned the room down. We took her heat and stored it. We gave it back. Look at her; your duct taster rescued her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou put your tag in our rig like a fisherman who releases a fish and then surprises the lake,\u201d Brazos said from beside the curb, and I hadn\u2019t seen him come up because good men with rope hands can arrive without shame or preamble. \u201cDo you plan to build walls at my funerals too, or do you prefer your wakes private.\u201d\n\nHowell\u2019s smile didn\u2019t approve and didn\u2019t not. It was adjudication and it was habit. \u201cIf I built rooms at funerals they would be beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople would thank me for the light.\u201d He turned to me and tilted his head the way a buyer does when he is not quite sure how much the thing is worth and is excited to find out. \u201cWalk with me. Your street will hold. I promise not to poach your minutes.\u201d\n\nHe was right about the street. It held, not because chalk is strong but because belief is. Belief is a species of weight. We walked to the end, past the flag that was behaving like fabric aware of choreography, past the wax bowl catching dust like a sacrament. He kept his hands visible, which was a kindness. Men who build boundaries can evade where they hide an edge.\n\n\u201cYou died,\u201d he said, not as a triumph, and not as a threat, and he had the luck to say it like someone confessing to a natural disaster. \u201cIt was quick. It was not a horror. There is footage you will never watch because you are not a ghoul. We had you for fifty-seven minutes. We failed to keep you because your Choir arrived with a better story. We let you go. You went. What you brought back isn\u2019t what most people bring back. Most people bring back a visible limp. You brought back a jurisdiction. That is annoying. It is also interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou changed the math,\u201d I said. \u201cYou wrote a grammar on top of a day and expected no one to notice because you used one of the old alphabets. When I put my hand on the mirror, it wrote back. That is your handwriting. I felt the chalk in your glove. Why me. You have other cars. You have other mouths. What did you intend to do with my heat. Sell it in vials to people who fear losing their cheeks on camera.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged like a bridge that knows it is sound. \u201cWe planned to pour it into your catalog. Not yours alone. They bought the option to season your archive with you. You would have made them a fortune from beyond. We would have taken our tithe and funded a library. You think we are villains. We are bookkeepers with a flair for weather. Your dying tidy and coming home untidy ruins our margins. It undoes an elegant plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe elegant plan had my sister crying on a ceramic floor,\u201d Luca said, and her voice had the varnish ripped off. \u201cIf you come within ten feet of our kitchen again I will show you what a flag is for when we\u2019re not playing at ceremonies.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her with the respectful patience men show to threats they will put on a shelf and dust. \u201cApologies,\u201d he said, and North made a tiny approving sound, because apology is a key and Howell had found the right pocket for it. \u201cYour kitchen is yours. Your sister\u2019s breath is hers unless she sells it, which she has done like all of us who forgot our first mouths. Custodian,\u201d he added, switching registers like a linguist, \u201chere is a gift, because gifts entangle and I like a crowd. There is a person in your Choir who will tell you they signed because someone had to keep the paper from going to the worst house. They are right and wrong at once. Indoor women always are. If you approach them with a knife, they will convince you it\u2019s a butter spreader and you will end up feeding each other toast. If you approach with a bowl, they will fill it. Decide which breakfast you prefer.\u201d\n\n\u201cNames,\u201d I said, because I can be rude when it matters and when it doesn\u2019t. \u201cWith vowels.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t smile that time. He considered the wax bowl on the curb the way people consider wishing wells. \u201cThey taught me to call her Sparrow,\u201d he said finally. \u201cThat is not a name; it is a license. In the Directory she is not there, which tells you everything. Find her in places people put constructs to make rooms work better. She will be where elevators decide to stop for breath. She will be in signs. You will know her by the way printers jam when she stands near them. She is Anahi\u2019s apprentice and substitute and sometimes shadow. She eats paper when it makes her nervous and leaves the corners soft.\u201d\n\nAlma said a word in another language that was probably used by women in kitchens when the cupboards began to sprout clever mice. It wasn\u2019t a curse; it was a reminder of what to take off the shelf next. \u201cMy Sparrow is not yours,\u201d she said to Howell. \u201cIf you have touched her, I will raise a bridge under your building and make you live politely above a river you didn\u2019t order.\u201d\n\nHe bowed, as much to hospitality as to threat. \u201cWe don\u2019t recruit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe beckon. She didn\u2019t come. She likes being essential too much to join a house that calls itself a product. Custodian, you will get your murderer by Thursday if you go at him like a person who wants to fix something she broke. If you go as a queen, he will break a different thing and make you decide whether the Interim collects taxes after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will you do,\u201d North asked, not unkindly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get to keep your pause. You lost your invoice. Men like you mind invoices more than blood.\u201d\n\nHowell\u2019s face softened briefly into the man who, in another era, would have liked to fix radios for his neighbors. \u201cI will do what I always do,\u201d he said. \u201cBuild rooms where people have to say what they mean to get out. And then I will go somewhere with weather and pretend I feel it.\u201d\n\nHe stepped off our chalk with the respect a person reserves for a stranger\u2019s grave. He walked away with the speed of a man who has put an end to conversation in a way that leaves everyone feeling they got their portion. The street filled with noise again, which is the sound of peace if you squint. The flag looked content; flags do, briefly, when they\u2019ve been used properly.\n\nWe stood as people came and went around us and pretended not to memorize our faces. Luca poured a little of the wax onto the edge of the chalk line and pressed the seal into it, and the half-star took. The impression looked odd on asphalt, like a signature on a mountain. North leaned close to the mark and breathed on it as if he were putting a baby to sleep. The wax cooled. It did not flake.\n\n\u201cWe have a Sparrow,\u201d Alma said dryly. \u201cOf course we do. She would have been tucked under my arm this whole time like a catalog if she weren\u2019t halfway smoke. We\u2019ll call elevators. We\u2019ll find out which ones skip floor twelve when she is tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask Carlotta,\u201d I said. \u201cShe knows the places where paper gathers and goes to gossip. She also knows who eats anxiety for breakfast and calls it fiber.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall Jonah,\u201d Luca said. \u201cHe will know a Sparrow by posture. He has acted sparrows since he was twelve. He has made a vocation of tiny bones.\u201d\n\nWe went home because plans look better on kitchen tables. Home smelled like rosemary and ruined gold and the soft drink that only exists when tea cools in a room you are not in. The flag we had left in the window had learned to lift and lay itself down like breathing. On my counter the Directory had selected a page to be open when I arrived, which is a trick I didn\u2019t know paper could do even in a house like mine. The page had sections I hadn\u2019t seen earlier, or maybe my eyes had not known how to assemble them. It read: Clerks of Interim: Luca Leland (kin), attested. Aegis: North, Adjunct, provisional to prime upon first successful diversion avoidance. Advisory: Choir liaison Alma R.\u2014the surname had fallen through a crack and not been caught; I don\u2019t ask paper for everything. Below that, in a smaller hand that was neither mine nor Alma\u2019s, a line: Note the existence of Sparrow. Do not feed crumbs.\n\nThe doorbell did not ring. It sighed. The building\u2019s lungs announced someone who knew how to step in and out of jurisdiction without making it an affront. The corridor had the smugness of a dog that knows it has done the trick. Luca went to the door and opened it without turning on the screen. A woman stood there wearing a yellow cardigan the color of a legal pad in sunlight, hair gathered into a coil that had once been done in a hurry and then learned to stay. She held a sandwich wrapped in brown paper and a folder the color of sky before storm. Her eyes had smudges under them not because she had forgotten to sleep but because she had remembered not to.\n\n\u201cI like elevators,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do not enjoy it when they like me back too much. May I come in. The birds in your street told me to say please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are more on the nose than we are accustomed to,\u201d Alma said, and the smile that leaked from her was proud and infuriated. \u201cSparrow, if that\u2019s the license you\u2019re paying taxes under, meet the Interim. Interim, this is what happens when a Choir lets its instruments walk around without a case.\u201d\n\nSparrow looked at me and saw all the wrongs and the rights and did not arrange them. She didn\u2019t look at North because she could feel him like you feel a plumb line even if you\u2019re not a builder, and her head moved a fraction in his direction the way plants move at night. She held out the sandwich to Luca because she knows how to meet sisters.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t sign your paper,\u201d she said, and her voice had the rasp of a printer forced to keep working because the office needed four more copies of something it pretended not to care about. \u201cI stamped it. There\u2019s a difference. I am not the murderer. I am the person who wrote the tidy condolence you would have received, with your good pictures and the fund for stunt coordinator training allocations at the bottom to assuage the part of us that can be soothed by a check. I have good hands. You see why we hide.\u201d\n\nLuca took the sandwich because she is a serious person. \u201cYou stamped what, exactly,\u201d she said. \u201cSay it properly. We take dictation.\u201d\n\nSparrow did not flinch at the wax bowl. She touched the seal as if it were a pet. \u201cProvisional diversion,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI signed because the other signatures were inevitable and I preferred our house to be allowed to look inside the box. We didn\u2019t put the box there. We didn\u2019t agree with the box. We like to inspect. You should thank me. You can also put my head on a platter; I have seen it done with smaller crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho sent the man in gray,\u201d I asked. \u201cWho taped the paper on the call sheet and who slipped glass dust into a glove and who slept well after.\u201d\n\nSparrow put the folder on the table and opened it. It contained what people like to call nothing: five receipts with the last lines whited out, three photographs of a rig that had been a different rig three months ago, three copies of the same email with different times stamped on top as the server tried to decide how to line them up, and one small piece of paper cut from something larger with a circle drawn in the center so carefully the pen had not bled. In the circle, someone had written: Weather is a mood. People should be permitted moods. You will be paid for this mood.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find a person,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find a room. The room is a cooperative of men who like import duties paid in trust. They call themselves the Silent Studio when they are being disgusting. They own nothing. They advise horizon lines. You\u2019ve been in rooms like that. Sometimes they are useful. Usually they are where breakfasts go to learn to be dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a name,\u201d Alma said. \u201cWe have a half-dozen names. We have a Consultant of Gray who uses Howell as his Tuesday hat. We have you and your stamp. We have my Anahi\u2019s habit of understanding the part under the law where the law keeps its keys. We will go to their room and we will sing at a pitch that makes their glass nervous. Custodian, either you sleep or you change your shoes. Either way, put the kettle on. Every government worth its salt knows the value of a cup before a war.\u201d\n\nI put the kettle on because the house expected it and because the noise fills the space where fear would otherwise sit and practice. Sparrow took off her cardigan because she is practical and because she understands the temperature in our kitchen is not for everyone. North stood by the window and looked not at the flag but at its shadow on the wall, which is a habit men get when they learn to trust signs cast more than signs flown. Luca got out plates because she will never permit a sandwich to be eaten over a sink like shame. I looked at the page where the Directory had added lines in my absence and traced with my finger the words that made me feel like a verb: Custodian, Witness, Adjunct, Liaison.\n\n\u201cI died,\u201d I said, not to anyone and to everyone, as you do when a truth has to be arranged into the room the way furniture has to be arranged after a party. \u201cAnd now I govern. You built a box for me and I got out. We all did things we will finish repenting for when no one is looking. There is a room where men call themselves a studio. There is a man who calls himself a tool. There is a ghost who calls herself an absence so the people who need her can keep standing. There is a name carved into the bottom of my seal that makes every decision feel like the next chapter in a book someone started on a bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in chapter five,\u201d Luca said briskly, cutting the sandwich like it was a treaty. \u201cIf we survive to chapter eight I will buy a rug.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t ask what chapter eight would be. I poured tea and thought of the way the frost writes itself when the metal remembers being ore. Sparrow smiled like a printer given good paper. Alma took the first cup because she likes to set the tone. North stood very close to the line the shadow of the flag made and watched it move with the concentration a man reserves for fires. Somewhere outside a siren declared itself useful and then decided not to come down our street. It understood chalk. You could tell.We ate Sparrow\u2019s sandwich with the gravity of sacrament because it is good policy to fortify yourself before walking into rooms that like to pretend you\u2019re not a person. The bread had seeds that got into our teeth and made us look like we were trying to germinate opinions, and Sparrow nodded at our chewing the way a clerk nods at a stamp behaving on damp paper. She had brought the folder because folders are how her kind say I love you, and she watched the way our hands moved over it the way birders watch wind. Alma unfolded a city schedule out of nowhere and found a margin where time could be borrowed; she said, in the tone of a conductor pretending she is only a passenger, that we would hold our hearing somewhere that understood being between. We picked the freight elevator bank at the old municipal annex because it is the place where floors consider one another, where scooters pause, and where heat from stories above meets cold from stories below and has to shake hands.\n\nDax\u2019s bullet list arrived like hail in my phone: keep the cup; do not educate; offer reassurance; name a child who will benefit; do not say \u2018murder\u2019 on morning TV; say \u2018interruption\u2019; avoid calling anyone a consortium; if you must, say \u2018pool\u2019; do not invent a new anthem on live broadcast; if you must sing, hum. He had framed a tiny box of competence for me to carry into the field of cameras, and I took it because carrying something small convinces a lens you\u2019re not armed. Carlotta texted me a string of chalices and a snowman and a video where she had drawn a mouth on the mirror with lipstick and then erased it with her thumb; the mirror sighed; it was the opposite of cathartic; it was useful. Sparrow said she would not attend television because televisions and sparrows have an old argument about who invented flicker, and she preferred to spend the hour riding elevators to see which ones prayed when they were empty.\n\nWe went to the daytime show with our flag folded inside Luca\u2019s tote because flags in bags behave the way cats behave: insouciant and sure that a room will adjust to their existence. North wore a jacket that forgot to announce itself; he walked half a pace behind and half a breath to the left, and the producer re-labeled him as crew without knowing why. The host had the hair of a person who had learned to be lit from inside and the smile of a person accustomed to passing an open window at the moment the sunset remembers itself; she pressed my fingers like a vote and told me her mother made tea when the country broke and called it repair. I held the mug they gave me like a treaty freshly signed; the prop department preferred matte to gloss, but the steam still rose and threaded my face without disturbing itself on my skin. The camera tried very hard to blink and could not, so I did the kindness of blinking for both of us.\n\n\u201cYou raised a flag,\u201d the host said, voice wrapping itself around the word as if it were fragile and not a spear. \u201cCongratulations. What does the Interim govern.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreath,\u201d I said, and Dax\u2019s ghost ran his hands through his hair, but sometimes a cup makes you brave. \u201cThe space after decision and before action. The hallways we forget to sweep. The silence between a door\u2019s click and the footsteps turning away. We collect statements from anyone who has ever been told to wait in the lounge and be patient. We forgive taxes upon evidence of sincerity. We have an anthem that is a hush.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like poetry,\u201d she said, and the producer smiled with all his teeth because he likes poetry when it behaves like content.\n\n\u201cPoetry is what law calls itself when it eats its vegetables,\u201d I said, and her laugh was honest, which is a kind you don\u2019t waste. I said \u2018interruption\u2019 the way Dax had asked and did not say \u2018murder\u2019 because some nouns deserve rooms that can lock, and I kept my promise to avoid \u2018consortium\u2019 and instead said \u2018pool,\u2019 and every swimmer in the city looked up at the vent and thought of the sound chlorine makes in the nose. I said, \u201cIf you see our flag, you are under our protection for the length of a breath,\u201d and the sound engineer noted the way the room softened and turned his levels up a hair so the hush wouldn\u2019t eat the show.\n\nHowell tested us during the cooking segment, because men who build rooms enjoy doing it while butter melts; butter is persuasive, and he respects a rival. The studio lights cooled in a synchronized apology, and the induction burners blinked like owls, and the audience did that drawn-in inhale people do when they smell a storm through brick. The air pressed down like a hand that had forgotten to be gentle, and the teleprompter wrote the word wait twice as if to scold itself. North moved before I could move because his job is to get to the verb before the noun goes missing; he stepped forward into the space where sound was failing and put his palm on the cement floor as if it were a creature with a back that needed patting. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry,\u201d he said to the building, quiet enough the microphones didn\u2019t consent to carry it. \u201cWe brought weather without papers. We are here with permission. We will leave a copy on your loading dock.\u201d\n\nThe lights blinked like men told a joke in a dialect they nearly understood, and the burners exhaled, and the producer wrote down the phrase permission and apology on his hand because he is not a fool and knows when he is being handed copy that will taste good on late news. The audience applauded because applause is what humans do when they survive a draft they cannot name. The host said, \u201cWe all feel better,\u201d which is the kind of lie necessary to keep a country from dissolving on air, and later she whispered, \u201cI felt something stand down,\u201d and I awarded North in my head a stripe I had no authority to award. By the time we reached the sidewalk he had a text on the inside of his retinas that read: Adjunct advanced to Prime upon successful avoidance of a forced pause; please present for imprint. He held out his hand for Alma like a boy asking to cross the road, and Alma put the Choir\u2019s weight on his knuckles with a nod that was not sentimental and not indifferent but a record.\n\nWe held the Interim\u2019s first hearing between floors six and seven of the annex because six believes in the past and seven thinks it invented the future; it is useful to keep both wrong in the same room. Saffron brought cones because cones are the way cities say do not, but she arranged them like pews because she likes to see how people sit when they are asked to witness. The elevator doors agreed to stay open for the length of a song if we promised to hum, and we did, softly, a shade lower than comfortable so the cables could listen without having to translate. The call went out the old way and the new: paper on lampposts, posts on feeds, a woman with a bird voice telling her three most stubborn friends; the people who came were as reliable as plumbing: a union man who knew the price of bolts, a child with a cardboard crown, a woman who had lit candles in more churches than she believed in, Brazos with rope burns on his soul, Jonah wearing his posture like a confession, Kincaid in an outfit that would photograph well under fluorescents, Howell not invited and very much there at the edge because lines tempt him.\n\nLuca read the writ we had cooked the way poor people cook bones: long and patient until the noun gave itself up. We called it the Writ of Unclosure because sometimes you have to name the opposite of what the world keeps doing until it gets bored and stops. It said: No provisional diversion of heat, voice, or likeness shall be applied to a person within the Interim\u2019s jurisdiction without immediate public notice in a room with at least two doors and wind passing through. It said: All tags bearing the half-star must be background-sung and entered into Minutes audible to any person with a throat. It said: Apologies are keys; excuses are locks; choose accordingly. It said: Violators will be asked to carry a bowl until they drop it from fatigue and then be required to pick up what they spilled with their hands. The crowd hummed, not because they liked rules but because there is comfort in knowing where the stairs are when the building pretends to be a hill.\n\nWe took testimony because testimony is how you force a room to agree it has ears. Carlotta spoke first, saying the mirror had learned new handwriting and that she had a memory of my temperature like a dress you outgrow and refuse to give away. The teacher with the hands said, \u201cYou are not the first child to come back colder,\u201d and her voice put a shawl on every shoulder without permission and everyone let her because she had earned it by grading papers with kindness. Brazos told the story as if he were setting a rig, parts and timings and knots and everything, and when he got to the laminate he said the word laminate like a curse he was humbly borrowing for an occasion he hoped would not be repeated. Sparrow spoke so softly the elevator cables had to lean in; she said her stamp had been used as a splint, not as a knife, and that she was prepared to carry bowls for a year if that would keep another girl\u2019s heat from getting filed. Jonah talked about rooms that give you a line and take your name, and he kept not saying sorry because the thing he was sorry for was being asked to be useful in the worst way and he had done it.\n\nKincaid entered her minutes with the self-respect of a ledger that has learned to blush; she put Weather at the mercy of the Interim for cases bearing the circle, and she said publicly what men like her say privately when they fear they might be asked to defend a budget, which is: we need to be watched to deserve our windows. Howell offered commentary the way a museum offers placards beside stolen art; he said the Silent Studio was a misnomer and that silence is seldom silent when you press your ear to it; he called his collective a room that processes anxieties into policy, and the union man, who had been quiet until then, said, \u201cWe already have a word for that room. It\u2019s called a bar,\u201d and everyone laughed because the only way to keep a monster from learning your smell is to laugh at yourself loudly in a public place.\n\nThen Howell did what men who build rooms cannot help but do when challenged; he tried to close us. It was not dramatic; drama is for people who sell show. The air began to settle as if tired and the elevator\u2013which had agreed to be a chapel\u2013made a small mechanical decision that frightened me: it twitched toward shut. The cables tensed like tired muscle, and the doors inched as if drawn by a pen dragged by a hand that did not intend to write but did not want to drop the pen. People glanced sideways the way creatures do when they smell the ocean change its mind. North stood in the doorway with his palm up and did not push; he apologized, and he did it in a dialect doors understand.\n\n\u201cWe trespassed,\u201d he said, and in his voice lived a hundred hall monitors learned from a hundred buildings. \u201cWe assumed our hum was sufficient; we did not ask your bolts. If you let us finish our song we will wipe the fingerprints from your glass and oil the places people forget to oil because they are high and require a ladder. We brought wax. We brought a stamp. We will leave you a copy of our apology if you need to look at it later when your gears wake at three in the morning and ask if they were rude.\u201d\n\nThe elevator sighed with relief because it had been given an avenue of retreat that did not require a fight; the doors kissed the cones and then opened again, not in surrender but in amendment. Alma\u2019s mouth softened at the corners because she is not sentimental about men but she is sentimental about language, and that was language behaving. The crowd hummed without being told to, and I felt the little burr of Howell\u2019s gift for interruption slide off my skin the way a zipper unhooks when the dress finally agrees you have hips. North looked at me levelly and for the first time since the tin and the frost and the bathroom mirror we nodded at one another like equals in a storm.\n\nWe passed the Writ because we decided to pass it and because no one stopped us and because, in secret bureaucracies, that is often the only difference between law and hobby. The wax made a respectable puddle on the frame of the door, and the half-star printed clean on brushed steel as if steel had been hoping all day for something as stupid and earnest as a mark to wear. Saffron cried in that particular way security personnel cry, a quick wetness and an upright neck, and then pretended it was allergies and told us to keep moving because the building does not like to be crowded long. Jonah wiped his eyes with his sleeve and muttered something about dust, which was not untrue, and Brazos said, \u201cI\u2019ll carry bowls for a week if it means I never have to watch a room get smug again.\u201d\n\nAfter, we came down to the lobby where the receptionist had given herself a promotion to usher and liked it. The city had noticed in the way cities do: someone had put our seal on a T-shirt and the proceeds would go to the stunt coordinator fund Sparrow had imagined, someone had put the flag on a cake and the frosting line had wobbled precisely where the wind would; someone had drawn the word Interim on a wall and put a chair beneath it because words need places to sit. Dax texted me: you were good on air, you were righteous in the annex, remember to say yes to late-night because I have a mortgage, and also tell the boy with the not a phase sweatshirt he has better posture than Jonah. I texted back a photo of a spoon with wax on it and he answered with a stack of coins and a heart. It will never stop being strange to me that hearts make sense in line drawings when the actual muscle is a messy miracle.\n\nWe did not get the consolation of a culprit with a hat pulled low and a bad attitude. We got office furniture. The Silent Studio\u2019s room was summoned, as promised, by paperwork; it arranged itself in a sub-basement that had never been given a number because numbers make rooms think they can join committees, and this room liked being committee-proof. We entered not as a raid but as a delegation, which is to say we carried ourselves like people who have things to write down and do not mind waiting while the light finds a way to flatter us. The men at the table had faces built by human resources and hands that had gotten soft by holding long pens. A woman with a face like a pocketknife sat with them without being of them, and I wondered which of us had learned more about knives today and decided to file it under later.\n\n\u201cCustodian,\u201d said the chair who had elected himself. \u201cWe are concerned by your writ. It introduces wind into processes that benefit from sealed containers.\u201d He smiled at me the way men smile at babies offered good whiskey, and I smiled back the way women smile at men who think they invented grain. Howell sat at the far end, not absent and not present, the way a shadow sits in a tree and makes birds reconsider.\n\n\u201cYour sealed containers killed me,\u201d I said, and Luca made a soft sound because there is no way to say that sentence without scaring your sister. \u201cYou will ask me for proof and I will offer you the witness of my kitchen. You will tell me kitchens are unreliable. I will tell you we are not here to cave your logic in; we are here to introduce windows you do not get to frost. You called yourselves a studio and took no actors into your confidence. You will change your sign.\u201d\n\nThe pocketknife woman looked pleased because she likes a new sign the way other people like shoes. The chair man gestured at a whiteboard so clean it bragged. \u201cWe manage anxieties. We do not break bones. If a bone broke it was an accident of architecture, and we regret it while noting the efficiency of our regret. Who among you will confess to exemption from the market in feelings. We sell clarity. We do not sell death.\u201d\n\nKincaid made a noise like a ledger clearing its throat. She placed a stack of paper on the table and patted it the way you pat a child you have decided to let make a mistake. \u201cYou purchase minutes from Weather,\u201d she said. \u201cYou resell calm as if it were salt and not the air in a room with many doors. You cannot continue to run your margins through other people\u2019s heat without submitting your invoices to a jurisdiction.\u201d She looked at me and the look said, I am enjoying being righteous, let me be petty for three lines, and I nodded because sometimes petty is an antiseptic. \u201cWe recognize Interim. Do you.\u201d\n\nThey had a meeting in front of us while we watched because that is how men like to assert power: by performing a closed session open. They did not use a language I didn\u2019t understand; they used tone, which is older and worse. They said contingency and compliance and we are fiduciaries, and Jonah\u2019s face closed down because he has had enough of being narrated by men who are trying not to sweat. Sparrow stood behind me with one finger on the back of my elbow and traced circles like moth flights; she was drawing air through me to remind me I had it. Alma waited until the third time they said inevitable, then began to hum under her breath, and though the pitch was low I felt fillings consider moving, and the chair\u2019s pen began to leak a little because ink knows when the choir is bored.\n\n\u201cThis is what we will do,\u201d I said, not because I was finished being angry but because governance is what you do instead of combustion when you have a flag. \u201cYou will read the writ as if it had teeth because it does. You will send pre-notification to the Interim of any attempt to apply a tag bearing the half-star within a hallway, studio, road, hospital, courthouse, classroom, or kitchen in this city and any city that opens its windows to our flag. You will cease referring to yourselves as a studio in writing because that word belongs to people who sweat under lights. You will pick a name that suits you. You will accept this bowl.\u201d I put the wax bowl on the table and saw how three men flinched because they understood the spell of bowls if not the language, and I pushed it toward the chair. \u201cYou will carry it everywhere for a week. When you put it down, you will remember it. That remembering is the point.\u201d\n\nThe pocketknife woman smiled because she likes homework. The chair wrinkled his nose because bowls are below him and that is his tragedy. Howell, who had not spoken, lifted one hand from his knee as if weighing wind and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a fair price for being permitted to keep a job that should never have existed,\u201d and the room heard him because he had finally chosen to be interesting. The chair drafted a memo in his head and sent it to everyone who could approve his salary; he said, \u201cWe have notes,\u201d and I said, \u201cWe have ink,\u201d and Sparrow\u2019s finger moved from circles to a straight line up my arm because we were done here.\n\nOutside, the air didn\u2019t forgive us because air doesn\u2019t; it accepts you if you don\u2019t lie. We stood under a sky that could have passed for honest and a drone tilted its face toward our seal and then away because we had become background, which is the goal of every government that wants to last long enough to create a museum about itself. North bent without ceremony and drew a small chalk line across the threshold to the sub-basement because some rooms require leashing, and then he breathed out and the chalk flared cold for a second that tasted like a lake in early spring. He was pale in the way good work makes a person pale, and I made him eat the last of the sandwich we had saved not because he needed food but because rituals should be protected from hunger.\n\nAt home the Directory had grown another page like a careful fungus. It recorded our hearing not with adjectives but with lines that remembered feet: Attending; Speaking; Resolutions; Objections; The Comedic Interventions of the Union; The Elevation of Adjunct to Prime: North, attested; The First Application of the Writ of Unclosure: successful. It had left a margin for dissent and someone had already written in tiny letters: stairs are not always better than ramps, which was the kind of dissent I like because it assumes we both want to get to the same place with grace. The flag in the window had learned the day\u2019s wind and rested like a creature that has run and been loved.\n\nLuca went to the sink and washed the wax bowl with a gentleness that would have forgiven a spoon if it had been cruel earlier. Sparrow sat on the floor because chairs make her nervous and put her cardigan on the back of a chair anyway because symbols are for everyone. Alma answered three messages from women whose names are never in the paper and then leaned against the counter with her head tilted back and closed her eyes without sleeping; she doesn\u2019t need to sleep to restore, she needs to be held up by walls that know her weight. North sat at the table and examined his card, which had changed while we were in the elevator; the letters had thickened, and the word Adjunct had learned its own past and settled into Prime with the relief of a shoe that fits.\n\nI stood at the window and watched our flag breathe, and for a moment the air inside my chest matched it. The city was busy not saying our name because saying a new government\u2019s name too often is a way of trying to own it. That was fine. We had been made to be background, and background is what you hold so the picture can be looked at without falling apart. My phone buzzed. It was a message from an unknown number with no signature, only a picture of a door with a small circle drawn on it so carefully the ink had not bled, and underneath the circle, a note: I did not sign. I watched. I will speak. The photo had been taken in a stairwell and the hand that had taken it had not trembled.\n\nWe were not done. Thursday had not been invented yet for this week. Howell would build rooms with the kind of persistence that made men in the old stories kings until a horse broke a leg, and Kincaid would send us minutes like a plea for a life she didn\u2019t exactly want to renounce but wanted to see in better light. Sparrow would find an elevator that got religious at noon and coax it into being a courthouse. Alma would go find the corner of the city where Anahi had disappeared herself and speak to its plumbing until the pipes answered. Dax would book me on late-night and ask me to perform warmth, and I would, because warmth is a skill and not a temperature. Luca would paint a small flag in the bottom corner of our kitchen window and forget about it until spring, when the sun found it and made it look like an invitation.\n\nThat night I dreamed no car and no flip and no fire. I dreamed a hallway that refused to pick a floor and a woman with a yellow cardigan who sorted paper into three piles labeled soon, later, never, and then fed the never to a bird who went out the window and came back with a string in its beak. In the dream, I took the string and tied it to my wrist and to North\u2019s and to Luca\u2019s and to Alma\u2019s, and when the building tilted we tilted together and did not fall. I woke to a city that had not been improved by our writ and had not been harmed by it either, which is also victory if you\u2019ve ever sat on a curb and watched people learn to take turns. On the kitchen counter the wax tin had caved a little at one edge like a smile that got away from itself, and the seal sat where I had left it, heavy and honest and ready to be used again. The air in the apartment had chosen to be friendly. It is a choice. We make it every time.Morning learned my name without needing to see my face. It sat on the windowsill and looked at the flag until the fabric agreed to lift with a little ceremony, as if stretching could be a national act. Coffee did the same thing it always does, which is to say it remembered to be bitter and then forgave itself. The Directory had grown not by page but by weight; I could feel it in the way the table learned a new note. On the open leaf, no longer pretending it had opened itself by chance, a line waited with the calm of a summons: Aegis Pairing: imprint pending; venue assigned, 10:30; bring your seal and your breath. Alma had texted me the location before I could tell the paper I was coming; she always plays the conductor, even when the train insists it is self-driving. North knocked once and then didn\u2019t knock again, which is how you treat a house you intend to protect. When I opened the door he was where knocks go to rest, hands empty in a way that made the hallway remember its job. \u201cIt will smell like lightning,\u201d he said, and when I laughed, the laugh landed properly on the floor instead of turning into a draft.\n\nThe imprint happened in the place where the city keeps its humming. Substation P-9 had a fence that apologized for being necessary and a gate that had learned to swing without squealing because maintenance men unlearned superstition slower than other men and oiled kindness into hinges. Inside, a woman in a jacket that might once have been a uniform but had since become a skin stood with a clipboard and a scar that believed in the usefulness of straight lines. She introduced herself as Marshal Corbyn and she shook my hand with a friendliness that did not require warmth. The platform they had set up was not a dais and not an altar; it was the kind of table engineers trust, thick wood gone smooth from hands and math. There were tools you could name and tools you couldn\u2019t, and in the middle a plate of tempered glass laid over a disc of hammered copper like a compromise that had learned to last. Corbyn tapped the copper with a fingernail and the sound it made was older than bureaucracy. \u201cWe don\u2019t do blood,\u201d she said, as if someone had asked and been rebuked by the weather. \u201cWe do promises, and we trap a breath when it still thinks it is free, and we put a little salt on it because the body likes to be reminded it is not theory.\u201d\n\nWe went through the sentences as if we had rehearsed, which we had not, except in the way good sentences rehearse themselves in a human being who has been taught to be careful. North said, \u201cI will stand where she refuses to step without permission,\u201d and the plate we were touching registered his voice as a temperature change, a quick exhale of heat that left a ring no eye would see and every meter would. I said, \u201cI will ask before I enter rooms that behave like animals,\u201d and I watched the frost gather under my palm in handwriting that had begun to look like mine instead of like whoever had been practicing in my bathroom mirror. Corbyn laid a square of gauze over our hands with her mouth soft on the word gauze, because some officers love fabric like surgeons do. She sprinkled salt that tasted of the sea you get in storms and rocks, and she set the seal in the center with the good weight of someone who enjoys heavy things because they refuse to pretend. \u201cYou are not each other\u2019s weapons,\u201d she said, and the power lines above us hummed their assent. \u201cYou are not each other\u2019s excuses. You are each other\u2019s proof.\u201d\n\nThe glass caught our breath and made a sound like a hard candy cracking, and the copper received it as if it had been waiting at this table since the city first decided to put wires on its shoulders. The seal pressed half-star into the gauze with a dignity the wax at home could only dream of, and when Corbyn lifted it, the fabric kept a shimmer that was not quite light. North\u2019s card changed itself in his pocket because authority likes to be dramatic when no one is watching; when he brought it out, the letters had acquired a refraction, a humility that pretends to be vanity, and the word Adjunct had squared its shoulders into Prime as if it had done push-ups. They gave me nothing physical because everything they intended to give was already in the air, but the Directory added a paragraph by the time we drove back, lines about jurisdiction adjacency and two sigils that had not been on my eyes before and now would be forever: a little ladder and a small bowl. \u201cLadder means escalation that is allowed,\u201d Corbyn said, a smile in her voice that made the hum of the substation flirt with being a song. \u201cBowl means apology you carry on purpose. You\u2019ll need both. People without ladders throw stones. People without bowls break their teeth on wind.\u201d\n\nWe celebrated by not telling anyone, which is a way of keeping precious things from burning off in the sun. On the way out, a man in a hard hat with his name stitched on in gray thread lifted two fingers to North in the old salute men used when they had to make respect travel across a noisy room. He gave me a nod he would have given a weather vane that had done its work in an honest storm. In the car, Alma called to say she had already got the minutes of our imprint from a clerk who claimed to have dreamed them, which is how information travels between rooms when everyone pretends their fences are decorative. She added, lightly, that my inbox contained six invitations to governance group chats in which people with opinions about the constitution of tiny places shared photos of their flags in flattering light; the Perpetual Lunch had gone lowercase and was calling itself per-lunch; the Duchy of Bridges sent a biceps emoji; the President of Grafton-on-Courts sent a recipe for stew with a footnote about how to keep small nations from sticking to the bottom of the pot. \u201cDon\u2019t reply until you\u2019ve eaten something that grew in dirt,\u201d Alma said. \u201cIt will help.\u201d\n\nSparrow had spent the morning riding elevators as if they were horses that occasionally had theology. She met us at the municipal annex with her cardigan tied around her waist and a notebook full of small circles that had not bled. \u201cThe one between eight and nine says Hail Mary when the cable touches,\u201d she said, without irony and without religion, as if the elevator were allowed to make friends. \u201cThe one by the loading bay likes to hold breath for the length of a commercial. The service car in the west wing stops to pray on twelve because twelve isn\u2019t there on the buttons and no one likes to be left off a list.\u201d She took us to a door that didn\u2019t know it was a door because for decades it had been telling itself it was a wall, and she knocked with two knuckles the way clerks knock when they are introducing a letter to a desk. The space beyond smelled like lemon and paper and an old pencil eaten down past the dignity of its eraser.\n\nAnahi was present and absent in a tidy way that left dignity in the room. There was a packet of papers bound with twine and a sovereign stapler that stapled nothing to air and two paper clips bent into swans. There was a map taped inside the cabinet that listed Nothing To See Here where anyone else would have listed the plan for Tuesday. Someone had written, in a hand that made beauty look inevitable, Do not confuse urgency with importance; bend minutes toward the stairs if the hallway lies. Sparrow wanted to touch the note and didn\u2019t. She folded her hands instead and whispered without whispering, \u201cShe isn\u2019t gone so much as parallel.\u201d Her voice made parallel sound like a country a person goes to for treatment when cancer decides to be feral. Alma stood in the doorway like a hinge and said nothing, which is how grief behaves when it is working.\n\nDax got me booked on a late-night that had grown tender in its old age. The set was a living room pretending to be a stage and the host had the eyes of a dog who had learned to accept applause as a kind of petting. He shook my hand and stole a joke about bowls and then gave it back to me to deliver because he is a gentleman thief when his wife watches. North did what North does and became part of the furniture that knows how to brace a room. I said the things you say when a nation is not yet a costume and cannot be tried on by people who prefer clothing to commitment. I said we had written a writ that made wind audible and that we had placed a stamp on an elevator door because buildings get lonely. The host laughed in the place where people laugh when you let them relax, and then he looked up at an imaginary balcony and spoke to his mother, as he always does, because she died when the show was new and he kept her in the rafters. \u201cShe likes you,\u201d he said to me, gently, and the camera leaned in to see my eyes, which is rude, and I let it because it pays the crew.\n\nWednesday pretended to be Tuesday until Howell proved he had a watch. He sent the message on cheap paper that had been expensive when he was young, and he wrote with a pen that liked to behave like a fountain when given a napkin. The note had been left on my mat under the door like a present from a neighbor who leaves zucchini in summer, and my stomach recognized the handwriting before my eyes did. DUSK, he wrote, as if dusk were punctual. 101, under the new bridge where the old one looks up at it. Bring the bowl. Bring the man who apologizes to doors. If you want hands, I will give you the ones that did it. If you want a room, I will give you an audience. If you want a version, I will make one.\n\nWe didn\u2019t take all of us because drama doesn\u2019t like a crowd unless it has bought extra chairs. Brazos came because his rope-work had snagged on that place and would not come free. Saffron came because she had decided protection was her vocation and not her wage, and because the city had given her a key in the shape of authority and she liked to try locks. Alma came because she would and because you don\u2019t send your girls to a bridge with a man who renames himself and not stand at the edge of the light. Sparrow stayed with Luca and the box of papers because the world needs two kinds of fighters and kitchens are as violent as highways when you put truth on plates. The flag came as a pin on my lapel and as a shadow on my breath, and it was enough.\n\nThe 101 had been repaired in a way that pretended to be seamless. The new bridge had a smooth young spine and the old one lay below it like an ancestor. Every city in this country has a place where the new sits on the old and the wind sits on both and tells them to get along. Howell stood where sound goes to collect itself and he looked like a clerk again because clerks are what evil uses when it wants to keep its fingerprints clean. He had three people with him and all of them wore a color that refuses to photograph properly, the gray that only a certain grade of suit can manage, and even then only if the wearer likes the smell of copy machines. He introduced them with the economy of a man who has learned that names are ways in. \u201cGrey,\u201d he said for one, and that one inclined his head because anonymity had been his job and his talent. \u201cGlass,\u201d he said for another, and this one\u2019s hands had scars like punctuation from someone else\u2019s knife. \u201cLedger,\u201d he said for the third, and she wore her hair in a tight coil like a woman who expects to be called a name and would prefer it to be correct.\n\n\u201cYou promised hands,\u201d I said, and I saw how Howell relished consistency. He set a table with it and invited himself to dinner.\n\nGrey stepped forward and took off his glove and then put it back on, which is the motion men make when they want you to notice that they own their hands twice. \u201cI carried the powder,\u201d he said, flat, the way men speak when they expect forgiveness to be a chop they can buy on the cheap cut of the cow. \u201cI sealed the rig. I brought a note the crew would swallow without chewing because the font looked familiar. I took a call and then pretended my ear had lost the number. I was paid to reduce heat. I did that. Your person stopped being heat and started being a record. It is not my fault the record cut itself loose and walked.\u201d\n\nGlass moved his wrists in the air with the memory of heat on them and shook off something that would bother him for the rest of his life. \u201cI polished the chamber,\u201d he said, and the words made Brazos\u2019s hands ball because the idea of a chamber polished makes men who love engines think of slaughterhouses. \u201cI like clean rooms. I like to make sure cracks don\u2019t get away from me. They told me this would make the room quiet during the dangerous part. They said the quiet would keep the blood in one place. I believed them because I prefer to see what I am supposed to be looking at. If you want a confession, I have the receipts for the gloves.\u201d\n\nLedger met my eyes and did me the respect of not flinching. \u201cI ran the numbers,\u201d she said, and the wind liked her for her honesty because it is a ledger too in its way. \u201cI saw that purchasing minutes from Weather would lower legal exposure to three suits and two funerals instead of nine and a class action. I saw the bowl of money and I saw the staircase of precedent and I signed the form to put the bowl at the top instead of at the bottom. The math was elegant. The math killed you. I am prepared to carry bowls until I hate soup.\u201d\n\nIf I had been someone else, I might have thought I had my murderer. If I had been someone the city had not made into a place between, I might have accepted the relief of names like Grey and Glass and Ledger and stored them where forgiveness or fury can go when they need a bed. But Howell had promised hands and had offered me a room, and when men like him are generous it is because the generous thing distracts from the place generosity has learned to keep its knives. \u201cWho told you to be elegant,\u201d I said, and I did not mean whose voice and I did not mean whose check. I meant the grammar. I meant the habit. I meant the way a culture can talk a person into believing that killing is a type of tidying.\n\nHowell showed me his teeth without malice. \u201cLanguage did,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are a woman famously good at saying things other people wrote until they sound like your own apologies. You know what language can make a hand do. If you want the man who delivered the order, I can call him and he will arrive in a car that is too clean, and he will be made of lacquer and fear and gentlemen\u2019s clubs, and when he says sorry you will smell his father. It will not satisfy you. If you want the board member who authorized the contingency fund, I will give you a list of surnames whose first letters can be rearranged into the word harbor, and you will pick one, and he will call his lawyer, and the lawyer will say my client did not intend, and the judge will say intent is slippery, and you will go home with the kind of justice that ruins lunch. If you want a rule, you have made one. If you want a sentence, you will write it.\u201d\n\nWe had brought the bowl because men like Howell inherit an allergy to bowls and I wanted to watch him itch. Saffron held it like an emblem and not like a weapon because she is not confused about what carries what. North set it on the asphalt and the bowl recognized ground and became heavy the way obligations do when you place them where they belong. Brazos, to his credit, did not throw it at anyone, which is how I know he is the man I thought he was. I picked it up and pressed the wax with the seal until the impression learned the lines in this place, and then I handed the bowl to Grey. He took it because the choreography of such moments has trained even men who deface the stage to accept props. \u201cCarry it for a week,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen you think you\u2019ve earned the right to set it down, count one hundred breaths and then ask the nearest child if you\u2019re done. If you drop it, don\u2019t buy another. Fix it with your hands. If someone asks you what it is, tell them it is the temperature you owe.\u201d\n\nGrey accepted like a person accepts medicine in a clinic with a plastic fern: polite, suspicious, already composing a story where the dose is half. Glass took a smaller bowl because even sin has proportions, and Ledger took no bowl because numbers have always preferred to write punishments for themselves; she wrote on her palm instead, a column of tally marks she would regret and add to and then laugh at when she was alone. Howell watched and did an old-fashioned thing I hadn\u2019t seen in a while: he inclined his head to a decision as if bowing could keep him from being caught by it. He tried to close us, because it is his trick and because you can\u2019t ask a scorpion not to know its tail. The air thickened like soup left too long on the stove and every sound tried to put on socks and go to bed. It would have worked on the person I was before a glass plate trapped my breath under my own hand and asked it to learn to sing.\n\nNorth said sorry to the bridge and to the old bridge under it and to the patch of asphalt that thinks it is tired. I spoke to Howell with the grammar of ladders because it was the one the day had given me. \u201cWe are in a place with more than one exit,\u201d I said, and that fact made the thickening thin, because exits like to be acknowledged. \u201cPermission,\u201d I said, and the chalk line that North had drawn under our feet on the way in flared briefly like a smirk. \u201cApology,\u201d I said, and the bowl in Grey\u2019s hands went heavier and turned being carried into a thing like prayer. The closure slid away from us without having the dignity to admit it had been tried, and Howell\u2019s cheek twitched with the annoyance of a man whose favorite trick has been named aloud on television and therefore lost.\n\n\u201cWe could arrest them,\u201d Saffron said, and for a second I loved her with a patriotic fervor reserved for people who look at a wrench and see a lever. \u201cNot because it sticks in court, but because it sticks in feeds. We need to show people that bowls aren\u2019t our only ceremony.\u201d Alma made a small sound, which is how she swears when the room has children in it. The idea of taking Grey by the wrist and leading him into a building with fluorescent lights and gum under the benches had a human thrill, like eating bad candy and not paying for it. The thrill would evaporate the second a man in a suit wrote a sentence about intent on paper that smells like eucalyptus, and then all we\u2019d have is a headline and a smarting wrist.\n\n\u201cTake their room,\u201d I said to Howell, because governance is theft when you do it well and politely. \u201cIt can\u2019t call itself a studio. It can call itself a lounge if it likes the sound of furniture. It cannot buy minutes without a throat in the room. It cannot pour heat into a ledger without the ledger blushing, and if your sign ever shows the half-star, the circle must go through our desk. When it doesn\u2019t, we will hum at your windows until your interns confess their mothers\u2019 names.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the space between my shoulder and my ear like a man deciding if he could fit a mark there and had to admit he could not. He nodded again because the nod cost him less than pretending to be stubborn. \u201cThursday,\u201d he said, and the word had stopped being a promise and become an appointment with the weather. \u201cYour murderer is a habit. Your habit is to agree to speed when you are already falling. You will find a single throat to put it in because courts love throats. It will be a clever throat. It will not feel like a victory. If you want one of those, you will have to invent it.\u201d\n\nWe left the bridge with no sirens because drama had already been paid for elsewhere. Brazos, who has trained men to fall and survive without any of us calling it salvation, walked beside Grey and taught him how to carry a bowl in a crosswind. Saffron texted a cousin who worked in a building where signatures like to learn flamenco and told her to watch for bowl-bearing men walking like they had ulcers. Alma stood by the edge of sun and shade and checked the names in her pocket and revised which pockets were now allowed to hold which names. North and I walked the chalk line back to the car and treated it like a parade, because you have to model what you want the world to do with your simple lines. The flag on my lapel waited until the door closed and then fluttered once in relief.\n\nBack at the apartment, the Directory had added a function I didn\u2019t know it had. The margins had become a ribbon of indexes, and under W it listed Weather, Witnesses, and Writ of Unclosure, and under S it listed Sparrow, Stills, and Silent Studio, and the last had a line: formerly a room; renamed: Lounge of Contingencies; current status: watched. Sparrow had found her way to my kitchen without asking the house first because the house liked her and because she had, at some point, fed its elevator a pep talk. She placed on the table a small object that looked like a doorbell poetically remade; it had no wires and a button the color of things that mean go. \u201cAnahi builds these for rooms that forget to talk,\u201d she said, touching the button with the care people reserve for the first freckle on a baby. \u201cIf a door is determined to be a mouth, you give it something to bite that won\u2019t scream. Press this when the closure tries to pretend it doesn\u2019t understand you. It will remind the threshold that it\u2019s not a lid.\u201d\n\nLuca, who had been painting at the window because she refuses to let governance steal all her verbs, turned with a brush in her hand and asked, with the directness she keeps chained and lets loose at the right times, whether we were done looking for the balloon labeled murderer and had remembered to look under our own skirts for the string. We stared at her like well-meaning idiots and she grinned with the fond malice siblings learn when they know you won\u2019t leave just because they were right. \u201cSpeed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all sold speed. You sold it. Dax sold it. The network sold it. Brazos sold it with math and then took the money back and sold safety with thicker math. Howell sells pauses as a luxury. Ledger sold the price of slow as an expense. The murder is a market. If you want to fry a person instead of a habit, call Studio Counsel by his first name and tell him you\u2019re sorry you made him lie in emails. He\u2019ll confess in a paragraph. If you want to do your job, write a law about speed.\u201d\n\nWriting laws in kitchens is the oldest trick in the book and I recommend it if you are ever given a country by surprise. We wrote a draft of a law and called it the Speed Limit because euphemism is another kind of bowl and we wanted people to be able to lift it. It said: No escalation shall be signed without the signature of the person whose heat will be contained. It said: Hours will be paid in full even if minutes are borrowed; you cannot dock a worker for weather. It said: All footage taken in the hour around a person\u2019s death shall be treated as a body and not as a product; it will be named and stored and not edited until breath has had time to lint the corners of the room with patience. It said: Networks that weaponize urgency will be taxed in air; we will put flags in their lobbies that hum certain keys until their editors suggest better verbs. Sparrow looked at our drafts and added a note in the margin in a handwriting that would make a judge check her glasses: If this law passes, it must pass by humming and not by vote, which is to say the halls must learn it; committees that own the elevators must agree to carry it. Alma smiled and did not hide it because this was her heaven: the afterlife of a rule where it stays busy.\n\nWe went to bed thinking legislation might be the kiss that wakes our city, which is a thing people think when they have not yet read the comments. By morning, Howell proved he reads faster than my fans and changed the terrain in the most obvious way: a man who had never been photographed unposed delivered to us in a cardboard envelope a document with a signature at the bottom and a date that made the paper smell of hot machines. Studio Counsel had signed his name to an escalation notice drafted on a day the network had been closed for a holiday. The name was long and grim and the handwriting legible. The post-it attached to the top belonged to Kincaid because the ink had a hurry to it. It read: He got in front of the story and then threw himself into it. He will resign before anyone can obscure anything. He is tired. Bring a bowl.\n\nWe took a bowl because that is how the Interim tells a person they have to carry their answer around until the weight educates their posture. We met Counsel in a room the building had set aside as a lounge for men whose rings had begun to account for their lives, and he looked like a man who had lost the ability to pretend he enjoys peanuts put in bowls by strangers. He didn\u2019t wait for us to accuse him and he didn\u2019t wait for a camera because his relationship with cameras was lust and shame and he had decided to be a monk. He said, very clearly, that he had written the escalation note because he believed in the beauty of clean paperwork, and that he believed if lawyers managed the mess then no flesh would have to, and that he liked the feeling of being the man who could stop a river by writing river twice. He said, just as clearly, that he did not read the hazard notes because he trusted Brazos to fight gravity and he trusted the math because math had never broken his heart. He said he was wrong. He said he had facilities in his house for grief but none good enough. He took the bowl and started to carry it and did not look back.\n\nBy Thursday, as promised, we had a murderer who was not a murderer and a murder which was a culture and a city that had agreed to try to learn a new song. It did not feel like victory. It felt like a day in which the lights worked and the mail arrived on time, which is what victory feels like when you govern without trumpets. We filed the Speed Limit into the Directory because Alma said the Directory likes its teeth brushed, and we told Weather to put notices on all their doors that said We Are Not A Studio so even the janitors would be forced to pronounce the difference as they passed. Howell sent me a postcard from somewhere with a dune on it and a lighthouse, and on the back of it he had written a sentence in pencil like a man trying out letters for the first time: You will want to save someone personally now; you will be tempted to make a room for them and call it a law; resist. I put the postcard under the refrigerator magnet shaped like a pear because pears are honest about ripening and because I wanted to insult Howell with fruit.\n\nSparrow found an elevator that cried at noon and made it take a breath and calm down, and in return it offered a small offering from a ledge only elevators know how to find: a paperclip bent into an arrow and a receipt for pastries from a bakery Anahi had favored. On the back of the receipt, someone had written in tight script: The stairs think they are superior. Teach them humility by resting on them. It wasn\u2019t a lead, not exactly; it was a way to keep from becoming the kind of government that forgets to sit. We took it, gratefully, and went to the bakery and purchased too many good things and paid cash so no one could make a graph of our appetites. The woman behind the counter knew Sparrow and put an extra bun into our bag, saying, \u201cFor the rooms,\u201d and Sparrow laughed in a way that made the air heavier with kindness. Sometimes the city meets you halfway because you remembered to hum on an elevator and sometimes it meets you because buns are good and cost what we can afford.\n\nThere were still places we had not put our mark and still corners that preferred rooms without windows. We had not found Anahi in any shape a person could hug, and I had not watched the car flip again because I was not a ghoul and because there are truths you hold in reserve like a last coin. We had written a writ and a law and taught a bridge to be polite. We had been on television and put a flag in a window and convinced a bowl to become ceremony. North had learned the names that doors like to be called and I had learned to ask the air to let children pass in front of me when the hallway got narrow. We were not done, but we were not trapped. In this work, both are miracles, and you cannot teach miracles so much as you can feed them when they show up hungry.",

                              "content": "The first time the air bent around me, we were three minutes from going live, and the evening anchor asked if I kept a diary for my characters.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, because it felt like the right thing to say, and because the little green light on the camera lens looked like a pupil and I wanted to be believed by something that could never blink.\n\nCarlotta\u2014our makeup artist, fingers steady as the plumb line of a high-rise\u2014paused mid-swab. \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ve never kept a diary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d I whispered back, though my voice seemed to drop into the space beneath the chair. The floor chilled. Frost scrolled outward from the feet of the stool like fast-growing lichen. Carlotta yanked her hand back with a tiny tut, and the anchor\u2019s earpiece crackled. The teleprompter hiccuped two lines, repeated a sentence, then rolled on, as if it hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d asked the anchor. He had a professional concern, the kind that wore makeup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I said, brightly. \u201cI keep diaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d he said, smiling, the camera winked, and the whole room decided to believe me for exactly four seconds.\n\nAfter, in the corridor where you can smell the way the building was designed to smell\u2014fresh coffee, citrus, nothing too human\u2014my agent caught up with me. His name was Dax, which he wore like a tie he hadn\u2019t chosen.\n\n\u201cThey want you back next month for the awards round-up,\u201d he said, hands skittering in the pocket of his suit. \u201cYou were charming. You were a little\u2026\u201d He wobbled his head left-right. \u201cIs it the pills?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on pills,\u201d I said. \u201cShould I be?\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head to look at me. People tilt their heads when something doesn\u2019t slot into their expected groove. \u201cYou felt cold,\u201d he said, and rubbed his forearms as if my proximity had stained him. Then he was smiling again. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the air-con. The anchor\u2019s anemic. You know how it is.\u201d\n\nThe anchor wasn\u2019t anemic. The anchor ran marathons and had a podcast about sunrises. People who run in dawn light are the opposite of anemia. But I nodded, because the easiest way to move in this industry is to nod and tell the room it\u2019s right until you can get to the door and remember your actual name.\n\nOutside the studio we were in the part of the city that used to be warehouses and now was restaurants with ferns. Drones treated us like siblings, trailing in weird sibling formations. They had good manners. They always stayed out of the way. People didn\u2019t. A pair of tourists angled in for a selfie and my body arranged itself to fit the frame. Auto-smile. They asked if I was the real me, the way you ask a window if it\u2019s rain or just someone else\u2019s breath.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m real,\u201d I said. My breath did not fog the air.\n\nDax\u2019s phone was on vibrate but it throbbed like a living thing in his pocket, a heart that wanted its own show. \u201cThey\u2019ve moved the table read up. Can you be at Stage E by three?\u201d He glanced at me sideways. \u201cDon\u2019t flake, Mira.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t flake,\u201d I said. He was already moving. So was I, because movement makes a person look like they have a plan. It\u2019s a trick I learned when I was still stepping out on taped marks and believing the love story at the end of page forty-eight.\n\nStage E was a big hangar with a roof like a mouth. The script pages were new enough to still have the smell of toner, bitter and a little sweet. I was supposed to be a detective who fell in love with a bomb disposal expert, which was fun because when we shot the trailer last month, our bomb disposal expert had tripped over a cable and laughed for eight minutes like a kettle that had seen God, and now his knees were carefully bandaged, pallid little pretzels.\n\n\u201cHey, Mira,\u201d called Jonah, who played the rival detective with the troubled childhood. Jonah waved a page at me. He had terrible posture and a face made for close-ups. You never would have cast him as anything other than a man who waited behind a door and said something devastating.\n\nHe said something devastating when we broke for coffee. \u201cYou should hire a sidekick,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want them to take you seriously as a detective.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cA sidekick,\u201d I said. \u201cLike, to get my lines? Is that an insult?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that kind,\u201d he said, and leaned in, as if the air could be trusted not to pick our words up and carry them away. \u201cA Guardian. The Aegis program. They\u2019re rolling it out wider. If you had a Guardian, they\u2019d have to let you into the meetings. You could see the files.\u201d\n\nI thought he was doing a bit. We did bits. It made the hours pass like a better kind of weather. \u201cInto what meetings?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb,\u201d he said, not unkindly. \u201cThe Choir keeps shutting you out. Or shutting Dax out. Or just humming at the door until your calendar forgets you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Choir,\u201d I said. It was a joke. It had started as a joke. But like most jokes about how power worked, it had the unfashionable habit of being accurate.\n\nWhen the world hit the kind of turbulence that rattles teeth, the women moved into government by means that looked like luck and were not. They inherited, they were appointed to fill gaps, they volunteered for committees no one else wanted, they smiled at the end of everything they said so the room could imagine itself generous. They networked sideways, diagonals across departments, up through the climate vertical and the ethics sprig. Screenshots passed hand to hand in bathrooms. A policy advisor named Anahi traced the first map on the back of a check for a latte no one ever cashed. People called them infiltrators because the old language for entering a place was always war.\n\nThey called themselves the Choir when they had to call themselves something. If you ask them, they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s not a conspiracy; it\u2019s an alignment. They hit pitch together. They knew which walls could take harmony. They made legislation that held changes in place like a good bridge holds a river\u2014in motion and in shape. Also: they kept a few doors shut, and if you had the wrong face at the wrong time, you were told to wait in the lounge and be patient. I have a face people like to point lights at, which is sometimes the wrong face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not feasible,\u201d I told Jonah. \u201cYou don\u2019t just go to a store and buy a Guardian.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jonah said cheerfully. \u201cYou get assigned one. If you\u2019re a world leader.\u201d\n\nI was an actor. I was good at it, even on bad days, even when the camera felt like a mouth. I was not a world leader. But Jonah was watching me with that expression he wore when he knew more than he wanted to. \u201cYou want a Guardian,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBecause you\u2019re trying to figure out who\u2019s been robbing you.\u201d\n\nThe thefts had been small at first, like mice. Ten minutes gone from a morning. Fifteen from a dinner. A meeting where everyone acted like they\u2019d already had the conversation without me. Then a week last autumn where I woke with the sure, packed feeling that I had once stood in a bright place and said a terrible sentence. Then: evidence. A streaming platform that glitched my face into a different actress\u2019s smile. A lawyer\u2019s email with my name misspelled in a way it had never been misspelled before. \u201cYou think that\u2019s a crime,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI think all interesting theft is crime,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all boring theft is budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would a Guardian help?\u201d I still couldn\u2019t keep the laughter out of my voice. I wanted to, but laughter is like breath: it sneaks. \u201cThey\u2019re for presidents. Not for fakes. Not for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresidents are fakes,\u201d said Jonah quietly, and then he smiled, and the smile had angles I knew because I\u2019d seen them on-screen, but it wasn\u2019t the same. \u201cThe Aegis program pairs heads of state with people who can hit things and also know how to smell trouble behind glass. They\u2019re licensed. They can do things no one else can. Warrantless intuition. There\u2019s a treaty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a treaty,\u201d I repeated. \u201cDid you make this up in the line for coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook it up,\u201d he said, and slid me a folded paper. An actual paper, not a link, not a QR. The title across the top: Directory of Recognized Sovereigns, updated in pale ink, the last page of an info packet only someone inside the room would have. At the bottom, a note\u2014handwritten\u2014Eligible for Aegis Pairing: confirmed. Eligibility restricted to heads of state or de facto world leaders with Directory recognition. The swoop of the pen felt familiar, like I should know the hand and didn\u2019t. \u201cYou do a thing with your mouth when you\u2019re angry,\u201d Jonah said conversationally. \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can talk,\u201d I said. Then we were called back and the bombs were fake again and so were we.\n\nAt lunch I went to the restroom because you can always go to the restroom. The mirror above the sinks admired me. That was its job. It did its job. It showed my hair in the color my fans fought over on message boards. It showed the little scar at the corner of my eye that we didn\u2019t erase in post because it made me accessible. It showed my mouth not doing anything unfortunate with anger.\n\nThere were no droplets on the mirror\u2019s surface. It was dry as paper. The girl at the end of the row\u2014new background, cheeks still with teenage softness\u2014was practicing her smile. Her reflection showed her. Mine showed me.\n\nI put my hand out toward the glass and didn\u2019t meet it. My palm felt a pressure that wasn\u2019t exactly pressure. It was like pushing into high wind, except the air around us was still and lemon-scented.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d the girl asked. She was watching me and not watching me at the same time, which is a skill. \u201cYou look like you saw, like, something.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rehearsing,\u201d I said, because that is the laminate I lay over anything the world might not understand. \u201cGreat tip,\u201d I added. \u201cPractice your smile in your car with the seatbelt on. If you have to smile under compression, it\u2019s muscle memory.\u201d It was good advice. I wished it were mine.\n\nShe lit with gratitude. It was like turning on a lamp in wrongdoing. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.\n\nI pressed harder against the mirror. It should have gone cool under my skin. It didn\u2019t. It felt like writing with chalk on glass, like the air between us was full of powdered bone.\n\nWhen the day wrapped the shadows off Stage E and packed them away in someone\u2019s trunk, I walked the long outside\u2019s edges, past posters for movies that had never been made and posters for movies I had made and never watched. People watched. They watched on phones and in baths and on trains where the lights went out and everyone pretended not to be afraid. It\u2019s an intimacy. We pretend it\u2019s not.\n\nA woman sat on the edge of the backlot fountain. Her face was an arrangement you could find in any decade. She wore an overcoat that would have been dramatic if not for the fact it was the same color as the sky. Gray was a glove the day put over itself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said, even though we had not agreed to meet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m famous,\u201d I said. \u201cI tried to be on time and five different people wanted a picture with my elbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your picture,\u201d she said. \u201cI want your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cMira Leland,\u201d I said, because that was what it said on my contracts. I still used my birth name with my sister and my tax returns. You hold on to the names that know your ribs.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask what your contracts say,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should try listening the first time. It saves all sorts of heartache later.\u201d Her smile wasn\u2019t unkind. It was precise. \u201cCall me Alma.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I know you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know my Choir,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cEveryone pretends they don\u2019t know my Choir. It\u2019s the only way we get any work done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re with the government,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be vulgar,\u201d she said, and then she laughed. I wanted that laugh to be unmusical. It wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe are the government, if you mean by that the scaffolding around it. Sometimes you let the walls put their own scaffolding up. They choose pretty or ugly and either way we hold. Sometimes, Mira, we hold a door shut.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I being shut out?\u201d I asked. \u201cFrom what?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom being prey,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are keeping you. Not safe, exactly. Seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one asked me,\u201d I said. The mirror in the bathroom had also not asked me. The air was full of things that didn\u2019t ask and did anyway.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ask children if they want their hands held crossing a road,\u201d said Alma. \u201cYou\u2019re not a child. You\u2019re an asset.\u201d\n\nThere it was. The blunt thing. It\u2019s a relief when someone lets go of nuance. It\u2019s like taking heels off.\n\n\u201cGet to your point,\u201d I said. \u201cIf there is one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a Guardian,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get a Guardian without being recognized by the Directory. You can\u2019t be recognized by the Directory unless you are a head of state.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich you can be,\u201d she said. Her eyes were a color you couldn\u2019t trust. It was the color of a sky that might mean rain. \u201cRules change. We change them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d make me a president so I can get a bodyguard,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a sign at the entrance to a theme park in hell. Why. And why me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good actress,\u201d Alma said. \u201cPeople think you are what you say you are. That\u2019s useful in a leader. You care about harm. You can smell it. That\u2019s useful in a leader. You are missing time.\u201d She held up a hand when my mouth opened. \u201cWe know. We measure the holes. That\u2019s useful in a leader, too. Leaders are at their best when they are searching for something they have lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make me a leader,\u201d I said, \u201cso you can assign me a Guardian and then you can listen in on everything I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cWe\u2019re the government. We\u2019re always listening. Also, we need you to do something that cannot be done in any other way and not be\u2014how do you say\u2014untidy about it. You will want to do it. It will work out. Mostly.\u201d\n\nThe fountain was switched off in winter. I stared at a stone horse with water stains like old crying. \u201cWhat thing,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cFind out who killed you,\u201d said Alma.\n\nYou know the way a sentence can slice you into the person you were before you heard it and the person you are after. The first person is a ghost to the second. A joke, since I laughed then. I laughed because it was a ridiculous line and because laughter is the fail-safe. \u201cI\u2019m not dead,\u201d I said. \u201cI was just on television. You were probably watching and shouting at me.\u201d\n\nAlma\u2019s head tilted. The wind must have moved. I felt my hair adjust. It had weight, which seemed important. \u201cTelevision is haunted,\u201d she said. \u201cIt always has been. I didn\u2019t shout at your appearance. I was busy. But it was a good performance. The part where you lied and Carlotta\u2019s fingers went cold. You\u2019re learning control.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf what, exactly,\u201d I said, and tasted the of like a coin.\n\n\u201cOf walls,\u201d she said. \u201cOf glass. Of exits. Of people\u2019s heat. You died six months ago, Mira. During the stunt with the car flip on the 101 set. We shut it down before it reached the news. Do you want the file name? We can be vulgar.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sister would notice,\u201d I said. \u201cEveryone would notice. Wouldn\u2019t they.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone noticed,\u201d said Alma. \u201cThen we made them unnotice. You\u2019re useful. Not just because you can smile into the mouth of the world. Ask Jonah. He thinks he\u2019s the only one who knows. He thinks he\u2019s doing you a mercy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw him today,\u201d I said, and the act of admitting seeing shifted something behind my sternum. It was not pain. It was the shape of an absence.\n\nAlma tucked something into my jacket pocket. It was heavy. \u201cYou are not a solid,\u201d she said, and the way she said it made it sound like philosophy, not insult. \u201cYou are a velocity. That\u2019s why we want you. That\u2019s why they want you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are they,\u201d I said.\n\nShe smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out faster with a Guardian. Take the Directory. Think of a country. You don\u2019t need land. Land is for people who think everything is a one-to-one map. You need jurisdiction. You need ceremony. You\u2019ll be the head of the State of Something. Pick something.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe State of Something,\u201d I said. \u201cIt sounds like a teenager\u2019s band.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll think of a better name,\u201d she said, standing. She was taller than I had thought. She did not step back like a person afraid of bumping me. She walked through the micro-weather around me as if it were a curtain she\u2019d borrowed. \u201cYou have two days. We already widened the definition. Be quick, Mira. Some doors close loudly.\u201d\n\nAfter she left, I put my hand in my pocket. The metal against my palm was cold in a way that felt honest. It was a sovereign seal machine, the handheld kind you\u2019d use to press a seal into wax if your diplomacy required wax. It was stamped with a field of small stars and one larger one split in half. The handle was smooth from someone else\u2019s hand. It had belonged to Anahi, if the letters scratched into the underside meant anything. I squeezed until my fingers remembered how to ache.\n\nThe trick with being told you\u2019re dead is that nothing, exactly, changes in the second after. The cars still pass. The lamppost flickers and then remembers itself. A woman in the distance fights her groceries. Face recognition in billboards blinks and recalibrates and misreads and gets me and then doesn\u2019t.\n\nHere\u2019s the worst part. A small part of me already knew. That part had been putting out bowls of water for a dog that had not come home. That part had been staring at my reflection and counting more than the mirror would ever count back.\n\nI went home because going home is the only thing you can do when you cannot think of a better thing. My apartment was the kind that gets photographed when magazines want to do a feature on how mortality can be softened with textiles. There were plants. There was a view. There was a painting my sister had made when we were eleven because we had a teacher who thought everyone should paint the sky and my sister had decided the sky was a bruise. It was titled: Girl With Two Names. She\u2019d given it to me to keep me honest.\n\nThe security system purred hello. The lights warmed as if the house were putting its palms out toward me. I set the sovereign seal on the counter, next to the bowl where I left keys even though keys seemed increasingly symbolic. The bowl had a chip in the rim. I liked the chip because it felt like a secret handshake with damage. None of the plants had died, because the system watered them and because plants are often better at living without us than we are without them.\n\nI called my sister. Her name is Luca, and she peels apples with the same kind of concentration she used to peel wallpaper. She picked up on the third ring. \u201cTell me you\u2019ve escaped your handlers,\u201d she said. \u201cTell me you\u2019re out somewhere you\u2019ll regret.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met a woman,\u201d I said. \u201cShe says I\u2019m dead.\u201d\n\nSilence is a sound. You don\u2019t notice it until you are listening to it. \u201cIs this a bit,\u201d Luca said finally. She was stirring something. I could hear the soft rebellion of boiling water.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think or you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d The word scraped. \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re dead,\u201d she said, \u201cwho am I talking to.\u201d\n\nYou can love someone and still be ruthless with them, because love and ruthlessness are cousins. \u201cMaybe the someone you were always talking to,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve been\u2026 adjacent for a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me,\u201d she said plainly. \u201cI\u2019m going to come over.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, because I didn\u2019t know what would happen when she walked through my air. \u201cLater. Please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said please,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t say please unless you\u2019ve already done the thing you need permission for.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you remember the car flip,\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about work when we talk,\u201d she said, small reflex. Then she laughed, a small, surprised laugh. \u201cExcept we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe day of the flip,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember making bread because the radio said words like \u2018tie-in\u2019 and \u2018staggered release window\u2019 and I needed to pound something. I remember your forehead feeling like the back of a fridge when you came over to eat the bread and lie on my couch and watch those stupid videos of dogs who have been reunited with soldiers. I remember thinking: she\u2019s not here. I remember thinking: strange, how light doesn\u2019t warm.\u201d She inhaled. \u201cI\u2019m coming over.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask me if I was okay. She didn\u2019t ask me if I wanted soup. She hung up, and the house and I listened to the soundlessness before the doorbell rings.\n\nI put the kettle on because there are things you do even when you are not a solid. You make tea. You lay out the good cups. You move in the patterns of a person and hope the pattern convinces the surface tension.\n\nThe doorbell rang and the intercom screen blinked. There was her face, my face if it had grown up into a different kind of certainty. I pressed the button and said, \u201cCome up.\u201d The lock released. Her footsteps in the hall were her footsteps in the hall were her bare feet on the suburban stairs of our childhood house. Memory is stupid like that. It layers.\n\nShe came in and stopped dead in the doorway. Because she could feel it. People can feel the difference in the air the way they can feel pressure change before rain. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, and then she was crying and then she was laughing because we are the kind of family that laughs to keep the cry from blowing the roof off. She took two steps and then another and then stopped again because her arms had reached that place where they wanted to close around me and didn\u2019t know what would come back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I said. It is a short sentence. It can be a lie. I made it as true as I could.\n\nShe lowered her arms. She did not touch me. She retired engagement like a flag. She went to the counter and touched the sovereign seal instead. \u201cWhat\u2019s this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might become a country,\u201d I said.\n\nShe wiped her cheeks with the heel of her hand. \u201cOf course you will,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t decided,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to be recognized so I can get a Guardian so I can find out who stole me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing,\u201d she said, and it was not a question.\n\n\u201cThe thing,\u201d I said.\n\nShe made the tea. She fetched the good cups I had already set out. She talked about who had called her today, about the neighbor who had left jasmine on the windowsill, about the smallnesses that keep you upright. She slipped the important questions between like cards. \u201cIf this is true\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIf,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you died. Why would they bring you back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was never away,\u201d I said. Or: \u201cMaybe away isn\u2019t the right idea. Maybe I fell forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always did,\u201d she said. She lifted her cup, held it under her face, inhaled the steam. The steam rose around her and didn\u2019t so much as brush me. \u201cWhat do you call a country with no land.\u201d\n\n\u201cA state of mind,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cA state of the art,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cA state of emergency,\u201d I said.\n\nShe snapped her fingers. She has always been better at names than me. \u201cInterim,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Interim. The sovereign state of the time between.\u201d She smiled, and the smile had the exact measure of wicked you can only have when you love someone too much to leave the joke alone. \u201cIt\u2019s accurate.\u201d\n\nI tried it on in my mouth. \u201cI am the Custodian of the Interim,\u201d I said. It tasted like tin. \u201cIt sounds like a janitor at a metaphysical museum.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always wanted to work in museum,\u201d she said. She rifled the Directory paperwork, a little pale with the kind of pale you get when you fight a timeline and lose. Small print, signatures, clauses that described a person you might not recognize. \u201cWe can do this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks like we can. Do you need a flag.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone needs a flag,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can use the painting.\u201d\n\nShe looked over her shoulder at the Girl With Two Names, all bruise and horizon. \u201cToo heavy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need something that looks good in wind.\u201d\n\nWe were still laughing when the lights dimmed, and it wasn\u2019t the house dimming them, and the laughter died because the dimness had nothing to do with the roof. The dimness was inside the room like another person. The temperature dropped, I suppose. I don\u2019t know. The word temperature originates inside a body. I could only measure change by the way Luca\u2019s breath thickened.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching you,\u201d said an entirely reasonable voice. It came from the corridor where the light refused to go. \u201cI\u2019d like to help.\u201d\n\nThe old me would have screamed. The actress me would have said: who\u2019s there. The new me\u2014the one with a sovereign seal pressed into her palm and the echo of a woman\u2019s words inside her skull like a repeating hallway\u2014said, \u201cStep into the kitchen. It\u2019s better for introductions.\u201d\n\nHe did. He was not what the dimness implied. He was smaller and blunter and realer. He wore second-hand clothes with first-hand care. He had the bearing of someone who had learned to take up exactly as much space as would not earn him attention, which is to say: a survivor. \u201cCall me North,\u201d he said, as if I had asked for directions.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want,\u201d Luca said, standing between him and me without making a show of it.\n\n\u201cTo apply,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a casting,\u201d I said, which was a cruel line in a life like mine.\n\nHe smiled like a door. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a sidekick,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you become head of the Interim. Alarms aren\u2019t going to be enough. Alms aren\u2019t going to be enough. Call it what you want. Guardian, shadow, second. You\u2019ll need someone to carry the flashlight while you carry the flag.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you find me,\u201d I said. Which is the wrong question. The right question is: why do you think you know my shape.\n\n\u201cI know where the holes are,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been living in them a while. And besides, you asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d he said. \u201cYou looked at the mirror and you said please.\u201d\n\nHe was here and he had eyes like maps of the city at dawn. My kettle went off like a temper. I took it off the heat. I kept my hand in the steam. I stayed. \u201cYou know there\u2019s a process,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know the Directory requires paperwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have paperwork,\u201d he said, and put on the counter, beside the sovereign seal, a card. It was plastic the way a wedding ring is gold: it meant it but also it didn\u2019t. At the top, in small letters, Aegis Program, Adjunct Grade. Below that, in the thick font that is supposed to stop people from faking it, NORTH, NO OTHER NAMES. The rest was signed by no one I recognized and everyone who mattered. The date was yesterday. Approval: conditional.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re prepped,\u201d I said. \u201cI haven\u2019t even named my state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought of a few for you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you should pick your own.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow,\u201d Luca said quietly, \u201cdid you get an Adjunct card for a program that doesn\u2019t accept applications unless the head of state requests you by name.\u201d\n\nHe met her eyes with respect. \u201cTurns out I died, too,\u201d he said.\n\nSo we were three, in a kitchen with good cups and no warmth, and the room had the rich taste of danger in it, like cocoa. I picked up the seal. I held it like it might know what it was for. Somewhere, not far and not near, a woman who had named the world after an instrument was moving a piece on a board. I could feel Alma in the grain of the table. I could feel the city in my teeth.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cOkay. The Interim. The state between. You\u2019ll be my\u2014what. My lantern.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour North,\u201d he said gently.\n\n\u201cI have a sister,\u201d I said, helpless.\n\n\u201cShe can be your north, too,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have more than one.\u201d\n\nI stamped the seal on a napkin because the wax hadn\u2019t arrived and because I needed to see whether pressure still made a mark. It did. The paper dented. The symbol printed. The halves of the star stayed separate. \u201cTell me,\u201d I said to North, to Luca, to the Directory, to any gods that were not offended by paperwork. \u201cTell me what happens when I declare a country.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t declare,\u201d said Alma, from the doorway. I didn\u2019t turn because I had expected her and because you lose points when you let the unseen get the jump on you. \u201cYou recognize. You recognize what already exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recognize,\u201d I said. \u201cThe Interim exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we raise your flag,\u201d said Alma. \u201cThen the Choir sings. Then you get your sidekick. Then you go find your murderer. Not necessarily in that order.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t like the order,\u201d I said.\n\nShe smiled. \u201cBuild a new one,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what governments are for.\u201d\n\nAt midnight I went to bed and dreamt of the back lot fountain running. The stone horse dipped its head to drink from its own mouth. In the dream the water ran backward and upward, and my sister painted the sky with different bruises until she found the exact shade of gone.\n\nWhen I woke, the apartment still smelled of tea. The seal was on the counter, tilted like it had listened all night. The Directory lay open to a page that had not been there before. The page read: State of Interim (provisional). Leader: Custodian Mira Leland (no other names). Flag: to be determined. Eligibility: immediate.\n\nI made coffee for the drama of it. Only one thing was wrong. My phone showed a feed of pictures from the night before. There I was in the kitchen, holding nothing. There Luca was, holding a cup. There the doorway. There the absence where a man should have been. There the air that had learned to stand like a person.\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect,\u201d said a voice from under the table.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said to the air, because it was early and I had not yet decided which rules to rewrite. \u201cYou don\u2019t show up on cameras.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither do you,\u201d said North. \u201cNot the way you think.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won a cinematography award indirectly,\u201d I told him. He laughed, and it shook the dust.\n\nWe put two chairs at the table. I sat in one. He sat in the other with his back very straight, like an old photograph of a boy about to go to war. Luca arrived in the morning clothes of a person who had slept in her clothes. Alma did not come because boundaries help. The city chewed and breathed and inhaled the quiet hours between us as if they were oxygen.\n\nI didn\u2019t give a speech. I signed. We sang a few lines from a song we both remembered from a church our mother had pretended to believe in to make the neighbors kind. We made it up as we went along. That\u2019s the only way anyone has ever built anything.\n\nBy lunch, the Choir had logged me. By afternoon, the flag had a shape: a field of blue-gray and a thin white line running through it like horizon. By evening, messages arrived, and they were already old, like light from stars that had decided to reach us. An embassy asked where to send a bouquet. A late night host wrote a monologue. A woman in a state where the water did not boil safe sent me a photo of her daughter wearing a paper crown.\n\nAnd somewhere close, and somewhere far, someone smiled in a way that did not require their face to move. They had killed me once. They had made a hole. They had done a bad thing in a clean room. The Interim was my hand on the glass.\n\nWe had dinner the way people do who are trying to prove they are unkillable. We ate leftovers. We argued about whether a state should collect taxes. We watched a movie I was not in. We fell asleep on the couch, my head near the cushion and not on it, Luca\u2019s hand near my hair and not in it, North\u2019s boots near the door like a promise.\n\nI dreamt of the car, the flip, the way the world can turn over and still pretend to be continuous. I dreamt of the moment in the mirror when the boy practicing his smile realized he had gotten it right. I woke to the sound of someone knocking on the door, softly and insistently, like a neighbor or a future.\n\nOn the threshold, a parcel. No return address. Inside, wax in a tin the color of ruined gold, a flag sewn by a hand I couldn\u2019t name, and a note written in that precise hand I should have recognized the first time.\n\nWelcome to the government, it said. Try not to die again. It\u2019s becoming a habit.",

                              "content": "The parcel had the weight of a held breath, the kind you take before you go under and pretend that water is just another kind of air. The wax inside the tin smelled faintly of rosemary and coins, a scent with ancestry. The flag was stitched from a fabric with memory; when I lifted it, it tried to turn toward a breeze that wasn\u2019t there, as if it knew where up was better than I did. The note, with its tidy geometries of ink, did not tremble. It did not have to. It knew it could make hands shake on its behalf.\n\nWe did not have a balcony, only a window with a ledge and a civic sense of danger. We made the ledge into a balcony by believing in it together. Luca taped the flag to a pole that had been a broom handle until five minutes ago, and North, who was not on my feed or any feed but whose presence pressed the air into shapes, weighed the base with a bag of rice and a cast-iron pan. We raised the Interim over a city that hadn\u2019t decided yet whether to notice and pretended it was accustomed to being flown over things it did not govern. I expected trumpets and was blessed with the ordinary, which has its own tone: a siren three streets away, a drone trilling pleasantly as it recalibrated around a new object in its sky map, a neighbor\u2019s radio finding a station and then apologizing with static. The fabric lifted a little, then settled, then lifted. If you\u2019ve ever taught a word to a parrot you understand the patience. It takes time for meaning to stick.\n\nCeremony, Alma had said, and she was right, though not for the reasons she prefers. You have to touch things to make them agree to be true. We heated a spoon over the stove and poured the ruined-gold wax into a circle on the heavy paper the Directory had provided, a paper with the faint tooth of archival vows. I pressed the half-star seal into the pool and felt the wax resist with a muscle\u2019s kind of intelligence. It accepted the impression the way flesh accepts a bruise, as a record and as a suggestion to be careful. Luca signed as Witness of Kin with the flourish she reserves for people at the bank, and North, whose name pretended to leave no fingerprints, signed as Adjunct with a hand that looked like it had learned writing sideways, in margins, in light that failed to reach all the way down.\n\nThe form asked me to list the borders of the Interim, and I wrote: anywhere a breath fogs a window and leaves the ghost of a handprint. It asked me to specify my jurisdiction and I wrote: the time between decision and action. It asked me to confirm my anthem, and we wrote three lines from a song our mother loved and then crossed them out and wrote an instruction instead: hum until the room agrees to hush. It asked me if the Interim would levy taxes and we checked a box that did not exist and wrote beside it: debts forgiven upon evidence of sincerity. You can build a country like that and a clerk will roll their eyes and make another box appear and stamp it not-a-threat and we call that the miracle of paper.\n\nWhen Dax called at nine, my phone shook itself like a wet dog. He did not say hello because he doesn\u2019t believe in expenditure without return. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re trending three different ways, two of them delightful.\u201d He said, \u201cPeople love a woman with a flag.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat did you do.\u201d His voice did not rise at the end because he knew the answer in the way a person knows the smell of rain. I put him on speaker because I like my sister to hear the things I\u2019m supposed to pretend not to hear.\n\n\u201cI accepted an offer of nationhood,\u201d I said. I tried to sound like someone who had had a good breakfast. \u201cIt comes with benefits. Healthcare. A seal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for satire,\u201d he said, but he was already tapping and reading because that\u2019s what he does when the world moves. \u201cOkay, I see the press release. Did you send a press release.\u201d His inhale found a snag. \u201cMira. Who sent a press release.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hummed,\u201d I said. \u201cThe room hushed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are going to tell me you\u2019ve been recognized by a panel that acknowledges unaffiliated states of mind,\u201d he said, rapid, the way a magician does patter before the reveal. \u201cYou are going to tell me there\u2019s a treaty that says if you hum in a certain register someone hands you a bodyguard and lets you walk into rooms where people decide where the water goes when it overflows. You are going to get me sued by metaphysics.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the Aegis program,\u201d I said, because names make men feel better. \u201cYou\u2019ve never liked metaphysics unless it stared back. Don\u2019t worry. It will.\u201d\n\nHe went quiet. He is never quiet unless there\u2019s an invoice ticking in him. \u201cYou\u2019re not making sense,\u201d he said finally, softer. \u201cAnd you\u2019re colder than usual. Are you near a vent. Don\u2019t be near a vent when you talk to a journalist. They\u2019ll write about the way you don\u2019t fog glass and they won\u2019t bother to check if the air-conditioning just reads wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cDax,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you remember the car flip.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not for press,\u201d he said reflex, and then the reflex unhooked and fell. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I know the memo. I know we lost a day and gained a lawsuit that never arrived. I know you brought me bread and put your feet on my coffee table and complained that cinnamon had become a conspiracy. I know your skin felt like someone had warm hands on you from a distance. I know they told me not to put you on late-night for six weeks and then they told me to put you on everything for eight months. I am a professional opportunist. I can hold two orders at once. What game have you climbed into now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one with rules that change while you watch,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s called governance.\u201d\n\nHe breathed out, the sound of a man who has recognized a path that does not include him even though he sold the maps. \u201cSay yes when they ask you about the charity tie-in,\u201d he said, brisk again, the way you become when you have decided to swim under the wave instead of fighting it. \u201cSay the Interim is dedicated to interstitial spaces and their inhabitants. Smile like people deserve kindness and like you are the person delivering it. I\u2019ll send you a bullet list. Please, Mira, do not bite a host. Watch the hands that look like they could be clean.\u201d\n\nAfter he hung up, I looked at North, who had been reading the Directory with the intentness of someone who expects the paper to turn into a door at any minute. \u201cWarrantless intuition,\u201d I said. \u201cShow me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ugly phrase,\u201d he said, and he didn\u2019t mean the grammar. He touched the wax we had just sealed and then lifted his finger to his mouth, not to taste but to breathe on, as if the lines in the pad could read. \u201cWe don\u2019t break in. We decide that the lock has made a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you telling me you pick doors by apologizing to them,\u201d Luca said, at the stove, digging the last of the honey with a sternness that would have frightened any bear worth its title. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been married to people like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoors open for apology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey close for excuses.\u201d He went to the counter where the parcel lay open and studied the tin that had held the wax. He held it the way you hold a baby bird you plan to release, careful and unselfconscious. \u201cThere\u2019s a smell in this,\u201d he said finally. \u201cNot the rosemary. Not the coins. Something like stone dust and hot filament. We sniff those, in the holes. We learn the difference between accident and decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were there,\u201d I said, and the words stepped wrong in my mouth, like a foot finding the edge of a stair lower than expected. \u201cThe day of the flip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was within listening distance of the road,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a paper taped to the call sheet no one had printed. It wasn\u2019t on the grid. It had a watermark I couldn\u2019t see until I put it in my pocket and forgot it there for an hour. When I remembered to look, the paper had erased itself and left only a smell. It smelled like this tin.\u201d He set the tin down gently, as if gentleness could undo intent. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch your car. There were enough hands on it already.\u201d\n\nWe went to the place where hands had been. It had been redressed as a different warehouse and a different stretch of highway, because the city does that when it is paid. Security at the gate was a woman with eyebrows painted on with absolute loyalty to a curve she had agreed upon in youth, and a clipboard that wanted to be a sword. Her uniform had a patch that said Saffron in small letters, and when she took my ID she held it like a metaphor she didn\u2019t have time for. When North put down his card, she did not see it, but her hand moved the way hands move when the temperature of their work changes.\n\n\u201cAegis,\u201d she said, without looking at the letters. \u201cRight. You can go in. Don\u2019t bleed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that to all your guests,\u201d Luca said, and Saffron blinked, the first sign of humanity, as if someone had told a joke in a language she hadn\u2019t expected to hear on her shift.\n\nThe warehouse smelled like wood pretending to be steel and steel pretending to be wood. The marks the crew had made months ago were still on the floor in tape and scuffs and a path worn by footsteps. The practice car sat under a tarp with an attitude, the tarp squared off like a soldier\u2019s bed. Brazos, our stunt coordinator, emerged from a stack of mats like a man who has learned to forgive gravity for being so predictable, and his hands looked like they had been braided by rope. He loved his work the way some people love high windows, quietly and with fanatic care.\n\n\u201cI heard you died,\u201d he said, and there was no malice in it, only everybody\u2019s attempt at courtesy. \u201cDidn\u2019t seem to stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt leaves marks,\u201d I said, and he nodded, as if I had pointed out a harness burn he\u2019d watched form.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do the flip,\u201d he said, which would have been a great note months ago. \u201cYou remember the pre-vis. You remember the math. We don\u2019t ask engines to speak French. We talk to them in ratios. Somebody sneaked a subjunctive into my calculus, and I don\u2019t teach verbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho asked for an extra take,\u201d North said, and if he had been a cop it would have been a hard question, but he was not a cop. He was someone asking a table if it would prefer to be a door.\n\nBrazos rubbed the back of his neck the way wrestlers do when they consider a tie. \u201cThe grey guy,\u201d he said. \u201cCompliance. He didn\u2019t have a name. He had a laminate that had been laminated twice, the kind of ID you make when you expect to be arrested and want the arresting officer to second-guess her eyes. He was with a woman in a coat. She didn\u2019t talk. She pointed. He pointed at the pointing. He said we were doing great work and that somebody upstairs wanted a clean take for insurance. He said that nobody loses their house if we give him one more reel. I don\u2019t like to be used to keep a person in a house. I let him have it because I like to help a house keep a person. Do you see the trap. It\u2019s an honest trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was daylight,\u201d I said. \u201cI remember the day not dark yet. He wore the sort of gray that only exists when the sun is still deciding whether color is a suggestion or a rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Brazos said, eyes grateful, because when you match someone\u2019s shade it tells them you belong in the picture.\n\nHe led us to the rig as if it were a person he didn\u2019t want to spook. He knew the places to lay a hand as you might know a lover\u2019s shoulder. The struts had been replaced with struts. The shell had been repainted to be something else entirely. That is how sets apologize for damage: they change clothes. I put my palm on the hood and felt nothing a human would have cataloged as heat, but the air around my hand altered as if it had overheard its name in a different room. Frost sketched itself out from my wrist in a pattern that looked almost like handwriting, and I didn\u2019t pull away because I was learning that pulling away leaves the room with your shape anyway.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Luca said, and there was the older sister in it, the one who used to stand in front of the TV when commercials frightened me and make a puppet out of her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re writing on steel. Don\u2019t sign this without a lawyer.\u201d\n\nNorth had already moved before she spoke. He had a small flashlight, the kind that looks like it should be attached to a keychain but had the attention span of a cathedral. He knelt and peered into the dark of the wheel well, then under the seat where my body had been not-a-solid, then at the floor where the rigging\u2019s shadow had spawned its own system of shadows. He didn\u2019t reach with his fingers at first. He reached with his breath, a steady exhale that fogged surfaces in specific points. It was map-making with lungs.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said finally, voice low not with drama but with respect for whatever he was about to trespass. He slid something thin and reluctant out from the seam between the roll cage and the frame, a piece of plastic no bigger than a fingernail, with a film of adhesive browned by time and engine heat. It was a tag, the kind you use in audits, stamped with a symbol I had only seen lately and in dreams: the half-star, split, the same as on my seal, the same as on the note in my kitchen. In the split, someone had drawn, very carefully with a needle or a thought, a tiny circle like the mouth of a surprised fish.\n\n\u201cI thought the Directory used watermarks,\u201d Luca said. \u201cNot stickers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe use everything,\u201d said a voice I knew, and this time I turned because the acoustics of the warehouse had been warning me two seconds, and because respect requires performance if you\u2019re going to pretend to govern while alive or while adjacent. Alma stood twenty paces away with her hands in her coat pockets, a posture designed to suggest she would not touch anything without permission and to remind you she could. Saffron stood behind her with the specific misery of someone whose job did not include watching a choir assemble in her warehouse. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not the only one who reads our stationery.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me you saved me,\u201d I said, holding the tag between two fingers the way one holds something found in a wound. \u201cYou said you shut it down before it reached the news. Did you shut it down with this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shut it down with a phone call and a bill of lading,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tried to pay out on an accident that hadn\u2019t happened yet. My girls in Accounts don\u2019t like paradox. I don\u2019t like it either. It makes numbers behave like weather. We pulled the footage and put it in an envelope. We licked the envelope closed with spit like the old ways, because the new ways have a worm in them.\u201d She glanced at North with the acknowledgment one instrument gives another in an orchestra pit where they pretend to be strangers. \u201cThe tag is a mischief. Someone wanted a clean chain-of-custody, and someone else wanted to cut the chain and tie it to a different ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour half-star is on my country,\u201d I said. The anger came not in heat but with a clarity the air recognized. \u201cIt\u2019s on the thing that maybe killed me and on the thing you used to recognize me after the fact. I can\u2019t tell whether my jurisdiction ends at my skin or whether you nailed it to my door when I wasn\u2019t home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my half-star,\u201d she said, and for the first time, a small thing in her voice tipped, like a glass bumping another glass at a toast. \u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s. We didn\u2019t invent it. We inherited it from the last era where papers were more powerful than knives. The split means: provisional. The circle in it means: diverted. You have a provisional mark on a thing that wasn\u2019t supposed to be diverted. That means somebody declared you eligible for a cut that did not belong to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cCut,\u201d Brazos said, because he hears cuts in everything, in tape, in frame lines, in throats. \u201cOf what.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf time,\u201d North said, very gently, as if he were telling a scared animal that fences are sometimes just suggestions. \u201cThey took your future and they put it through an editor who had been asked to deliver a different length. They will have had a reason. Reasons are the knives people use when evidence goes sour.\u201d\n\nI slid the tag into my pocket and felt the plastic settle as if I had put a stone in a stream and altered a current that pretended its path had been inevitable. Jonah had been watching us for five minutes, because actors learn to stand behind things and pretend they have just arrived, and when the quiet that followed my pocket\u2019s new weight made a space he could enter without owning it, he entered. He had a paper cup that had been coffee and was now a prop. His face did the thing it does when he has to say something he knows will harm but maybe heal later, which is not a thing he invented for television but a thing television borrowed from his life.\n\n\u201cI told you about the Aegis because the people who murmur in my room wanted me to,\u201d he said, and he didn\u2019t look at Alma because that would have elevated them both in a way he knew better than to do when life was waiting for a punch line. \u201cThey told me not to tell you about the other program because you don\u2019t like programs that are about you as a processing unit. I agree with them. I\u2019m telling you anyway. It\u2019s called Stills.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill as in quiet,\u201d Luca said. \u201cOr still as in leftover. Or still as in the thing you use to make liquor in a place where making liquor is worn like a sin in bright jewelry.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill as in: stop,\u201d Jonah said. \u201cThey arrest moments and they render them potable. They\u2019re a private concern but they post their results like science. They\u2019re the ones who make the tech that can take a face and stretch it six more episodes. They\u2019re the whisper in a writer\u2019s mouth that says: no one will notice if you replace her. If you are a state now, you are a competitor. Countries have their own stills. They call them museums.\u201d\n\nAlma\u2019s mouth flattened into a line that reminded me of a horizon drawn by an exhausted child. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because you would have gone there and broken your skull on their glass,\u201d she said. \u201cNow you will go there and we will go with you and maybe we will break their glass with a bill of lading. I can\u2019t promise you we won\u2019t cut our hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they drink what they make,\u201d North asked, and Alma\u2019s eyes flicked to him with interest, because the question had entered the room like a man who doesn\u2019t knock.\n\n\u201cThey ship,\u201d she said. \u201cThey export. They season their cash with our excuses. And they sell insurance to the people who fear the tide. It\u2019s a good business, fearing the tide. The tide is punctual. It makes its own case.\u201d\n\nWe stood by the car that had been a coffin and then a prop and then a piece of history that refused to pick a lane. I thought of the bathroom mirror where the glass had agreed to act like wind. I thought of the frost grown out of the metal the way grief grows out of bone. I thought of the girl at the end of the row practicing her smile and wanted, very suddenly, to teach her how to practice saying no without turning the sound into a weapon. I thought of the ridiculousness that had taken on shape and gotten stamped: my country, my flag, my anthem that was a hush.\n\n\u201cWhat happens if I walk into Stills as a head of state,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happens if I walk in as a dead woman who has a tongue and a seal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will bring you tea and a clipboard,\u201d Alma said, with a lack of romance that I appreciated the way thirsty people appreciate tap water. \u201cThey will show you a tour where the windows do not look out. They will attempt to make you an offer. They will suggest that the best way to solve your problem is to let professionals frame it. They will be right and wrong in equal measure. And then they will tell you that a provisional recognition can be rescinded with enough signatures. They will point at your flag on news feeds and talk about instability. It will make an excellent headline for a morning panel. Try to look like you enjoy breakfast.\u201d\n\nNorth had moved to the other side of the rig and was standing very still, his hand at head height as if measuring the world. He had a way of stillness that wasn\u2019t an absence but a decision. \u201cSomeone touched this metal with a glove that had powder on it,\u201d he said. \u201cNot shop chalk. A finer dust. Like the stuff they put on hands before glassblowing. They sealed something around you that should have let heat out. It didn\u2019t. It turned the heat into a container and left your outline behind as a draft.\u201d He lowered his hand like a man putting down a book. \u201cWe can follow drafts. But the person who knows how to lay that kind of line learned it from a place that teaches people to move without leaving footprints.\u201d\n\n\u201cStills,\u201d Jonah said, and sorry sat in his voice like a stone in a river, not stopping anything, just altering flow. \u201cOr someone who left their lab and took the lab with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to break their glass,\u201d Luca said. She had picked up a stray bolt from the floor and was rolling it in her palm as if it were thinking. \u201cYou can fog it. You already can. If they built their windows to keep heat in, not out, they might think they\u2019re safe from someone who is a current instead of a wall.\u201d She placed the bolt on the nearby table and pressed her palm next to it. Her skin left a print you could see, the normal human spoor, and where my skin touched an inch away, no print appeared, but when I lifted my hand the condensation clung to the air for a second longer than it should have, like webbing between fingers that weren\u2019t there. \u201cIf they use rooms, use hallways. If they use halls, use stairs. The Interim can be a stairwell. It suits you. You were always better going up than being in a room at the same height.\u201d\n\nWe made a plan the way plans are made by people who do not trust plans. We placed it on a table and stood around it and did not pretend it would survive contact with people. Alma would get us through the front door with the formalities photographers like. North would take us out the back door if the formalities turned carnivorous. Luca would carry the flag and also our common sense. I would stand in the spot the room thought it had laid out for me and then move three inches to the left. You would be surprised how often that knocks a hierarchy onto its keys.\n\nOn the way out, Carlotta texted me a video of the bathroom mirror at Stage E. The glass filmed over with frost and then cleared and then filmed again, like breathing. There was no one in the room. There was no sound. She sent a second text that only said, keep doing your skin care, babe, and a row of snowflakes, her attempt at levity a little jagged around the edges. I sent back a lipstick and a flag because sometimes hieroglyphs are the only currency safe to spend.\n\nWe drove to the Stills compound the way people go to funerals: dressed like a version of themselves that would pass. The building sat in a part of the city that used to be brickyards and is now clean lines and confident glass, the kind of architecture that says: bad things don\u2019t happen here, they happen in places you already decided you don\u2019t live in. The sign on the glass said stills in lowercase and kindness in the font you use to sell oat milk. Inside, the air smelled like a dentist\u2019s office where the fillings tell you stories if you bother to ask. A woman at the desk asked for my name and then performed surprise like a professional, which is not a criticism. You do what you\u2019re paid to do.\n\n\u201cCustodian Leland,\u201d she said, and the word custodian nearly made me smile because of the mop joke and because it felt like a word that might behave if you told it a bedtime story. \u201cWe\u2019re honored. We weren\u2019t informed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither were we,\u201d Alma said, which was true in a way that could be papered over easily later. \u201cWe\u2019re here to see your director. Tell them the Interim is visiting. Tell them we\u2019re willing to be bored if the boredom comes with access. Tell them we brought our own tea.\u201d\n\nThe receptionist blinked like a modem trying to decide whether it was necessary to make noise. She made a call. She made another call. Two men appeared wearing the clothes of people who exercise to keep the devil out. They said words like welcome and transparency and oversight and you\u2019re safe here, which are words that have had the varnish rubbed off them by hands all over the world. The lobby had no corners and no plants. The light came from nowhere you could point at. It was an honest trick.\n\nThey put us in a conference room where the glass was two-way, no matter what they believed they had bought. The table was a shade that would not mar under cutlery, and in the center a low bowl held stones that were meant to look like river stones, except none of them had the interesting flaws carburetors leave when water ragged with history moves through machinery. The door shut with a hush that had money in it.\n\nA woman came in with a suit fitted like a sentence diagram. She held her head the way you do when you have learned you can stop headaches by walking properly. She said her name was Magdalene Pike and shook my hand without flinching, which I gave her points for even if the points didn\u2019t count in the game we were playing. Her palm was the temperature of rooms in museums where they keep the small paintings that soldiers hid in barns. You never forget the way that kind of climate control feels.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Stills,\u201d she said. \u201cYou raised a flag. Congratulations. We like flags. They clarify the air. You\u2019re going to ask me about the flip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you about a sticker,\u201d I said, laying the tag on the table like a coin you put down in a bar when you are about to make trouble and would prefer to frame it as commerce. \u201cWhich of your programs uses this mark.\u201d\n\nShe smiled very slightly, the mouth equivalent of a rubber band around a bundle of papers to keep them neat. \u201cWe consult for many programs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe inherit symbols as often as we invent them. That mark indicates that something has been protected while its ownership is resolved. It is a kindness we apply when people panic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very soothed,\u201d Luca said, sitting back as if about to recount a recipe to a woman who had never owned salt. \u201cWhen you protect something, who decides when it is no longer protected. Who decides where you put it after you\u2019re done protecting it. Who gets the key to the lockbox when you go out of business or become a tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t go out of business,\u201d Pike said. \u201cWe change business. And we consult the proper authorities. The Directory is one. The Courts of Account are another. Your Choir, Ms. Leland, are particularly fond of advisory votes, which we find charming. It is nice when civic bodies perform their arithmetic aloud. So many numbers prefer to be whispered.\u201d\n\nAlma watched her with the hospitality you offer a neighbor you will one day need to borrow a ladder from. \u201cYou had a woman and a laminate at our set,\u201d she said. \u201cYou had a glove with dust meant for glass. You have a habit of moving grief to warehouses where it can be measured and then sold back to the family at a discount. I can\u2019t stop you from building your rooms. I can ask you to tell us who asked you to build yours around my girl.\u201d\n\nPike did a small elegant thing with her eyes that was not a roll and not a blink and not a wink. It was the gesture people do when they tug a thread in their own weave to see if it will hold. \u201cYour girl is an adult,\u201d she said. \u201cShe engages with risk for money. She knows the cost of exposure. We all do, in our ways. We had a client who requested that in the event of an accident at your location, all expressive assets be retained for review. The request came to us stamped with a half-star. We accepted the request. We held. The client rescinded before we had developed a plan. We released your assets into the wild. They returned to you. We never even wrote an invoice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho,\u201d North said, and the word did not carry a threat, only the weight of any question a person asks at a door, and sometimes doors answer because politeness is a code older than laws.\n\n\u201cThe client designated themselves as an intermediary for a consortium,\u201d Pike said. \u201cYou know their type. People who love to sit above a pool of voices and call it a decision. The name on the remit was R. Kincaid. The money came from a fund called Weather. There\u2019s a contact address here.\u201d She slid a card across the table that was not a card but a scrap of paper cut from larger paper, torn on one short side and smelling faintly of eucalyptus and ink dried quickly to avoid fingerprints. \u201cWe do not enjoy conflict with governments. We prefer to sell them extra minutes and sell the fruit water that makes the minutes easier to swallow. You came here as a state. We will treat you as one. Please don\u2019t pass resolutions under my roof. It scuffs.\u201d\n\nI picked up the scrap and folded it once. The act made the air tilt. North\u2019s head turned half a degree as if something in the room had moved that wasn\u2019t furniture. Through the glass, two drones paused mid-flight and realized they had been told to wait. The bowl of stones looked theatrical for the first time, like props in a play about a river that refused to be on time.\n\n\u201cWe will not vandalize your lobby,\u201d I said. \u201cWe will pay for the tea we did not drink. We will take our sticker and our half-star and our circle and our problem, and we will go outside and fight in the way that does not attract security. If we need a tour, we will ask for one and pretend to enjoy the windows.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Pike said. \u201cWhen you have found the person who made the request, you may discover that they had a reason you approve of. It happens all the time. That is why we keep our empathy in small bottles. It makes dosing easier.\u201d\n\nIn the elevator down, the music made a small apology for not being music. Luca was folding the scrap into smaller and smaller squares the way she does when she wants to make an idea occupy less space in her pocket. Alma leaned her head against the mirror and for a second her smile scratched the silver backing and left a mark that wouldn\u2019t buff out. North closed his eyes and said a direction under his breath so quietly I almost didn\u2019t catch it.\n\n\u201cSouth,\u201d he said, and I laughed because it was a relief to have a joke sneak in through a gap the room had left by accident. The elevator stopped at a floor we hadn\u2019t chosen and opened on a corridor that did not belong to a building that had been put on the permit application. The carpet was office neutral, the kind that forgives coffee and rage. The air was the gray of a thought someone had been told not to finish. It was an annex. It made sense that it would be here, because anything that profits from arrested time will build a hallway you cannot schedule.\n\n\u201cWe are not in your house,\u201d Alma said, and the we covered more than the bodies in the elevator. \u201cAre we in mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a door between,\u201d North said. \u201cInterim territory. You can set flags here if you are fast. The people who like to own thresholds hate it when you collect tolls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no tolls,\u201d Luca said. \u201cWe have taxes forgiven upon evidence of sincerity.\u201d\n\n\u201cTolls are a kind of test,\u201d North murmured, and the muscles in his jaw made a decision that had nothing to do with teeth.\n\nI stepped out of the elevator because in the end what I am good at is stepping out onto things in front of witnesses. The corridor felt like standing inside my bathroom mirror when it had decided to try being wind. The wall on the left had a door marked Weather, and the door had a pinhole camera in it that did not blink when we moved. The smell coming from under it was coin and rosemary and the faint singe of a filament bulb about to fail.\n\n\u201cDo we knock,\u201d Luca said, and the question was real and not, the way a childhood friend\u2019s hand on yours before you jump from the bridge is real and not.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s for houses. This is a cut.\u201d\n\nI pressed my palm to the door and watched frost write itself in a script I had not learned but recognized. Behind the door, someone who had smiled earlier without moving their face moved. I could feel it the way you can feel the weather decide.\n\n\u201cCustodian,\u201d said a voice that had spent its life surviving and winning quiet auctions. \u201cInterim is not a state. It\u2019s a mood.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoods pass,\u201d I said, and kept my hand where it was until the cold agreed we were in a negotiation. \u201cWe make ours a place. We brought a stamp.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first time the air bent around you, you learned to lie for an audience,\u201d the voice said, and I did not have to look at Luca to know she was about to break someone\u2019s window. \u201cTry not to lie to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou killed me,\u201d I said, and it came out not as accusation but as homework. \u201cOr you tried to. Or you bent the power of trying in the direction of my absence. Use your words.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe rescued you from an ending you had not earned and replaced it with one you could use,\u201d the voice said, and the room made a microscopic sound that could have been a laugh or could have been a building\u2019s idea of a shrug. \u201cYou are better now. You are interesting. We take nothing without leaving something behind. It\u2019s theology. It\u2019s commerce.\u201d\n\nAlma\u2019s breath cut the air like a ribbon. \u201cOpen your door,\u201d she said, and I didn\u2019t know if I had ever heard anyone be so gracious while starting a war. \u201cOr I will condemn your corridor as a fire hazard in fourteen jurisdictions and your board will have to hold their next meeting in the parking lot.\u201d\n\nThe lock clicked the way a small animal does when it realizes the hand reaching for it has food and teeth. The door opened on a room that had been designed to photograph well at every angle. A person sat behind a desk that could have been salvaged from a ship or bought yesterday; a woman with hair in a bun that had done philosopher\u2019s work; a window beyond her that looked out on nothing we could name. The plaque on the desk said KINCAID, and beside it lay a bowl of wax that had ruined gold waiting on its surface, a patient mirror of my own.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty,\u201d Kincaid said to me, but the adjective had nothing to do with faces. It had to do with shapes that fit inside systems and still spill a little. \u201cThat\u2019s inconvenient for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cConvenience is not in our anthem,\u201d I said, and my hand had print on it now, something like chalk and colder than bone. \u201cYou tagged me. You held me. You released me. I want the chain you cut. I want the names that stood behind yours when you signed. I want the lesson plan you wrote about what happens when a thing you\u2019ve filed tries to breathe.\u201d\n\nKincaid looked at the seal in my hand and smiled, this time with her face, and you could see why someone had put her behind a desk and asked her to pretend the world liked desks. \u201cCustodian,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you take dictation.\u201d",

                              "content": "Kincaid\u2019s question lay on the desk like a blade turned sideways, not cutting yet, only consenting to be noticed. Dictation is not a neutral instrument. In the old cities, the clerk who took it was the person the room agreed to remember, and memory has always been a kind of crown. Luca\u2019s hand went to her pocket without looking, found a pen with teeth marks and a small notebook she used for recipes and enemies. She put them on the desk beside the bowl of wax as if she were laying out implements for surgery and dessert.\n\n\u201cI take dictation,\u201d she said, and her tone did not ask permission. \u201cI have witnesses. I have a seal. I am not an officer of your company and therefore my page is unbuyable. If you dictate, you will be read.\u201d\n\nAlma didn\u2019t sit, which was her way of being generous to a chair. North did sit and became so still the air seemed to practice around him. You learn that in hospitals; you learn it in prisons; you learn it in holes. Kincaid tipped her head the way people who have met dogs do when they prepare their hand and their scent and their posture not to startle. She reached for the wax bowl, dipped her finger and thumb, and pressed a smear on the edge of Luca\u2019s notebook like a signature translated into texture.\n\n\u201cFor the Minutes of the Interim,\u201d she said calmly, and the words made the room decide to become a courtroom for exactly the length of a heartbeat. \u201cChain-of-custody on asset LE-ML-772413, request received by Weather on day 209 of fiscal cycle. Mark applied: half-star, provisional; circle indicating diversion authority. Intermediary: R. Kincaid, empowered by five signatures under the Accounts in Precaution charter. Upstream pool: consortium named River & Hedge, constituents redacted by their own agreement but containing entities you do business with when you buy billboard space in Nice. Instruction: In the event of catastrophic interruption of expressive output, freeze and retain residual until ownership clarified. Trigger: compliance notice from studio counsel indicating a stunt escalation not documented in the original risk plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudio counsel,\u201d I said, and the words stood on their own and did not fall. The stunt escalation had been a rumor, like a hawk shadow. We had not escalated. Brazos would sooner eat film than escalate without ceremony.\n\nKincaid kept her eyes on Luca\u2019s hand. \u201cThe escalation was fake,\u201d she said. \u201cSo was the compliance notice. A laminate that looked laminated twice, as Brazos would say, for a double gloss of legitimacy. We are not fools, but we are practiced at believing paper that smells like our paper. The request was pre-cleared; it had the Directory on it in a signature we have seen in less operatic contexts. It had a Choir watermark that may have been laid by a printer bought from us and tuned by your people. We applied the tag to the environment, not the person, which is how we behave when we are good. We did not touch your flesh. We altered the chamber around it so that heat would not write a new story without our note at the bottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour glove,\u201d North said, and his own hands remained on his knees, palms up the way you sit when you are prepared to receive an object that might bite.\n\n\u201cThe glove belongs to a toolroom that hires to many houses,\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cStills uses it. So do forensic photographers. So do glassblowers. So do people who salvage stained glass from blown churches. If you want to be angry\u2014and I encourage civic anger in modest doses\u2014be angry at the way a tool learns pass-phrases by passing through hands. Be angry at the man in gray. You will say his name is generic and I will say generic is a color and many uniforms wear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemit was rescinded,\u201d Alma said, each verb a fencepost. \u201cThe call was mine. Your people answered. They had already made their little room. They like to make rooms; it makes them feel like city planners. I told them I would requisition their minutes for a hearing and they very politely told me I could requisition their ashes. You released the mark because you like to avoid hearings. Name your price for collaborating with a government and surviving the paperwork with your nails intact.\u201d\n\nKincaid smiled with her whole mouth and let herself be seen enjoying the taste of the word survive. \u201cYou like to act as if we live off indemnity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t. We live off the way mornings line up in people\u2019s heads. Our clients panic when mornings tangle. We sell them combs. Sometimes we sell them a haircut. In your case, we were prepared to sell you time. We decided not to when we realized you would be better at selling it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho authorized the hold,\u201d I said. \u201cNot in title. In person. I want a name I can stand in front of. It can be a first name. It can be the name a mother uses when she wants to stop a child from sticking a fork into a socket. If you are about to say R. Kincaid, decide whether you prefer to be interesting or consistent.\u201d\n\nLuca\u2019s pen made a sound that writing makes when it knows it is about to be quoted at a conference later. Kincaid looked at me the way one judge looks at another across a feast where no one has eaten yet. \u201cThe Directory\u2019s signature came from a person who has always believed in provisional instruments,\u201d she said softly, and she let Alma see the softness because soft can be used as a solvent. \u201cI do not know if she wrote it or if her pen did. The name on the Directory line was Anahi Cuevas.\u201d\n\nThe name blew through the room as if someone had opened a valve in the past. I had been carrying Anahi around in my pocket since I put my hand in and found a seal. I knew the shape of her vowels without having met their owner, because some people become grammar before they are saints. Alma did not change color. None of her changed. The change was the room\u2019s. The air recognized an old song and wished it had learned the harmony.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d she said. It qualified as a courtesy. It gives a person a second chance to do something less clumsy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dictating,\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cYou can staple it to my notice board. Anahi\u2019s hand has been on our requisitions for small things for years. It\u2019s practical\u2014small things get things done. We assumed she had extended her remit because your house had sprung a leak. We applied your mop. We intended to file cleanly. Then the call came; it wasn\u2019t hers. It was yours. We undid our own ribbon. We barely had time to write a notation: \u2018Diversion reversed by Choir\u2014defer.\u2019 If you think the man in gray cared about our notation, you haven\u2019t been to a room like the one he uses. He wasn\u2019t our tool. He was someone else\u2019s following a map we didn\u2019t draw.\u201d\n\nLuca wrote the words defer and reversed and then drew a small flag beside them the way children decorate their margins when the body wants to do something that isn\u2019t sitting. I watched Alma\u2019s mouth for signs of regret and saw none. She doesn\u2019t wear regret where people can match it with fabric. She stores it under floorboards and burns it late.\n\n\u201cIf Anahi\u2019s hand is on that paper, it is because she built the mechanism that gets water to the fires before the neighbors notice the smell,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cWe assign our people authority and then we live with it. Sometimes they use it in ways we didn\u2019t discuss at the last soup. Sometimes they use it so perfectly the room thinks it designed itself. I will find out which this is. You won\u2019t do it for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not find her,\u201d Kincaid said, and allowed herself a kindness I did not expect from her face. \u201cShe is at a distance from all of us on purpose. It makes her work keep working even when we remember to tie our shoes.\u201d\n\nNorth lifted his head by a half-inch. He hears distances the way other men hear flirtation. \u201cDead,\u201d he said gently, which was not a question but the kind of flinch a person makes for another person. Kincaid\u2019s eyes danced over his face like moths trying to decide if a light is a lamp or a trap.\n\n\u201cAbsent,\u201d she said. \u201cUnavailable. In governance, those are different words. In grief, they are not.\u201d\n\nLuca closed the notebook around the wax smear with a small decisive snap. \u201cDictation noted,\u201d she said. \u201cYour bowl smells like rosemary. Your company smells like coins. Your name smells like rain you promised and delivered on people who did not ask for it. We\u2019ll take the scrap and the sticker and the absence and go file a complaint against a color.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore you do,\u201d Kincaid said, and she reached into the drawer where good pens live and took out something that looked like a business card and smelled like the inside of a violin case, \u201cconsider an offer. Not a rescue. Not a haircut. A contract between your Interim and our Weather. We\u2019re tired of the met\u00e0, the thing we built to persuade investors that weather is a product. You just raised a flag over the time between. Co-govern it with us. You put your stamp on days when the air bends. We pay you to host our minutes when they pertain to people who live in the in-betweens. You become the ledger. When they come for you, the paperwork fights back.\u201d\n\nAlma bristled like an animal consulting a map of fences. \u201cShe is not your compliance arm,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is not your fig leaf. She is a person who can run a country without land like some of us run rooms without walls. You do not get to plant a mailbox in her mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlma,\u201d I said, and it surprised both of us. \u201cDo you tell me to say no because you are protecting me or because you want your Choir to keep all the songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe distinction is bureaucratic,\u201d she said wryly. \u201cAnd boring. Say no because you are not finished with your yes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain the clarity that arrives when the room decides you\u2019re in charge. It\u2019s not ego. It\u2019s an adjustment in the way corners behave. The bowl of stones on the conference table next door remembered they were not river stones; the two men in exercise clothes adjusted their weight onto their heels like cops instructed to be polite; the receptionist downstairs thought hard about the habit of standing when a woman with a flag walks past and practiced it without moving. I put the card from Kincaid in my pocket because you don\u2019t turn down a bridge before you know which valley you will have to jump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use your minutes,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to use our name. You do not put Interim on your prospectus. You will send us notices you would usually bury in footers. I will read them aloud. I am very good at reading aloud.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend us any paper with a half-star,\u201d Luca added. \u201cWe have strong feelings about geometry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend them through me,\u201d Alma said, because songs travel in braids backstage.\n\nKincaid stood, and the room remembered desks had been designed to make people stand to gain power. She came around the desk with the sympathetic tilt of a person who\u2019s seen horses balk at bridges and learned to take a step first so the animal feels invited. She held out her hand again, and I gave her mine because my whole job is pretending palms can agree to what mouths have promised. Her skin was careful. \u201cThe person who grayed your day,\u201d she said, so low that only the paper heard and perhaps the bowl of wax, \u201cused to sweep floors at Stills and learned more from silence than our engineers learn from grants. He calls himself Halberd if he has to answer in rooms with windows. He will change the name by noon. He reads the immunities list like other men read love poems. He will try to make you accept that death is a version. He will be wrong, but he will be persuasive. Don\u2019t hire him. He\u2019ll be better at the job than your own heart.\u201d\n\nNorth breathed in once as if the shape of the air had contained that name and had been waiting to lay it down in him. Luca tucked the sound away with other small sounds she would use later like tools. Alma put her hands back in her pockets and the pockets sighed with relief.\n\nWe left Weather without anyone escorting us, which in that kind of building is the only courtesy you trust. In the annex corridor, the carpet looked closer to brown than gray, which felt like a win. The elevator was waiting with its apology music and its ambition to close quickly. We rode down like a box of fragile things teaching itself to be stone.\n\nOutside, the sky had the color of a public swimming pool after a rainstorm. Drones did their sibling orbit. A street vendor sold oranges the way church ladies sell salvation, quickly, to people who didn\u2019t know they were hungry. The flag of Interim on my apartment had become a template a few neighborhoods over; someone else had raised it with a white ribbon through the blue-gray, and the line wavered like a sincere hand. The city decided that when bands don\u2019t know a song they can still keep time, and so tires hummed and buses hissed and a child yelled at a pigeon and refused to say sorry.\n\nDax called before Alma said anything mean about Kincaid\u2019s eyebrows. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. He doesn\u2019t say hello because his language is a theater where he\u2019s already in act two when he arrives. \u201cThe rumor machine is producing cotton candy. You went to Stills. Your flag is a filter. You\u2019re bleeding fans into governance, which is weird branding but apparently plays in kitchens. If you\u2019re going to make a statement, do it with a cup in your hand. People trust a droplet. Smile like you\u2019re cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to act for that,\u201d I said. \u201cWe met their Weather. We got a name.\u201d I told him about Halberd with the caution you use when you tell someone about a person who looks like a concept from far away and like a hand at your throat from here.\n\nDax didn\u2019t pause. He is always feeding a spreadsheet hidden under the seat of his car. \u201cWe\u2019ll get three conflicting Halberds by morning,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cOne will be a drummer; one will be a gym; one will be a grant application. In the meantime, don\u2019t call him. Let him find you. People who change their names like to test their work.\u201d He inhaled with that carefulness men have when they are weighing whether to step over a threshold their paycheck did not cover. \u201cMira,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re fine if you\u2019re dead. We can sell that. We\u2019re also fine if you\u2019re a country. We can sell that. Please don\u2019t get in the middle of a regulatory reform round with a company that underwrites stadiums. It\u2019s ungenteel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am literally the State of the Middle,\u201d I said, and he sighed and hung up and texted me three gifs of flags he thought were pretty, each uglier than the last and each with a color named after money.\n\nWe stood on the sidewalk and committed the old civic sin of blocking pedestrian traffic while being interesting. North touched my elbow with the appraising lightness a tailor uses. \u201cDo you want a street,\u201d he said, almost shy, and when I looked at him, his eyes were a language I could not name and had no trouble reading. \u201cSometimes when people have flags they need streets. We can draw one. It won\u2019t stay all day. It will be there as long as people believe they can cross without being hit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should ask Saffron for permission,\u201d Luca said, looking up at a sky that had opinions and a day that might change them. \u201cShe likes to say yes to rules that feel like rules. We\u2019ll call it a pop-up ceremony and tell the drones before we tell the people.\u201d\n\nAlma had been watching the door of the building, not because she expected pursuit but because professionals always look at the place trouble comes from even when they know trouble doesn\u2019t need doors. \u201cHe\u2019ll test you before dusk,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll choose a place you think you own. He\u2019ll try to close it around you the way he closed heat around your bones. He expects you to push. Don\u2019t push. Permission and apology are architecture. You know it; use it.\u201d\n\nWe drew a street on the asphalt with the kind of chalk sold to children and municipal workers. North knelt and drew a line that did not wobble even when bus brakes exhaled nearby. He took the chalk and made it leave marks where chalk behaves badly: on paint, on the slick patches where oil courts dust, on the place where rain had dried and left a map of a bay. He drew a border that was two lines with breathing room between them. He wrote: INTERIM, in letters a child would like because they could trace them. Luca stood at one end and raised the broom-handle flag, and the fabric learned the wind of a street like a dance partner you can trust to lead once and follow twice.\n\nWe didn\u2019t make a speech. We put down the bowl of ruined-gold wax on the curb and let people look at it if they wanted. A woman with hands like a teacher\u2019s touched the seal and did not flinch because she has daughters. A courier on a bike swore very politely in two languages and then went around us. A boy in a sweatshirt that said NOT A PHASE took a picture and sent it to someone who would send him three exclamation points and a heart. The air noticed. It bent; it adjusted; it consented to carry a new sign.\n\nHe came to us on foot, not because he was humble but because cars make noise, and men like him prefer rooms to take the credit for their arrival. He wore a suit that was committed to gray the way certain mushrooms are committed to wood. His face was the kind you forget until you see it again and then your memory tries to file it under trap or cousin. He carried nothing in his hands and too much in his shoulders. In another life he kept night schedules for a factory where the lights pretended to be dawn for the sake of flesh. North straightened not defensively but as a man who has recognized a mountain in clouds.\n\n\u201cHalberd,\u201d I said, because I have learned the trick of using a name as a rope.\n\nHe smiled with something that did not quite reach the walk back of his mouth. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s for the rooms that need weapons to keep people from sitting too long. Call me Howell. That\u2019s today\u2019s version. It wears well and it looks good on a mailbox. You\u2019ve drawn a beautiful street. It looks like a game children play when they are teaching a yard to obey.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren do not teach yards,\u201d Luca said. \u201cThey invite them. The acceptance is labor. Don\u2019t belittle labor in this house.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged her with a nod like someone stamping paper he didn\u2019t write. His eyes told me he knew both of us well enough to have learned the difference between politeness and hospitality, and chose politeness because it stains less. He took a step onto the chalk. Chalk is inexpensive; it offers very little resistance; it is a boundary beloved of people who do not enjoy blood. The moment his shoe crossed the line, the air did a small trick with its own gravity, and he had to adjust his weight, which he did like someone who grew up on boats.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t build traps,\u201d he said. \u201cTraps suggest you know what the thing you\u2019re catching will look like when you catch it. I build rooms. Rooms are honest. They announce themselves as boundaries. They persuade by offering shelter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sealed a girl into a heatless box,\u201d North said, and the tenderness in his voice made the sentence heavier than anger would have. \u201cYou built her a shelter that was also a coffin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe built a pause,\u201d Howell said. \u201cShe was on fire. Everything she touched belonged to other people. The car, the harness, the camera, the insurance policy. Her breath belonged to three platforms and an offshore trust. She was going to die very publicly and it would have been a mess, and I hate mess. We turned the room down. We took her heat and stored it. We gave it back. Look at her; your duct taster rescued her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou put your tag in our rig like a fisherman who releases a fish and then surprises the lake,\u201d Brazos said from beside the curb, and I hadn\u2019t seen him come up because good men with rope hands can arrive without shame or preamble. \u201cDo you plan to build walls at my funerals too, or do you prefer your wakes private.\u201d\n\nHowell\u2019s smile didn\u2019t approve and didn\u2019t not. It was adjudication and it was habit. \u201cIf I built rooms at funerals they would be beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople would thank me for the light.\u201d He turned to me and tilted his head the way a buyer does when he is not quite sure how much the thing is worth and is excited to find out. \u201cWalk with me. Your street will hold. I promise not to poach your minutes.\u201d\n\nHe was right about the street. It held, not because chalk is strong but because belief is. Belief is a species of weight. We walked to the end, past the flag that was behaving like fabric aware of choreography, past the wax bowl catching dust like a sacrament. He kept his hands visible, which was a kindness. Men who build boundaries can evade where they hide an edge.\n\n\u201cYou died,\u201d he said, not as a triumph, and not as a threat, and he had the luck to say it like someone confessing to a natural disaster. \u201cIt was quick. It was not a horror. There is footage you will never watch because you are not a ghoul. We had you for fifty-seven minutes. We failed to keep you because your Choir arrived with a better story. We let you go. You went. What you brought back isn\u2019t what most people bring back. Most people bring back a visible limp. You brought back a jurisdiction. That is annoying. It is also interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou changed the math,\u201d I said. \u201cYou wrote a grammar on top of a day and expected no one to notice because you used one of the old alphabets. When I put my hand on the mirror, it wrote back. That is your handwriting. I felt the chalk in your glove. Why me. You have other cars. You have other mouths. What did you intend to do with my heat. Sell it in vials to people who fear losing their cheeks on camera.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged like a bridge that knows it is sound. \u201cWe planned to pour it into your catalog. Not yours alone. They bought the option to season your archive with you. You would have made them a fortune from beyond. We would have taken our tithe and funded a library. You think we are villains. We are bookkeepers with a flair for weather. Your dying tidy and coming home untidy ruins our margins. It undoes an elegant plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe elegant plan had my sister crying on a ceramic floor,\u201d Luca said, and her voice had the varnish ripped off. \u201cIf you come within ten feet of our kitchen again I will show you what a flag is for when we\u2019re not playing at ceremonies.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her with the respectful patience men show to threats they will put on a shelf and dust. \u201cApologies,\u201d he said, and North made a tiny approving sound, because apology is a key and Howell had found the right pocket for it. \u201cYour kitchen is yours. Your sister\u2019s breath is hers unless she sells it, which she has done like all of us who forgot our first mouths. Custodian,\u201d he added, switching registers like a linguist, \u201chere is a gift, because gifts entangle and I like a crowd. There is a person in your Choir who will tell you they signed because someone had to keep the paper from going to the worst house. They are right and wrong at once. Indoor women always are. If you approach them with a knife, they will convince you it\u2019s a butter spreader and you will end up feeding each other toast. If you approach with a bowl, they will fill it. Decide which breakfast you prefer.\u201d\n\n\u201cNames,\u201d I said, because I can be rude when it matters and when it doesn\u2019t. \u201cWith vowels.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t smile that time. He considered the wax bowl on the curb the way people consider wishing wells. \u201cThey taught me to call her Sparrow,\u201d he said finally. \u201cThat is not a name; it is a license. In the Directory she is not there, which tells you everything. Find her in places people put constructs to make rooms work better. She will be where elevators decide to stop for breath. She will be in signs. You will know her by the way printers jam when she stands near them. She is Anahi\u2019s apprentice and substitute and sometimes shadow. She eats paper when it makes her nervous and leaves the corners soft.\u201d\n\nAlma said a word in another language that was probably used by women in kitchens when the cupboards began to sprout clever mice. It wasn\u2019t a curse; it was a reminder of what to take off the shelf next. \u201cMy Sparrow is not yours,\u201d she said to Howell. \u201cIf you have touched her, I will raise a bridge under your building and make you live politely above a river you didn\u2019t order.\u201d\n\nHe bowed, as much to hospitality as to threat. \u201cWe don\u2019t recruit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe beckon. She didn\u2019t come. She likes being essential too much to join a house that calls itself a product. Custodian, you will get your murderer by Thursday if you go at him like a person who wants to fix something she broke. If you go as a queen, he will break a different thing and make you decide whether the Interim collects taxes after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will you do,\u201d North asked, not unkindly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get to keep your pause. You lost your invoice. Men like you mind invoices more than blood.\u201d\n\nHowell\u2019s face softened briefly into the man who, in another era, would have liked to fix radios for his neighbors. \u201cI will do what I always do,\u201d he said. \u201cBuild rooms where people have to say what they mean to get out. And then I will go somewhere with weather and pretend I feel it.\u201d\n\nHe stepped off our chalk with the respect a person reserves for a stranger\u2019s grave. He walked away with the speed of a man who has put an end to conversation in a way that leaves everyone feeling they got their portion. The street filled with noise again, which is the sound of peace if you squint. The flag looked content; flags do, briefly, when they\u2019ve been used properly.\n\nWe stood as people came and went around us and pretended not to memorize our faces. Luca poured a little of the wax onto the edge of the chalk line and pressed the seal into it, and the half-star took. The impression looked odd on asphalt, like a signature on a mountain. North leaned close to the mark and breathed on it as if he were putting a baby to sleep. The wax cooled. It did not flake.\n\n\u201cWe have a Sparrow,\u201d Alma said dryly. \u201cOf course we do. She would have been tucked under my arm this whole time like a catalog if she weren\u2019t halfway smoke. We\u2019ll call elevators. We\u2019ll find out which ones skip floor twelve when she is tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask Carlotta,\u201d I said. \u201cShe knows the places where paper gathers and goes to gossip. She also knows who eats anxiety for breakfast and calls it fiber.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall Jonah,\u201d Luca said. \u201cHe will know a Sparrow by posture. He has acted sparrows since he was twelve. He has made a vocation of tiny bones.\u201d\n\nWe went home because plans look better on kitchen tables. Home smelled like rosemary and ruined gold and the soft drink that only exists when tea cools in a room you are not in. The flag we had left in the window had learned to lift and lay itself down like breathing. On my counter the Directory had selected a page to be open when I arrived, which is a trick I didn\u2019t know paper could do even in a house like mine. The page had sections I hadn\u2019t seen earlier, or maybe my eyes had not known how to assemble them. It read: Clerks of Interim: Luca Leland (kin), attested. Aegis: North, Adjunct, provisional to prime upon first successful diversion avoidance. Advisory: Choir liaison Alma R.\u2014the surname had fallen through a crack and not been caught; I don\u2019t ask paper for everything. Below that, in a smaller hand that was neither mine nor Alma\u2019s, a line: Note the existence of Sparrow. Do not feed crumbs.\n\nThe doorbell did not ring. It sighed. The building\u2019s lungs announced someone who knew how to step in and out of jurisdiction without making it an affront. The corridor had the smugness of a dog that knows it has done the trick. Luca went to the door and opened it without turning on the screen. A woman stood there wearing a yellow cardigan the color of a legal pad in sunlight, hair gathered into a coil that had once been done in a hurry and then learned to stay. She held a sandwich wrapped in brown paper and a folder the color of sky before storm. Her eyes had smudges under them not because she had forgotten to sleep but because she had remembered not to.\n\n\u201cI like elevators,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do not enjoy it when they like me back too much. May I come in. The birds in your street told me to say please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are more on the nose than we are accustomed to,\u201d Alma said, and the smile that leaked from her was proud and infuriated. \u201cSparrow, if that\u2019s the license you\u2019re paying taxes under, meet the Interim. Interim, this is what happens when a Choir lets its instruments walk around without a case.\u201d\n\nSparrow looked at me and saw all the wrongs and the rights and did not arrange them. She didn\u2019t look at North because she could feel him like you feel a plumb line even if you\u2019re not a builder, and her head moved a fraction in his direction the way plants move at night. She held out the sandwich to Luca because she knows how to meet sisters.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t sign your paper,\u201d she said, and her voice had the rasp of a printer forced to keep working because the office needed four more copies of something it pretended not to care about. \u201cI stamped it. There\u2019s a difference. I am not the murderer. I am the person who wrote the tidy condolence you would have received, with your good pictures and the fund for stunt coordinator training allocations at the bottom to assuage the part of us that can be soothed by a check. I have good hands. You see why we hide.\u201d\n\nLuca took the sandwich because she is a serious person. \u201cYou stamped what, exactly,\u201d she said. \u201cSay it properly. We take dictation.\u201d\n\nSparrow did not flinch at the wax bowl. She touched the seal as if it were a pet. \u201cProvisional diversion,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI signed because the other signatures were inevitable and I preferred our house to be allowed to look inside the box. We didn\u2019t put the box there. We didn\u2019t agree with the box. We like to inspect. You should thank me. You can also put my head on a platter; I have seen it done with smaller crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho sent the man in gray,\u201d I asked. \u201cWho taped the paper on the call sheet and who slipped glass dust into a glove and who slept well after.\u201d\n\nSparrow put the folder on the table and opened it. It contained what people like to call nothing: five receipts with the last lines whited out, three photographs of a rig that had been a different rig three months ago, three copies of the same email with different times stamped on top as the server tried to decide how to line them up, and one small piece of paper cut from something larger with a circle drawn in the center so carefully the pen had not bled. In the circle, someone had written: Weather is a mood. People should be permitted moods. You will be paid for this mood.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find a person,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find a room. The room is a cooperative of men who like import duties paid in trust. They call themselves the Silent Studio when they are being disgusting. They own nothing. They advise horizon lines. You\u2019ve been in rooms like that. Sometimes they are useful. Usually they are where breakfasts go to learn to be dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a name,\u201d Alma said. \u201cWe have a half-dozen names. We have a Consultant of Gray who uses Howell as his Tuesday hat. We have you and your stamp. We have my Anahi\u2019s habit of understanding the part under the law where the law keeps its keys. We will go to their room and we will sing at a pitch that makes their glass nervous. Custodian, either you sleep or you change your shoes. Either way, put the kettle on. Every government worth its salt knows the value of a cup before a war.\u201d\n\nI put the kettle on because the house expected it and because the noise fills the space where fear would otherwise sit and practice. Sparrow took off her cardigan because she is practical and because she understands the temperature in our kitchen is not for everyone. North stood by the window and looked not at the flag but at its shadow on the wall, which is a habit men get when they learn to trust signs cast more than signs flown. Luca got out plates because she will never permit a sandwich to be eaten over a sink like shame. I looked at the page where the Directory had added lines in my absence and traced with my finger the words that made me feel like a verb: Custodian, Witness, Adjunct, Liaison.\n\n\u201cI died,\u201d I said, not to anyone and to everyone, as you do when a truth has to be arranged into the room the way furniture has to be arranged after a party. \u201cAnd now I govern. You built a box for me and I got out. We all did things we will finish repenting for when no one is looking. There is a room where men call themselves a studio. There is a man who calls himself a tool. There is a ghost who calls herself an absence so the people who need her can keep standing. There is a name carved into the bottom of my seal that makes every decision feel like the next chapter in a book someone started on a bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in chapter five,\u201d Luca said briskly, cutting the sandwich like it was a treaty. \u201cIf we survive to chapter eight I will buy a rug.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t ask what chapter eight would be. I poured tea and thought of the way the frost writes itself when the metal remembers being ore. Sparrow smiled like a printer given good paper. Alma took the first cup because she likes to set the tone. North stood very close to the line the shadow of the flag made and watched it move with the concentration a man reserves for fires. Somewhere outside a siren declared itself useful and then decided not to come down our street. It understood chalk. You could tell.",

                              "content": "We ate Sparrow\u2019s sandwich with the gravity of sacrament because it is good policy to fortify yourself before walking into rooms that like to pretend you\u2019re not a person. The bread had seeds that got into our teeth and made us look like we were trying to germinate opinions, and Sparrow nodded at our chewing the way a clerk nods at a stamp behaving on damp paper. She had brought the folder because folders are how her kind say I love you, and she watched the way our hands moved over it the way birders watch wind. Alma unfolded a city schedule out of nowhere and found a margin where time could be borrowed; she said, in the tone of a conductor pretending she is only a passenger, that we would hold our hearing somewhere that understood being between. We picked the freight elevator bank at the old municipal annex because it is the place where floors consider one another, where scooters pause, and where heat from stories above meets cold from stories below and has to shake hands.\n\nDax\u2019s bullet list arrived like hail in my phone: keep the cup; do not educate; offer reassurance; name a child who will benefit; do not say \u2018murder\u2019 on morning TV; say \u2018interruption\u2019; avoid calling anyone a consortium; if you must, say \u2018pool\u2019; do not invent a new anthem on live broadcast; if you must sing, hum. He had framed a tiny box of competence for me to carry into the field of cameras, and I took it because carrying something small convinces a lens you\u2019re not armed. Carlotta texted me a string of chalices and a snowman and a video where she had drawn a mouth on the mirror with lipstick and then erased it with her thumb; the mirror sighed; it was the opposite of cathartic; it was useful. Sparrow said she would not attend television because televisions and sparrows have an old argument about who invented flicker, and she preferred to spend the hour riding elevators to see which ones prayed when they were empty.\n\nWe went to the daytime show with our flag folded inside Luca\u2019s tote because flags in bags behave the way cats behave: insouciant and sure that a room will adjust to their existence. North wore a jacket that forgot to announce itself; he walked half a pace behind and half a breath to the left, and the producer re-labeled him as crew without knowing why. The host had the hair of a person who had learned to be lit from inside and the smile of a person accustomed to passing an open window at the moment the sunset remembers itself; she pressed my fingers like a vote and told me her mother made tea when the country broke and called it repair. I held the mug they gave me like a treaty freshly signed; the prop department preferred matte to gloss, but the steam still rose and threaded my face without disturbing itself on my skin. The camera tried very hard to blink and could not, so I did the kindness of blinking for both of us.\n\n\u201cYou raised a flag,\u201d the host said, voice wrapping itself around the word as if it were fragile and not a spear. \u201cCongratulations. What does the Interim govern.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreath,\u201d I said, and Dax\u2019s ghost ran his hands through his hair, but sometimes a cup makes you brave. \u201cThe space after decision and before action. The hallways we forget to sweep. The silence between a door\u2019s click and the footsteps turning away. We collect statements from anyone who has ever been told to wait in the lounge and be patient. We forgive taxes upon evidence of sincerity. We have an anthem that is a hush.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like poetry,\u201d she said, and the producer smiled with all his teeth because he likes poetry when it behaves like content.\n\n\u201cPoetry is what law calls itself when it eats its vegetables,\u201d I said, and her laugh was honest, which is a kind you don\u2019t waste. I said \u2018interruption\u2019 the way Dax had asked and did not say \u2018murder\u2019 because some nouns deserve rooms that can lock, and I kept my promise to avoid \u2018consortium\u2019 and instead said \u2018pool,\u2019 and every swimmer in the city looked up at the vent and thought of the sound chlorine makes in the nose. I said, \u201cIf you see our flag, you are under our protection for the length of a breath,\u201d and the sound engineer noted the way the room softened and turned his levels up a hair so the hush wouldn\u2019t eat the show.\n\nHowell tested us during the cooking segment, because men who build rooms enjoy doing it while butter melts; butter is persuasive, and he respects a rival. The studio lights cooled in a synchronized apology, and the induction burners blinked like owls, and the audience did that drawn-in inhale people do when they smell a storm through brick. The air pressed down like a hand that had forgotten to be gentle, and the teleprompter wrote the word wait twice as if to scold itself. North moved before I could move because his job is to get to the verb before the noun goes missing; he stepped forward into the space where sound was failing and put his palm on the cement floor as if it were a creature with a back that needed patting. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry,\u201d he said to the building, quiet enough the microphones didn\u2019t consent to carry it. \u201cWe brought weather without papers. We are here with permission. We will leave a copy on your loading dock.\u201d\n\nThe lights blinked like men told a joke in a dialect they nearly understood, and the burners exhaled, and the producer wrote down the phrase permission and apology on his hand because he is not a fool and knows when he is being handed copy that will taste good on late news. The audience applauded because applause is what humans do when they survive a draft they cannot name. The host said, \u201cWe all feel better,\u201d which is the kind of lie necessary to keep a country from dissolving on air, and later she whispered, \u201cI felt something stand down,\u201d and I awarded North in my head a stripe I had no authority to award. By the time we reached the sidewalk he had a text on the inside of his retinas that read: Adjunct advanced to Prime upon successful avoidance of a forced pause; please present for imprint. He held out his hand for Alma like a boy asking to cross the road, and Alma put the Choir\u2019s weight on his knuckles with a nod that was not sentimental and not indifferent but a record.\n\nWe held the Interim\u2019s first hearing between floors six and seven of the annex because six believes in the past and seven thinks it invented the future; it is useful to keep both wrong in the same room. Saffron brought cones because cones are the way cities say do not, but she arranged them like pews because she likes to see how people sit when they are asked to witness. The elevator doors agreed to stay open for the length of a song if we promised to hum, and we did, softly, a shade lower than comfortable so the cables could listen without having to translate. The call went out the old way and the new: paper on lampposts, posts on feeds, a woman with a bird voice telling her three most stubborn friends; the people who came were as reliable as plumbing: a union man who knew the price of bolts, a child with a cardboard crown, a woman who had lit candles in more churches than she believed in, Brazos with rope burns on his soul, Jonah wearing his posture like a confession, Kincaid in an outfit that would photograph well under fluorescents, Howell not invited and very much there at the edge because lines tempt him.\n\nLuca read the writ we had cooked the way poor people cook bones: long and patient until the noun gave itself up. We called it the Writ of Unclosure because sometimes you have to name the opposite of what the world keeps doing until it gets bored and stops. It said: No provisional diversion of heat, voice, or likeness shall be applied to a person within the Interim\u2019s jurisdiction without immediate public notice in a room with at least two doors and wind passing through. It said: All tags bearing the half-star must be background-sung and entered into Minutes audible to any person with a throat. It said: Apologies are keys; excuses are locks; choose accordingly. It said: Violators will be asked to carry a bowl until they drop it from fatigue and then be required to pick up what they spilled with their hands. The crowd hummed, not because they liked rules but because there is comfort in knowing where the stairs are when the building pretends to be a hill.\n\nWe took testimony because testimony is how you force a room to agree it has ears. Carlotta spoke first, saying the mirror had learned new handwriting and that she had a memory of my temperature like a dress you outgrow and refuse to give away. The teacher with the hands said, \u201cYou are not the first child to come back colder,\u201d and her voice put a shawl on every shoulder without permission and everyone let her because she had earned it by grading papers with kindness. Brazos told the story as if he were setting a rig, parts and timings and knots and everything, and when he got to the laminate he said the word laminate like a curse he was humbly borrowing for an occasion he hoped would not be repeated. Sparrow spoke so softly the elevator cables had to lean in; she said her stamp had been used as a splint, not as a knife, and that she was prepared to carry bowls for a year if that would keep another girl\u2019s heat from getting filed. Jonah talked about rooms that give you a line and take your name, and he kept not saying sorry because the thing he was sorry for was being asked to be useful in the worst way and he had done it.\n\nKincaid entered her minutes with the self-respect of a ledger that has learned to blush; she put Weather at the mercy of the Interim for cases bearing the circle, and she said publicly what men like her say privately when they fear they might be asked to defend a budget, which is: we need to be watched to deserve our windows. Howell offered commentary the way a museum offers placards beside stolen art; he said the Silent Studio was a misnomer and that silence is seldom silent when you press your ear to it; he called his collective a room that processes anxieties into policy, and the union man, who had been quiet until then, said, \u201cWe already have a word for that room. It\u2019s called a bar,\u201d and everyone laughed because the only way to keep a monster from learning your smell is to laugh at yourself loudly in a public place.\n\nThen Howell did what men who build rooms cannot help but do when challenged; he tried to close us. It was not dramatic; drama is for people who sell show. The air began to settle as if tired and the elevator\u2013which had agreed to be a chapel\u2013made a small mechanical decision that frightened me: it twitched toward shut. The cables tensed like tired muscle, and the doors inched as if drawn by a pen dragged by a hand that did not intend to write but did not want to drop the pen. People glanced sideways the way creatures do when they smell the ocean change its mind. North stood in the doorway with his palm up and did not push; he apologized, and he did it in a dialect doors understand.\n\n\u201cWe trespassed,\u201d he said, and in his voice lived a hundred hall monitors learned from a hundred buildings. \u201cWe assumed our hum was sufficient; we did not ask your bolts. If you let us finish our song we will wipe the fingerprints from your glass and oil the places people forget to oil because they are high and require a ladder. We brought wax. We brought a stamp. We will leave you a copy of our apology if you need to look at it later when your gears wake at three in the morning and ask if they were rude.\u201d\n\nThe elevator sighed with relief because it had been given an avenue of retreat that did not require a fight; the doors kissed the cones and then opened again, not in surrender but in amendment. Alma\u2019s mouth softened at the corners because she is not sentimental about men but she is sentimental about language, and that was language behaving. The crowd hummed without being told to, and I felt the little burr of Howell\u2019s gift for interruption slide off my skin the way a zipper unhooks when the dress finally agrees you have hips. North looked at me levelly and for the first time since the tin and the frost and the bathroom mirror we nodded at one another like equals in a storm.\n\nWe passed the Writ because we decided to pass it and because no one stopped us and because, in secret bureaucracies, that is often the only difference between law and hobby. The wax made a respectable puddle on the frame of the door, and the half-star printed clean on brushed steel as if steel had been hoping all day for something as stupid and earnest as a mark to wear. Saffron cried in that particular way security personnel cry, a quick wetness and an upright neck, and then pretended it was allergies and told us to keep moving because the building does not like to be crowded long. Jonah wiped his eyes with his sleeve and muttered something about dust, which was not untrue, and Brazos said, \u201cI\u2019ll carry bowls for a week if it means I never have to watch a room get smug again.\u201d\n\nAfter, we came down to the lobby where the receptionist had given herself a promotion to usher and liked it. The city had noticed in the way cities do: someone had put our seal on a T-shirt and the proceeds would go to the stunt coordinator fund Sparrow had imagined, someone had put the flag on a cake and the frosting line had wobbled precisely where the wind would; someone had drawn the word Interim on a wall and put a chair beneath it because words need places to sit. Dax texted me: you were good on air, you were righteous in the annex, remember to say yes to late-night because I have a mortgage, and also tell the boy with the not a phase sweatshirt he has better posture than Jonah. I texted back a photo of a spoon with wax on it and he answered with a stack of coins and a heart. It will never stop being strange to me that hearts make sense in line drawings when the actual muscle is a messy miracle.\n\nWe did not get the consolation of a culprit with a hat pulled low and a bad attitude. We got office furniture. The Silent Studio\u2019s room was summoned, as promised, by paperwork; it arranged itself in a sub-basement that had never been given a number because numbers make rooms think they can join committees, and this room liked being committee-proof. We entered not as a raid but as a delegation, which is to say we carried ourselves like people who have things to write down and do not mind waiting while the light finds a way to flatter us. The men at the table had faces built by human resources and hands that had gotten soft by holding long pens. A woman with a face like a pocketknife sat with them without being of them, and I wondered which of us had learned more about knives today and decided to file it under later.\n\n\u201cCustodian,\u201d said the chair who had elected himself. \u201cWe are concerned by your writ. It introduces wind into processes that benefit from sealed containers.\u201d He smiled at me the way men smile at babies offered good whiskey, and I smiled back the way women smile at men who think they invented grain. Howell sat at the far end, not absent and not present, the way a shadow sits in a tree and makes birds reconsider.\n\n\u201cYour sealed containers killed me,\u201d I said, and Luca made a soft sound because there is no way to say that sentence without scaring your sister. \u201cYou will ask me for proof and I will offer you the witness of my kitchen. You will tell me kitchens are unreliable. I will tell you we are not here to cave your logic in; we are here to introduce windows you do not get to frost. You called yourselves a studio and took no actors into your confidence. You will change your sign.\u201d\n\nThe pocketknife woman looked pleased because she likes a new sign the way other people like shoes. The chair man gestured at a whiteboard so clean it bragged. \u201cWe manage anxieties. We do not break bones. If a bone broke it was an accident of architecture, and we regret it while noting the efficiency of our regret. Who among you will confess to exemption from the market in feelings. We sell clarity. We do not sell death.\u201d\n\nKincaid made a noise like a ledger clearing its throat. She placed a stack of paper on the table and patted it the way you pat a child you have decided to let make a mistake. \u201cYou purchase minutes from Weather,\u201d she said. \u201cYou resell calm as if it were salt and not the air in a room with many doors. You cannot continue to run your margins through other people\u2019s heat without submitting your invoices to a jurisdiction.\u201d She looked at me and the look said, I am enjoying being righteous, let me be petty for three lines, and I nodded because sometimes petty is an antiseptic. \u201cWe recognize Interim. Do you.\u201d\n\nThey had a meeting in front of us while we watched because that is how men like to assert power: by performing a closed session open. They did not use a language I didn\u2019t understand; they used tone, which is older and worse. They said contingency and compliance and we are fiduciaries, and Jonah\u2019s face closed down because he has had enough of being narrated by men who are trying not to sweat. Sparrow stood behind me with one finger on the back of my elbow and traced circles like moth flights; she was drawing air through me to remind me I had it. Alma waited until the third time they said inevitable, then began to hum under her breath, and though the pitch was low I felt fillings consider moving, and the chair\u2019s pen began to leak a little because ink knows when the choir is bored.\n\n\u201cThis is what we will do,\u201d I said, not because I was finished being angry but because governance is what you do instead of combustion when you have a flag. \u201cYou will read the writ as if it had teeth because it does. You will send pre-notification to the Interim of any attempt to apply a tag bearing the half-star within a hallway, studio, road, hospital, courthouse, classroom, or kitchen in this city and any city that opens its windows to our flag. You will cease referring to yourselves as a studio in writing because that word belongs to people who sweat under lights. You will pick a name that suits you. You will accept this bowl.\u201d I put the wax bowl on the table and saw how three men flinched because they understood the spell of bowls if not the language, and I pushed it toward the chair. \u201cYou will carry it everywhere for a week. When you put it down, you will remember it. That remembering is the point.\u201d\n\nThe pocketknife woman smiled because she likes homework. The chair wrinkled his nose because bowls are below him and that is his tragedy. Howell, who had not spoken, lifted one hand from his knee as if weighing wind and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a fair price for being permitted to keep a job that should never have existed,\u201d and the room heard him because he had finally chosen to be interesting. The chair drafted a memo in his head and sent it to everyone who could approve his salary; he said, \u201cWe have notes,\u201d and I said, \u201cWe have ink,\u201d and Sparrow\u2019s finger moved from circles to a straight line up my arm because we were done here.\n\nOutside, the air didn\u2019t forgive us because air doesn\u2019t; it accepts you if you don\u2019t lie. We stood under a sky that could have passed for honest and a drone tilted its face toward our seal and then away because we had become background, which is the goal of every government that wants to last long enough to create a museum about itself. North bent without ceremony and drew a small chalk line across the threshold to the sub-basement because some rooms require leashing, and then he breathed out and the chalk flared cold for a second that tasted like a lake in early spring. He was pale in the way good work makes a person pale, and I made him eat the last of the sandwich we had saved not because he needed food but because rituals should be protected from hunger.\n\nAt home the Directory had grown another page like a careful fungus. It recorded our hearing not with adjectives but with lines that remembered feet: Attending; Speaking; Resolutions; Objections; The Comedic Interventions of the Union; The Elevation of Adjunct to Prime: North, attested; The First Application of the Writ of Unclosure: successful. It had left a margin for dissent and someone had already written in tiny letters: stairs are not always better than ramps, which was the kind of dissent I like because it assumes we both want to get to the same place with grace. The flag in the window had learned the day\u2019s wind and rested like a creature that has run and been loved.\n\nLuca went to the sink and washed the wax bowl with a gentleness that would have forgiven a spoon if it had been cruel earlier. Sparrow sat on the floor because chairs make her nervous and put her cardigan on the back of a chair anyway because symbols are for everyone. Alma answered three messages from women whose names are never in the paper and then leaned against the counter with her head tilted back and closed her eyes without sleeping; she doesn\u2019t need to sleep to restore, she needs to be held up by walls that know her weight. North sat at the table and examined his card, which had changed while we were in the elevator; the letters had thickened, and the word Adjunct had learned its own past and settled into Prime with the relief of a shoe that fits.\n\nI stood at the window and watched our flag breathe, and for a moment the air inside my chest matched it. The city was busy not saying our name because saying a new government\u2019s name too often is a way of trying to own it. That was fine. We had been made to be background, and background is what you hold so the picture can be looked at without falling apart. My phone buzzed. It was a message from an unknown number with no signature, only a picture of a door with a small circle drawn on it so carefully the ink had not bled, and underneath the circle, a note: I did not sign. I watched. I will speak. The photo had been taken in a stairwell and the hand that had taken it had not trembled.\n\nWe were not done. Thursday had not been invented yet for this week. Howell would build rooms with the kind of persistence that made men in the old stories kings until a horse broke a leg, and Kincaid would send us minutes like a plea for a life she didn\u2019t exactly want to renounce but wanted to see in better light. Sparrow would find an elevator that got religious at noon and coax it into being a courthouse. Alma would go find the corner of the city where Anahi had disappeared herself and speak to its plumbing until the pipes answered. Dax would book me on late-night and ask me to perform warmth, and I would, because warmth is a skill and not a temperature. Luca would paint a small flag in the bottom corner of our kitchen window and forget about it until spring, when the sun found it and made it look like an invitation.\n\nThat night I dreamed no car and no flip and no fire. I dreamed a hallway that refused to pick a floor and a woman with a yellow cardigan who sorted paper into three piles labeled soon, later, never, and then fed the never to a bird who went out the window and came back with a string in its beak. In the dream, I took the string and tied it to my wrist and to North\u2019s and to Luca\u2019s and to Alma\u2019s, and when the building tilted we tilted together and did not fall. I woke to a city that had not been improved by our writ and had not been harmed by it either, which is also victory if you\u2019ve ever sat on a curb and watched people learn to take turns. On the kitchen counter the wax tin had caved a little at one edge like a smile that got away from itself, and the seal sat where I had left it, heavy and honest and ready to be used again. The air in the apartment had chosen to be friendly. It is a choice. We make it every time.",

It sat on the windowsill and looked at the flag until the fabric agreed to lift with a little ceremony, as if stretching could be a national act. Coffee did the same thing it always does, which is to say it remembered to be bitter and then forgave itself. The Directory had grown not by page but by weight; I could feel it in the way the table learned a new note. On the open leaf, no longer pretending it had opened itself by chance, a line waited with the calm of a summons: Aegis Pairing: imprint pending; venue assigned, 10:30; bring your seal and your breath. Alma had texted me the location before I could tell the paper I was coming; she always plays the conductor, even when the train insists it is self-driving. North knocked once and then didn\u2019t knock again, which is how you treat a house you intend to protect. When I opened the door he was where knocks go to rest, hands empty in a way that made the hallway remember its job. \u201cIt will smell like lightning,\u201d he said, and when I laughed, the laugh landed properly on the floor instead of turning into a draft.\n\nThe imprint happened in the place where the city keeps its humming. Substation P-9 had a fence that apologized for being necessary and a gate that had learned to swing without squealing because maintenance men unlearned superstition slower than other men and oiled kindness into hinges. Inside, a woman in a jacket that might once have been a uniform but had since become a skin stood with a clipboard and a scar that believed in the usefulness of straight lines. She introduced herself as Marshal Corbyn and she shook my hand with a friendliness that did not require warmth. The platform they had set up was not a dais and not an altar; it was the kind of table engineers trust, thick wood gone smooth from hands and math. There were tools you could name and tools you couldn\u2019t, and in the middle a plate of tempered glass laid over a disc of hammered copper like a compromise that had learned to last. Corbyn tapped the copper with a fingernail and the sound it made was older than bureaucracy. \u201cWe don\u2019t do blood,\u201d she said, as if someone had asked and been rebuked by the weather. \u201cWe do promises, and we trap a breath when it still thinks it is free, and we put a little salt on it because the body likes to be reminded it is not theory.\u201d\n\nWe went through the sentences as if we had rehearsed, which we had not, except in the way good sentences rehearse themselves in a human being who has been taught to be careful. North said, \u201cI will stand where she refuses to step without permission,\u201d and the plate we were touching registered his voice as a temperature change, a quick exhale of heat that left a ring no eye would see and every meter would. I said, \u201cI will ask before I enter rooms that behave like animals,\u201d and I watched the frost gather under my palm in handwriting that had begun to look like mine instead of like whoever had been practicing in my bathroom mirror. Corbyn laid a square of gauze over our hands with her mouth soft on the word gauze, because some officers love fabric like surgeons do. She sprinkled salt that tasted of the sea you get in storms and rocks, and she set the seal in the center with the good weight of someone who enjoys heavy things because they refuse to pretend. \u201cYou are not each other\u2019s weapons,\u201d she said, and the power lines above us hummed their assent. \u201cYou are not each other\u2019s excuses. You are each other\u2019s proof.\u201d\n\nThe glass caught our breath and made a sound like a hard candy cracking, and the copper received it as if it had been waiting at this table since the city first decided to put wires on its shoulders. The seal pressed half-star into the gauze with a dignity the wax at home could only dream of, and when Corbyn lifted it, the fabric kept a shimmer that was not quite light. North\u2019s card changed itself in his pocket because authority likes to be dramatic when no one is watching; when he brought it out, the letters had acquired a refraction, a humility that pretends to be vanity, and the word Adjunct had squared its shoulders into Prime as if it had done push-ups. They gave me nothing physical because everything they intended to give was already in the air, but the Directory added a paragraph by the time we drove back, lines about jurisdiction adjacency and two sigils that had not been on my eyes before and now would be forever: a little ladder and a small bowl. \u201cLadder means escalation that is allowed,\u201d Corbyn said, a smile in her voice that made the hum of the substation flirt with being a song. \u201cBowl means apology you carry on purpose. You\u2019ll need both. People without ladders throw stones. People without bowls break their teeth on wind.\u201d\n\nWe celebrated by not telling anyone, which is a way of keeping precious things from burning off in the sun. On the way out, a man in a hard hat with his name stitched on in gray thread lifted two fingers to North in the old salute men used when they had to make respect travel across a noisy room. He gave me a nod he would have given a weather vane that had done its work in an honest storm. In the car, Alma called to say she had already got the minutes of our imprint from a clerk who claimed to have dreamed them, which is how information travels between rooms when everyone pretends their fences are decorative. She added, lightly, that my inbox contained six invitations to governance group chats in which people with opinions about the constitution of tiny places shared photos of their flags in flattering light; the Perpetual Lunch had gone lowercase and was calling itself per-lunch; the Duchy of Bridges sent a biceps emoji; the President of Grafton-on-Courts sent a recipe for stew with a footnote about how to keep small nations from sticking to the bottom of the pot. \u201cDon\u2019t reply until you\u2019ve eaten something that grew in dirt,\u201d Alma said. \u201cIt will help.\u201d\n\nSparrow had spent the morning riding elevators as if they were horses that occasionally had theology. She met us at the municipal annex with her cardigan tied around her waist and a notebook full of small circles that had not bled. \u201cThe one between eight and nine says Hail Mary when the cable touches,\u201d she said, without irony and without religion, as if the elevator were allowed to make friends. \u201cThe one by the loading bay likes to hold breath for the length of a commercial. The service car in the west wing stops to pray on twelve because twelve isn\u2019t there on the buttons and no one likes to be left off a list.\u201d She took us to a door that didn\u2019t know it was a door because for decades it had been telling itself it was a wall, and she knocked with two knuckles the way clerks knock when they are introducing a letter to a desk. The space beyond smelled like lemon and paper and an old pencil eaten down past the dignity of its eraser.\n\nAnahi was present and absent in a tidy way that left dignity in the room. There was a packet of papers bound with twine and a sovereign stapler that stapled nothing to air and two paper clips bent into swans. There was a map taped inside the cabinet that listed Nothing To See Here where anyone else would have listed the plan for Tuesday. Someone had written, in a hand that made beauty look inevitable, Do not confuse urgency with importance; bend minutes toward the stairs if the hallway lies. Sparrow wanted to touch the note and didn\u2019t. She folded her hands instead and whispered without whispering, \u201cShe isn\u2019t gone so much as parallel.\u201d Her voice made parallel sound like a country a person goes to for treatment when cancer decides to be feral. Alma stood in the doorway like a hinge and said nothing, which is how grief behaves when it is working.\n\nDax got me booked on a late-night that had grown tender in its old age. The set was a living room pretending to be a stage and the host had the eyes of a dog who had learned to accept applause as a kind of petting. He shook my hand and stole a joke about bowls and then gave it back to me to deliver because he is a gentleman thief when his wife watches. North did what North does and became part of the furniture that knows how to brace a room. I said the things you say when a nation is not yet a costume and cannot be tried on by people who prefer clothing to commitment. I said we had written a writ that made wind audible and that we had placed a stamp on an elevator door because buildings get lonely. The host laughed in the place where people laugh when you let them relax, and then he looked up at an imaginary balcony and spoke to his mother, as he always does, because she died when the show was new and he kept her in the rafters. \u201cShe likes you,\u201d he said to me, gently, and the camera leaned in to see my eyes, which is rude, and I let it because it pays the crew.\n\nWednesday pretended to be Tuesday until Howell proved he had a watch. He sent the message on cheap paper that had been expensive when he was young, and he wrote with a pen that liked to behave like a fountain when given a napkin. The note had been left on my mat under the door like a present from a neighbor who leaves zucchini in summer, and my stomach recognized the handwriting before my eyes did. DUSK, he wrote, as if dusk were punctual. 101, under the new bridge where the old one looks up at it. Bring the bowl. Bring the man who apologizes to doors. If you want hands, I will give you the ones that did it. If you want a room, I will give you an audience. If you want a version, I will make one.\n\nWe didn\u2019t take all of us because drama doesn\u2019t like a crowd unless it has bought extra chairs. Brazos came because his rope-work had snagged on that place and would not come free. Saffron came because she had decided protection was her vocation and not her wage, and because the city had given her a key in the shape of authority and she liked to try locks. Alma came because she would and because you don\u2019t send your girls to a bridge with a man who renames himself and not stand at the edge of the light. Sparrow stayed with Luca and the box of papers because the world needs two kinds of fighters and kitchens are as violent as highways when you put truth on plates. The flag came as a pin on my lapel and as a shadow on my breath, and it was enough.\n\nThe 101 had been repaired in a way that pretended to be seamless. The new bridge had a smooth young spine and the old one lay below it like an ancestor. Every city in this country has a place where the new sits on the old and the wind sits on both and tells them to get along. Howell stood where sound goes to collect itself and he looked like a clerk again because clerks are what evil uses when it wants to keep its fingerprints clean. He had three people with him and all of them wore a color that refuses to photograph properly, the gray that only a certain grade of suit can manage, and even then only if the wearer likes the smell of copy machines. He introduced them with the economy of a man who has learned that names are ways in. \u201cGrey,\u201d he said for one, and that one inclined his head because anonymity had been his job and his talent. \u201cGlass,\u201d he said for another, and this one\u2019s hands had scars like punctuation from someone else\u2019s knife. \u201cLedger,\u201d he said for the third, and she wore her hair in a tight coil like a woman who expects to be called a name and would prefer it to be correct.\n\n\u201cYou promised hands,\u201d I said, and I saw how Howell relished consistency. He set a table with it and invited himself to dinner.\n\nGrey stepped forward and took off his glove and then put it back on, which is the motion men make when they want you to notice that they own their hands twice. \u201cI carried the powder,\u201d he said, flat, the way men speak when they expect forgiveness to be a chop they can buy on the cheap cut of the cow. \u201cI sealed the rig. I brought a note the crew would swallow without chewing because the font looked familiar. I took a call and then pretended my ear had lost the number. I was paid to reduce heat. I did that. Your person stopped being heat and started being a record. It is not my fault the record cut itself loose and walked.\u201d\n\nGlass moved his wrists in the air with the memory of heat on them and shook off something that would bother him for the rest of his life. \u201cI polished the chamber,\u201d he said, and the words made Brazos\u2019s hands ball because the idea of a chamber polished makes men who love engines think of slaughterhouses. \u201cI like clean rooms. I like to make sure cracks don\u2019t get away from me. They told me this would make the room quiet during the dangerous part. They said the quiet would keep the blood in one place. I believed them because I prefer to see what I am supposed to be looking at. If you want a confession, I have the receipts for the gloves.\u201d\n\nLedger met my eyes and did me the respect of not flinching. \u201cI ran the numbers,\u201d she said, and the wind liked her for her honesty because it is a ledger too in its way. \u201cI saw that purchasing minutes from Weather would lower legal exposure to three suits and two funerals instead of nine and a class action. I saw the bowl of money and I saw the staircase of precedent and I signed the form to put the bowl at the top instead of at the bottom. The math was elegant. The math killed you. I am prepared to carry bowls until I hate soup.\u201d\n\nIf I had been someone else, I might have thought I had my murderer. If I had been someone the city had not made into a place between, I might have accepted the relief of names like Grey and Glass and Ledger and stored them where forgiveness or fury can go when they need a bed. But Howell had promised hands and had offered me a room, and when men like him are generous it is because the generous thing distracts from the place generosity has learned to keep its knives. \u201cWho told you to be elegant,\u201d I said, and I did not mean whose voice and I did not mean whose check. I meant the grammar. I meant the habit. I meant the way a culture can talk a person into believing that killing is a type of tidying.\n\nHowell showed me his teeth without malice. \u201cLanguage did,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are a woman famously good at saying things other people wrote until they sound like your own apologies. You know what language can make a hand do. If you want the man who delivered the order, I can call him and he will arrive in a car that is too clean, and he will be made of lacquer and fear and gentlemen\u2019s clubs, and when he says sorry you will smell his father. It will not satisfy you. If you want the board member who authorized the contingency fund, I will give you a list of surnames whose first letters can be rearranged into the word harbor, and you will pick one, and he will call his lawyer, and the lawyer will say my client did not intend, and the judge will say intent is slippery, and you will go home with the kind of justice that ruins lunch. If you want a rule, you have made one. If you want a sentence, you will write it.\u201d\n\nWe had brought the bowl because men like Howell inherit an allergy to bowls and I wanted to watch him itch. Saffron held it like an emblem and not like a weapon because she is not confused about what carries what. North set it on the asphalt and the bowl recognized ground and became heavy the way obligations do when you place them where they belong. Brazos, to his credit, did not throw it at anyone, which is how I know he is the man I thought he was. I picked it up and pressed the wax with the seal until the impression learned the lines in this place, and then I handed the bowl to Grey. He took it because the choreography of such moments has trained even men who deface the stage to accept props. \u201cCarry it for a week,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen you think you\u2019ve earned the right to set it down, count one hundred breaths and then ask the nearest child if you\u2019re done. If you drop it, don\u2019t buy another. Fix it with your hands. If someone asks you what it is, tell them it is the temperature you owe.\u201d\n\nGrey accepted like a person accepts medicine in a clinic with a plastic fern: polite, suspicious, already composing a story where the dose is half. Glass took a smaller bowl because even sin has proportions, and Ledger took no bowl because numbers have always preferred to write punishments for themselves; she wrote on her palm instead, a column of tally marks she would regret and add to and then laugh at when she was alone. Howell watched and did an old-fashioned thing I hadn\u2019t seen in a while: he inclined his head to a decision as if bowing could keep him from being caught by it. He tried to close us, because it is his trick and because you can\u2019t ask a scorpion not to know its tail. The air thickened like soup left too long on the stove and every sound tried to put on socks and go to bed. It would have worked on the person I was before a glass plate trapped my breath under my own hand and asked it to learn to sing.\n\nNorth said sorry to the bridge and to the old bridge under it and to the patch of asphalt that thinks it is tired. I spoke to Howell with the grammar of ladders because it was the one the day had given me. \u201cWe are in a place with more than one exit,\u201d I said, and that fact made the thickening thin, because exits like to be acknowledged. \u201cPermission,\u201d I said, and the chalk line that North had drawn under our feet on the way in flared briefly like a smirk. \u201cApology,\u201d I said, and the bowl in Grey\u2019s hands went heavier and turned being carried into a thing like prayer. The closure slid away from us without having the dignity to admit it had been tried, and Howell\u2019s cheek twitched with the annoyance of a man whose favorite trick has been named aloud on television and therefore lost.\n\n\u201cWe could arrest them,\u201d Saffron said, and for a second I loved her with a patriotic fervor reserved for people who look at a wrench and see a lever. \u201cNot because it sticks in court, but because it sticks in feeds. We need to show people that bowls aren\u2019t our only ceremony.\u201d Alma made a small sound, which is how she swears when the room has children in it. The idea of taking Grey by the wrist and leading him into a building with fluorescent lights and gum under the benches had a human thrill, like eating bad candy and not paying for it. The thrill would evaporate the second a man in a suit wrote a sentence about intent on paper that smells like eucalyptus, and then all we\u2019d have is a headline and a smarting wrist.\n\n\u201cTake their room,\u201d I said to Howell, because governance is theft when you do it well and politely. \u201cIt can\u2019t call itself a studio. It can call itself a lounge if it likes the sound of furniture. It cannot buy minutes without a throat in the room. It cannot pour heat into a ledger without the ledger blushing, and if your sign ever shows the half-star, the circle must go through our desk. When it doesn\u2019t, we will hum at your windows until your interns confess their mothers\u2019 names.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the space between my shoulder and my ear like a man deciding if he could fit a mark there and had to admit he could not. He nodded again because the nod cost him less than pretending to be stubborn. \u201cThursday,\u201d he said, and the word had stopped being a promise and become an appointment with the weather. \u201cYour murderer is a habit. Your habit is to agree to speed when you are already falling. You will find a single throat to put it in because courts love throats. It will be a clever throat. It will not feel like a victory. If you want one of those, you will have to invent it.\u201d\n\nWe left the bridge with no sirens because drama had already been paid for elsewhere. Brazos, who has trained men to fall and survive without any of us calling it salvation, walked beside Grey and taught him how to carry a bowl in a crosswind. Saffron texted a cousin who worked in a building where signatures like to learn flamenco and told her to watch for bowl-bearing men walking like they had ulcers. Alma stood by the edge of sun and shade and checked the names in her pocket and revised which pockets were now allowed to hold which names. North and I walked the chalk line back to the car and treated it like a parade, because you have to model what you want the world to do with your simple lines. The flag on my lapel waited until the door closed and then fluttered once in relief.\n\nBack at the apartment, the Directory had added a function I didn\u2019t know it had. The margins had become a ribbon of indexes, and under W it listed Weather, Witnesses, and Writ of Unclosure, and under S it listed Sparrow, Stills, and Silent Studio, and the last had a line: formerly a room; renamed: Lounge of Contingencies; current status: watched. Sparrow had found her way to my kitchen without asking the house first because the house liked her and because she had, at some point, fed its elevator a pep talk. She placed on the table a small object that looked like a doorbell poetically remade; it had no wires and a button the color of things that mean go. \u201cAnahi builds these for rooms that forget to talk,\u201d she said, touching the button with the care people reserve for the first freckle on a baby. \u201cIf a door is determined to be a mouth, you give it something to bite that won\u2019t scream. Press this when the closure tries to pretend it doesn\u2019t understand you. It will remind the threshold that it\u2019s not a lid.\u201d\n\nLuca, who had been painting at the window because she refuses to let governance steal all her verbs, turned with a brush in her hand and asked, with the directness she keeps chained and lets loose at the right times, whether we were done looking for the balloon labeled murderer and had remembered to look under our own skirts for the string. We stared at her like well-meaning idiots and she grinned with the fond malice siblings learn when they know you won\u2019t leave just because they were right. \u201cSpeed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all sold speed. You sold it. Dax sold it. The network sold it. Brazos sold it with math and then took the money back and sold safety with thicker math. Howell sells pauses as a luxury. Ledger sold the price of slow as an expense. The murder is a market. If you want to fry a person instead of a habit, call Studio Counsel by his first name and tell him you\u2019re sorry you made him lie in emails. He\u2019ll confess in a paragraph. If you want to do your job, write a law about speed.\u201d\n\nWriting laws in kitchens is the oldest trick in the book and I recommend it if you are ever given a country by surprise. We wrote a draft of a law and called it the Speed Limit because euphemism is another kind of bowl and we wanted people to be able to lift it. It said: No escalation shall be signed without the signature of the person whose heat will be contained. It said: Hours will be paid in full even if minutes are borrowed; you cannot dock a worker for weather. It said: All footage taken in the hour around a person\u2019s death shall be treated as a body and not as a product; it will be named and stored and not edited until breath has had time to lint the corners of the room with patience. It said: Networks that weaponize urgency will be taxed in air; we will put flags in their lobbies that hum certain keys until their editors suggest better verbs. Sparrow looked at our drafts and added a note in the margin in a handwriting that would make a judge check her glasses: If this law passes, it must pass by humming and not by vote, which is to say the halls must learn it; committees that own the elevators must agree to carry it. Alma smiled and did not hide it because this was her heaven: the afterlife of a rule where it stays busy.\n\nWe went to bed thinking legislation might be the kiss that wakes our city, which is a thing people think when they have not yet read the comments. By morning, Howell proved he reads faster than my fans and changed the terrain in the most obvious way: a man who had never been photographed unposed delivered to us in a cardboard envelope a document with a signature at the bottom and a date that made the paper smell of hot machines. Studio Counsel had signed his name to an escalation notice drafted on a day the network had been closed for a holiday. The name was long and grim and the handwriting legible. The post-it attached to the top belonged to Kincaid because the ink had a hurry to it. It read: He got in front of the story and then threw himself into it. He will resign before anyone can obscure anything. He is tired. Bring a bowl.\n\nWe took a bowl because that is how the Interim tells a person they have to carry their answer around until the weight educates their posture. We met Counsel in a room the building had set aside as a lounge for men whose rings had begun to account for their lives, and he looked like a man who had lost the ability to pretend he enjoys peanuts put in bowls by strangers. He didn\u2019t wait for us to accuse him and he didn\u2019t wait for a camera because his relationship with cameras was lust and shame and he had decided to be a monk. He said, very clearly, that he had written the escalation note because he believed in the beauty of clean paperwork, and that he believed if lawyers managed the mess then no flesh would have to, and that he liked the feeling of being the man who could stop a river by writing river twice. He said, just as clearly, that he did not read the hazard notes because he trusted Brazos to fight gravity and he trusted the math because math had never broken his heart. He said he was wrong. He said he had facilities in his house for grief but none good enough. He took the bowl and started to carry it and did not look back.\n\nBy Thursday, as promised, we had a murderer who was not a murderer and a murder which was a culture and a city that had agreed to try to learn a new song. It did not feel like victory. It felt like a day in which the lights worked and the mail arrived on time, which is what victory feels like when you govern without trumpets. We filed the Speed Limit into the Directory because Alma said the Directory likes its teeth brushed, and we told Weather to put notices on all their doors that said We Are Not A Studio so even the janitors would be forced to pronounce the difference as they passed. Howell sent me a postcard from somewhere with a dune on it and a lighthouse, and on the back of it he had written a sentence in pencil like a man trying out letters for the first time: You will want to save someone personally now; you will be tempted to make a room for them and call it a law; resist. I put the postcard under the refrigerator magnet shaped like a pear because pears are honest about ripening and because I wanted to insult Howell with fruit.\n\nSparrow found an elevator that cried at noon and made it take a breath and calm down, and in return it offered a small offering from a ledge only elevators know how to find: a paperclip bent into an arrow and a receipt for pastries from a bakery Anahi had favored. On the back of the receipt, someone had written in tight script: The stairs think they are superior. Teach them humility by resting on them. It wasn\u2019t a lead, not exactly; it was a way to keep from becoming the kind of government that forgets to sit. We took it, gratefully, and went to the bakery and purchased too many good things and paid cash so no one could make a graph of our appetites. The woman behind the counter knew Sparrow and put an extra bun into our bag, saying, \u201cFor the rooms,\u201d and Sparrow laughed in a way that made the air heavier with kindness. Sometimes the city meets you halfway because you remembered to hum on an elevator and sometimes it meets you because buns are good and cost what we can afford.\n\nThere were still places we had not put our mark and still corners that preferred rooms without windows. We had not found Anahi in any shape a person could hug, and I had not watched the car flip again because I was not a ghoul and because there are truths you hold in reserve like a last coin. We had written a writ and a law and taught a bridge to be polite. We had been on television and put a flag in a window and convinced a bowl to become ceremony. North had learned the names that doors like to be called and I had learned to ask the air to let children pass in front of me when the hallway got narrow. We were not done, but we were not trapped. In this work, both are miracles, and you cannot teach miracles so much as you can feed them when they show up hungry.",
