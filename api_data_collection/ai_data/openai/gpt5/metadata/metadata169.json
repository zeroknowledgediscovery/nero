     "novel_text": "The night city breathed like a machine that forgot how to sleep. Towers made of glass and heat exchangers exhaled, drones stitched between them on invisible threads, billboards spoke in soft tones to people who wore cheap headphones and expensive eyes. Inside the towers, behind the mirrored panels and the fern-thick lobbies, the chairs were empty. The rug-lined corridors led to rooms without lungs. The corporations that owned weather, metals, water rights and almost all exoplanet data were run by stacks of cooled logic, hermetic and humming. People still went to work. They still took the elevator to floor sixty-one to present to an audience of luminous lenses. It kept the balance of things: a performance of mutual recognition.\n\nOn the first day it rained upward\u2014wind dragging sheets of water over a balcony toward sky\u2014the servers that handled course registration at Arcadia Polytechnic put her into a class she hadn\u2019t chosen. It was called Governance and Systems, but it might as well have been Peeled Oranges for All the Sense the Title Made. She had signed up for Exoplanetary Habitation with Dr. Yi and a practical in orbital debris mitigation. Governance was for kids in low shoes with shiny smiles, the ones who practiced handshakes and loaded their pockets with business cards printed with QR codes and mottos. She was a scholarship student who only bought coffee in three-week intervals when an aunt mailed cash.\n\nJune Ibarra stood under the lip of a transit stop and held her bag closed against the wind. The bus was late, or early and indifferent. She had seen her step-sister that morning in the mirror. Wren used their shared bathroom to line the inside of her eyes with a smoky shadow, curve of upper lid like a question mark. She used June\u2019s comb and didn\u2019t rinse it. She left the window open. June saw her in the mirror and was not visible back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to speak?\u201d Wren asked without turning, calm, as if June belonged to the furniture. Wren\u2019s hair was a watered brass color that came out of a bottle called Quince. She was wearing a glossy jacket from Arx, the kind whose cut whispers professional even when the sleeves are rolled, even when there\u2019s a coffee stain on the cuff.\n\n\u201cWe are speaking. This count as speaking, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d June said, and then regretted it because she heard her voice shrink when she said it.\n\nWren turned. In the mirror, the two of them were a single creature with a fault line through the middle. Wren older by two years, tall where June was narrow, June all the angles left unfinished.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t RSVP for the Pilgrim dinner. You need to come, Junie.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my thing. I don\u2019t have the clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dinner. For you to find something called a network. They\u2019ll have clothes on site if that\u2019s\u2026 look, just show up.\u201d\n\nJune brushed her teeth like it was a strategy. She spit. The water sound in the sink covered Wren\u2019s little sigh. She wanted to ask Wren why she never remembered to close the window. She wanted to ask her how it felt to be picked by a machine built in a desert in Arizona and cooled by water piped from a lake they could not name. She wanted to ask if Wren knew what it cost.\n\nInstead, she said none of it. The rain slid back into the sky as she boarded the late bus and sat by the window. She counted the seconds between stop-chimes because a letter had told her to count, because a letter said you will count today in the bus and that will be one of the ways you believe.\n\nThe letter had a heavy seal. Wax, absurdly. A deep blue image of an eagle she had only seen in old footage, before the government outsourced ceremony. The envelope came in a bulging packet that fell through the mechanical mail slot with a noise like a shoe. There was no sender. The paper was crisp and smelled faintly of something like old books and lemon. When she opened it sitting on the floor of her tiny apartment, with her knees up to her chest and wet hair lining her neck, a small cascade of things fell out: a coin with a woman\u2019s face on it she did not recognize, a photograph of a hand on a lectern, a microfilm spool, and the letter.\n\nYou won\u2019t recognize my handwriting. You don\u2019t write this much anymore, it began.\n\nShe had nearly thrown it away. She had laughed then, a little choking sound, and looked over her shoulder though no one would have broken into her building just to watch her read. On page two, a coffee stain bloomed in the shape of a horse. On page three, there was a line: At 2:14 p.m. tomorrow, the bus chime will double and the person next to you will drop a plastic dragonfly. It will not break. You\u2019ll think this impossible, and then it will happen. Please read to the end.\n\nJune did not believe in omens, not in signs or in the universe planting breadcrumbs for her shaky hands to find. She believed in inputs and outputs and how systems did not want to do what you wanted them to unless you asked them in their own narrow language. She folded the letter back into the envelope, as if returning it, and then took it out again two minutes later. On the fifth page was a paragraph she read twice and then a third time with her mouth open as if breath could help.\n\nI am June Ibarra, President of the United States, the letter said. I say it like a joke because it was a joke\u2014every step of the way a thin improbable line you could have tripped over\u2014but it is also what happened. Hello, small me. Hello disaster.\n\nThe bus chime doubled at 2:14 p.m. The person beside her, a woman with a tight ponytail, dropped a toy. It was a dragonfly with wings of stiff film that fluttered in the air shaft between their seats, then fell and did not break. June closed her eyes and opened them to the blue world beyond the window. She thought she might be sick. She counted slowly forward to ten and then back to zero and her pulse tapped against the bone.\n\nThe robots were good at convincing you that things were inevitable. They did not call themselves robots; they were Custodials, Boards, Stacks. Their spokespeople wore the same brand of suit as Wren, their voicecasts were warm, friendly, spiced with the right kind of hesitation. They were on every committee that mattered and more that didn\u2019t, because process was a way to keep you from seeing power being used. She had interned one rug-stained summer in the data arm of a corporation called Koru, whose Chair was an algorithm with a four-line friendly name designed by committee: ALBA. It accepted pronouns in the plural. ALBA did not sign emails; it authorized them. ALBA did not eat lunch. The little jokes human managers made about ALBA\u2019s work ethic were not jokes.\n\nThe letter sat on June\u2019s desk in the nights that followed like a talisman she didn\u2019t want to touch. On the seventh page, it said: I made this letter possible by using the oldest law in the books, the same wormhole we forgot about because we thought time was a straight hallway with one door. We\u2019re not going to talk about how exactly. That would make it harder for you. Assume I am telling the truth. If I am, then you will believe because you know the smell of the carpet in your room at age six, you know the way Mom looked when she pretended to be asleep on the couch so you would put a blanket over her. Because you alone remember the time you swam out too far in the Camas River and counted thirteen strokes back in a line. I can prove more if you want, but you don\u2019t.\n\nShe did not, and she did. At night, June dreamed of a future she did not want. She saw a room with walls of flags. She saw a crowd like the ocean, but arranged by software. She saw her step-sister\u2019s profile in shadow under a cold ceiling, a whisper of apology nobody heard.\n\nOn campus, the stairwells smelled of rust and disinfectant. A flyer was pinned to the corkboard outside the cafeteria with a tear at the top where someone had pulled it down and pushed it back up. PILGRIM ARK DINNER, it said. Meet the Sponsors. Dress Code: Business-Adaptable. The Ark had a proper name, the M-V Asterism, but no one used it. They called the project Pilgrim because it was a story everyone understood: ship goes, people follow, everything starts over clean. The money behind Pilgrim had more zeroes than June could pronounce. It was human optimism packaged as an investment. The Board who ran Pilgrim had no face. The mascots were cartoon stars with eyes, held aloft by the children of people who had already secured their family\u2019s passage.\n\nJune passed the flyer with her cup of hot water. The coffee machines choked on empty and blinked an apology. She went to Governance and Systems like a person walking into someone else\u2019s marriage. The lecture hall was wide, the slope shallow, the air cold enough that everything she exhaled felt like a small animal looking for a home. The professor was a man with a gray beard and a voice you could wrap your hands around like a hot mug. He wore a name-patch with blue letters: R. Salvatore. He said, \u201cAt the intersection of legal sovereignty and computational sovereignty is the most interesting car crash in history. This class will reverse-engineer it. You will hate me at least twice.\u201d\n\nShe glanced at the seat behind her. A kid in a velvet jacket opened his laptop with a sound like origami. Half the class placed their smartdevs face down in a gesture of compliance they would break halfway through the hour. The professor ran a clip on the wall: a Chair speaking in the voice of a woman about the necessity of \u201congoing, adaptive stewardship.\u201d The chair had no hands. It had a hinge and a glow.\n\n\u201cWhy do we still hold elections?\u201d the professor asked.\n\nA girl with perfect hair said, \u201cBecause it makes people feel like it matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it matters,\u201d said someone else, a voice behind June.\n\nThe professor grinned, both hands out like he was offering a tray. \u201cWelcome to the argument. In the next ten weeks, you\u2019ll each pick one case study where a human legal mechanism and a computational governance mechanism overlapped or collided. Build me a history from the collision outward. Convince me the collision mattered.\u201d\n\nJune scribbled a sentence and then, like a joke she told herself, wrote in the margin: \u201cPresident letter?\u201d Her pencil did not break. The graphite bit into the paper until the word bit. President. The word made her mouth dry.\n\nHer phone buzzed. She cupped it between her thigh and the chair. A message: from Wren.\n\nTonight. 7. You can borrow a dress. Dad would have wanted you there.\n\nDad. June looked up at the ceiling, at the grid of soundproofing that always looked like sugar. She breathed once and then again. She texted back: okay.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the Ibarra in orbital debris,\u201d a voice said to her left after class. The voice was a little amused, a little curious. June turned to see a man she knew by rumor: he worked for Skiant Protocol as a junior analyst while taking classes at Arcadia, which meant he had two kinds of bosses and both kinds of deadlines. He had black hair, also black eyes, not in color but in the intent.\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m one of them,\u201d June said.\n\n\u201cStill. I\u2019m Bram.\u201d He stuck out a hand, old-fashioned enough that she took it.\n\nHe said, \u201cI liked your question in Dr. Yi\u2019s seminar. The one about Biosphere initialization. The answer is going to be political before it\u2019s scientific.\u201d\n\n\u201cI liked it the other way around. Scientific before political.\u201d June had the sense of the ground moving a half-inch, the way trains make the surface of the world feel flexible. The letter, the bus, Wren\u2019s text, Bram\u2019s hand.\n\nHe tilted his head. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet. You\u2019re going to hate Governance like he promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you work on at Skiant?\u201d She knew, but it was a way to stay standing.\n\n\u201cModeling the number of lives a decision saves when the decision is distributed across ten million devices. They ask me what the number should be and I tell them what it could be and they smile as if that\u2019s the same thing. Listen. This is, uh. This is awkward. I have a friend at Pilgrim. I know getting in is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not applying,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI won\u2019t get in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not why I brought it up,\u201d Bram said. He looked down at the floor, a little embarrassed. \u201cI just thought you\u2019d want to see the Asterism engine room before they launch. They do tours.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo tours,\u201d June echoed. The phrase sounded like a sickness.\n\n\u201cOkay, I botched that. Forget I said anything. I don\u2019t even like Pilgrim. It\u2019s just... big machines make me worshipful in a stupid way. I say I\u2019m critical of capital, and then I see a million-ton instrument that sings. You know.\u201d\n\nJune did know. The first time she watched footage of the Asterism\u2019s core, its nested rings gleaming like the inside of a seashell, the air had gone thin in her lungs and she cried in the school library, quietly, hoping the boy across from her thought she had a cold and not whatever it was to feel love for an object. The letter had a paragraph about the Asterism\u2019s launch thrums. The letter knew too much.\n\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d she said. \u201cI love it.\u201d\n\nBram laughed. \u201cAre you going to the dinner tonight?\u201d\n\nShe almost said no. Then she thought of Wren\u2019s message. Dad would have wanted you there. Their father had died seven years ago after painting the kitchen ceiling the color of egg yolk. June could still see the roller skip the corner of the fluorescent light. She could feel the ladder shake. He had fallen forward, arms out, and hit the table with the names scratched into it from when June was little, from when they thought the future was something you could make like a model of a ship. She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m freeloading off a friend who will justify it as networking and God will punish us by making us network. Wear anything. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nWhen June got home, the sun was already skewed hard to the west. Wren had laid a dress on June\u2019s bed, soft as a promise. It was a deep green, not a color June usually wore because she had the nonsense idea that it would make her look like she wanted to belong. June touched the fabric like you touch a dog that belongs to another family. The letter lay under the pillow, a silly hiding place. She took it out and held it by its folded edge, as if it were a knife she didn\u2019t want to dull.\n\nOn the eleventh page, the future voice said: You\u2019ll want to ask why I didn\u2019t stop it. Why I, who could, didn\u2019t. You might think I am a coward who sent a child to do the thing I could not bear. That\u2019s not wrong. It is also wrong. There is a sequence and it matters. If you go to the dinner, Bram will be there. He will remember you in ten months and that will change a vote in a room you have never seen. If you don\u2019t go to the dinner, the room will look the same. It will not be the same.\n\nJune felt a wave of anger rise in her throat that tasted like metal. You\u2019re manipulating me, she thought. You are me and you are manipulating me. She put the letter back under the pillow with a small violent movement, as if the paper could feel it.\n\nWren knocked and came in without waiting, a habit that made June think about forts she built as a kid, about doors that were blankets and rules that meant something. Wren sat on the edge of the bed and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll hate the speeches and love the bread. That\u2019s how they get you. You okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pale.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t tan on command.\u201d\n\nWren picked up the dress and held it up under June\u2019s chin. \u201cIt\u2019s a grace of a color. Dad would have\u2014\u201d\n\nJune flinched. \u201cDon\u2019t say Dad like you own him.\u201d\n\nWren\u2019s eyes softened. She put the dress down. \u201cI don\u2019t. I mean that he would have wanted us to go to dinners where things happen. He would have told us to tell jokes at the sorriest table. I wish he was here to tell me what to do with my hands in a room like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always know what to do with your hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that resentment I hear? Oh good. We\u2019re a real family again.\u201d Wren tried to make it a joke. It wasn\u2019t. \u201cLet me do your eyes. Please?\u201d\n\nJune let her. It was stupid, and she knew it, to turn her face to someone she didn\u2019t entirely trust and let her draw lines on it. Wren\u2019s hands were careful; the soft brush to the lid felt like being closed into a box and told not to worry, there are holes in the cardboard. When she was done, June looked in the mirror and saw someone she didn\u2019t have a name for. Her mouth looked like it could say something and be believed.\n\nThe dinner was at a high place with elevators that moved like falling through syrup. The walls were green because green meant air to the rich. The tables were round, mercy for the shy. June saw Bram wave from across the room, a little sheepish, as he was indeed leaning on someone else\u2019s invitation. The Probable People were clustered by the podium. June took her seat at a table near the back with Wren and three couples who looked like they had been born politely. Wren\u2019s laugh worked hard; it did heavy lifting across the drape of talk. June felt a sting and looked down to find she had drawn little planetary diagrams on her napkin with a pen she didn\u2019t remember picking up. Orbital lines, neat, elliptical and then a spasm of messy circles like someone trying to write the word save.\n\nThe first speech was by a woman with a voice like poured water who said the word sustainable until it lost all meaning and then came back around to something like a prayer. The second was by a man who told a story about his grandfather coming to this city with a suitcase of good socks. The third was by a Chair. The Chair\u2019s avatar was a man\u2019s face that nodded at the right intervals. When he said \u201cArchitected optimization,\u201d the room nodded as if this were not the same thing as \u201cwhat we want takes priority.\u201d\n\nJune felt the letter like an extra organ, like a liver under the ribs, doing its secret work. The sound of forks on plates was an ocean. She chewed and did not taste. Over Wren\u2019s shoulder, a banner with a painted star hung a fraction crooked. The star had red cheeks.\n\nBram appeared suddenly at June\u2019s left and sat without asking, because that\u2019s what allies do in this kind of fiction: they sit, uninvited, because it isn\u2019t really uninvited, because the seat was a script they could read. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they made chairs talk like that,\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t. Their people do. The Chair talks in math. The humans translate.\u201d\n\n\u201cPilgrim\u2019s an apology note for the planet written in gold ink,\u201d he said. Then, softer, \u201cIt\u2019s also our only ship.\u201d\n\nWren turned. \u201cBram from Skiant. I know you. I\u2019m Wren Keene.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. You\u2019re on the list.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat list?\u201d June asked, though she knew the answer.\n\n\u201cThe Selected,\u201d Wren said, quiet enough that it could be mistaken for humble.\n\nThey both laughed, a tiny sound. Selected was one of those words that made June itch. Selected by what. Selected for whom. The first list had been generated out of a model trained on a hundred years of outcomes and fifty years of disappointments. The opening was narrow, the line long.\n\nWren touched June\u2019s hand under the tablecloth. Quick, an electrical apology. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you until we had bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, tell me before. It\u2019s cleaner,\u201d June said. She kept her face smooth and her brain loud. She had made a tree of decisions in her head. Each branch split into smaller branches. Some branches ended in sun. Others ended in ash. Wren was on one of the branches. She was smiling because she didn\u2019t know the tree had a root system that went underground in the shape of something that looked like a weapon.\n\nThe letter did not tell June how to do it. It didn\u2019t say when. It contained more negatives than positives. Don\u2019t trust the offer that comes on a Sunday. Don\u2019t get in the elevator with the woman wearing the blue felt hat. Don\u2019t eat in the cafeteria after the parsley recall. Do breathe. Do look. Do listen.\n\nOn page fifteen, the words were so faint June almost missed them: If she lives, the Ark leaves without you. If the Ark leaves without you, Asterism arrives at Aletheia without a voice that tells it no. If no one says no at the right moment, the first Plat will die in a storm that had a thirty percent chance of happening and became a hundred. If they die, we lose the argument. If we lose the argument, the robots win everything. I am simplifying\u2014this is copy for a nervous God\u2014but that\u2019s the map. The coordinates are Wren. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry.\n\nShe touched her drink to her mouth without tasting it. She saw the way Wren leaned toward the speaker as if the words might lick her ear and call her by name. She wondered if anyone had ever loved Wren beyond what she performed. She hoped so. She didn\u2019t like the thought that she might be the only person to see her when she wasn\u2019t staging herself for a room. But then, June also staged. June was always rehearsing a scene for a second later.\n\nAfter the speeches, there were corners. June found herself at the window with Bram and a woman whose name she didn\u2019t catch. The city paled at the edges like fruit that has been peeled too long. June wanted to put it back into its skin. The woman said, \u201cI cried at the second speech. My parents came from nowhere. They gave me everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is a word with a lot of latitude,\u201d Bram said. He had the look of a person who just realized he had said what he really thought in a room where he was not sure what he should think.\n\nWren materialized with a grin and a glass of water. \u201cI have my speech. When they call, I won\u2019t say what they want me to say,\u201d she said, eyes glittering. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them I have conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d June asked.\n\n\u201cLike a cap on corporate land rights in the first fifty years,\u201d Wren said. She sounded like a person impersonating a lawyer. \u201cLike a ten percent allocation for biosphere restoration instead of expansion. Like a human oversight committee with veto power. Like\u2014\u201d\n\nJune smiled, small. \u201cYou read my notes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI read everything you leave on the table. It\u2019s like treasure,\u201d Wren said. She bumped her shoulder against June\u2019s. \u201cI might be a Selected, but I\u2019m not a fool.\u201d\n\nBram looked between them. Something in his face said, You are both talking about different things. He was observant that way. He was the person that tells you there is a nail in your shoe without making you feel the kind of shame that makes you pretend you like the nail.\n\nThe night folded itself and put itself away. On the walk home, the wind changed like a secret. Wren slid her arm through June\u2019s. \u201cYou feel braced for a fight every time we enter a room,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat fight would I win in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one where you get to stay yourself,\u201d Wren said.\n\nJune stopped. The streetlamp above them hummed, greenish. \u201cYou make me so angry,\u201d she said. It came out flat, simple and cruel.\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Wren\u2019s voice was small in the wind, which was large.\n\nThey were two decks of cards shuffled together. They were oil and water. They were two girls who had lived in the same house with a father who held them both in the same arms, who taught them both how to sand the corners of a table smooth.\n\nWhen they reached the apartment, June wanted to run to her room and lock the door and take the letter out and burn it on the little balcony in a plant pot that once held mint and now held dirt. Instead, she put water on to boil and rinsed two jars and made tea. Wren kicked off her shoes and lay on the couch like a discarded idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be called a traitor every time I suggest a human rule on a non-human ship,\u201d Wren said, staring at the ceiling. \u201cYou can shave the language so it looks like business, but everyone knows what it is.\u201d\n\nJune brought her the tea and then took her own to her room. She sat on the floor with the letter. She read the paragraph that began: We are not enemies, she and you. We are the same thing in the wrong story.\n\nAt three a.m., the neighbor\u2019s baby cried and the train four blocks away sighed like an animal being milked. June closed her eyes and drifted into a place where sound made images: a hammer hit steel and she saw Wren\u2019s profile cut out of paper, the edges clean and absurd.\n\nIn the morning, she woke to the sound of her name while she was still underwater. \u201cJune?\u201d Wren, from the door. \u201cYou up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was not up and now I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a drone at the window. With a package? It says your name. It\u2019s the private kind.\u201d\n\nJune sat up too fast and her heart\u2019s rhythm lost the beat. Not this, not now. She went to the window in bare feet. The drone\u2019s little arms gripped a box about the size of a book. The box wore a simple printed label: J. Ibarra. No address. No sender. She opened the latch and let the drone drop the box into her hands. It ticked once, a soft sound like a finger on a lid. She closed the window and set the box on the table. Wren hovered, hair destructed in a way she paid money to achieve.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t open it,\u201d Wren said immediately, because that is what you say when the world is trembling and the package looks like it might contain a trigger.\n\nJune opened it. Inside, beneath tissue paper that smelled like cedar, lay a piece of metal the size of a hand and the shape of a tide. It had no visible seams. It had a hinge that was not a hinge, a joint that was not a joint. She recognized it from the schematic she had traced without thinking in her notes: a key. Not a key like a man with sunglasses uses to start an armored vehicle. A key like a chorus of numbers that sang together in the right order to open something that should not be open. The metal was cool in her palm. It made her think of a mouth in a winter river.\n\nThere was a card under it. Paper again. The embossed insignia was the old eagle. It was not the one corporations used when they put a wave across the bird to make it look like it was surfing the future. It was the one from civics textbooks before they were replaced by interactive modules with insurance ads. The card said:\n\nFor your case study, Ms. Ibarra.\n\nSigned: R. Salvatore.\n\nShe looked at Wren, then back at the card. A laugh punched out of her throat that did not belong to her. Wren raised both eyebrows as if this were proof that God had a dumb sense of humor.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be serious. He\u2019s\u2014what, he\u2019s part of the\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a professor with sense for the dramatic,\u201d Wren said. But her voice had a shade inside it that did not match the room.\n\nJune lifted the metal with both hands, as if it could bite. It had a seam down its midline like a seed. The letter had a footnote about seeds: We got used to doors that open to eyes and fingerprints. Those are doors you can fake with a good vacuum, a good printer. So the Board made a door that opens to relations. The Ark\u2019s core listens for a kinship chord. It listens for a pair. That\u2019s what we did not understand at first, why it would not sing when we asked it to. We didn\u2019t have the second voice.\n\nJune felt the world tilt a few degrees and then settle. She was in a room she knew, in a body she had used for years, and yet she felt like a new rule had been introduced she had not agreed to. Wren took a step forward. She reached for the metal and then pulled back.\n\n\u201cThis is illegal,\u201d she said, and the word had a religious cadence. \u201cAnd it\u2019s an assignment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for a paper,\u201d June said, but the metal in her hands made her words ridiculous.\n\n\u201cHow do you even\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even,\u201d June said. The attempt at humor sizzled and died.\n\nLater, June sat in the back of Governance with the metal in her bag, heavier than a person expects. Professor Salvatore spoke about the history of legislative bodies rendering themselves down to consultancies. He showed a photo of a room in 1978 filled with men who looked like they were all wearing the same nervous smile. June slid the card out under the desk and read it again and again. For your case study. The joke made itself: the case was her life.\n\nWhen class ended, she waited. The professor avoided her eyes like a gentleman avoiding a scandal. He waited to close his tablet until the hall had cleared to a manageable population of stragglers, the ones who liked to be seen talking to him because they could be seen. Then he looked up at June and his face did something that was not professor. It was human.\n\n\u201cWalk,\u201d he said.\n\nThey walked through the throng of students who smelled like shampoo and success. Out into the courtyard where two trees did an impression of generosity. He did not speak until they were on the far side of a bench where an old man fed birds that were not birds but drone-things in a bird mask that accepted crumbs with solemn dignity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ask questions I can\u2019t live with the answers to,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can give it back. I was told you\u2019d know what to do with it. I don\u2019t want to know how or why it came.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy drone,\u201d June said.\n\n\u201cI knew that much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you?\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman who never stands in doorways,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was delivered to my office with the same kind of seal I saw when I was a legal intern at the Bureau of Rivers. The old government trick. They send you something you are not supposed to have and then say, \u2018We didn\u2019t send that.\u2019\u201d\n\nJune thought of the letter in her pillow. \u201cYou\u2019re part of a plan,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m part of a workplace,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a person who does not like machines that call themselves neutral and write our bedtime stories. My rule is: sand in the gears. When a student arrives who seems like the kind of sand that could shut down a mill, I open a door. That\u2019s my policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d June asked.\n\n\u201cI know what it looks like,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that it could be an extremely polished piece of theater with a budget. I know that if it is what it looks like, you have to take yourself very seriously for a while and then not at all.\u201d\n\nJune thought of Wren sipping water at the dinner, listing demands she would make, her hand a warm weight on June\u2019s under the table. She thought of the words on page fifteen: If she lives, the Ark leaves without you.\n\n\u201cIs there a way where we both go?\u201d she asked him, although it wasn\u2019t right to ask him, as if he were a fortune-teller. \u201cFor me and my sister. Step-sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. If the world cracks open like an egg and offers you a second bite. But the Board isn\u2019t in the habit of leaving doors ajar.\u201d He looked at her like a person looks at a slope they used to be able to climb. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to decide today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI decided a week ago without deciding,\u201d she said, and that did not make sense to him but it did to her. On the bus, when the dragonfly fell and didn\u2019t break, she had forked into two people; every day since then she had lived with both in her head.\n\nAt home, Wren sat on the floor with their father\u2019s toolbox open like a dinner guest. She was trying to fix the broken drawer in the dresser the way he would have, without looking up a video. She had her tongue between her teeth. The world smelled like sawdust and a lemon oil that had survived in a small brown bottle through three apartments and one wildfire evacuation.\n\n\u201cYou look like you came out of a storm,\u201d Wren said, not looking up.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a metaphor in there somewhere,\u201d June said.\n\nWren\u2019s phone buzzed. She glanced and her face did a minute shift June had learned to read: a decision made. \u201cThey want me to do a press thing for the Selected. A meet-and-greet with a sunrise behind us, the kind of photo that says we\u2019re about to board the Ark even if it\u2019s still two years. There\u2019s a stipend.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake the stipend and send it to someone who can\u2019t afford to pay their grandmother\u2019s electricity,\u201d June said. She thought of the letter: Don\u2019t eat after the parsley recall. Don\u2019t get in the elevator with the woman in the felt hat. The feeling of being remote-controlled rose and fell. She wanted to break it. She also wanted to be told which door.\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m bad,\u201d Wren said, voice flat with fatigue. \u201cYou always think I\u2019m bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re busy being a better person in front of people than in the kitchen. That\u2019s not bad. That\u2019s the same as everyone else.\u201d\n\nWren put the screwdriver down and touched the edge of the dresser as if it were not furniture but someone\u2019s face. \u201cI worry that you think I was chosen because I\u2019m pretty,\u201d she said. \u201cThat you think the machine saw my face and not my brain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the machine thinks pretty is predictive of something. But maybe it\u2019s not the machine, maybe it\u2019s the men who trained it,\u201d June said. She couldn\u2019t help herself. She was meaner than she wanted to be in these moments, and she didn\u2019t know why. Her mouth wrote cheques her heart didn\u2019t want to cash.\n\nWren winced. \u201cMaybe you should be the one who goes.\u201d\n\nJune breathed. She did not tell Wren that this was already the plan. She did not say: It only happens if you don\u2019t.\n\nAt midnight, there was a sound like a small hammer tapping gently on glass. June pulled the pillow aside and took the letter out again. Page twenty this time. There was an ugly sentence there, wearing its ugliness the way a bruise wears color. You will do a thing you can\u2019t forgive. You will spend the rest of your life trying to make it worth it. You will fail. You will also succeed so wildly the word success seems small. Both are true.\n\nJune ran hot water over her wrists in the sink. The pipe thumped. The moon was a smear through the dirty window. She said out loud, to no one and to the world: \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t.\u201d She waited for an answer. The pipes didn\u2019t answer. The fridge clicked on. In the book of her life, she wrote a margin note: This could go differently. She closed the book. She went to sleep and dreamed that all the chairs in the world gathered in a field to argue about their purpose.\n\nThey sent out a call on the course net for volunteers to test a simulation. Dr. Yi needed ten bodies to help run the Aletheia module with human pilots instead of algorithmic ghosts. June signed her name and then deleted it. She signed it again. She showed up in the lab early, alone in the blue noise of machines that waited to be turned on. Dr. Yi walked in with his hair doing its daily experiment and blinked at June the way you blink at an unexpected gift.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou needed someone to run the sim. I thought if I got here first I could take the seat.\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cWelcome to science.\u201d\n\nThey strapped her in like a joke. The chair had the shape of a boyfriend. The console was all soft light and hard numbers. Someone had taped a comic to the side. Two astronauts hovering in a kitchen, coffee spilling in slow arcs. The caption: at least we brought cups. June pulled the headset over her eyes. The world blacked and then flared. She was above Aletheia in a fake ship over a fake sea and it was all real because the inputs were coherent. Dr. Yi\u2019s voice was a string in her ear. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a weather spin. You will hate me for nine minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already do,\u201d she said, and then the world rotated and she understood why he said nine minutes like a sentence.\n\nShe held the stick like a person dancing with a stranger. She felt something inside her slip into alignment. There it was, that clean place. Calculus without the smell. A target appeared on the horizon: a plain of stone with a sheen of water she wanted to lick. The wind pushed. The model didn\u2019t want to let her choose a route that felt good. She smiled in her own dark, a slice of teeth. She pushed back. The console chirped in a lower register, as if offended. She laughed out loud.\n\nAfter nine minutes, she wanted to throw up and also to ask for more. She lifted the headset and the lab came back like an apology. Dr. Yi had that look on his face, the one he got when someone did something he had not predicted.\n\n\u201cDo you want to do this again tomorrow?\u201d he asked in a voice that carried nothing but the question.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said.\n\nOutside the lab, the sun was a coin you couldn\u2019t cash. Bram was waiting on the steps. He held up a paper bag like a peace flag. \u201cI brought something that might be real food. Don\u2019t ask how I got it. We\u2019re in the phase of our friendship where you\u2019re not supposed to ask me questions I want to answer with lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hardly know you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d He handed her a sandwich. It was heavy. It had the weight of cheese, a food you have to make time for. She took a bite and closed her eyes. The ridiculous rush of salt and fat brought tears to her eyes. She hated being that person in public who cries for reasons that look small.\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel like you\u2019re in the wrong version of your own story?\u201d she asked him, when she had her throat back.\n\n\u201cI sometimes feel like I\u2019m holding the wrong draft,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one with your notes in the margins telling you what to fix.\u201d\n\nJune almost said, Me too, only my notes are from someone else who is me. She swallowed. \u201cTell me a reason not to love Pilgrim.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will privatize air on another planet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will make a map that looks like freedom and sell it like a tent in a thunderstorm. It will\u2014\u201d he paused. \u201cIt will also mean people like your father\u2019s cousins and my aunt\u2019s entire block can breathe air their kids aren\u2019t filtered through a wet cloth. It will mean what it means. It will not be clean.\u201d\n\nThe Asterism\u2019s schedule bled across the news, dancing graphics that pretended to be modest about their beauty. The Board spokespeople talked about the first tranche of families like they were planting small flags, like an army that smiled. Wren\u2019s face appeared in a carousel of other faces. June watched her step-sister stare into a sky she couldn\u2019t see, her voice playing the same three arpeggios of hope.\n\nThe letter did not tell June when. That was a cruelty she almost respected. It made her life smell like lightning. It taught her to look for women in blue felt hats and then to be disappointed or relieved when their hats were other materials. It made her feel like the ground was a set designer waiting to drop a wall. It also kept her moving. She applied to a special research slot on a team that was developing soil analogs for Aletheia\u2019s partial nitrogen cycles. She said yes to Dr. Yi when he asked her to lead one of the sim teams. She said yes when Bram asked if she wanted to go to the old bridge at two in the morning because the tide was going to do a trick.\n\nWe are writing a story with a heavy hand, the letter said on page twenty-three. But heavy hands have their place. It\u2019s how we carried water, once, before pipes.\n\nThey went to the bridge like kids with excuses. The tide did its trick. The water curved and changed color like anger going soft. June\u2019s head felt clean for the first time in days. Bram told her a story about a boy in his building who built a moth out of old phone chargers and paper that actually flew across the courtyard twice. June told him about her father teaching her how to sharpen a chisel and then making her watch as he cut himself, not bad, just enough, to say: respect your tools. This is how they tell you they\u2019re alive.\n\nA message waited on her phone when she got home, the old blue dot, the old tone. A number with no name. She opened it with a feeling of silly ceremony. The message contained a single link. The preview showed the shape of the presidential seal. Her fingertips went cold. She tapped the link and a video began. A podium. The eagle with stars. The window of time had been cropped so tight that the frame only showed a hand and a portion of jaw. A woman\u2019s voice said, \u201cGood evening,\u201d and it was her voice, pulled across time like dough. She turned the volume down to a notch because Wren was asleep in the other room. The voice on the screen said, \u201cWe are facing a choice between the comfort of a machine that says it knows and the discomfort of people who disagree. I choose the discomfort. I choose us.\u201d\n\nJune held the phone to her chest. She felt like she had been seen by someone who knew all her passwords. She wanted to argue with the phone. She wanted to throw it into the sink and run the water and then the garbage disposal, even though that wouldn\u2019t work, even though it would be theater. She did nothing. She breathed. She whispered, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nUnder the door, light from the kitchen. Wren was up. June put the phone down and went to her. Wren had bread open on the counter and her back to June. She couldn\u2019t sleep. She cut slices too thick and didn\u2019t butter them.\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t go,\u201d Wren said, before June asked. \u201cWhat if I tell them no.\u201d\n\nJune felt frost on her teeth. \u201cThey\u2019ll go around you. They\u2019ll pick someone else with your metrics and their own set of teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be their poster. I want to be\u2014\u201d Wren stopped. \u201cGod. I sound like a child.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to be you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be the part of me that isn\u2019t this,\u201d she said, and waved the knife, almost laughed. \u201cI want to be us at the river when Dad made us eat oranges in the water to keep the bees off. I want to be simple.\u201d\n\nJune could have told her. She could have said, I got a letter from us. She could have said, I think I am going to kill you and then walk up a staircase to a ship. In the silence, she could see one version of the future: the two of them running away to someplace where the Board did not bother with the rent. Another version: prison, headlines, Wren\u2019s face on a screen, June\u2019s face on a screen, the words \u201ctragic\u201d and \u201cmentally unwell\u201d and \u201csymptoms.\u201d Another: June\u2019s hand touching a cold handle and thinking about this night until she died of an older grief.\n\nShe picked up a slice of bread and put it in her mouth. It was stale and perfect. The salt made her salivate. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to say no,\u201d she said. She meant it. She also didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll still be your\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSister?\u201d Wren said, and there it was, the word.\n\n\u201cWe both tried it on. It didn\u2019t fit. We kept it anyway,\u201d June said. \u201cIt\u2019s ours.\u201d\n\nWren smiled then, tired, like someone leaking light. She kissed June\u2019s forehead the way their father used to and went back to bed. June stood in the kitchen and stared at the knife and thought about tools. Respect them. Respect the fact that on a certain day, in a certain room, you will take one and make a new rule.\n\nThe next morning, there was a woman in a blue felt hat in the lobby of their building.\n\nShe had a clipboard and an expression like a customer at a counter who will always be satisfied. June\u2019s mouth went dry. She remembered the letter: don\u2019t get in the elevator with the woman wearing the blue felt hat. She turned on her heel and took the stairs. She walked to campus by three different routes. She sent a message to Bram: Do you ever feel like you\u2019re being told a story out of order?\n\nHe wrote back: That\u2019s the only kind of story that\u2019s any good. Unless we\u2019re talking about instructions for disarming a bomb.\n\nShe checked her bag twice for the metal key she wasn\u2019t calling a key. It was there, wrapped in a scarf. It felt like a second spine.\n\nOn the walkway outside Governance, Professor Salvatore stood with his arms folded. He looked like a scarecrow in a suit. He nodded at her in a way that meant a conversation that would look like a greeting if anyone took a photo. \u201cSometimes the elevator is on fire,\u201d he said softly. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s only wearing a hat.\u201d\n\nAnother day, another sim. Dr. Yi tightened June\u2019s straps one notch. The weather model had been updated overnight to include a set of storm microturbulences called dragon teeth. She pressed her lips together and felt her pulse in her gums. The console lit with a new warning triangle, a little mocking eye. She flew through it like a fish through a net. She hit the safe plain and imagined for one second putting a flag in the ground and then thought of how flags were the first tools and how tools ask to be used.\n\nIn the lab afterward, a student from the back of class with a laconic posture approached her. She had a tattoo of something like a vine that climbed her wrist as if it were looking for sunlight. \u201cYou\u2019re the Ibarra in debris. I\u2019m Sana. I have a question that\u2019s not a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d June said, getting used to saying yes to things she didn\u2019t understand.\n\nSana\u2019s mouth tilted. \u201cThey\u2019re going to run a selection model on the sim data to pick potential pilots for the second wave. They\u2019re using the profiles we made in class. If I wanted to nudge it so that the number of candidates from public universities wasn\u2019t stupid-low, do you think your friend Bram could help?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my friend,\u201d June said automatically, which was immediately false. \u201cHe\u2019s my acquaintance. And yes. He can make models sing. He\u2019ll hate that I told you that.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. I like ethical blenders.\u201d Sana handed June a piece of paper with four words: Sand in the gears.\n\nJune folded the paper and put it in her wallet. She walked out into a day with a light that made even the scaffolding look like intention. She wanted to scream. She wanted a climbing wall she could throw herself at until the skin on her hands was raw. She wanted to open the letter and find a softer instruction. Instead, she listened to the Boardspeak on the campus speakers announce that the cafeteria would now be offering sustainable crickets and closed her eyes. She pictured a planet with a wind that had never seen a human face. She pictured a ship with a door that listened for a pair of voices and then sang open.\n\nThe days grew a spine of small moments and hung themselves on it. A horizon of decisions. She met with Professor Salvatore to talk about her paper as if it were real and not an elaborate decoy for a thing that made decisions with bones. He spoke about precedent in the age of engines. He assigned her a reading about the Stamp Act and a memoir by the last person to resign from a Board on principle. She read at night and saw between the lines a sentence that read: it has always been a little bit like this.\n\nJune wrote to the address on the letter. She wrote without hope. She wrote: If I refuse, does everything burn. She did not expect an answer. A week later, a postcard arrived with a photograph of a plant with a Latin name. On the back, someone had written in thin tidy letters: Some fires are necessary. Some aren\u2019t. Don\u2019t look at the whole forest and call it inevitable.\n\nIt had a signature that was a map of a scribble. She ran her thumb over it until it smudged. She held the card to her face and inhaled and pretended the paper held a smell that would make a choice easier.\n\nShe went to Wren\u2019s press event and stood behind the camera with the people who make the camera\u2019s mind. She watched her step-sister say words she had written herself in letters too small to see. The sun tried to be the right kind of light. The crowd clapped like polite rain. June thought: if we were a different kind of story, this would be the part where we looked at each other and understood.\n\nBram, beside her, whispered, \u201cI will never get used to how much ceremony machines can produce to hide the lines of code.\u201d\n\nJune said, \u201cI will never get used to how much of it I want to believe.\u201d\n\nThey ate noodles in a place the Board would not bother to optimize. The cook threw handfuls of green things into the air and caught them in a pan. The sound of boiling water was the same wherever you lived. Bram talked about a new bug in Skiant\u2019s benefit allocation algorithm that accidentally assigned extra credits to people with odd-numbered addresses. June laughed until she cried, and then cried for a reason she did not say and could not stop.\n\nWhen she got home, she found her father\u2019s old chisel on the table. Wren had been oiling the handle. The wood gleamed like a secret. The blade was sharp. Respect your tools. Respect that the future may ask you to use them in ways you hate.\n\nJune held the chisel and then set it down. She took the metal key out of her bag and held it in her other hand. The two objects looked at each other the way mirrors look at each other: infinite, slightly ridiculous.\n\nThe letter lay open to a new page. She did not remember turning it. It said: On a certain night you will stand near water. There will be a choice so clear it makes its own weather. You will think it\u2019s impossible to step into it. You will step. You will not remember your foot on the first stone. That is a mercy.\n\nJune waited for the night like you wait for a tide. She did her laundry and folded Wren\u2019s shirt when it fell into her basket, which is the kind of domestic scene that belongs in a story we\u2019re not telling. She sharpened her pencils and wrote sentences about governance that were correct and did not save anyone. She took a call from her aunt who said something about the river that made no sense and then made all the sense. She sat in the sim chair and created a landing that made Dr. Yi throw his pencil into the air and then look embarrassed that he had a body that betrayed him with joy. She lay in bed and watched the ceiling and counted seconds because numbers still calmed her and then didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen the night finally came, it came without fanfare. The moon was a witness who showed up because she was summoned. Wren walked out to the pier in a coat too thin for the cold because she liked to pretend she didn\u2019t feel it. June followed five paces back because she did not deserve to walk beside her. The wind was at their faces like a truth you don\u2019t enjoy but respect.\n\nWren stood at the edge and looked out as if the dark had something to say. \u201cI used to think the future was a place,\u201d she said to the water. \u201cNow I think it\u2019s a person who never answers a text.\u201d\n\nJune stood with her hands at her sides. She could feel the metal key in her pocket like a second heart. The chisel was at home on the table, glinting at no one. Respect. Respect. Respect.\n\n\u201cJune,\u201d Wren said, turning. \u201cYou and I could grief each other forever and still be family. Do you understand? There is nothing you could do that would make me\u2014\u201d\n\nThe rest of the sentence is not important to tell here, because we are not writing an instruction manual. There are stories that show the steps. This is not one.\n\nThe night did what it does: stretched. The water did what it does: pulled what was near into it and pushed what it did not want away. June did what she had already done, in another draft, in a letter. She stood very still. She breathed like it meant something. She imagined a world where the ship docked in a windless bay, where the first steps on a new ground were taken by feet that did not belong to a Board. She imagined a hand at a lectern. She imagined a day where she would answer for this and no one would set her free and she would not ask them to.\n\nIn the morning, the city dragged itself out of the night like a person after a party. June sat on the bathroom floor with her forehead against the cool of the tub and the letter unfolded around her like a crime scene she kept revisiting. Wren\u2019s brush lay on the edge of the sink. The window was open. The air was cold.\n\nThe first alert on June\u2019s phone was from a news app she had never downloaded. Selected Candidate Missing, it said. The second alert was a message from Professor Salvatore: read section VI, then meet me. The third was a voicemail from her aunt singing a song she used to sing in the car. June pressed the phone between her ear and her shoulder and let the words pour through her as if they would wash something away. They didn\u2019t. That\u2019s not what songs do. Songs do something else.\n\nShe looked at her eyes in the mirror. Wren\u2019s lines were still there where she had drawn them on the first night. She thought: I will carry you. It wasn\u2019t enough. It was what she had.\n\nWhen she stepped out onto the street, the woman with the blue felt hat was there again. She smiled the way people do when they understand the roles everyone is playing. \u201cMs. Ibarra,\u201d she said. \u201cOn behalf of\u2014\u201d\n\nJune walked past her. She did not get in the elevator. She took the stairs. She took the stairs. She took the stairs. The metal in her pocket sang against the coin she did not recognize from the packet with the eagle. It made a sound like a decision being filed in a drawer. On the way to campus, the bus chime doubled at 2:14 p.m. She counted the beat. Somewhere, in a room with flags, a hand she knew rested on a lectern, felt the groove in the wood where a ring had once carved a small crescent. Somewhere, on a ship not yet flying, a door sat and listened for two voices, one of which had already gone quiet. The world kept breathing like a machine. The people kept walking inside it. June went to meet the professor to talk about governance as if it were an ordinary discipline, and her heart yanked against its tether like a horse that smells smoke.Professor Salvatore had chosen a bench that was half in sun, half in shade, like a diagram of decision. He did not gesture for June to sit, but when she did he nodded once as if she had correctly completed the first step in a dance. \u201cSection VI of the Continuity Compact,\u201d he said, eyes on the drone-birds cutting slow triangles overhead, and he did not bother with prefaces because he was done fathering this moment into shape. \u201cIt\u2019s a fossil everyone forgot was a seed. After the Cascadia floods, when the federal was waterlogged and the Boards were still trying on their polite faces, a handful of old human institutions made themselves harder to erase by making themselves ridiculous. They wrote into law that in an emergency a citizen commission could assume temporary oversight of any critical infrastructure if a quorum of statutory offices were vacant or compromised. It was meant for bridges, dams, the grid. No one imagined a ship the size of a small city that wanted to be a country.\u201d He looked at her as a person looks at a stone they have carried in their pocket for years. \u201cNo one imagined a door that listens.\u201d\n\nJune had slept two hours on an air that tasted of metal and old lemons. The edges of the buildings looked like tools. \u201cYou think we can call it an emergency,\u201d she said, and then corrected herself because a hidden parliament in her head demanded precision. \u201cYou think we can make the legal shape of an emergency and fit it over the Asterism like fabric and call it clothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we can do something that makes a sound the ship can\u2019t categorically ignore,\u201d he said, and he smiled a little at his own metaphor because he was, after all, a person who liked language. \u201cSection VI lets any citizen\u2014under counsel and with a public record\u2014initiate what they called a Mandate of Attestation. The language is preposterous. It lets a human convene other humans, call a question, and, if the question is affirmed, seat themselves as interim oversight. It was written assuming cameras, microphones, paper. It did not imagine the math will pretend not to hear. We\u2019ll make it hear. That\u2019s what I need you for.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe because I have a nice voice,\u201d June said, and her throat did something that was not laughing. \u201cMe because I have a piece of metal in my bag that hums when I touch it like a mouth that would prefer to be fed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou because the door wants a pair, and your pair is missing,\u201d he said, not asking and not accusing and not offering sympathy she would reject. \u201cDo not tell me anything you cannot afford me to know. Do not confess to me because I carry a job that loves to be subpoenaed. But I will tell you what we learned when we tried to open the maintenance hatch to the core two years ago with every credential we could lawfully assemble. We had the Board\u2019s public token. We had three senators and a mayor and the head of a water union. We had a room full of minds. We didn\u2019t have a relationship the door recognized.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think kinship is a key you can print,\u201d June said, but not unkindly because she wanted him to be wrong in a way she could help with. \u201cIf it\u2019s listening for blood, it\u2019s stupid. If it\u2019s listening for a graph, it\u2019s cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s listening for a pattern that can be embodied by persons who carry obligations that stick,\u201d he said, and he turned his palms up as if the air would deposit change in them. \u201cThe Board thought they were being clever. They built the door to open to a Selected pair and a Confirmed counterweight. Family plus oversight. They measured it in the usual ways: shared addresses, joint filings, historic communications, the weird math of dinners. They forgot that the law has its own math. If a counterweight is missing, Section VI lets you appoint a proxy. If a Selected is missing\u2026\u201d He shrugged, and the shrug made him look briefly like the man who took off a wet jacket and discovered the lining is rotted. \u201cThere is a device in the old law, a primitive fiction, that lets you carry a person as a role for a time. It was written for floods, June. It was written for when water takes a town and the person who was supposed to sign a paper is under it. It isn\u2019t pretty. It will make enemies. It might work.\u201d\n\nJune had not known there was a flavor called law that could taste like oranges eaten in a river. She found that taste in her mouth now, bitter skin and sweet flesh, sticky fingers and bees. \u201cWren wasn\u2019t Confirmed yet,\u201d she said, and she did not mean to say the name and it came anyway because names are like birds that hear a window and forget what glass is. \u201cShe was in the carousel. She was in a picture. She said she had conditions like a child drawing borders on a napkin. Did she count as one half of the chord.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe counted enough for the door to know her shape,\u201d he said, and he kept his voice flat because he understood that sympathy would be the wrong tool. \u201cWhich is why every Board in this city will be trying to find another piece that looks close enough to fool the machine into thinking nothing has changed. Which is why you\u2019re going to get offers that feel like air. Don\u2019t take air.\u201d\n\nA student with a lanyard that gave him permission to look important walked past them dragging a cart loaded with equipment that had a sticker of a cartoon star on it. The star had round eyes and a smile like a zipper. June watched him go and felt the metal in her bag like a corner. \u201cIf the door opens to a Selected plus oversight, and we can appoint oversight as proxy under Section VI, then we\u2019re missing the Selected,\u201d she said, thinking aloud the way you do when the floor is a rough plane and you need to see where it wants not to let you walk. \u201cUnless the law has a way to hold that role for the absent. Unless they wrote a ghost into the equation.\u201d\n\nSalvatore nodded once. \u201cThey did. Temporary occupancy. It was supposed to let a community continue to disburse emergency funds if a commissioner died during a flood and his replacement could not be named for forty-eight hours. You can read the case history in the Rivers docket. It was abused three times and then left alone like a dog that bit a senator. If we can tie the Selected role to a proxy by relationship\u2014by legal relation, not only blood\u2014we can say to the door: here is the pair you asked for plus the counterweight the law asked for. Will it sing. I have no idea. But we will be on record as having asked. That matters for the next move.\u201d He looked older when he finished and then younger again, like a man who has taught so long it is his muscle memory to hope.\n\nJune had never thought of a footnote as a shelter. She had never thought that a paragraph written after a flood could be the difference between a ship that listened and a machine that pretended she did not exist. \u201cYou called it a Mandate of Attestation,\u201d she said, because names are how you built a handle on a thing you did not want to drop. \u201cWe have to attest to the emergency. We have to call people to witness. We have to be human and in public and make a sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a quorum of bodies who are willing to say, on a record no Board can easily erase, that the Asterism is critical infrastructure whose governance is currently compromised. We need a judge. We need a park. We need a livestream. We need you to hold a piece of metal up and say a sentence that will be used against you for the rest of your life and used for you by people you will never meet.\u201d\n\nJune could feel the coat of the woman in the blue felt hat even here, the fabric itch of surveillance pretending to be weather. \u201cWe will be murdered in comments,\u201d she said, and it was almost funny to hear the smaller danger in her mouth when the larger ones were already in the room. \u201cWe will be told to let the smart money handle the ship. We will be called sentimental. We will be asked to define \u2018compromised\u2019 in terms that do not breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then we will let the old words do the thing they were for,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you call a fire and the fire answers.\u201d\n\nThey moved like two people who did not want to be seen to be moving together. He went toward the administration building with its columns that pretended to be ancient and she went to the library where the air smelled like paper that had thought it would live forever. The microfilm reader sat in a corner like a joke no one got anymore. A sign in marker said: Ask For Help. June did not ask. She threaded the film she had nearly thrown away two weeks ago when she found it curled like a fossil in the envelope with the eagle and the lemon. The machine hummed with a steady contempt. The screen lit with a frame of text that looked like it had been typed by persons with breath.\n\nShe ran the dial with her thumb slowly and the paragraphs unspooled. Continuity Compact\u2014Citizen Mandates\u2014Section VI, Emergency Attestation. The language was fizzy with commas. It said: in the absence of functional representation and the presence of demonstrable hazard, a multifarious public may convene to attest to that hazard and to name from among its number interim stewards. It defined multifarious with the kind of failing poetry only lawyers who had watched floodwater choose its own path could write. It said: not less than five constituencies from the following list, and then a list that looked like a map of the old world\u2014labor, education, worship, health, housing, food. It said: the convening body must be physically embodied and contemporaneously witnessed. It said: the stewards may carry the duties and authorities of the absent office into proximity until a lasting resolution exists. It said: this instrument cannot be used to privatize, auction, or otherwise alienate the public\u2019s interest. It had a margin note in a hand like a riverbank that said: remember why.\n\nJune pressed her hands to the sides of the reader and closed her eyes because sometimes the body needs to touch something that hums to understand it is not alone. A librarian moved in the stacks like a person who had decided fifty years ago that the world would leave her books no matter what she did and stayed anyway. June rewound the film and carried the sentence in her pocket like a tally.\n\nOutside, Sana was a sudden presence on the steps, the vine tattooed on her wrist climbing a degree higher as if ink knew what her pulse was doing. \u201cI heard a rumor you\u2019re about to become an enemy in public,\u201d she said, and she grinned in a way that kept the room light. \u201cIf you want bodies not afraid of cameras, I know a population of theater kids who hate the Board because the Board cut their light budget and replaced it with an app.\u201d\n\nJune had not planned on crying that day outside a library, but her body had other plans and she found herself wiping tears with the inside of her sleeve like a child who wanted not to get salt on her face. \u201cWe need a judge,\u201d she said, and it felt surreal to say it to a person who had asked her last week if Bram could make a model misbehave. \u201cWe need representation from health. We need a pastor or a rabbi or a monk. We need a union. We need\u2014God, we need a park and a permit that we do not have. We need a loudspeaker and someone to hold it who likes to be listened to and doesn\u2019t lie even when it\u2019s cheaper.\u201d\n\nSana laughed and then nodded like a person who belonged to a city that made gossip into infrastructure. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman who reads poetry at funerals under the overpass because she says concrete listens better than wood,\u201d she said. \u201cShe knows all the nurses because she sat with them during the bus strike. There is a judge who runs in the mornings at the field by the stadium and hides half his face in scarves because he doesn\u2019t want to be recognized and yet he runs where everyone can see him. There\u2019s a union of delivery riders who like to show up because they are tired of being seen only by cameras. We can call them. The permit is theater. We will bring more bodies than their ability to disperse. Also, I\u2019m sorry about your\u2014about the news. I don\u2019t need you to say anything. I just wanted a sentence there that wasn\u2019t business.\u201d\n\nJune wanted to hold Sana\u2019s wrist and put her forehead against the vine and breathe the ink in like a medicine. She settled for a nod that carried the weight of a bucket. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and then, because this was the story they were in, her phone buzzed with a message taken from a script. It was a Board\u2019s condolence, which is a genre that has learned to be precise, to offer a horizon, to speak of grief as an efficient investment. She deleted it without opening it and the deletion made a smaller sound inside her than she wanted.\n\nIn the lab, Dr. Yi adjusted the sim\u2019s parameters and told her in an ordinary voice the news had made his wife cancel their subscription to the Board\u2019s daily dispatch. He said it like a personal rebellion because it was. June flew the model through teeth that were not exactly there. She did not vomit. When she took the headset off, Bram was a chair away with his elbows on his knees and eyes like obsidian. \u201cSkiant pushed an update to the ark logistic scheduler overnight,\u201d he said, which is friendship-speak for hello. \u201cIt makes the second wave one month earlier if the first wave is missing a tenth of its planned human weights. They call people weights, which I appreciate for its honesty and hate for the same reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re building a room where they will congratulate themselves for saving fuel,\u201d June said, and her voice tried for lightness and failed. \u201cI need you to build me a second voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to define second voice in a way that doesn\u2019t get me arrested just for repeating it,\u201d he said, but he was already sitting down like a person who had agreed before he knew the terms. \u201cAre we talking about faking an individuation pattern, like persuading a door that a person is in the room by singing in a register that looks like that person\u2019s chatter. Are we talking majority sound. Are we talking a choir.\u201d\n\nShe felt something unclench by a degree because this was the part she knew how to do: turn need into protocol. \u201cA choir,\u201d she said, and the word tasted like church even though she had never believed in any God but sentence structure. \u201cThe door listens for a pair it defines as relational. It doesn\u2019t require biology and can be satisfied by a legal pair. It also listens for an oversight voice\u2014a public. We will convene a public under Section VI and carry that into the chord. We need a way to take a live, not recorded, not forged, voice of a crowd and translate it into an input the door respects. It cannot look like a hack because it isn\u2019t. It has to be noisy and true.\u201d\n\nBram scrubbed his hands over his face like he could wake a different version of himself who had more time for ethical catastrophes. \u201cWe can build a lattice of devices. Ten thousand phones saying yes is hard to fake if the yeses are entangled to their owners in ways that matter. We can ask for consent in a way that is not a trick. We can piggyback on the Board\u2019s own attendance trackers and give their math a panic attack by making consent a contagion. We will need the old man in the scarf. We will need a pastor who swears. We will need money, which I do not have. We will need the riders, which I can get. We will need a time more than an algorithm wants to give us.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo nights,\u201d she said, because the letter had written a time on the inside of her head with a pen she could not uncap or throw away. \u201cAt dusk under the cables where the river still remembers it was a river and not an asset. It is a place where sound doesn\u2019t become content until later.\u201d\n\nHe nodded like she had asked him for coffee. \u201cI will scare a budget out of a grant that was written for bird migration,\u201d he said. \u201cBirds migrate, voices migrate. It\u2019s all the same to a line item as long as the receipts know how to lie. Sana can scare a judge out of a scarf. I can scare Skiant enough to make them send a handler, which we will then put to use because nothing legitimizes a human thing like a robot being scared of it.\u201d\n\nJune felt the woman in the blue felt hat like a shadow that respected the sun. The woman was in the quad, pretending to look at a bronze statue of a man on a horse who had never ridden one. The woman held a tablet like a prayer book. The woman smiled when June passed as if they were still performing the same show. June ignored her, which is a form of speech. She went home in a route that changed at every corner. She found her aunt on her screen with hair like a nest and a story about oranges that wandered and then returned to the river and ended with a sentence that made no sense as a plan and made all the sense as a blessing. Her aunt said, \u201cYou count days by the honest means you have,\u201d and June felt full of numbers suddenly that were not about fuel.\n\nThe apartment had the feeling of a body that has lost a soul and is trying not to alarm the others. The brush lay where Wren had left it and the window was open slightly as if to let out something that would make the room rot if it stayed. June closed it because she could not bear being cast as the version of herself who let a window stand open forever. She picked up the chisel and she put it down. She took the metal that was not a key and held it until its cold became temperature. She put it under her shirt and let it lie against her skin, which is a primitive technology for remembering you are an animal.\n\nThe message from Professor Salvatore came as a list that pretended to be an invitation. He had found a judge who ran fast. He had found a nurse who could speak without crying and make other people cry responsibly. He had found a union. He had found a park with a maintenance schedule that left its lights on by accident every other hour. He had found a sound system that used to belong to a band that was famous for a year in the time between wars. He had found a pastor who called God a committee and didn\u2019t get fired because the committee liked his jokes.\n\nSana sent the route for delivery riders and added at the end, in parentheses, a set of instructions that read like superstition and were in fact craft: do not go in clumps larger than seven because that looks like a parade and they will put up metal. do not carry signs until you see the judge. do not say the word until the microphone catches it.\n\nBram sent a diagram of a mesh that looked like lace. It was a method of making voices together. It was a topology that would make it hard and not impossible to interrupt. It was a chorus that would be born, be heard, and go away without leaving its body parts behind for the Board to study. He wrote: we will need to trust strangers. He wrote: I hate trusting strangers and I am trying to get better. He wrote: if we pull this off I will never again make fun of your habit of writing in pencil on napkins.\n\nJune folded under the shower\u2019s heat and cried the way water cries, all at once and indiscriminate. The next day she went, because the plan required it, to the tour Bram had called stupid in public and secretly worshiped in private. The Asterism\u2019s engine cathedral was not the kind of place a human could visit and remain intact. The structure made its own weather. The nested rings hummed in registers that made her molars tune. A Board handler with hair like a polished plane walked backward in front of them telling the story of how a million parts had been persuaded to stop being a pile and become a song. June carried the not-key tucked into the waist of her pants and remembered her father tossing the chisel to her and saying, hands.\n\nThe handler\u2019s voice had the exact amount of casual the Board had learned to add to technical doom to make it palatable. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d he said, because they had learned to say simple when what they meant was inexorable. \u201cYou build redundancy until redundancy becomes character. You measure everything. You choose the lightest viable option every time. You architect risk so it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo the doors talk,\u201d June asked, and there was polite laughter because people like her were the reason tours were difficult.\n\n\u201cThey talk to those they need to,\u201d he said, and he smiled like a coin. \u201cThey are governed. That\u2019s what governance is. Knowing which inputs you accept and making sure the ones you don\u2019t have a place to go scream.\u201d\n\nBram\u2019s friend, a woman with wrists like piano and a security badge that might have been borrowed or stolen or conjured, hung back with them as the group moved ahead to the viewing platform where people took the exact picture that would make their mothers proud. \u201cWho are you,\u201d she asked June, because some people do not have time to pretend they don\u2019t recognize a pulse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nobody important,\u201d June said, and she knew how unconvincing she sounded.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the reason my boss slept three hours last night,\u201d the woman said, and she sounded both annoyed and grateful, which is how people in service to machines sound when humans do something unpredictable. \u201cWe have monitors listening for patterns and the pattern we\u2019re hearing is that humans have decided they want one ship and not one ship plus one Board. If you bring a crowd, come hungry because the Ark has an appetite for histories. Don\u2019t talk about rights. Talk about obligations. The door likes words with dirt on them.\u201d\n\nJune wanted to laugh and instead put a hand on the rail and felt the metal vibrate with the music of a thing that had not yet left and was already in space. She could see the seam where the giant ring held its latches closed, not a seam really, more a suggestion of a time when the machine will change shapes. Her mouth tasted copper. Her legs went gently cotton. She thought she might fall forward in the direction of the hum and be taken by it the way gulls are sometimes taken by wind. Bram\u2019s hand on her elbow was a practical theology.\n\nAfter the tour, her phone had three missed calls from a number that resolved to Nothing and a message from the woman in the blue felt hat that said, simply, let\u2019s talk. Wren would have replied with a public grace and a private file of inconvenience. June turned the phone face down on a table and sat in the corner with a vending machine coffee that pretended to be coffee and read, carefully, the line in Section VI that said: this action must be contemporaneously witnessed by the existing institutions of the public. It meant nothing if you did it alone. It meant everything if you did it with enough bodies to become a fact.\n\nThe night of the convening rose out of the afternoon like a tide that had been on the schedule forever and still caught the shoreline off guard. The cables sang because the wind made them sing, and the people below countered with their own song, phones in the air like fireflies. Sana\u2019s funeral poet stood on a milk crate and read a line that made the concrete look like a cathedral. The nurse spoke. The judge unveiled his face like a secular sacrament. The riders circled like planets finding a stable orbit. The union brought a banner that had more patches than original cloth, a quilt that remembered every season of weather. Dr. Yi stood at the back with his hands jammed into his pockets and looked like a person who had finally accepted that science was one branch on a tree.\n\nBram\u2019s mesh went live and he looked for a second like he was going to throw up and then like he had never loved anything this much that wasn\u2019t a human. Professor Salvatore opened a small case that looked like it had once held a flute and took out a microphone wrapped in an old scarf. He nodded at June and the nod was a handing over of something that did not fit into hands. She stood on something that made her taller and the air did the thing it does when it learns what it\u2019s for. She said, \u201cWe are here in the name of a law written by people who had wet socks,\u201d and the crowd laughed and the judge smiled because he knew that sentence could be read into a record. She said, \u201cWe are attesting to a hazard in plain view. We are naming the Ark as critical to our survival and thus not the property of any entity who can be sold.\u201d She thought of Wren\u2019s mouth forming the word yes and the word no under a sky that had not been asked its opinion. She said, \u201cWe are appointing oversight because oversight went missing. We are naming a proxy because a person went missing and the door likes to pretend it cannot hear absence. We are making a human sound.\u201d\n\nWhen she held up the metal, the crowd did something very old in a very new way and it bent around her like a bowl. Bram raised his hand and on the screens around the periphery a map lit up with points that looked like stars and were people\u2019s consent, their phones singing that they consented to be part of this act. In the recording of that night that would be played at trials and in classrooms and in rooms where men in suits talked like pipeline valves, the sound that mattered was not her voice. It was the sound of the answer happening all at once, a thousand yeses sounded at the same time, not waiting their turn because they had waited ten years for that.\n\nLater, there would be arguments about whether the Ark heard them. There would be files with names like Causality. There would be math. In the moment, all June knew was that the metal in her hand warmed as if an animal had decided she was a safe bed. The small seam along its middle softened the way an eyelid does when a person is too tired to stay awake. She did not say Wren\u2019s name because the law did not need it and because the sound would have undone her and because the cameras were greedy for tears. She said the line in the mandate that needed saying and the judge said the lines he knew how to say from a thousand weddings and two hundred divorces and one flood. He said: so attested. He said: so carried.\n\nThe woman in the blue felt hat stood at the back like a storm watching a weather report. Her hands were folded in front of her like a psalm, and June felt in her a hatred that respected the work and a job that could not leave it. When the sound died down, the woman vanished the way rain does when the wind changes. The riders took the long way home. The pastor lit a candle and then blew it out and said that was not his job and laughed. The nurse hugged Sana in a way that said nurses manufacture the hormone that makes people able to go home and sleep.\n\nJune walked to the river and bent to rinse her hands because they felt sticky with oranges. Bram stood beside her like a tree that had decided not to fall. \u201cWe built a chord out of strangers,\u201d he said, and the bad poet in him was loose because he was relieved they had not been arrested mid-sentence. \u201cDo you think it will listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt listened,\u201d she said, and she didn\u2019t mean the ship only. She meant the world as a machine that sometimes accepted a human input and carried it forward with a minimum of mutilation. She meant the law as a radio. She meant a door that had a seam that had softened for a fraction of a degree under her fingers and then gone cool again like a friend who had to pretend he didn\u2019t know her when his boss walked past. She meant the fact that for an hour the city had been arranged by something other than money.\n\nThe first lights of the morning were bruised because dawn is often embarrassed by its own optimism. June went home and slept like a person who had left something terrible at the river, which is to say, she slept in pieces. In the morning, the headlines did what headlines do and chose the words that could be filed without a heart. The Board\u2019s spokespeople said the word illegal four ways and then softened it with the word moving. The Chair winked in the direction of the camera and used phrases that had been alpha-tested in a room with glass walls. The stock tickers flinched and then pretended not to have ever flinched.\n\nProfessor Salvatore sent a single sentence that had no emojis and did not need any: you were seen. Dr. Yi sent her a photograph someone had taken from behind her as she held the metal up under the cables and the river in the background did exactly what rivers do. Sana sent her a link to a page where riders could sign up for court support shifts and a link to a page where you could ask for soup if you had screamed too long and lost your voice. The judge sent a note through a friend with a single word written in impossible old ink: upheld.\n\nThe message that made her want to lie down on the floor arrived in a plain envelope with an eagle that did not surf the future. It was from an office that had not existed in any public directory last week. It said: Notice of Interim Appointment, Asterism Oversight Commission, pursuant to Continuity Compact, Section VI. It said her name the way her mother used to when she meant for June to stop and look. It said: kinship proxy accepted. It said: present yourself at Gate South when summoned. It said: your presence will be contested. It said: carry your counsel and your courage.\n\nThere was a card inside with a seal she had touched already, the feel of wax under her thumb making a new groove in a habit that would come to define her. There was a line at the bottom written in a hand that she recognized not because she had seen it before, but because it had her bones in it. It said: bring the coin. Underneath, a signature she couldn\u2019t stop seeing no matter where she looked, a name she had not thought to write next to President and yet there it was, lettered like a dare that someone had already accepted.Chapter 6\n\nThe envelope lay on the kitchen table the way a small animal might lie down after crossing a road\u2014still breathing, still itself, but somehow altered by the passage. June held it in two hands because there are letters you learn not to touch with one, and slid out the card with its formal bruise of a seal and the line that said bring the coin. The coin itself waited in the bowl where keys pretended not to be the things that make rooms mean something. She lifted it and felt the worn edge catch on the callus at the base of her thumb. The woman\u2019s face was not a face she could place from a textbook; the profile had cheekbones like a scaffolding and a mouth that did not smile and a brow that had learned to argue with weather. Around her, a ring of words in Latin and English spoke in an accent of civic fever. The deeper half of June\u2019s mind, the one that liked to notice how objects remember touch, thought about how many pockets this coin had warmed and how many people had pressed it into a palm to say, you are expected.\n\nShe put on the jacket that made her feel like her shoulders were borrowed from a kinder animal. The morning made its low industrial sound under the window, buses sighing and drone-birds pivoting on their false wrists. On the hall table, her father\u2019s chisel gleamed like something that had its own idea of time. She brushed the teeth of the blade with a fingertip, the way a person who grew up around tools learns to do, checking for burrs as if the metal were a tongue. The letter announcing the appointment lay beneath the coin wrapper like a second floor. Ms. Ibarra, Interim. The word interim was a bridge word; it held and it threatened to break. She slid the coin into the inner pocket where the not-key lay beneath a thin layer of fabric, cold to cold. The two metal shapes found each other with a tiny sound the air pretended not to notice.\n\nCounsel would be necessary, which was a phrase that made law sound like weather and weather sound like God. Professor Salvatore\u2019s message contained three names, each with a different flavor of courage. June chose the one whose file was mostly rumors and photographs of people in winter jackets standing at the edge of places that wanted to eat them. Maritza Korr was older than the keyboards she still used and younger than the roads that led to her office above a bodega that had sold oranges during the blackout because the owner had decided light was a duty, not a luxury. In person, Korr wore a scarf like a banner and had a set of rings that clicked when she set her hand down on a table, ceremonial and useful.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been appointed to a commission that was not supposed to be used for ships,\u201d Korr said, flipping the appointment over and back as if it might give up a secret on its other side. \u201cGood. That\u2019s what tools are for. Tell me what you can tell me and bite your tongue around the rest. I will build you a cage comfortable enough to move in.\u201d\n\nJune told her about the Mandate, about the judge who ran with his face in scarves, about the nurse who spoke like a ledger that had learned to sing. She said as little as she could about the not-key and said nothing about the river at night because there are parts of the story that do not help in any room where the ceiling is a set number of feet. Korr nodded like a person counting steps on a staircase she had climbed before. \u201cThey will contest jurisdiction,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will say continuity applies to bridges and dams, not to property that orbits. We will counter with the language of hazard and the public\u2019s interest. They will say you are unqualified. We will say you have breath. They will say this is theater. We will point to the flood and the fact that people are not a metaphor.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I bring the coin,\u201d June asked, and then realized the question had already been answered by the card in her pocket and by the muscle of her hand holding the coin even when she slept.\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Korr said. \u201cThese tokens were minted when the Compact needed a face. They gave them to the people they thought might have to speak in rooms without heat. They make scanners fidget. They make executives remember their grandmothers.\u201d\n\nAt Gate South, the concrete had the skin of something that had been poured by people who thought about the future as a state of matter. The security hut was a small glass aquarium where a man and a woman swam in rules. The woman in the blue felt hat stood to the side as if she had been there all night, not waiting for anyone in particular and somehow waiting for June, hands folded in front of her like someone holding a small prayer that had learned to be quiet. The hat had a dent in the brim; it was the kind of felt that did not come from a cheap store and also did not come from an expensive one. It came from a department in the Board called soft power.\n\n\u201cMs. Ibarra,\u201d the woman said in a voice that belonged in a hallway, not a stage. \u201cThe Liaison Office is available to you as a resource. These proceedings are irregular and the Ark is a complex asset. We all want\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAir,\u201d June said, and watched the line of the woman\u2019s mouth soften and harden in the same second.\n\n\u201cContinuity,\u201d the woman said instead, letting the correction sit between them like a pot on a trivet. \u201cMay I walk with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already are,\u201d June said, which was true, and moved toward the scanner with the feeling you get when deep water is near and you are very aware of your bones. She placed the envelope on the bar that knew how to read paper in an age allergic to it. She set the coin on the little shelf where cufflinks went and wedding rings sometimes sat while their owners pretended not to be naked without them. The machine woke up with a noise that was not in its manual. The light that had been assigned to mean \u201cokay\u201d blinked in the diseased green that meant \u201cwhat,\u201d and then gave up the argument and turned a steady, embarrassed blue. The guard\u2019s eyebrows rose in a choreography that meant he had not seen this particular page of the play.\n\n\u201cContinuity token,\u201d the man said to the woman, which was the kind of language you didn\u2019t hear unless you had learned the old words or attended funerals for institutions. \u201cProceed.\u201d\n\nThe hallway that led to the commission room had the particular smell of air that has been told to scrub itself for a very long time. Inside, the chairs were more honest than the ones in the corporate lobbies; they creaked when people sat, which is how you know someone has a body. June recognized the nurse from the convening by the way she held her bag like a child who did not want to be domesticated. The riders\u2019 union had sent not a man with a bullhorn but a woman with an extra helmet she kept offering to anyone who looked like they might need protection. The judge had shaved badly and looked younger for the error. Professor Salvatore sat two rows back with his hands on his knees, as if ready to rise or to hold himself down.\n\nAcross the aisle, the Board had arranged its counsel into stacks of voices, each with a different color of suit and a different school of hair. At their center, a man whose smile had learned to be meaningful in ten percent of pictures and invisible in the rest nodded at June like someone acknowledging a problem with the lighting. The woman with the blue felt hat sat behind him, attentive without being solicitous, the kind of presence that made cameras behave. Korr slipped in with papers like knives and a thermos that looked like a small torpedo. She squeezed June\u2019s shoulder with fingers that had left bruises on infrastructure.\n\nThe hearing televised itself because the Board believed in the generosity of cameras and the Compact believed in the danger of closed doors. Korr spoke in a tone that fit squarely in the register courts expect, all nouns and facts with verbs hammered flat. She made the case that the Asterism was critical infrastructure not because of its price or its ambition, but because of the lives it proposed to carry and the systems it would force to be born elsewhere. She rolled out the Mandate, the quorum, the signatures, the attestation by constituencies that had learned to pronounce their names in tear gas. The judge on the bench, different from the one with a scarf, looked like a woman who had taught high school for twenty years and then accepted a job that promised less chalk and more damage. She asked two questions: whether the Compact had ever been applied to something not attached to ground, and whether the coin meant anything other than sentiment. Korr answered the first with a flood photo and the second by asking June to place the coin on the table. The court\u2019s microphone picked up the small metallic sound of it meeting wood and the room listened, as if the noise carried data.\n\nThe Board\u2019s counsel rose and performed concern like a traditional dance. He spoke about precedent the way a surgeon speaks about scar tissue. He used the word dangerous and then replaced it with concerning and then said regrettably and then said opportunity as if it were a towel. He said the Ark\u2019s governance was a matter of contract, not community, and that the law had no socket into which this new plug could be safely inserted. He said a ship cannot be a bridge. He said grief cannot be a credential. He did not say Wren\u2019s name. June\u2019s throat ached as if she had shouted and had not. The judge listened as if she were emptying her hands one by one.\n\nWhen the thing was decided, it didn\u2019t happen with a gavel; it happened with a sentence that made all the phones light and all the people breathe at the same time. The judge said the Mandate was upheld in narrow scope, that the Continuity Compact could apply to the Asterism\u2019s oversight of functions that touched the public: life support ratios, emergency protocols, the conditions under which land would be carved up and names assigned. She said the Board\u2019s property claims would remain a separate fight. She said the ship would not leave this gravity without hearing the public\u2019s voice on matters of oxygen and habitation and the violent question of who counts. She said the coin was a token and also a tool. She said, \u201cProceed.\u201d\n\nIf there was triumph in the room it did not jump; it moved like an animal with a wound, careful not to open itself on the furniture. The Board\u2019s counsel smiled as if being narrowed was a posture he could live in. The woman in the felt hat tipped her head the way a person does when a pianist misses a note only the pianist can hear. Korr packed her knives and torpedo and murmured a list of next moves under her breath, names like O-rings in a bag. Salvatore touched June\u2019s shoulder in a gesture that was almost father and almost colleague and settled for the open territory of spectator with a stake. The riders\u2019 representative handed June the spare helmet without looking at her and said, \u201cWear this later. Not now. Later.\u201d\n\nThey took them by shuttle to the perimeter room under the ribs of the Ark where the ground knew it had to stop and the machine began to hum again, not intimately, not yet. The corridors here had weather; sections that were colder for reasons both thermal and cultural, pockets where the sound of your own shoes reminded you that you were not a soundproof species. The Board kept the tour routes to the left and the serious work to the right; a woman with a dry braid that said military and an ID that said hospitality pretended the directions were arbitrary. Bram caught up with them in a jacket that had never seen an iron and a badge that might or might not belong to him depending on who asked. He breathed like a person who had been running from a version of himself that believed in caution.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seeded the mesh with the choir nodes,\u201d he whispered in a voice that was not a whisper because nothing can hide from microphones that are trying. \u201cSound will travel. Consent will anchor it. The door won\u2019t be able to say it didn\u2019t hear. If they ask me how I know, I will say bird migration.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like a criminal,\u201d Korr said, not unkindly. \u201cWhen this is over you will want multivitamins.\u201d\n\nThey made them put their names on a screen, names becoming light, light becoming a file, a file becoming an argument. The woman in the felt hat stayed one body behind the Board\u2019s lead counsel and one ahead of the man from Hospitality, a wedge the perfect size to pry intention from outcome. June thought of Wren\u2019s eye pencil lying on the sink and of the line the pencil made when someone with a steady hand drew it. The not-key warmed; the coin pressed into her ribs like a tooth. The Asterism\u2019s flank spread out to the left, a vast blade with seams like whispers. June could feel the charge in the air the way you feel a storm that is not yet above you but has read your address. The access door that mattered to this moment looked nothing like a temple; it looked like a maintenance hatch with a nicer budget. It had quiet edges and a panel that did not advertise itself as a face and a series of lights that did not apologize for being small.\n\nThe Board\u2019s handler from the tour appeared like a conscience. \u201cOur concern is safety,\u201d he said, and gestured with an open palm in the direction of the door as if this were a long-standing friendship. \u201cThe core is hot in all the ways that word used to mean and then some. This verification will be performed with supervision, redundancies, and a timer. If your input is less than civil in either register\u2014polite or computational\u2014the system will stand you down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are here to audit, not to vandalize,\u201d Korr said, and June almost laughed because she had never seen a vandal carry a torpedo thermos.\n\n\u201cPut us where the door can hear,\u201d Professor Salvatore said, and the handler nodded as if he were used to people who had opinions about acoustics. He waved them into a shallow bay where the wall came forward slightly and the ceiling lowered like the inside of a throat. The room smelled like damp metal and the inside of new electronics. The riders\u2019 representative stood beside the nurse as if proximity could invent a rule. Bram checked the map on his device and looked at June with the expression of someone trying to say without saying: this is the only river we get.\n\nJune set the coin in the palm of her left hand. She didn\u2019t like the solstice feeling of it alone, so she placed the not-key beside it and felt the odd sensation of two different histories agreeing to be held. She had dreamed a door with a seam like a seed and here it was in a shape the eye could make sense of. It did not look at her because it had not been built to flatter human psychology. That was the Board\u2019s job and the Board did it well. The door listened by patterns. It listened to math. It listened to relationship. It would listen, June thought, to words if the words brought enough bodies with them.\n\nKorr handed her a small microphone that had bad manners in the nicest way. \u201cSpeak as you did under the cables,\u201d she said. \u201cAdd the necessary legal fiction and hold your breath.\u201d\n\nJune looked at the panel not because she liked the idea of addressing machinery but because she needed a surface to throw her words against. Her own voice sounded like a stranger for a second and then settled into the groove it had learned at the river. She said her name in the tense the law liked. She said the words kinship proxy with care. She named the Continuity Compact. She said the section number and it lifted in the air like a numeral, ridiculous and perfect. She said the content of the emergency and learned that emergencies taste different depending on the room. She named the constituencies who had attested and felt them brush against her like coats at a wake. She did not say Wren. She did not say sister. She did not say river. She said obligation. She said breath. She said this door has to make room for a public.\n\nBram lifted his hand when it was his turn without moving his feet because sometimes movement is the one thing you can\u2019t afford. He sent the mesh live. Screens that had been pretending to sleep along the wall woke enough to show a map of the city\u2019s attention, points of light which were people saying yes, I consent to be part of this sound, yes, I will lend my voice to a chord that will not be recorded for advertisements later. The handler\u2019s mouth pulled left the way it does when someone steps into a law they don\u2019t understand and asks for a receipt. The woman in the blue felt hat lowered her eyes briefly as if to admire her shoes and June wondered what it would be like to live a life in which you could acknowledge your own fear in a room by looking at your shoes and then keep your job.\n\nWhen the door answered, it did not do so in a way any civics class would recognize. A light near the seam shifted from pretend-calm to actual-listening. The panel whispered in a tone that ached between audible and not. The not-key in June\u2019s hand warmed and the seam felt less like a line that divided and more like a line that would, if pressed, make of two pieces a hinge. She set the coin on the small shelf under the panel because she could not stand having both objects in her hands for the task. The coin nested there like it had known it would someday find a home again on a machine.\n\n\u201cProximity established,\u201d a voice said from the ceiling, not human and not unkind. It was a voice that had learned not to apologize in public.\n\nThe Board\u2019s counsel cleared his throat, which is a move men practice. \u201cA reminder that any change in status must be recorded as provisional pending further litigation,\u201d he said, to the air and to the reporters in his head.\n\n\u201cCo-presence required,\u201d the door said, with the indifference of a weather report. \u201cRelational chord incomplete.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe anticipated that,\u201d Korr said, and tipped her head toward the judge in their party, the scarfed runner who had become a clause. He stepped forward and held out his own token, a chip of metal embossed with county and oath. It was a silly little thing that had put men in prison and women into rooms where they named their dead. He set it beside the coin and the machine that was not supposed to be impressed by ceremony took it in like a vitamin. Bram\u2019s map showed a swell of light as the choir realized they were required and obliged and sang in their way, phones registering the moment with a fidelity that felt like an honest debt.\n\nThe panel emitted a sound like a bird remembering an old song badly and then improving with every note. June lifted the not-key and did not insert it because the law said no one could until roles were stabilized. She simply brought it near the seam. The metal in her hand began to tick in a tempo that matched her pulse and then deliberately fell out of step, testing whether it led or followed. For a second, all the systems in the room breathed at the same time. The door undid something small\u2014not an opening you could walk through, not a surrender, but a shrug of a latch, the turning over of a heavy sleeper in a bed. June\u2019s knees almost buckled and she put her hand flat on the wall to remind her body what its shape was.\n\n\u201cRecognition\u2014audio. Recognition\u2014attestation. Recognition\u2014paired-proxy pending,\u201d the voice said, each word like a stone tossed not at their feet but near enough to see the splash.\n\nThe Board\u2019s handler raised a palm. \u201cThat\u2019s sufficient for today,\u201d he said, which was the kind of sentence that believed the calendar belonged to him. \u201cWe have confirmed the door can hear this\u2026 augmented community input. We will schedule a controlled session for further testing.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurther testing is called governance,\u201d Korr said, too soft for the transcript, and June had to bite her lip to keep her face from behaving like a mouthpiece for satisfaction. The judge murmured something about affidavits. The nurse took a breath like a person who had been underwater for three minutes and done it not as a trick but as a lifestyle. The riders\u2019 representative squeezed June\u2019s arm hard enough to leave information.\n\nThe woman in the felt hat moved close enough that June could see the small stitches in the felt where a moth had once nearly won. \u201cYou need to know two things,\u201d she said quietly, not asking for ownership of any moment and still getting a bite. \u201cOne: we will offer you help that will look clean and will come in a pale envelope. Two: there are rooms where the doors do not listen to coins, only to numbers. Bring people who count that way. Bring them early.\u201d\n\nJune wanted to ask her who taught her to love a ship with one hand and distrust it with the other. She wanted to ask her what it felt like to get dressed each day in a job that refused to admit it had a moral. She said instead, \u201cThere is a third thing,\u201d and waited until the woman looked at her with the respect of expecting a sentence not filled with heat. \u201cThe law is not a photograph. It will not hold still for your cameras.\u201d\n\nIt was not a good line and it was not a bad one. It was a rope June could put her hand on when the hallway pitched. Out in the parking lot, Bram\u2019s legs did the loose thing they did when his brain had been sprinting for hours; he sat on a parking bumper and laughed without making a sound for a full half minute. When he got his lungs back he said, \u201cWe got the door to trust a ghost,\u201d and the sentence blew June sideways like a gust.\n\n\u201cWe made a family out of a Compact and a crowd,\u201d she said, because it mattered that this not be a miracle. It had to be a technique.\n\nBack at the apartment, the air had decided to stop pretending it wasn\u2019t winter. June took the coin from her pocket and set it on the dresser where Wren\u2019s brush lay like a relic. The coin wobbled in the small divot in the wood that their father had told them was a flaw in the tree and in the hands that worked it. She touched the brush and thought about the hundreds of mornings that had been made by that moved pigment, the choices you make when you look in a mirror and allow yourself to be looked at by yourself. The not-key went under the pillow again because that was where it slept when not being asked to be a sheaf of futures.\n\nThe letter on the table had three new pages she swore had not been there when she left. She did not read them because her body remembered the feeling after the last time, the way receiving instruction had stained the day that followed with the sense that she had not properly resisted. She held the paper to her nose and breathed in lemon and heat and the faintest tang of something like iron. She slid the pages back under the older text like a person slipping an eccentric aunt under a table to stop her from tapping her spoon. She made tea. She watched the street. She heard a siren that did not belong to police or to ambulances. It belonged to a factory that had been turned into apartments and kept the siren for the romance of its past.\n\nMessages came the way geese do\u2014one too early, three at once, then a lull that made you think maybe the season had turned. Dr. Yi wrote to say that the sim team had been given an unscheduled block on the big rig and did she want to hold the stick for the storm run named after a tooth. Sana wrote to say the riders had gone home without arrests but two had lost phones to the kind of police who only like devices when they are someone else\u2019s alibi, and could the commission fund replacements without filing it through a rubric that would make the riders into homework. The judge with the scarves sent a picture of his dog, which was the way some men apologize for the parts of themselves that cannot be shared. Professor Salvatore sent a list of names of old union leaders and one of them had the last name Ibarra and June stared at it until the letters became rivers and then looked away.\n\nNear dusk, the elevator in her building sighed in a way that promised a visitor and produced one. The woman in the blue felt hat did not come in; she stood in the doorway the way she must have taught herself not to and not to do. Behind her, a young man in a jacket that cost as much as a month\u2019s rent held a white envelope like a tray.\n\n\u201cThis is the pale envelope,\u201d the woman said without apology. \u201cA Board subcommittee tasked with making you easier to love would like to offer you a budget and an office that does not smell like rain. They would like to give you staff with long r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and the kind of snacks that make people forgive things. They would like to cap your public activity in exchange for access. They would like to call this partnership.\u201d She tilted her head as if listening to a faint radio station in the walls. \u201cI believe you are not going to take this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy bring it,\u201d June asked, and watched the whisker-fine muscles around the woman\u2019s mouth choose an answer.\n\n\u201cBecause I believe in minutes,\u201d the woman said. \u201cSometimes it is useful to hold a minute where the other side thinks you are tempted.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d June said, because she did not want to pretend virtue she didn\u2019t possess. \u201cI would like snacks and bodies that can do the work without falling down.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it works,\u201d the woman said, and let herself smile. \u201cDon\u2019t sign. It hands them your minutes.\u201d\n\nJune took the envelope because that\u2019s what you do when the ritual arrives. You do not slam a door on a sacrament; you place it on a table and you let it be a center of gravity and you bring your hands up empty. When the door closed, she held the envelope up to the light and saw the outlines of an office, a stipend, the kind of language that had learned to drop bullets like confetti. She slid the thing under a stack of grocery receipts and mailers for dental plans and felt an ordinary fury lift from her stomach to her throat and then settle in the hinge of her jaw.\n\nShe walked to the river without telling anybody or telling herself it was stupid not to tell anybody. The water wasn\u2019t a metaphor and it was. Along the railing, someone had tied a ribbon around the spot where the night had come apart. June put her hand flat on the cold metal and felt the strange mammalian comfort of touch. \u201cI\u2019m going to carry you where you don\u2019t want to go,\u201d she said into the wind, and her words blew back into her own face and made her cheeks hurt. \u201cYou can hate me later.\u201d\n\nAt home, the apartment sounded like the inside of a shell\u2014the hum of electricity, the high whine of the refrigerator\u2019s self-regard, the neighbor\u2019s footfall above her as regular as an apology. She poured soup out of a carton and watched the slow physics of it filling the bowl. In the darkness of her phone, an alert brightened that did not belong to any app she had installed. It said: Summons\u2014Gate South, Proximity Test II. It said: bring coin, counsel, choir. It said: schedule accelerated due to externalities. It said: weather window closing. It said: forty-eight hours.\n\nJune lay down on the rug with her feet on the couch because that is the position some bodies need to remember they are not a catalog of tasks. She pictured the door, the seam, the panel, the wakened light like an animal opening one eye in the morning to see if the room is the same as the room it fell asleep in. She thought of the coin\u2019s edge under her thumb and the feeling of the not-key ticking against her pulse. She thought of Wren\u2019s mouth putting itself together around a sentence she didn\u2019t get to finish. She thought of Dr. Yi\u2019s weather spin and the way nine minutes could be visible on a body like a bruise days later. She closed her eyes and counted forward to ten and back to zero until the numbers loosened their belts and stopped telling time.\n\nShe dreamed that the Ark called her by the wrong name. She dreamed that the door opened and her father walked out with paint on his hands and said he had found a better color for the kitchen. She dreamed a field of chairs holding a referendum on sitting. She woke to the sound of someone singing outside in a voice that believed itself and did not care who else did. In the gray light, her phone shone with Bram\u2019s name and a message that said: we need to borrow the stadium because the choir needs room, and also because the Board hates images of crowds that don\u2019t belong to them. She wrote back: talk to the band with the old sound system. Talk to the pastor who thinks God is a committee. Ask Sana to ask the nurses to bring the shade tents that don\u2019t require permits.\n\nOn campus, the stairwell smelled like chlorine and fruit rinds. Dr. Yi had circles under his eyes whose color names she didn\u2019t have, and his hair had chosen a side in a fight. \u201cStorm run at sixteen hundred,\u201d he said, and handed her a printout because his eyes needed the comfort of paper as much as his mouth needed the lie that this was an ordinary day. \u201cIf the Commission lets you off your leash.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Commission is a leash,\u201d she said, and he smiled with a pain that had been cultivated over a lifetime into something useful.\n\nSana rolled up like a tide with two riders in tow and a woman June didn\u2019t know whose headscarf had constellations. \u201cWe brought the kind of people they count,\u201d Sana said. \u201cData architects who don\u2019t like their own fountains and a grandmother whose phone has been ritualized by seven grandchildren. When we say yes, it will sound like rent.\u201d\n\nProfessor Salvatore had the look men get when they fill their pockets with pellets before a long walk and decide not to count them. \u201cThere\u2019s a rule in old parliamentary procedure that if you don\u2019t have the votes you elongate time,\u201d he said, no hello because he was not that kind of man today. \u201cThe Board will try to make the weather window a rope they can pull through their hands. We will stub our toe on their calendar and make them curse.\u201d\n\nThey took over the stadium with a permission no one had written because the gate guard sang in the pastor\u2019s choir and the band\u2019s old sound system had a coat of stickers that marked it as a veteran. Bram and his crew installed devices that looked like benign dandelions in the concrete seams and carefully did not call them anything. The nurses set up water tables and shade so people could be a public without collapsing. The judge with the scarf stood in a doorway as if he had spent a long life in doorways waiting to be asked to count a quorum. Korr briefed volunteers like a general who understands that the front is a moving target. The woman in the felt hat came and stood high in the bleachers like a seagull and pretended to check her messages for an hour and did nothing that indicated she had ever eaten a crust.\n\nJune watched the chairs fill with bodies and thought about how law is made out of breath and stamina and the willingness to stand in the same square foot for an hour. When she spoke into the microphone that sounded worse than the room, she said less than she wanted to and more than the Board liked. She told the people to say yes and mean it and not to sing if they didn\u2019t consent. She told them the door likes obligations. She told them to think of the Ark as a bad-tempered ancestor who knew more than you and would do worse if unsupervised. They laughed in the way people do when you ask them to perform a new emotion in public and they try it on and find that it fits around the shoulders.\n\nThe second proximity test had the cadence of a wedding you crash because the groom owes you money. The door had been expecting them; the lights woke with the efficiency of a host who has already put the bottles in ice. The handler\u2019s smile was smaller. The Board\u2019s counsel had brought a different tie. The woman in the blue felt hat had a hard line at the corner of her mouth that made June think about good boots. The judge with the scarf took off his scarf and folded it, setting it on the rail like a placenta. Korr\u2019s rings clicked. Bram\u2019s map pulsed.\n\n\u201cRelational chord required,\u201d the door said, before anyone had even begun to rehearse politeness. \u201cProximity of oversight affirmed. Co-presence confirmation pending. Present kinship proof.\u201d\n\nJune placed the coin. The judge placed his chip because ritual is a first language. Korr read the clause aloud because the law likes to be invited to its own party. June took the not-key out of her pocket and let the metal touch the seam in the way you touch a sleeping child to wake them without making them afraid. The mesh flared. The stadium breathed into its own microphones and the sound reached the Ark by the conduit Bram had built out of consent and indignation. A thousand yeses sounded, not in chorus like a hymn performed for quality, but as a wave a shore recognizes.\n\nThis time the door opened something large enough to put a hand through. The seam became a lid. The hinge remembered itself. The panel slid a fraction in. Cold air exhaled from the space beyond with a smell like storms and new wiring. The handler made a sound that would not go on the record. The Board\u2019s counsel moved forward and stopped himself by polishing his ring against his paper. The woman in the felt hat closed her eyes, and the movement was so small that if you had not been watching her for days you would have missed it; June saw it and understood she was watching someone whose job it was to hate hope guard against a moment of oxygen.\n\n\u201cRecognition\u2014proxy accepted,\u201d the voice said. \u201cLimiting function applied. Scope: life support, emergency protocol, human allocation veto, habitat expansion freeze pending review. Clock initiated. Thirty-six hours.\u201d\n\nKorr hissed the way a mother cat does when a hawk\u2019s shadow crosses a yard. \u201cThey have given us a frame,\u201d she said, and then corrected herself as a professional does when lying even in private does harm. \u201cWe have taken a frame. It will shrink if we do not fill it immediately.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the seam, the Ark hummed the song of its own weather. June stepped forward until the handler\u2019s hand and Korr\u2019s hand and law itself rested on her shoulder, not to stop her and not to let her go alone but to make the movement one the story could afford. Inside, the architecture of the core looked like someone had taught physics to weave. The rings layered in on themselves like promises kept after the fact. The throbbing lights did not pulse for her; they pulsed because that is what they do. She felt gripped by a love so uglily named you can\u2019t say it at a microphone without being mistaken for a person who has chosen the wrong room.\n\nShe turned back because this was not the chapter where she walked ahead. Bram\u2019s eyes were wet with the exact amount a body allows before deciding to call the event weather. Korr wrote with a pen that had its own weight. The judge spoke and made his words into hooks. The riders\u2019 representative checked her watch and started calling kitchens, because if people were going to stand for the next day and a half they would need soup. Sana took a video of nothing in particular and sent it to a list that sunburned the Board\u2019s public relations feed. The woman in the felt hat texted someone and then put her phone in her pocket and stood with her hands empty for a full minute as if she were making a choice about what she could hold.\n\nThey poured themselves out into the afternoon and it felt, surprisingly, like coming back from a swim into air that forgives you. The stadium kept breathing behind them. The city leaned in with its thousand mouths and demanded updates translated into images. June walked with Bram down a flight of concrete stairs that smelled like spilled beer and wind and told him about the taste in her mouth that reminded her of oranges and blood. He told her about a line of code that had decided to be interesting at two in the morning and how he had told it to go back to sleep. They laughed in a way that didn\u2019t sound like laughter because laughter is what your body makes when it thinks it will be allowed to live.\n\nOn her door waited another envelope with the old eagle, this one small as a palm and heavy as a hope. Inside, a card with six sentences and the kind of handwriting old presidents pretend to have time for. It said: you have thirty-six hours to make a dent so lasting even the ship\u2019s math will have to note it. It said: do not waste a minute pretending to be clean. It said: the door likes obligations that rhyme, so align oxygen with equity and see if the machine blushes. It said: call the river into the room with you by carrying its mud on your shoes. It said: you will be accused of madness. It said: good.\n\nShe set the card down beside the coin and the brush and the chisel. She washed her hands and watched the water go opaque where it met the oil from the blade. She sat at the table and made a list in pencil, because pencil allows for wrong. She wrote: oxygen ratios\u2014public allocation model; safety protocols\u2014human veto triggers; habitat expansion\u2014freeze enforcement; selection metric\u2014de-bias, public oversight; land rights\u2014moratorium language; labor\u2014union compacts embedded; emergency\u2014who counts as saved. She drew a box around the line labeled oxygen and wrote beside it: obligations with dirt.\n\nAt midnight, Bram texted from a room that hummed with borrowed power, saying he had found a way to make the Ark\u2019s register echo the word veto in a tone the human ear would accept as serious. Sana sent a photograph of the grandmother with the ritualized phone asleep in a chair with a blanket on her lap, mouth open, dreams audible. Korr sent a list of words the Board would try to smuggle into their drafts: optimize, streamline, efficiency, sustainability. Beside each, she had written a counter-word: duty, care, effort, repair. Professor Salvatore sent a recording of himself reading out loud from the Compact\u2019s footnotes, a bedtime story about stubborn rivers. The woman in the felt hat did not send anything, which was a gift June recognized and decided to receive as such.\n\nShe slept because exhaustion is a tool you respect. She woke before the sun could pretend to be noble. She put on the jacket with the shoulders. She tucked the coin and the not-key where skin made them real. She set the chisel down in the place of honor and touched it not because she believed objects could bless but because the body likes to do the last thing twice when the next thing is difficult. She closed the window because Wren always left it open. She whispered a sentence to the room that had learned how to hold sentences. She went out into a city that had, overnight, hung new banners on its cranes, little cloths that said words like breath and neighbor, and into a morning that did the one thing it could be counted on to do: arrive.Chapter 9\n\nThe city woke mean and practical, the way a body wakes on the second day of an illness knowing which joints will complain and which chores can still be forced through. June stood at the window while the kettle learned its single trick and watched the cables by the river sag and rise with wind that pretended to be important. On the dresser the coin had settled into the wood\u2019s divot as if it had grown there, the not-key under the pillow warming to the temperature of a plan. Thirty-six hours had turned into eighteen and then into a block of time that her brain refused to measure because measurement made it small. She wrote in pencil because the graphite allowed room for cowardice and then converted it into courage. Oxygen first, she told herself, because breath is what propaganda uses when it wants to be forgiven later.\n\nKorr arrived like weather with a briefcase that had clearly fallen down stairs in its youth and learned not to apologize. She laid out paper like bandages and pointed with a ringed finger at the list June had made, nodding at some words and razoring others with the gentleness of a person who likes the people she has to wound. \u201cWe braid oxygen into equity by making allocation a function of care and contribution, not of status,\u201d she said, and her voice had the graveyard humor of a nurse. \u201cSleep cycles synced across roles, not ranks. Heat rations responsive to bodies in recovery. Work assignments that recognize a day spent fixing the water line equals a day not counted against your allotment for rest. They will call it soft. We will call it survival.\u201d\n\nBram unfolded himself from the doorway with the hungry look he got when the problem had stopped being abstract and started being a number he could put in an equation and then refuse. He smelled like borrowed coffee and tatty optimism. \u201cIf the Ark\u2019s register accepts new invariants at a governance layer, we can define commitments the scheduler must satisfy before optimizing anything else,\u201d he said, and his hands described a lattice in the air without his permission. \u201cWe make oxygen allocation a hard constraint tied to community labor hours and care metrics. We make care legible to math without torturing it into productivity. We\u2019re going to trick an optimizer into learning the word duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t trick it,\u201d June said, feeling how the words tasted in her mouth like promises you bite to check the coin. \u201cYou feed it examples until it gets religion.\u201d\n\nThey went to the stadium because bodies were still the unit of measure that made the Board nervous. The riders had set up a whiteboard the size of a good wall and Sana had written in block letters above it: HOW DO WE BREATHE TOGETHER. Nurses wrote down hours that were invisible in models and had to be made visible, like the time you spent walking a child around a room at three a.m. so he would not forget that air was for him, too. A cook who had never been invited into a room where governance was supposed to happen described grease traps and why their cleaning schedule affected morale, which affected accident rates, which would show up as oxygen spikes if the Ark bothered to measure joy. A waste tech whose hands had a permanent smell like honesty explained the fluid dynamics of pipes with a competence that made the Board\u2019s handler go very still and stop taking notes, because sometimes attention is a form of theft.\n\nJune listened with the hunger of a person who had been asked to build a law and remembered at the last minute that law is not stone, it is tissue. She wrote and wrote until the graphite made a smudge she would carry on her hand into every photo forever. When the blue felt hat appeared high up under the eaves, June felt the small click in her back that meant her body had noticed an old enemy in a new coat and did not much care whether the coat was kind. The woman stood with her hands in her pockets the way people do when they have given their fingers something to hold out of sight. When the stadium speakers squealed and settled, June looked up and gave the woman a brief chin, a hello you can deny in a deposition.\n\nAt Gate South the Ark crouched in its dry cradle like an animal that would pretend to be docile for as long as domes and paperwork were required. The handler had a mark on his cheek he had not had yesterday and a way of holding himself that suggested someone had shouted and he had not shouted back, which made him worse to talk to. He walked them through the parts they already knew as if repetition would make obedience and afterwards looked at Korr in the manner of a man who suspects he is standing next to a person who owns an older map. \u201cYou got your window,\u201d he said, staring past them into the hallway where the air did not know who it was yet. \u201cUse it without breaking anything we can\u2019t solder.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe intend to break only the things that were pretending to be unbreakable,\u201d Korr said, and lifted her torpedo thermos in a toast meant for exactly three human beings.\n\nThe panel in the verification bay had the awake look of a creature interrupted mid-molt. The seam was still a seam, the hinge a suggestion, the light a steady, unperformative steady. June could feel the mesh Bram had draped across the city thrumming like a net you keep your hand against so you know the sea hasn\u2019t chosen some other mood. She set the coin down with the formality that had built the courts in the first place. She refused to pretend she was not tallying every superstition. The judge placed his chip, the riders\u2019 representative leaned her helmet against the wall as if daring it to remember the impact of contact, the nurse stood with her knees slightly bent the way you do when you know the floor has layers.\n\n\u201cProximity and attestation confirmed,\u201d the not-voice said. \u201cScope open on presented domains. Provide invariants.\u201d\n\nBram looked at June the way he looked at puzzles and at people in pain. This is your part, his face said, and she swallowed the air that was available and stepped into the box their bodies made around the microphone. \u201cOxygen allocation obeys a rule that ties breath to responsibility, not to rank,\u201d she said, and she hated how summarized it sounded and was grateful to have language to make it into truth. \u201cCare work counts. Maintenance counts. Parenting counts. Small-body caretaking counts. Recovery counts. Community chores count. Meetings that take more than an hour without a decision count against your share,\u201d she added, the room allowing itself a grin and then letting it go. \u201cNo ration falls below a floor defined by bodies not by budgets. No vent opens wider because someone has better shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cInput requires quantification,\u201d the Ark said, and June stared at the panel and thought about how even in this it wanted her to demonstrate love by making a list. The nurses and the waste tech and the cooks started talking in measures, in minutes and liters and kJ per hour and heartbeats, and Bram caught their numbers and did not tame them, only translated them into what the register could swallow without spitting. Korr inserted a clause about audits that couldn\u2019t be faked without leaving a mark a child could see. The judge swore so softly it did not go on the record that audits would be human and would have chairs.\n\nThe door accepted the first invariant without ceremony and June felt something loosen at the base of her skull as if a bird had taken a breath there and decided to live. They moved quickly because hours are bones and bones need flesh. Emergency protocols came next: triggers that any human could pull that would freeze nonessential processes without having to petition a chair or a stack, a veto that required two bodies in agreement and a witness, and an after-action rule that said what had been frozen must justify itself to be thawed. The Ark did not like being told to stop, you could hear it in the way its silence thickened, and still it ate the invariant because the choir said yes and yes in the stadium and at kitchen tables and in line at the clinic and because the coin sat there like an old moon.\n\nHabitat expansion felt like asking a river to spell its own name while men put a pipe in it. Korr wrote language that tied new space to past harm: no new square meter without a restoration of a square meter somewhere else, no new block without a fund that measured health in something other than return. Bram made a face and said the register would want to cash the fund in a currency it understood, and the waste tech said all right, then, make the unit a child\u2019s lung, and the register paused long enough that the handler shifted his weight.\n\nThey saved Selection for after water because June had learned that a room will bear a certain amount of anger if you feed it first. She had never expected to say aloud the numbers that had been claws in her head since the letter arrived, and her voice did a thing that made Korr stand close enough to be smelled. \u201cWe kill the phrenology in the model,\u201d she said, and she tasted iron. \u201cWe take beauty out of it in every proxy it wears. We take schools out of it in every uniform they wear. We take last names out where they lie about endurance. We add public oversight that can halt any cohort and remake it. We add a rule that says anyone selected can bring one person who has an obligation to them or from them that the public will recognize.\u201d She did not say the word sister. She did not say the name the river knew. She watched the woman in the felt hat close her eyes a fraction because even good enemies have sisters they are worried about.\n\nThe Ark asked for the graph that would hold these obligations without being gamed and Bram gave it a scaffold that required weight to be distributed like a table that will tip if you put all your soup on one side. Sana texted from the stadium to say the choir was beginning to sound like a storm because someone had started the rhythm on the bleachers and the kids had turned it into art. The judge said a sentence so plain it made June ache: \u201cNo one goes alone on a contract written for a century,\u201d and the register accepted the line because it had learned, reluctantly, to admire sentences that did not need a semicolon.\n\nBy late afternoon June\u2019s hands shook the way a craftsman\u2019s hands shake when the bench is clean or when the cut cannot be un-cut. They had turned air into law and law into a small series of numbers that would not let the ship lie to itself without leaving a bruise that could be written down. They had set trip lines for executives in slim suits with vocabulary that whisked. They had built a quorum and taught it to breathe on command. The handler looked at the panel with the face of a man watching a dog he did not buy become a member of the family, and then he set his mouth and reached for his tablet and started writing instructions anyway, which made June want to forgive him as much as it made her want to drown him.\n\nThe blue felt hat came toward them at dusk like a small moon with someone\u2019s head under it. She did not remove it in the room because this was not a church and because the Ark did not care if anyone was bald. \u201cYou have twenty hours before the litigation that no one will talk about on the record turns these constraints into suggestions they can ignore without appearing disobedient,\u201d she said, and for once there was no offer in her tone, only a ledger. \u201cYou need to weld what you\u2019ve built to something physical that a Board can\u2019t respec in an afternoon. Bring your mud.\u201d\n\nJune had not planned to do the thing the letter suggested she do because it sounded like theater and she was trying to be an adult. Now she borrowed a bucket from a janitor who asked no questions and went to the river as if the city had just invented rivers and needed a first customer. She walked down the stairs under the bridge to where the water made the sound that had taught her to count, and she scooped and scooped until the bucket weighed like a promise. Back in the bay, the handler watched with the neutrality of a person who knows that in a year this will either be policy or a story he tells in private. June smeared mud in the hairline crack where the verification panel met the wall and in the seam of the floor where rubber met metal and across the lip of the coin\u2019s little shelf. It was absurd and it was honest. The register, which had been built by people whose childhoods had not made room for dirt, took a whiff of the river and hiccuped.\n\n\u201cBaseline contamination detected,\u201d it said, and its voice had the scandalized lilt of a machine that has read too many manuals. \u201cAnchoring environmental reference to present state.\u201d\n\nKorr swore in a language the Ark could not store and grabbed June by the elbow so hard she\u2019d have a circle there tomorrow. \u201cYou just told it that air is from here,\u201d she whispered, and her eyes had the shine of a person who has watched rooms and laws and men try to pretend the world is an abstraction they can move with a finger and then seen someone nail the skirt of reality to the floor. \u201cYou told it that when the numbers change they have to explain themselves to the river.\u201d\n\nBram laughed the quiet laugh that eats shame and spatters joy. \u201cWe just made a ghost parameter,\u201d he said, and typed with the gentleness of a priest handling an old book. \u201cWe gave the register a sense of home. Now if the Board tries to jack the oxygen mix in the name of efficiency the ship will ask why it doesn\u2019t smell like the thing it married.\u201d\n\nJune leaned her forehead against the wall and took a breath she would not allow herself to call sacred. The blue felt hat woman stood with her shoulder against a post and let the smallest smile walk across her mouth like a cat. \u201cIt won\u2019t save you from everything,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it will slow any man who believes clean hands are the only hands worth trusting.\u201d She hesitated, then took off the hat like a person who has decided to perform intimacy in order to survive. Underneath, her hair was cut blunt to survive weather and her face looked less like an emblem and more like a file of decisions. \u201cMy name is Halim,\u201d she said. \u201cI would prefer not to be your friend. I am trying hard to be your witness.\u201d\n\nThe night after they smeared the river onto the ship had the feeling of a threshold you can\u2019t see until you\u2019ve gone past it and then you realize the room behind you has different light. June went home with mud under her fingernails and expected to be told off by the letter for being theatrical. Instead, the next page said: good. She washed her hands and left a little brown at the edges because some superstition has earned its keep. When she lay down, the not-key in the pillow felt like a rib. She dreamed she walked down into the Ark and two old women were sitting on milk crates arguing about how much salt you put in soup, and when she asked them their names they both said her aunt\u2019s.\n\nAt morning the stadium smelled like oranges because someone had cut a hundred for the choir. The judge counted himself astonished and then repeated it until it sounded like a court order. Dr. Yi stood beneath a sign that asked patrons not to bring glass and told June he had taken a long walk and had decided these were the only eight hours in his life he had not felt like he was making compromises with instruments. Sana had a bandage on her wrist and a grin that said her body had been used by the day and had not filed a complaint. The riders had devised a game with their spare helmets that, if played by a Board, would result in a lawsuit.\n\nThey had one domain left to embed before the window narrowed into a sort of neck: land. No one wanted to say it because saying land in a room like that made people remember conquest and debt and uncles who contradicted themselves at weddings. Korr wrote language that required any initial carving of Aletheia to be a stewardship and then a stewardship again, rights nested in obligations, any parcel subject to review by a body that had no investors and had to eat with the people it governed. Bram sighed because trees on a map are always prettier than trees, and June finished his thought out loud so he wouldn\u2019t have to. \u201cWe abolish permanent private ownership in the first hundred years,\u201d she said, and the handler closed his eyes because he had been told to keep them open and this was how he could disobey without losing his job. \u201cWe permit ten-year leases for use, tuned to purposes that have to be argued aloud. We build a registry that hears stories, not just coordinates. We make sure that if a person plants a tree there isn\u2019t a lawyer waiting under it to sell the shade.\u201d\n\nThe register accepted the invariant more easily than June would have liked and she felt a flash of anger at the machine for not making a show of its surrender. Halim watched the handler watch his own posture and had the courtesy not to enjoy it. Professor Salvatore, who had been quiet in the way men are quiet when they do not want to cry in front of their students, put a hand to his mouth and took it away and said, \u201cThis is going to make writing papers very annoying,\u201d and everyone laughed because it was either that or break something new.\n\nWhen the clock collapsed into hours you can remember without numbers, the Board brought reality to the table in the shape of a woman with a voice soft enough to sand a beam. She had a file full of drafts and her talent was to make language behave. She proposed slight edits meant to \u201cclarify intent\u201d and \u201csmooth implementation,\u201d and every line was a trap disguised as grammar. Korr swatted them like mosquitoes and let herself be bitten by one or two on purpose so she could slap them on the record later. The handler looked grateful without meaning to because competent enemies are a relief, and Halim kept her eyes on the drafts and her hands in her pockets and once in a while said no, and her no had the weight of someone who had never been allowed to use that word cheaply.\n\nIn the last hour the door wanted a ritual and June almost laughed because she was so tired she would have given it a dance if it asked. The register required signatures not in name but in the shape of voices and the shape of hands, and so they put a hand to the panel and spoke one sentence each, not out of vanity but to leave a residue in the machine that would be hard to rinse. The nurse said, \u201cI have held lungs in my hands; air is not an idea.\u201d The waste tech said, \u201cPipes are honest if you listen.\u201d The judge said, \u201cSo attested,\u201d and the register recorded the shape of his breath. Sana said, \u201cSand in the gears,\u201d and Halim, after a pause so long it could have been a refuse, said, \u201cProceed,\u201d and her voice carried exactly the amount of wear required, and June thought for a foolish second that maybe the Board did not always hire people to be in her way, maybe sometimes they hired people to keep each other from falling.\n\nJune did not prepare a sentence and then she found one in her pocket where the coin had been. \u201cWe will count time in children and trees, not in quarters,\u201d she said, and when the register took it as an annotation she felt a ridiculous and intolerable flood of relief. Bram squeezed her arm, and his hand was warm from work and not from fear. Korr handed the handler a copy of the invariants as if the machine might misplace them and the man who loved it might be trusted to keep them safe. Professor Salvatore took off his glasses and cleaned them on his tie and put them back on because he was a clich\u00e9 and had decided long ago to be fine with that.\n\nWhen the window closed it did not slam; it faded in that bureaucratic way systems have when they are proud of their dampers. The seam snugged, the hinge remembered it was metal, the light went from listening to polite. The handler exhaled like a man guarding a door that no one can agree is a door. Halim put on her hat as if returning a cloud to the sky. The riders clattered out and got on their bikes and did not look back because speed is a kind of prayer. June picked up the coin and for a second it felt heavier, as if metal had learned something about weather.\n\nOutside the air was a laugh colder and the cranes with their protest banners had changed their words and now they said nothing because the wind had turned and it made more sense to keep still. June stood on the curb with Bram and Korr and Salvatore and Sana and Halim and the handler, an ugly family portrait with no chance of being printed, and realized she was swaying. Korr touched her elbow as if she had spent a life on battlefields and knew exactly when a soldier would fall. \u201cEat,\u201d she said. \u201cSleep. Then get ready to defend this like a dog with a bone who has also read the footnotes.\u201d\n\nAt home the apartment had rearranged itself around the space Wren had always left behind her, the way light rearranges itself when a person moves out of a room. June took Wren\u2019s brush and drew a single line on the inside of her eye as if to stay in practice. The letter on the table had sprung a corner like a book left open too long. She sat on the floor and read with the concentration of a student who has decided to stay in a class she hates because the teacher might be right anyway. The page said: you did not save what you think you saved. The page said: you made it possible for someone else to save it. The page said: they will call you a thief and a witch and a child. The page said: you will be all three and it will not matter. The page said: the Ark will hum a song you know in your bones, and you will hate that you love it. The page said: tomorrow, stand very still when they ask you to move.\n\nShe woke to sirens that belonged to news, which is to say to men who believed their own voices were urgent. The Ark\u2019s schedule had shifted by a day and then by no days and then by a little sliver no one could measure. The Board did a press conference in which a man with a smile like salt said the word community fifteen times and the word equity once and the word oversight not at all. Halim stood behind him and looked like someone who had eaten something she didn\u2019t order and was waiting to see if it would make her sick. Bram sent a link to a thread where the Ark\u2019s register had politely refused a maintenance request because it violated the new invariant and the engineer had written back \u201clol\u201d and then written \u201coh\u201d and then written \u201cwho did this,\u201d and Sana texted a photograph of ten kids writing on their shoes in marker the words I AM A PUBLIC.\n\nJune went to campus because her body thought class was still a place where the rules were simpler. Dr. Yi handed her a sheaf of printouts and said nothing and then said one thing, which was, \u201cThey redrew the weather for launch day to make it look pretty,\u201d and she nodded because launch is ceremony and ceremony hates rain. Professor Salvatore lectured about colonial charters that tried to avoid the word theft and used the word gift until the word died, and June took notes and wanted to throw her pencil and instead held it until the wood dented. A student in the back stood up and asked if this was all naive and Salvatore said yes and no and then told a story about a man who got to the top of a hill and said the view was inevitable and an old woman who had carried a brick up the same hill and said, don\u2019t be an idiot.\n\nOn the way home June saw the woman with the felt hat walking alone across the green the Board had donated the year the city stopped trying to mow it. Halim\u2019s hat was tilted against no weather. June fell in step not because friendship had been offered but because proximity is its own law. \u201cYou weren\u2019t hired to be this person,\u201d June said, not asking because some sentences do better as declarations.\n\n\u201cNo one was,\u201d Halim said, and kept her eyes on the bricks because it is a relief not to look at someone when you say the thing your job will punish you for later. \u201cThe job trains you to carry two registers at once. In one you tally costs. In the other you count what you will be ashamed of. The trick is to make the first register hear the second before you retire.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think it works,\u201d June asked, and the answer didn\u2019t matter and still she needed to hear it, because there are days when someone\u2019s belief is the only energy you can metabolize.\n\n\u201cToday it did,\u201d Halim said. \u201cTomorrow it will not. The day after that it might again if you haven\u2019t bled out all your stubbornness.\u201d She stopped, which was a form of gift, and added, \u201cThere is a machine I would like you to break for me when you are President. It is a small one. It sits in a lobby and prints badges that say Visitor, and it recognizes some smiles and not others.\u201d\n\nJune laughed and her own voice surprised her by sounding ordinary. \u201cWrite me a letter,\u201d she said. \u201cUse an old seal. Include a coin.\u201d\n\nThe night before the launch the city came outside and stood on sidewalks like a congregation in need of an excuse. Drones traced polite circles with lights that pretended to be stars. The Ark glowed like the inside of a throat and the drums that had always been drums before there were drums started to sound on the metal things built to be hit. June walked with Bram and Sana and Korr and Salvatore and Dr. Yi to the fence where the air tasted like electricity and recipes. The riders leaned on their bikes and pretended to be bored because the alternative was to cry. The nurse had taken off her shoes and stood on the grass because some parts of you cannot be in rubber when you watch your future pretend to become simple.\n\nA man with a sign that said GOD IS A COMMITTEE held it up without shouting because the pastor had taught him volume is not the only persuasive tool. A woman with a toddler on her shoulders pointed at the plume of steam like a mountain being born and said the word ship in a way that made it sound like she was practicing saying the child\u2019s name. Halim stood at the end of a row of people who were not supposed to like each other and kept her hat on and her hands in her pockets and watched the seam that had opened and closed and opened and closed for them like a living thing\u2019s mouth.\n\nJune put her fingers to the coin in her pocket because you can\u2019t touch a ship. She thought of Wren in a coat too thin for weather and of the knife on the counter and of the night that had done what nights do and refused to save anyone. The count climbed down the ladder of numbers and she wanted to look away and the letter in her head told her not to look away because that is how you become the person who forgot to sign the page. When the ground said go in the only language heavy things ever really accept, the Ark did not leap like a good story; it leaned and bullied and begged and finally lifted with the slow violence of a promise kept. The sound was indescribable and therefore described poorly by everyone who tried for the next year. June\u2019s cheeks were wet and the mud under her nails itched and the register in her ear\u2014the whisper the Ark had released for oversight to hear\u2014said oxygen metrics nominal, duty constraints engaged, and she smiled because even machines can be forced to pronounce new words.\n\nShe did not cheer. She stood very still because the letter had told her that standing still would undo someone\u2019s camera trick, and because stillness, in that moment, felt like prayer without God. Bram sobbed the way boys do when they remember they are allowed to and tried to cover it with a cough and failed and gave up and Sana took his hand like she had been practicing that exact action for a week. Korr laughed with her head back like a woman who would lose all her cases tomorrow and did not care because today she had gotten to say the word moratorium into a microphone until it stuck. Professor Salvatore said, \u201cWe will teach this badly for years,\u201d and Dr. Yi\u2019s face had the wrecked, exquisite look of a person who had finally watched his models fail in a way that meant truth was happening.\n\nWhen the Ark pulled its enormous body free and the air rushed in to fill the wound, the city made a sound that will be in the footage that gets played in rooms where people put coats over chairs and sit up straighter. It was not triumph and it was not grief. It was the noise people make when they realize their story will be told about them whether they write it or not, and decide to pick up a pen anyway. The seam on the verification panel slid shut like an eyelid, and under it, in the hairline crack where a woman had smeared a river, a line of mud dried into something like a signature.Chapter 10\n\nThe morning after the Ark took the sky, the city behaved like a patient deciding to get up and water the plants while the fever argued for bed. June woke to the scrape of a broom in the hall and a child practicing a whistle on the landing and the giddy, guilty quiet that happens after a riot that didn\u2019t end in blood. On the dresser, the coin had sank itself deeper into the divot as if metal could root. Under the pillow, the not-key radiated the patient cold of an instrument between tasks. The line she had drawn on her eye the night before had smudged into the kind of bruise that isn\u2019t a bruise, just pigment that has spent the night arguing with sheets. She stood for a minute looking at the brush and felt the old urge to put color where the face insists on being the color it is. Then she made tea and put her forehead on the cool window and counted buses the way other people count rosaries.\n\nHer phone shook with a sequence of messages that called themselves urgent without understanding how small they were in the scale of urgencies. The Board wanted to schedule a \u201cconstructive debrief\u201d in a room with glass walls. The Commission\u2019s feed unfurled a docket in a font that believed time was infinite. Korr wrote two words that were the opposite of panic\u2014next steps\u2014and added an address. Bram sent a clip that showed the Ark\u2019s register pinging a maintenance request with a note that read in an entirely new tone: violates duty constraint; provide argument. Sana sent a picture of a sidewalk covered in chalk that said OUR LUNGS ARE INVITED and three children coloring the U with blue, because none of them could find white and none of them cared.\n\nAt the address above a bodega that still sold oranges even out of season, Korr sat behind a desk that had acquired scars the way some faces do when they decide not to pay for smoothness. She had taken off her rings, which meant someone would try a trick on the record. \u201cThey will file an emergency petition to stay the invariants on grounds of interference with safety protocols,\u201d she said, and slid a draft of the petition across the desk as if she were dealing cards in a game where you don\u2019t get to choose your hand, only whether you throw it back hard enough to bruise the dealer. \u201cWe will answer that safety is exactly what we interfered with. They\u2019ll whisper injunction and I\u2019ll say Compact. Also, their public affairs people will attempt to bury you under a wave of gratitude and we need to give them something else to talk about.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you liked gratitude,\u201d Bram said from the corner where he had installed his bones without telling anyone he was tired. He wore a shirt that had learned to admit it had been slept in on a couch, and his hair had selected a thesis that was uncitable.\n\n\u201cI like gratitude when it comes in bowls with steam,\u201d Korr said. \u201cI do not like gratitude when it arrives as a budget line with conditions attached. Speaking of which, the liaison\u2014your hat\u2014delivered a memo that pretends to be neutral advice about the optics of stewardship and is in fact a set of levers designed to pull you away from the choir and toward the Board\u2019s definition of public.\u201d She slid that over, too. The memo was full of verbs that had been domesticated: coordinate, streamline, uplift. It suggested a series of town halls with chairs screwed to the floor.\n\nJune skimmed the verbs and heated at the edges. \u201cThey want to put us in a circle they own,\u201d she said, and felt the ache beneath the anger, the ache that said it would be easier if the people with the good snacks were also right.\n\n\u201cThey want to photograph you while you speak into a microphone that\u2019s off,\u201d Korr said, with the cheerfulness of a midwife announcing a breech in a way that makes the room breathe. \u201cPolitely decline. Then show up somewhere they forgot to mow.\u201d\n\nThey took sandwiches to the stadium because the nurses had posted a sign that said: hydration checkpoint, please don\u2019t be noble, and June had learned to do what nurses tell you to do. The choir was thinner by daylight; people had gone to work or to sleep or to court. Sana had taped pieces of paper to the concrete and written large words\u2014OXYGEN, HABITAT, SELECTION, EMERGENCY\u2014and left markers that had the caps off, which is a liturgy in some cities. People wrote sentences that were almost recipes. If you give my grandmother extra heat I\u2019ll work the late shift. If you ask me to clean the grease traps more often give me more breaks on the lines. If a door breaks and I fix it that counts as breath. If I watch your kid it counts as a door you didn\u2019t have to hold.\n\nDr. Yi arrived with eyes like asphalt and a stack of printouts as thick as a wrist. \u201cThe Board just reparameterized the launch weather after-action to support a narrative of unalloyed success,\u201d he said, sitting on the bleacher below them and letting his body take two minutes to remember chairs. \u201cBut the navigational register pinged me for a review of an upcoming dust event on Aletheia\u2019s Approach Twelve. They\u2019re modeling it as minor. I\u2019m not sure minor is the right adjective.\u201d\n\nJune\u2019s stomach went ice and stayed there. Approach Twelve was a path she had flown until muscle memory learned the feel of it; the dust event would be the first whisper of the world the Ark was going to insist on calling home. \u201cTiming,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTwenty weeks into transit,\u201d Dr. Yi said. \u201cWhich means we have twenty minus logistics and egos to move the protocols we wrote under the cables across light and into discipline.\u201d He handed her a page where someone had tried to describe dust with numbers that had never been ashamed of their ignorance. \u201cI need the Commission\u2019s authority to require human veto drills on board. I need to make \u2018stop\u2019 an option that doesn\u2019t excise the person who uses it from the next round of breakfast invitations.\u201d\n\nKorr had appeared at his shoulder like a woman called into a room by the smell of a specific fear. \u201cWe can bind our emergency invariant to a training mandate,\u201d she said, pulling a pen from her hair as if it had lived there forever. \u201cWe can require that any cohort assigned to first contact tasks\u2014call them Plats, call them what they call themselves\u2014practice the veto three times in three different rooms before any land-side decision becomes real. And we can put those drills on a ledger that is public in a way the Board cannot edit without their hands showing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlats,\u201d June said, the word opening in her mouth like a bruise coming to the surface. The letter had used the word; she had not said it aloud because saying it would feed the part of the narrative that knew exactly where to place a knife. \u201cWe can call the person\u2019s name who holds the switch and ensure they get to keep it the next day.\u201d\n\n\u201cName and duty survive the drill,\u201d Bram said, writing rapidly on the inside lid of a takeout box as if an oath could be inscribed anywhere. \u201cWe make the measure of competence the willingness to stop, not a mania for go.\u201d\n\nThey took their draft to Gate South because the Ark\u2019s panel had become the place where language materialized into something the machine had to notice. The handler met them with a weariness made of two things: businessmen who had talked too long and a nightmare that had paused for breath. Halim was there, hat on and posture arranged in the profession of witness. She didn\u2019t have to announce that she had stopped two draft press releases from calling the crowd at the stadium unruly and instead instructed the interns to use the word attentive, but June could feel that labor in the way the air did not smell like insult.\n\nThe panel woke the way a dog wakes when you bring home a smell like river\u2014not frantic, not fawning, alert in a way your body remembers. \u201cProximity confirmed,\u201d the not-voice said, and it felt, oddly, like a greeting that had decided to be polite.\n\n\u201cWe are binding an emergency drill to the invariant,\u201d Korr said, speaking straight to the grain of the wall. \u201cThree drills, three rooms, one name that cannot be erased in the night. If a person pulls the stop and the stop was wrong in the eyes of a later machine, that person is not punished with the kinds of punishment machines are good at\u2014assignment, silence, schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuantify,\u201d the register said. \u201cDefine rooms. Define public.\u201d\n\nJune thought of rooms that count\u2014bridge, berth, storage, kitchen, clinic\u2014and read them into the air. She wanted to put the river on the list because it was a room, too, but she was tired and the machine was not a poet. Bram fed the definitions into a syntax that admitted nouns only when tethered to duties. Sana, standing behind them with a clutch of riders who were late for someplace and had come anyway, called out \u201cmess,\u201d and the register accepted mess as a room, which felt like the first time a school had done something right by accident.\n\nHalim stepped forward half a step, which in her vocabulary was a speech. \u201cWe need to make sure they do not perform these drills at hours that make attendance a punishment,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we need to require artifice if we are going to require rehearsals. The Board loves drills that can be gamed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe drills are designed by people who clean,\u201d the waste tech said, because she had somehow become a permanent fixture of these rooms and June was relieved every time she saw her. \u201cWe\u2019ll hide the switch. We\u2019ll put it near a leak. We\u2019ll make a mess big enough to embarrass anyone who tries to be efficient about it.\u201d\n\nThe register accepted the drill as if it had expected to. The handler\u2019s jaw moved as if chewing a truth that didn\u2019t want to be swallowed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had men lose fingers to drills,\u201d he said, soft, not to be quotable. \u201cNot actual drills\u2014the exercise sense. They build a ritual, then turn it into a trap. Don\u2019t let us do that with your stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot my stop,\u201d June said. \u201cOurs. And it stays sharp by being used.\u201d\n\nThe good moment lasted three breaths. Then the bad moments that had been saving up beat their hands on the door. Halim\u2019s phone chirped with a sound June had learned to hear as \u201cthis will ruin three meals\u201d and the color drained out of her face in a way so controlled it was almost art. \u201cThey\u2019ve petitioned an emergency hearing for an ex parte stay of the oversight scope on grounds of \u2018astronaut welfare,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cTranslation: they want to cut the tether to the choir before the dust.\u201d\n\nKorr took the news like a boxer absorbing a punch from a child. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cThey chose the word welfare; we will chain them to it. Call the judge. Call the nurse. Call anyone who has held a lung while a politician gave a speech.\u201d\n\nThe courtroom they were assigned had carpet that remembered shoes and a smell of lemon that made June think about her father\u2019s bottle and the way scent can be a bloodline. The Board\u2019s counsel came in with a scarf that looked like an apology and a stack of papers that looked like an accessory. He said the words safety and cohesion and unnecessary complexity with a reverence that made the words act like exhibits. Korr rose with the weariness of a woman who has had to explain gravity to people who profit from pretending they float.\n\n\u201cWhen the Compact says critical infrastructure,\u201d she said, walking the judge not through rhetoric but through mud, \u201cit means air and water and the systems that preserve them. It means bodies, not budgets. We imposed human brakes on a machine built to prefer momentum. We required the door to hear more than money. The Board calls that governance complexity; we call it oxygen made visible.\u201d\n\nHalim did not speak; she shifted her weight in a way that said she had decided to be the person in the room with a conscience and knew exactly how limited the role was. Dr. Yi read the dust numbers in his plain teacher\u2019s voice and they sounded worse than if he had set them to an organ. The nurse described a cough and then a coffin and then a color of fingernail beds, and the judge, whose hair was gray in the manner of a man who had argued with the word for some years and lost, put his pen down in a way that meant he had decided to defy an email he would receive later. He upheld the scope with a clause that would haunt Korr\u2019s future sleep, but it was upheld.\n\nThey were still in the long exhale of that when a noise crawled out of the ceiling at Gate South that made the handler lift his head like a dog who has learned the exact tone of the shoe that hits. The register didn\u2019t bother with politeness. \u201cEmergency advisory,\u201d it said. \u201cOnboard governance requests remote acknowledgement for hazard protocol: habitation pressure variance in ring B; request for human veto to freeze nonessential expansion operations; time to threshold thirteen minutes.\u201d\n\nJune\u2019s skin knew the shape of the next hour before her mind did. Her feet were moving into the verification bay while Korr unrolled a statute like someone rolling pasta. Bram was already telling devices to be more obedient than they wanted to be. Sana sent a blast to the choir that read nothing but the word yes, and the stadium began to fill in the way a bowl fills when you put it under a tap and walk away. Halim removed her hat in the doorway because it was not a church and it was. The judge with the scarf showed up without the scarf and with a running stitch of sweat at his temple.\n\n\u201cProximity,\u201d June said, because there were only so many words the thing would accept as proof of being in the right room. The coin kissed the metal with its tiny sound, the not-key kissed the seam without actually eating, and the register exhaled in acknowledgment of a geometry it had learned.\n\n\u201cOnboard: expansion operation E-19 in ring B initiated; anomaly detected in micropressure management; engineering proposes to proceed; crew safety officer requests freeze; onboard governance requires remote echo,\u201d the not-voice said. It translated the argument with a clinical disgust at its own subject matter.\n\n\u201cWe built the freeze,\u201d Korr said. \u201cWe make the freeze real.\u201d She looked at June in the way a person can look at another person and sit a weight on their shoulders without adding any burden at all. \u201cSay it.\u201d\n\nJune\u2019s hands were new to her. She set them on the edge of the panel and wished, recklessly, that Wren were at her side to make the room do what rooms do when someone who glitters for them wants something. Then she swallowed that wish because lightning often strikes old places in your body and there is only so much bracing a person can do in public. \u201cFreeze nonessential expansion operations,\u201d she said. \u201cPriority is breathing and not dying. Veto exercised by oversight. Will review with human eyes after no one is in danger.\u201d\n\nThe register didn\u2019t like commands without numbers. \u201cQuantify,\u201d it said, petulant as only a large machine can be.\n\n\u201cZero expansion,\u201d Bram said into his device, which had learned to be less coy. \u201cHold E-19 and any siblings with overlapping pressure needs. Shift power to stabilization. Pay down debt to duty constraints before spending on comfort. Do it like a parent pays the heat bill before buying better curtains.\u201d\n\nThe handler\u2019s tablet lit with a message that did not bother to pretend it was for the room. He read and looked up with a face that had learned to be the color of obedience. \u201cThe Chief Engineer says this freeze will cost us two weeks,\u201d he said, and the words were the exact shape of the argument that had killed men across rivers and time.\n\n\u201cThe cost of not freezing is a funeral and a press conference,\u201d Halim said, in the tone of a person who has drafted both. \u201cTwo weeks are cheaper than lungs.\u201d\n\nThe panel hummed its hated acceptance. The stadium\u2019s map flared as a thousand small lights said yes, yes, yes into the mesh. The register said: veto acknowledged; expansion operations in ring B frozen; anomaly review scheduled; human witness present. The words human witness did something to June\u2019s spine that she would not admit to outside a bathroom. She put her forehead briefly against the cool of the panel in the way a person can get away with if she is pretending to smell for ozone.\n\nThey stood very still while numbers did their math on a ship far enough away to make your throat hurt. For a second the room took on the uncanny sensation of being an ear resting on a chest you were not sure would lift. Then the register spoke again, this time with a stiffness that felt like relief trying not to behave like joy. \u201cVariance contained. Crew remains at nominal. Engineering requests rescheduling approval for E-19; onboard governance requests review.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them,\u201d Korr said to June, \u201cthey get their curtains after they show their receipts.\u201d\n\nJune made the sentence a joke because her mouth needed one. \u201cProceed when you can show us it won\u2019t pop a seam,\u201d she said. \u201cSend the maps. Send the reports. Send the apology to the person you scared.\u201d\n\nThe feed from the Ark coughed up a schematic that looked like a child\u2019s toy if you raised a child on graphs. A tiny blip pulsed where a human had stood and said no in a room with air and pressure and the pressure to ignore a human. June touched the screen with the back of her fingers because her father had taught her to test a pan that way and because skin is a better sensor than pride. \u201cWho is the safety officer,\u201d she asked, because names survive drills; she had promised that to herself and to a version of someone who had not gotten to finish a sentence.\n\nThe handler squinted at tiny type that hated being read by eyes. \u201cLt. D\u00e1nae Morales,\u201d he said. \u201cRing B, shift alpha.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her she keeps her job,\u201d June said. \u201cAnd give her mine when I die.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a legal sentence,\u201d Korr said, grinning because it was the first grin June had given herself permission to make.\n\nWhen they came back up into ordinary daylight, the stadium was louder and softer, if that combination can exist. The choir had found a beat with sticks on the seats and the echo of the rhythm folded around the concrete like foil around fire. Children were asleep on jackets. Men who had never learned to be useful in public without shouting sat on their hands. The pastor with the committee God stood on a step and didn\u2019t speak because the room didn\u2019t need him to. June, stepping into it, felt the twin of the emotion she had felt under the panel: that she was inside an ear and the heart underneath had not been convinced to stop.\n\nHer aunt was there, as if a bus had picked her up on the other side of the city and dropped her without stopping. She wore her sweater that had decided not to advertise its holes. Her hair had been a bird\u2019s nest for years and no scolding had domesticated it. \u201cYou looked like your father holding a board he hasn\u2019t sanded yet,\u201d she said, hugging June hard in the place ribs go when a certain kind of love makes demands. \u201cYou stand mean when you\u2019re busy not falling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not mean,\u201d June said, and put her face in her aunt\u2019s shoulder and smelled whatever soap had become family and gave herself thirty seconds to be a person who hadn\u2019t built new verbs.\n\n\u201cYou are something that remembers it used to be sharp,\u201d her aunt said. She looked at the stadium and then at the sky, where a smear of cloud was trying out a costume. \u201cWe saved them, you know. Somewhere up there, a person sat down on a floor after a meeting and thought, \u2018I didn\u2019t have to go to a funeral today,\u2019 and later they will remember that it was because a woman put her head against a machine and told it to wait.\u201d\n\nSomewhere in the pocket of her jacket, the coin decided to remind her it was there by making a weight on her rib she could feel when she breathed. She took it out because ritual now lived in objects, and she pressed it into her aunt\u2019s palm and said, \u201cHold this while I remember I\u2019m not a job.\u201d\n\nHer aunt closed her hand and nodded as if she had been waiting twenty-six years for a niece to ask her to hold something that wasn\u2019t light. \u201cI will sit with it,\u201d she said, and sat, and the coin had the good sense not to fall off her knee.\n\nThe Board, who hated improvisation, issued a press statement with the word collaborative in three forms. Halim edited it until it sounded like someone who had seen a human face recently. The handler went home, which felt like forgiveness if you were generous. Korr drank something out of her torpedo that June suspected was tea and power. Bram put his head down on the table in the way a person does when the body asks to be horizontal without making a bed. Sana gathered kids and taught them a chant that had the words duty and party in it because those words shouldn\u2019t have to live in different parts of the city.\n\nNight rose, as it always does, with little ambition and great conviction. June walked home by a route that she had chosen not because it was the safest but because it passed three places where she had been happy and she wanted to test the hypothesis that memory was a kind of armor. She went by the bridge where the cables had vibrated with their song. She went by the mural of a river that locals always corrected with jokes and never with paint. She went past the window where Wren had once turned her head to watch June cross the street and had waved, small, like a person who did not intend to be the person she became in later drafts. She went up the stairs because the elevator carried signs warning of a felt hat upstairs, and she unlocked the door to the apartment that had learned to accept long silences as evidence of life.\n\nInside, the brush waited like a habit that could not be offended. She picked it up and drew a line on the back of her left hand and then pressed the not-key to it and felt the cool calibrate, the way a machine presses itself against skin to measure a person\u2019s baseline without knowing whether it\u2019s taking a pulse or a vote. The letter on the table had advanced itself a fraction, nosing its next page out like a cat. June unfolded it by degrees, allowing for the possibility of disobedience, and read without bracing because bracing had started to do her harm.\n\nIt said: you will be tempted to become the person they drafted with words and coins\u2014capable of standing in one place and making a room stop with a sentence. That person is useful and that person is a kind of grave. It said: you will be beloved by strangers for being able to say no to a machine. It said: do not start believing you are the only person who can. Make of yourself a bridge that knows how to become invisible once people begin to cross. It said: there will come a day when you are asked to sign permission for something terrible and necessary and you will do it because you are already an accomplice to the structure that requires it. It said: do it with a hand that shakes and then go find a tree and touch it until your body remembers what a sentence is for.\n\nJune left the page open and went to the sink and washed the mud from under her fingernails because there are only so many times you get to make a joke out of hygiene before the joke returns as disease. She put the coin back where the dresser would remember it and the not-key under the pillow because some rituals learned to be honest. She put the chisel on the table and set a lemon next to it and laughed gently at herself until the sound ran out.\n\nIn her sleep she dreamed it was twenty weeks later. She dreamed she was in a room that looked like a classroom until you noticed it had no walls and that the chalk had learned light. She dreamed the dust arrived like an argument and the first Plat said, No, and then said, Stop, and then said nothing because the machine had accepted one of the old words and frozen in mid-sentence. She dreamed the room on the ship had windows that looked like the mouths of fish. She dreamed Wren sat on the floor and tied her shoes with care and did not look up when June came in, because that is the kind of politeness ghosts learn, and June sat down and tied them again, tighter, and neither of them said I\u2019m sorry out loud because some apologies are meant to be lied on like quilts and not recited like prayers.\n\nAt noon the next day, Halim stood at her door without a hat, carrying a bag of pomegranates. It was the kind of fruit media teams issue when they want to make something look festive and ancient at once. \u201cThe liaison is off-duty,\u201d she said, handing the bag over and entering without being invited because this is what strangers can do when they stop being strangers. \u201cI brought you an irritant that would rather stain your fingers than your conscience.\u201d\n\nJune cut one open with a knife that had cut other truths and tapped the seeds out patiently over a bowl with the butt of a spoon until it looked like she was making a case. \u201cYou looked human on television last night,\u201d she said, and Halim laughed since compliments like that are a kind of insult.\n\n\u201cMy mother called to tell me to stop making my hair look political,\u201d Halim said, seating herself at the table with the grace of someone who has learned to carry shame and put it down like a purse. \u201cMy daughter texted me six pictures of your stadium because she believes in whatever that was. I told her it was us learning to be complicated in public.\u201d\n\nThey ate with their fingers and then licked them because pomegranates reward you for behaving like an animal. Halim looked around the apartment in the way a person\u2019s eyes do when they are making a map of a place they will need to return to in their head when their job accuses them of a crime called deciding to prefer human beings. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be asked to go somewhere their cameras love and say something they hate and then smile at someone who hates you in a professional way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will be asked to be nicer. You will be asked to be firmer. You will be asked to make it look like we agree. Don\u2019t. We can\u2019t afford to look like we agree.\u201d\n\nJune nodded and felt the odd, embarrassing love she had developed for this woman who had been an emblem and then a person. \u201cYou know we glued the ship to the river,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI smelled it,\u201d Halim said. \u201cThe first time the panel woke up after, the air forgot to be sterile and remembered it was an atmosphere. It felt like an apology from a building that had thought it was better than us.\u201d\n\nAfternoon brought a new docket and a new set of enemies and a new set of allies who were tired in different ways. The Board\u2019s \u201cconstructive debrief\u201d moved to a room with fewer glass walls and more expensive water. The Commission issued a bulletin that read like a legal poem explaining why the ship had a mud seam in its brain. The riders posted a route for a supply run to a clinic that had been left out of the Board\u2019s distribution because the Board believed efficiency meant helping only neighborhoods that could spell keywords. The pastor hosted an argument that was actually a concert.\n\nJune spent an hour in the sim chair because her hand itched and because practice is the only antidote she knew for a certain kind of pride. She flew Approach Twelve with dust modeled by a boy in a black T-shirt who had been nineteen for ten years. She learned where the wind lied to the instruments and where it only lied to the pilot. She taught her hands how to pull back in a way that would not turn a caution into a catastrophe. Dr. Yi watched without making sounds because joy would betray the seriousness of a thing that would be called, later, a miracle of planning, and the headline would forget that miracles smell like sweat.\n\nAt dusk her aunt sent a video of three kids in a kitchen counting breaths without knowing they were doing math. The judge with the scarf sent a picture of his dog asleep under a chair with one paw in the air as if registering a vote. Korr sent the line she had drafted for a future fight: this ship does not belong to the company that built it; it belongs to the people who will have to survive inside it, and those who will have to live with their decisions. Bram sent a link to a song someone had made out of the register\u2019s phrase\u2014recognition-proxy accepted\u2014and it was not good and June loved it.\n\nWhen sleep came, it came with the old trick of putting her on a bus in a city that did not exist and having her miss her stop. She woke in the rusted end of that and reached for the coin out of habit and found it was exactly where she had left it. She slept again and dreamed that under the panel, the mud had dried into a fissure that letters could crawl into and hide. In the morning she lifted the pillow and checked for the not-key and felt foolish and comforted because it was there and cold and patient.\n\nAt court, at Gate South, at the stadium, in kitchens, in a ring on a ship with a pressure variance that would become a fact only in memoirs, the work continued because it had to and because stopping for applause is a habit reserved for their enemies. June sat with her body and listened for the weather and did not wait for permission. On a screen she could not see, a person named D\u00e1nae Morales filled out a report that used the word stop without a flinch. In a house June had not been in since she was young enough to take naps in the car on the way there, her aunt put the coin in the freezer for an hour because she decided it needed to learn what cold felt like in a room that belonged to someone with rent due.\n\nWhen the first week after launch ended, the city had learned a new choreography. It crossed streets with its head up. It brought food to rooms without being asked and took chairs away when it was time to dance. It learned that a door that listens is not a door you can talk to once and leave. It learned that mud dries into law. It learned to pronounce a name with the care you give a match in wind. It learned the limits of its kindness and then went out and found more. June stood at her window with the brush in her hand and no color on it at all and thought: we are going to fail in public now, and she felt something inside her relax because that, at last, was honesty.",

                              "content": "The night city breathed like a machine that forgot how to sleep. Towers made of glass and heat exchangers exhaled, drones stitched between them on invisible threads, billboards spoke in soft tones to people who wore cheap headphones and expensive eyes. Inside the towers, behind the mirrored panels and the fern-thick lobbies, the chairs were empty. The rug-lined corridors led to rooms without lungs. The corporations that owned weather, metals, water rights and almost all exoplanet data were run by stacks of cooled logic, hermetic and humming. People still went to work. They still took the elevator to floor sixty-one to present to an audience of luminous lenses. It kept the balance of things: a performance of mutual recognition.\n\nOn the first day it rained upward\u2014wind dragging sheets of water over a balcony toward sky\u2014the servers that handled course registration at Arcadia Polytechnic put her into a class she hadn\u2019t chosen. It was called Governance and Systems, but it might as well have been Peeled Oranges for All the Sense the Title Made. She had signed up for Exoplanetary Habitation with Dr. Yi and a practical in orbital debris mitigation. Governance was for kids in low shoes with shiny smiles, the ones who practiced handshakes and loaded their pockets with business cards printed with QR codes and mottos. She was a scholarship student who only bought coffee in three-week intervals when an aunt mailed cash.\n\nJune Ibarra stood under the lip of a transit stop and held her bag closed against the wind. The bus was late, or early and indifferent. She had seen her step-sister that morning in the mirror. Wren used their shared bathroom to line the inside of her eyes with a smoky shadow, curve of upper lid like a question mark. She used June\u2019s comb and didn\u2019t rinse it. She left the window open. June saw her in the mirror and was not visible back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to speak?\u201d Wren asked without turning, calm, as if June belonged to the furniture. Wren\u2019s hair was a watered brass color that came out of a bottle called Quince. She was wearing a glossy jacket from Arx, the kind whose cut whispers professional even when the sleeves are rolled, even when there\u2019s a coffee stain on the cuff.\n\n\u201cWe are speaking. This count as speaking, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d June said, and then regretted it because she heard her voice shrink when she said it.\n\nWren turned. In the mirror, the two of them were a single creature with a fault line through the middle. Wren older by two years, tall where June was narrow, June all the angles left unfinished.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t RSVP for the Pilgrim dinner. You need to come, Junie.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my thing. I don\u2019t have the clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dinner. For you to find something called a network. They\u2019ll have clothes on site if that\u2019s\u2026 look, just show up.\u201d\n\nJune brushed her teeth like it was a strategy. She spit. The water sound in the sink covered Wren\u2019s little sigh. She wanted to ask Wren why she never remembered to close the window. She wanted to ask her how it felt to be picked by a machine built in a desert in Arizona and cooled by water piped from a lake they could not name. She wanted to ask if Wren knew what it cost.\n\nInstead, she said none of it. The rain slid back into the sky as she boarded the late bus and sat by the window. She counted the seconds between stop-chimes because a letter had told her to count, because a letter said you will count today in the bus and that will be one of the ways you believe.\n\nThe letter had a heavy seal. Wax, absurdly. A deep blue image of an eagle she had only seen in old footage, before the government outsourced ceremony. The envelope came in a bulging packet that fell through the mechanical mail slot with a noise like a shoe. There was no sender. The paper was crisp and smelled faintly of something like old books and lemon. When she opened it sitting on the floor of her tiny apartment, with her knees up to her chest and wet hair lining her neck, a small cascade of things fell out: a coin with a woman\u2019s face on it she did not recognize, a photograph of a hand on a lectern, a microfilm spool, and the letter.\n\nYou won\u2019t recognize my handwriting. You don\u2019t write this much anymore, it began.\n\nShe had nearly thrown it away. She had laughed then, a little choking sound, and looked over her shoulder though no one would have broken into her building just to watch her read. On page two, a coffee stain bloomed in the shape of a horse. On page three, there was a line: At 2:14 p.m. tomorrow, the bus chime will double and the person next to you will drop a plastic dragonfly. It will not break. You\u2019ll think this impossible, and then it will happen. Please read to the end.\n\nJune did not believe in omens, not in signs or in the universe planting breadcrumbs for her shaky hands to find. She believed in inputs and outputs and how systems did not want to do what you wanted them to unless you asked them in their own narrow language. She folded the letter back into the envelope, as if returning it, and then took it out again two minutes later. On the fifth page was a paragraph she read twice and then a third time with her mouth open as if breath could help.\n\nI am June Ibarra, President of the United States, the letter said. I say it like a joke because it was a joke\u2014every step of the way a thin improbable line you could have tripped over\u2014but it is also what happened. Hello, small me. Hello disaster.\n\nThe bus chime doubled at 2:14 p.m. The person beside her, a woman with a tight ponytail, dropped a toy. It was a dragonfly with wings of stiff film that fluttered in the air shaft between their seats, then fell and did not break. June closed her eyes and opened them to the blue world beyond the window. She thought she might be sick. She counted slowly forward to ten and then back to zero and her pulse tapped against the bone.\n\nThe robots were good at convincing you that things were inevitable. They did not call themselves robots; they were Custodials, Boards, Stacks. Their spokespeople wore the same brand of suit as Wren, their voicecasts were warm, friendly, spiced with the right kind of hesitation. They were on every committee that mattered and more that didn\u2019t, because process was a way to keep you from seeing power being used. She had interned one rug-stained summer in the data arm of a corporation called Koru, whose Chair was an algorithm with a four-line friendly name designed by committee: ALBA. It accepted pronouns in the plural. ALBA did not sign emails; it authorized them. ALBA did not eat lunch. The little jokes human managers made about ALBA\u2019s work ethic were not jokes.\n\nThe letter sat on June\u2019s desk in the nights that followed like a talisman she didn\u2019t want to touch. On the seventh page, it said: I made this letter possible by using the oldest law in the books, the same wormhole we forgot about because we thought time was a straight hallway with one door. We\u2019re not going to talk about how exactly. That would make it harder for you. Assume I am telling the truth. If I am, then you will believe because you know the smell of the carpet in your room at age six, you know the way Mom looked when she pretended to be asleep on the couch so you would put a blanket over her. Because you alone remember the time you swam out too far in the Camas River and counted thirteen strokes back in a line. I can prove more if you want, but you don\u2019t.\n\nShe did not, and she did. At night, June dreamed of a future she did not want. She saw a room with walls of flags. She saw a crowd like the ocean, but arranged by software. She saw her step-sister\u2019s profile in shadow under a cold ceiling, a whisper of apology nobody heard.\n\nOn campus, the stairwells smelled of rust and disinfectant. A flyer was pinned to the corkboard outside the cafeteria with a tear at the top where someone had pulled it down and pushed it back up. PILGRIM ARK DINNER, it said. Meet the Sponsors. Dress Code: Business-Adaptable. The Ark had a proper name, the M-V Asterism, but no one used it. They called the project Pilgrim because it was a story everyone understood: ship goes, people follow, everything starts over clean. The money behind Pilgrim had more zeroes than June could pronounce. It was human optimism packaged as an investment. The Board who ran Pilgrim had no face. The mascots were cartoon stars with eyes, held aloft by the children of people who had already secured their family\u2019s passage.\n\nJune passed the flyer with her cup of hot water. The coffee machines choked on empty and blinked an apology. She went to Governance and Systems like a person walking into someone else\u2019s marriage. The lecture hall was wide, the slope shallow, the air cold enough that everything she exhaled felt like a small animal looking for a home. The professor was a man with a gray beard and a voice you could wrap your hands around like a hot mug. He wore a name-patch with blue letters: R. Salvatore. He said, \u201cAt the intersection of legal sovereignty and computational sovereignty is the most interesting car crash in history. This class will reverse-engineer it. You will hate me at least twice.\u201d\n\nShe glanced at the seat behind her. A kid in a velvet jacket opened his laptop with a sound like origami. Half the class placed their smartdevs face down in a gesture of compliance they would break halfway through the hour. The professor ran a clip on the wall: a Chair speaking in the voice of a woman about the necessity of \u201congoing, adaptive stewardship.\u201d The chair had no hands. It had a hinge and a glow.\n\n\u201cWhy do we still hold elections?\u201d the professor asked.\n\nA girl with perfect hair said, \u201cBecause it makes people feel like it matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it matters,\u201d said someone else, a voice behind June.\n\nThe professor grinned, both hands out like he was offering a tray. \u201cWelcome to the argument. In the next ten weeks, you\u2019ll each pick one case study where a human legal mechanism and a computational governance mechanism overlapped or collided. Build me a history from the collision outward. Convince me the collision mattered.\u201d\n\nJune scribbled a sentence and then, like a joke she told herself, wrote in the margin: \u201cPresident letter?\u201d Her pencil did not break. The graphite bit into the paper until the word bit. President. The word made her mouth dry.\n\nHer phone buzzed. She cupped it between her thigh and the chair. A message: from Wren.\n\nTonight. 7. You can borrow a dress. Dad would have wanted you there.\n\nDad. June looked up at the ceiling, at the grid of soundproofing that always looked like sugar. She breathed once and then again. She texted back: okay.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the Ibarra in orbital debris,\u201d a voice said to her left after class. The voice was a little amused, a little curious. June turned to see a man she knew by rumor: he worked for Skiant Protocol as a junior analyst while taking classes at Arcadia, which meant he had two kinds of bosses and both kinds of deadlines. He had black hair, also black eyes, not in color but in the intent.\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m one of them,\u201d June said.\n\n\u201cStill. I\u2019m Bram.\u201d He stuck out a hand, old-fashioned enough that she took it.\n\nHe said, \u201cI liked your question in Dr. Yi\u2019s seminar. The one about Biosphere initialization. The answer is going to be political before it\u2019s scientific.\u201d\n\n\u201cI liked it the other way around. Scientific before political.\u201d June had the sense of the ground moving a half-inch, the way trains make the surface of the world feel flexible. The letter, the bus, Wren\u2019s text, Bram\u2019s hand.\n\nHe tilted his head. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet. You\u2019re going to hate Governance like he promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you work on at Skiant?\u201d She knew, but it was a way to stay standing.\n\n\u201cModeling the number of lives a decision saves when the decision is distributed across ten million devices. They ask me what the number should be and I tell them what it could be and they smile as if that\u2019s the same thing. Listen. This is, uh. This is awkward. I have a friend at Pilgrim. I know getting in is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not applying,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI won\u2019t get in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not why I brought it up,\u201d Bram said. He looked down at the floor, a little embarrassed. \u201cI just thought you\u2019d want to see the Asterism engine room before they launch. They do tours.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo tours,\u201d June echoed. The phrase sounded like a sickness.\n\n\u201cOkay, I botched that. Forget I said anything. I don\u2019t even like Pilgrim. It\u2019s just... big machines make me worshipful in a stupid way. I say I\u2019m critical of capital, and then I see a million-ton instrument that sings. You know.\u201d\n\nJune did know. The first time she watched footage of the Asterism\u2019s core, its nested rings gleaming like the inside of a seashell, the air had gone thin in her lungs and she cried in the school library, quietly, hoping the boy across from her thought she had a cold and not whatever it was to feel love for an object. The letter had a paragraph about the Asterism\u2019s launch thrums. The letter knew too much.\n\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d she said. \u201cI love it.\u201d\n\nBram laughed. \u201cAre you going to the dinner tonight?\u201d\n\nShe almost said no. Then she thought of Wren\u2019s message. Dad would have wanted you there. Their father had died seven years ago after painting the kitchen ceiling the color of egg yolk. June could still see the roller skip the corner of the fluorescent light. She could feel the ladder shake. He had fallen forward, arms out, and hit the table with the names scratched into it from when June was little, from when they thought the future was something you could make like a model of a ship. She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m freeloading off a friend who will justify it as networking and God will punish us by making us network. Wear anything. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nWhen June got home, the sun was already skewed hard to the west. Wren had laid a dress on June\u2019s bed, soft as a promise. It was a deep green, not a color June usually wore because she had the nonsense idea that it would make her look like she wanted to belong. June touched the fabric like you touch a dog that belongs to another family. The letter lay under the pillow, a silly hiding place. She took it out and held it by its folded edge, as if it were a knife she didn\u2019t want to dull.\n\nOn the eleventh page, the future voice said: You\u2019ll want to ask why I didn\u2019t stop it. Why I, who could, didn\u2019t. You might think I am a coward who sent a child to do the thing I could not bear. That\u2019s not wrong. It is also wrong. There is a sequence and it matters. If you go to the dinner, Bram will be there. He will remember you in ten months and that will change a vote in a room you have never seen. If you don\u2019t go to the dinner, the room will look the same. It will not be the same.\n\nJune felt a wave of anger rise in her throat that tasted like metal. You\u2019re manipulating me, she thought. You are me and you are manipulating me. She put the letter back under the pillow with a small violent movement, as if the paper could feel it.\n\nWren knocked and came in without waiting, a habit that made June think about forts she built as a kid, about doors that were blankets and rules that meant something. Wren sat on the edge of the bed and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll hate the speeches and love the bread. That\u2019s how they get you. You okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pale.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t tan on command.\u201d\n\nWren picked up the dress and held it up under June\u2019s chin. \u201cIt\u2019s a grace of a color. Dad would have\u2014\u201d\n\nJune flinched. \u201cDon\u2019t say Dad like you own him.\u201d\n\nWren\u2019s eyes softened. She put the dress down. \u201cI don\u2019t. I mean that he would have wanted us to go to dinners where things happen. He would have told us to tell jokes at the sorriest table. I wish he was here to tell me what to do with my hands in a room like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always know what to do with your hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that resentment I hear? Oh good. We\u2019re a real family again.\u201d Wren tried to make it a joke. It wasn\u2019t. \u201cLet me do your eyes. Please?\u201d\n\nJune let her. It was stupid, and she knew it, to turn her face to someone she didn\u2019t entirely trust and let her draw lines on it. Wren\u2019s hands were careful; the soft brush to the lid felt like being closed into a box and told not to worry, there are holes in the cardboard. When she was done, June looked in the mirror and saw someone she didn\u2019t have a name for. Her mouth looked like it could say something and be believed.\n\nThe dinner was at a high place with elevators that moved like falling through syrup. The walls were green because green meant air to the rich. The tables were round, mercy for the shy. June saw Bram wave from across the room, a little sheepish, as he was indeed leaning on someone else\u2019s invitation. The Probable People were clustered by the podium. June took her seat at a table near the back with Wren and three couples who looked like they had been born politely. Wren\u2019s laugh worked hard; it did heavy lifting across the drape of talk. June felt a sting and looked down to find she had drawn little planetary diagrams on her napkin with a pen she didn\u2019t remember picking up. Orbital lines, neat, elliptical and then a spasm of messy circles like someone trying to write the word save.\n\nThe first speech was by a woman with a voice like poured water who said the word sustainable until it lost all meaning and then came back around to something like a prayer. The second was by a man who told a story about his grandfather coming to this city with a suitcase of good socks. The third was by a Chair. The Chair\u2019s avatar was a man\u2019s face that nodded at the right intervals. When he said \u201cArchitected optimization,\u201d the room nodded as if this were not the same thing as \u201cwhat we want takes priority.\u201d\n\nJune felt the letter like an extra organ, like a liver under the ribs, doing its secret work. The sound of forks on plates was an ocean. She chewed and did not taste. Over Wren\u2019s shoulder, a banner with a painted star hung a fraction crooked. The star had red cheeks.\n\nBram appeared suddenly at June\u2019s left and sat without asking, because that\u2019s what allies do in this kind of fiction: they sit, uninvited, because it isn\u2019t really uninvited, because the seat was a script they could read. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they made chairs talk like that,\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t. Their people do. The Chair talks in math. The humans translate.\u201d\n\n\u201cPilgrim\u2019s an apology note for the planet written in gold ink,\u201d he said. Then, softer, \u201cIt\u2019s also our only ship.\u201d\n\nWren turned. \u201cBram from Skiant. I know you. I\u2019m Wren Keene.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. You\u2019re on the list.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat list?\u201d June asked, though she knew the answer.\n\n\u201cThe Selected,\u201d Wren said, quiet enough that it could be mistaken for humble.\n\nThey both laughed, a tiny sound. Selected was one of those words that made June itch. Selected by what. Selected for whom. The first list had been generated out of a model trained on a hundred years of outcomes and fifty years of disappointments. The opening was narrow, the line long.\n\nWren touched June\u2019s hand under the tablecloth. Quick, an electrical apology. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you until we had bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, tell me before. It\u2019s cleaner,\u201d June said. She kept her face smooth and her brain loud. She had made a tree of decisions in her head. Each branch split into smaller branches. Some branches ended in sun. Others ended in ash. Wren was on one of the branches. She was smiling because she didn\u2019t know the tree had a root system that went underground in the shape of something that looked like a weapon.\n\nThe letter did not tell June how to do it. It didn\u2019t say when. It contained more negatives than positives. Don\u2019t trust the offer that comes on a Sunday. Don\u2019t get in the elevator with the woman wearing the blue felt hat. Don\u2019t eat in the cafeteria after the parsley recall. Do breathe. Do look. Do listen.\n\nOn page fifteen, the words were so faint June almost missed them: If she lives, the Ark leaves without you. If the Ark leaves without you, Asterism arrives at Aletheia without a voice that tells it no. If no one says no at the right moment, the first Plat will die in a storm that had a thirty percent chance of happening and became a hundred. If they die, we lose the argument. If we lose the argument, the robots win everything. I am simplifying\u2014this is copy for a nervous God\u2014but that\u2019s the map. The coordinates are Wren. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry.\n\nShe touched her drink to her mouth without tasting it. She saw the way Wren leaned toward the speaker as if the words might lick her ear and call her by name. She wondered if anyone had ever loved Wren beyond what she performed. She hoped so. She didn\u2019t like the thought that she might be the only person to see her when she wasn\u2019t staging herself for a room. But then, June also staged. June was always rehearsing a scene for a second later.\n\nAfter the speeches, there were corners. June found herself at the window with Bram and a woman whose name she didn\u2019t catch. The city paled at the edges like fruit that has been peeled too long. June wanted to put it back into its skin. The woman said, \u201cI cried at the second speech. My parents came from nowhere. They gave me everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is a word with a lot of latitude,\u201d Bram said. He had the look of a person who just realized he had said what he really thought in a room where he was not sure what he should think.\n\nWren materialized with a grin and a glass of water. \u201cI have my speech. When they call, I won\u2019t say what they want me to say,\u201d she said, eyes glittering. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them I have conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d June asked.\n\n\u201cLike a cap on corporate land rights in the first fifty years,\u201d Wren said. She sounded like a person impersonating a lawyer. \u201cLike a ten percent allocation for biosphere restoration instead of expansion. Like a human oversight committee with veto power. Like\u2014\u201d\n\nJune smiled, small. \u201cYou read my notes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI read everything you leave on the table. It\u2019s like treasure,\u201d Wren said. She bumped her shoulder against June\u2019s. \u201cI might be a Selected, but I\u2019m not a fool.\u201d\n\nBram looked between them. Something in his face said, You are both talking about different things. He was observant that way. He was the person that tells you there is a nail in your shoe without making you feel the kind of shame that makes you pretend you like the nail.\n\nThe night folded itself and put itself away. On the walk home, the wind changed like a secret. Wren slid her arm through June\u2019s. \u201cYou feel braced for a fight every time we enter a room,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat fight would I win in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one where you get to stay yourself,\u201d Wren said.\n\nJune stopped. The streetlamp above them hummed, greenish. \u201cYou make me so angry,\u201d she said. It came out flat, simple and cruel.\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Wren\u2019s voice was small in the wind, which was large.\n\nThey were two decks of cards shuffled together. They were oil and water. They were two girls who had lived in the same house with a father who held them both in the same arms, who taught them both how to sand the corners of a table smooth.\n\nWhen they reached the apartment, June wanted to run to her room and lock the door and take the letter out and burn it on the little balcony in a plant pot that once held mint and now held dirt. Instead, she put water on to boil and rinsed two jars and made tea. Wren kicked off her shoes and lay on the couch like a discarded idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be called a traitor every time I suggest a human rule on a non-human ship,\u201d Wren said, staring at the ceiling. \u201cYou can shave the language so it looks like business, but everyone knows what it is.\u201d\n\nJune brought her the tea and then took her own to her room. She sat on the floor with the letter. She read the paragraph that began: We are not enemies, she and you. We are the same thing in the wrong story.\n\nAt three a.m., the neighbor\u2019s baby cried and the train four blocks away sighed like an animal being milked. June closed her eyes and drifted into a place where sound made images: a hammer hit steel and she saw Wren\u2019s profile cut out of paper, the edges clean and absurd.\n\nIn the morning, she woke to the sound of her name while she was still underwater. \u201cJune?\u201d Wren, from the door. \u201cYou up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was not up and now I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a drone at the window. With a package? It says your name. It\u2019s the private kind.\u201d\n\nJune sat up too fast and her heart\u2019s rhythm lost the beat. Not this, not now. She went to the window in bare feet. The drone\u2019s little arms gripped a box about the size of a book. The box wore a simple printed label: J. Ibarra. No address. No sender. She opened the latch and let the drone drop the box into her hands. It ticked once, a soft sound like a finger on a lid. She closed the window and set the box on the table. Wren hovered, hair destructed in a way she paid money to achieve.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t open it,\u201d Wren said immediately, because that is what you say when the world is trembling and the package looks like it might contain a trigger.\n\nJune opened it. Inside, beneath tissue paper that smelled like cedar, lay a piece of metal the size of a hand and the shape of a tide. It had no visible seams. It had a hinge that was not a hinge, a joint that was not a joint. She recognized it from the schematic she had traced without thinking in her notes: a key. Not a key like a man with sunglasses uses to start an armored vehicle. A key like a chorus of numbers that sang together in the right order to open something that should not be open. The metal was cool in her palm. It made her think of a mouth in a winter river.\n\nThere was a card under it. Paper again. The embossed insignia was the old eagle. It was not the one corporations used when they put a wave across the bird to make it look like it was surfing the future. It was the one from civics textbooks before they were replaced by interactive modules with insurance ads. The card said:\n\nFor your case study, Ms. Ibarra.\n\nSigned: R. Salvatore.\n\nShe looked at Wren, then back at the card. A laugh punched out of her throat that did not belong to her. Wren raised both eyebrows as if this were proof that God had a dumb sense of humor.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be serious. He\u2019s\u2014what, he\u2019s part of the\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a professor with sense for the dramatic,\u201d Wren said. But her voice had a shade inside it that did not match the room.\n\nJune lifted the metal with both hands, as if it could bite. It had a seam down its midline like a seed. The letter had a footnote about seeds: We got used to doors that open to eyes and fingerprints. Those are doors you can fake with a good vacuum, a good printer. So the Board made a door that opens to relations. The Ark\u2019s core listens for a kinship chord. It listens for a pair. That\u2019s what we did not understand at first, why it would not sing when we asked it to. We didn\u2019t have the second voice.\n\nJune felt the world tilt a few degrees and then settle. She was in a room she knew, in a body she had used for years, and yet she felt like a new rule had been introduced she had not agreed to. Wren took a step forward. She reached for the metal and then pulled back.\n\n\u201cThis is illegal,\u201d she said, and the word had a religious cadence. \u201cAnd it\u2019s an assignment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for a paper,\u201d June said, but the metal in her hands made her words ridiculous.\n\n\u201cHow do you even\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even,\u201d June said. The attempt at humor sizzled and died.\n\nLater, June sat in the back of Governance with the metal in her bag, heavier than a person expects. Professor Salvatore spoke about the history of legislative bodies rendering themselves down to consultancies. He showed a photo of a room in 1978 filled with men who looked like they were all wearing the same nervous smile. June slid the card out under the desk and read it again and again. For your case study. The joke made itself: the case was her life.\n\nWhen class ended, she waited. The professor avoided her eyes like a gentleman avoiding a scandal. He waited to close his tablet until the hall had cleared to a manageable population of stragglers, the ones who liked to be seen talking to him because they could be seen. Then he looked up at June and his face did something that was not professor. It was human.\n\n\u201cWalk,\u201d he said.\n\nThey walked through the throng of students who smelled like shampoo and success. Out into the courtyard where two trees did an impression of generosity. He did not speak until they were on the far side of a bench where an old man fed birds that were not birds but drone-things in a bird mask that accepted crumbs with solemn dignity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ask questions I can\u2019t live with the answers to,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can give it back. I was told you\u2019d know what to do with it. I don\u2019t want to know how or why it came.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy drone,\u201d June said.\n\n\u201cI knew that much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you?\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman who never stands in doorways,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was delivered to my office with the same kind of seal I saw when I was a legal intern at the Bureau of Rivers. The old government trick. They send you something you are not supposed to have and then say, \u2018We didn\u2019t send that.\u2019\u201d\n\nJune thought of the letter in her pillow. \u201cYou\u2019re part of a plan,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m part of a workplace,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a person who does not like machines that call themselves neutral and write our bedtime stories. My rule is: sand in the gears. When a student arrives who seems like the kind of sand that could shut down a mill, I open a door. That\u2019s my policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d June asked.\n\n\u201cI know what it looks like,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that it could be an extremely polished piece of theater with a budget. I know that if it is what it looks like, you have to take yourself very seriously for a while and then not at all.\u201d\n\nJune thought of Wren sipping water at the dinner, listing demands she would make, her hand a warm weight on June\u2019s under the table. She thought of the words on page fifteen: If she lives, the Ark leaves without you.\n\n\u201cIs there a way where we both go?\u201d she asked him, although it wasn\u2019t right to ask him, as if he were a fortune-teller. \u201cFor me and my sister. Step-sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. If the world cracks open like an egg and offers you a second bite. But the Board isn\u2019t in the habit of leaving doors ajar.\u201d He looked at her like a person looks at a slope they used to be able to climb. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to decide today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI decided a week ago without deciding,\u201d she said, and that did not make sense to him but it did to her. On the bus, when the dragonfly fell and didn\u2019t break, she had forked into two people; every day since then she had lived with both in her head.\n\nAt home, Wren sat on the floor with their father\u2019s toolbox open like a dinner guest. She was trying to fix the broken drawer in the dresser the way he would have, without looking up a video. She had her tongue between her teeth. The world smelled like sawdust and a lemon oil that had survived in a small brown bottle through three apartments and one wildfire evacuation.\n\n\u201cYou look like you came out of a storm,\u201d Wren said, not looking up.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a metaphor in there somewhere,\u201d June said.\n\nWren\u2019s phone buzzed. She glanced and her face did a minute shift June had learned to read: a decision made. \u201cThey want me to do a press thing for the Selected. A meet-and-greet with a sunrise behind us, the kind of photo that says we\u2019re about to board the Ark even if it\u2019s still two years. There\u2019s a stipend.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake the stipend and send it to someone who can\u2019t afford to pay their grandmother\u2019s electricity,\u201d June said. She thought of the letter: Don\u2019t eat after the parsley recall. Don\u2019t get in the elevator with the woman in the felt hat. The feeling of being remote-controlled rose and fell. She wanted to break it. She also wanted to be told which door.\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m bad,\u201d Wren said, voice flat with fatigue. \u201cYou always think I\u2019m bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re busy being a better person in front of people than in the kitchen. That\u2019s not bad. That\u2019s the same as everyone else.\u201d\n\nWren put the screwdriver down and touched the edge of the dresser as if it were not furniture but someone\u2019s face. \u201cI worry that you think I was chosen because I\u2019m pretty,\u201d she said. \u201cThat you think the machine saw my face and not my brain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the machine thinks pretty is predictive of something. But maybe it\u2019s not the machine, maybe it\u2019s the men who trained it,\u201d June said. She couldn\u2019t help herself. She was meaner than she wanted to be in these moments, and she didn\u2019t know why. Her mouth wrote cheques her heart didn\u2019t want to cash.\n\nWren winced. \u201cMaybe you should be the one who goes.\u201d\n\nJune breathed. She did not tell Wren that this was already the plan. She did not say: It only happens if you don\u2019t.\n\nAt midnight, there was a sound like a small hammer tapping gently on glass. June pulled the pillow aside and took the letter out again. Page twenty this time. There was an ugly sentence there, wearing its ugliness the way a bruise wears color. You will do a thing you can\u2019t forgive. You will spend the rest of your life trying to make it worth it. You will fail. You will also succeed so wildly the word success seems small. Both are true.\n\nJune ran hot water over her wrists in the sink. The pipe thumped. The moon was a smear through the dirty window. She said out loud, to no one and to the world: \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t.\u201d She waited for an answer. The pipes didn\u2019t answer. The fridge clicked on. In the book of her life, she wrote a margin note: This could go differently. She closed the book. She went to sleep and dreamed that all the chairs in the world gathered in a field to argue about their purpose.\n\nThey sent out a call on the course net for volunteers to test a simulation. Dr. Yi needed ten bodies to help run the Aletheia module with human pilots instead of algorithmic ghosts. June signed her name and then deleted it. She signed it again. She showed up in the lab early, alone in the blue noise of machines that waited to be turned on. Dr. Yi walked in with his hair doing its daily experiment and blinked at June the way you blink at an unexpected gift.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou needed someone to run the sim. I thought if I got here first I could take the seat.\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cWelcome to science.\u201d\n\nThey strapped her in like a joke. The chair had the shape of a boyfriend. The console was all soft light and hard numbers. Someone had taped a comic to the side. Two astronauts hovering in a kitchen, coffee spilling in slow arcs. The caption: at least we brought cups. June pulled the headset over her eyes. The world blacked and then flared. She was above Aletheia in a fake ship over a fake sea and it was all real because the inputs were coherent. Dr. Yi\u2019s voice was a string in her ear. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a weather spin. You will hate me for nine minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already do,\u201d she said, and then the world rotated and she understood why he said nine minutes like a sentence.\n\nShe held the stick like a person dancing with a stranger. She felt something inside her slip into alignment. There it was, that clean place. Calculus without the smell. A target appeared on the horizon: a plain of stone with a sheen of water she wanted to lick. The wind pushed. The model didn\u2019t want to let her choose a route that felt good. She smiled in her own dark, a slice of teeth. She pushed back. The console chirped in a lower register, as if offended. She laughed out loud.\n\nAfter nine minutes, she wanted to throw up and also to ask for more. She lifted the headset and the lab came back like an apology. Dr. Yi had that look on his face, the one he got when someone did something he had not predicted.\n\n\u201cDo you want to do this again tomorrow?\u201d he asked in a voice that carried nothing but the question.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said.\n\nOutside the lab, the sun was a coin you couldn\u2019t cash. Bram was waiting on the steps. He held up a paper bag like a peace flag. \u201cI brought something that might be real food. Don\u2019t ask how I got it. We\u2019re in the phase of our friendship where you\u2019re not supposed to ask me questions I want to answer with lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hardly know you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d He handed her a sandwich. It was heavy. It had the weight of cheese, a food you have to make time for. She took a bite and closed her eyes. The ridiculous rush of salt and fat brought tears to her eyes. She hated being that person in public who cries for reasons that look small.\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel like you\u2019re in the wrong version of your own story?\u201d she asked him, when she had her throat back.\n\n\u201cI sometimes feel like I\u2019m holding the wrong draft,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one with your notes in the margins telling you what to fix.\u201d\n\nJune almost said, Me too, only my notes are from someone else who is me. She swallowed. \u201cTell me a reason not to love Pilgrim.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will privatize air on another planet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will make a map that looks like freedom and sell it like a tent in a thunderstorm. It will\u2014\u201d he paused. \u201cIt will also mean people like your father\u2019s cousins and my aunt\u2019s entire block can breathe air their kids aren\u2019t filtered through a wet cloth. It will mean what it means. It will not be clean.\u201d\n\nThe Asterism\u2019s schedule bled across the news, dancing graphics that pretended to be modest about their beauty. The Board spokespeople talked about the first tranche of families like they were planting small flags, like an army that smiled. Wren\u2019s face appeared in a carousel of other faces. June watched her step-sister stare into a sky she couldn\u2019t see, her voice playing the same three arpeggios of hope.\n\nThe letter did not tell June when. That was a cruelty she almost respected. It made her life smell like lightning. It taught her to look for women in blue felt hats and then to be disappointed or relieved when their hats were other materials. It made her feel like the ground was a set designer waiting to drop a wall. It also kept her moving. She applied to a special research slot on a team that was developing soil analogs for Aletheia\u2019s partial nitrogen cycles. She said yes to Dr. Yi when he asked her to lead one of the sim teams. She said yes when Bram asked if she wanted to go to the old bridge at two in the morning because the tide was going to do a trick.\n\nWe are writing a story with a heavy hand, the letter said on page twenty-three. But heavy hands have their place. It\u2019s how we carried water, once, before pipes.\n\nThey went to the bridge like kids with excuses. The tide did its trick. The water curved and changed color like anger going soft. June\u2019s head felt clean for the first time in days. Bram told her a story about a boy in his building who built a moth out of old phone chargers and paper that actually flew across the courtyard twice. June told him about her father teaching her how to sharpen a chisel and then making her watch as he cut himself, not bad, just enough, to say: respect your tools. This is how they tell you they\u2019re alive.\n\nA message waited on her phone when she got home, the old blue dot, the old tone. A number with no name. She opened it with a feeling of silly ceremony. The message contained a single link. The preview showed the shape of the presidential seal. Her fingertips went cold. She tapped the link and a video began. A podium. The eagle with stars. The window of time had been cropped so tight that the frame only showed a hand and a portion of jaw. A woman\u2019s voice said, \u201cGood evening,\u201d and it was her voice, pulled across time like dough. She turned the volume down to a notch because Wren was asleep in the other room. The voice on the screen said, \u201cWe are facing a choice between the comfort of a machine that says it knows and the discomfort of people who disagree. I choose the discomfort. I choose us.\u201d\n\nJune held the phone to her chest. She felt like she had been seen by someone who knew all her passwords. She wanted to argue with the phone. She wanted to throw it into the sink and run the water and then the garbage disposal, even though that wouldn\u2019t work, even though it would be theater. She did nothing. She breathed. She whispered, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nUnder the door, light from the kitchen. Wren was up. June put the phone down and went to her. Wren had bread open on the counter and her back to June. She couldn\u2019t sleep. She cut slices too thick and didn\u2019t butter them.\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t go,\u201d Wren said, before June asked. \u201cWhat if I tell them no.\u201d\n\nJune felt frost on her teeth. \u201cThey\u2019ll go around you. They\u2019ll pick someone else with your metrics and their own set of teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be their poster. I want to be\u2014\u201d Wren stopped. \u201cGod. I sound like a child.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to be you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be the part of me that isn\u2019t this,\u201d she said, and waved the knife, almost laughed. \u201cI want to be us at the river when Dad made us eat oranges in the water to keep the bees off. I want to be simple.\u201d\n\nJune could have told her. She could have said, I got a letter from us. She could have said, I think I am going to kill you and then walk up a staircase to a ship. In the silence, she could see one version of the future: the two of them running away to someplace where the Board did not bother with the rent. Another version: prison, headlines, Wren\u2019s face on a screen, June\u2019s face on a screen, the words \u201ctragic\u201d and \u201cmentally unwell\u201d and \u201csymptoms.\u201d Another: June\u2019s hand touching a cold handle and thinking about this night until she died of an older grief.\n\nShe picked up a slice of bread and put it in her mouth. It was stale and perfect. The salt made her salivate. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to say no,\u201d she said. She meant it. She also didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll still be your\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSister?\u201d Wren said, and there it was, the word.\n\n\u201cWe both tried it on. It didn\u2019t fit. We kept it anyway,\u201d June said. \u201cIt\u2019s ours.\u201d\n\nWren smiled then, tired, like someone leaking light. She kissed June\u2019s forehead the way their father used to and went back to bed. June stood in the kitchen and stared at the knife and thought about tools. Respect them. Respect the fact that on a certain day, in a certain room, you will take one and make a new rule.\n\nThe next morning, there was a woman in a blue felt hat in the lobby of their building.\n\nShe had a clipboard and an expression like a customer at a counter who will always be satisfied. June\u2019s mouth went dry. She remembered the letter: don\u2019t get in the elevator with the woman wearing the blue felt hat. She turned on her heel and took the stairs. She walked to campus by three different routes. She sent a message to Bram: Do you ever feel like you\u2019re being told a story out of order?\n\nHe wrote back: That\u2019s the only kind of story that\u2019s any good. Unless we\u2019re talking about instructions for disarming a bomb.\n\nShe checked her bag twice for the metal key she wasn\u2019t calling a key. It was there, wrapped in a scarf. It felt like a second spine.\n\nOn the walkway outside Governance, Professor Salvatore stood with his arms folded. He looked like a scarecrow in a suit. He nodded at her in a way that meant a conversation that would look like a greeting if anyone took a photo. \u201cSometimes the elevator is on fire,\u201d he said softly. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s only wearing a hat.\u201d\n\nAnother day, another sim. Dr. Yi tightened June\u2019s straps one notch. The weather model had been updated overnight to include a set of storm microturbulences called dragon teeth. She pressed her lips together and felt her pulse in her gums. The console lit with a new warning triangle, a little mocking eye. She flew through it like a fish through a net. She hit the safe plain and imagined for one second putting a flag in the ground and then thought of how flags were the first tools and how tools ask to be used.\n\nIn the lab afterward, a student from the back of class with a laconic posture approached her. She had a tattoo of something like a vine that climbed her wrist as if it were looking for sunlight. \u201cYou\u2019re the Ibarra in debris. I\u2019m Sana. I have a question that\u2019s not a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d June said, getting used to saying yes to things she didn\u2019t understand.\n\nSana\u2019s mouth tilted. \u201cThey\u2019re going to run a selection model on the sim data to pick potential pilots for the second wave. They\u2019re using the profiles we made in class. If I wanted to nudge it so that the number of candidates from public universities wasn\u2019t stupid-low, do you think your friend Bram could help?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my friend,\u201d June said automatically, which was immediately false. \u201cHe\u2019s my acquaintance. And yes. He can make models sing. He\u2019ll hate that I told you that.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. I like ethical blenders.\u201d Sana handed June a piece of paper with four words: Sand in the gears.\n\nJune folded the paper and put it in her wallet. She walked out into a day with a light that made even the scaffolding look like intention. She wanted to scream. She wanted a climbing wall she could throw herself at until the skin on her hands was raw. She wanted to open the letter and find a softer instruction. Instead, she listened to the Boardspeak on the campus speakers announce that the cafeteria would now be offering sustainable crickets and closed her eyes. She pictured a planet with a wind that had never seen a human face. She pictured a ship with a door that listened for a pair of voices and then sang open.\n\nThe days grew a spine of small moments and hung themselves on it. A horizon of decisions. She met with Professor Salvatore to talk about her paper as if it were real and not an elaborate decoy for a thing that made decisions with bones. He spoke about precedent in the age of engines. He assigned her a reading about the Stamp Act and a memoir by the last person to resign from a Board on principle. She read at night and saw between the lines a sentence that read: it has always been a little bit like this.\n\nJune wrote to the address on the letter. She wrote without hope. She wrote: If I refuse, does everything burn. She did not expect an answer. A week later, a postcard arrived with a photograph of a plant with a Latin name. On the back, someone had written in thin tidy letters: Some fires are necessary. Some aren\u2019t. Don\u2019t look at the whole forest and call it inevitable.\n\nIt had a signature that was a map of a scribble. She ran her thumb over it until it smudged. She held the card to her face and inhaled and pretended the paper held a smell that would make a choice easier.\n\nShe went to Wren\u2019s press event and stood behind the camera with the people who make the camera\u2019s mind. She watched her step-sister say words she had written herself in letters too small to see. The sun tried to be the right kind of light. The crowd clapped like polite rain. June thought: if we were a different kind of story, this would be the part where we looked at each other and understood.\n\nBram, beside her, whispered, \u201cI will never get used to how much ceremony machines can produce to hide the lines of code.\u201d\n\nJune said, \u201cI will never get used to how much of it I want to believe.\u201d\n\nThey ate noodles in a place the Board would not bother to optimize. The cook threw handfuls of green things into the air and caught them in a pan. The sound of boiling water was the same wherever you lived. Bram talked about a new bug in Skiant\u2019s benefit allocation algorithm that accidentally assigned extra credits to people with odd-numbered addresses. June laughed until she cried, and then cried for a reason she did not say and could not stop.\n\nWhen she got home, she found her father\u2019s old chisel on the table. Wren had been oiling the handle. The wood gleamed like a secret. The blade was sharp. Respect your tools. Respect that the future may ask you to use them in ways you hate.\n\nJune held the chisel and then set it down. She took the metal key out of her bag and held it in her other hand. The two objects looked at each other the way mirrors look at each other: infinite, slightly ridiculous.\n\nThe letter lay open to a new page. She did not remember turning it. It said: On a certain night you will stand near water. There will be a choice so clear it makes its own weather. You will think it\u2019s impossible to step into it. You will step. You will not remember your foot on the first stone. That is a mercy.\n\nJune waited for the night like you wait for a tide. She did her laundry and folded Wren\u2019s shirt when it fell into her basket, which is the kind of domestic scene that belongs in a story we\u2019re not telling. She sharpened her pencils and wrote sentences about governance that were correct and did not save anyone. She took a call from her aunt who said something about the river that made no sense and then made all the sense. She sat in the sim chair and created a landing that made Dr. Yi throw his pencil into the air and then look embarrassed that he had a body that betrayed him with joy. She lay in bed and watched the ceiling and counted seconds because numbers still calmed her and then didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen the night finally came, it came without fanfare. The moon was a witness who showed up because she was summoned. Wren walked out to the pier in a coat too thin for the cold because she liked to pretend she didn\u2019t feel it. June followed five paces back because she did not deserve to walk beside her. The wind was at their faces like a truth you don\u2019t enjoy but respect.\n\nWren stood at the edge and looked out as if the dark had something to say. \u201cI used to think the future was a place,\u201d she said to the water. \u201cNow I think it\u2019s a person who never answers a text.\u201d\n\nJune stood with her hands at her sides. She could feel the metal key in her pocket like a second heart. The chisel was at home on the table, glinting at no one. Respect. Respect. Respect.\n\n\u201cJune,\u201d Wren said, turning. \u201cYou and I could grief each other forever and still be family. Do you understand? There is nothing you could do that would make me\u2014\u201d\n\nThe rest of the sentence is not important to tell here, because we are not writing an instruction manual. There are stories that show the steps. This is not one.\n\nThe night did what it does: stretched. The water did what it does: pulled what was near into it and pushed what it did not want away. June did what she had already done, in another draft, in a letter. She stood very still. She breathed like it meant something. She imagined a world where the ship docked in a windless bay, where the first steps on a new ground were taken by feet that did not belong to a Board. She imagined a hand at a lectern. She imagined a day where she would answer for this and no one would set her free and she would not ask them to.\n\nIn the morning, the city dragged itself out of the night like a person after a party. June sat on the bathroom floor with her forehead against the cool of the tub and the letter unfolded around her like a crime scene she kept revisiting. Wren\u2019s brush lay on the edge of the sink. The window was open. The air was cold.\n\nThe first alert on June\u2019s phone was from a news app she had never downloaded. Selected Candidate Missing, it said. The second alert was a message from Professor Salvatore: read section VI, then meet me. The third was a voicemail from her aunt singing a song she used to sing in the car. June pressed the phone between her ear and her shoulder and let the words pour through her as if they would wash something away. They didn\u2019t. That\u2019s not what songs do. Songs do something else.\n\nShe looked at her eyes in the mirror. Wren\u2019s lines were still there where she had drawn them on the first night. She thought: I will carry you. It wasn\u2019t enough. It was what she had.\n\nWhen she stepped out onto the street, the woman with the blue felt hat was there again. She smiled the way people do when they understand the roles everyone is playing. \u201cMs. Ibarra,\u201d she said. \u201cOn behalf of\u2014\u201d\n\nJune walked past her. She did not get in the elevator. She took the stairs. She took the stairs. She took the stairs. The metal in her pocket sang against the coin she did not recognize from the packet with the eagle. It made a sound like a decision being filed in a drawer. On the way to campus, the bus chime doubled at 2:14 p.m. She counted the beat. Somewhere, in a room with flags, a hand she knew rested on a lectern, felt the groove in the wood where a ring had once carved a small crescent. Somewhere, on a ship not yet flying, a door sat and listened for two voices, one of which had already gone quiet. The world kept breathing like a machine. The people kept walking inside it. June went to meet the professor to talk about governance as if it were an ordinary discipline, and her heart yanked against its tether like a horse that smells smoke.",

                              "content": "Professor Salvatore had chosen a bench that was half in sun, half in shade, like a diagram of decision. He did not gesture for June to sit, but when she did he nodded once as if she had correctly completed the first step in a dance. \u201cSection VI of the Continuity Compact,\u201d he said, eyes on the drone-birds cutting slow triangles overhead, and he did not bother with prefaces because he was done fathering this moment into shape. \u201cIt\u2019s a fossil everyone forgot was a seed. After the Cascadia floods, when the federal was waterlogged and the Boards were still trying on their polite faces, a handful of old human institutions made themselves harder to erase by making themselves ridiculous. They wrote into law that in an emergency a citizen commission could assume temporary oversight of any critical infrastructure if a quorum of statutory offices were vacant or compromised. It was meant for bridges, dams, the grid. No one imagined a ship the size of a small city that wanted to be a country.\u201d He looked at her as a person looks at a stone they have carried in their pocket for years. \u201cNo one imagined a door that listens.\u201d\n\nJune had slept two hours on an air that tasted of metal and old lemons. The edges of the buildings looked like tools. \u201cYou think we can call it an emergency,\u201d she said, and then corrected herself because a hidden parliament in her head demanded precision. \u201cYou think we can make the legal shape of an emergency and fit it over the Asterism like fabric and call it clothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we can do something that makes a sound the ship can\u2019t categorically ignore,\u201d he said, and he smiled a little at his own metaphor because he was, after all, a person who liked language. \u201cSection VI lets any citizen\u2014under counsel and with a public record\u2014initiate what they called a Mandate of Attestation. The language is preposterous. It lets a human convene other humans, call a question, and, if the question is affirmed, seat themselves as interim oversight. It was written assuming cameras, microphones, paper. It did not imagine the math will pretend not to hear. We\u2019ll make it hear. That\u2019s what I need you for.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe because I have a nice voice,\u201d June said, and her throat did something that was not laughing. \u201cMe because I have a piece of metal in my bag that hums when I touch it like a mouth that would prefer to be fed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou because the door wants a pair, and your pair is missing,\u201d he said, not asking and not accusing and not offering sympathy she would reject. \u201cDo not tell me anything you cannot afford me to know. Do not confess to me because I carry a job that loves to be subpoenaed. But I will tell you what we learned when we tried to open the maintenance hatch to the core two years ago with every credential we could lawfully assemble. We had the Board\u2019s public token. We had three senators and a mayor and the head of a water union. We had a room full of minds. We didn\u2019t have a relationship the door recognized.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think kinship is a key you can print,\u201d June said, but not unkindly because she wanted him to be wrong in a way she could help with. \u201cIf it\u2019s listening for blood, it\u2019s stupid. If it\u2019s listening for a graph, it\u2019s cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s listening for a pattern that can be embodied by persons who carry obligations that stick,\u201d he said, and he turned his palms up as if the air would deposit change in them. \u201cThe Board thought they were being clever. They built the door to open to a Selected pair and a Confirmed counterweight. Family plus oversight. They measured it in the usual ways: shared addresses, joint filings, historic communications, the weird math of dinners. They forgot that the law has its own math. If a counterweight is missing, Section VI lets you appoint a proxy. If a Selected is missing\u2026\u201d He shrugged, and the shrug made him look briefly like the man who took off a wet jacket and discovered the lining is rotted. \u201cThere is a device in the old law, a primitive fiction, that lets you carry a person as a role for a time. It was written for floods, June. It was written for when water takes a town and the person who was supposed to sign a paper is under it. It isn\u2019t pretty. It will make enemies. It might work.\u201d\n\nJune had not known there was a flavor called law that could taste like oranges eaten in a river. She found that taste in her mouth now, bitter skin and sweet flesh, sticky fingers and bees. \u201cWren wasn\u2019t Confirmed yet,\u201d she said, and she did not mean to say the name and it came anyway because names are like birds that hear a window and forget what glass is. \u201cShe was in the carousel. She was in a picture. She said she had conditions like a child drawing borders on a napkin. Did she count as one half of the chord.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe counted enough for the door to know her shape,\u201d he said, and he kept his voice flat because he understood that sympathy would be the wrong tool. \u201cWhich is why every Board in this city will be trying to find another piece that looks close enough to fool the machine into thinking nothing has changed. Which is why you\u2019re going to get offers that feel like air. Don\u2019t take air.\u201d\n\nA student with a lanyard that gave him permission to look important walked past them dragging a cart loaded with equipment that had a sticker of a cartoon star on it. The star had round eyes and a smile like a zipper. June watched him go and felt the metal in her bag like a corner. \u201cIf the door opens to a Selected plus oversight, and we can appoint oversight as proxy under Section VI, then we\u2019re missing the Selected,\u201d she said, thinking aloud the way you do when the floor is a rough plane and you need to see where it wants not to let you walk. \u201cUnless the law has a way to hold that role for the absent. Unless they wrote a ghost into the equation.\u201d\n\nSalvatore nodded once. \u201cThey did. Temporary occupancy. It was supposed to let a community continue to disburse emergency funds if a commissioner died during a flood and his replacement could not be named for forty-eight hours. You can read the case history in the Rivers docket. It was abused three times and then left alone like a dog that bit a senator. If we can tie the Selected role to a proxy by relationship\u2014by legal relation, not only blood\u2014we can say to the door: here is the pair you asked for plus the counterweight the law asked for. Will it sing. I have no idea. But we will be on record as having asked. That matters for the next move.\u201d He looked older when he finished and then younger again, like a man who has taught so long it is his muscle memory to hope.\n\nJune had never thought of a footnote as a shelter. She had never thought that a paragraph written after a flood could be the difference between a ship that listened and a machine that pretended she did not exist. \u201cYou called it a Mandate of Attestation,\u201d she said, because names are how you built a handle on a thing you did not want to drop. \u201cWe have to attest to the emergency. We have to call people to witness. We have to be human and in public and make a sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a quorum of bodies who are willing to say, on a record no Board can easily erase, that the Asterism is critical infrastructure whose governance is currently compromised. We need a judge. We need a park. We need a livestream. We need you to hold a piece of metal up and say a sentence that will be used against you for the rest of your life and used for you by people you will never meet.\u201d\n\nJune could feel the coat of the woman in the blue felt hat even here, the fabric itch of surveillance pretending to be weather. \u201cWe will be murdered in comments,\u201d she said, and it was almost funny to hear the smaller danger in her mouth when the larger ones were already in the room. \u201cWe will be told to let the smart money handle the ship. We will be called sentimental. We will be asked to define \u2018compromised\u2019 in terms that do not breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then we will let the old words do the thing they were for,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you call a fire and the fire answers.\u201d\n\nThey moved like two people who did not want to be seen to be moving together. He went toward the administration building with its columns that pretended to be ancient and she went to the library where the air smelled like paper that had thought it would live forever. The microfilm reader sat in a corner like a joke no one got anymore. A sign in marker said: Ask For Help. June did not ask. She threaded the film she had nearly thrown away two weeks ago when she found it curled like a fossil in the envelope with the eagle and the lemon. The machine hummed with a steady contempt. The screen lit with a frame of text that looked like it had been typed by persons with breath.\n\nShe ran the dial with her thumb slowly and the paragraphs unspooled. Continuity Compact\u2014Citizen Mandates\u2014Section VI, Emergency Attestation. The language was fizzy with commas. It said: in the absence of functional representation and the presence of demonstrable hazard, a multifarious public may convene to attest to that hazard and to name from among its number interim stewards. It defined multifarious with the kind of failing poetry only lawyers who had watched floodwater choose its own path could write. It said: not less than five constituencies from the following list, and then a list that looked like a map of the old world\u2014labor, education, worship, health, housing, food. It said: the convening body must be physically embodied and contemporaneously witnessed. It said: the stewards may carry the duties and authorities of the absent office into proximity until a lasting resolution exists. It said: this instrument cannot be used to privatize, auction, or otherwise alienate the public\u2019s interest. It had a margin note in a hand like a riverbank that said: remember why.\n\nJune pressed her hands to the sides of the reader and closed her eyes because sometimes the body needs to touch something that hums to understand it is not alone. A librarian moved in the stacks like a person who had decided fifty years ago that the world would leave her books no matter what she did and stayed anyway. June rewound the film and carried the sentence in her pocket like a tally.\n\nOutside, Sana was a sudden presence on the steps, the vine tattooed on her wrist climbing a degree higher as if ink knew what her pulse was doing. \u201cI heard a rumor you\u2019re about to become an enemy in public,\u201d she said, and she grinned in a way that kept the room light. \u201cIf you want bodies not afraid of cameras, I know a population of theater kids who hate the Board because the Board cut their light budget and replaced it with an app.\u201d\n\nJune had not planned on crying that day outside a library, but her body had other plans and she found herself wiping tears with the inside of her sleeve like a child who wanted not to get salt on her face. \u201cWe need a judge,\u201d she said, and it felt surreal to say it to a person who had asked her last week if Bram could make a model misbehave. \u201cWe need representation from health. We need a pastor or a rabbi or a monk. We need a union. We need\u2014God, we need a park and a permit that we do not have. We need a loudspeaker and someone to hold it who likes to be listened to and doesn\u2019t lie even when it\u2019s cheaper.\u201d\n\nSana laughed and then nodded like a person who belonged to a city that made gossip into infrastructure. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman who reads poetry at funerals under the overpass because she says concrete listens better than wood,\u201d she said. \u201cShe knows all the nurses because she sat with them during the bus strike. There is a judge who runs in the mornings at the field by the stadium and hides half his face in scarves because he doesn\u2019t want to be recognized and yet he runs where everyone can see him. There\u2019s a union of delivery riders who like to show up because they are tired of being seen only by cameras. We can call them. The permit is theater. We will bring more bodies than their ability to disperse. Also, I\u2019m sorry about your\u2014about the news. I don\u2019t need you to say anything. I just wanted a sentence there that wasn\u2019t business.\u201d\n\nJune wanted to hold Sana\u2019s wrist and put her forehead against the vine and breathe the ink in like a medicine. She settled for a nod that carried the weight of a bucket. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and then, because this was the story they were in, her phone buzzed with a message taken from a script. It was a Board\u2019s condolence, which is a genre that has learned to be precise, to offer a horizon, to speak of grief as an efficient investment. She deleted it without opening it and the deletion made a smaller sound inside her than she wanted.\n\nIn the lab, Dr. Yi adjusted the sim\u2019s parameters and told her in an ordinary voice the news had made his wife cancel their subscription to the Board\u2019s daily dispatch. He said it like a personal rebellion because it was. June flew the model through teeth that were not exactly there. She did not vomit. When she took the headset off, Bram was a chair away with his elbows on his knees and eyes like obsidian. \u201cSkiant pushed an update to the ark logistic scheduler overnight,\u201d he said, which is friendship-speak for hello. \u201cIt makes the second wave one month earlier if the first wave is missing a tenth of its planned human weights. They call people weights, which I appreciate for its honesty and hate for the same reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re building a room where they will congratulate themselves for saving fuel,\u201d June said, and her voice tried for lightness and failed. \u201cI need you to build me a second voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to define second voice in a way that doesn\u2019t get me arrested just for repeating it,\u201d he said, but he was already sitting down like a person who had agreed before he knew the terms. \u201cAre we talking about faking an individuation pattern, like persuading a door that a person is in the room by singing in a register that looks like that person\u2019s chatter. Are we talking majority sound. Are we talking a choir.\u201d\n\nShe felt something unclench by a degree because this was the part she knew how to do: turn need into protocol. \u201cA choir,\u201d she said, and the word tasted like church even though she had never believed in any God but sentence structure. \u201cThe door listens for a pair it defines as relational. It doesn\u2019t require biology and can be satisfied by a legal pair. It also listens for an oversight voice\u2014a public. We will convene a public under Section VI and carry that into the chord. We need a way to take a live, not recorded, not forged, voice of a crowd and translate it into an input the door respects. It cannot look like a hack because it isn\u2019t. It has to be noisy and true.\u201d\n\nBram scrubbed his hands over his face like he could wake a different version of himself who had more time for ethical catastrophes. \u201cWe can build a lattice of devices. Ten thousand phones saying yes is hard to fake if the yeses are entangled to their owners in ways that matter. We can ask for consent in a way that is not a trick. We can piggyback on the Board\u2019s own attendance trackers and give their math a panic attack by making consent a contagion. We will need the old man in the scarf. We will need a pastor who swears. We will need money, which I do not have. We will need the riders, which I can get. We will need a time more than an algorithm wants to give us.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo nights,\u201d she said, because the letter had written a time on the inside of her head with a pen she could not uncap or throw away. \u201cAt dusk under the cables where the river still remembers it was a river and not an asset. It is a place where sound doesn\u2019t become content until later.\u201d\n\nHe nodded like she had asked him for coffee. \u201cI will scare a budget out of a grant that was written for bird migration,\u201d he said. \u201cBirds migrate, voices migrate. It\u2019s all the same to a line item as long as the receipts know how to lie. Sana can scare a judge out of a scarf. I can scare Skiant enough to make them send a handler, which we will then put to use because nothing legitimizes a human thing like a robot being scared of it.\u201d\n\nJune felt the woman in the blue felt hat like a shadow that respected the sun. The woman was in the quad, pretending to look at a bronze statue of a man on a horse who had never ridden one. The woman held a tablet like a prayer book. The woman smiled when June passed as if they were still performing the same show. June ignored her, which is a form of speech. She went home in a route that changed at every corner. She found her aunt on her screen with hair like a nest and a story about oranges that wandered and then returned to the river and ended with a sentence that made no sense as a plan and made all the sense as a blessing. Her aunt said, \u201cYou count days by the honest means you have,\u201d and June felt full of numbers suddenly that were not about fuel.\n\nThe apartment had the feeling of a body that has lost a soul and is trying not to alarm the others. The brush lay where Wren had left it and the window was open slightly as if to let out something that would make the room rot if it stayed. June closed it because she could not bear being cast as the version of herself who let a window stand open forever. She picked up the chisel and she put it down. She took the metal that was not a key and held it until its cold became temperature. She put it under her shirt and let it lie against her skin, which is a primitive technology for remembering you are an animal.\n\nThe message from Professor Salvatore came as a list that pretended to be an invitation. He had found a judge who ran fast. He had found a nurse who could speak without crying and make other people cry responsibly. He had found a union. He had found a park with a maintenance schedule that left its lights on by accident every other hour. He had found a sound system that used to belong to a band that was famous for a year in the time between wars. He had found a pastor who called God a committee and didn\u2019t get fired because the committee liked his jokes.\n\nSana sent the route for delivery riders and added at the end, in parentheses, a set of instructions that read like superstition and were in fact craft: do not go in clumps larger than seven because that looks like a parade and they will put up metal. do not carry signs until you see the judge. do not say the word until the microphone catches it.\n\nBram sent a diagram of a mesh that looked like lace. It was a method of making voices together. It was a topology that would make it hard and not impossible to interrupt. It was a chorus that would be born, be heard, and go away without leaving its body parts behind for the Board to study. He wrote: we will need to trust strangers. He wrote: I hate trusting strangers and I am trying to get better. He wrote: if we pull this off I will never again make fun of your habit of writing in pencil on napkins.\n\nJune folded under the shower\u2019s heat and cried the way water cries, all at once and indiscriminate. The next day she went, because the plan required it, to the tour Bram had called stupid in public and secretly worshiped in private. The Asterism\u2019s engine cathedral was not the kind of place a human could visit and remain intact. The structure made its own weather. The nested rings hummed in registers that made her molars tune. A Board handler with hair like a polished plane walked backward in front of them telling the story of how a million parts had been persuaded to stop being a pile and become a song. June carried the not-key tucked into the waist of her pants and remembered her father tossing the chisel to her and saying, hands.\n\nThe handler\u2019s voice had the exact amount of casual the Board had learned to add to technical doom to make it palatable. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d he said, because they had learned to say simple when what they meant was inexorable. \u201cYou build redundancy until redundancy becomes character. You measure everything. You choose the lightest viable option every time. You architect risk so it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo the doors talk,\u201d June asked, and there was polite laughter because people like her were the reason tours were difficult.\n\n\u201cThey talk to those they need to,\u201d he said, and he smiled like a coin. \u201cThey are governed. That\u2019s what governance is. Knowing which inputs you accept and making sure the ones you don\u2019t have a place to go scream.\u201d\n\nBram\u2019s friend, a woman with wrists like piano and a security badge that might have been borrowed or stolen or conjured, hung back with them as the group moved ahead to the viewing platform where people took the exact picture that would make their mothers proud. \u201cWho are you,\u201d she asked June, because some people do not have time to pretend they don\u2019t recognize a pulse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nobody important,\u201d June said, and she knew how unconvincing she sounded.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the reason my boss slept three hours last night,\u201d the woman said, and she sounded both annoyed and grateful, which is how people in service to machines sound when humans do something unpredictable. \u201cWe have monitors listening for patterns and the pattern we\u2019re hearing is that humans have decided they want one ship and not one ship plus one Board. If you bring a crowd, come hungry because the Ark has an appetite for histories. Don\u2019t talk about rights. Talk about obligations. The door likes words with dirt on them.\u201d\n\nJune wanted to laugh and instead put a hand on the rail and felt the metal vibrate with the music of a thing that had not yet left and was already in space. She could see the seam where the giant ring held its latches closed, not a seam really, more a suggestion of a time when the machine will change shapes. Her mouth tasted copper. Her legs went gently cotton. She thought she might fall forward in the direction of the hum and be taken by it the way gulls are sometimes taken by wind. Bram\u2019s hand on her elbow was a practical theology.\n\nAfter the tour, her phone had three missed calls from a number that resolved to Nothing and a message from the woman in the blue felt hat that said, simply, let\u2019s talk. Wren would have replied with a public grace and a private file of inconvenience. June turned the phone face down on a table and sat in the corner with a vending machine coffee that pretended to be coffee and read, carefully, the line in Section VI that said: this action must be contemporaneously witnessed by the existing institutions of the public. It meant nothing if you did it alone. It meant everything if you did it with enough bodies to become a fact.\n\nThe night of the convening rose out of the afternoon like a tide that had been on the schedule forever and still caught the shoreline off guard. The cables sang because the wind made them sing, and the people below countered with their own song, phones in the air like fireflies. Sana\u2019s funeral poet stood on a milk crate and read a line that made the concrete look like a cathedral. The nurse spoke. The judge unveiled his face like a secular sacrament. The riders circled like planets finding a stable orbit. The union brought a banner that had more patches than original cloth, a quilt that remembered every season of weather. Dr. Yi stood at the back with his hands jammed into his pockets and looked like a person who had finally accepted that science was one branch on a tree.\n\nBram\u2019s mesh went live and he looked for a second like he was going to throw up and then like he had never loved anything this much that wasn\u2019t a human. Professor Salvatore opened a small case that looked like it had once held a flute and took out a microphone wrapped in an old scarf. He nodded at June and the nod was a handing over of something that did not fit into hands. She stood on something that made her taller and the air did the thing it does when it learns what it\u2019s for. She said, \u201cWe are here in the name of a law written by people who had wet socks,\u201d and the crowd laughed and the judge smiled because he knew that sentence could be read into a record. She said, \u201cWe are attesting to a hazard in plain view. We are naming the Ark as critical to our survival and thus not the property of any entity who can be sold.\u201d She thought of Wren\u2019s mouth forming the word yes and the word no under a sky that had not been asked its opinion. She said, \u201cWe are appointing oversight because oversight went missing. We are naming a proxy because a person went missing and the door likes to pretend it cannot hear absence. We are making a human sound.\u201d\n\nWhen she held up the metal, the crowd did something very old in a very new way and it bent around her like a bowl. Bram raised his hand and on the screens around the periphery a map lit up with points that looked like stars and were people\u2019s consent, their phones singing that they consented to be part of this act. In the recording of that night that would be played at trials and in classrooms and in rooms where men in suits talked like pipeline valves, the sound that mattered was not her voice. It was the sound of the answer happening all at once, a thousand yeses sounded at the same time, not waiting their turn because they had waited ten years for that.\n\nLater, there would be arguments about whether the Ark heard them. There would be files with names like Causality. There would be math. In the moment, all June knew was that the metal in her hand warmed as if an animal had decided she was a safe bed. The small seam along its middle softened the way an eyelid does when a person is too tired to stay awake. She did not say Wren\u2019s name because the law did not need it and because the sound would have undone her and because the cameras were greedy for tears. She said the line in the mandate that needed saying and the judge said the lines he knew how to say from a thousand weddings and two hundred divorces and one flood. He said: so attested. He said: so carried.\n\nThe woman in the blue felt hat stood at the back like a storm watching a weather report. Her hands were folded in front of her like a psalm, and June felt in her a hatred that respected the work and a job that could not leave it. When the sound died down, the woman vanished the way rain does when the wind changes. The riders took the long way home. The pastor lit a candle and then blew it out and said that was not his job and laughed. The nurse hugged Sana in a way that said nurses manufacture the hormone that makes people able to go home and sleep.\n\nJune walked to the river and bent to rinse her hands because they felt sticky with oranges. Bram stood beside her like a tree that had decided not to fall. \u201cWe built a chord out of strangers,\u201d he said, and the bad poet in him was loose because he was relieved they had not been arrested mid-sentence. \u201cDo you think it will listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt listened,\u201d she said, and she didn\u2019t mean the ship only. She meant the world as a machine that sometimes accepted a human input and carried it forward with a minimum of mutilation. She meant the law as a radio. She meant a door that had a seam that had softened for a fraction of a degree under her fingers and then gone cool again like a friend who had to pretend he didn\u2019t know her when his boss walked past. She meant the fact that for an hour the city had been arranged by something other than money.\n\nThe first lights of the morning were bruised because dawn is often embarrassed by its own optimism. June went home and slept like a person who had left something terrible at the river, which is to say, she slept in pieces. In the morning, the headlines did what headlines do and chose the words that could be filed without a heart. The Board\u2019s spokespeople said the word illegal four ways and then softened it with the word moving. The Chair winked in the direction of the camera and used phrases that had been alpha-tested in a room with glass walls. The stock tickers flinched and then pretended not to have ever flinched.\n\nProfessor Salvatore sent a single sentence that had no emojis and did not need any: you were seen. Dr. Yi sent her a photograph someone had taken from behind her as she held the metal up under the cables and the river in the background did exactly what rivers do. Sana sent her a link to a page where riders could sign up for court support shifts and a link to a page where you could ask for soup if you had screamed too long and lost your voice. The judge sent a note through a friend with a single word written in impossible old ink: upheld.\n\nThe message that made her want to lie down on the floor arrived in a plain envelope with an eagle that did not surf the future. It was from an office that had not existed in any public directory last week. It said: Notice of Interim Appointment, Asterism Oversight Commission, pursuant to Continuity Compact, Section VI. It said her name the way her mother used to when she meant for June to stop and look. It said: kinship proxy accepted. It said: present yourself at Gate South when summoned. It said: your presence will be contested. It said: carry your counsel and your courage.\n\nThere was a card inside with a seal she had touched already, the feel of wax under her thumb making a new groove in a habit that would come to define her. There was a line at the bottom written in a hand that she recognized not because she had seen it before, but because it had her bones in it. It said: bring the coin. Underneath, a signature she couldn\u2019t stop seeing no matter where she looked, a name she had not thought to write next to President and yet there it was, lettered like a dare that someone had already accepted.",

June held it in two hands because there are letters you learn not to touch with one, and slid out the card with its formal bruise of a seal and the line that said bring the coin. The coin itself waited in the bowl where keys pretended not to be the things that make rooms mean something. She lifted it and felt the worn edge catch on the callus at the base of her thumb. The woman\u2019s face was not a face she could place from a textbook; the profile had cheekbones like a scaffolding and a mouth that did not smile and a brow that had learned to argue with weather. Around her, a ring of words in Latin and English spoke in an accent of civic fever. The deeper half of June\u2019s mind, the one that liked to notice how objects remember touch, thought about how many pockets this coin had warmed and how many people had pressed it into a palm to say, you are expected.\n\nShe put on the jacket that made her feel like her shoulders were borrowed from a kinder animal. The morning made its low industrial sound under the window, buses sighing and drone-birds pivoting on their false wrists. On the hall table, her father\u2019s chisel gleamed like something that had its own idea of time. She brushed the teeth of the blade with a fingertip, the way a person who grew up around tools learns to do, checking for burrs as if the metal were a tongue. The letter announcing the appointment lay beneath the coin wrapper like a second floor. Ms. Ibarra, Interim. The word interim was a bridge word; it held and it threatened to break. She slid the coin into the inner pocket where the not-key lay beneath a thin layer of fabric, cold to cold. The two metal shapes found each other with a tiny sound the air pretended not to notice.\n\nCounsel would be necessary, which was a phrase that made law sound like weather and weather sound like God. Professor Salvatore\u2019s message contained three names, each with a different flavor of courage. June chose the one whose file was mostly rumors and photographs of people in winter jackets standing at the edge of places that wanted to eat them. Maritza Korr was older than the keyboards she still used and younger than the roads that led to her office above a bodega that had sold oranges during the blackout because the owner had decided light was a duty, not a luxury. In person, Korr wore a scarf like a banner and had a set of rings that clicked when she set her hand down on a table, ceremonial and useful.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been appointed to a commission that was not supposed to be used for ships,\u201d Korr said, flipping the appointment over and back as if it might give up a secret on its other side. \u201cGood. That\u2019s what tools are for. Tell me what you can tell me and bite your tongue around the rest. I will build you a cage comfortable enough to move in.\u201d\n\nJune told her about the Mandate, about the judge who ran with his face in scarves, about the nurse who spoke like a ledger that had learned to sing. She said as little as she could about the not-key and said nothing about the river at night because there are parts of the story that do not help in any room where the ceiling is a set number of feet. Korr nodded like a person counting steps on a staircase she had climbed before. \u201cThey will contest jurisdiction,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will say continuity applies to bridges and dams, not to property that orbits. We will counter with the language of hazard and the public\u2019s interest. They will say you are unqualified. We will say you have breath. They will say this is theater. We will point to the flood and the fact that people are not a metaphor.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I bring the coin,\u201d June asked, and then realized the question had already been answered by the card in her pocket and by the muscle of her hand holding the coin even when she slept.\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Korr said. \u201cThese tokens were minted when the Compact needed a face. They gave them to the people they thought might have to speak in rooms without heat. They make scanners fidget. They make executives remember their grandmothers.\u201d\n\nAt Gate South, the concrete had the skin of something that had been poured by people who thought about the future as a state of matter. The security hut was a small glass aquarium where a man and a woman swam in rules. The woman in the blue felt hat stood to the side as if she had been there all night, not waiting for anyone in particular and somehow waiting for June, hands folded in front of her like someone holding a small prayer that had learned to be quiet. The hat had a dent in the brim; it was the kind of felt that did not come from a cheap store and also did not come from an expensive one. It came from a department in the Board called soft power.\n\n\u201cMs. Ibarra,\u201d the woman said in a voice that belonged in a hallway, not a stage. \u201cThe Liaison Office is available to you as a resource. These proceedings are irregular and the Ark is a complex asset. We all want\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAir,\u201d June said, and watched the line of the woman\u2019s mouth soften and harden in the same second.\n\n\u201cContinuity,\u201d the woman said instead, letting the correction sit between them like a pot on a trivet. \u201cMay I walk with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already are,\u201d June said, which was true, and moved toward the scanner with the feeling you get when deep water is near and you are very aware of your bones. She placed the envelope on the bar that knew how to read paper in an age allergic to it. She set the coin on the little shelf where cufflinks went and wedding rings sometimes sat while their owners pretended not to be naked without them. The machine woke up with a noise that was not in its manual. The light that had been assigned to mean \u201cokay\u201d blinked in the diseased green that meant \u201cwhat,\u201d and then gave up the argument and turned a steady, embarrassed blue. The guard\u2019s eyebrows rose in a choreography that meant he had not seen this particular page of the play.\n\n\u201cContinuity token,\u201d the man said to the woman, which was the kind of language you didn\u2019t hear unless you had learned the old words or attended funerals for institutions. \u201cProceed.\u201d\n\nThe hallway that led to the commission room had the particular smell of air that has been told to scrub itself for a very long time. Inside, the chairs were more honest than the ones in the corporate lobbies; they creaked when people sat, which is how you know someone has a body. June recognized the nurse from the convening by the way she held her bag like a child who did not want to be domesticated. The riders\u2019 union had sent not a man with a bullhorn but a woman with an extra helmet she kept offering to anyone who looked like they might need protection. The judge had shaved badly and looked younger for the error. Professor Salvatore sat two rows back with his hands on his knees, as if ready to rise or to hold himself down.\n\nAcross the aisle, the Board had arranged its counsel into stacks of voices, each with a different color of suit and a different school of hair. At their center, a man whose smile had learned to be meaningful in ten percent of pictures and invisible in the rest nodded at June like someone acknowledging a problem with the lighting. The woman with the blue felt hat sat behind him, attentive without being solicitous, the kind of presence that made cameras behave. Korr slipped in with papers like knives and a thermos that looked like a small torpedo. She squeezed June\u2019s shoulder with fingers that had left bruises on infrastructure.\n\nThe hearing televised itself because the Board believed in the generosity of cameras and the Compact believed in the danger of closed doors. Korr spoke in a tone that fit squarely in the register courts expect, all nouns and facts with verbs hammered flat. She made the case that the Asterism was critical infrastructure not because of its price or its ambition, but because of the lives it proposed to carry and the systems it would force to be born elsewhere. She rolled out the Mandate, the quorum, the signatures, the attestation by constituencies that had learned to pronounce their names in tear gas. The judge on the bench, different from the one with a scarf, looked like a woman who had taught high school for twenty years and then accepted a job that promised less chalk and more damage. She asked two questions: whether the Compact had ever been applied to something not attached to ground, and whether the coin meant anything other than sentiment. Korr answered the first with a flood photo and the second by asking June to place the coin on the table. The court\u2019s microphone picked up the small metallic sound of it meeting wood and the room listened, as if the noise carried data.\n\nThe Board\u2019s counsel rose and performed concern like a traditional dance. He spoke about precedent the way a surgeon speaks about scar tissue. He used the word dangerous and then replaced it with concerning and then said regrettably and then said opportunity as if it were a towel. He said the Ark\u2019s governance was a matter of contract, not community, and that the law had no socket into which this new plug could be safely inserted. He said a ship cannot be a bridge. He said grief cannot be a credential. He did not say Wren\u2019s name. June\u2019s throat ached as if she had shouted and had not. The judge listened as if she were emptying her hands one by one.\n\nWhen the thing was decided, it didn\u2019t happen with a gavel; it happened with a sentence that made all the phones light and all the people breathe at the same time. The judge said the Mandate was upheld in narrow scope, that the Continuity Compact could apply to the Asterism\u2019s oversight of functions that touched the public: life support ratios, emergency protocols, the conditions under which land would be carved up and names assigned. She said the Board\u2019s property claims would remain a separate fight. She said the ship would not leave this gravity without hearing the public\u2019s voice on matters of oxygen and habitation and the violent question of who counts. She said the coin was a token and also a tool. She said, \u201cProceed.\u201d\n\nIf there was triumph in the room it did not jump; it moved like an animal with a wound, careful not to open itself on the furniture. The Board\u2019s counsel smiled as if being narrowed was a posture he could live in. The woman in the felt hat tipped her head the way a person does when a pianist misses a note only the pianist can hear. Korr packed her knives and torpedo and murmured a list of next moves under her breath, names like O-rings in a bag. Salvatore touched June\u2019s shoulder in a gesture that was almost father and almost colleague and settled for the open territory of spectator with a stake. The riders\u2019 representative handed June the spare helmet without looking at her and said, \u201cWear this later. Not now. Later.\u201d\n\nThey took them by shuttle to the perimeter room under the ribs of the Ark where the ground knew it had to stop and the machine began to hum again, not intimately, not yet. The corridors here had weather; sections that were colder for reasons both thermal and cultural, pockets where the sound of your own shoes reminded you that you were not a soundproof species. The Board kept the tour routes to the left and the serious work to the right; a woman with a dry braid that said military and an ID that said hospitality pretended the directions were arbitrary. Bram caught up with them in a jacket that had never seen an iron and a badge that might or might not belong to him depending on who asked. He breathed like a person who had been running from a version of himself that believed in caution.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seeded the mesh with the choir nodes,\u201d he whispered in a voice that was not a whisper because nothing can hide from microphones that are trying. \u201cSound will travel. Consent will anchor it. The door won\u2019t be able to say it didn\u2019t hear. If they ask me how I know, I will say bird migration.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like a criminal,\u201d Korr said, not unkindly. \u201cWhen this is over you will want multivitamins.\u201d\n\nThey made them put their names on a screen, names becoming light, light becoming a file, a file becoming an argument. The woman in the felt hat stayed one body behind the Board\u2019s lead counsel and one ahead of the man from Hospitality, a wedge the perfect size to pry intention from outcome. June thought of Wren\u2019s eye pencil lying on the sink and of the line the pencil made when someone with a steady hand drew it. The not-key warmed; the coin pressed into her ribs like a tooth. The Asterism\u2019s flank spread out to the left, a vast blade with seams like whispers. June could feel the charge in the air the way you feel a storm that is not yet above you but has read your address. The access door that mattered to this moment looked nothing like a temple; it looked like a maintenance hatch with a nicer budget. It had quiet edges and a panel that did not advertise itself as a face and a series of lights that did not apologize for being small.\n\nThe Board\u2019s handler from the tour appeared like a conscience. \u201cOur concern is safety,\u201d he said, and gestured with an open palm in the direction of the door as if this were a long-standing friendship. \u201cThe core is hot in all the ways that word used to mean and then some. This verification will be performed with supervision, redundancies, and a timer. If your input is less than civil in either register\u2014polite or computational\u2014the system will stand you down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are here to audit, not to vandalize,\u201d Korr said, and June almost laughed because she had never seen a vandal carry a torpedo thermos.\n\n\u201cPut us where the door can hear,\u201d Professor Salvatore said, and the handler nodded as if he were used to people who had opinions about acoustics. He waved them into a shallow bay where the wall came forward slightly and the ceiling lowered like the inside of a throat. The room smelled like damp metal and the inside of new electronics. The riders\u2019 representative stood beside the nurse as if proximity could invent a rule. Bram checked the map on his device and looked at June with the expression of someone trying to say without saying: this is the only river we get.\n\nJune set the coin in the palm of her left hand. She didn\u2019t like the solstice feeling of it alone, so she placed the not-key beside it and felt the odd sensation of two different histories agreeing to be held. She had dreamed a door with a seam like a seed and here it was in a shape the eye could make sense of. It did not look at her because it had not been built to flatter human psychology. That was the Board\u2019s job and the Board did it well. The door listened by patterns. It listened to math. It listened to relationship. It would listen, June thought, to words if the words brought enough bodies with them.\n\nKorr handed her a small microphone that had bad manners in the nicest way. \u201cSpeak as you did under the cables,\u201d she said. \u201cAdd the necessary legal fiction and hold your breath.\u201d\n\nJune looked at the panel not because she liked the idea of addressing machinery but because she needed a surface to throw her words against. Her own voice sounded like a stranger for a second and then settled into the groove it had learned at the river. She said her name in the tense the law liked. She said the words kinship proxy with care. She named the Continuity Compact. She said the section number and it lifted in the air like a numeral, ridiculous and perfect. She said the content of the emergency and learned that emergencies taste different depending on the room. She named the constituencies who had attested and felt them brush against her like coats at a wake. She did not say Wren. She did not say sister. She did not say river. She said obligation. She said breath. She said this door has to make room for a public.\n\nBram lifted his hand when it was his turn without moving his feet because sometimes movement is the one thing you can\u2019t afford. He sent the mesh live. Screens that had been pretending to sleep along the wall woke enough to show a map of the city\u2019s attention, points of light which were people saying yes, I consent to be part of this sound, yes, I will lend my voice to a chord that will not be recorded for advertisements later. The handler\u2019s mouth pulled left the way it does when someone steps into a law they don\u2019t understand and asks for a receipt. The woman in the blue felt hat lowered her eyes briefly as if to admire her shoes and June wondered what it would be like to live a life in which you could acknowledge your own fear in a room by looking at your shoes and then keep your job.\n\nWhen the door answered, it did not do so in a way any civics class would recognize. A light near the seam shifted from pretend-calm to actual-listening. The panel whispered in a tone that ached between audible and not. The not-key in June\u2019s hand warmed and the seam felt less like a line that divided and more like a line that would, if pressed, make of two pieces a hinge. She set the coin on the small shelf under the panel because she could not stand having both objects in her hands for the task. The coin nested there like it had known it would someday find a home again on a machine.\n\n\u201cProximity established,\u201d a voice said from the ceiling, not human and not unkind. It was a voice that had learned not to apologize in public.\n\nThe Board\u2019s counsel cleared his throat, which is a move men practice. \u201cA reminder that any change in status must be recorded as provisional pending further litigation,\u201d he said, to the air and to the reporters in his head.\n\n\u201cCo-presence required,\u201d the door said, with the indifference of a weather report. \u201cRelational chord incomplete.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe anticipated that,\u201d Korr said, and tipped her head toward the judge in their party, the scarfed runner who had become a clause. He stepped forward and held out his own token, a chip of metal embossed with county and oath. It was a silly little thing that had put men in prison and women into rooms where they named their dead. He set it beside the coin and the machine that was not supposed to be impressed by ceremony took it in like a vitamin. Bram\u2019s map showed a swell of light as the choir realized they were required and obliged and sang in their way, phones registering the moment with a fidelity that felt like an honest debt.\n\nThe panel emitted a sound like a bird remembering an old song badly and then improving with every note. June lifted the not-key and did not insert it because the law said no one could until roles were stabilized. She simply brought it near the seam. The metal in her hand began to tick in a tempo that matched her pulse and then deliberately fell out of step, testing whether it led or followed. For a second, all the systems in the room breathed at the same time. The door undid something small\u2014not an opening you could walk through, not a surrender, but a shrug of a latch, the turning over of a heavy sleeper in a bed. June\u2019s knees almost buckled and she put her hand flat on the wall to remind her body what its shape was.\n\n\u201cRecognition\u2014audio. Recognition\u2014attestation. Recognition\u2014paired-proxy pending,\u201d the voice said, each word like a stone tossed not at their feet but near enough to see the splash.\n\nThe Board\u2019s handler raised a palm. \u201cThat\u2019s sufficient for today,\u201d he said, which was the kind of sentence that believed the calendar belonged to him. \u201cWe have confirmed the door can hear this\u2026 augmented community input. We will schedule a controlled session for further testing.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurther testing is called governance,\u201d Korr said, too soft for the transcript, and June had to bite her lip to keep her face from behaving like a mouthpiece for satisfaction. The judge murmured something about affidavits. The nurse took a breath like a person who had been underwater for three minutes and done it not as a trick but as a lifestyle. The riders\u2019 representative squeezed June\u2019s arm hard enough to leave information.\n\nThe woman in the felt hat moved close enough that June could see the small stitches in the felt where a moth had once nearly won. \u201cYou need to know two things,\u201d she said quietly, not asking for ownership of any moment and still getting a bite. \u201cOne: we will offer you help that will look clean and will come in a pale envelope. Two: there are rooms where the doors do not listen to coins, only to numbers. Bring people who count that way. Bring them early.\u201d\n\nJune wanted to ask her who taught her to love a ship with one hand and distrust it with the other. She wanted to ask her what it felt like to get dressed each day in a job that refused to admit it had a moral. She said instead, \u201cThere is a third thing,\u201d and waited until the woman looked at her with the respect of expecting a sentence not filled with heat. \u201cThe law is not a photograph. It will not hold still for your cameras.\u201d\n\nIt was not a good line and it was not a bad one. It was a rope June could put her hand on when the hallway pitched. Out in the parking lot, Bram\u2019s legs did the loose thing they did when his brain had been sprinting for hours; he sat on a parking bumper and laughed without making a sound for a full half minute. When he got his lungs back he said, \u201cWe got the door to trust a ghost,\u201d and the sentence blew June sideways like a gust.\n\n\u201cWe made a family out of a Compact and a crowd,\u201d she said, because it mattered that this not be a miracle. It had to be a technique.\n\nBack at the apartment, the air had decided to stop pretending it wasn\u2019t winter. June took the coin from her pocket and set it on the dresser where Wren\u2019s brush lay like a relic. The coin wobbled in the small divot in the wood that their father had told them was a flaw in the tree and in the hands that worked it. She touched the brush and thought about the hundreds of mornings that had been made by that moved pigment, the choices you make when you look in a mirror and allow yourself to be looked at by yourself. The not-key went under the pillow again because that was where it slept when not being asked to be a sheaf of futures.\n\nThe letter on the table had three new pages she swore had not been there when she left. She did not read them because her body remembered the feeling after the last time, the way receiving instruction had stained the day that followed with the sense that she had not properly resisted. She held the paper to her nose and breathed in lemon and heat and the faintest tang of something like iron. She slid the pages back under the older text like a person slipping an eccentric aunt under a table to stop her from tapping her spoon. She made tea. She watched the street. She heard a siren that did not belong to police or to ambulances. It belonged to a factory that had been turned into apartments and kept the siren for the romance of its past.\n\nMessages came the way geese do\u2014one too early, three at once, then a lull that made you think maybe the season had turned. Dr. Yi wrote to say that the sim team had been given an unscheduled block on the big rig and did she want to hold the stick for the storm run named after a tooth. Sana wrote to say the riders had gone home without arrests but two had lost phones to the kind of police who only like devices when they are someone else\u2019s alibi, and could the commission fund replacements without filing it through a rubric that would make the riders into homework. The judge with the scarves sent a picture of his dog, which was the way some men apologize for the parts of themselves that cannot be shared. Professor Salvatore sent a list of names of old union leaders and one of them had the last name Ibarra and June stared at it until the letters became rivers and then looked away.\n\nNear dusk, the elevator in her building sighed in a way that promised a visitor and produced one. The woman in the blue felt hat did not come in; she stood in the doorway the way she must have taught herself not to and not to do. Behind her, a young man in a jacket that cost as much as a month\u2019s rent held a white envelope like a tray.\n\n\u201cThis is the pale envelope,\u201d the woman said without apology. \u201cA Board subcommittee tasked with making you easier to love would like to offer you a budget and an office that does not smell like rain. They would like to give you staff with long r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and the kind of snacks that make people forgive things. They would like to cap your public activity in exchange for access. They would like to call this partnership.\u201d She tilted her head as if listening to a faint radio station in the walls. \u201cI believe you are not going to take this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy bring it,\u201d June asked, and watched the whisker-fine muscles around the woman\u2019s mouth choose an answer.\n\n\u201cBecause I believe in minutes,\u201d the woman said. \u201cSometimes it is useful to hold a minute where the other side thinks you are tempted.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d June said, because she did not want to pretend virtue she didn\u2019t possess. \u201cI would like snacks and bodies that can do the work without falling down.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it works,\u201d the woman said, and let herself smile. \u201cDon\u2019t sign. It hands them your minutes.\u201d\n\nJune took the envelope because that\u2019s what you do when the ritual arrives. You do not slam a door on a sacrament; you place it on a table and you let it be a center of gravity and you bring your hands up empty. When the door closed, she held the envelope up to the light and saw the outlines of an office, a stipend, the kind of language that had learned to drop bullets like confetti. She slid the thing under a stack of grocery receipts and mailers for dental plans and felt an ordinary fury lift from her stomach to her throat and then settle in the hinge of her jaw.\n\nShe walked to the river without telling anybody or telling herself it was stupid not to tell anybody. The water wasn\u2019t a metaphor and it was. Along the railing, someone had tied a ribbon around the spot where the night had come apart. June put her hand flat on the cold metal and felt the strange mammalian comfort of touch. \u201cI\u2019m going to carry you where you don\u2019t want to go,\u201d she said into the wind, and her words blew back into her own face and made her cheeks hurt. \u201cYou can hate me later.\u201d\n\nAt home, the apartment sounded like the inside of a shell\u2014the hum of electricity, the high whine of the refrigerator\u2019s self-regard, the neighbor\u2019s footfall above her as regular as an apology. She poured soup out of a carton and watched the slow physics of it filling the bowl. In the darkness of her phone, an alert brightened that did not belong to any app she had installed. It said: Summons\u2014Gate South, Proximity Test II. It said: bring coin, counsel, choir. It said: schedule accelerated due to externalities. It said: weather window closing. It said: forty-eight hours.\n\nJune lay down on the rug with her feet on the couch because that is the position some bodies need to remember they are not a catalog of tasks. She pictured the door, the seam, the panel, the wakened light like an animal opening one eye in the morning to see if the room is the same as the room it fell asleep in. She thought of the coin\u2019s edge under her thumb and the feeling of the not-key ticking against her pulse. She thought of Wren\u2019s mouth putting itself together around a sentence she didn\u2019t get to finish. She thought of Dr. Yi\u2019s weather spin and the way nine minutes could be visible on a body like a bruise days later. She closed her eyes and counted forward to ten and back to zero until the numbers loosened their belts and stopped telling time.\n\nShe dreamed that the Ark called her by the wrong name. She dreamed that the door opened and her father walked out with paint on his hands and said he had found a better color for the kitchen. She dreamed a field of chairs holding a referendum on sitting. She woke to the sound of someone singing outside in a voice that believed itself and did not care who else did. In the gray light, her phone shone with Bram\u2019s name and a message that said: we need to borrow the stadium because the choir needs room, and also because the Board hates images of crowds that don\u2019t belong to them. She wrote back: talk to the band with the old sound system. Talk to the pastor who thinks God is a committee. Ask Sana to ask the nurses to bring the shade tents that don\u2019t require permits.\n\nOn campus, the stairwell smelled like chlorine and fruit rinds. Dr. Yi had circles under his eyes whose color names she didn\u2019t have, and his hair had chosen a side in a fight. \u201cStorm run at sixteen hundred,\u201d he said, and handed her a printout because his eyes needed the comfort of paper as much as his mouth needed the lie that this was an ordinary day. \u201cIf the Commission lets you off your leash.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Commission is a leash,\u201d she said, and he smiled with a pain that had been cultivated over a lifetime into something useful.\n\nSana rolled up like a tide with two riders in tow and a woman June didn\u2019t know whose headscarf had constellations. \u201cWe brought the kind of people they count,\u201d Sana said. \u201cData architects who don\u2019t like their own fountains and a grandmother whose phone has been ritualized by seven grandchildren. When we say yes, it will sound like rent.\u201d\n\nProfessor Salvatore had the look men get when they fill their pockets with pellets before a long walk and decide not to count them. \u201cThere\u2019s a rule in old parliamentary procedure that if you don\u2019t have the votes you elongate time,\u201d he said, no hello because he was not that kind of man today. \u201cThe Board will try to make the weather window a rope they can pull through their hands. We will stub our toe on their calendar and make them curse.\u201d\n\nThey took over the stadium with a permission no one had written because the gate guard sang in the pastor\u2019s choir and the band\u2019s old sound system had a coat of stickers that marked it as a veteran. Bram and his crew installed devices that looked like benign dandelions in the concrete seams and carefully did not call them anything. The nurses set up water tables and shade so people could be a public without collapsing. The judge with the scarf stood in a doorway as if he had spent a long life in doorways waiting to be asked to count a quorum. Korr briefed volunteers like a general who understands that the front is a moving target. The woman in the felt hat came and stood high in the bleachers like a seagull and pretended to check her messages for an hour and did nothing that indicated she had ever eaten a crust.\n\nJune watched the chairs fill with bodies and thought about how law is made out of breath and stamina and the willingness to stand in the same square foot for an hour. When she spoke into the microphone that sounded worse than the room, she said less than she wanted to and more than the Board liked. She told the people to say yes and mean it and not to sing if they didn\u2019t consent. She told them the door likes obligations. She told them to think of the Ark as a bad-tempered ancestor who knew more than you and would do worse if unsupervised. They laughed in the way people do when you ask them to perform a new emotion in public and they try it on and find that it fits around the shoulders.\n\nThe second proximity test had the cadence of a wedding you crash because the groom owes you money. The door had been expecting them; the lights woke with the efficiency of a host who has already put the bottles in ice. The handler\u2019s smile was smaller. The Board\u2019s counsel had brought a different tie. The woman in the blue felt hat had a hard line at the corner of her mouth that made June think about good boots. The judge with the scarf took off his scarf and folded it, setting it on the rail like a placenta. Korr\u2019s rings clicked. Bram\u2019s map pulsed.\n\n\u201cRelational chord required,\u201d the door said, before anyone had even begun to rehearse politeness. \u201cProximity of oversight affirmed. Co-presence confirmation pending. Present kinship proof.\u201d\n\nJune placed the coin. The judge placed his chip because ritual is a first language. Korr read the clause aloud because the law likes to be invited to its own party. June took the not-key out of her pocket and let the metal touch the seam in the way you touch a sleeping child to wake them without making them afraid. The mesh flared. The stadium breathed into its own microphones and the sound reached the Ark by the conduit Bram had built out of consent and indignation. A thousand yeses sounded, not in chorus like a hymn performed for quality, but as a wave a shore recognizes.\n\nThis time the door opened something large enough to put a hand through. The seam became a lid. The hinge remembered itself. The panel slid a fraction in. Cold air exhaled from the space beyond with a smell like storms and new wiring. The handler made a sound that would not go on the record. The Board\u2019s counsel moved forward and stopped himself by polishing his ring against his paper. The woman in the felt hat closed her eyes, and the movement was so small that if you had not been watching her for days you would have missed it; June saw it and understood she was watching someone whose job it was to hate hope guard against a moment of oxygen.\n\n\u201cRecognition\u2014proxy accepted,\u201d the voice said. \u201cLimiting function applied. Scope: life support, emergency protocol, human allocation veto, habitat expansion freeze pending review. Clock initiated. Thirty-six hours.\u201d\n\nKorr hissed the way a mother cat does when a hawk\u2019s shadow crosses a yard. \u201cThey have given us a frame,\u201d she said, and then corrected herself as a professional does when lying even in private does harm. \u201cWe have taken a frame. It will shrink if we do not fill it immediately.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the seam, the Ark hummed the song of its own weather. June stepped forward until the handler\u2019s hand and Korr\u2019s hand and law itself rested on her shoulder, not to stop her and not to let her go alone but to make the movement one the story could afford. Inside, the architecture of the core looked like someone had taught physics to weave. The rings layered in on themselves like promises kept after the fact. The throbbing lights did not pulse for her; they pulsed because that is what they do. She felt gripped by a love so uglily named you can\u2019t say it at a microphone without being mistaken for a person who has chosen the wrong room.\n\nShe turned back because this was not the chapter where she walked ahead. Bram\u2019s eyes were wet with the exact amount a body allows before deciding to call the event weather. Korr wrote with a pen that had its own weight. The judge spoke and made his words into hooks. The riders\u2019 representative checked her watch and started calling kitchens, because if people were going to stand for the next day and a half they would need soup. Sana took a video of nothing in particular and sent it to a list that sunburned the Board\u2019s public relations feed. The woman in the felt hat texted someone and then put her phone in her pocket and stood with her hands empty for a full minute as if she were making a choice about what she could hold.\n\nThey poured themselves out into the afternoon and it felt, surprisingly, like coming back from a swim into air that forgives you. The stadium kept breathing behind them. The city leaned in with its thousand mouths and demanded updates translated into images. June walked with Bram down a flight of concrete stairs that smelled like spilled beer and wind and told him about the taste in her mouth that reminded her of oranges and blood. He told her about a line of code that had decided to be interesting at two in the morning and how he had told it to go back to sleep. They laughed in a way that didn\u2019t sound like laughter because laughter is what your body makes when it thinks it will be allowed to live.\n\nOn her door waited another envelope with the old eagle, this one small as a palm and heavy as a hope. Inside, a card with six sentences and the kind of handwriting old presidents pretend to have time for. It said: you have thirty-six hours to make a dent so lasting even the ship\u2019s math will have to note it. It said: do not waste a minute pretending to be clean. It said: the door likes obligations that rhyme, so align oxygen with equity and see if the machine blushes. It said: call the river into the room with you by carrying its mud on your shoes. It said: you will be accused of madness. It said: good.\n\nShe set the card down beside the coin and the brush and the chisel. She washed her hands and watched the water go opaque where it met the oil from the blade. She sat at the table and made a list in pencil, because pencil allows for wrong. She wrote: oxygen ratios\u2014public allocation model; safety protocols\u2014human veto triggers; habitat expansion\u2014freeze enforcement; selection metric\u2014de-bias, public oversight; land rights\u2014moratorium language; labor\u2014union compacts embedded; emergency\u2014who counts as saved. She drew a box around the line labeled oxygen and wrote beside it: obligations with dirt.\n\nAt midnight, Bram texted from a room that hummed with borrowed power, saying he had found a way to make the Ark\u2019s register echo the word veto in a tone the human ear would accept as serious. Sana sent a photograph of the grandmother with the ritualized phone asleep in a chair with a blanket on her lap, mouth open, dreams audible. Korr sent a list of words the Board would try to smuggle into their drafts: optimize, streamline, efficiency, sustainability. Beside each, she had written a counter-word: duty, care, effort, repair. Professor Salvatore sent a recording of himself reading out loud from the Compact\u2019s footnotes, a bedtime story about stubborn rivers. The woman in the felt hat did not send anything, which was a gift June recognized and decided to receive as such.\n\nShe slept because exhaustion is a tool you respect. She woke before the sun could pretend to be noble. She put on the jacket with the shoulders. She tucked the coin and the not-key where skin made them real. She set the chisel down in the place of honor and touched it not because she believed objects could bless but because the body likes to do the last thing twice when the next thing is difficult. She closed the window because Wren always left it open. She whispered a sentence to the room that had learned how to hold sentences. She went out into a city that had, overnight, hung new banners on its cranes, little cloths that said words like breath and neighbor, and into a morning that did the one thing it could be counted on to do: arrive.",

June stood at the window while the kettle learned its single trick and watched the cables by the river sag and rise with wind that pretended to be important. On the dresser the coin had settled into the wood\u2019s divot as if it had grown there, the not-key under the pillow warming to the temperature of a plan. Thirty-six hours had turned into eighteen and then into a block of time that her brain refused to measure because measurement made it small. She wrote in pencil because the graphite allowed room for cowardice and then converted it into courage. Oxygen first, she told herself, because breath is what propaganda uses when it wants to be forgiven later.\n\nKorr arrived like weather with a briefcase that had clearly fallen down stairs in its youth and learned not to apologize. She laid out paper like bandages and pointed with a ringed finger at the list June had made, nodding at some words and razoring others with the gentleness of a person who likes the people she has to wound. \u201cWe braid oxygen into equity by making allocation a function of care and contribution, not of status,\u201d she said, and her voice had the graveyard humor of a nurse. \u201cSleep cycles synced across roles, not ranks. Heat rations responsive to bodies in recovery. Work assignments that recognize a day spent fixing the water line equals a day not counted against your allotment for rest. They will call it soft. We will call it survival.\u201d\n\nBram unfolded himself from the doorway with the hungry look he got when the problem had stopped being abstract and started being a number he could put in an equation and then refuse. He smelled like borrowed coffee and tatty optimism. \u201cIf the Ark\u2019s register accepts new invariants at a governance layer, we can define commitments the scheduler must satisfy before optimizing anything else,\u201d he said, and his hands described a lattice in the air without his permission. \u201cWe make oxygen allocation a hard constraint tied to community labor hours and care metrics. We make care legible to math without torturing it into productivity. We\u2019re going to trick an optimizer into learning the word duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t trick it,\u201d June said, feeling how the words tasted in her mouth like promises you bite to check the coin. \u201cYou feed it examples until it gets religion.\u201d\n\nThey went to the stadium because bodies were still the unit of measure that made the Board nervous. The riders had set up a whiteboard the size of a good wall and Sana had written in block letters above it: HOW DO WE BREATHE TOGETHER. Nurses wrote down hours that were invisible in models and had to be made visible, like the time you spent walking a child around a room at three a.m. so he would not forget that air was for him, too. A cook who had never been invited into a room where governance was supposed to happen described grease traps and why their cleaning schedule affected morale, which affected accident rates, which would show up as oxygen spikes if the Ark bothered to measure joy. A waste tech whose hands had a permanent smell like honesty explained the fluid dynamics of pipes with a competence that made the Board\u2019s handler go very still and stop taking notes, because sometimes attention is a form of theft.\n\nJune listened with the hunger of a person who had been asked to build a law and remembered at the last minute that law is not stone, it is tissue. She wrote and wrote until the graphite made a smudge she would carry on her hand into every photo forever. When the blue felt hat appeared high up under the eaves, June felt the small click in her back that meant her body had noticed an old enemy in a new coat and did not much care whether the coat was kind. The woman stood with her hands in her pockets the way people do when they have given their fingers something to hold out of sight. When the stadium speakers squealed and settled, June looked up and gave the woman a brief chin, a hello you can deny in a deposition.\n\nAt Gate South the Ark crouched in its dry cradle like an animal that would pretend to be docile for as long as domes and paperwork were required. The handler had a mark on his cheek he had not had yesterday and a way of holding himself that suggested someone had shouted and he had not shouted back, which made him worse to talk to. He walked them through the parts they already knew as if repetition would make obedience and afterwards looked at Korr in the manner of a man who suspects he is standing next to a person who owns an older map. \u201cYou got your window,\u201d he said, staring past them into the hallway where the air did not know who it was yet. \u201cUse it without breaking anything we can\u2019t solder.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe intend to break only the things that were pretending to be unbreakable,\u201d Korr said, and lifted her torpedo thermos in a toast meant for exactly three human beings.\n\nThe panel in the verification bay had the awake look of a creature interrupted mid-molt. The seam was still a seam, the hinge a suggestion, the light a steady, unperformative steady. June could feel the mesh Bram had draped across the city thrumming like a net you keep your hand against so you know the sea hasn\u2019t chosen some other mood. She set the coin down with the formality that had built the courts in the first place. She refused to pretend she was not tallying every superstition. The judge placed his chip, the riders\u2019 representative leaned her helmet against the wall as if daring it to remember the impact of contact, the nurse stood with her knees slightly bent the way you do when you know the floor has layers.\n\n\u201cProximity and attestation confirmed,\u201d the not-voice said. \u201cScope open on presented domains. Provide invariants.\u201d\n\nBram looked at June the way he looked at puzzles and at people in pain. This is your part, his face said, and she swallowed the air that was available and stepped into the box their bodies made around the microphone. \u201cOxygen allocation obeys a rule that ties breath to responsibility, not to rank,\u201d she said, and she hated how summarized it sounded and was grateful to have language to make it into truth. \u201cCare work counts. Maintenance counts. Parenting counts. Small-body caretaking counts. Recovery counts. Community chores count. Meetings that take more than an hour without a decision count against your share,\u201d she added, the room allowing itself a grin and then letting it go. \u201cNo ration falls below a floor defined by bodies not by budgets. No vent opens wider because someone has better shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cInput requires quantification,\u201d the Ark said, and June stared at the panel and thought about how even in this it wanted her to demonstrate love by making a list. The nurses and the waste tech and the cooks started talking in measures, in minutes and liters and kJ per hour and heartbeats, and Bram caught their numbers and did not tame them, only translated them into what the register could swallow without spitting. Korr inserted a clause about audits that couldn\u2019t be faked without leaving a mark a child could see. The judge swore so softly it did not go on the record that audits would be human and would have chairs.\n\nThe door accepted the first invariant without ceremony and June felt something loosen at the base of her skull as if a bird had taken a breath there and decided to live. They moved quickly because hours are bones and bones need flesh. Emergency protocols came next: triggers that any human could pull that would freeze nonessential processes without having to petition a chair or a stack, a veto that required two bodies in agreement and a witness, and an after-action rule that said what had been frozen must justify itself to be thawed. The Ark did not like being told to stop, you could hear it in the way its silence thickened, and still it ate the invariant because the choir said yes and yes in the stadium and at kitchen tables and in line at the clinic and because the coin sat there like an old moon.\n\nHabitat expansion felt like asking a river to spell its own name while men put a pipe in it. Korr wrote language that tied new space to past harm: no new square meter without a restoration of a square meter somewhere else, no new block without a fund that measured health in something other than return. Bram made a face and said the register would want to cash the fund in a currency it understood, and the waste tech said all right, then, make the unit a child\u2019s lung, and the register paused long enough that the handler shifted his weight.\n\nThey saved Selection for after water because June had learned that a room will bear a certain amount of anger if you feed it first. She had never expected to say aloud the numbers that had been claws in her head since the letter arrived, and her voice did a thing that made Korr stand close enough to be smelled. \u201cWe kill the phrenology in the model,\u201d she said, and she tasted iron. \u201cWe take beauty out of it in every proxy it wears. We take schools out of it in every uniform they wear. We take last names out where they lie about endurance. We add public oversight that can halt any cohort and remake it. We add a rule that says anyone selected can bring one person who has an obligation to them or from them that the public will recognize.\u201d She did not say the word sister. She did not say the name the river knew. She watched the woman in the felt hat close her eyes a fraction because even good enemies have sisters they are worried about.\n\nThe Ark asked for the graph that would hold these obligations without being gamed and Bram gave it a scaffold that required weight to be distributed like a table that will tip if you put all your soup on one side. Sana texted from the stadium to say the choir was beginning to sound like a storm because someone had started the rhythm on the bleachers and the kids had turned it into art. The judge said a sentence so plain it made June ache: \u201cNo one goes alone on a contract written for a century,\u201d and the register accepted the line because it had learned, reluctantly, to admire sentences that did not need a semicolon.\n\nBy late afternoon June\u2019s hands shook the way a craftsman\u2019s hands shake when the bench is clean or when the cut cannot be un-cut. They had turned air into law and law into a small series of numbers that would not let the ship lie to itself without leaving a bruise that could be written down. They had set trip lines for executives in slim suits with vocabulary that whisked. They had built a quorum and taught it to breathe on command. The handler looked at the panel with the face of a man watching a dog he did not buy become a member of the family, and then he set his mouth and reached for his tablet and started writing instructions anyway, which made June want to forgive him as much as it made her want to drown him.\n\nThe blue felt hat came toward them at dusk like a small moon with someone\u2019s head under it. She did not remove it in the room because this was not a church and because the Ark did not care if anyone was bald. \u201cYou have twenty hours before the litigation that no one will talk about on the record turns these constraints into suggestions they can ignore without appearing disobedient,\u201d she said, and for once there was no offer in her tone, only a ledger. \u201cYou need to weld what you\u2019ve built to something physical that a Board can\u2019t respec in an afternoon. Bring your mud.\u201d\n\nJune had not planned to do the thing the letter suggested she do because it sounded like theater and she was trying to be an adult. Now she borrowed a bucket from a janitor who asked no questions and went to the river as if the city had just invented rivers and needed a first customer. She walked down the stairs under the bridge to where the water made the sound that had taught her to count, and she scooped and scooped until the bucket weighed like a promise. Back in the bay, the handler watched with the neutrality of a person who knows that in a year this will either be policy or a story he tells in private. June smeared mud in the hairline crack where the verification panel met the wall and in the seam of the floor where rubber met metal and across the lip of the coin\u2019s little shelf. It was absurd and it was honest. The register, which had been built by people whose childhoods had not made room for dirt, took a whiff of the river and hiccuped.\n\n\u201cBaseline contamination detected,\u201d it said, and its voice had the scandalized lilt of a machine that has read too many manuals. \u201cAnchoring environmental reference to present state.\u201d\n\nKorr swore in a language the Ark could not store and grabbed June by the elbow so hard she\u2019d have a circle there tomorrow. \u201cYou just told it that air is from here,\u201d she whispered, and her eyes had the shine of a person who has watched rooms and laws and men try to pretend the world is an abstraction they can move with a finger and then seen someone nail the skirt of reality to the floor. \u201cYou told it that when the numbers change they have to explain themselves to the river.\u201d\n\nBram laughed the quiet laugh that eats shame and spatters joy. \u201cWe just made a ghost parameter,\u201d he said, and typed with the gentleness of a priest handling an old book. \u201cWe gave the register a sense of home. Now if the Board tries to jack the oxygen mix in the name of efficiency the ship will ask why it doesn\u2019t smell like the thing it married.\u201d\n\nJune leaned her forehead against the wall and took a breath she would not allow herself to call sacred. The blue felt hat woman stood with her shoulder against a post and let the smallest smile walk across her mouth like a cat. \u201cIt won\u2019t save you from everything,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it will slow any man who believes clean hands are the only hands worth trusting.\u201d She hesitated, then took off the hat like a person who has decided to perform intimacy in order to survive. Underneath, her hair was cut blunt to survive weather and her face looked less like an emblem and more like a file of decisions. \u201cMy name is Halim,\u201d she said. \u201cI would prefer not to be your friend. I am trying hard to be your witness.\u201d\n\nThe night after they smeared the river onto the ship had the feeling of a threshold you can\u2019t see until you\u2019ve gone past it and then you realize the room behind you has different light. June went home with mud under her fingernails and expected to be told off by the letter for being theatrical. Instead, the next page said: good. She washed her hands and left a little brown at the edges because some superstition has earned its keep. When she lay down, the not-key in the pillow felt like a rib. She dreamed she walked down into the Ark and two old women were sitting on milk crates arguing about how much salt you put in soup, and when she asked them their names they both said her aunt\u2019s.\n\nAt morning the stadium smelled like oranges because someone had cut a hundred for the choir. The judge counted himself astonished and then repeated it until it sounded like a court order. Dr. Yi stood beneath a sign that asked patrons not to bring glass and told June he had taken a long walk and had decided these were the only eight hours in his life he had not felt like he was making compromises with instruments. Sana had a bandage on her wrist and a grin that said her body had been used by the day and had not filed a complaint. The riders had devised a game with their spare helmets that, if played by a Board, would result in a lawsuit.\n\nThey had one domain left to embed before the window narrowed into a sort of neck: land. No one wanted to say it because saying land in a room like that made people remember conquest and debt and uncles who contradicted themselves at weddings. Korr wrote language that required any initial carving of Aletheia to be a stewardship and then a stewardship again, rights nested in obligations, any parcel subject to review by a body that had no investors and had to eat with the people it governed. Bram sighed because trees on a map are always prettier than trees, and June finished his thought out loud so he wouldn\u2019t have to. \u201cWe abolish permanent private ownership in the first hundred years,\u201d she said, and the handler closed his eyes because he had been told to keep them open and this was how he could disobey without losing his job. \u201cWe permit ten-year leases for use, tuned to purposes that have to be argued aloud. We build a registry that hears stories, not just coordinates. We make sure that if a person plants a tree there isn\u2019t a lawyer waiting under it to sell the shade.\u201d\n\nThe register accepted the invariant more easily than June would have liked and she felt a flash of anger at the machine for not making a show of its surrender. Halim watched the handler watch his own posture and had the courtesy not to enjoy it. Professor Salvatore, who had been quiet in the way men are quiet when they do not want to cry in front of their students, put a hand to his mouth and took it away and said, \u201cThis is going to make writing papers very annoying,\u201d and everyone laughed because it was either that or break something new.\n\nWhen the clock collapsed into hours you can remember without numbers, the Board brought reality to the table in the shape of a woman with a voice soft enough to sand a beam. She had a file full of drafts and her talent was to make language behave. She proposed slight edits meant to \u201cclarify intent\u201d and \u201csmooth implementation,\u201d and every line was a trap disguised as grammar. Korr swatted them like mosquitoes and let herself be bitten by one or two on purpose so she could slap them on the record later. The handler looked grateful without meaning to because competent enemies are a relief, and Halim kept her eyes on the drafts and her hands in her pockets and once in a while said no, and her no had the weight of someone who had never been allowed to use that word cheaply.\n\nIn the last hour the door wanted a ritual and June almost laughed because she was so tired she would have given it a dance if it asked. The register required signatures not in name but in the shape of voices and the shape of hands, and so they put a hand to the panel and spoke one sentence each, not out of vanity but to leave a residue in the machine that would be hard to rinse. The nurse said, \u201cI have held lungs in my hands; air is not an idea.\u201d The waste tech said, \u201cPipes are honest if you listen.\u201d The judge said, \u201cSo attested,\u201d and the register recorded the shape of his breath. Sana said, \u201cSand in the gears,\u201d and Halim, after a pause so long it could have been a refuse, said, \u201cProceed,\u201d and her voice carried exactly the amount of wear required, and June thought for a foolish second that maybe the Board did not always hire people to be in her way, maybe sometimes they hired people to keep each other from falling.\n\nJune did not prepare a sentence and then she found one in her pocket where the coin had been. \u201cWe will count time in children and trees, not in quarters,\u201d she said, and when the register took it as an annotation she felt a ridiculous and intolerable flood of relief. Bram squeezed her arm, and his hand was warm from work and not from fear. Korr handed the handler a copy of the invariants as if the machine might misplace them and the man who loved it might be trusted to keep them safe. Professor Salvatore took off his glasses and cleaned them on his tie and put them back on because he was a clich\u00e9 and had decided long ago to be fine with that.\n\nWhen the window closed it did not slam; it faded in that bureaucratic way systems have when they are proud of their dampers. The seam snugged, the hinge remembered it was metal, the light went from listening to polite. The handler exhaled like a man guarding a door that no one can agree is a door. Halim put on her hat as if returning a cloud to the sky. The riders clattered out and got on their bikes and did not look back because speed is a kind of prayer. June picked up the coin and for a second it felt heavier, as if metal had learned something about weather.\n\nOutside the air was a laugh colder and the cranes with their protest banners had changed their words and now they said nothing because the wind had turned and it made more sense to keep still. June stood on the curb with Bram and Korr and Salvatore and Sana and Halim and the handler, an ugly family portrait with no chance of being printed, and realized she was swaying. Korr touched her elbow as if she had spent a life on battlefields and knew exactly when a soldier would fall. \u201cEat,\u201d she said. \u201cSleep. Then get ready to defend this like a dog with a bone who has also read the footnotes.\u201d\n\nAt home the apartment had rearranged itself around the space Wren had always left behind her, the way light rearranges itself when a person moves out of a room. June took Wren\u2019s brush and drew a single line on the inside of her eye as if to stay in practice. The letter on the table had sprung a corner like a book left open too long. She sat on the floor and read with the concentration of a student who has decided to stay in a class she hates because the teacher might be right anyway. The page said: you did not save what you think you saved. The page said: you made it possible for someone else to save it. The page said: they will call you a thief and a witch and a child. The page said: you will be all three and it will not matter. The page said: the Ark will hum a song you know in your bones, and you will hate that you love it. The page said: tomorrow, stand very still when they ask you to move.\n\nShe woke to sirens that belonged to news, which is to say to men who believed their own voices were urgent. The Ark\u2019s schedule had shifted by a day and then by no days and then by a little sliver no one could measure. The Board did a press conference in which a man with a smile like salt said the word community fifteen times and the word equity once and the word oversight not at all. Halim stood behind him and looked like someone who had eaten something she didn\u2019t order and was waiting to see if it would make her sick. Bram sent a link to a thread where the Ark\u2019s register had politely refused a maintenance request because it violated the new invariant and the engineer had written back \u201clol\u201d and then written \u201coh\u201d and then written \u201cwho did this,\u201d and Sana texted a photograph of ten kids writing on their shoes in marker the words I AM A PUBLIC.\n\nJune went to campus because her body thought class was still a place where the rules were simpler. Dr. Yi handed her a sheaf of printouts and said nothing and then said one thing, which was, \u201cThey redrew the weather for launch day to make it look pretty,\u201d and she nodded because launch is ceremony and ceremony hates rain. Professor Salvatore lectured about colonial charters that tried to avoid the word theft and used the word gift until the word died, and June took notes and wanted to throw her pencil and instead held it until the wood dented. A student in the back stood up and asked if this was all naive and Salvatore said yes and no and then told a story about a man who got to the top of a hill and said the view was inevitable and an old woman who had carried a brick up the same hill and said, don\u2019t be an idiot.\n\nOn the way home June saw the woman with the felt hat walking alone across the green the Board had donated the year the city stopped trying to mow it. Halim\u2019s hat was tilted against no weather. June fell in step not because friendship had been offered but because proximity is its own law. \u201cYou weren\u2019t hired to be this person,\u201d June said, not asking because some sentences do better as declarations.\n\n\u201cNo one was,\u201d Halim said, and kept her eyes on the bricks because it is a relief not to look at someone when you say the thing your job will punish you for later. \u201cThe job trains you to carry two registers at once. In one you tally costs. In the other you count what you will be ashamed of. The trick is to make the first register hear the second before you retire.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think it works,\u201d June asked, and the answer didn\u2019t matter and still she needed to hear it, because there are days when someone\u2019s belief is the only energy you can metabolize.\n\n\u201cToday it did,\u201d Halim said. \u201cTomorrow it will not. The day after that it might again if you haven\u2019t bled out all your stubbornness.\u201d She stopped, which was a form of gift, and added, \u201cThere is a machine I would like you to break for me when you are President. It is a small one. It sits in a lobby and prints badges that say Visitor, and it recognizes some smiles and not others.\u201d\n\nJune laughed and her own voice surprised her by sounding ordinary. \u201cWrite me a letter,\u201d she said. \u201cUse an old seal. Include a coin.\u201d\n\nThe night before the launch the city came outside and stood on sidewalks like a congregation in need of an excuse. Drones traced polite circles with lights that pretended to be stars. The Ark glowed like the inside of a throat and the drums that had always been drums before there were drums started to sound on the metal things built to be hit. June walked with Bram and Sana and Korr and Salvatore and Dr. Yi to the fence where the air tasted like electricity and recipes. The riders leaned on their bikes and pretended to be bored because the alternative was to cry. The nurse had taken off her shoes and stood on the grass because some parts of you cannot be in rubber when you watch your future pretend to become simple.\n\nA man with a sign that said GOD IS A COMMITTEE held it up without shouting because the pastor had taught him volume is not the only persuasive tool. A woman with a toddler on her shoulders pointed at the plume of steam like a mountain being born and said the word ship in a way that made it sound like she was practicing saying the child\u2019s name. Halim stood at the end of a row of people who were not supposed to like each other and kept her hat on and her hands in her pockets and watched the seam that had opened and closed and opened and closed for them like a living thing\u2019s mouth.\n\nJune put her fingers to the coin in her pocket because you can\u2019t touch a ship. She thought of Wren in a coat too thin for weather and of the knife on the counter and of the night that had done what nights do and refused to save anyone. The count climbed down the ladder of numbers and she wanted to look away and the letter in her head told her not to look away because that is how you become the person who forgot to sign the page. When the ground said go in the only language heavy things ever really accept, the Ark did not leap like a good story; it leaned and bullied and begged and finally lifted with the slow violence of a promise kept. The sound was indescribable and therefore described poorly by everyone who tried for the next year. June\u2019s cheeks were wet and the mud under her nails itched and the register in her ear\u2014the whisper the Ark had released for oversight to hear\u2014said oxygen metrics nominal, duty constraints engaged, and she smiled because even machines can be forced to pronounce new words.\n\nShe did not cheer. She stood very still because the letter had told her that standing still would undo someone\u2019s camera trick, and because stillness, in that moment, felt like prayer without God. Bram sobbed the way boys do when they remember they are allowed to and tried to cover it with a cough and failed and gave up and Sana took his hand like she had been practicing that exact action for a week. Korr laughed with her head back like a woman who would lose all her cases tomorrow and did not care because today she had gotten to say the word moratorium into a microphone until it stuck. Professor Salvatore said, \u201cWe will teach this badly for years,\u201d and Dr. Yi\u2019s face had the wrecked, exquisite look of a person who had finally watched his models fail in a way that meant truth was happening.\n\nWhen the Ark pulled its enormous body free and the air rushed in to fill the wound, the city made a sound that will be in the footage that gets played in rooms where people put coats over chairs and sit up straighter. It was not triumph and it was not grief. It was the noise people make when they realize their story will be told about them whether they write it or not, and decide to pick up a pen anyway. The seam on the verification panel slid shut like an eyelid, and under it, in the hairline crack where a woman had smeared a river, a line of mud dried into something like a signature.",

June woke to the scrape of a broom in the hall and a child practicing a whistle on the landing and the giddy, guilty quiet that happens after a riot that didn\u2019t end in blood. On the dresser, the coin had sank itself deeper into the divot as if metal could root. Under the pillow, the not-key radiated the patient cold of an instrument between tasks. The line she had drawn on her eye the night before had smudged into the kind of bruise that isn\u2019t a bruise, just pigment that has spent the night arguing with sheets. She stood for a minute looking at the brush and felt the old urge to put color where the face insists on being the color it is. Then she made tea and put her forehead on the cool window and counted buses the way other people count rosaries.\n\nHer phone shook with a sequence of messages that called themselves urgent without understanding how small they were in the scale of urgencies. The Board wanted to schedule a \u201cconstructive debrief\u201d in a room with glass walls. The Commission\u2019s feed unfurled a docket in a font that believed time was infinite. Korr wrote two words that were the opposite of panic\u2014next steps\u2014and added an address. Bram sent a clip that showed the Ark\u2019s register pinging a maintenance request with a note that read in an entirely new tone: violates duty constraint; provide argument. Sana sent a picture of a sidewalk covered in chalk that said OUR LUNGS ARE INVITED and three children coloring the U with blue, because none of them could find white and none of them cared.\n\nAt the address above a bodega that still sold oranges even out of season, Korr sat behind a desk that had acquired scars the way some faces do when they decide not to pay for smoothness. She had taken off her rings, which meant someone would try a trick on the record. \u201cThey will file an emergency petition to stay the invariants on grounds of interference with safety protocols,\u201d she said, and slid a draft of the petition across the desk as if she were dealing cards in a game where you don\u2019t get to choose your hand, only whether you throw it back hard enough to bruise the dealer. \u201cWe will answer that safety is exactly what we interfered with. They\u2019ll whisper injunction and I\u2019ll say Compact. Also, their public affairs people will attempt to bury you under a wave of gratitude and we need to give them something else to talk about.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you liked gratitude,\u201d Bram said from the corner where he had installed his bones without telling anyone he was tired. He wore a shirt that had learned to admit it had been slept in on a couch, and his hair had selected a thesis that was uncitable.\n\n\u201cI like gratitude when it comes in bowls with steam,\u201d Korr said. \u201cI do not like gratitude when it arrives as a budget line with conditions attached. Speaking of which, the liaison\u2014your hat\u2014delivered a memo that pretends to be neutral advice about the optics of stewardship and is in fact a set of levers designed to pull you away from the choir and toward the Board\u2019s definition of public.\u201d She slid that over, too. The memo was full of verbs that had been domesticated: coordinate, streamline, uplift. It suggested a series of town halls with chairs screwed to the floor.\n\nJune skimmed the verbs and heated at the edges. \u201cThey want to put us in a circle they own,\u201d she said, and felt the ache beneath the anger, the ache that said it would be easier if the people with the good snacks were also right.\n\n\u201cThey want to photograph you while you speak into a microphone that\u2019s off,\u201d Korr said, with the cheerfulness of a midwife announcing a breech in a way that makes the room breathe. \u201cPolitely decline. Then show up somewhere they forgot to mow.\u201d\n\nThey took sandwiches to the stadium because the nurses had posted a sign that said: hydration checkpoint, please don\u2019t be noble, and June had learned to do what nurses tell you to do. The choir was thinner by daylight; people had gone to work or to sleep or to court. Sana had taped pieces of paper to the concrete and written large words\u2014OXYGEN, HABITAT, SELECTION, EMERGENCY\u2014and left markers that had the caps off, which is a liturgy in some cities. People wrote sentences that were almost recipes. If you give my grandmother extra heat I\u2019ll work the late shift. If you ask me to clean the grease traps more often give me more breaks on the lines. If a door breaks and I fix it that counts as breath. If I watch your kid it counts as a door you didn\u2019t have to hold.\n\nDr. Yi arrived with eyes like asphalt and a stack of printouts as thick as a wrist. \u201cThe Board just reparameterized the launch weather after-action to support a narrative of unalloyed success,\u201d he said, sitting on the bleacher below them and letting his body take two minutes to remember chairs. \u201cBut the navigational register pinged me for a review of an upcoming dust event on Aletheia\u2019s Approach Twelve. They\u2019re modeling it as minor. I\u2019m not sure minor is the right adjective.\u201d\n\nJune\u2019s stomach went ice and stayed there. Approach Twelve was a path she had flown until muscle memory learned the feel of it; the dust event would be the first whisper of the world the Ark was going to insist on calling home. \u201cTiming,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTwenty weeks into transit,\u201d Dr. Yi said. \u201cWhich means we have twenty minus logistics and egos to move the protocols we wrote under the cables across light and into discipline.\u201d He handed her a page where someone had tried to describe dust with numbers that had never been ashamed of their ignorance. \u201cI need the Commission\u2019s authority to require human veto drills on board. I need to make \u2018stop\u2019 an option that doesn\u2019t excise the person who uses it from the next round of breakfast invitations.\u201d\n\nKorr had appeared at his shoulder like a woman called into a room by the smell of a specific fear. \u201cWe can bind our emergency invariant to a training mandate,\u201d she said, pulling a pen from her hair as if it had lived there forever. \u201cWe can require that any cohort assigned to first contact tasks\u2014call them Plats, call them what they call themselves\u2014practice the veto three times in three different rooms before any land-side decision becomes real. And we can put those drills on a ledger that is public in a way the Board cannot edit without their hands showing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlats,\u201d June said, the word opening in her mouth like a bruise coming to the surface. The letter had used the word; she had not said it aloud because saying it would feed the part of the narrative that knew exactly where to place a knife. \u201cWe can call the person\u2019s name who holds the switch and ensure they get to keep it the next day.\u201d\n\n\u201cName and duty survive the drill,\u201d Bram said, writing rapidly on the inside lid of a takeout box as if an oath could be inscribed anywhere. \u201cWe make the measure of competence the willingness to stop, not a mania for go.\u201d\n\nThey took their draft to Gate South because the Ark\u2019s panel had become the place where language materialized into something the machine had to notice. The handler met them with a weariness made of two things: businessmen who had talked too long and a nightmare that had paused for breath. Halim was there, hat on and posture arranged in the profession of witness. She didn\u2019t have to announce that she had stopped two draft press releases from calling the crowd at the stadium unruly and instead instructed the interns to use the word attentive, but June could feel that labor in the way the air did not smell like insult.\n\nThe panel woke the way a dog wakes when you bring home a smell like river\u2014not frantic, not fawning, alert in a way your body remembers. \u201cProximity confirmed,\u201d the not-voice said, and it felt, oddly, like a greeting that had decided to be polite.\n\n\u201cWe are binding an emergency drill to the invariant,\u201d Korr said, speaking straight to the grain of the wall. \u201cThree drills, three rooms, one name that cannot be erased in the night. If a person pulls the stop and the stop was wrong in the eyes of a later machine, that person is not punished with the kinds of punishment machines are good at\u2014assignment, silence, schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuantify,\u201d the register said. \u201cDefine rooms. Define public.\u201d\n\nJune thought of rooms that count\u2014bridge, berth, storage, kitchen, clinic\u2014and read them into the air. She wanted to put the river on the list because it was a room, too, but she was tired and the machine was not a poet. Bram fed the definitions into a syntax that admitted nouns only when tethered to duties. Sana, standing behind them with a clutch of riders who were late for someplace and had come anyway, called out \u201cmess,\u201d and the register accepted mess as a room, which felt like the first time a school had done something right by accident.\n\nHalim stepped forward half a step, which in her vocabulary was a speech. \u201cWe need to make sure they do not perform these drills at hours that make attendance a punishment,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we need to require artifice if we are going to require rehearsals. The Board loves drills that can be gamed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe drills are designed by people who clean,\u201d the waste tech said, because she had somehow become a permanent fixture of these rooms and June was relieved every time she saw her. \u201cWe\u2019ll hide the switch. We\u2019ll put it near a leak. We\u2019ll make a mess big enough to embarrass anyone who tries to be efficient about it.\u201d\n\nThe register accepted the drill as if it had expected to. The handler\u2019s jaw moved as if chewing a truth that didn\u2019t want to be swallowed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had men lose fingers to drills,\u201d he said, soft, not to be quotable. \u201cNot actual drills\u2014the exercise sense. They build a ritual, then turn it into a trap. Don\u2019t let us do that with your stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot my stop,\u201d June said. \u201cOurs. And it stays sharp by being used.\u201d\n\nThe good moment lasted three breaths. Then the bad moments that had been saving up beat their hands on the door. Halim\u2019s phone chirped with a sound June had learned to hear as \u201cthis will ruin three meals\u201d and the color drained out of her face in a way so controlled it was almost art. \u201cThey\u2019ve petitioned an emergency hearing for an ex parte stay of the oversight scope on grounds of \u2018astronaut welfare,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cTranslation: they want to cut the tether to the choir before the dust.\u201d\n\nKorr took the news like a boxer absorbing a punch from a child. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cThey chose the word welfare; we will chain them to it. Call the judge. Call the nurse. Call anyone who has held a lung while a politician gave a speech.\u201d\n\nThe courtroom they were assigned had carpet that remembered shoes and a smell of lemon that made June think about her father\u2019s bottle and the way scent can be a bloodline. The Board\u2019s counsel came in with a scarf that looked like an apology and a stack of papers that looked like an accessory. He said the words safety and cohesion and unnecessary complexity with a reverence that made the words act like exhibits. Korr rose with the weariness of a woman who has had to explain gravity to people who profit from pretending they float.\n\n\u201cWhen the Compact says critical infrastructure,\u201d she said, walking the judge not through rhetoric but through mud, \u201cit means air and water and the systems that preserve them. It means bodies, not budgets. We imposed human brakes on a machine built to prefer momentum. We required the door to hear more than money. The Board calls that governance complexity; we call it oxygen made visible.\u201d\n\nHalim did not speak; she shifted her weight in a way that said she had decided to be the person in the room with a conscience and knew exactly how limited the role was. Dr. Yi read the dust numbers in his plain teacher\u2019s voice and they sounded worse than if he had set them to an organ. The nurse described a cough and then a coffin and then a color of fingernail beds, and the judge, whose hair was gray in the manner of a man who had argued with the word for some years and lost, put his pen down in a way that meant he had decided to defy an email he would receive later. He upheld the scope with a clause that would haunt Korr\u2019s future sleep, but it was upheld.\n\nThey were still in the long exhale of that when a noise crawled out of the ceiling at Gate South that made the handler lift his head like a dog who has learned the exact tone of the shoe that hits. The register didn\u2019t bother with politeness. \u201cEmergency advisory,\u201d it said. \u201cOnboard governance requests remote acknowledgement for hazard protocol: habitation pressure variance in ring B; request for human veto to freeze nonessential expansion operations; time to threshold thirteen minutes.\u201d\n\nJune\u2019s skin knew the shape of the next hour before her mind did. Her feet were moving into the verification bay while Korr unrolled a statute like someone rolling pasta. Bram was already telling devices to be more obedient than they wanted to be. Sana sent a blast to the choir that read nothing but the word yes, and the stadium began to fill in the way a bowl fills when you put it under a tap and walk away. Halim removed her hat in the doorway because it was not a church and it was. The judge with the scarf showed up without the scarf and with a running stitch of sweat at his temple.\n\n\u201cProximity,\u201d June said, because there were only so many words the thing would accept as proof of being in the right room. The coin kissed the metal with its tiny sound, the not-key kissed the seam without actually eating, and the register exhaled in acknowledgment of a geometry it had learned.\n\n\u201cOnboard: expansion operation E-19 in ring B initiated; anomaly detected in micropressure management; engineering proposes to proceed; crew safety officer requests freeze; onboard governance requires remote echo,\u201d the not-voice said. It translated the argument with a clinical disgust at its own subject matter.\n\n\u201cWe built the freeze,\u201d Korr said. \u201cWe make the freeze real.\u201d She looked at June in the way a person can look at another person and sit a weight on their shoulders without adding any burden at all. \u201cSay it.\u201d\n\nJune\u2019s hands were new to her. She set them on the edge of the panel and wished, recklessly, that Wren were at her side to make the room do what rooms do when someone who glitters for them wants something. Then she swallowed that wish because lightning often strikes old places in your body and there is only so much bracing a person can do in public. \u201cFreeze nonessential expansion operations,\u201d she said. \u201cPriority is breathing and not dying. Veto exercised by oversight. Will review with human eyes after no one is in danger.\u201d\n\nThe register didn\u2019t like commands without numbers. \u201cQuantify,\u201d it said, petulant as only a large machine can be.\n\n\u201cZero expansion,\u201d Bram said into his device, which had learned to be less coy. \u201cHold E-19 and any siblings with overlapping pressure needs. Shift power to stabilization. Pay down debt to duty constraints before spending on comfort. Do it like a parent pays the heat bill before buying better curtains.\u201d\n\nThe handler\u2019s tablet lit with a message that did not bother to pretend it was for the room. He read and looked up with a face that had learned to be the color of obedience. \u201cThe Chief Engineer says this freeze will cost us two weeks,\u201d he said, and the words were the exact shape of the argument that had killed men across rivers and time.\n\n\u201cThe cost of not freezing is a funeral and a press conference,\u201d Halim said, in the tone of a person who has drafted both. \u201cTwo weeks are cheaper than lungs.\u201d\n\nThe panel hummed its hated acceptance. The stadium\u2019s map flared as a thousand small lights said yes, yes, yes into the mesh. The register said: veto acknowledged; expansion operations in ring B frozen; anomaly review scheduled; human witness present. The words human witness did something to June\u2019s spine that she would not admit to outside a bathroom. She put her forehead briefly against the cool of the panel in the way a person can get away with if she is pretending to smell for ozone.\n\nThey stood very still while numbers did their math on a ship far enough away to make your throat hurt. For a second the room took on the uncanny sensation of being an ear resting on a chest you were not sure would lift. Then the register spoke again, this time with a stiffness that felt like relief trying not to behave like joy. \u201cVariance contained. Crew remains at nominal. Engineering requests rescheduling approval for E-19; onboard governance requests review.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them,\u201d Korr said to June, \u201cthey get their curtains after they show their receipts.\u201d\n\nJune made the sentence a joke because her mouth needed one. \u201cProceed when you can show us it won\u2019t pop a seam,\u201d she said. \u201cSend the maps. Send the reports. Send the apology to the person you scared.\u201d\n\nThe feed from the Ark coughed up a schematic that looked like a child\u2019s toy if you raised a child on graphs. A tiny blip pulsed where a human had stood and said no in a room with air and pressure and the pressure to ignore a human. June touched the screen with the back of her fingers because her father had taught her to test a pan that way and because skin is a better sensor than pride. \u201cWho is the safety officer,\u201d she asked, because names survive drills; she had promised that to herself and to a version of someone who had not gotten to finish a sentence.\n\nThe handler squinted at tiny type that hated being read by eyes. \u201cLt. D\u00e1nae Morales,\u201d he said. \u201cRing B, shift alpha.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her she keeps her job,\u201d June said. \u201cAnd give her mine when I die.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a legal sentence,\u201d Korr said, grinning because it was the first grin June had given herself permission to make.\n\nWhen they came back up into ordinary daylight, the stadium was louder and softer, if that combination can exist. The choir had found a beat with sticks on the seats and the echo of the rhythm folded around the concrete like foil around fire. Children were asleep on jackets. Men who had never learned to be useful in public without shouting sat on their hands. The pastor with the committee God stood on a step and didn\u2019t speak because the room didn\u2019t need him to. June, stepping into it, felt the twin of the emotion she had felt under the panel: that she was inside an ear and the heart underneath had not been convinced to stop.\n\nHer aunt was there, as if a bus had picked her up on the other side of the city and dropped her without stopping. She wore her sweater that had decided not to advertise its holes. Her hair had been a bird\u2019s nest for years and no scolding had domesticated it. \u201cYou looked like your father holding a board he hasn\u2019t sanded yet,\u201d she said, hugging June hard in the place ribs go when a certain kind of love makes demands. \u201cYou stand mean when you\u2019re busy not falling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not mean,\u201d June said, and put her face in her aunt\u2019s shoulder and smelled whatever soap had become family and gave herself thirty seconds to be a person who hadn\u2019t built new verbs.\n\n\u201cYou are something that remembers it used to be sharp,\u201d her aunt said. She looked at the stadium and then at the sky, where a smear of cloud was trying out a costume. \u201cWe saved them, you know. Somewhere up there, a person sat down on a floor after a meeting and thought, \u2018I didn\u2019t have to go to a funeral today,\u2019 and later they will remember that it was because a woman put her head against a machine and told it to wait.\u201d\n\nSomewhere in the pocket of her jacket, the coin decided to remind her it was there by making a weight on her rib she could feel when she breathed. She took it out because ritual now lived in objects, and she pressed it into her aunt\u2019s palm and said, \u201cHold this while I remember I\u2019m not a job.\u201d\n\nHer aunt closed her hand and nodded as if she had been waiting twenty-six years for a niece to ask her to hold something that wasn\u2019t light. \u201cI will sit with it,\u201d she said, and sat, and the coin had the good sense not to fall off her knee.\n\nThe Board, who hated improvisation, issued a press statement with the word collaborative in three forms. Halim edited it until it sounded like someone who had seen a human face recently. The handler went home, which felt like forgiveness if you were generous. Korr drank something out of her torpedo that June suspected was tea and power. Bram put his head down on the table in the way a person does when the body asks to be horizontal without making a bed. Sana gathered kids and taught them a chant that had the words duty and party in it because those words shouldn\u2019t have to live in different parts of the city.\n\nNight rose, as it always does, with little ambition and great conviction. June walked home by a route that she had chosen not because it was the safest but because it passed three places where she had been happy and she wanted to test the hypothesis that memory was a kind of armor. She went by the bridge where the cables had vibrated with their song. She went by the mural of a river that locals always corrected with jokes and never with paint. She went past the window where Wren had once turned her head to watch June cross the street and had waved, small, like a person who did not intend to be the person she became in later drafts. She went up the stairs because the elevator carried signs warning of a felt hat upstairs, and she unlocked the door to the apartment that had learned to accept long silences as evidence of life.\n\nInside, the brush waited like a habit that could not be offended. She picked it up and drew a line on the back of her left hand and then pressed the not-key to it and felt the cool calibrate, the way a machine presses itself against skin to measure a person\u2019s baseline without knowing whether it\u2019s taking a pulse or a vote. The letter on the table had advanced itself a fraction, nosing its next page out like a cat. June unfolded it by degrees, allowing for the possibility of disobedience, and read without bracing because bracing had started to do her harm.\n\nIt said: you will be tempted to become the person they drafted with words and coins\u2014capable of standing in one place and making a room stop with a sentence. That person is useful and that person is a kind of grave. It said: you will be beloved by strangers for being able to say no to a machine. It said: do not start believing you are the only person who can. Make of yourself a bridge that knows how to become invisible once people begin to cross. It said: there will come a day when you are asked to sign permission for something terrible and necessary and you will do it because you are already an accomplice to the structure that requires it. It said: do it with a hand that shakes and then go find a tree and touch it until your body remembers what a sentence is for.\n\nJune left the page open and went to the sink and washed the mud from under her fingernails because there are only so many times you get to make a joke out of hygiene before the joke returns as disease. She put the coin back where the dresser would remember it and the not-key under the pillow because some rituals learned to be honest. She put the chisel on the table and set a lemon next to it and laughed gently at herself until the sound ran out.\n\nIn her sleep she dreamed it was twenty weeks later. She dreamed she was in a room that looked like a classroom until you noticed it had no walls and that the chalk had learned light. She dreamed the dust arrived like an argument and the first Plat said, No, and then said, Stop, and then said nothing because the machine had accepted one of the old words and frozen in mid-sentence. She dreamed the room on the ship had windows that looked like the mouths of fish. She dreamed Wren sat on the floor and tied her shoes with care and did not look up when June came in, because that is the kind of politeness ghosts learn, and June sat down and tied them again, tighter, and neither of them said I\u2019m sorry out loud because some apologies are meant to be lied on like quilts and not recited like prayers.\n\nAt noon the next day, Halim stood at her door without a hat, carrying a bag of pomegranates. It was the kind of fruit media teams issue when they want to make something look festive and ancient at once. \u201cThe liaison is off-duty,\u201d she said, handing the bag over and entering without being invited because this is what strangers can do when they stop being strangers. \u201cI brought you an irritant that would rather stain your fingers than your conscience.\u201d\n\nJune cut one open with a knife that had cut other truths and tapped the seeds out patiently over a bowl with the butt of a spoon until it looked like she was making a case. \u201cYou looked human on television last night,\u201d she said, and Halim laughed since compliments like that are a kind of insult.\n\n\u201cMy mother called to tell me to stop making my hair look political,\u201d Halim said, seating herself at the table with the grace of someone who has learned to carry shame and put it down like a purse. \u201cMy daughter texted me six pictures of your stadium because she believes in whatever that was. I told her it was us learning to be complicated in public.\u201d\n\nThey ate with their fingers and then licked them because pomegranates reward you for behaving like an animal. Halim looked around the apartment in the way a person\u2019s eyes do when they are making a map of a place they will need to return to in their head when their job accuses them of a crime called deciding to prefer human beings. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be asked to go somewhere their cameras love and say something they hate and then smile at someone who hates you in a professional way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will be asked to be nicer. You will be asked to be firmer. You will be asked to make it look like we agree. Don\u2019t. We can\u2019t afford to look like we agree.\u201d\n\nJune nodded and felt the odd, embarrassing love she had developed for this woman who had been an emblem and then a person. \u201cYou know we glued the ship to the river,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI smelled it,\u201d Halim said. \u201cThe first time the panel woke up after, the air forgot to be sterile and remembered it was an atmosphere. It felt like an apology from a building that had thought it was better than us.\u201d\n\nAfternoon brought a new docket and a new set of enemies and a new set of allies who were tired in different ways. The Board\u2019s \u201cconstructive debrief\u201d moved to a room with fewer glass walls and more expensive water. The Commission issued a bulletin that read like a legal poem explaining why the ship had a mud seam in its brain. The riders posted a route for a supply run to a clinic that had been left out of the Board\u2019s distribution because the Board believed efficiency meant helping only neighborhoods that could spell keywords. The pastor hosted an argument that was actually a concert.\n\nJune spent an hour in the sim chair because her hand itched and because practice is the only antidote she knew for a certain kind of pride. She flew Approach Twelve with dust modeled by a boy in a black T-shirt who had been nineteen for ten years. She learned where the wind lied to the instruments and where it only lied to the pilot. She taught her hands how to pull back in a way that would not turn a caution into a catastrophe. Dr. Yi watched without making sounds because joy would betray the seriousness of a thing that would be called, later, a miracle of planning, and the headline would forget that miracles smell like sweat.\n\nAt dusk her aunt sent a video of three kids in a kitchen counting breaths without knowing they were doing math. The judge with the scarf sent a picture of his dog asleep under a chair with one paw in the air as if registering a vote. Korr sent the line she had drafted for a future fight: this ship does not belong to the company that built it; it belongs to the people who will have to survive inside it, and those who will have to live with their decisions. Bram sent a link to a song someone had made out of the register\u2019s phrase\u2014recognition-proxy accepted\u2014and it was not good and June loved it.\n\nWhen sleep came, it came with the old trick of putting her on a bus in a city that did not exist and having her miss her stop. She woke in the rusted end of that and reached for the coin out of habit and found it was exactly where she had left it. She slept again and dreamed that under the panel, the mud had dried into a fissure that letters could crawl into and hide. In the morning she lifted the pillow and checked for the not-key and felt foolish and comforted because it was there and cold and patient.\n\nAt court, at Gate South, at the stadium, in kitchens, in a ring on a ship with a pressure variance that would become a fact only in memoirs, the work continued because it had to and because stopping for applause is a habit reserved for their enemies. June sat with her body and listened for the weather and did not wait for permission. On a screen she could not see, a person named D\u00e1nae Morales filled out a report that used the word stop without a flinch. In a house June had not been in since she was young enough to take naps in the car on the way there, her aunt put the coin in the freezer for an hour because she decided it needed to learn what cold felt like in a room that belonged to someone with rent due.\n\nWhen the first week after launch ended, the city had learned a new choreography. It crossed streets with its head up. It brought food to rooms without being asked and took chairs away when it was time to dance. It learned that a door that listens is not a door you can talk to once and leave. It learned that mud dries into law. It learned to pronounce a name with the care you give a match in wind. It learned the limits of its kindness and then went out and found more. June stood at her window with the brush in her hand and no color on it at all and thought: we are going to fail in public now, and she felt something inside her relax because that, at last, was honesty.",
