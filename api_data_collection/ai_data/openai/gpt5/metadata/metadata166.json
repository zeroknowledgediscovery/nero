     "novel_text": "Cornelius liked to sit on the hill at Laurel Acres Park and count the planes moving across the dusk. They made a gentle, stuttering line toward the northeast, a strand of slow beads pulled by a quiet string. The geese gathered like parentheses by the water. The park had the smell he always connected with Mount Laurel after rain\u2014wet pavement and red clay, the faint sugar of decaying leaves even in spring, a ribbon of car exhaust from Church Street. And the benches had a complaint to them when you sat down, the boards making a noise he could feel in his teeth. He took off his shoes because the grass felt like the old carpeting in his grandmother\u2019s hallway, flat and cool and slightly matted where people always walked.\n\nHe was not alone, though he had trained himself to look that way\u2014chin down, hoodie up, quiet. He carried the ghost of a grocery list in one pocket and the parking lot grit of Wawa in the cuffs of his jeans. He had the awkward hands of someone who had worked in the same big-box store for more years than made sense and could close his eyes and count out twenty bolts by weight. He turned his phone over and over, watched the screen glow, then blacken. He liked the feeling of predicting when the next plane would appear before it did, counting down from five in his head and then seeing that small silver wedge. Only when he reached one with nothing in the sky did he let himself shift, let himself breathe deeper. The world was a test; he wanted a high score.\n\n\u201cCorny,\u201d someone called, and the name slid down the hill like a marble.\n\nHe looked up. The wind pressed the hood to the shape of his head for a second, and in that moment he recognized the outline of a person he had met exactly once in a parking lot off Route 38. Yellow hoodie, hair too long for a job interview, that fragile balance between handsome and tired. Julian. He stopped at the top of the hill, weighed something in the glassy eyes that looked like his father\u2019s, then put his hands in his pockets and came down with a careful side-step that said: I fall if I go straight, so I do this instead.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to call me that,\u201d Cornelius said, smiling anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the brochure. Mount Laurel, the hill park, Wawa coffee, calling you Corny to see you wince. You\u2019re like a local delicacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you just get here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOr we always lived here and didn\u2019t notice before, I can\u2019t decide.\u201d\n\nHis hands were clean. That was the first thing Cornelius always noticed about people, which made no sense. He worked around little bags of hardware and plastic wrap and sharpies and packing tape. Marks were normal. Julian\u2019s nails were clean, the palms unscuffed. It meant something. Or nothing at all.\n\n\u201cMom told me you\u2019d be here,\u201d Julian said, and the word made a shape in the air\u2014Mom\u2014that didn\u2019t fit right yet. His mother, Elaine, had laughed while stirring pasta earlier, one hand on the phone, one at the pot. \u201cHe goes there whenever he wants to think. He says he\u2019s not thinking, but you can tell.\u201d\n\nIt still felt strange, the future tense of family. Elaine was engaged to Rick, who had a son, who had a voice that was warm like toast. Cornelius had spent the afternoon pushing a flatbed cart of lamps down an aisle beneath lights that hummed like a beehive and thinking: Step-brother is a word people use in jokes. Step-brother is a job I don\u2019t know how to do. And here was the person who would make the word real.\n\nJulian dropped down beside him on the hill. They sat like two pegs in a board, not touching and not talking for a time that could have been five minutes or fifteen; Cornelius always lost sense of time at Laurel Acres. The lake made the sound of slow conversation. Across the way, a child threw bread at the geese and the geese did not care for it.\n\n\u201cHow was work?\u201d Julian asked.\n\n\u201cThe bolts were weighing less than they should.\u201d Cornelius grinned because he knew it sounded like a complaint from someone\u2019s great-uncle. \u201cNew supplier. You can tell if you hold them in two hands. The little ones, not the lag bolts. They\u2019re cheap.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a thing you can tell. Good to have a hobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a hobby. It\u2019s a talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, sorry. Your supernatural gift.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me. It\u2019s suburban telekinesis.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd useful,\u201d Julian said. \u201cYou\u2019re a quality control superhero. QC-Man. The cape has a measuring tape hem.\u201d\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have liked the conversation, and he did. He shouldn\u2019t have liked the way the sunset assembled itself in the little crease at the corner of Julian\u2019s mouth or the way he kept tapping his knee as if counting something out that he was embarrassed to admit. He\u2019d made a habit of not wanting people he had to be around. He was good at that. And yet he remembered how they had met in the Wawa parking lot, how Julian had offered him a sip of hazelnut milkshake blended with actual coffee while their parents went inside to look at wedding magazines and found the birthday card section anyway, which was always how that went. They had stood by the recycling bin and watched a giant pickup try, fail, try, succeed to back into a spot. Julian had said, \u201cI flinch for other people,\u201d and then the straw had been pressed toward Cornelius\u2019s mouth in a way that was not aggressive but also not tentative. This, he discovered, was one of the qualities he recognized in people he would have to leave: knowing exactly where to put things in other people\u2019s space and pretending they were unsure.\n\n\u201cElaine told me you like to cook,\u201d Julian said now. \u201cShe said you once made pancakes in the shapes of states.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to cook. I like to pretend I know things.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you know what, Maine? Michigan? People always try to do Texas because it\u2019s big, but the bottom part is tricky.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be tested on it,\u201d he said, and then: \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to ask if Julian called Rick \u201cDad,\u201d and then he realized there was no way to do that without sounding accusatory. He wanted to ask about Philadelphia, where Julian had been living up until last month, what made him decide to come back across the bridge at an age when most people were trying to go the other way. He wanted to ask if he believed he could start over, because Cornelius didn\u2019t, not really, except in increments so small you could mistake them for error margins. He didn\u2019t ask any of it. He watched a plane descend and meant to follow it to the ground but got distracted by a toddler in a dragon hoodie. When he looked back, the plane had vanished. A bead had gone missing. He felt suddenly anxious, as if he had misplaced an earring.\n\n\u201cI forgot to bring the thing,\u201d Julian said abruptly, as if they had had a whole conversation about a thing. \u201cI was gonna bring that book I told you about. About the guy who does repairs but also he reads buildings like people read tarot cards? The author\u2019s from here. Or Cherry Hill. That counts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can read bolts,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll like it. I\u2019ll leave it at your\u2014\u201d He caught himself, looked at the river of cars on the road beyond the park. \u201cAt Elaine\u2019s.\u201d\n\nCornelius almost corrected him. It isn\u2019t just Elaine\u2019s anymore; it\u2019s a shared house with a wall that squeaks when you lean on it and a hall light that goes out at inconvenient times and the smell of lemon cleaner even in the places you can\u2019t see. One of the funny things about a house is how it develops a social life after midnight: it shifts and knocks and breathes and calls your name in the heating vents. His room at the top of the stairs had started to say \u201cCorn\u201d\u2014just the first half, like the first tug on a sleeve.\n\nHe squinted at the lake. A couple in matching windbreakers argued in a soft way near the edge of the path. A boy\u2019s voice came from behind him and called, \u201cMae, where\u2019d you put my phone?\u201d and a woman replied, \u201cOn the bench, baby,\u201d and when Cornelius turned to look he found no one there, only the top of the hill and the wind compressing the grass into a single stripe. He did not find this strange, but then he often had a radio quality in his head\u2014people tuning in and out. He\u2019d assumed it was the kind of noise everyone had, like when you hear your name in a conversation you weren\u2019t part of. He shook it. The distant girl who called herself Mae laughed again, higher, and then she was gone.\n\n\u201cDo you remember,\u201d he asked without thinking, \u201cthe last time you fell in love?\u201d\n\nJulian glanced at him sideways and then pretended a plane was very interesting. \u201cNot a great opening question.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an opening. We\u2019ve met.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou act like I\u2019m a book you checked out and got a fine for. Yeah,\u201d he said, after a small pause that had the weight of months in it. He nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how did you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t. Not the way they tell you. It wasn\u2019t like bells. It was like waking up on the wrong couch and smelling oranges and then realizing you\u2019re wearing someone else\u2019s socks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds like bells to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you the socks,\u201d Julian said, and then laughed. \u201cNo, don\u2019t look like that. It\u2019s not dirty.\u201d\n\nHe was careful enough to say \u201clove\u201d as a topic but not as an arrow, so Cornelius\u2019s skin did not prick all over. He liked that. He liked the way Julian sat with his knees turned in slightly, his feet pressed to the ground as if the earth might, at any second, discard him.\n\nThey left before the park lights blinked on. Julian was not from Mount Laurel, not the way Cornelius was, but he had that built-in county geography all the same: he could navigate the chopped-up roads and the old joints and the way a U-turn here put you into a jughandle you didn\u2019t plan to take. They walked past a teenage couple crawling over each other on the hill and then past a man in a bright neon vest throwing a Frisbee to a dog that was clearly in retirement from Frisbee. Cornelius felt everything. He felt the pinch of his socks between his toes. He felt the coin in his pocket press a perfect circle against his thigh. He felt the muscles at the back of his neck tighten and then relax because a sound he could not identify had resolved into a train. He wanted, with blunt suddenness, to tell Julian that he was tired\u2014tired of small newnesses, tired of being in transitional spaces, tired of being watched by things that had no eyes.\n\nAt the parking lot, Julian took out his keys and fumbled them, catching them by their lanyard. \u201cI\u2019m staying tonight at the house,\u201d he said. \u201cRick\u2019s got a meeting early. And the cat\u2019s been ignoring me. I need to win Tux back.\u201d\n\n\u201cTux doesn\u2019t ignore. Tux judges.\u201d Tux was a tuxedo cat with a formal walk and an unamused mouth. She had arrived with Elaine\u2019s friend Mr. Dwyer and never left. Sometimes Mr. Dwyer still called to ask how \u201cmy daughter\u201d was doing, as if he had mislaid her in a grocery store. He showed up with casserole and advice about weather-proofing bathtubs. He installed one towel rack and then wrote a note in Sharpie on the inside of the cabinet door to remind them not to hang wet things on it.\n\n\u201cYou like my dad?\u201d Julian asked as they reached his car.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He is. He has a way of being in a room.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean to do the\u2026you know.\u201d He lifted a shoulder. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to sit in quiet places. Or he thinks the quiet will tell him something about him he doesn\u2019t want to hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be family,\u201d Cornelius said, trying out the muscles around the word. \u201cThere are worse things than someone who means well.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike someone who knows better,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cBut would rather not.\u201d\n\nHe found himself making boxes in his head and fitting pieces into them: Julian\u2019s laugh, the way he did not always look at you. The way he stood half-turned. The freckles that had escaped a plan. He put these into the box labeled Dangerous, which in his internal taxonomy often overlapped with the box labeled Fine.\n\nAt home the house smelled like lemon cleaner and tomato sauce and a thread of shampoo that had got itself lost downstairs. Elaine stood by the stove, banging a wooden spoon against a jar as if it were a bell in a church no one attended anymore. Rick\u2019s suit jacket hung over the back of a chair, empty of him. The corner of the table had a new chip. Tux walked past them like a rumor and leapt onto the counter. From the living room came the low voice of a newscaster saying a thing that made no impact and then a commercial for a regional jewelry store that had always advertised in this region and always would. Mr. Dwyer, who had a key and a habit of being there, sat on the couch with his legs crossed and a crossword in his lap. He did not look up, but he said, \u201cFour-letter word for your mother\u2019s firstborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d Cornelius said, walking past and feeling, as he always did, that he was stepping into a photograph he had already seen. He put his hand on Elaine\u2019s shoulder. She leaned into it like a plant.\n\n\u201cI meant \u2018Eldest,\u2019\u201d Mr. Dwyer muttered. \u201cNot that it would fit. Whose idea was this grid?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Rick,\u201d Julian called as their father\u2014his father\u2014came down the stairs. They didn\u2019t look alike. Rick had the florid complexion of a person who liked to tell stories into the chest cavity of a beer bottle. He crowded a room. He had a laughter that made you feel praised. He had a habit of making every day into the day before a big game.\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d he said, and his voice filled the kitchen. He kissed Elaine on the mouth, then drew back and wiped his own mouth with a napkin because of the sauce, then gave her a look that said: I know you hate when I do that. \u201cNew lamp came today, Cornelius. We\u2019ll fix that flicker.\u201d\n\nCornelius found himself nodding, as if the flicker were a person he had promised to meet. He had been the unofficial maintenance person in the house since he was seventeen and the sink had first made a noise like someone drinking too loudly. He was twenty-nine now. It was hard to remember a time before the sink had opinions.\n\n\u201cGo wash your hands,\u201d Elaine said. \u201cI learned last week that apparently grease can come out of towels with club soda. Who knew?\u201d\n\nMr. Dwyer raised his pencil. \u201cMy mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got your mother,\u201d Elaine said. \u201cAnd neither do I.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one knows club soda this way,\u201d Mr. Dwyer said, and then he looked at Cornelius for the first time. His eyes did this thing sometimes where they didn\u2019t focus correctly but still expressed warmth. He blinked, slow. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not dinner if you\u2019re not yelling at me for time,\u201d Cornelius said, and Mr. Dwyer\u2019s mouth softened, as if he were pleased to be part of a pattern.\n\nThey ate. They always ate with a formality that surprised people who came to the house for the first time. Elaine lit candles. Even when there was spaghetti. Even when there were just grilled cheese sandwiches. It was her cathedral, the table, and she cleaned the candleholders once a week as if devils lived in wax. Cornelius could tell you which fork was his by feel. Rick told a story about a client who had not known how to say the word \u201cescrow\u201d and would never learn it. Mr. Dwyer complained that his crossword had doubled in difficulty over the last six months; either that or his brain had halved. Julian contributed a remark about a busker on 13th Street whose horse was a unicycle, then got embarrassed, and then leaned over to scoop sauce onto his plate. The unicycle\u2019s horse was all Cornelius could picture now. He saw it in the reflection in the microwave door. He didn\u2019t know if he was present or absent from his life at any given moment. On his good days he could fake it. On his bad days you could see the absence around him like a halo.\n\nElaine said, \u201cCornelius is thinking,\u201d and Mr. Dwyer put his pencil down and said, \u201cThat boy needs a patent.\u201d Rick said, \u201cNo, he needs a vacation,\u201d and Julian said, \u201cNo, he needs a\u2014\u201d then stopped, as if he had reached the end of his sentence as a cliff.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t finish,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cLet me guess later and be wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could be right,\u201d Julian said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the point of guessing?\u201d\n\nCornelius finished eating and washed his plate, because if he didn\u2019t rinse it and stack it the way he liked, the plate would dry sauce in a James Pollock design that would never scrub away without noise. He stacked. He wiped. He let the kitchen light make a hum in his eardrum. He listened for Elaine and Rick arguing in their bedroom\u2014the normal kind, the sort that did not require him to walk to his car at eleven and pretend the radio could save him. No. Tonight, the house was mild-tempered. The lemon cleanser hovered without reproach. Tux sat on the back of the couch and made shapes with her tail like italic letters.\n\nIn his room, Cornelius found a paperback on his pillow. The cover had a cutaway drawing of a house, the inside walls exposed, as if someone had peeled it like an orange. A note sat on top of the book, scribbled in blue ink. Look at Chapter 3. It\u2019s the thing about windows. \u2014J.\nThe J looked like it had been started and then gotten interrupted halfway through. The letter had two attempts at a tail.\n\nHe sat on the edge of the bed. The bed squeaked in a way that made his stomach compress. He pressed his palm into the duvet to make it stop. He opened the book. Chapter 3 had a little rust mark from a paperclip someone had lost, but no paperclip. The first sentence read, Some houses wear faces they found in other neighborhoods. He smiled. He wanted to hold the sentence in both hands the way Julian had held the keys. He closed the book and put it on his nightstand and told himself not to read more. He went to the window and looked out. He could count three porch lights on the street, two from houses that had existed long enough to get nicknames on the walking routes and one from the new unit at the end where the family had a subscription to a produce service and it came on Tuesdays.\n\nHis phone lit. A message from a contact saved as D. Vale. Tomorrow at 10 still good? I have the room with the plant. The plant may or may not be alive. \nHe wrote back: Yes. I\u2019ll bring a plant funeral kit.\nHe meant to write a follow-up, something about the book, something about being uncomfortable that the plant made him think of himself, but he did not. He put the phone on the bed and then fell asleep with his clothes on and woke an hour later very certain he had had a conversation he could not remember. He looked at his phone to make sure he had not texted anyone a confession or a recipe. The phone did not tell on him. He went back to sleep, and when he woke next he had lines from Chapter 3 in his head as if he had eaten them with his pasta.\n\nThe drive to the office on Church Road took fifteen minutes the next morning. It should have taken seven. He counted the lights to time his breathing and then forgot how many there were. He parked behind a building that had once been a house and was now other things. Inside, the hall smelled like carpet and paper. No music. No receptionist, because D. Vale didn\u2019t believe in them. A waiting room that did not want to be one. A plant that did not want to be alive. He pressed his thumb to a crease in the armrest of a chair and it came away with dust in it.\n\n\u201cCornelius,\u201d Dr. Vale said, coming from the back. They held a mug and had a face that suggested they never got enough sleep because they were eavesdropping on the neighbors\u2019 dreams. They had a way of making you feel that your name was someone else\u2019s name and you were using it while the other person was at lunch. He stood. They made a small show of looking at the plant. \u201cYou win. It\u2019s dead. No amount of water changes what is essentially a succulent\u2019s headstone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI forgot the funeral kit,\u201d he said, smiling because he wanted to.\n\n\u201cYou brought yourself. Good enough for my purposes.\u201d\n\nThe room had one window. The window had a blind that worked only when you pressed it exactly in the place where someone had before. He sat in the chair with the notch that fit his shoulder blade. Dr. Vale sat across and threw their leg over their knee and let their shoulders slouch in a way that made him condition his own to respond. He thought of the word \u201csplay,\u201d and then he thought of the word \u201csprawl,\u201d and then he realized he was rearranging the letters to make a new person. He stopped. He did not like to be caught rearranging.\n\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d Dr. Vale asked.\n\n\u201cI counted planes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny crashes?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he said, quietly.\n\n\u201cSorry. My mouth moves before my good judgment. Tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met him at the park,\u201d he said, and when Dr. Vale tilted their head he added, \u201cJulian. Rick\u2019s son.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a paper cup. Smooth and cheap and a little soft.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can work with that metaphor,\u201d they said, and wrote nothing down. He\u2019d never seen them write anything down. He didn\u2019t know if they remembered or if the point was to make a life that did not require notes.\n\n\u201cHe was kind. He asked questions. He didn\u2019t try to win. He had a story about unicycles,\u201d Cornelius said, and heard a small laugh come out of his own throat because the absurdity made a shape in the room that was better than the plant. \u201cHe brought me a book.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like him,\u201d Dr. Vale said, as if they had already been there with him.\n\n\u201cYou like that I like him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like that you like anyone,\u201d they said. \u201cAre you telling him?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout liking?\u201d He felt a needle prick inside. He found himself looking at the window, calculating if someone outside could see his mouth. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout any of it.\u201d\n\nThis was their shorthand. This could mean different things on different days. Today it meant: Are you telling him about why the ends of your sentences sometimes come with static? Are you telling him about the way you lose pieces of your week? Are you telling him about the names you find in your pockets that you don\u2019t recognize in your handwriting? It also meant: Are you telling him you were in love with a person once who never heard you say it?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know enough to tell anything,\u201d he said.\n\nThey nodded. \u201cIs it like the book? Can you read him like bolts?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s heavy enough,\u201d Cornelius said. He pressed his thumb to the chair\u2019s notch. He thought of the \u201csomeone else\u201d in the note on his pillow. Not someone else; that had been in his head. He thought of the way the geese had refused bread. \u201cThere\u2019s a singer. He mentioned a singer in Philly, or a band, and I thought that he\u2026I don\u2019t know. It was nothing. I have thoughts that are just air for a living.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about Mae?\u201d they asked, casually.\n\nHe blinked. The name dropped like a penny into a fountain, made a delicate plop. \u201cMae?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mentioned her last week. The person at the coffee place who knows to put extra sugar in your tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Cornelius said, with the relief of someone who had misplaced their wallet and then found it in their other coat. \u201cShe\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mr. Dwyer?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was doing a crossword on our couch.\u201d He felt, for a second, a tug at the back of his head, as if someone was pulling a string out of his scalp. He pressed his palm flat. \u201cHe asked for a four-letter word for firstborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your father?\u201d\n\nHe made a face. \u201cHe walked into the kitchen and made a mess of the way the light works.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me one small thing that is not about someone else,\u201d they said. It had the air of an assignment. He looked at his hands. He looked at the plant. He looked at the cup in Dr. Vale\u2019s hand and the line their mouth made when they sipped.\n\n\u201cI like that the hill at Laurel Acres is cut wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good hill. It humps and then slopes like it\u2019s tired in the middle. It doesn\u2019t belong here. The rest of the park is so\u2026\u201d He gestured with his hand to indicate something like \u201cmade by a committee,\u201d then laughed softly. \u201cI like that it\u2019s wrong. That makes it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d they said, and their voice did something like turning a light on. \u201cKeep that. Practice liking things that are wrong.\u201d\n\nHe left feeling lighter and then heavy. He wanted to cry. He wanted to eat a bagel. He wanted to find the person whose phone voice had called out for Mae and tell them that everything they wanted was already inside their pockets and they just had the wrong coat on. He drove to the store and let the fluorescent lights smear everything into one substance. He counted screws. He sorted a bin of washers by diameter and found satisfaction there that he could not find in any human face. He took lunch in the back room and found a note in his lunch bag in handwriting that looked a little like his own but too neat, too careful. Good boy. Eat the apple. \u2014M.\nHe looked around the break room. Dina sat at the far table, talking to someone he could not see; her hand moved in the air as if she were swatting a fly. Sonia came in and then came back out, as if she had committed and then uncommitted to something. A man in a neon vest stood by the vending machine and the machine rejected him by blinking every black light at once. Cornelius folded the note and put it in his wallet behind a picture of the hill at Laurel Acres that he\u2019d taken one fall when it had looked particularly convincing.\n\nHe thought, briefly, to text Julian. He thought, I could say: I saw the unicycle horse on the news. He thought, I could say: I read Chapter 3. He thought, I could say: Do you like bagels with salt? He did none of these. He ate the apple. He threw the core away and then took it back out and laid it on a napkin because he couldn\u2019t bear it face down in a circle of lettuce. The day moved like a body in pain that no one knew how to handle.\n\nAfter work he drove down a side street he didn\u2019t know he knew. The houses on that street looked like a row of people holding their breath. A woman on a porch yelled, \u201cMae!\u201d and a cat stood up on its hind legs and put its paw against the screen door and said nothing. He parked and sat in his car and did the thing where you put your forehead to the steering wheel and do not cry and do not cry and then breathe and pretend you did. He went home.\n\nThe book on his pillow had a pink sticky note now that read: Sad windows are a you thing. Discuss. \u2014J.\nHe laughed and then didn\u2019t. He went downstairs and found Julian on the floor with Tux, who had her head tipped back to stare into his eyes. They were having a conversation, clear as any other, and Cornelius had the feeling he was a third person in a room where two had already decided to be friends.\n\n\u201cDo you want to go to a show?\u201d Julian asked without preamble when he walked in. \u201cI mean later. Not tonight. There\u2019s a place in Haddonfield, or Haddon Heights, something with an H, anyway there\u2019s this singer\u2014Rowan? Rowan something. They have this way of making even the stupidest line feel like a truth you can sleep on without back pain.\u201d\n\nCornelius put an apple back in the fruit bowl and then took the apple back out because it had touched the lip of the bowl and he had the idea the apple and the lip did not like each other. \u201cSure,\u201d he said, and it came out like he had rehearsed it. He hadn\u2019t, but his mouth was good at pretending. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to invite me to things because of the upcoming\u2014\u201d He waggled his hands. \u201cFamily.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Julian said, and his face settled into a seriousness that made him look older. \u201cI want to. I\u2019m not good at\u2026you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d Cornelius said.\n\n\u201cI talk too much and then not at all. I disappear at weddings.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood skill,\u201d Cornelius said, and felt his throat loosen. \u201cI disappear at the dentist.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight in the chair?\u201d\n\n\u201cPoof.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re something,\u201d Julian said. \u201cI mean that in a way that\u2019s not an insult.\u201d\n\nThey leaned against opposite sides of the doorway and let the silence gather. Cornelius could hear Elaine upstairs running water, running it twice, the second time longer than was necessary. He could hear the traffic on the street, a staccato. He could hear Mr. Dwyer\u2019s key in the lock, then not, then the sound of it dropping to the porch and a soft curse and then the key in the lock again. He could hear his name spoken in the corner of the room in a voice that had once belonged to his grandmother. He turned his head. The corner was empty but the voice had the shape of dust in it, and he wiped it off with his hand. He did this almost without thinking. He did so many things between thinking.\n\nThat night they went out for ice cream and sat in the car at the edge of the strip mall because it was raining and the tables outside were slick with a thin film that made them look like they had been glazed. Julian talked about a job that might have been offered to him and might not. Cornelius ate his chocolate slowly, letting it melt and then taking it back. A group of teenagers sprinted past and then sprinted back again in a loop like they had been wound by a key. The neon sign in the pizza place next door flickered and held. The rain came down at a slant that made it seem like the sky had started to tilt.\n\n\u201cDo you want to get out of here?\u201d Julian asked, and then clarified, embarrassed, \u201cI mean the parking lot. Not the town. Not your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere would we go.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaurel Acres,\u201d Julian said, and laughed at himself. \u201cWe\u2019re those people now.\u201d\n\nThey went. They sat in the car at the top of the hill and watched the slick citizens of the park move through each other's reflections. The rain made pools in the places the hill sank. In the rearview mirror, Cornelius could see his own face. It looked better there than in the bathroom at home. He decided never to look at his face except in reflective surfaces he couldn\u2019t control.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d Julian said, pointing at a particular tree, its leaves heavy, its trunk dark. \u201cThat\u2019s a good tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand trees,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cI mean, I get them. But I don\u2019t understand when people say one is better than another.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis one knows the right words. Look at it.\u201d Julian leaned forward and his hair stuck to his forehead. He made a small noise of frustration like a kettle just before it whistles. He turned and looked at Cornelius as if someone had told him to find a thing he would miss when he lost it.\n\nThey did not touch. The car was fully human: it made noises in its own body and suffered and grew older with them. Cornelius wanted to put his hand on the back of Julian\u2019s hand, then imagined what that hand would feel like in the hours afterward\u2014how the skin would carry the memory like chalk. He wanted a new alphabet for this thing. He wanted to know what percentage of himself he could spend before he was poor.\n\n\u201cTell me a secret,\u201d Julian said. It was not a dare.\n\n\u201cI put the apple core on a napkin,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is to the trash.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember Tuesday,\u201d Cornelius said, and then, because the car felt like the kind of room you could chat with about your failures, he added, \u201cI went to work. I have moments from it. I know there was a piece of paper in my pocket when I took my jeans off that had a phone number for someone I don\u2019t know and the name \u2018Mae\u2019 written in the top corner and I tore it up because I don\u2019t like what it feels like when you keep a thing that doesn\u2019t know how to be kept.\u201d\n\nJulian looked at him. He was very still. The rain rattled the roof of the car like applause. \u201cI forget, too,\u201d he said, finally. \u201cBut when I forget it\u2019s because I want to. You sound like you forget like the town gets fog.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a movie,\u201d Cornelius said, and he had to say it, had to hurry. \u201cIt\u2019s not dramatic. It\u2019s just like you put down a glass and then you\u2019re sure you didn\u2019t, and then you don\u2019t go looking for it because you\u2019re embarrassed to have lost a glass. It\u2019s like that, over and over. Small kindnesses you don\u2019t do for yourself anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you tell Dr. Vale?\u201d\n\nHe smiled at the windshield. \u201cThey know. They operated on me last year and took out the part of me that remembered Tuesdays.\u201d\n\nJulian did not accept this joke. \u201cDo you\u2026are you scared?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always scared. I think that\u2019s the base note. It\u2019s just that sometimes there\u2019s harmony and I can\u2019t tell where it\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Julian said. And it was a thing to say. It was something to put into the glove compartment and carry around for a while. Cornelius felt the words like a new penny he didn\u2019t want to spend. He put his fingertips on the ridge of the glove compartment for a second, then pulled them away like it was a person\u2019s cheek he should not have touched.\n\n\u201cDo you want to come tomorrow,\u201d Julian said, \u201cto the place with the singer? Rowan? The H towns? We\u2019ll get lost and then unlost and then pretend we meant to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Cornelius said, and it fit.\n\nWhen he went to bed, he found a new note. Coffee before the road? Meet me at the Wawa on 73, 5:30. I\u2019ll be the one with the two coffees and the look of betrayal if you don\u2019t come. \u2014J.\nHe sat on the edge of the bed and held the note and felt too old for this and too young and exactly right at the same time. He put the note under the book. He undressed in the dark, as he did when he didn\u2019t want to see the history his body had written in dabs and scrapes and small computers of pain. He lay down and slept a heavy sleep that was not a sleep but a sink.\n\nHe woke at three to the sound of someone washing dishes in his kitchen and went downstairs and found the sink empty and his hands wet.\n\nHe dried them and went back to bed. He told himself that in the morning he would be rational and put every thing in a bin and label it and see that nothing was moving when he looked away. He put the thought in a box. He labeled it with a piece of tape and wrote in his best, careful handwriting: DO NOT OPEN ALONE.\n\nIn the morning the Wawa parking lot had that washed-out bluish light that turns every car into the same car and every person into a part of your day you haven\u2019t lived yet. He saw Julian\u2019s yellow hoodie like a flag put out for an obscure holiday and felt his chest fill with something like the moment you get on a ride at a county fair and decide to trust the bolts. Julian was holding two coffees. He held one out. Cornelius took it and felt the heat and did not wince. He told himself it was good to hold hot things. It was practice.\n\n\u201cYou came,\u201d Julian said, and it was not relief so much as recognition, as if they\u2019d been planning this meeting all their life and had nearly missed it.\n\n\u201cI would always come,\u201d Cornelius said, and then he wondered why he had said that, as if he had started in a different conversation and brought the end of it here.\n\nBehind them, someone called, \u201cMae?\u201d A voice with a shape he knew. He turned. The parking lot was a shuffle of sneakers and a spill of napkins someone hadn\u2019t caught and the dark mouth of the store and the glint of a trash can lid. He saw no Mae. He saw, for a moment, Mr. Dwyer standing by the door with the crossword folded into an origami bird. He looked again and it was not Mr. Dwyer, it was a teenager in a varsity jacket laughing into his phone.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Julian said, and Cornelius nodded and followed him to the car. He put his coffee in the holder that had a crack in it, a hairline that had been there since the beginning of time. He watched Julian\u2019s hand on the gear shift. He watched the rain start again even though the weather had promised it wouldn\u2019t. He watched the town open itself to them like a book with a fold in one page already.\n\nOn Route 73 they found a rhythm. Julian sped up and slowed down in time with the cars in a way that made Cornelius think of schools of fish. They passed the places Cornelius had gone for paper plates and batteries and the places Elaine had gone for wedding things and the place where a florist had told them it was fine to be late, it was always fine, and the place where Mr. Dwyer had shouted into his phone about grout. They passed a giant billboard advertising accident attorneys. They passed a smaller billboard advertising forgiveness. The river was on their left for a while, and then it disappeared like a friend you thought was following you in line.\n\n\u201cYou ever think about leaving?\u201d Julian asked.\n\n\u201cOnly in the daytime,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cAt night I believe in everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when it\u2019s easiest to be fooled.\u201d\n\n\u201cI live there,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cIt\u2019s home.\u201d\n\nJulian laughed, then rubbed his eye with the heel of his hand. \u201cTell me something the hill told you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt said I don\u2019t have to keep any of this,\u201d Cornelius said, and thought: I don\u2019t know if that was the hill or me pretending to be the hill so I can do the thing I want to do and blame the landscape.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep some of it,\u201d Julian said. \u201cNot all of it. Not a collection. Something that fits in your pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a note,\u201d Cornelius said, and then he did not say anymore because they arrived at a red light and a truck next to them made a noise like a flood and he was afraid that if he spoke he would drown himself. He touched the note in his pocket anyway, like a superstition, like a map.\n\nThe show was in a room that used to be a pizza place; you could smell the ghost of cheese. Rowan stood on a little platform and sang into a mic that had been dropped many times, its grill dented like a knuckle. They sang about people who put their fights in jars and stack them in the attic. They sang about a man who walked into the ocean because he thought it owed him an apology. They sang about a house with a floor that sloped so gently you had to lie down on it to understand what was happening to your body. Cornelius stood close enough to the stage to feel the air moved by Rowan\u2019s voice and far enough that he could pretend none of the words were about him.\n\nJulian swayed. He looked more comfortable with music than with conversation. He closed his eyes. He did not let them stay closed; he checked his corners and then closed them again. Cornelius wanted to memorize that motion and then wanted to forget it so he could be surprised again. He wanted things that were not reasonable to want.\n\nAfterwards, they stepped into the alley to breathe and to get away from a man who had told them at least three times that he had been to LA and found it shallow. The alley smelled like garlic and damp and the hope that a cat would appear and solve your problems. Julian tipped his head back and said, \u201cSee? Back pain free.\u201d\n\nCornelius felt sweat on his neck and the little cool scratch of air when a breeze found him. He said, \u201cThe song about the attic,\u201d and Julian said, \u201cYeah,\u201d and that was enough.\n\nWhen he went to pay for their drinks, the woman at the counter said, \u201cYou\u2019re Cornelius,\u201d as if she were introducing him to someone inside himself. She had a name tag that read MAE and a small scar between her eyebrows that made her look like she spent a lot of time thinking hard about unfixable things.\n\n\u201cI guess,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI like your bolts,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do them well.\u201d\n\nHe stared, then realized she was teasing him, except he could not find the crease of a joke on her mouth. He paid. He left a tip that made no sense for the purchase. He went outside. He said nothing to Julian about it. He put the receipt in his pocket and did not look at it later.\n\nOn the drive home, he fell asleep for one long blink and woke to Julian tapping his arm, gently, not the way Rick would have, and saying, \u201cYou know where we\u2019re going,\u201d and he said, \u201cAlways,\u201d and then they were back with the hill in the dark and the house with the lemon smell and the cat who had made a bed of the stack of clean towels. They put their keys on the table in the front hall. His key made a noise. Julian\u2019s key made a more urgent noise. He looked at the notes on the fridge. One was in Elaine\u2019s handwriting: Eggs? Another was in a blocky print he did not immediately recognize: Cornelius\u2014fix the light in the downstairs bathroom. I keep seeing my head in it and it\u2019s not my head. \u2014D.\nHe stood and felt, for a small pinch of time, that the house was full of people standing in the places where he had ever stood. He felt that if he turned too quickly he would collide with himself. He thought of the hill and what it had told him. He thought of the planes, and how easily they vanished when he looked away.\n\nHe went to bed. He did not turn on the lamp. He lay on his side and listened for whatever it was that would tell him he had done something irreversible. He heard nothing. He slept, and in his sleep he walked down a long hallway with the sound of a soft pencil on paper following him, and when he turned around there was no one there, just his own footprints in the wax, and then even those disappeared as if the floor had changed its mind.He woke to a ring of damp on his pillow and the conviction that he had made a promise in his sleep. It lived in his mouth like a coin he\u2019d been holding between his teeth, sour and shiny, unspendable. The house was awake already; it had that mid-morning industry that meant Elaine had taken the day by both sleeves and shaken it. He could hear the vacuum bumping gently into the ottoman, the ottoman offering no apology and no resistance, the vacuum retreating and gathering itself for a second attempt. He lay still long enough to watch the light in the room shift from a flat square to a trapezoid that made a neat shadow of the book on his nightstand, and he thought: sad windows look like this when the day starts misaligned. He reached for the book without looking, opened to the chapter with the paperclip rust mark, and let his eyes snag on a sentence about how glass remembers the people who look into it too often. The sentence had the taste of penny again. He closed the book and put it face-down because he didn't want the room to catch him reading about itself.\n\nOn the refrigerator there were three new notes. One was in Elaine\u2019s round, emphatic hand: Don\u2019t forget Mr. Dwyer\u2019s casserole dish. One was in a thin, precise script he recognized as belonging to the bridal boutique in Marlton where Elaine had put a deposit on a dress that made her look like someone else\u2019s best story: Fitting at 2 p.m., please no lotion. The third was blocky and a little impatient. Cornelius\u2014fix the light in the downstairs bathroom. I keep seeing my head in it and it\u2019s not my head. \u2014D. He held that one between forefinger and thumb and let it lean. He knew the shape of Mr. Dwyer\u2019s D; it was like a front step with a crack in it. He folded the note and put it in his pocket as if that would quiet it and went for the toolbox.\n\nThe downstairs bathroom had the kind of light people mistake for clarity. It was too high, too bright in one quadrant, too dim in the corners. He turned the switch and watched the bulb blink, catch, blink again\u2014a tired eye\u2014then hold. The mirror needed a proper bracket; someone had installed it with a faith in adhesives that bordered on religious. He stood and looked at his head the way you look at an object in a store window you might steal if you weren\u2019t yourself. He saw the slightly wrong tilt of his ears, the hair he had tried and failed to make obey routine, the little nick on his cheek he didn\u2019t remember earning. He tilted his head left. The man in the mirror tilted right, because mirrors are contrary. He lifted his hand and watched his hand rise up on the other side. There was a breath between the two motions, the smallest lag. It might have been in his head. It might have been in the wiring. It might have been the kind of thing some people would call a trick of the light. He leaned closer and thought: who is this, and why is he so committed to my mistakes.\n\nThe screw that held the fixture bent when he tried to coax it; he felt it protest in a whisper that went down his wrist and into his elbow. He took the fixture off anyway because he had the rhythm of removal in his hands; you had to listen for the way the threads wanted to be undone. He saw the wires, one with its cloth fray like a tired sock. He thought of the attic song and the jars. He thought, not for the first time, that the house was a person who had burned their tongue on hot soup very young and never tasted things correctly after that, and he was always trying to describe salt in a way the house could understand. He stripped the end of the wire and retaped it with a neatness that would have pleased Mr. Dwyer if Mr. Dwyer had known to be pleased by the correct application of tape.\n\nWhen he put the fixture back and tested it, the light held; it made the room a little less honest. He looked one more time at the glass. The person there blinked when he did. There was no lag. For a second, relief made him silly, and he said out loud, \u201cYou\u2019re me,\u201d and the mirror did not argue, because no one sensible does when the point is to get through a morning. On his way out he saw Tux in the hallway, consulting the patch of sun as if it had asked to be seen. She tilted her face to him and then back to the light like someone comparing two opinions she didn\u2019t trust.\n\nElaine was at the table, wedding magazines like shallow boats all around her. She had a pencil tucked behind her ear and her hair was up in a knot that had trapped a sensation from three days ago and wouldn\u2019t let it out. \u201cYou fixed it,\u201d she said, and he handed her Mr. Dwyer\u2019s note as proof of request rather than achievement. \u201cHe\u2019ll stop the melodrama now. He keeps telling me that light has a grudge.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d Cornelius said. He put his finger on an image of a cake that had three tiers and a habit of leaning toward the person who didn\u2019t want it. \u201cThis one looks edible.\u201d\n\n\u201cCakes are for photographs,\u201d Elaine said, and then laughed because she knew it sounded like sacrilege. \u201cThank you. And please tell me you are coming to the fitting, because if I have to listen to Rick say the words \u2018meringue bodice\u2019 while I\u2019m in a dressing room, I will forget my own name and never get it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d he said, and he meant it in the way you mean you\u2019ll show up at a place where someone loves you beyond your usefulness. He made a note on the dry-erase board by the back door in his own careful hand, Fitting 2 p.m., then added underneath in small letters, Bring patience, bring water, bring a joke for emergencies.\n\nJulian arrived like a soft wind; the side door knew him now and opened without the alarm complaining. He carried two paper bags and the disappointed mouth of a person whose coffee had not been strong enough but who knew not to blame the coffee. His hair was damp from a shower or from rain; he shook his head once like a dog, saw the magazines, and smiled into them with affection and a little alarm. \u201cI come bearing breakfast,\u201d he said, and then, \u201cI know it\u2019s not breakfast time, but my body is on its own schedule. I have no union representation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s onion bagels in there,\u201d Elaine said, peering into the bag as if it might be a small theater. \u201cBless you and all of your employers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to introduce a new motion,\u201d Julian said. \u201cLet us as a family consider the possibility of approval for the cardigan with elbow patches for Rick. It will give him something to do with all that enthusiasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has four elbows,\u201d Elaine murmured, tearing a bagel with a competence that made Cornelius think of weather maps. \u201cFind the cardigan that allows for that, and I will approve it.\u201d\n\nCornelius had the pleasure of watching the two of them orbit each other with practiced care. The word family pricked him; there was a sense, always, that he had entered a room where a conversation had begun ten years ago and he had to catch up by asking one compelling question. He took an onion bagel and made it a sandwich with tomato and salt he did not apologize for. Julian leaned in the doorway and said, \u201cThe singer posted the set list, by the way. They never do that. It made me feel falsely in the know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe song about the jars,\u201d Cornelius said. It came back to him, not the words, not the melody, but the sensation of jars breathing thinly as if they had been held under too long. \u201cDid you ever put anything in a jar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI once tried to put my bad temper in a jar,\u201d Julian said. \u201cI labeled it \u2018June\u2019 because it was worse in summer. I left it in a drawer and when I opened the drawer in February I found it had evaporated, but only from that jar. It had moved into all the other jars that were trying to be olives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it works,\u201d Elaine said. She looked between them as if she were a teacher in a class where the lesson plan was feelings but the worksheet was wedding seating arrangements. \u201cCornelius, I need you at the fitting to tell me when my face is lying. Julian, I need you later to help me convince Rick that white shirts come in whisper and not just in yell.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d Julian said, sketching a salute that made Tux look skeptical. \u201cI will arrive with a selection of whispers.\u201d\n\nThey went to the fitting and the boutique smelled like steamed fabric and an expensive complaint. While Elaine disappeared behind a curtain with a woman named Rhea who had scissors around her neck like a medical warning, Rick made little speeches to no one and everyone. Mr. Dwyer sat on a tiny couch with his legs crossed and his crossword tilt to his mouth and asked Cornelius if he thought \u201ckind\u201d could be a synonym for \u201csort,\u201d then answered himself and noted that all words were cousins if you met them at a family reunion. Cornelius nodded and let himself be proud when he found himself saying, \u201cSometimes they hate each other for how alike they are.\u201d\n\nIn the mirror opposite the little couch there was a reflection of the curtain. The curtain moved as if someone else was back there too or as if the boutique had a draft that was superior to other drafts. Every now and then he saw not the shape of the version of his mother that belonged to his ninth birthday party or his high school graduation, but a person he did not recognize who wore her bones. He decided it was the lighting. He decided it was the curtain. He decided it was the part of his brain that liked to write poems under the word \u201crisk.\u201d He kept deciding things until Elaine stepped out and the language of the room changed and there was nothing left to do but witness.\n\nShe did not look like someone else\u2019s best story. She looked like herself, which was a story. She looked like the person who had held his shirt in the dryer on the morning of picture day and told it, Be kind. She looked like the person who had once put a sprig of mint in a glass and made him feel like they were rich. He breathed out. He did not need to say anything because his face had the thing she wanted in it and she saw it. Rick said something about officiants as if the officiant were the weather. Mr. Dwyer stood up without realizing it and then sat back down as if standing had been an impulsive marriage proposal. Julian put his knuckles in his mouth for a second and then took them out and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll need stronger shoes,\u201d and Elaine said, \u201cOh, I know,\u201d and they laughed like the only two people on a bench.\n\nAfterward they went for coffee because Elaine believed in balancing luxury with ritual. The coffee place had the warmth of a place where the milk steamer once had a personality and then went to college. The woman behind the counter had a name tag that read MAE and a sweater with a hole in the shoulder that had been repaired with yarn of the wrong color. She took their order without writing anything down and said, \u201cCornelius,\u201d with the tone of someone who is reminding you of a debt and a birthday simultaneously. He did his best not to flinch, because you could not live in this town and flinch at your name; it would wear you to a nub. He was about to say something neutral and ordinary when she added, \u201cYou left your change last time,\u201d and handed him a quarter with a smear on its face that looked like the continent that would always show up first when he tried to make pancakes of states.\n\nHe turned the quarter over. He had not bought anything here the last time; he had never been here in this particular room, not since they moved it from its old location on the corner by the laundromat with the missing O in its sign. He looked up at her and she smiled. It was a good smile if you liked not being able to tell exactly what the person wanted you to do next. He put the quarter in his pocket with Mr. Dwyer\u2019s note as if the two might have things to say to each other in the dark. Julian was watching him with that patient interest he had when he wanted to be a witness but not a detective. Elaine was talking to the barista about the bouquet in a photograph behind the register and whether it had been heavy.\n\nBy the time they got home, Rick had to change and go to a meeting about a meeting. He left in the way he always left, with a promise he would be back soon and a confusion about which set of keys he needed for his car, because his keys were essentially a small orchestra and each had an ego. Mr. Dwyer stayed long enough to retrieve his casserole dish and to say that the light in the bathroom felt like it had forgiven him. He left a new note on the fridge without telling anyone, which Cornelius found later: If this house were a person, I\u2019d tell her to stop sighing when she sits down. \u2014D. He put his palm on the fridge door and felt it hum its own reasons.\n\nHe went upstairs with the book and decided to read Chapter 3 through, properly, without skipping or charming himself with single lines. The author wrote as if they had an ear pressed to a certain artery of the county and could tell you which way the blood was going and which corners had trouble and where a building\u2019s ankle would give if you pushed. Some houses wear faces they found in other neighborhoods, the first sentence said again, and this time he imagined their house with a borrowed expression the way you hold a friend\u2019s phone and it makes your hand look strange. There was a section about windows that had given up: not broken, not even cracked, but resigned. When a window goes tired, the author said, it admits a different sort of weather. He thought of the downstairs bathroom. He thought of the mirror knowing someone who needed it more. He thought of his bedroom window, the trapezoid morning, and the way he had placed the book face-down to save the room from knowing too much about itself.\n\nJulian knocked and then didn\u2019t wait because that is what you do when you decide the person is less likely to say yes if you make them pronounce it. \u201cWe should go to the hill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt smells like rain but they haven\u2019t told it it\u2019s raining yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always want to go the second before a thing starts,\u201d Cornelius said, and he said it fondly because the fondness felt like the little handle on a drawer you don\u2019t always open. He put the book down and stood and felt every place his socks held his feet. \u201cAll right.\u201d\n\nThe hill had elected to be magnanimous about the weather. It had made puddles in advance, as if this were now part of its service. The planes were out but not many; they looked preoccupied, as if they had just come from a fight two towns over and were telling themselves a story in order to land. The grass had a slick it wore like a nervous bowtie. They found their usual slice of ground and sat in the way they were learning to sit together\u2014adjacent, at an angle that allowed for an exit and pretended it didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a word for the thing when you think you see somebody you know in a crowd,\u201d Julian said. \u201cNot d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Not that. The other thing. It\u2019s about faces and how the mind cheats.\u201d\n\n\u201cApophenia,\u201d Cornelius said, and then immediately doubted himself because the word came up wearing a coat that might have belonged to something else. \u201cOr that might be patterns. It might be the wrong coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw Mr. Dwyer outside the Wawa last night,\u201d Julian said. \u201cExcept it wasn\u2019t him. I was going to go over and remind him not to hang wet towels on the rack he put in, but then the man turned into someone the age I am when he turned his head.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did that too,\u201d Cornelius said, because the trick of sharing is not to weigh it down. \u201cI saw him in a jacket,\u201d and he gestured, which was the same as saying, You\u2019re not alone in the mis-seeing. \u201cMae was at the coffee place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one with the unicycle horse guy in line sometimes,\u201d Julian said, and this was how they spoke: as if the nouns had agreed among themselves to be part of a set. He looked at the sky and it looked back like a person who thinks you are about to say something and isn\u2019t sure they want to hear it. \u201cWe could look for her.\u201d\n\nCornelius made a face and then smoothed it down. \u201cI don\u2019t know who she is, in the proper nouns way,\u201d he said. \u201cShe keeps being the corner of rooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike the cat,\u201d Julian said, and Tux would have appreciated that if she had been there to see herself analogized.\n\nThey didn\u2019t find Mae on the hill; they found a man with a broken kite and a father with a dot of ketchup on his cheek and a teenage girl sitting on the ground like she had been told, conclusively, that she was the problem and was practicing her counterargument in the grass. They watched a woman run past with such concentration that the air around her seemed to have been organized by appointment. They watched a flight of geese correct themselves the way a sentence gets corrected on a second pass. They did not talk much. The sound of a train arrived as a rumor and then became an event behind the trees. When the first drop of rain hit his wrist, Cornelius looked at it like a receipt he was not sure he needed to keep.\n\nAt home there was a new voice in the vents. He knew because it said his name the way his ninth-grade math teacher had said it when the question of whether he had the right number of parentheses had become a moral issue. He stood in the hallway and listened to the vent as if it were an uncle. He did not call for anyone because experience had taught him that inviting witnesses made the magic go home and sometimes he preferred to watch it stand unashamed in his kitchen and then leave of its own volition. The voice said, \u201cCorn,\u201d which was what his room said, and then it said, \u201cDone,\u201d very distinctly, and he had the dark, distantly funny sense of someone ticking a box.\n\nHe went upstairs and checked each window by putting his forehead briefly against the glass as if it were a person with a fever. The glass had the same temperature as his thoughts, which was no help. In his nightstand there was a scrap of paper he did not remember putting there. It had the neat version of his handwriting on it and read: Tuesday groceries: screws (brass), green beans, bread, forgetfulness. Eat apple. \u2014M. He sat on his bed with the scrap and let it sit in his lap like a small polite animal. He thought of the apple core on the napkin, the mercy he had shown a piece of trash, and felt something complicated move under his sternum like a suitcase going down a flight of stairs very quietly.\n\nWhen he showed the note to Dr. Vale the next day, they held it with two fingers as if it were evidence and a tissue. \u201cYou wrote this,\u201d they said, not as a question but as an observation left on his coffee table for later. \u201cBut you also found it. How does that feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike there are two of me,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of them is late. One leaves me fruit.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like the one who leaves fruit,\u201d they said, and it was as soothing as being told you liked something you already knew you liked. \u201cM.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who that is when it isn\u2019t me,\u201d he said. \u201cMae is real. She has a sweater with a hole. She knows my name. But then the notes. And then Mr. Dwyer\u2019s note about the head that isn\u2019t his head. And the bathroom light being a person who uses the wrong pronouns for us on purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d they said. They had their leg thrown over their knee and their sock was a color that made him think of pediatric waiting rooms. \u201cWhat happens if M is just a part of you that had to sign himself because you needed the signature.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be relieving,\u201d he said. He pressed his thumb into the chair notch that belonged to him. \u201cIt would be relieving to be an ordinary split.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if M isn\u2019t,\u201d they said, not invested in the answer and entirely invested in watching him find it.\n\n\u201cThen I don\u2019t want to know yet,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the knowing gets there before the wanting is ready to be a place.\u201d\n\n\u201cPractice that sentence,\u201d they murmured, simply pleased by it. \u201cKeep your windows halfway. You can let the weather in without being responsible for the thunder.\u201d\n\nWhen he left their office the plant in the waiting room had been replaced with not a plant but a photograph of a plant. It sat in the same pot, printed in glossy, as if someone had told it to hold its pose for longer than plants are built to pose. A new sticky note on the frame said: Succulent in memoriam. Please refrain from watering. \u2014D.V. He smiled and then stopped smiling and put his fingers behind his back as if water might leap from them without his consent.\n\nHe drove to work and the store hummed and the bolts weighed wrong and he took pleasure in being able to tell. He rearranged a display of hammers so their heads looked a little less like threats. He made a small ceremony of shaking the rug in the entry, because the rug had a habit of trapping gravel that made all the carts complain. At lunch there was another note in his bag in the neat handwriting. The bag had a sandwich he did not remember making and a cookie he would have chosen if he had been the person who had made it. Good. Practice letting someone like you. \u2014M. He folded the note and put it with the others and then took it out again and read it once more as if it were going to change while he watched. He thought about showing it to Julian and then did not because he did not know how to explain the generosity without also explaining the fear that came with it, and fear makes everything tacky if you\u2019re not careful.\n\nAt night he and Julian lay on the living room floor with Tux between them like a referee who believed in none of them. They were not touching but they were in the same dimension. The television was on but muted; a man in a suit said important things with his eyebrows and no one felt threatened. The window in the living room had one blind slat that had started to warp; it made the light from the street into a little wave across the ceiling. \u201cI keep thinking about the song with the floor that sloped,\u201d Julian said. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst kind of slow catastrophe, where you want to believe the whole time that you are deciding to lie down.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe house we rented when I was seven had a floor like that,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cIf you put your pencil down on the desk it would roll and you could learn what you had done wrong by whether the pencil came back. I had a teacher who put tape under one leg of each chair to make things pretend to be right. It worked like makeup. It didn\u2019t work like gospel.\u201d\n\nJulian turned his head and looked at him the way you look at an animal in your yard you want to invite in but you\u2019ve watched enough nature shows to know about wildness. \u201cWe can get the floor in this room leveled,\u201d he said. \u201cRick would approve of a project he can talk about at parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cI think I like the slant. It makes you very aware of what you want. You have to decide to sit.\u201d\n\n\u201cPractice deciding,\u201d Julian said. \u201cPractice liking the wrong hill.\u201d He reached out and let his fingers touch the carpet an inch from Cornelius\u2019s hand as if demonstrating a concept. \u201cPractice letting someone like you,\u201d he added, and then looked at the ceiling too quickly, as if the confession had been a moth.\n\nCornelius breathed. He could feel the seam in the carpet with the tip of his finger. It was like the line between two days, and how you do not know when one becomes the other until you go to wash your face and realize the mirror is tired of showing you the old one. The house made a sound in its bones like a yes. From the kitchen came the sister sound of plates settling. From somewhere under the floor, or over it, or in the vent that ran past the hall where the half-room said his name, he heard the small, unimportant sound of someone putting a glass down carefully so it would not startle anyone, and then he heard nothing, which lately was his favorite sound in the world.\n\nHe woke in the middle of the next night to a smell of citrus. It was not the lemon cleaner; it was an orange that had been cut open in another room. He went downstairs and found half an orange on the counter with its own absence of bite marks, the way a fruit looks when it has been performed at rather than eaten. There was a napkin tucked under it with a single word written in the neat hand: Later. He stood with his hand on the counter and the counter\u2019s cool pushing against the meat of his palm and thought about what it means to be told to wait by a thing you want. The refrigerator hummed as if in sympathy. The clock on the stove said a nonsense time and then corrected itself, and then said the nonsense time again, as if it were practicing its panic.\n\nThe next day at work he caught sight of a woman in the aisle with the flashlights whose hair was the color of tea you make for someone you love and then forget to bring them. He had the certain uncertain sense of having known that hair before. She turned and her face arranged itself into someone who had stood behind him once in a line that moved like a train in fog. She looked at him with real curiosity and then at the flashlights as if they could help, and he did what he could: he found the batteries that would last longer than anyone promised and showed her how to open the little plastic hinge without swearing. When she left she said, \u201cThank you, Cornelius,\u201d and he wanted to ask for her name so that he could put it somewhere and see if it left a note for him later, but he let the moment leave with a proper posture.\n\nThere were two new sticky notes on his pillow when he got home. One was from Julian, unsigned except for the way the J tailed off twice and then the tail decided to be its own letter in a separate alphabet: The window on the stairs looks like it wants to say something. If you catch it, tell it I\u2019m listening. The other was from M, or from himself pretending to be M, or from the part of him that had decided that giving himself permission required paperwork: You don\u2019t have to hold the hot thing long enough to prove you can. Just touch and tell. \u2014M. He lay on his bed and held both notes and had the disconcerting feeling that he had missed the point once by holding a thing too long. He put the notes under the book because the book liked to keep company.\n\nThe show in Haddonfield had loosened a small knot in him he had tied himself when he was twenty and believed if he did not tighten it, the world would accelerate without warning and fling him. He went with Julian to the grocery store and did not leave when the fluorescent light decided to be a personality, because Julian was there and because he had the note in his pocket that said Later and it had to choose a later and this was one. He picked a bag of green beans for no reason and then put it back because the green beans had been picked out of the bag by other hands and he didn\u2019t like the public intimacy of that. He bought milk and bread and a lemon. He bought a pack of screws because he couldn\u2019t not when he saw them poorly placed. He carried the bag to the car and felt like he had balanced something he could not name.\n\nAt the house, the stairs window had condensed on the interior, little half-circles of moisture like sentences in a language he had not agreed to learn. He touched the glass with the back of his hand, just a grazing, and it pulsed under his skin the way music does when you stand too close to a subwoofer at a party you did not want to attend. He did not know what it wanted to say. He did know that the house had a way of telling him things once and then leaving it to him to remember, and lately remembering felt like trying to catch a moth without hurting it. He went downstairs and found Julian on the couch with Tux draped over his lap like a garment. \u201cIt\u2019s saying you should clean it,\u201d Julian said, without looking up. \u201cIt\u2019s a practical poet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the vinegar,\u201d Cornelius said. He said it in a voice that made the glass and the cat and the man on the couch into something you could call joyful without feeling like you had lied.\n\nHe cleaned the window and the vinegar smell made him think of nights his mother had spent in kitchens that weren\u2019t theirs, making them smell like home by force. He watched the way the cloth moved across the glass, the way the streaks agreed to organize themselves under the pressure of a hand. He talked to the window, quietly, the way you talk to a thing you want to reassure. He told it that they were making decisions, that they were not always good at it and sometimes they counted planes instead of houses, but they would get there, or here, wherever here was. He waited for the word that would come through from the other side, the way voices sometimes came through, and when none did he accepted the quiet as the answer. He could do that. He could learn to accept quiet and call it a sentence.\n\nLater, in the kitchen with a towel over his shoulder like an apology, he cut the orange in halves again and put the quarters on a plate. He wrote M on a napkin and put the napkin under the plate and felt a ridiculous sense of theater that did not embarrass him, which was growth. He left the plate on the table and went to bed and woke in the night to the sound of someone finding the plate in the dark without knocking anything else over, and the next morning the napkin was gone. He waited for fear. It didn\u2019t come. He found, instead, a note on the back of a receipt for onions that did not match anything they had bought. The note said: Good. Braver than yesterday. Let that count. \u2014M. He put the receipt with its onion price in his wallet behind the photograph of the hill and felt himself add the number for bravery to some ledger he hadn\u2019t realized he had been keeping since he was the age when you first understand that wishing doesn\u2019t make your parents love each other more but you keep doing it because you\u2019re superstitious about despair.\n\nThey went to the hill again, because that was what they did now when the day felt like a room with too many people in it. The planes obliged them with their obedience. The geese pretended to be governors. The grass pretended to be something it wasn\u2019t and did a convincing job. They sat and counted, because counting is a kind of spell. Julian talked about a job interview he had postponed, about the way he was practicing answers in the mirror without wanting to stare into anyone\u2019s head that wasn\u2019t his. Cornelius talked about bolts and the way the weight had shifted since the new supplier, about the possibility of telling his manager in a way that didn\u2019t sound like an accusation. He could feel the box in his head he had labeled DO NOT OPEN ALONE; he could feel that something in it had changed shape, and he understood suddenly that what you put into a box doesn\u2019t stop moving just because you shut the lid. He leaned back on his elbows and let the unimportant pain in his wrists tell him he was alive.\n\n\u201cTell me the truth,\u201d Julian said, his voice the kind you use when you want to invite a person to step onto a piece of ice with you. \u201cDid the hill tell you anything today.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt told me not to collect people the way I collect screws,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cIt told me to keep only what fits in my pocket and doesn\u2019t cut the lining. It told me to learn the difference between heavy and good.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mae,\u201d Julian said, not because he wanted to know but because the pattern demanded the name.\n\n\u201cShe was at the coffee place,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cShe gave me a quarter I didn\u2019t deserve.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople do that,\u201d Julian said. \u201cThey give you change for a bill you haven\u2019t handed them yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you ever think we\u2019re all versions of the same person in different lights,\u201d Cornelius asked, and the question left his mouth before he could give it a belt and shoes and a haircut. \u201cLike the way a house wears faces from other neighborhoods. Maybe we\u2019re just neighborhoods wearing each other\u2019s faces until we forget to give them back.\u201d\n\nJulian looked at him like a joke that had landed and then found it was a bird. \u201cIf that\u2019s true,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I hope I get your eyebrows. They\u2019re decisive. They know what they want without being cruel about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can borrow,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cBut I want them back by Thursday.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Julian said, and he held out his hand in a theater of handshakes that neither of them went to because sometimes the metaphor was enough, and sometimes touching was a thing you saved like a small currency.\n\nThat night the house breathed differently. Rick came home with a speech and no audience and gave it anyway to the cat, who looked unimpressed and warmed. Elaine put the magazines away as if performing a ritual for a god of paper and then sat at the table and hummed without memory of ever humming. Mr. Dwyer called to ask if the light was behaving and left a message in which he apologized to no one for doubting his own eyes. The downstairs bathroom light held. The mirror did its job and only its job. The note on the fridge that said If this house were a person had acquired a line under it, underlined by no one like an agreement. Cornelius stood at the bottom of the stairs with his hand on the banister which had been worn by three other families and knew the exact weight of their rings, and he let the house have its say, and he had his, which was to go to bed with the book open to the rusted paperclip mark and to dream of a window that opened not onto the yard but onto a room where someone who signed his name with a neat hand was sitting with a cup of tea and a pencil and a willingness to wait.Chapter 5\n\nThe first thing he did when he woke from the window dream was put the book on the floor, because it had been too close to his head and he could feel his thoughts smudged where it had rested. The second thing he did was reach for a pen he kept in the drawer with socks that had given up on being pairs. He sat cross-legged on the bed with his hair doing the thing that made him look like he had been listening to static too closely, and he wrote on the back of a grocery list for a week that was not this one. He wrote, Hello, which felt formal and unnecessary, and then he wrote, If you are me, thank you for the apple and the nerve. If you are not me, please leave the sink alone when I am sleeping. Underneath that, he added, What do you want. He folded the paper into a small, square politeness and slid it under his pillow the way people in stories hide teeth for fairies. He did not expect anything; it is easiest to wait when you have removed expectation from the room like a bucket you keep tripping over.\n\nDownstairs the day had put on a dry shirt and decided to be responsible. Julian sat at the table with a bowl of cereal that had given up being crisp, reading a job listing on his phone and making a face like the job had told a joke he was not in on. Elaine slid toast into the toaster with more ceremony than the action required and was telling the butter, out loud, to remember it was butter and not a soap. Tux had her paws on the chair rung, the picture of practice. \u201cThere\u2019s a flea market on Saturday,\u201d Julian said without looking up. \u201cColumbus. They have a guy who sells old doorknobs like they\u2019re records. I thought you might want to\u2026you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always want a thing that used to be a thing,\u201d Cornelius said, and he said it in a voice that told Julian he\u2019d already said yes. He poured tea and put sugar in it in the increments that made doctors sigh and wait for a better moment to bring it up. The idea of the flea market arrived in his head with the smell of soft pretzels and wet cardboard and the particular sadness of a bin of remotes whose televisions had gone on without them. He saw, in advance, a table with little drawers, one missing a pull, and the careful handwriting of a person who had labeled each drawer \u201cAssorted.\u201d\n\nElaine said she\u2019d make coffee for them to take and then forgot she had promised and then remembered at the exact moment she opened the fridge for something else, and she laughed at herself and made the coffee with great seriousness. \u201cYou boys need hats,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when it is pretending not to be summer, the parking lot is a pan.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad says hats ruin a man\u2019s hairline,\u201d Julian said, deadpan, and Elaine rolled her eyes to a place where her mother would have been waiting with a spoon to say that hairline ruin started in the womb with unpreparedness. It was a house built of small lines like that, and if you kept them in your pockets you always had something to give back to a person who expected nothing and was delighted by the thought of change.\n\nThey left on Saturday before the town had fully decided which errands it would commit to. The Wawa lot was a composition in gray, and then there was Julian\u2019s hoodie like a declaration, and then there was the coffee and the way Cornelius liked to hold heat briefly and then let it go to prove nothing to anyone. The highway gathered them up and put them down in a field arranged into lanes by vendors who believed in their own ability to create order out of old toys and kitchen implements. The sky had a flatness to it that suited rummaging. The men who shouted at you to come see a miracle were selling knives or tape or the idea that if a thing cuts through a shoe, it must therefore be good.\n\nWhat he liked best about the market was the ache of specificity. You could turn your head and find a collection of snow globes that had come from one woman\u2019s life and each had been shaken when a certain song came on in a certain December. You could find a crate of old house numbers, each one a way of saying Here we are to a stranger who had meant to go next door. He walked past a table with a tangle of chargers and watched a man in a neon cap pick one up as if it might forgive him his sins. He watched a child pick up a cracked crystal doorknob and declare it a gemstone and then be corrected by a parent who liked truth like a hobby. He stopped at a spread of brass hinges and felt the heft of them in his palm the way you hold a history and see if it intends to keep talking.\n\nThe woman behind the table with the doorknobs and sash weights had hair the color of tea you forget and then sip anyway. Her sweater had a hole mended with a darker yarn that made the hole honest instead of repaired. When she looked up at him, she made a small sound of recognition that was softer than a \u201cHi\u201d and more specific. Her name tag read MAE in the tidy capitals of someone who had considered lowercase and declined. She lifted a sash weight as if she were showing him the heart of someone who had been a good house.\n\n\u201cThese were made when gravity had a code of ethics,\u201d she said. \u201cFeel that.\u201d\n\nHe did, and it was the kind of heavy that tells you it intends to be loyal. The weight sat in his hand like a long single thought. \u201cThey put velvet in shoes now to make them feel like this,\u201d he said, and Mae smiled as if the sentence reminded her of someone she had been fond of in a life with more socks in it.\n\n\u201cYou carry yourself like someone who has learned to tell the difference,\u201d she said. \u201cBetween heavy and bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am practicing,\u201d he said, and the table made the polite sound of a surface that would prefer you not put your coffee down on it. Julian circled and found a metal tin with a picture of a ship on it and said, \u201cThis would make a good place for secrets,\u201d and then realized he had said it out loud and colored as if he had shared a baby photo.\n\n\u201cI keep quarters from nowhere,\u201d Mae said. \u201cI put them in a medicine bottle and pretend I\u2019ve cured something. Some days I spend them and it\u2019s like telling a joke to a cashier and you both know it\u2019s not very good but you are saving the day anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Cornelius,\u201d he said, because the rhythm demanded the equation of strangers, and her eyebrows did a small, delighted lift at being given the name she already had known. \u201cYou gave me a quarter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI returned it,\u201d she said, and her tone held that fine edge between tease and insistence. \u201cDebt is a door, not a weight. Don\u2019t carry it, use it.\u201d\n\nHe bought a sash weight not because he knew what he would do with it but because it made the heaviest sense. He bought a handful of glass knobs, none of them matched, to make a future drawer happier. Mae wrapped them in the brown paper you can only find at markets like this, paper that used to be part of a person\u2019s map. She handed him the bag and then, like a friend passing a note under a desk, tucked a small folded thing into his palm. He did not look because he understood the religion of delayed revelation. He thanked her. He did not tell her that sometimes his apartment keys made a noise at the same time as voices in vents. She probably already knew in the way people like Mae know what kind of light has a grudge.\n\nThey walked. Julian carried the tin and the weight as if he were demonstrating a metaphor to a class that might not deserve it. He talked about the job again, and this time there were specifics; there would be a man named Reggie who had worked there forever and liked to pronounce acronyms as if they were his grandchildren, and a woman named Shaila who had once trained to be a florist and now maintained the database like a bouquet she was determined would not wilt. Cornelius listened and said the right encouraging things without making them into a spell. He bought a bag of kettle corn that turned his fingers into a small grease festival. He considered a set of chisels because they were honest and sharp and then left them because the day was already holding many corners.\n\nBack at the car he opened the note from Mae. It was not his handwriting, but it had a family resemblance, the way cousins stand in the same way when they\u2019re thinking. The paper had been torn from a book of receipts; the back had onions listed at a price that felt aspirational. The note read, Do not be so good at leaving yourself breadcrumbs that you forget you can stay in the wood. \u2014M. He put it in his wallet with the others and felt, as always, the small compression of fear followed immediately by the relief of having something to hold that wasn\u2019t a worry. He did not show Julian. He wanted to, but the note had hands of its own and wanted to be held by one person at a time.\n\nWhen they got home, Rick was rearranging the hall closet like a man practicing for a TED Talk about the misuse of space. He had a shoebox full of batteries he\u2019d bought in bulk because he liked any word that promised abundance. He said, \u201cLook at this, can you believe how they wasted the top shelf,\u201d and Elaine said, without looking up from a list of song choices the DJ had sent, \u201cIt\u2019s where I keep the winter.\u201d Mr. Dwyer arrived with a bag of oranges like a punchline and said a thing about scurvy that made Tux leave the room out of principle. The ordinary accumulation of a day took courage to stand inside of, and Cornelius felt heroic just moving his shoes out of the doorway and not hitting anyone with the sash weight when it knocked his shin through no fault of its own.\n\nHe carried the weight upstairs and put it in the corner of his room as if that corner had been cheating on gravity and needed to be reminded of its responsibilities. The book on the floor looked up at him without apology. He touched the pillow and felt the note beneath it like a thought. He left it. The experiment was to wait. He could do that. He could practice not jostling the universe and calling it patience.\n\nAt dinner, Elaine asked if anyone had strong feelings about aisle runners. Rick advocated for something that looked like the jersey of a team he had invented and loved. Mr. Dwyer advocated for clean shoes. Julian advocated for walking like you meant it, which made Elaine kiss him on the head in the manner of a person appreciating a sentence and its speaker equally. Cornelius advocated for the absence of petals, because petals on floors look like regret if the lighting is wrong. They ate salad that had fallen into its bowl very willingly and a dish with chickpeas that had changed their name at least three times on their way to being served. The candles were lit because it was a day. The house gathered itself into the cool of evening and did its little shiftings and small operas. The downstairs bathroom light held without blinking and someone said aloud the sort of \u201cthank you\u201d you send into the part of the world that doesn\u2019t require thank-yous to continue.\n\nHe slept the thinly satisfied sleep of a person who has not cried but has thought about it and considers that a kind of participation. He woke at three the way he does. The pillow had a new weight. He turned on his side and retrieved the note underneath like a magician pulling a ribbon out of his own mouth. The same neat hand had written, I want to be allowed to want without being the only one who wants. Leave the door on the chain sometimes. I can reach through. \u2014M. He read it twice and then once more to make sure the letters weren\u2019t moving when he looked away. He put the note with the others, then did a thing he had not thought he would do: he wrote back on the back of a dry cleaning receipt from a suit he had worn once to a graduation that had not entirely belonged to him. He wrote, The chain is on. Try me. He slid it into the gap between the door and its frame where the chain lives, and he went back to bed. He did not sleep. He lay and felt his heart perform planning meetings.\n\nIn the morning, the receipt was gone. In its place was nothing at all, which was either rude or the point. The chain sat with its own pride. He made tea and did not tell the tea what it needed to be this time. He told Julian instead that he had found a thing for their future drawer, and he told Elaine that the sash weight would make a good argument against certain drafts, and he told Rick that the batteries had best not be near the stove because the house did not like combative objects huddling. He told no one about the note and its disappearance and the way his name had started to sound in his head like the last light of evening on the kitchen table when everyone gets up but the table remains, gathering the day as if it had been invited.\n\nHe kept his appointment with Dr. Vale because those were the kinds of appointments you keep if you want to build anything that doesn\u2019t fall over when the washing machine thinks too hard about suds. The waiting room had the photograph of a plant in the old plant\u2019s pot, and a new photograph of a plant that had presumably died elsewhere, as if to keep the first one company, as if the room were a small gallery of failures that had decided to be art. He touched neither frame out of respect for what you are not meant to correct. Dr. Vale wore a sweater that made him think of schools and halls with waxed floors. Their hair did what hair does when its owner has stopped trying to influence it and has moved on to other ambitions.\n\nHe told them about the market and the weight and Mae\u2019s note about woods and crumbs. He told them about the chain. He did not tell them about the half-grief that followed the word \u201cTry me\u201d being taken seriously by a person who might be him and might not. Dr. Vale listened the way good translators listen when the speaker believes they are speaking the only true language. \u201cBoundaries,\u201d they said, not as an order but as a diagnosis for something that had survived. \u201cYou did that without writing \u2018No trespass\u2019 on your forehead. How does it feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like I put a sign on a window and the window didn\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI expected to be punished for deciding anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the notes,\u201d they said. \u201cDo you want less of them.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the fake plant pretending to do its job without chlorophyll. He looked at the actual M note folded perfectly in his pocket, making its little right angles of insistence. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI want permission to want them without labeling it a symptom.\u201d\n\nDr. Vale did the smile they do when they have recognized a good use of their own vocabulary in the wild. \u201cYou can ask for that. Start with yourself. Then try your kitchen. It\u2019s often more forgiving than your head.\u201d\n\nThey talked about Julian then, and how it was easier to be kind in a moving car. They talked about the wedding and how a public ritual can make private quiet easier to place in the house without apologizing to the furniture. They did not talk about fear like a monster under the bed; they talked about fear like a small dog that barks because the world makes doors slam. When he left, the photograph of the plant looked relieved that he had not tried to water it with his worry.\n\nOn the day of Julian\u2019s interview, the house put its hand on the small of his back in the gentle pressure of everything going well if you pretend the going is optional. Julian wore a shirt that had decided to be brave and a jacket that thought it could make him look like he could afford to hear no and keep breathing easily. He stood in the doorway and made the motion of leaving three times, then stopped and looked at Cornelius and said, \u201cTell me a thing I can put in my pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour hands smell like oranges,\u201d Cornelius said, and then quickly added, \u201cIn that good way when you open a peel and it makes the room remember that winter ends. You can take that. It\u2019s a fact. It is not dependent on their mood.\u201d\n\nJulian nodded the way you nod to a doctor who is recommending a treatment that has fewer side effects than panic. He took a breath that made his ribs remember they had been made for something besides protecting frightened things. Cornelius reached for a scrap of paper and wrote, quietly self-mocking, QC-MAN APPROVES, then drew a little tape measure with a cape. He folded it and handed it over. Julian tucked it into his wallet as if it were a photograph of childhood that needed a new home.\n\nThe hour after Julian left was an hour made of slow objects. The clock on the stove huffed. Tux stared at a spot on the wall until the wall apologized and offered to be more interesting next time. Elaine went to look at flowers alone because sometimes she needed to practice making decisions that no one protested, and also because she liked the smell of green in the cold compartments where flowers wait. Rick called twice, once to ask if the red tie made him look like a judge of something and once to ask where he had put his lucky pen that was just a pen that had once signed a thing that had not later been regretted. Mr. Dwyer knocked and then remembered he had a key and then knocked again and got his own timing wrong. He walked in and stood in the kitchen and said, \u201cWhat is the word for when the house is saying something only you can hear and you will seem unwell if you ask someone else if they hear it too.\u201d\n\n\u201cTuesday,\u201d Cornelius said, and Mr. Dwyer made the face of a person who had been offered a cookie you weren\u2019t sure you had earned.\n\nThey drank tea and Mr. Dwyer told a story about a co-worker who had taken up beekeeping and now had opinions about the quiet of rooms he used not to care about. The notes on the fridge had tried to be helpful and had ended up sounding like the menu of a very specific restaurant. There was one from Elaine: Bring pins. There was one in Julian\u2019s hand, quick and leaning: If I die in a lobby, tell them I loved the fish. There was one from M, because of course there was; Cornelius found it tucked behind a magnet shaped like a corn cob that someone\u2019s aunt had considered whimsical. It said, You asked. I want to stand in the room with you when you decide and not press my thumb on the scale. \u2014M.\n\nHe took the note upstairs and sat on his bed and folded and unfolded it until it resembled an idea that had been lived in. He put it under the book\u2019s cover, between Chapter 3 and the chapter about stairs that forget which step is the last and love to trick you. He touched the chain on the door without looking at it and was surprised to find it warm. He realized he had fallen in love with how he began trusting things and was not yet ready to tell the things about it.\n\nJulian came home with the air of someone who had been asked to judge a parade of hats and told he wore his own head well. He stood in the doorway and did a small dance that was entirely in the elbows and said, \u201cI was not terrible,\u201d and then let himself lean against the wall in exactly the way he did when his body did not know yet where to put a relief. He took his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to the little cape and said, \u201cHe was there,\u201d and Cornelius said, \u201cHe has very strong opinions about adhesive labels,\u201d and then they stood in the kitchen and allowed themselves to be pleased without saying a single sentence about deserving it.\n\nThe wedding date scooted closer in the friendly, aggressive way dates have in the middle of the calendar. Elaine tried on shoes that cost like a choice and walked in them in the hall with the determination of a woman being honest about pain. Rick practiced a speech in the mirror that began with a joke about how he had once thought marriage was like joining a bowling league and then realized he had to learn his partner\u2019s release and footwork and temperament and have a good cry in the parking lot when the pins knocked themselves down in his heart. Mr. Dwyer made a list of people to sit near people who would make them less awful. Cornelius took his sash weight downstairs and hung it temporarily in the hall to explain to Rick the concept; Rick pretended to understand and then later said to Julian, \u201cWhat is it,\u201d and Julian said, \u201cA very nice rock,\u201d and Rick felt satisfied.\n\nThe house began to make a new sound at night, not a yes and not a no, a longer word he could not hear all of. It began, the sound, near the vent, and moved along the seams of walls as if looking for the right place to end its sentence. He woke at two and lay with his palms flat against the sheets to see if the quiet was in his hands or the room. He heard the half-room say his name in its slow syllable and then, much later, he heard it say, Wait, as if you were saying it to a dog you intended to treat. He said, \u201cAll right,\u201d out loud, so the house would not feel it had to be theatrical to get his attention.\n\nHe saw Mae twice more before he decided that choosing not to ask a person if they know you is a kind of ethics and maybe also a kind of fear. Once she was in the store for batteries and once she was standing at the end of the aisle that held gutter hooks for lights, considering the physics of cheer. Both times she greeted him with his name as if he had volunteered it, and both times she left without buying the thing that had called her into the place; some people step into rooms to make sure they still exist, and then they go. The second time, as she turned, he caught sight of a scar on her wrist in the exact place where his watch had once raised a rash, and he had the thought that human bodies conspire across distances to make the same mistakes for the same reasons and then meet in aisles to prove it. He put his hand to the screws because that was his scripture.\n\nOne afternoon, Rick came home with a carton of eggs that turned out all to be brown, which Elaine preferred because the brown ones looked more like eggs had looked in her childhood when chickens had been closer to them; he made a triumphal noise as if he had returned with treasure from the city. He put the carton in the fridge and something in the way he closed the door reminded the fridge of a story, because later when Cornelius went to get a lemon, he found a sticky note on the inside of the door that read, You do not need permission to be here. This is not a store. \u2014M. The note had been stuck behind the butter. It had gotten cold on its way to him. He warmed it in his hands and thought for an unworthy second about turning the note into a refrigerator magnet, and then he told himself you didn\u2019t turn permission into a product.\n\nThat night, Julian and Cornelius lay on the living room floor again because the carpet had ideas about therapy and the ceiling had accepted its role as confessional. Tux took up residence on the couch back in the way of cats who want to watch without committing to any one person\u2019s gravity. They watched a movie without the sound and improved it with their own voices, and at some point, because sometimes you do touch a person in your life even if you have sworn not to for a month to see who you are without that, Julian\u2019s hand drifted and landed on the back of Cornelius\u2019s wrist. It was a touch like specification. It was not long. It was not romantic in the way songs make paints peel. It was exactly enough to make the nervous system say, I see. He did not jerk away or laugh. He did not narrate it. He did not later mention it when he wrote a note to himself in his head about how he wanted to go very slowly because he did not trust the part of him that liked to sprint toward people and throw his wallet and his personality at their lawn.\n\nOn a wet morning when the planes had decided to take the long, careful route, he met Dr. Vale at a diner that had survived three separate renovations and had the kind of walls you could forgive for their complaints. They had not planned to meet; he had texted and they had said, \u201cI am near eggs,\u201d and he had said, \u201cI approve,\u201d and then he had gone. They sat in a booth with a rip that had been mended with tape in the same way some people apologize too loudly and you are embarrassed on the behalf of your own discomfort. He told them about the chain and the kitchen and the note on the butter, and they told him about a dream they had had about finishing shoes in which everyone wore their plan on their feet and the hard part was agreeing to go the same amount of distance as the person you loved.\n\n\u201cCollecting,\u201d they said, stirring coffee with the concentration of someone trying to make a point perform. \u201cYou collect screws because they are useful, and because they are alike enough to comfort you and different enough to keep you from feeling stuck in Mormon wallpaper. You collect notes because you are teaching yourself a way to be told. Let yourself have. Then ask yourself which things have souls that want to be held and which things want a drawer and a label and to be ignored until they are needed. There is no moral superiority in being needed.\u201d\n\nHe played with the sugar packet and did not rip it, because ripping is a choice some mornings and not a release. He thought about a box he had in his head and about the label on it he had written in his careful, school handwriting when he was so young he could still smell paste as a fact. He considered the idea that boxes could have windows and chains and you could be the guard and the guest. He did not say any of this; he told them instead that he had bought a sash weight because gravity needed reminding, and they nodded as if he had brought them flowers.\n\nThe day of the final fitting arrived like a guest who you feared would be early and was instead exactly on time. Elaine\u2019s dress hung on the door and made the light in the room do what light does when fabric invites it to behave. The boutique had unlocked a patience for them that had been hidden behind plastic garment bags. Rhea the seamstress had her small sticks of chalk lined up like a family. \u201cShoes,\u201d Rhea said, and Elaine produced them with the glee of a person committing to a conspiracy their feet might regret. There was a small, predictable chaos. There were people in small chairs pretending they were not crying at a person standing in front of a mirror trying to balance the story of herself with the cost of hemline. There was a bouquet being gently scolded by a friend for its lack of structural integrity. Rick did his best to be both there and not there, which is a man\u2019s greatest test in rooms where lace is deciding everyone\u2019s posture. Julian was good at handing the right pins and not stepping on the train and finding the humor that did not soil the moment. Cornelius stood and watched the way the mirror arranged the room and the way the room let the mirror lie a little for their benefit, and he felt nothing dramatic; he felt a plain true thing in his chest like he had put down a heavy bag finally and remembered he had hands.\n\nHe went outside for air and found Mae on the bench by the tree that had selected itself in Julian\u2019s taxonomy as a good tree. She had a paper bag of pretzels and offered him one exactly the way a friend would in a lunchroom you had accidentally walked into twice. He took it and did not make a thing of the salt stuck to his lip. She said, \u201cI like the window in there. It tells the truth about what light does to a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good window,\u201d he said. He thought about asking her if she had left the note on the butter, and then thought about the violence of trying to force a person to match a ghost with your own handwriting. He let the thought wave and go. \u201cYou come to weddings,\u201d he said, a sentence that was not an accusation and sounded like one to ears trained to hear the world as trouble. \u201cI mean, to places where people pick what to wear in case it rains and doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like fabric stores,\u201d she said. \u201cI like rooms where people collaborate on a future and say \u2018Let me think,\u2019 and you can watch them do it. I like alterations. I like the noise of pins in a dish. And I went to buy thread,\u201d she added, producing two spools the exact color of sky an hour after the day ends from a pocket in her sweater that had been mended and remended until it had the texture of a decision you had to make ten times before it stuck. \u201cYou looked like a person who would need someone to hand them something if they put their hands in their pockets too long.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, because that was the word you say when a person has bought thread and memory without reminding you of the price. \u201cDo you know that the plants at my doctor\u2019s office have become photographs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew they would,\u201d she said, with the confidence of someone who has seen many things decide to be images. \u201cIt is a mercy for both parties. The plant was not fit for the daily rain of certain kinds of sentences. The photograph can take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you leave notes on people\u2019s butter,\u201d he asked, finally, and she laughed, a sound like a lens cap popping.\n\n\u201cI am not your mother,\u201d she said, not unkindly. \u201cI am not your angel. I am not your memory with neat borders. I am a person with a sweater that does not give up. I am a person who knows you know how to fix a light without bullying it, and I like that. That is all.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. He could feel the place in his chest where disappointment had tried to prepare a bed. He did not lie down in it. He went back inside and became, again, a person inside a particular day, and that is a job that deserves to be listed when people ask, What do you do.\n\nThe night before the wedding there was chicken that had been roasted in a pan older than any of them. There was a salad in a bowl the color of a friendly argument. There were napkins folded with the kind of care that becomes a joke later and then an heirloom. There was a silence after they ate that was not uncomfortable. Rick put his hands on the table and felt the way a different life would have made him a person who drummed on surfaces when he needed attention, and he declined that life in favor of this one, where he could say, \u201cLet me tell you about a day I didn\u2019t know anything and it was fine,\u201d and be believed. Elaine sat in her chair and looked at the men she would call her men and thought about shoes and sorrow and how you arrange them so both behave. Mr. Dwyer washed the chicken pan with tenderness and a minimum of self-congratulation. The light in the downstairs bathroom held. The vent said nothing or said everything and he had stopped needing to decide which it was.\n\nHe went to bed and put his hand on the book and thought about the chain and the door and how there is a sweetness in being able to hear a person\u2019s hand on the other side, not knocking, just being. He woke in the night to no smell at all, which was unusual and a gift. He lay and listened to the house do its breathing, the same as his mother had done in the room down the hall, the same as he had done as a child when he swore he could hear his own blood move and had named it a train to make it less lonely. In the morning, there was a single note in the kitchen stuck to the salt cellar with a magnet shaped like the state of Delaware. It read, Keep your windows at half-mast today. There will be weather. I trust you. \u2014M. He laughed a little in his throat because he had expected a list; the note had offered him a sentence and a vote.\n\nThe wedding day was a series of small competitions. The weather tried to be both and instead landed on gentleness with a show-off cloud. The vows tried to be original in a town where people had been promising and failing and promising again since sidewalks were chalk. Elaine tried not to cry and then cried anyway and forgave herself with the efficiency of a woman who does not have time to be embarrassed. Rick tried to keep the speech under seven minutes and went to nine, but only one person looked at a watch and that person was Mr. Dwyer because he was timing the moment to tell a story that needed a precise entry point. The photograph that would end up on a mantle had three versions: the one where Cornelius looked like he had accepted something, the one where Julian looked like he had been told a good joke and had tucked it under his tongue to keep, and the one where Tux, who had been smuggled into one group shot as a dare, looked like she owned the house and its social calendar.\n\nThere was dancing. Cornelius did his small version of dancing, which is to say he let the music move the area from his elbows to his shoulders and did not attempt anything below the knee that might have suggested he had ideas. Julian did the kind of dancing you do when you have spent enough time in rooms where people forget they have bodies and then remember with relief. He came back to the table flushed and urgent, put a bottle of water down that had been opened by three different cousins in their zeal to help, and said, \u201cI think I got the job,\u201d and Cornelius said, \u201cWater first,\u201d which is how he knew he had started to practice loving a person without making them a project.\n\nThe woman who had given them coffee in H-town and said his name had a line at the bar and did not look their way; if he had waved she would have seen him, but the evening had its own logic. Mae stood by the door once, watching, and then left like someone who had a train to catch, whether there was a train or not. Dr. Vale sent a text that read, Do not talk to anyone doing a bit at a reception, which made him laugh and then put his phone away because the phone had no business being at a wedding except to turn into a camera with no future for a second and then leave them alone.\n\nWhen it was over, when the rice had been replaced by bubbles because someone had read an article, when the candles had been blown with a sigh by a cousin who had questions about fate, when the cake had been less delicious than everyone hoped and better than most cakes, when the shoes had done their work and stumbled off to be forgiven, when the house received them back with its gratefully uncluttered hallway, when Tux yawned at them like a curator closing a museum, when the light in the downstairs bathroom held again because that is who it had decided to be, he went upstairs and took the chain from the door and put it back and took it again and then left it on. He wrote a note that said, Door is on the chain. I am not locking you out; I am inviting you to reach, and he did not sign it, because the point of a signature is sometimes to remind yourself of a name and sometimes to accept that other people remember it for you. He slept and dreamed of bolts that weighed exactly what they should, and woke ready to check if the planes were honest.\n\nIn the days after, the house developed a new habit of placing little objects where he could not quite remember leaving them but had to admit he might have: a washer on the edge of the kitchen sink, a ribbon in the bathroom drawer, a button as dark as a joke on the windowsill. He collected them in a small ceramic bowl shaped like a leaf someone had made in a class with a single kiln, because it seemed polite to provide a landing. He wrote no new letters to M and still received one or two, less directive, more companion. One said, You are allowed to be patient without making it an accomplishment. One said, Good. Keep loving the wrong hill; it knows your name. He kept them without feeling like a museum. He told Julian, finally, about the notes; he did it in the car because he trusted that the trees would spin past and eat any excess melodrama. Julian listened and did not ask for proof and did not make a joke and did not make a chart; he put his hand on the gearshift and said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and then a minute later said, \u201cOkay,\u201d again, and that was the exact blessing he had wanted without knowing how to ask for it.\n\nThey went back to Laurel Acres and counted in silence, and when he missed a plane, when the bead went missing and did not return to its strand, he felt the old tug and then, like a muscle he had been building without seeing it, he felt the new ease arrive to help. He breathed and did not call it an achievement. He turned his face to the not-quite-right hill and leaned back on his elbows and watched a family try to eat sandwiches on a blanket that had decided it would rather be a cape. The geese gathered anyway in parentheses and scolded the bread for not being allowed. The town moved around them in its jughandle logic. The air smelled like lemon and tomato and the inside of a Wawa and the paper they wrap thread in when they love you a little. He did not practice leaving. He practiced staying, which is the heavier thing and, when done correctly, the good one.Chapter 8\n\nThe heat came in like an acquaintance who had promised to call first and didn\u2019t. It tipped its chin at the lawn and the lawn lay down in apology. The hill at Laurel Acres bleached, all the little greens deciding to agree to be one color to make the sky feel less alone. Inside the house, doors swelled as if remembering some old irritation they\u2019d had with being rectangles. Elaine kept the windows at half-mast as if obeying a maritime ritual, which in its own way she was; the house had its flags and she had learned their meanings. The chain on Cornelius\u2019s door began to feel like jewelry on a person who doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re fancy enough to wear it. He touched it in the mornings, making sure the metal remembered how to be a boundary without being punitive. The sash weight in the corner did honest work, reminding the room what down meant. He moved slower, which felt like a luxury and a surrender, and also like something Dr. Vale would call a practice if he brought it to them with a bow.\n\nJulian started the job the way you start a book you were assigned in school and then realize you would have read anyway. He came home with stories about Reggie who had opinions about the right way to eat a hoagie and would fight you with his napkin if you said \u201csub,\u201d and about Shaila who organized the flow of information with the ferocity of a headmistress that children adore in secret. The database, he said, had been a neglected garden with labels that had given up; he liked weeding, it turned out. He brought home a stress ball the shape of a house given out by some vendor and they took turns squeezing it until it developed the resigned expression of a person who has agreed to be a metaphor. In the mornings they met in the Wawa lot with the sleep still standing behind their ears and traded coffees like keys. On good days, the light was the color of a fresh towel and the planes were already up and practicing. On bad days, the parking lot had the personality of an old bruise and they practiced anyway.\n\nThe house conspired to need them. There was a leak in the upstairs bathroom that began as a tiny dark petal in the ceiling over the hallway, the kind of petal you think is a shadow until you look away and come back and it has a border. Cornelius stood under it with his arms crossed because sometimes your posture is part of your toolkit. He remembered the main shutoff because Mr. Dwyer had taught him with the seriousness of a man who had once thought he could fix grief with an adjustable wrench and had found, to his surprise, that water responds better than sorrow does. He went to the basement and found, on the wooden shelf where they kept the things no one can bear to throw away, a folded note. The paper was a torn corner of a paint sample card, the color labeled CLOUD QUILT. The neat handwriting said, Turn the water off at the main while you still want to. \u2014M. It did not sting him, which was either the heat or maturity. He called up to Julian and said, \u201cTrip to the shutoff,\u201d and Julian said, \u201cAye aye,\u201d because he believed in ritual even when the ritual involved an old valve and a disagreement with a pipe.\n\nThey saved the ceiling from becoming a map of a country at war with rivers. The plumber came and affirmed things in a tone that suggested he liked being the authority only because water did not talk back to him in human voices. He praised Cornelius for turning the water off \u201cbefore the event,\u201d which made Cornelius think of weather and the way it is always happening even when you are ignoring it out of self-care. He did not show the plumber the note. He did not show anyone the note. He put it in his wallet because dissenting from help is a weakness he was trying to starvingly feed until it lost interest.\n\nMr. Dwyer took the leak as a personal insult and, therefore, an opportunity. He came over with a ladder that had a dent like a memory of a small mistake, and he insisted on climbing it though Elaine made noises like the understudy to a Greek chorus. \u201cI have been up a ladder since Nixon,\u201d he announced. \u201cI know gravity better than she knows me.\u201d He used a patch compound like frosting and then measured the spot with his eye as if it owed him symmetry as back rent. When they were done, he sat at the kitchen table and drank water like medicine and said, \u201cThere is a word for the feeling of looking at a ceiling and knowing it is lying. My grandmother had it, but it was in Polish,\u201d and then he stared into his glass and waited to see if the word would migrate to English to spare him effort. It did not.\n\nOn a Saturday when the heat pretended to be a necessary personality trait, Mae convinced him to go to the library for a repair caf\u00e9, which is what you call it when people bring their broken toasters and chairs and tougher things and sit in a room full of other people\u2019s skills. The library\u2019s meeting room had that bright institutional sadness that makes certain kinds of hope look more serious. There were card tables with sewing machines and card tables with screwdrivers and card tables with glue guns that had given up on knowing what glue prefers. Mae stood behind a table with screws organized by heads and sizes, and a tray of washers that looked like a coin collection for a country that had refused to be minted properly. \u201cGive me a hinge and I\u2019ll give you a rumor,\u201d she said. \u201cBring me a latch and I\u2019ll tell you who it was guarding.\u201d He took a chair that had a lilt in one leg and showed it that you could be honest with wood and not be a bully. He liked watching hands solve things. He liked watching faces relax into usefulness.\n\n\u201cCornelius,\u201d Mae said in the middle of the afternoon, as if she were calling his name to take attendance in a class he had enrolled in by accident. She handed him a small tin with a ship on it. Inside were three antique screws, one with threads that had barely survived their century. Underneath them was a folded paper that had once been a receipt for exactly twelve onions. The neat handwriting said, You are not an emergency. You can leave a thing broken until it tells you it\u2019s ready to return to being a thing. \u2014M. He looked at Mae and she lifted one eyebrow in a movement so small it might have been a stretch. He put the note with his others. He gave the chair back to the lady whose husband stood behind her with a posture that admitted to being the cause, and he let himself feel the enormity of small salvations in a room with fliers about summer reading crinkling with humidity.\n\nDr. Vale had replaced the photograph of the plant with a living cactus the exact green of a traffic light that is never for you. \u201cA client insisted,\u201d they said when he cocked his head. \u201cThey told me I needed a thing that knew how to mind its own water. I agreed. I can only hope it will respect the acoustics.\u201d They wore a linen shirt that had surrendered after the first hour of the day and had settled into honesty. He brought them the notes and they did not pretend to be anything but delighted by the font of his life. \u201cThe chain is doing its job,\u201d they said. \u201cIt is letting you perform the very human act of both wanting and pausing. Pausing is not refusal; it is courtship. With yourself, yes, but also with anyone who thinks they know you before the second paragraph.\u201d\n\nHe told them about Julian\u2019s job and how the apartment in his head where pride lived had suddenly installed proper lighting. He told them about the repair caf\u00e9 and the woman with a toaster that had stopped trying because someone had asked it to make bread into a personality. He did not tell them about the ache that lived next to his best feelings like a polite roommate, always brewing tea a little too loudly in the morning. They asked him to notice where in his body he felt it when he believed he was not an emergency. He noticed it in his wrists. He noticed it in his ankles. He noticed that he stopped clenching his teeth when he remembered that pausing is not the same as losing your place.\n\nElaine, post-wedding, needed a project that wasn\u2019t called \u201cpost-wedding.\u201d She tried on the mantle of Relaxed Person and found it hung strange on her shoulders. She cleaned the candleholders until they could have passed the viewing-yourself-in-them test at any department store. She washed curtains. She considered a wall she had always considered paintable and then said, \u201cNo,\u201d aloud in a decisive soprano. It was Rick, for once, who suggested they start a supper thing. \u201cPeople bring food,\u201d he said. \u201cWe light the candles, which is your church.\u201d Elaine called it Thursday and refused to give it a name, because names lead to responsibilities and she was experimenting with a week that didn\u2019t scold her. On the first Thursday, six people came, and another one came because they had heard laughter when they walked their dog. Mr. Dwyer brought a salad with fennel and the confidence of a man who believes in his knife. Julian made a pasta that turned out better because he stopped talking to it. Cornelius made beans with lemon and garlic and called it a dinner as if the name conferred adequacy. When they sat down, Elaine said, \u201cGrief sits at this table. That\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll feed it, too.\u201d No one argued. The house recorded the evening in the scrapings of forks like a musician taking notes at a concert.\n\nThe planes changed their routes for a week. Somebody somewhere decided the sky needed a haircut. They no longer came in a tidy blackout-drill line from the northeast but sidled in from the west as if embarrassed by their own angles. It ruined counting for a day and then made it better, because counting is not about correctness if you are honest; it is about believing you can distinguish one thing from another and then forgiving yourself when you cannot. Cornelius sat on the wrong hill with Julian and discovered that he could say, \u201cMissed,\u201d without feeling that the sky had done it to punish him. He could say, \u201cThere are more beads than I can see,\u201d and mean it as an invitation instead of an apology.\n\nRick left for a few days to see his father, whose lungs had decided to declare independence. He packed with the theater of a man who never packs but did not overdo it, which is its own victory. He hugged Julian in the doorway with an awkwardness that made them both newly dear to the house. He squeezed Cornelius\u2019s shoulder with a punctuation that did not require decoding. He called from a hospital room with his voice hovering between public and private volume, and Elaine answered with her table voice asked to do hospital duty. The house went quiet in the way a mouth goes quiet when someone reads it a poem. Tux slept in the doorway of the downstairs bathroom with her paws tucked under as if she were holding her own patience. The light held.\n\nOn a wet afternoon when steam rose from the street like the town thinking, he sat at the kitchen table alone and put all the notes in a line. They made a line the way flight paths make lines if you draw them long enough. This is me, he thought, with the private comedy he trusted because it did not aim for applause. This is me when I was generous with myself. This is me when I was trying to leave breadcrumbs so good I would pretend to be obligated to follow them. He wrote on a clean index card, because all systems require at least one clean page, I hear you. I am practicing without you for a week. This is not punishment. This is posture. He put the card under the sugar bowl which had always thought it was important anyway. He left it there. He drank his tea unsweet for a day and discovered it was not a moral achievement; it was a taste.\n\nThe first night without notes he could feel where the air had been impressed by their absence. He checked his pockets before bed and found only lint and a penny that had seen war. He put his lip to the chain as if he could hear more with the mouth. He slept. He woke and found no paper under his pillow, no napkin under the fruit, no small writing with its neat right angles. He went downstairs and made toast the way a person does when they try to keep their mind from narrating. He checked the fridge. There was only butter and a small civilization of leftovers and a magnet in the shape of Delaware doing its duty. He felt relief without a witness and decided it counted.\n\nHe saw Mae in the store, aisle seven, where people come to argue with shower rods. She put a shower caddy in her basket and then took it out and then put it back as if practicing choices. \u201cThe notes stop,\u201d she said, not asking and not asserting, and he marveled again at the way some people talk like they are in on a secret you don\u2019t remember telling. He nodded. She looked pleased for him the way a person looks pleased about another person\u2019s haircut even when they know the person will hate it for three days and then grow into their skull. \u201cYou will not miss your own handwriting,\u201d she said. \u201cThat happens later.\u201d She put the caddy back and left with a pack of hooks and a small bit of string. He could have asked her, then, but he had already decided to respect the week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the chain rattled. It was not loud; it was the sound you make with your throat when you consider speaking. He was in his room folding laundry in that precise way that makes shirts forget they are fabric and become a problem to solve. He turned. Tux was in the hall, sitting like a person waiting for an apology. The chain trembled and then lay still. He walked to the door and put his hand against it the way you press your palm to glass at zoos and then hate yourself a little for doing it. He said, \u201cI am here,\u201d because he was. The door said nothing. He opened it and found the hallway unchanged, the carpet doing its unheroic job, the small gouge near the baseboard where someone had once moved a table too optimistically to the left. He closed the door and the chain fell back into place with the comfortable sound of a thing choosing its old job over a new ambition. He put the clean shirts away and let his chest keep discussing it while he ignored them.\n\nOn Friday, he did an unforgivable thing. He forgot a bolt. He lifted a small package in aisle ten and believed by the weight that it was fine. He took it to the shelf where it belonged because the old map in his head still listed what belongs where, and three steps later, a feeling like being called by a teacher who had noticed you\u2019d been standing without a reason turned him back. He weighed it again, and it was wrong. Not wrong like grief; wrong like math. He replaced it in the correct place and said, out loud and to himself, \u201cIt happens,\u201d and in that moment the week of no notes turned into a habit instead of a dare. He put his hands on the edge of the shelf the way he puts his hands on the table at home, and he did not shoo his heart away when it tried to jump up and prove how helpful it could be.\n\nOn Saturday, the sky broke. It used rain like a proof. They drove to the hill anyway because it had become the choreography of their friendship. They sat in the car with the windows fogging in symmetrical ovals like thought bubbles you could never be brave enough to write in. The park filled with people who don\u2019t mind water and ducks who did and geese who have elected not to participate in anyone else\u2019s narrative. Julian reached over without ceremony and adjusted the vent so it would blow on both their hands, and their fingers nearly touched and nearly didn\u2019t. The nose of the car filled with the fleeting smell of something electrical that had not quite committed to failing. \u201cI dreamed last night we were counting trains,\u201d Julian said. \u201cThey came upside down and nobody minded.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dreamed your database got tired of being a bouquet and wanted to be a tree,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cIt grew dates like fruit. We had to decide if picking them was murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery Catholic of you,\u201d Julian said, startling a laugh out of both of them. He pressed his thumb against the dashboard as if somewhere under there was a button marked Better Weather. \u201cI like the week you gave yourself. I was worried you\u2019d turn it into a creed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can make a creed out of anything,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cThis week I did not. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\nThey went home and someone had left a pie on their front step in a box with a ribbon like an apology in advance. The note on top had been written by a neighbor who calls everyone by their whole name; it said, Congratulations on being the kind of house where mail does not lie. The pie was blueberry, which made Julian make a small delighted noise in a register that belonged to cartoons. They ate it with forks directly from the tin because some Saturdays require the vote of the house and the house had voted for this. Elaine found them and said, \u201cI see you have become pirates,\u201d and took a fork and joined them without lying about wanting a plate. When they were three-quarters done, Cornelius folded the top crust over like a duvet and said, \u201cOne more piece,\u201d and then did not take it. The luxury of not finishing a thing felt like being trusted with a small relative.\n\nOn the last day of the week, there was a note. It was not in the kitchen or under his pillow or behind the butter which, in summer, had become a person. It was on the stairs window, taped gently with that blue painter\u2019s tape that has never harmed anyone. The handwriting was still neat and still his. It said, Thank you. I did not vanish when you did not call me. You can have me and also have you. \u2014M. He put his nail under the corner of the tape and then lowered his hand because leaving a thing up when you do not absolutely need to take it down is a skill. He leaned his forehead against the glass. The window gave him back the heat of the day softened by evening and whatever you call the temperature of a thought when it has just become less punishing.\n\nHe could have told Dr. Vale. He could have told Mae. He could have told Julian the way he had told him about the previous notes, in the car, with the trees obliging their need for a moving confessional. He did not, not immediately. He went instead to the store and held a handful of washers and let them clink into each other like a tiny polite applause. He took the sash weight down into the hall because the air downstairs had taken to shifting when no one turned the fan on, and he wanted to remind the house of consequences gently. He stood at the base of the stairs and thought about the door with the chain and the day with the pie and the way he had said, \u201cIt happens,\u201d in the aisle. He stood there until Tux came and sat on his foot, and then he stood another minute because he liked the weight.\n\nAt night they lay in the living room again because it had become a position their bodies knew without instruction. The ceiling did its striping trick with the streetlight the way a grandmother does the same card trick every holiday and it is still good. The television showed them a movie where people regret things in airport bars. They turned the sound off at the part where someone said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d because they did. Julian said, \u201cI keep thinking about the way your house sounds like it\u2019s about to tell a a joke,\u201d and Cornelius said, \u201cSometimes it does. Sometimes it only wants to hear if I can laugh.\u201d There was quiet. It was not a test. It was a room where two people had decided to be and were being, with a cat on the back of the couch who would never approve but would always admit to preferring this to a version of the night in which no one was where she could observe them.\n\nThe next day, the planes came back to their old line the way a person returns to the route they had known was shorter all along. He and Julian sat on the wrong hill and did the right thing. They counted. They missed. They counted again. Behind them a father told his child an elaborate lie about geese being secret employees of the park whose job was quality control, and Cornelius admired the impulse and the vocabulary and the wrongness. In his pocket, a folded square of blue tape had adhered to the lining as if asking to be taken along in case of sudden note emergencies. He did not write. He did not forbid writing. He watched the small silver wedges announce their intention without asking to be named. He pressed his hand into the grass and felt the old carpet feel of it, cool and matted by other choices. He allowed himself, then, a specific thought that would have embarrassed him a year earlier: there would be more beads. There would be days when he counted them wrong and liked the counting anyway. There would be a chain and a door and a note that said nothing and still spoke. There would be, and he could stay for it.Chapter 9\n\nThe storm announced itself with the manners of a guest who texts you from your driveway rather than ringing the bell. The clouds stacked over the highway like furniture you promised you could carry alone. Late afternoon had that sepia bruise you remember from a childhood afternoon when someone told you thunder was angels bowling and you resented the trivialization of noise. The weather app lied in its precise way and then took it back with an update as if admitting it never really meant it. By the time Cornelius left the store, the parking lot had become a reflective surface for other people\u2019s lives and his own, and the men who sell roofing out of vans were blessing themselves with tarps.\n\nAt home, the house drew itself small. Elaine went room to room closing windows to the exact half she had been advised to keep them, because ritual offers traction. Rick called twice to say he could see the storm from the expressway as if clouds would behave better if spoken to sternly on speakerphone. Tux took up her position on the fourth stair, the one that had learned to translate vibrations into gossip. Julian came in with the smell of damp denim and the particular brightness you get when you have walked fast through fat drops without bending your head, and they did that thing where they narrated the weather to each other as if the sky craved commentary.\n\nWhen the power went out, it was the kind of silence that reveals a dozen other noises. The refrigerator\u2019s secrecy became obvious by its lack; the aquarium at the neighbor\u2019s that no one in the house had ever seen but everyone had heard stopped doing its endless river impersonation; the little clock on the microwave forgot its numbers with relief. Somewhere down the block a child cheered as if a goal had been scored. The rain repositioned itself as the main character.\n\nElaine lit candles because Thursday was over but the table did not know it. Her lighter clicked the way doubts do when they attempt competence. The house accepted the flicker with a grace that suggested it remembered when light was twitchier. \u201cNo opening the fridge,\u201d she said, and then opened the fridge to check on the pie and apologized to it with a hand on the door as if to a startled animal. Rick, stranded in Cherry Hill with weather as his alibi, texted an emoji that looked grimly optimistic and then a paragraph about generators that sounded like a warm-hearted threat.\n\nThey gathered in the living room because it had the most breathable dark. Outside, the sky cracked open, not the clean line of a break but a rip as if something too large insisted on squeezing through. The streetlight did its own small martyrdom and then nothing. The house exhaled the lemon cleaner smell it had been hoarding in the baseboards since morning and, beneath that, the ordinary scent of their lives: onion bagels, wet socks, tea rings, Mr. Dwyer\u2019s particular cologne which he swore was a soap.\n\n\u201cDo we count the thunder,\u201d Julian asked, sprawled on the floor with his hands behind his head like a person demonstrating that you could live here, in this moment, without convincing anyone.\n\n\u201cYou count for distance,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cI count for company.\u201d He lay beside him, close enough to feel the version of heat that is simply another body being permitted to exist near yours. He could hear Julian breathe and could hear his own breath trying to match and failing, and he let it fail for once without calling it a problem. Tux patrolled the border between them like a lifeguard in an era when swimming was suspicious.\n\nA knock came, the polite kind, like rain had learned table manners. Mae stood on the porch with a lantern of the old-fashioned battery variety and a raincoat whose hood made her look like someone being smuggled into a better story. \u201cI brought these,\u201d she said, handing over two lanterns as if offering time for their use. \u201cAnd this,\u201d and she produced a roll of blue tape. \u201cFor leaving messages you aren\u2019t ready to find.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a sense of humor,\u201d Julian said, grinning, because he liked discovering other people\u2019s tools.\n\n\u201cI borrow it,\u201d she said. Her hair had found rain in a way that made all other waters seem implausible. She looked past them into the house with the respectful interest of someone entering a gallery. \u201cYour windows are doing their best.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tell them that,\u201d Elaine said, taking the lanterns with thanks that sounded like a little hymn. \u201cYou could stay,\u201d she added, as if the offer had been pre-agreed by the walls.\n\n\u201cI would, but my cat does not believe in democracy,\u201d Mae said. \u201cAlso, my neighbor thinks this is the best weather for telling you about his knees.\u201d She touched the blue tape to her knuckle and then peeled it away in a gesture that felt ceremonial. \u201cKeep your chain on. Lightning is a door with no respect for invitations.\u201d She disappeared into the rain with the purposeful gait of people who believe in the concept of elsewhere.\n\nThey placed the lanterns on the mantle and the floor, and the light they made was the kind that forgives dust. The storm settled into its work: long bellies of thunder rolling tight against each other, white veins of light writing with bad grammar. The house made its corresponding sounds, small sympathetic creaks like affirmations. Cornelius listened for voices the way a person listens for their name in a crowd and heard, for once, none. The quiet felt earned rather than ominous.\n\nJulian read to them from the house book, Chapter Whatever, his voice even and a little amused at the author\u2019s earnestness, and the sentences did useful work, telling them about porches that remember feet and thresholds that document loyalties. Elaine dozed with her mouth just open enough to be human; Tux took this opportunity to inspect her face as if betrayed by its unguardedness. A gust pushed its broad hand against the front door in a way that made the chain identify itself out loud.\n\nWhen the storm had moved on to flatter places to impress, the house let its muscles go. They didn\u2019t talk about weather the way you talk about people after they leave; they passed around the topic like a bowl and then set it down. The power returned in fits\u2014one attempt that made the refrigerator clear its throat, a second that convinced the hallway light to cough, and finally a steady thrum that made the microwave proud again. The lanterns were turned off with a pat each, the way you treat small animals.\n\nIn bed, Cornelius listened to the water complaining in the gutter downspouts and to the small, reliable lie of rain after storm telling you it had always had proportion. He put his hand on the chain as if it were a stethoscope. He did not expect a note after his week without; he expected the feeling of not expecting, which is a complicated thing to hold under your tongue. In the morning there was no paper, only a faint crescent where condensation had dried in the exact place his forehead had rested against the stairs window during some other version of himself. He counted that, too.\n\nIn the following days, the town wore its storm habits like a cardigan. Branches arranged themselves into narratives across sidewalks. The man with the dog on Berkley cut the leaves with the seriousness of trimming a bad haircut. On Church Road, the office where Dr. Vale lived had a dark stripe up its stucco belly like a fight it had decided not to win. The cactus in the waiting room looked older as if thunder ages spines. \u201cWe survived drama,\u201d Dr. Vale said, tipping their head at the plant. \u201cI am not saying it liked it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hate it,\u201d Cornelius said, surprising himself with the admission. He sat and felt the exact rectangle where the lantern had rested on the carpet as if it had imprinted something into his body. \u201cIt made me honest. I didn\u2019t miss a bead for a while.\u201d He told them about the lanterns and the blue tape and the lack of voices, about lightning as rude doors and the chain feeling purposeful rather than medicinal.\n\nDr. Vale stretched in their chair, the vertebrae doing a miniature version of rain on a porch roof. \u201cAbsence can be a presence,\u201d they said. \u201cI am told monks have known this for some time. My experience with monks is limited to a bakery, but their advice on bread and sorrow tends to check out.\u201d They pointed their chin gently toward him. \u201cWhat would it be like if the notes were company and not instructions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am practicing that,\u201d he said. \u201cI even ate pie from the tin without asking permission.\u201d He told them about the neighbor\u2019s ribbon and the sensation of not finishing on purpose. \u201cI think I\u2019m trying to do everything slower, but not like a virtue. More like a temperature.\u201d\n\n\u201cRooms have their own climate,\u201d they said. \u201cYou\u2019re allowing the house to set you rather than the other way around. I approve. Don\u2019t let it bully you into humidity.\u201d\n\nWork became a minor Eden after the storm in the way that people who move boxes for a living know to be grateful for: the power had not gone out in their section of the strip mall, the backup generator had performed as intended, and the air inside had the blessed consistency of a refrigerator. The bolts were themselves again, proudly standardized in heft. A customer came in looking for a very particular washer and brought with him the smell of a house full of books and a cat. \u201cThis one,\u201d Cornelius said after three honest tries, placing in the man\u2019s palm the ring of metal that knew itself. \u201cYou can tell because it resists being needed.\u201d The man laughed and said he had never met a washer he didn\u2019t suffer for, and Cornelius experienced the odd pleasure of being someone else\u2019s reliable story by dinnertime.\n\nJulian started to keep a list of things he liked at his new job and taped it to the inside of a kitchen cabinet where no one would see but everyone might feel: the precise way the scanner warms up, Shaila\u2019s whistle when she thinks no one can hear her, the smell of old paper when the humidity changes, the sense that data can forgive if courted properly, the one decrepit ficus near the back exit trying to join the conversation. He showed it to Cornelius over toast and then half-apologized by calling it corny and then took the apology back because some mornings he could see which words were unnecessary and unkind to himself.\n\nElaine\u2019s Thursday grew in rings like a tree of appetite. The third week, a woman who had not been invited came with carrot salad and an apology that had been through three drafts. She sat and talked about gutters as if the word required accompaniment, and by the end of the night she had told them the kind of story that usually gets a person asked to leave rooms, and no one asked her to. The house takes on tasks when the people inside it let it, and on Thursdays, this house learned how to be a soft place on purpose.\n\nMr. Dwyer fell off a ladder and did it with enough flourish to make a parable. It was not a high ladder and he had not been warned by cherubs. He had gone up to retrieve a frying pan from the top of his pantry, where he kept things that made him feel secure for their inaccessibility, and the fourth rung had admitted to years. He came down wrong, that plain violent phrase, and sat down in his kitchen like a man who has decided to try sitting in other parts of the house for variety. He called no one because he had been born in an era that taught men wounds were personal curiosities. He walked over two hours later, his pride unrumpled, and stood in the doorway with a forearm he insisted was \u201conly dramatic.\u201d\n\nElaine sent him to urgent care with a tone that could make butter set. He returned with a sling and instructions to overthink nothing and ibuprofen in a bottle that looked like a small, cheerless building. He accepted both like knighthoods. Cornelius fixed the frying pan handle because some acts of care are better expressed in torque. \u201cI don\u2019t like the sensation of being advised,\u201d Mr. Dwyer confessed, rotating his shoulder as if the words could oil it. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s the age.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdvice isn\u2019t a verdict,\u201d Cornelius said, and Mr. Dwyer made a face that suggested this sentence fit in his wallet.\n\nMae began to exist in the corners of his week the way a refrain realizes it\u2019s a chorus. He saw her at the library one evening when he went to return the house book because someone else should be allowed to be told that windows get tired. She stood with a teenage boy, demonstrating how to reattach the cover to a paperback with cloth tape and love. The boy pretended not to care and then cared. She saw Cornelius and raised her hand like a pledge in reverse. They exchanged nothing that looked like confession. Later, he found a blue-taped square on the outside of the library\u2019s automatic door with neat handwriting: Doors that open themselves also deserve thanks. \u2014M. He did not peel it up. The thought of strangers walking in and being made more polite warmed a part of him that had been cold since he was eight, when he first understood that public kindness was both rare and contagious.\n\nOn a bright and unambitious Sunday, the planes were aggressive with their punctuality. They made their line like an arpeggio you are proud to know by name. He and Julian sat on the wrong hill with the right reactions. Teenagers slid down the grass on flattened boxes because youth is a series of experiments in friction. A small girl in a yellow dress described the sky to a patient aunt as if auditioning to be weather. \u201cYou count,\u201d Julian said between sips of the coffee that now had his mouth belonging to a particular morning. \u201cI\u2019ll conduct.\u201d\n\nCornelius counted. He let himself get lost twice and then found himself once and considered the math fair. He said the numbers out loud because the numbers liked it. When he reached one and nothing arrived, the old sensation of the bead skipping its turn rose and then, like someone careful on stairs, lowered itself. He breathed for two counts longer than felt intuitive and the next plane presented its silver intention and he nodded to it as to a neighbor with good fences.\n\n\u201cI saw your list,\u201d he said to Julian. \u201cIn the cabinet. I think you are allowed to like things without hiding them in cupboards. For next time.\u201d He did not blush or apologize; it was a sentence you could inhabit standing up.\n\nJulian turned his head, his mouth doing that half-considering thing that reminded Cornelius of gentle hinges. \u201cI\u2019m trained to believe that liking things gets you mocked. It is a school event.\u201d\n\n\u201cChoose different students,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cInvite yourself to a nicer lunch table.\u201d\n\nThey did not hold hands. They did not need to prove anything to a hill. A breeze found the exact spot where Cornelius\u2019s shirt didn\u2019t meet his skin and made the kind of suggestion you agree to. He turned his face into it and thought of the chain as jewelry again, and the sash weight in the corner of his room reciting its single poem, and the blue tape folded in his wallet in case of emergency gratitude.\n\nThe store needed him because a man had bought the wrong anchors and blamed the wall. The man had a vein in his forehead like an underlined word. He said the word \u201cquality\u201d like it owed him back rent. Cornelius thought of posting a sign in the aisle: It is not a sin to change plans. He took the man to the proper package and exchanged nothing but competence. After the man left, Dina from returns said, \u201cYou\u2019re good at making people less embarrassing,\u201d and he accepted the praise into his ledger under the category Useful.\n\nIn the evening, he and Elaine rebuilt a drawer. It had lived a hard life with the previous family, whose child had been an early years drummer. The bottom had shrugged under the weight of T-shirts and worry. They bought new bottom, as Mr. Dwyer insisted on saying, and slid it into place with a relief that made the room exhale. Elaine told him, over the discovery of a long-lost sock that predated the house, that she dreamed lately of trains and of everyone they had ever been standing on a platform politely waiting for the correct self to arrive. \u201cWe were all wearing similar coats,\u201d she said, smiling as if at a bad chorus line that had tried bravely. \u201cI like that. It means if I get the wrong one, it will still keep me warm.\u201d\n\nHe found a note that night not in his room or the kitchen or the civilized interior of his wallet but in the car, under the passenger seat, where it had collected crumbs and a small square of sun. The neat handwriting had withstood ash and grit. It read, You can let yourself be touched by what you like without giving it your keys. \u2014M. He folded it, toasted by heat and car, and slid it into the crack behind the radio as if returning it to the God of Dashboard.\n\nOn Tuesday, he forgot again. Not a bolt this time, but an hour. He looked at the clock and it stood at a precise time he had lived a hundred times and then it didn\u2019t, and the next thing he knew, he was rinsing tea mugs with the practiced circular motion his body employs when alone. He checked his phone: no calls made, no messages sent, no orders placed. He checked his pockets: one washer, a receipt with onions\u2014always onions\u2014priced at a number that made him laugh, and a blue tape square with a corner folded as if indicating a book he would revisit. He did not panic. He sat on the bottom stair and let the house speak in its harmless bones. He did a thing he had seen children do when they realize they have not been paying attention in class: he wrote by hand the words Here and Now on his palm and did not mind if anyone saw. Julian came in, saw, grinned, and wrote Here and Later on his own hand, lower down, just above where your life line is rumored to make deals.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Julian said, sitting with him so their knees thought about each other politely. \u201cTell me one small thing, and then two, that anchored in that hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteam on the sink,\u201d Cornelius said immediately, grateful for the game as if it were fruit. \u201cThe way the towel decided to be a river. A plane turned too slowly,\u201d he added, closing his eyes to see it better, \u201cand became something else and then back, like acting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s three,\u201d Julian said. \u201cOverachiever. See? You were alive.\u201d\n\nThey went to the Wawa and did not make it an event. The parking lot had the mood of a Monday even though it was not. A man in a suit practiced sincerity on a phone near the air pump. The woman at the register had on glitter eyeliner like apology for the concept of convenience stores at the hour when people lose their stamina. They bought two apples and two coffees and a bag of pretzels pretending to be crafted. On the way out, someone behind them said \u201cMae?\u201d in the now familiar register, a dim hall calling, but the person who turned was wearing a shirt that said STANFORD with all the letters intact and had a ponytail that apologized for nothing. He could feel the part of him that might have turned anyway growing used to the petting of that voice. He let it go. He could let many things go and not become less.\n\nHis mother, post-wedding, post-Thursday, began to take naps. She did it with shame first, and then with competence, and finally with pride. She lay on the couch and threw an arm over her face in the universal posture of brave surrender, and the house played the soft opera of plates settling so she would not feel unaccompanied. Rick attempted the learning of naps and failed, his naps becoming meetings with himself that overshot their agenda. \u201cI will get there,\u201d he told the cat, who had never tried a thing she did not already know she was good at.\n\nThere was a Sunday\u2014they were accruing, he was saving them\u2014when the hill received them with particular hospitality. The grass had recovered its plurality of greens. The planes made their music without needing to be named, and the toddlers were excellent ships. They lay back and watched the tops of trees move like gossip among old friends. \u201cTell me,\u201d Julian said, \u201csomething you could never have said a year ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like not knowing,\u201d Cornelius said, and each word embarrassed him separately and then they did their teamwork and embarrassed him less. He put his hands behind his head because honesty is treated better by the body in that position. \u201cEverything was neat when I was frightened. Now some things are in piles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like your piles,\u201d Julian said. \u201cThey\u2019re tidy enough to prove you mean it.\u201d\n\nThey did not kiss. They did exercise their right to stay in the exact emotional place they had sailed to with their own arms. It was not laziness. It was seamanship. In the parking lot, on their way to the car, Cornelius stopped short and pointed at a plane that wasn\u2019t one: a small kite in the shape of a stingray moving with insolent agreement with the sky. \u201cI want that,\u201d he said, which was either a sentence about toys or the kind of declaration you make eight months into practicing wanting things that might be allowed to happen.\n\nThey bought a kite. The day had made room for it. The string trembled in his fingers in a way that made him think of old jewelry. He let the wind tell it who it was. He looked, only once, down at the ground to make sure the hill did not resent him for preferring the air for a second, and the hill looked amused at his need for approval and told him to go on. The kite rode the seam between performance and flight and he did not correct it. Julian held the string when asked and did not let it go even when his hands stung in that clean way you remember when your skin has begged not to be useless. They brought it down in the slow deliberate motion that belongs to both surgeons and bakers and men who are allowed to keep pleasure for later.\n\nThat night, he found on the stairs window a smear where a finger had written and wiped and written again. It caught him because the evening had turned the glass into a chalkboard. He touched the spot and felt the cooled outline of a vowel. He breathed on the glass and the word arrived, a negative, a ghost of graphite: Stay. It was not signed. It did not need to be. He laughed, not loudly, just enough to make his ribs say, Yes, this. He put no blue tape around it. He did not show anyone immediately. In the morning it was gone, and he liked that the house had a broom for such things, and that whoever had written it believed he was the kind of person who would obey without keeping evidence pinned under glass.\n\nIn the small, serious hours when the store was closed and the refrigerator woke up to complain in the way of appliances whose owners had spoken to them rudely, he woke with a feeling as precise as a phone alarm. He lay there and let it ring. He did not get up. He did not go find paper. He put his hand out into the dark until he found the sash weight, hung where it belonged now, a dark sentence at the corner of the room. He closed his fingers around it briefly, and felt the correctness of the cold, and heard, somewhere inside himself where cheap metaphors go to die and good ones resurrect, the smooth click of something seating into threads exactly made for it. He slept after that with the basic gratitude of a person who can tell the difference between heavy and bad and has proof in his palm and the wrong hill outside doing its right job whether anyone thanked it or not.",

                              "content": "Cornelius liked to sit on the hill at Laurel Acres Park and count the planes moving across the dusk. They made a gentle, stuttering line toward the northeast, a strand of slow beads pulled by a quiet string. The geese gathered like parentheses by the water. The park had the smell he always connected with Mount Laurel after rain\u2014wet pavement and red clay, the faint sugar of decaying leaves even in spring, a ribbon of car exhaust from Church Street. And the benches had a complaint to them when you sat down, the boards making a noise he could feel in his teeth. He took off his shoes because the grass felt like the old carpeting in his grandmother\u2019s hallway, flat and cool and slightly matted where people always walked.\n\nHe was not alone, though he had trained himself to look that way\u2014chin down, hoodie up, quiet. He carried the ghost of a grocery list in one pocket and the parking lot grit of Wawa in the cuffs of his jeans. He had the awkward hands of someone who had worked in the same big-box store for more years than made sense and could close his eyes and count out twenty bolts by weight. He turned his phone over and over, watched the screen glow, then blacken. He liked the feeling of predicting when the next plane would appear before it did, counting down from five in his head and then seeing that small silver wedge. Only when he reached one with nothing in the sky did he let himself shift, let himself breathe deeper. The world was a test; he wanted a high score.\n\n\u201cCorny,\u201d someone called, and the name slid down the hill like a marble.\n\nHe looked up. The wind pressed the hood to the shape of his head for a second, and in that moment he recognized the outline of a person he had met exactly once in a parking lot off Route 38. Yellow hoodie, hair too long for a job interview, that fragile balance between handsome and tired. Julian. He stopped at the top of the hill, weighed something in the glassy eyes that looked like his father\u2019s, then put his hands in his pockets and came down with a careful side-step that said: I fall if I go straight, so I do this instead.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to call me that,\u201d Cornelius said, smiling anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the brochure. Mount Laurel, the hill park, Wawa coffee, calling you Corny to see you wince. You\u2019re like a local delicacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you just get here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOr we always lived here and didn\u2019t notice before, I can\u2019t decide.\u201d\n\nHis hands were clean. That was the first thing Cornelius always noticed about people, which made no sense. He worked around little bags of hardware and plastic wrap and sharpies and packing tape. Marks were normal. Julian\u2019s nails were clean, the palms unscuffed. It meant something. Or nothing at all.\n\n\u201cMom told me you\u2019d be here,\u201d Julian said, and the word made a shape in the air\u2014Mom\u2014that didn\u2019t fit right yet. His mother, Elaine, had laughed while stirring pasta earlier, one hand on the phone, one at the pot. \u201cHe goes there whenever he wants to think. He says he\u2019s not thinking, but you can tell.\u201d\n\nIt still felt strange, the future tense of family. Elaine was engaged to Rick, who had a son, who had a voice that was warm like toast. Cornelius had spent the afternoon pushing a flatbed cart of lamps down an aisle beneath lights that hummed like a beehive and thinking: Step-brother is a word people use in jokes. Step-brother is a job I don\u2019t know how to do. And here was the person who would make the word real.\n\nJulian dropped down beside him on the hill. They sat like two pegs in a board, not touching and not talking for a time that could have been five minutes or fifteen; Cornelius always lost sense of time at Laurel Acres. The lake made the sound of slow conversation. Across the way, a child threw bread at the geese and the geese did not care for it.\n\n\u201cHow was work?\u201d Julian asked.\n\n\u201cThe bolts were weighing less than they should.\u201d Cornelius grinned because he knew it sounded like a complaint from someone\u2019s great-uncle. \u201cNew supplier. You can tell if you hold them in two hands. The little ones, not the lag bolts. They\u2019re cheap.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a thing you can tell. Good to have a hobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a hobby. It\u2019s a talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, sorry. Your supernatural gift.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me. It\u2019s suburban telekinesis.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd useful,\u201d Julian said. \u201cYou\u2019re a quality control superhero. QC-Man. The cape has a measuring tape hem.\u201d\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have liked the conversation, and he did. He shouldn\u2019t have liked the way the sunset assembled itself in the little crease at the corner of Julian\u2019s mouth or the way he kept tapping his knee as if counting something out that he was embarrassed to admit. He\u2019d made a habit of not wanting people he had to be around. He was good at that. And yet he remembered how they had met in the Wawa parking lot, how Julian had offered him a sip of hazelnut milkshake blended with actual coffee while their parents went inside to look at wedding magazines and found the birthday card section anyway, which was always how that went. They had stood by the recycling bin and watched a giant pickup try, fail, try, succeed to back into a spot. Julian had said, \u201cI flinch for other people,\u201d and then the straw had been pressed toward Cornelius\u2019s mouth in a way that was not aggressive but also not tentative. This, he discovered, was one of the qualities he recognized in people he would have to leave: knowing exactly where to put things in other people\u2019s space and pretending they were unsure.\n\n\u201cElaine told me you like to cook,\u201d Julian said now. \u201cShe said you once made pancakes in the shapes of states.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to cook. I like to pretend I know things.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you know what, Maine? Michigan? People always try to do Texas because it\u2019s big, but the bottom part is tricky.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be tested on it,\u201d he said, and then: \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to ask if Julian called Rick \u201cDad,\u201d and then he realized there was no way to do that without sounding accusatory. He wanted to ask about Philadelphia, where Julian had been living up until last month, what made him decide to come back across the bridge at an age when most people were trying to go the other way. He wanted to ask if he believed he could start over, because Cornelius didn\u2019t, not really, except in increments so small you could mistake them for error margins. He didn\u2019t ask any of it. He watched a plane descend and meant to follow it to the ground but got distracted by a toddler in a dragon hoodie. When he looked back, the plane had vanished. A bead had gone missing. He felt suddenly anxious, as if he had misplaced an earring.\n\n\u201cI forgot to bring the thing,\u201d Julian said abruptly, as if they had had a whole conversation about a thing. \u201cI was gonna bring that book I told you about. About the guy who does repairs but also he reads buildings like people read tarot cards? The author\u2019s from here. Or Cherry Hill. That counts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can read bolts,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll like it. I\u2019ll leave it at your\u2014\u201d He caught himself, looked at the river of cars on the road beyond the park. \u201cAt Elaine\u2019s.\u201d\n\nCornelius almost corrected him. It isn\u2019t just Elaine\u2019s anymore; it\u2019s a shared house with a wall that squeaks when you lean on it and a hall light that goes out at inconvenient times and the smell of lemon cleaner even in the places you can\u2019t see. One of the funny things about a house is how it develops a social life after midnight: it shifts and knocks and breathes and calls your name in the heating vents. His room at the top of the stairs had started to say \u201cCorn\u201d\u2014just the first half, like the first tug on a sleeve.\n\nHe squinted at the lake. A couple in matching windbreakers argued in a soft way near the edge of the path. A boy\u2019s voice came from behind him and called, \u201cMae, where\u2019d you put my phone?\u201d and a woman replied, \u201cOn the bench, baby,\u201d and when Cornelius turned to look he found no one there, only the top of the hill and the wind compressing the grass into a single stripe. He did not find this strange, but then he often had a radio quality in his head\u2014people tuning in and out. He\u2019d assumed it was the kind of noise everyone had, like when you hear your name in a conversation you weren\u2019t part of. He shook it. The distant girl who called herself Mae laughed again, higher, and then she was gone.\n\n\u201cDo you remember,\u201d he asked without thinking, \u201cthe last time you fell in love?\u201d\n\nJulian glanced at him sideways and then pretended a plane was very interesting. \u201cNot a great opening question.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an opening. We\u2019ve met.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou act like I\u2019m a book you checked out and got a fine for. Yeah,\u201d he said, after a small pause that had the weight of months in it. He nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how did you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t. Not the way they tell you. It wasn\u2019t like bells. It was like waking up on the wrong couch and smelling oranges and then realizing you\u2019re wearing someone else\u2019s socks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds like bells to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you the socks,\u201d Julian said, and then laughed. \u201cNo, don\u2019t look like that. It\u2019s not dirty.\u201d\n\nHe was careful enough to say \u201clove\u201d as a topic but not as an arrow, so Cornelius\u2019s skin did not prick all over. He liked that. He liked the way Julian sat with his knees turned in slightly, his feet pressed to the ground as if the earth might, at any second, discard him.\n\nThey left before the park lights blinked on. Julian was not from Mount Laurel, not the way Cornelius was, but he had that built-in county geography all the same: he could navigate the chopped-up roads and the old joints and the way a U-turn here put you into a jughandle you didn\u2019t plan to take. They walked past a teenage couple crawling over each other on the hill and then past a man in a bright neon vest throwing a Frisbee to a dog that was clearly in retirement from Frisbee. Cornelius felt everything. He felt the pinch of his socks between his toes. He felt the coin in his pocket press a perfect circle against his thigh. He felt the muscles at the back of his neck tighten and then relax because a sound he could not identify had resolved into a train. He wanted, with blunt suddenness, to tell Julian that he was tired\u2014tired of small newnesses, tired of being in transitional spaces, tired of being watched by things that had no eyes.\n\nAt the parking lot, Julian took out his keys and fumbled them, catching them by their lanyard. \u201cI\u2019m staying tonight at the house,\u201d he said. \u201cRick\u2019s got a meeting early. And the cat\u2019s been ignoring me. I need to win Tux back.\u201d\n\n\u201cTux doesn\u2019t ignore. Tux judges.\u201d Tux was a tuxedo cat with a formal walk and an unamused mouth. She had arrived with Elaine\u2019s friend Mr. Dwyer and never left. Sometimes Mr. Dwyer still called to ask how \u201cmy daughter\u201d was doing, as if he had mislaid her in a grocery store. He showed up with casserole and advice about weather-proofing bathtubs. He installed one towel rack and then wrote a note in Sharpie on the inside of the cabinet door to remind them not to hang wet things on it.\n\n\u201cYou like my dad?\u201d Julian asked as they reached his car.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He is. He has a way of being in a room.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean to do the\u2026you know.\u201d He lifted a shoulder. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to sit in quiet places. Or he thinks the quiet will tell him something about him he doesn\u2019t want to hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be family,\u201d Cornelius said, trying out the muscles around the word. \u201cThere are worse things than someone who means well.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike someone who knows better,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cBut would rather not.\u201d\n\nHe found himself making boxes in his head and fitting pieces into them: Julian\u2019s laugh, the way he did not always look at you. The way he stood half-turned. The freckles that had escaped a plan. He put these into the box labeled Dangerous, which in his internal taxonomy often overlapped with the box labeled Fine.\n\nAt home the house smelled like lemon cleaner and tomato sauce and a thread of shampoo that had got itself lost downstairs. Elaine stood by the stove, banging a wooden spoon against a jar as if it were a bell in a church no one attended anymore. Rick\u2019s suit jacket hung over the back of a chair, empty of him. The corner of the table had a new chip. Tux walked past them like a rumor and leapt onto the counter. From the living room came the low voice of a newscaster saying a thing that made no impact and then a commercial for a regional jewelry store that had always advertised in this region and always would. Mr. Dwyer, who had a key and a habit of being there, sat on the couch with his legs crossed and a crossword in his lap. He did not look up, but he said, \u201cFour-letter word for your mother\u2019s firstborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d Cornelius said, walking past and feeling, as he always did, that he was stepping into a photograph he had already seen. He put his hand on Elaine\u2019s shoulder. She leaned into it like a plant.\n\n\u201cI meant \u2018Eldest,\u2019\u201d Mr. Dwyer muttered. \u201cNot that it would fit. Whose idea was this grid?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Rick,\u201d Julian called as their father\u2014his father\u2014came down the stairs. They didn\u2019t look alike. Rick had the florid complexion of a person who liked to tell stories into the chest cavity of a beer bottle. He crowded a room. He had a laughter that made you feel praised. He had a habit of making every day into the day before a big game.\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d he said, and his voice filled the kitchen. He kissed Elaine on the mouth, then drew back and wiped his own mouth with a napkin because of the sauce, then gave her a look that said: I know you hate when I do that. \u201cNew lamp came today, Cornelius. We\u2019ll fix that flicker.\u201d\n\nCornelius found himself nodding, as if the flicker were a person he had promised to meet. He had been the unofficial maintenance person in the house since he was seventeen and the sink had first made a noise like someone drinking too loudly. He was twenty-nine now. It was hard to remember a time before the sink had opinions.\n\n\u201cGo wash your hands,\u201d Elaine said. \u201cI learned last week that apparently grease can come out of towels with club soda. Who knew?\u201d\n\nMr. Dwyer raised his pencil. \u201cMy mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got your mother,\u201d Elaine said. \u201cAnd neither do I.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one knows club soda this way,\u201d Mr. Dwyer said, and then he looked at Cornelius for the first time. His eyes did this thing sometimes where they didn\u2019t focus correctly but still expressed warmth. He blinked, slow. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not dinner if you\u2019re not yelling at me for time,\u201d Cornelius said, and Mr. Dwyer\u2019s mouth softened, as if he were pleased to be part of a pattern.\n\nThey ate. They always ate with a formality that surprised people who came to the house for the first time. Elaine lit candles. Even when there was spaghetti. Even when there were just grilled cheese sandwiches. It was her cathedral, the table, and she cleaned the candleholders once a week as if devils lived in wax. Cornelius could tell you which fork was his by feel. Rick told a story about a client who had not known how to say the word \u201cescrow\u201d and would never learn it. Mr. Dwyer complained that his crossword had doubled in difficulty over the last six months; either that or his brain had halved. Julian contributed a remark about a busker on 13th Street whose horse was a unicycle, then got embarrassed, and then leaned over to scoop sauce onto his plate. The unicycle\u2019s horse was all Cornelius could picture now. He saw it in the reflection in the microwave door. He didn\u2019t know if he was present or absent from his life at any given moment. On his good days he could fake it. On his bad days you could see the absence around him like a halo.\n\nElaine said, \u201cCornelius is thinking,\u201d and Mr. Dwyer put his pencil down and said, \u201cThat boy needs a patent.\u201d Rick said, \u201cNo, he needs a vacation,\u201d and Julian said, \u201cNo, he needs a\u2014\u201d then stopped, as if he had reached the end of his sentence as a cliff.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t finish,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cLet me guess later and be wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could be right,\u201d Julian said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the point of guessing?\u201d\n\nCornelius finished eating and washed his plate, because if he didn\u2019t rinse it and stack it the way he liked, the plate would dry sauce in a James Pollock design that would never scrub away without noise. He stacked. He wiped. He let the kitchen light make a hum in his eardrum. He listened for Elaine and Rick arguing in their bedroom\u2014the normal kind, the sort that did not require him to walk to his car at eleven and pretend the radio could save him. No. Tonight, the house was mild-tempered. The lemon cleanser hovered without reproach. Tux sat on the back of the couch and made shapes with her tail like italic letters.\n\nIn his room, Cornelius found a paperback on his pillow. The cover had a cutaway drawing of a house, the inside walls exposed, as if someone had peeled it like an orange. A note sat on top of the book, scribbled in blue ink. Look at Chapter 3. It\u2019s the thing about windows. \u2014J.\nThe J looked like it had been started and then gotten interrupted halfway through. The letter had two attempts at a tail.\n\nHe sat on the edge of the bed. The bed squeaked in a way that made his stomach compress. He pressed his palm into the duvet to make it stop. He opened the book. Chapter 3 had a little rust mark from a paperclip someone had lost, but no paperclip. The first sentence read, Some houses wear faces they found in other neighborhoods. He smiled. He wanted to hold the sentence in both hands the way Julian had held the keys. He closed the book and put it on his nightstand and told himself not to read more. He went to the window and looked out. He could count three porch lights on the street, two from houses that had existed long enough to get nicknames on the walking routes and one from the new unit at the end where the family had a subscription to a produce service and it came on Tuesdays.\n\nHis phone lit. A message from a contact saved as D. Vale. Tomorrow at 10 still good? I have the room with the plant. The plant may or may not be alive. \nHe wrote back: Yes. I\u2019ll bring a plant funeral kit.\nHe meant to write a follow-up, something about the book, something about being uncomfortable that the plant made him think of himself, but he did not. He put the phone on the bed and then fell asleep with his clothes on and woke an hour later very certain he had had a conversation he could not remember. He looked at his phone to make sure he had not texted anyone a confession or a recipe. The phone did not tell on him. He went back to sleep, and when he woke next he had lines from Chapter 3 in his head as if he had eaten them with his pasta.\n\nThe drive to the office on Church Road took fifteen minutes the next morning. It should have taken seven. He counted the lights to time his breathing and then forgot how many there were. He parked behind a building that had once been a house and was now other things. Inside, the hall smelled like carpet and paper. No music. No receptionist, because D. Vale didn\u2019t believe in them. A waiting room that did not want to be one. A plant that did not want to be alive. He pressed his thumb to a crease in the armrest of a chair and it came away with dust in it.\n\n\u201cCornelius,\u201d Dr. Vale said, coming from the back. They held a mug and had a face that suggested they never got enough sleep because they were eavesdropping on the neighbors\u2019 dreams. They had a way of making you feel that your name was someone else\u2019s name and you were using it while the other person was at lunch. He stood. They made a small show of looking at the plant. \u201cYou win. It\u2019s dead. No amount of water changes what is essentially a succulent\u2019s headstone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI forgot the funeral kit,\u201d he said, smiling because he wanted to.\n\n\u201cYou brought yourself. Good enough for my purposes.\u201d\n\nThe room had one window. The window had a blind that worked only when you pressed it exactly in the place where someone had before. He sat in the chair with the notch that fit his shoulder blade. Dr. Vale sat across and threw their leg over their knee and let their shoulders slouch in a way that made him condition his own to respond. He thought of the word \u201csplay,\u201d and then he thought of the word \u201csprawl,\u201d and then he realized he was rearranging the letters to make a new person. He stopped. He did not like to be caught rearranging.\n\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d Dr. Vale asked.\n\n\u201cI counted planes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny crashes?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he said, quietly.\n\n\u201cSorry. My mouth moves before my good judgment. Tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met him at the park,\u201d he said, and when Dr. Vale tilted their head he added, \u201cJulian. Rick\u2019s son.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a paper cup. Smooth and cheap and a little soft.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can work with that metaphor,\u201d they said, and wrote nothing down. He\u2019d never seen them write anything down. He didn\u2019t know if they remembered or if the point was to make a life that did not require notes.\n\n\u201cHe was kind. He asked questions. He didn\u2019t try to win. He had a story about unicycles,\u201d Cornelius said, and heard a small laugh come out of his own throat because the absurdity made a shape in the room that was better than the plant. \u201cHe brought me a book.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like him,\u201d Dr. Vale said, as if they had already been there with him.\n\n\u201cYou like that I like him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like that you like anyone,\u201d they said. \u201cAre you telling him?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout liking?\u201d He felt a needle prick inside. He found himself looking at the window, calculating if someone outside could see his mouth. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout any of it.\u201d\n\nThis was their shorthand. This could mean different things on different days. Today it meant: Are you telling him about why the ends of your sentences sometimes come with static? Are you telling him about the way you lose pieces of your week? Are you telling him about the names you find in your pockets that you don\u2019t recognize in your handwriting? It also meant: Are you telling him you were in love with a person once who never heard you say it?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know enough to tell anything,\u201d he said.\n\nThey nodded. \u201cIs it like the book? Can you read him like bolts?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s heavy enough,\u201d Cornelius said. He pressed his thumb to the chair\u2019s notch. He thought of the \u201csomeone else\u201d in the note on his pillow. Not someone else; that had been in his head. He thought of the way the geese had refused bread. \u201cThere\u2019s a singer. He mentioned a singer in Philly, or a band, and I thought that he\u2026I don\u2019t know. It was nothing. I have thoughts that are just air for a living.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about Mae?\u201d they asked, casually.\n\nHe blinked. The name dropped like a penny into a fountain, made a delicate plop. \u201cMae?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mentioned her last week. The person at the coffee place who knows to put extra sugar in your tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Cornelius said, with the relief of someone who had misplaced their wallet and then found it in their other coat. \u201cShe\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mr. Dwyer?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was doing a crossword on our couch.\u201d He felt, for a second, a tug at the back of his head, as if someone was pulling a string out of his scalp. He pressed his palm flat. \u201cHe asked for a four-letter word for firstborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your father?\u201d\n\nHe made a face. \u201cHe walked into the kitchen and made a mess of the way the light works.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me one small thing that is not about someone else,\u201d they said. It had the air of an assignment. He looked at his hands. He looked at the plant. He looked at the cup in Dr. Vale\u2019s hand and the line their mouth made when they sipped.\n\n\u201cI like that the hill at Laurel Acres is cut wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good hill. It humps and then slopes like it\u2019s tired in the middle. It doesn\u2019t belong here. The rest of the park is so\u2026\u201d He gestured with his hand to indicate something like \u201cmade by a committee,\u201d then laughed softly. \u201cI like that it\u2019s wrong. That makes it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d they said, and their voice did something like turning a light on. \u201cKeep that. Practice liking things that are wrong.\u201d\n\nHe left feeling lighter and then heavy. He wanted to cry. He wanted to eat a bagel. He wanted to find the person whose phone voice had called out for Mae and tell them that everything they wanted was already inside their pockets and they just had the wrong coat on. He drove to the store and let the fluorescent lights smear everything into one substance. He counted screws. He sorted a bin of washers by diameter and found satisfaction there that he could not find in any human face. He took lunch in the back room and found a note in his lunch bag in handwriting that looked a little like his own but too neat, too careful. Good boy. Eat the apple. \u2014M.\nHe looked around the break room. Dina sat at the far table, talking to someone he could not see; her hand moved in the air as if she were swatting a fly. Sonia came in and then came back out, as if she had committed and then uncommitted to something. A man in a neon vest stood by the vending machine and the machine rejected him by blinking every black light at once. Cornelius folded the note and put it in his wallet behind a picture of the hill at Laurel Acres that he\u2019d taken one fall when it had looked particularly convincing.\n\nHe thought, briefly, to text Julian. He thought, I could say: I saw the unicycle horse on the news. He thought, I could say: I read Chapter 3. He thought, I could say: Do you like bagels with salt? He did none of these. He ate the apple. He threw the core away and then took it back out and laid it on a napkin because he couldn\u2019t bear it face down in a circle of lettuce. The day moved like a body in pain that no one knew how to handle.\n\nAfter work he drove down a side street he didn\u2019t know he knew. The houses on that street looked like a row of people holding their breath. A woman on a porch yelled, \u201cMae!\u201d and a cat stood up on its hind legs and put its paw against the screen door and said nothing. He parked and sat in his car and did the thing where you put your forehead to the steering wheel and do not cry and do not cry and then breathe and pretend you did. He went home.\n\nThe book on his pillow had a pink sticky note now that read: Sad windows are a you thing. Discuss. \u2014J.\nHe laughed and then didn\u2019t. He went downstairs and found Julian on the floor with Tux, who had her head tipped back to stare into his eyes. They were having a conversation, clear as any other, and Cornelius had the feeling he was a third person in a room where two had already decided to be friends.\n\n\u201cDo you want to go to a show?\u201d Julian asked without preamble when he walked in. \u201cI mean later. Not tonight. There\u2019s a place in Haddonfield, or Haddon Heights, something with an H, anyway there\u2019s this singer\u2014Rowan? Rowan something. They have this way of making even the stupidest line feel like a truth you can sleep on without back pain.\u201d\n\nCornelius put an apple back in the fruit bowl and then took the apple back out because it had touched the lip of the bowl and he had the idea the apple and the lip did not like each other. \u201cSure,\u201d he said, and it came out like he had rehearsed it. He hadn\u2019t, but his mouth was good at pretending. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to invite me to things because of the upcoming\u2014\u201d He waggled his hands. \u201cFamily.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Julian said, and his face settled into a seriousness that made him look older. \u201cI want to. I\u2019m not good at\u2026you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d Cornelius said.\n\n\u201cI talk too much and then not at all. I disappear at weddings.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood skill,\u201d Cornelius said, and felt his throat loosen. \u201cI disappear at the dentist.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight in the chair?\u201d\n\n\u201cPoof.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re something,\u201d Julian said. \u201cI mean that in a way that\u2019s not an insult.\u201d\n\nThey leaned against opposite sides of the doorway and let the silence gather. Cornelius could hear Elaine upstairs running water, running it twice, the second time longer than was necessary. He could hear the traffic on the street, a staccato. He could hear Mr. Dwyer\u2019s key in the lock, then not, then the sound of it dropping to the porch and a soft curse and then the key in the lock again. He could hear his name spoken in the corner of the room in a voice that had once belonged to his grandmother. He turned his head. The corner was empty but the voice had the shape of dust in it, and he wiped it off with his hand. He did this almost without thinking. He did so many things between thinking.\n\nThat night they went out for ice cream and sat in the car at the edge of the strip mall because it was raining and the tables outside were slick with a thin film that made them look like they had been glazed. Julian talked about a job that might have been offered to him and might not. Cornelius ate his chocolate slowly, letting it melt and then taking it back. A group of teenagers sprinted past and then sprinted back again in a loop like they had been wound by a key. The neon sign in the pizza place next door flickered and held. The rain came down at a slant that made it seem like the sky had started to tilt.\n\n\u201cDo you want to get out of here?\u201d Julian asked, and then clarified, embarrassed, \u201cI mean the parking lot. Not the town. Not your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere would we go.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaurel Acres,\u201d Julian said, and laughed at himself. \u201cWe\u2019re those people now.\u201d\n\nThey went. They sat in the car at the top of the hill and watched the slick citizens of the park move through each other's reflections. The rain made pools in the places the hill sank. In the rearview mirror, Cornelius could see his own face. It looked better there than in the bathroom at home. He decided never to look at his face except in reflective surfaces he couldn\u2019t control.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d Julian said, pointing at a particular tree, its leaves heavy, its trunk dark. \u201cThat\u2019s a good tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand trees,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cI mean, I get them. But I don\u2019t understand when people say one is better than another.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis one knows the right words. Look at it.\u201d Julian leaned forward and his hair stuck to his forehead. He made a small noise of frustration like a kettle just before it whistles. He turned and looked at Cornelius as if someone had told him to find a thing he would miss when he lost it.\n\nThey did not touch. The car was fully human: it made noises in its own body and suffered and grew older with them. Cornelius wanted to put his hand on the back of Julian\u2019s hand, then imagined what that hand would feel like in the hours afterward\u2014how the skin would carry the memory like chalk. He wanted a new alphabet for this thing. He wanted to know what percentage of himself he could spend before he was poor.\n\n\u201cTell me a secret,\u201d Julian said. It was not a dare.\n\n\u201cI put the apple core on a napkin,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is to the trash.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember Tuesday,\u201d Cornelius said, and then, because the car felt like the kind of room you could chat with about your failures, he added, \u201cI went to work. I have moments from it. I know there was a piece of paper in my pocket when I took my jeans off that had a phone number for someone I don\u2019t know and the name \u2018Mae\u2019 written in the top corner and I tore it up because I don\u2019t like what it feels like when you keep a thing that doesn\u2019t know how to be kept.\u201d\n\nJulian looked at him. He was very still. The rain rattled the roof of the car like applause. \u201cI forget, too,\u201d he said, finally. \u201cBut when I forget it\u2019s because I want to. You sound like you forget like the town gets fog.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a movie,\u201d Cornelius said, and he had to say it, had to hurry. \u201cIt\u2019s not dramatic. It\u2019s just like you put down a glass and then you\u2019re sure you didn\u2019t, and then you don\u2019t go looking for it because you\u2019re embarrassed to have lost a glass. It\u2019s like that, over and over. Small kindnesses you don\u2019t do for yourself anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you tell Dr. Vale?\u201d\n\nHe smiled at the windshield. \u201cThey know. They operated on me last year and took out the part of me that remembered Tuesdays.\u201d\n\nJulian did not accept this joke. \u201cDo you\u2026are you scared?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always scared. I think that\u2019s the base note. It\u2019s just that sometimes there\u2019s harmony and I can\u2019t tell where it\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Julian said. And it was a thing to say. It was something to put into the glove compartment and carry around for a while. Cornelius felt the words like a new penny he didn\u2019t want to spend. He put his fingertips on the ridge of the glove compartment for a second, then pulled them away like it was a person\u2019s cheek he should not have touched.\n\n\u201cDo you want to come tomorrow,\u201d Julian said, \u201cto the place with the singer? Rowan? The H towns? We\u2019ll get lost and then unlost and then pretend we meant to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Cornelius said, and it fit.\n\nWhen he went to bed, he found a new note. Coffee before the road? Meet me at the Wawa on 73, 5:30. I\u2019ll be the one with the two coffees and the look of betrayal if you don\u2019t come. \u2014J.\nHe sat on the edge of the bed and held the note and felt too old for this and too young and exactly right at the same time. He put the note under the book. He undressed in the dark, as he did when he didn\u2019t want to see the history his body had written in dabs and scrapes and small computers of pain. He lay down and slept a heavy sleep that was not a sleep but a sink.\n\nHe woke at three to the sound of someone washing dishes in his kitchen and went downstairs and found the sink empty and his hands wet.\n\nHe dried them and went back to bed. He told himself that in the morning he would be rational and put every thing in a bin and label it and see that nothing was moving when he looked away. He put the thought in a box. He labeled it with a piece of tape and wrote in his best, careful handwriting: DO NOT OPEN ALONE.\n\nIn the morning the Wawa parking lot had that washed-out bluish light that turns every car into the same car and every person into a part of your day you haven\u2019t lived yet. He saw Julian\u2019s yellow hoodie like a flag put out for an obscure holiday and felt his chest fill with something like the moment you get on a ride at a county fair and decide to trust the bolts. Julian was holding two coffees. He held one out. Cornelius took it and felt the heat and did not wince. He told himself it was good to hold hot things. It was practice.\n\n\u201cYou came,\u201d Julian said, and it was not relief so much as recognition, as if they\u2019d been planning this meeting all their life and had nearly missed it.\n\n\u201cI would always come,\u201d Cornelius said, and then he wondered why he had said that, as if he had started in a different conversation and brought the end of it here.\n\nBehind them, someone called, \u201cMae?\u201d A voice with a shape he knew. He turned. The parking lot was a shuffle of sneakers and a spill of napkins someone hadn\u2019t caught and the dark mouth of the store and the glint of a trash can lid. He saw no Mae. He saw, for a moment, Mr. Dwyer standing by the door with the crossword folded into an origami bird. He looked again and it was not Mr. Dwyer, it was a teenager in a varsity jacket laughing into his phone.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Julian said, and Cornelius nodded and followed him to the car. He put his coffee in the holder that had a crack in it, a hairline that had been there since the beginning of time. He watched Julian\u2019s hand on the gear shift. He watched the rain start again even though the weather had promised it wouldn\u2019t. He watched the town open itself to them like a book with a fold in one page already.\n\nOn Route 73 they found a rhythm. Julian sped up and slowed down in time with the cars in a way that made Cornelius think of schools of fish. They passed the places Cornelius had gone for paper plates and batteries and the places Elaine had gone for wedding things and the place where a florist had told them it was fine to be late, it was always fine, and the place where Mr. Dwyer had shouted into his phone about grout. They passed a giant billboard advertising accident attorneys. They passed a smaller billboard advertising forgiveness. The river was on their left for a while, and then it disappeared like a friend you thought was following you in line.\n\n\u201cYou ever think about leaving?\u201d Julian asked.\n\n\u201cOnly in the daytime,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cAt night I believe in everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when it\u2019s easiest to be fooled.\u201d\n\n\u201cI live there,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cIt\u2019s home.\u201d\n\nJulian laughed, then rubbed his eye with the heel of his hand. \u201cTell me something the hill told you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt said I don\u2019t have to keep any of this,\u201d Cornelius said, and thought: I don\u2019t know if that was the hill or me pretending to be the hill so I can do the thing I want to do and blame the landscape.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep some of it,\u201d Julian said. \u201cNot all of it. Not a collection. Something that fits in your pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a note,\u201d Cornelius said, and then he did not say anymore because they arrived at a red light and a truck next to them made a noise like a flood and he was afraid that if he spoke he would drown himself. He touched the note in his pocket anyway, like a superstition, like a map.\n\nThe show was in a room that used to be a pizza place; you could smell the ghost of cheese. Rowan stood on a little platform and sang into a mic that had been dropped many times, its grill dented like a knuckle. They sang about people who put their fights in jars and stack them in the attic. They sang about a man who walked into the ocean because he thought it owed him an apology. They sang about a house with a floor that sloped so gently you had to lie down on it to understand what was happening to your body. Cornelius stood close enough to the stage to feel the air moved by Rowan\u2019s voice and far enough that he could pretend none of the words were about him.\n\nJulian swayed. He looked more comfortable with music than with conversation. He closed his eyes. He did not let them stay closed; he checked his corners and then closed them again. Cornelius wanted to memorize that motion and then wanted to forget it so he could be surprised again. He wanted things that were not reasonable to want.\n\nAfterwards, they stepped into the alley to breathe and to get away from a man who had told them at least three times that he had been to LA and found it shallow. The alley smelled like garlic and damp and the hope that a cat would appear and solve your problems. Julian tipped his head back and said, \u201cSee? Back pain free.\u201d\n\nCornelius felt sweat on his neck and the little cool scratch of air when a breeze found him. He said, \u201cThe song about the attic,\u201d and Julian said, \u201cYeah,\u201d and that was enough.\n\nWhen he went to pay for their drinks, the woman at the counter said, \u201cYou\u2019re Cornelius,\u201d as if she were introducing him to someone inside himself. She had a name tag that read MAE and a small scar between her eyebrows that made her look like she spent a lot of time thinking hard about unfixable things.\n\n\u201cI guess,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI like your bolts,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do them well.\u201d\n\nHe stared, then realized she was teasing him, except he could not find the crease of a joke on her mouth. He paid. He left a tip that made no sense for the purchase. He went outside. He said nothing to Julian about it. He put the receipt in his pocket and did not look at it later.\n\nOn the drive home, he fell asleep for one long blink and woke to Julian tapping his arm, gently, not the way Rick would have, and saying, \u201cYou know where we\u2019re going,\u201d and he said, \u201cAlways,\u201d and then they were back with the hill in the dark and the house with the lemon smell and the cat who had made a bed of the stack of clean towels. They put their keys on the table in the front hall. His key made a noise. Julian\u2019s key made a more urgent noise. He looked at the notes on the fridge. One was in Elaine\u2019s handwriting: Eggs? Another was in a blocky print he did not immediately recognize: Cornelius\u2014fix the light in the downstairs bathroom. I keep seeing my head in it and it\u2019s not my head. \u2014D.\nHe stood and felt, for a small pinch of time, that the house was full of people standing in the places where he had ever stood. He felt that if he turned too quickly he would collide with himself. He thought of the hill and what it had told him. He thought of the planes, and how easily they vanished when he looked away.\n\nHe went to bed. He did not turn on the lamp. He lay on his side and listened for whatever it was that would tell him he had done something irreversible. He heard nothing. He slept, and in his sleep he walked down a long hallway with the sound of a soft pencil on paper following him, and when he turned around there was no one there, just his own footprints in the wax, and then even those disappeared as if the floor had changed its mind.",

                              "content": "He woke to a ring of damp on his pillow and the conviction that he had made a promise in his sleep. It lived in his mouth like a coin he\u2019d been holding between his teeth, sour and shiny, unspendable. The house was awake already; it had that mid-morning industry that meant Elaine had taken the day by both sleeves and shaken it. He could hear the vacuum bumping gently into the ottoman, the ottoman offering no apology and no resistance, the vacuum retreating and gathering itself for a second attempt. He lay still long enough to watch the light in the room shift from a flat square to a trapezoid that made a neat shadow of the book on his nightstand, and he thought: sad windows look like this when the day starts misaligned. He reached for the book without looking, opened to the chapter with the paperclip rust mark, and let his eyes snag on a sentence about how glass remembers the people who look into it too often. The sentence had the taste of penny again. He closed the book and put it face-down because he didn't want the room to catch him reading about itself.\n\nOn the refrigerator there were three new notes. One was in Elaine\u2019s round, emphatic hand: Don\u2019t forget Mr. Dwyer\u2019s casserole dish. One was in a thin, precise script he recognized as belonging to the bridal boutique in Marlton where Elaine had put a deposit on a dress that made her look like someone else\u2019s best story: Fitting at 2 p.m., please no lotion. The third was blocky and a little impatient. Cornelius\u2014fix the light in the downstairs bathroom. I keep seeing my head in it and it\u2019s not my head. \u2014D. He held that one between forefinger and thumb and let it lean. He knew the shape of Mr. Dwyer\u2019s D; it was like a front step with a crack in it. He folded the note and put it in his pocket as if that would quiet it and went for the toolbox.\n\nThe downstairs bathroom had the kind of light people mistake for clarity. It was too high, too bright in one quadrant, too dim in the corners. He turned the switch and watched the bulb blink, catch, blink again\u2014a tired eye\u2014then hold. The mirror needed a proper bracket; someone had installed it with a faith in adhesives that bordered on religious. He stood and looked at his head the way you look at an object in a store window you might steal if you weren\u2019t yourself. He saw the slightly wrong tilt of his ears, the hair he had tried and failed to make obey routine, the little nick on his cheek he didn\u2019t remember earning. He tilted his head left. The man in the mirror tilted right, because mirrors are contrary. He lifted his hand and watched his hand rise up on the other side. There was a breath between the two motions, the smallest lag. It might have been in his head. It might have been in the wiring. It might have been the kind of thing some people would call a trick of the light. He leaned closer and thought: who is this, and why is he so committed to my mistakes.\n\nThe screw that held the fixture bent when he tried to coax it; he felt it protest in a whisper that went down his wrist and into his elbow. He took the fixture off anyway because he had the rhythm of removal in his hands; you had to listen for the way the threads wanted to be undone. He saw the wires, one with its cloth fray like a tired sock. He thought of the attic song and the jars. He thought, not for the first time, that the house was a person who had burned their tongue on hot soup very young and never tasted things correctly after that, and he was always trying to describe salt in a way the house could understand. He stripped the end of the wire and retaped it with a neatness that would have pleased Mr. Dwyer if Mr. Dwyer had known to be pleased by the correct application of tape.\n\nWhen he put the fixture back and tested it, the light held; it made the room a little less honest. He looked one more time at the glass. The person there blinked when he did. There was no lag. For a second, relief made him silly, and he said out loud, \u201cYou\u2019re me,\u201d and the mirror did not argue, because no one sensible does when the point is to get through a morning. On his way out he saw Tux in the hallway, consulting the patch of sun as if it had asked to be seen. She tilted her face to him and then back to the light like someone comparing two opinions she didn\u2019t trust.\n\nElaine was at the table, wedding magazines like shallow boats all around her. She had a pencil tucked behind her ear and her hair was up in a knot that had trapped a sensation from three days ago and wouldn\u2019t let it out. \u201cYou fixed it,\u201d she said, and he handed her Mr. Dwyer\u2019s note as proof of request rather than achievement. \u201cHe\u2019ll stop the melodrama now. He keeps telling me that light has a grudge.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d Cornelius said. He put his finger on an image of a cake that had three tiers and a habit of leaning toward the person who didn\u2019t want it. \u201cThis one looks edible.\u201d\n\n\u201cCakes are for photographs,\u201d Elaine said, and then laughed because she knew it sounded like sacrilege. \u201cThank you. And please tell me you are coming to the fitting, because if I have to listen to Rick say the words \u2018meringue bodice\u2019 while I\u2019m in a dressing room, I will forget my own name and never get it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d he said, and he meant it in the way you mean you\u2019ll show up at a place where someone loves you beyond your usefulness. He made a note on the dry-erase board by the back door in his own careful hand, Fitting 2 p.m., then added underneath in small letters, Bring patience, bring water, bring a joke for emergencies.\n\nJulian arrived like a soft wind; the side door knew him now and opened without the alarm complaining. He carried two paper bags and the disappointed mouth of a person whose coffee had not been strong enough but who knew not to blame the coffee. His hair was damp from a shower or from rain; he shook his head once like a dog, saw the magazines, and smiled into them with affection and a little alarm. \u201cI come bearing breakfast,\u201d he said, and then, \u201cI know it\u2019s not breakfast time, but my body is on its own schedule. I have no union representation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s onion bagels in there,\u201d Elaine said, peering into the bag as if it might be a small theater. \u201cBless you and all of your employers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to introduce a new motion,\u201d Julian said. \u201cLet us as a family consider the possibility of approval for the cardigan with elbow patches for Rick. It will give him something to do with all that enthusiasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has four elbows,\u201d Elaine murmured, tearing a bagel with a competence that made Cornelius think of weather maps. \u201cFind the cardigan that allows for that, and I will approve it.\u201d\n\nCornelius had the pleasure of watching the two of them orbit each other with practiced care. The word family pricked him; there was a sense, always, that he had entered a room where a conversation had begun ten years ago and he had to catch up by asking one compelling question. He took an onion bagel and made it a sandwich with tomato and salt he did not apologize for. Julian leaned in the doorway and said, \u201cThe singer posted the set list, by the way. They never do that. It made me feel falsely in the know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe song about the jars,\u201d Cornelius said. It came back to him, not the words, not the melody, but the sensation of jars breathing thinly as if they had been held under too long. \u201cDid you ever put anything in a jar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI once tried to put my bad temper in a jar,\u201d Julian said. \u201cI labeled it \u2018June\u2019 because it was worse in summer. I left it in a drawer and when I opened the drawer in February I found it had evaporated, but only from that jar. It had moved into all the other jars that were trying to be olives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it works,\u201d Elaine said. She looked between them as if she were a teacher in a class where the lesson plan was feelings but the worksheet was wedding seating arrangements. \u201cCornelius, I need you at the fitting to tell me when my face is lying. Julian, I need you later to help me convince Rick that white shirts come in whisper and not just in yell.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d Julian said, sketching a salute that made Tux look skeptical. \u201cI will arrive with a selection of whispers.\u201d\n\nThey went to the fitting and the boutique smelled like steamed fabric and an expensive complaint. While Elaine disappeared behind a curtain with a woman named Rhea who had scissors around her neck like a medical warning, Rick made little speeches to no one and everyone. Mr. Dwyer sat on a tiny couch with his legs crossed and his crossword tilt to his mouth and asked Cornelius if he thought \u201ckind\u201d could be a synonym for \u201csort,\u201d then answered himself and noted that all words were cousins if you met them at a family reunion. Cornelius nodded and let himself be proud when he found himself saying, \u201cSometimes they hate each other for how alike they are.\u201d\n\nIn the mirror opposite the little couch there was a reflection of the curtain. The curtain moved as if someone else was back there too or as if the boutique had a draft that was superior to other drafts. Every now and then he saw not the shape of the version of his mother that belonged to his ninth birthday party or his high school graduation, but a person he did not recognize who wore her bones. He decided it was the lighting. He decided it was the curtain. He decided it was the part of his brain that liked to write poems under the word \u201crisk.\u201d He kept deciding things until Elaine stepped out and the language of the room changed and there was nothing left to do but witness.\n\nShe did not look like someone else\u2019s best story. She looked like herself, which was a story. She looked like the person who had held his shirt in the dryer on the morning of picture day and told it, Be kind. She looked like the person who had once put a sprig of mint in a glass and made him feel like they were rich. He breathed out. He did not need to say anything because his face had the thing she wanted in it and she saw it. Rick said something about officiants as if the officiant were the weather. Mr. Dwyer stood up without realizing it and then sat back down as if standing had been an impulsive marriage proposal. Julian put his knuckles in his mouth for a second and then took them out and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll need stronger shoes,\u201d and Elaine said, \u201cOh, I know,\u201d and they laughed like the only two people on a bench.\n\nAfterward they went for coffee because Elaine believed in balancing luxury with ritual. The coffee place had the warmth of a place where the milk steamer once had a personality and then went to college. The woman behind the counter had a name tag that read MAE and a sweater with a hole in the shoulder that had been repaired with yarn of the wrong color. She took their order without writing anything down and said, \u201cCornelius,\u201d with the tone of someone who is reminding you of a debt and a birthday simultaneously. He did his best not to flinch, because you could not live in this town and flinch at your name; it would wear you to a nub. He was about to say something neutral and ordinary when she added, \u201cYou left your change last time,\u201d and handed him a quarter with a smear on its face that looked like the continent that would always show up first when he tried to make pancakes of states.\n\nHe turned the quarter over. He had not bought anything here the last time; he had never been here in this particular room, not since they moved it from its old location on the corner by the laundromat with the missing O in its sign. He looked up at her and she smiled. It was a good smile if you liked not being able to tell exactly what the person wanted you to do next. He put the quarter in his pocket with Mr. Dwyer\u2019s note as if the two might have things to say to each other in the dark. Julian was watching him with that patient interest he had when he wanted to be a witness but not a detective. Elaine was talking to the barista about the bouquet in a photograph behind the register and whether it had been heavy.\n\nBy the time they got home, Rick had to change and go to a meeting about a meeting. He left in the way he always left, with a promise he would be back soon and a confusion about which set of keys he needed for his car, because his keys were essentially a small orchestra and each had an ego. Mr. Dwyer stayed long enough to retrieve his casserole dish and to say that the light in the bathroom felt like it had forgiven him. He left a new note on the fridge without telling anyone, which Cornelius found later: If this house were a person, I\u2019d tell her to stop sighing when she sits down. \u2014D. He put his palm on the fridge door and felt it hum its own reasons.\n\nHe went upstairs with the book and decided to read Chapter 3 through, properly, without skipping or charming himself with single lines. The author wrote as if they had an ear pressed to a certain artery of the county and could tell you which way the blood was going and which corners had trouble and where a building\u2019s ankle would give if you pushed. Some houses wear faces they found in other neighborhoods, the first sentence said again, and this time he imagined their house with a borrowed expression the way you hold a friend\u2019s phone and it makes your hand look strange. There was a section about windows that had given up: not broken, not even cracked, but resigned. When a window goes tired, the author said, it admits a different sort of weather. He thought of the downstairs bathroom. He thought of the mirror knowing someone who needed it more. He thought of his bedroom window, the trapezoid morning, and the way he had placed the book face-down to save the room from knowing too much about itself.\n\nJulian knocked and then didn\u2019t wait because that is what you do when you decide the person is less likely to say yes if you make them pronounce it. \u201cWe should go to the hill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt smells like rain but they haven\u2019t told it it\u2019s raining yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always want to go the second before a thing starts,\u201d Cornelius said, and he said it fondly because the fondness felt like the little handle on a drawer you don\u2019t always open. He put the book down and stood and felt every place his socks held his feet. \u201cAll right.\u201d\n\nThe hill had elected to be magnanimous about the weather. It had made puddles in advance, as if this were now part of its service. The planes were out but not many; they looked preoccupied, as if they had just come from a fight two towns over and were telling themselves a story in order to land. The grass had a slick it wore like a nervous bowtie. They found their usual slice of ground and sat in the way they were learning to sit together\u2014adjacent, at an angle that allowed for an exit and pretended it didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a word for the thing when you think you see somebody you know in a crowd,\u201d Julian said. \u201cNot d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Not that. The other thing. It\u2019s about faces and how the mind cheats.\u201d\n\n\u201cApophenia,\u201d Cornelius said, and then immediately doubted himself because the word came up wearing a coat that might have belonged to something else. \u201cOr that might be patterns. It might be the wrong coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw Mr. Dwyer outside the Wawa last night,\u201d Julian said. \u201cExcept it wasn\u2019t him. I was going to go over and remind him not to hang wet towels on the rack he put in, but then the man turned into someone the age I am when he turned his head.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did that too,\u201d Cornelius said, because the trick of sharing is not to weigh it down. \u201cI saw him in a jacket,\u201d and he gestured, which was the same as saying, You\u2019re not alone in the mis-seeing. \u201cMae was at the coffee place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one with the unicycle horse guy in line sometimes,\u201d Julian said, and this was how they spoke: as if the nouns had agreed among themselves to be part of a set. He looked at the sky and it looked back like a person who thinks you are about to say something and isn\u2019t sure they want to hear it. \u201cWe could look for her.\u201d\n\nCornelius made a face and then smoothed it down. \u201cI don\u2019t know who she is, in the proper nouns way,\u201d he said. \u201cShe keeps being the corner of rooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike the cat,\u201d Julian said, and Tux would have appreciated that if she had been there to see herself analogized.\n\nThey didn\u2019t find Mae on the hill; they found a man with a broken kite and a father with a dot of ketchup on his cheek and a teenage girl sitting on the ground like she had been told, conclusively, that she was the problem and was practicing her counterargument in the grass. They watched a woman run past with such concentration that the air around her seemed to have been organized by appointment. They watched a flight of geese correct themselves the way a sentence gets corrected on a second pass. They did not talk much. The sound of a train arrived as a rumor and then became an event behind the trees. When the first drop of rain hit his wrist, Cornelius looked at it like a receipt he was not sure he needed to keep.\n\nAt home there was a new voice in the vents. He knew because it said his name the way his ninth-grade math teacher had said it when the question of whether he had the right number of parentheses had become a moral issue. He stood in the hallway and listened to the vent as if it were an uncle. He did not call for anyone because experience had taught him that inviting witnesses made the magic go home and sometimes he preferred to watch it stand unashamed in his kitchen and then leave of its own volition. The voice said, \u201cCorn,\u201d which was what his room said, and then it said, \u201cDone,\u201d very distinctly, and he had the dark, distantly funny sense of someone ticking a box.\n\nHe went upstairs and checked each window by putting his forehead briefly against the glass as if it were a person with a fever. The glass had the same temperature as his thoughts, which was no help. In his nightstand there was a scrap of paper he did not remember putting there. It had the neat version of his handwriting on it and read: Tuesday groceries: screws (brass), green beans, bread, forgetfulness. Eat apple. \u2014M. He sat on his bed with the scrap and let it sit in his lap like a small polite animal. He thought of the apple core on the napkin, the mercy he had shown a piece of trash, and felt something complicated move under his sternum like a suitcase going down a flight of stairs very quietly.\n\nWhen he showed the note to Dr. Vale the next day, they held it with two fingers as if it were evidence and a tissue. \u201cYou wrote this,\u201d they said, not as a question but as an observation left on his coffee table for later. \u201cBut you also found it. How does that feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike there are two of me,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of them is late. One leaves me fruit.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like the one who leaves fruit,\u201d they said, and it was as soothing as being told you liked something you already knew you liked. \u201cM.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who that is when it isn\u2019t me,\u201d he said. \u201cMae is real. She has a sweater with a hole. She knows my name. But then the notes. And then Mr. Dwyer\u2019s note about the head that isn\u2019t his head. And the bathroom light being a person who uses the wrong pronouns for us on purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d they said. They had their leg thrown over their knee and their sock was a color that made him think of pediatric waiting rooms. \u201cWhat happens if M is just a part of you that had to sign himself because you needed the signature.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be relieving,\u201d he said. He pressed his thumb into the chair notch that belonged to him. \u201cIt would be relieving to be an ordinary split.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if M isn\u2019t,\u201d they said, not invested in the answer and entirely invested in watching him find it.\n\n\u201cThen I don\u2019t want to know yet,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes the knowing gets there before the wanting is ready to be a place.\u201d\n\n\u201cPractice that sentence,\u201d they murmured, simply pleased by it. \u201cKeep your windows halfway. You can let the weather in without being responsible for the thunder.\u201d\n\nWhen he left their office the plant in the waiting room had been replaced with not a plant but a photograph of a plant. It sat in the same pot, printed in glossy, as if someone had told it to hold its pose for longer than plants are built to pose. A new sticky note on the frame said: Succulent in memoriam. Please refrain from watering. \u2014D.V. He smiled and then stopped smiling and put his fingers behind his back as if water might leap from them without his consent.\n\nHe drove to work and the store hummed and the bolts weighed wrong and he took pleasure in being able to tell. He rearranged a display of hammers so their heads looked a little less like threats. He made a small ceremony of shaking the rug in the entry, because the rug had a habit of trapping gravel that made all the carts complain. At lunch there was another note in his bag in the neat handwriting. The bag had a sandwich he did not remember making and a cookie he would have chosen if he had been the person who had made it. Good. Practice letting someone like you. \u2014M. He folded the note and put it with the others and then took it out again and read it once more as if it were going to change while he watched. He thought about showing it to Julian and then did not because he did not know how to explain the generosity without also explaining the fear that came with it, and fear makes everything tacky if you\u2019re not careful.\n\nAt night he and Julian lay on the living room floor with Tux between them like a referee who believed in none of them. They were not touching but they were in the same dimension. The television was on but muted; a man in a suit said important things with his eyebrows and no one felt threatened. The window in the living room had one blind slat that had started to warp; it made the light from the street into a little wave across the ceiling. \u201cI keep thinking about the song with the floor that sloped,\u201d Julian said. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst kind of slow catastrophe, where you want to believe the whole time that you are deciding to lie down.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe house we rented when I was seven had a floor like that,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cIf you put your pencil down on the desk it would roll and you could learn what you had done wrong by whether the pencil came back. I had a teacher who put tape under one leg of each chair to make things pretend to be right. It worked like makeup. It didn\u2019t work like gospel.\u201d\n\nJulian turned his head and looked at him the way you look at an animal in your yard you want to invite in but you\u2019ve watched enough nature shows to know about wildness. \u201cWe can get the floor in this room leveled,\u201d he said. \u201cRick would approve of a project he can talk about at parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cI think I like the slant. It makes you very aware of what you want. You have to decide to sit.\u201d\n\n\u201cPractice deciding,\u201d Julian said. \u201cPractice liking the wrong hill.\u201d He reached out and let his fingers touch the carpet an inch from Cornelius\u2019s hand as if demonstrating a concept. \u201cPractice letting someone like you,\u201d he added, and then looked at the ceiling too quickly, as if the confession had been a moth.\n\nCornelius breathed. He could feel the seam in the carpet with the tip of his finger. It was like the line between two days, and how you do not know when one becomes the other until you go to wash your face and realize the mirror is tired of showing you the old one. The house made a sound in its bones like a yes. From the kitchen came the sister sound of plates settling. From somewhere under the floor, or over it, or in the vent that ran past the hall where the half-room said his name, he heard the small, unimportant sound of someone putting a glass down carefully so it would not startle anyone, and then he heard nothing, which lately was his favorite sound in the world.\n\nHe woke in the middle of the next night to a smell of citrus. It was not the lemon cleaner; it was an orange that had been cut open in another room. He went downstairs and found half an orange on the counter with its own absence of bite marks, the way a fruit looks when it has been performed at rather than eaten. There was a napkin tucked under it with a single word written in the neat hand: Later. He stood with his hand on the counter and the counter\u2019s cool pushing against the meat of his palm and thought about what it means to be told to wait by a thing you want. The refrigerator hummed as if in sympathy. The clock on the stove said a nonsense time and then corrected itself, and then said the nonsense time again, as if it were practicing its panic.\n\nThe next day at work he caught sight of a woman in the aisle with the flashlights whose hair was the color of tea you make for someone you love and then forget to bring them. He had the certain uncertain sense of having known that hair before. She turned and her face arranged itself into someone who had stood behind him once in a line that moved like a train in fog. She looked at him with real curiosity and then at the flashlights as if they could help, and he did what he could: he found the batteries that would last longer than anyone promised and showed her how to open the little plastic hinge without swearing. When she left she said, \u201cThank you, Cornelius,\u201d and he wanted to ask for her name so that he could put it somewhere and see if it left a note for him later, but he let the moment leave with a proper posture.\n\nThere were two new sticky notes on his pillow when he got home. One was from Julian, unsigned except for the way the J tailed off twice and then the tail decided to be its own letter in a separate alphabet: The window on the stairs looks like it wants to say something. If you catch it, tell it I\u2019m listening. The other was from M, or from himself pretending to be M, or from the part of him that had decided that giving himself permission required paperwork: You don\u2019t have to hold the hot thing long enough to prove you can. Just touch and tell. \u2014M. He lay on his bed and held both notes and had the disconcerting feeling that he had missed the point once by holding a thing too long. He put the notes under the book because the book liked to keep company.\n\nThe show in Haddonfield had loosened a small knot in him he had tied himself when he was twenty and believed if he did not tighten it, the world would accelerate without warning and fling him. He went with Julian to the grocery store and did not leave when the fluorescent light decided to be a personality, because Julian was there and because he had the note in his pocket that said Later and it had to choose a later and this was one. He picked a bag of green beans for no reason and then put it back because the green beans had been picked out of the bag by other hands and he didn\u2019t like the public intimacy of that. He bought milk and bread and a lemon. He bought a pack of screws because he couldn\u2019t not when he saw them poorly placed. He carried the bag to the car and felt like he had balanced something he could not name.\n\nAt the house, the stairs window had condensed on the interior, little half-circles of moisture like sentences in a language he had not agreed to learn. He touched the glass with the back of his hand, just a grazing, and it pulsed under his skin the way music does when you stand too close to a subwoofer at a party you did not want to attend. He did not know what it wanted to say. He did know that the house had a way of telling him things once and then leaving it to him to remember, and lately remembering felt like trying to catch a moth without hurting it. He went downstairs and found Julian on the couch with Tux draped over his lap like a garment. \u201cIt\u2019s saying you should clean it,\u201d Julian said, without looking up. \u201cIt\u2019s a practical poet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the vinegar,\u201d Cornelius said. He said it in a voice that made the glass and the cat and the man on the couch into something you could call joyful without feeling like you had lied.\n\nHe cleaned the window and the vinegar smell made him think of nights his mother had spent in kitchens that weren\u2019t theirs, making them smell like home by force. He watched the way the cloth moved across the glass, the way the streaks agreed to organize themselves under the pressure of a hand. He talked to the window, quietly, the way you talk to a thing you want to reassure. He told it that they were making decisions, that they were not always good at it and sometimes they counted planes instead of houses, but they would get there, or here, wherever here was. He waited for the word that would come through from the other side, the way voices sometimes came through, and when none did he accepted the quiet as the answer. He could do that. He could learn to accept quiet and call it a sentence.\n\nLater, in the kitchen with a towel over his shoulder like an apology, he cut the orange in halves again and put the quarters on a plate. He wrote M on a napkin and put the napkin under the plate and felt a ridiculous sense of theater that did not embarrass him, which was growth. He left the plate on the table and went to bed and woke in the night to the sound of someone finding the plate in the dark without knocking anything else over, and the next morning the napkin was gone. He waited for fear. It didn\u2019t come. He found, instead, a note on the back of a receipt for onions that did not match anything they had bought. The note said: Good. Braver than yesterday. Let that count. \u2014M. He put the receipt with its onion price in his wallet behind the photograph of the hill and felt himself add the number for bravery to some ledger he hadn\u2019t realized he had been keeping since he was the age when you first understand that wishing doesn\u2019t make your parents love each other more but you keep doing it because you\u2019re superstitious about despair.\n\nThey went to the hill again, because that was what they did now when the day felt like a room with too many people in it. The planes obliged them with their obedience. The geese pretended to be governors. The grass pretended to be something it wasn\u2019t and did a convincing job. They sat and counted, because counting is a kind of spell. Julian talked about a job interview he had postponed, about the way he was practicing answers in the mirror without wanting to stare into anyone\u2019s head that wasn\u2019t his. Cornelius talked about bolts and the way the weight had shifted since the new supplier, about the possibility of telling his manager in a way that didn\u2019t sound like an accusation. He could feel the box in his head he had labeled DO NOT OPEN ALONE; he could feel that something in it had changed shape, and he understood suddenly that what you put into a box doesn\u2019t stop moving just because you shut the lid. He leaned back on his elbows and let the unimportant pain in his wrists tell him he was alive.\n\n\u201cTell me the truth,\u201d Julian said, his voice the kind you use when you want to invite a person to step onto a piece of ice with you. \u201cDid the hill tell you anything today.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt told me not to collect people the way I collect screws,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cIt told me to keep only what fits in my pocket and doesn\u2019t cut the lining. It told me to learn the difference between heavy and good.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mae,\u201d Julian said, not because he wanted to know but because the pattern demanded the name.\n\n\u201cShe was at the coffee place,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cShe gave me a quarter I didn\u2019t deserve.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople do that,\u201d Julian said. \u201cThey give you change for a bill you haven\u2019t handed them yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you ever think we\u2019re all versions of the same person in different lights,\u201d Cornelius asked, and the question left his mouth before he could give it a belt and shoes and a haircut. \u201cLike the way a house wears faces from other neighborhoods. Maybe we\u2019re just neighborhoods wearing each other\u2019s faces until we forget to give them back.\u201d\n\nJulian looked at him like a joke that had landed and then found it was a bird. \u201cIf that\u2019s true,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I hope I get your eyebrows. They\u2019re decisive. They know what they want without being cruel about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can borrow,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cBut I want them back by Thursday.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Julian said, and he held out his hand in a theater of handshakes that neither of them went to because sometimes the metaphor was enough, and sometimes touching was a thing you saved like a small currency.\n\nThat night the house breathed differently. Rick came home with a speech and no audience and gave it anyway to the cat, who looked unimpressed and warmed. Elaine put the magazines away as if performing a ritual for a god of paper and then sat at the table and hummed without memory of ever humming. Mr. Dwyer called to ask if the light was behaving and left a message in which he apologized to no one for doubting his own eyes. The downstairs bathroom light held. The mirror did its job and only its job. The note on the fridge that said If this house were a person had acquired a line under it, underlined by no one like an agreement. Cornelius stood at the bottom of the stairs with his hand on the banister which had been worn by three other families and knew the exact weight of their rings, and he let the house have its say, and he had his, which was to go to bed with the book open to the rusted paperclip mark and to dream of a window that opened not onto the yard but onto a room where someone who signed his name with a neat hand was sitting with a cup of tea and a pencil and a willingness to wait.",

The second thing he did was reach for a pen he kept in the drawer with socks that had given up on being pairs. He sat cross-legged on the bed with his hair doing the thing that made him look like he had been listening to static too closely, and he wrote on the back of a grocery list for a week that was not this one. He wrote, Hello, which felt formal and unnecessary, and then he wrote, If you are me, thank you for the apple and the nerve. If you are not me, please leave the sink alone when I am sleeping. Underneath that, he added, What do you want. He folded the paper into a small, square politeness and slid it under his pillow the way people in stories hide teeth for fairies. He did not expect anything; it is easiest to wait when you have removed expectation from the room like a bucket you keep tripping over.\n\nDownstairs the day had put on a dry shirt and decided to be responsible. Julian sat at the table with a bowl of cereal that had given up being crisp, reading a job listing on his phone and making a face like the job had told a joke he was not in on. Elaine slid toast into the toaster with more ceremony than the action required and was telling the butter, out loud, to remember it was butter and not a soap. Tux had her paws on the chair rung, the picture of practice. \u201cThere\u2019s a flea market on Saturday,\u201d Julian said without looking up. \u201cColumbus. They have a guy who sells old doorknobs like they\u2019re records. I thought you might want to\u2026you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always want a thing that used to be a thing,\u201d Cornelius said, and he said it in a voice that told Julian he\u2019d already said yes. He poured tea and put sugar in it in the increments that made doctors sigh and wait for a better moment to bring it up. The idea of the flea market arrived in his head with the smell of soft pretzels and wet cardboard and the particular sadness of a bin of remotes whose televisions had gone on without them. He saw, in advance, a table with little drawers, one missing a pull, and the careful handwriting of a person who had labeled each drawer \u201cAssorted.\u201d\n\nElaine said she\u2019d make coffee for them to take and then forgot she had promised and then remembered at the exact moment she opened the fridge for something else, and she laughed at herself and made the coffee with great seriousness. \u201cYou boys need hats,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when it is pretending not to be summer, the parking lot is a pan.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad says hats ruin a man\u2019s hairline,\u201d Julian said, deadpan, and Elaine rolled her eyes to a place where her mother would have been waiting with a spoon to say that hairline ruin started in the womb with unpreparedness. It was a house built of small lines like that, and if you kept them in your pockets you always had something to give back to a person who expected nothing and was delighted by the thought of change.\n\nThey left on Saturday before the town had fully decided which errands it would commit to. The Wawa lot was a composition in gray, and then there was Julian\u2019s hoodie like a declaration, and then there was the coffee and the way Cornelius liked to hold heat briefly and then let it go to prove nothing to anyone. The highway gathered them up and put them down in a field arranged into lanes by vendors who believed in their own ability to create order out of old toys and kitchen implements. The sky had a flatness to it that suited rummaging. The men who shouted at you to come see a miracle were selling knives or tape or the idea that if a thing cuts through a shoe, it must therefore be good.\n\nWhat he liked best about the market was the ache of specificity. You could turn your head and find a collection of snow globes that had come from one woman\u2019s life and each had been shaken when a certain song came on in a certain December. You could find a crate of old house numbers, each one a way of saying Here we are to a stranger who had meant to go next door. He walked past a table with a tangle of chargers and watched a man in a neon cap pick one up as if it might forgive him his sins. He watched a child pick up a cracked crystal doorknob and declare it a gemstone and then be corrected by a parent who liked truth like a hobby. He stopped at a spread of brass hinges and felt the heft of them in his palm the way you hold a history and see if it intends to keep talking.\n\nThe woman behind the table with the doorknobs and sash weights had hair the color of tea you forget and then sip anyway. Her sweater had a hole mended with a darker yarn that made the hole honest instead of repaired. When she looked up at him, she made a small sound of recognition that was softer than a \u201cHi\u201d and more specific. Her name tag read MAE in the tidy capitals of someone who had considered lowercase and declined. She lifted a sash weight as if she were showing him the heart of someone who had been a good house.\n\n\u201cThese were made when gravity had a code of ethics,\u201d she said. \u201cFeel that.\u201d\n\nHe did, and it was the kind of heavy that tells you it intends to be loyal. The weight sat in his hand like a long single thought. \u201cThey put velvet in shoes now to make them feel like this,\u201d he said, and Mae smiled as if the sentence reminded her of someone she had been fond of in a life with more socks in it.\n\n\u201cYou carry yourself like someone who has learned to tell the difference,\u201d she said. \u201cBetween heavy and bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am practicing,\u201d he said, and the table made the polite sound of a surface that would prefer you not put your coffee down on it. Julian circled and found a metal tin with a picture of a ship on it and said, \u201cThis would make a good place for secrets,\u201d and then realized he had said it out loud and colored as if he had shared a baby photo.\n\n\u201cI keep quarters from nowhere,\u201d Mae said. \u201cI put them in a medicine bottle and pretend I\u2019ve cured something. Some days I spend them and it\u2019s like telling a joke to a cashier and you both know it\u2019s not very good but you are saving the day anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Cornelius,\u201d he said, because the rhythm demanded the equation of strangers, and her eyebrows did a small, delighted lift at being given the name she already had known. \u201cYou gave me a quarter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI returned it,\u201d she said, and her tone held that fine edge between tease and insistence. \u201cDebt is a door, not a weight. Don\u2019t carry it, use it.\u201d\n\nHe bought a sash weight not because he knew what he would do with it but because it made the heaviest sense. He bought a handful of glass knobs, none of them matched, to make a future drawer happier. Mae wrapped them in the brown paper you can only find at markets like this, paper that used to be part of a person\u2019s map. She handed him the bag and then, like a friend passing a note under a desk, tucked a small folded thing into his palm. He did not look because he understood the religion of delayed revelation. He thanked her. He did not tell her that sometimes his apartment keys made a noise at the same time as voices in vents. She probably already knew in the way people like Mae know what kind of light has a grudge.\n\nThey walked. Julian carried the tin and the weight as if he were demonstrating a metaphor to a class that might not deserve it. He talked about the job again, and this time there were specifics; there would be a man named Reggie who had worked there forever and liked to pronounce acronyms as if they were his grandchildren, and a woman named Shaila who had once trained to be a florist and now maintained the database like a bouquet she was determined would not wilt. Cornelius listened and said the right encouraging things without making them into a spell. He bought a bag of kettle corn that turned his fingers into a small grease festival. He considered a set of chisels because they were honest and sharp and then left them because the day was already holding many corners.\n\nBack at the car he opened the note from Mae. It was not his handwriting, but it had a family resemblance, the way cousins stand in the same way when they\u2019re thinking. The paper had been torn from a book of receipts; the back had onions listed at a price that felt aspirational. The note read, Do not be so good at leaving yourself breadcrumbs that you forget you can stay in the wood. \u2014M. He put it in his wallet with the others and felt, as always, the small compression of fear followed immediately by the relief of having something to hold that wasn\u2019t a worry. He did not show Julian. He wanted to, but the note had hands of its own and wanted to be held by one person at a time.\n\nWhen they got home, Rick was rearranging the hall closet like a man practicing for a TED Talk about the misuse of space. He had a shoebox full of batteries he\u2019d bought in bulk because he liked any word that promised abundance. He said, \u201cLook at this, can you believe how they wasted the top shelf,\u201d and Elaine said, without looking up from a list of song choices the DJ had sent, \u201cIt\u2019s where I keep the winter.\u201d Mr. Dwyer arrived with a bag of oranges like a punchline and said a thing about scurvy that made Tux leave the room out of principle. The ordinary accumulation of a day took courage to stand inside of, and Cornelius felt heroic just moving his shoes out of the doorway and not hitting anyone with the sash weight when it knocked his shin through no fault of its own.\n\nHe carried the weight upstairs and put it in the corner of his room as if that corner had been cheating on gravity and needed to be reminded of its responsibilities. The book on the floor looked up at him without apology. He touched the pillow and felt the note beneath it like a thought. He left it. The experiment was to wait. He could do that. He could practice not jostling the universe and calling it patience.\n\nAt dinner, Elaine asked if anyone had strong feelings about aisle runners. Rick advocated for something that looked like the jersey of a team he had invented and loved. Mr. Dwyer advocated for clean shoes. Julian advocated for walking like you meant it, which made Elaine kiss him on the head in the manner of a person appreciating a sentence and its speaker equally. Cornelius advocated for the absence of petals, because petals on floors look like regret if the lighting is wrong. They ate salad that had fallen into its bowl very willingly and a dish with chickpeas that had changed their name at least three times on their way to being served. The candles were lit because it was a day. The house gathered itself into the cool of evening and did its little shiftings and small operas. The downstairs bathroom light held without blinking and someone said aloud the sort of \u201cthank you\u201d you send into the part of the world that doesn\u2019t require thank-yous to continue.\n\nHe slept the thinly satisfied sleep of a person who has not cried but has thought about it and considers that a kind of participation. He woke at three the way he does. The pillow had a new weight. He turned on his side and retrieved the note underneath like a magician pulling a ribbon out of his own mouth. The same neat hand had written, I want to be allowed to want without being the only one who wants. Leave the door on the chain sometimes. I can reach through. \u2014M. He read it twice and then once more to make sure the letters weren\u2019t moving when he looked away. He put the note with the others, then did a thing he had not thought he would do: he wrote back on the back of a dry cleaning receipt from a suit he had worn once to a graduation that had not entirely belonged to him. He wrote, The chain is on. Try me. He slid it into the gap between the door and its frame where the chain lives, and he went back to bed. He did not sleep. He lay and felt his heart perform planning meetings.\n\nIn the morning, the receipt was gone. In its place was nothing at all, which was either rude or the point. The chain sat with its own pride. He made tea and did not tell the tea what it needed to be this time. He told Julian instead that he had found a thing for their future drawer, and he told Elaine that the sash weight would make a good argument against certain drafts, and he told Rick that the batteries had best not be near the stove because the house did not like combative objects huddling. He told no one about the note and its disappearance and the way his name had started to sound in his head like the last light of evening on the kitchen table when everyone gets up but the table remains, gathering the day as if it had been invited.\n\nHe kept his appointment with Dr. Vale because those were the kinds of appointments you keep if you want to build anything that doesn\u2019t fall over when the washing machine thinks too hard about suds. The waiting room had the photograph of a plant in the old plant\u2019s pot, and a new photograph of a plant that had presumably died elsewhere, as if to keep the first one company, as if the room were a small gallery of failures that had decided to be art. He touched neither frame out of respect for what you are not meant to correct. Dr. Vale wore a sweater that made him think of schools and halls with waxed floors. Their hair did what hair does when its owner has stopped trying to influence it and has moved on to other ambitions.\n\nHe told them about the market and the weight and Mae\u2019s note about woods and crumbs. He told them about the chain. He did not tell them about the half-grief that followed the word \u201cTry me\u201d being taken seriously by a person who might be him and might not. Dr. Vale listened the way good translators listen when the speaker believes they are speaking the only true language. \u201cBoundaries,\u201d they said, not as an order but as a diagnosis for something that had survived. \u201cYou did that without writing \u2018No trespass\u2019 on your forehead. How does it feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like I put a sign on a window and the window didn\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI expected to be punished for deciding anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the notes,\u201d they said. \u201cDo you want less of them.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the fake plant pretending to do its job without chlorophyll. He looked at the actual M note folded perfectly in his pocket, making its little right angles of insistence. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI want permission to want them without labeling it a symptom.\u201d\n\nDr. Vale did the smile they do when they have recognized a good use of their own vocabulary in the wild. \u201cYou can ask for that. Start with yourself. Then try your kitchen. It\u2019s often more forgiving than your head.\u201d\n\nThey talked about Julian then, and how it was easier to be kind in a moving car. They talked about the wedding and how a public ritual can make private quiet easier to place in the house without apologizing to the furniture. They did not talk about fear like a monster under the bed; they talked about fear like a small dog that barks because the world makes doors slam. When he left, the photograph of the plant looked relieved that he had not tried to water it with his worry.\n\nOn the day of Julian\u2019s interview, the house put its hand on the small of his back in the gentle pressure of everything going well if you pretend the going is optional. Julian wore a shirt that had decided to be brave and a jacket that thought it could make him look like he could afford to hear no and keep breathing easily. He stood in the doorway and made the motion of leaving three times, then stopped and looked at Cornelius and said, \u201cTell me a thing I can put in my pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour hands smell like oranges,\u201d Cornelius said, and then quickly added, \u201cIn that good way when you open a peel and it makes the room remember that winter ends. You can take that. It\u2019s a fact. It is not dependent on their mood.\u201d\n\nJulian nodded the way you nod to a doctor who is recommending a treatment that has fewer side effects than panic. He took a breath that made his ribs remember they had been made for something besides protecting frightened things. Cornelius reached for a scrap of paper and wrote, quietly self-mocking, QC-MAN APPROVES, then drew a little tape measure with a cape. He folded it and handed it over. Julian tucked it into his wallet as if it were a photograph of childhood that needed a new home.\n\nThe hour after Julian left was an hour made of slow objects. The clock on the stove huffed. Tux stared at a spot on the wall until the wall apologized and offered to be more interesting next time. Elaine went to look at flowers alone because sometimes she needed to practice making decisions that no one protested, and also because she liked the smell of green in the cold compartments where flowers wait. Rick called twice, once to ask if the red tie made him look like a judge of something and once to ask where he had put his lucky pen that was just a pen that had once signed a thing that had not later been regretted. Mr. Dwyer knocked and then remembered he had a key and then knocked again and got his own timing wrong. He walked in and stood in the kitchen and said, \u201cWhat is the word for when the house is saying something only you can hear and you will seem unwell if you ask someone else if they hear it too.\u201d\n\n\u201cTuesday,\u201d Cornelius said, and Mr. Dwyer made the face of a person who had been offered a cookie you weren\u2019t sure you had earned.\n\nThey drank tea and Mr. Dwyer told a story about a co-worker who had taken up beekeeping and now had opinions about the quiet of rooms he used not to care about. The notes on the fridge had tried to be helpful and had ended up sounding like the menu of a very specific restaurant. There was one from Elaine: Bring pins. There was one in Julian\u2019s hand, quick and leaning: If I die in a lobby, tell them I loved the fish. There was one from M, because of course there was; Cornelius found it tucked behind a magnet shaped like a corn cob that someone\u2019s aunt had considered whimsical. It said, You asked. I want to stand in the room with you when you decide and not press my thumb on the scale. \u2014M.\n\nHe took the note upstairs and sat on his bed and folded and unfolded it until it resembled an idea that had been lived in. He put it under the book\u2019s cover, between Chapter 3 and the chapter about stairs that forget which step is the last and love to trick you. He touched the chain on the door without looking at it and was surprised to find it warm. He realized he had fallen in love with how he began trusting things and was not yet ready to tell the things about it.\n\nJulian came home with the air of someone who had been asked to judge a parade of hats and told he wore his own head well. He stood in the doorway and did a small dance that was entirely in the elbows and said, \u201cI was not terrible,\u201d and then let himself lean against the wall in exactly the way he did when his body did not know yet where to put a relief. He took his wallet out of his pocket and opened it to the little cape and said, \u201cHe was there,\u201d and Cornelius said, \u201cHe has very strong opinions about adhesive labels,\u201d and then they stood in the kitchen and allowed themselves to be pleased without saying a single sentence about deserving it.\n\nThe wedding date scooted closer in the friendly, aggressive way dates have in the middle of the calendar. Elaine tried on shoes that cost like a choice and walked in them in the hall with the determination of a woman being honest about pain. Rick practiced a speech in the mirror that began with a joke about how he had once thought marriage was like joining a bowling league and then realized he had to learn his partner\u2019s release and footwork and temperament and have a good cry in the parking lot when the pins knocked themselves down in his heart. Mr. Dwyer made a list of people to sit near people who would make them less awful. Cornelius took his sash weight downstairs and hung it temporarily in the hall to explain to Rick the concept; Rick pretended to understand and then later said to Julian, \u201cWhat is it,\u201d and Julian said, \u201cA very nice rock,\u201d and Rick felt satisfied.\n\nThe house began to make a new sound at night, not a yes and not a no, a longer word he could not hear all of. It began, the sound, near the vent, and moved along the seams of walls as if looking for the right place to end its sentence. He woke at two and lay with his palms flat against the sheets to see if the quiet was in his hands or the room. He heard the half-room say his name in its slow syllable and then, much later, he heard it say, Wait, as if you were saying it to a dog you intended to treat. He said, \u201cAll right,\u201d out loud, so the house would not feel it had to be theatrical to get his attention.\n\nHe saw Mae twice more before he decided that choosing not to ask a person if they know you is a kind of ethics and maybe also a kind of fear. Once she was in the store for batteries and once she was standing at the end of the aisle that held gutter hooks for lights, considering the physics of cheer. Both times she greeted him with his name as if he had volunteered it, and both times she left without buying the thing that had called her into the place; some people step into rooms to make sure they still exist, and then they go. The second time, as she turned, he caught sight of a scar on her wrist in the exact place where his watch had once raised a rash, and he had the thought that human bodies conspire across distances to make the same mistakes for the same reasons and then meet in aisles to prove it. He put his hand to the screws because that was his scripture.\n\nOne afternoon, Rick came home with a carton of eggs that turned out all to be brown, which Elaine preferred because the brown ones looked more like eggs had looked in her childhood when chickens had been closer to them; he made a triumphal noise as if he had returned with treasure from the city. He put the carton in the fridge and something in the way he closed the door reminded the fridge of a story, because later when Cornelius went to get a lemon, he found a sticky note on the inside of the door that read, You do not need permission to be here. This is not a store. \u2014M. The note had been stuck behind the butter. It had gotten cold on its way to him. He warmed it in his hands and thought for an unworthy second about turning the note into a refrigerator magnet, and then he told himself you didn\u2019t turn permission into a product.\n\nThat night, Julian and Cornelius lay on the living room floor again because the carpet had ideas about therapy and the ceiling had accepted its role as confessional. Tux took up residence on the couch back in the way of cats who want to watch without committing to any one person\u2019s gravity. They watched a movie without the sound and improved it with their own voices, and at some point, because sometimes you do touch a person in your life even if you have sworn not to for a month to see who you are without that, Julian\u2019s hand drifted and landed on the back of Cornelius\u2019s wrist. It was a touch like specification. It was not long. It was not romantic in the way songs make paints peel. It was exactly enough to make the nervous system say, I see. He did not jerk away or laugh. He did not narrate it. He did not later mention it when he wrote a note to himself in his head about how he wanted to go very slowly because he did not trust the part of him that liked to sprint toward people and throw his wallet and his personality at their lawn.\n\nOn a wet morning when the planes had decided to take the long, careful route, he met Dr. Vale at a diner that had survived three separate renovations and had the kind of walls you could forgive for their complaints. They had not planned to meet; he had texted and they had said, \u201cI am near eggs,\u201d and he had said, \u201cI approve,\u201d and then he had gone. They sat in a booth with a rip that had been mended with tape in the same way some people apologize too loudly and you are embarrassed on the behalf of your own discomfort. He told them about the chain and the kitchen and the note on the butter, and they told him about a dream they had had about finishing shoes in which everyone wore their plan on their feet and the hard part was agreeing to go the same amount of distance as the person you loved.\n\n\u201cCollecting,\u201d they said, stirring coffee with the concentration of someone trying to make a point perform. \u201cYou collect screws because they are useful, and because they are alike enough to comfort you and different enough to keep you from feeling stuck in Mormon wallpaper. You collect notes because you are teaching yourself a way to be told. Let yourself have. Then ask yourself which things have souls that want to be held and which things want a drawer and a label and to be ignored until they are needed. There is no moral superiority in being needed.\u201d\n\nHe played with the sugar packet and did not rip it, because ripping is a choice some mornings and not a release. He thought about a box he had in his head and about the label on it he had written in his careful, school handwriting when he was so young he could still smell paste as a fact. He considered the idea that boxes could have windows and chains and you could be the guard and the guest. He did not say any of this; he told them instead that he had bought a sash weight because gravity needed reminding, and they nodded as if he had brought them flowers.\n\nThe day of the final fitting arrived like a guest who you feared would be early and was instead exactly on time. Elaine\u2019s dress hung on the door and made the light in the room do what light does when fabric invites it to behave. The boutique had unlocked a patience for them that had been hidden behind plastic garment bags. Rhea the seamstress had her small sticks of chalk lined up like a family. \u201cShoes,\u201d Rhea said, and Elaine produced them with the glee of a person committing to a conspiracy their feet might regret. There was a small, predictable chaos. There were people in small chairs pretending they were not crying at a person standing in front of a mirror trying to balance the story of herself with the cost of hemline. There was a bouquet being gently scolded by a friend for its lack of structural integrity. Rick did his best to be both there and not there, which is a man\u2019s greatest test in rooms where lace is deciding everyone\u2019s posture. Julian was good at handing the right pins and not stepping on the train and finding the humor that did not soil the moment. Cornelius stood and watched the way the mirror arranged the room and the way the room let the mirror lie a little for their benefit, and he felt nothing dramatic; he felt a plain true thing in his chest like he had put down a heavy bag finally and remembered he had hands.\n\nHe went outside for air and found Mae on the bench by the tree that had selected itself in Julian\u2019s taxonomy as a good tree. She had a paper bag of pretzels and offered him one exactly the way a friend would in a lunchroom you had accidentally walked into twice. He took it and did not make a thing of the salt stuck to his lip. She said, \u201cI like the window in there. It tells the truth about what light does to a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good window,\u201d he said. He thought about asking her if she had left the note on the butter, and then thought about the violence of trying to force a person to match a ghost with your own handwriting. He let the thought wave and go. \u201cYou come to weddings,\u201d he said, a sentence that was not an accusation and sounded like one to ears trained to hear the world as trouble. \u201cI mean, to places where people pick what to wear in case it rains and doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like fabric stores,\u201d she said. \u201cI like rooms where people collaborate on a future and say \u2018Let me think,\u2019 and you can watch them do it. I like alterations. I like the noise of pins in a dish. And I went to buy thread,\u201d she added, producing two spools the exact color of sky an hour after the day ends from a pocket in her sweater that had been mended and remended until it had the texture of a decision you had to make ten times before it stuck. \u201cYou looked like a person who would need someone to hand them something if they put their hands in their pockets too long.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, because that was the word you say when a person has bought thread and memory without reminding you of the price. \u201cDo you know that the plants at my doctor\u2019s office have become photographs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew they would,\u201d she said, with the confidence of someone who has seen many things decide to be images. \u201cIt is a mercy for both parties. The plant was not fit for the daily rain of certain kinds of sentences. The photograph can take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you leave notes on people\u2019s butter,\u201d he asked, finally, and she laughed, a sound like a lens cap popping.\n\n\u201cI am not your mother,\u201d she said, not unkindly. \u201cI am not your angel. I am not your memory with neat borders. I am a person with a sweater that does not give up. I am a person who knows you know how to fix a light without bullying it, and I like that. That is all.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. He could feel the place in his chest where disappointment had tried to prepare a bed. He did not lie down in it. He went back inside and became, again, a person inside a particular day, and that is a job that deserves to be listed when people ask, What do you do.\n\nThe night before the wedding there was chicken that had been roasted in a pan older than any of them. There was a salad in a bowl the color of a friendly argument. There were napkins folded with the kind of care that becomes a joke later and then an heirloom. There was a silence after they ate that was not uncomfortable. Rick put his hands on the table and felt the way a different life would have made him a person who drummed on surfaces when he needed attention, and he declined that life in favor of this one, where he could say, \u201cLet me tell you about a day I didn\u2019t know anything and it was fine,\u201d and be believed. Elaine sat in her chair and looked at the men she would call her men and thought about shoes and sorrow and how you arrange them so both behave. Mr. Dwyer washed the chicken pan with tenderness and a minimum of self-congratulation. The light in the downstairs bathroom held. The vent said nothing or said everything and he had stopped needing to decide which it was.\n\nHe went to bed and put his hand on the book and thought about the chain and the door and how there is a sweetness in being able to hear a person\u2019s hand on the other side, not knocking, just being. He woke in the night to no smell at all, which was unusual and a gift. He lay and listened to the house do its breathing, the same as his mother had done in the room down the hall, the same as he had done as a child when he swore he could hear his own blood move and had named it a train to make it less lonely. In the morning, there was a single note in the kitchen stuck to the salt cellar with a magnet shaped like the state of Delaware. It read, Keep your windows at half-mast today. There will be weather. I trust you. \u2014M. He laughed a little in his throat because he had expected a list; the note had offered him a sentence and a vote.\n\nThe wedding day was a series of small competitions. The weather tried to be both and instead landed on gentleness with a show-off cloud. The vows tried to be original in a town where people had been promising and failing and promising again since sidewalks were chalk. Elaine tried not to cry and then cried anyway and forgave herself with the efficiency of a woman who does not have time to be embarrassed. Rick tried to keep the speech under seven minutes and went to nine, but only one person looked at a watch and that person was Mr. Dwyer because he was timing the moment to tell a story that needed a precise entry point. The photograph that would end up on a mantle had three versions: the one where Cornelius looked like he had accepted something, the one where Julian looked like he had been told a good joke and had tucked it under his tongue to keep, and the one where Tux, who had been smuggled into one group shot as a dare, looked like she owned the house and its social calendar.\n\nThere was dancing. Cornelius did his small version of dancing, which is to say he let the music move the area from his elbows to his shoulders and did not attempt anything below the knee that might have suggested he had ideas. Julian did the kind of dancing you do when you have spent enough time in rooms where people forget they have bodies and then remember with relief. He came back to the table flushed and urgent, put a bottle of water down that had been opened by three different cousins in their zeal to help, and said, \u201cI think I got the job,\u201d and Cornelius said, \u201cWater first,\u201d which is how he knew he had started to practice loving a person without making them a project.\n\nThe woman who had given them coffee in H-town and said his name had a line at the bar and did not look their way; if he had waved she would have seen him, but the evening had its own logic. Mae stood by the door once, watching, and then left like someone who had a train to catch, whether there was a train or not. Dr. Vale sent a text that read, Do not talk to anyone doing a bit at a reception, which made him laugh and then put his phone away because the phone had no business being at a wedding except to turn into a camera with no future for a second and then leave them alone.\n\nWhen it was over, when the rice had been replaced by bubbles because someone had read an article, when the candles had been blown with a sigh by a cousin who had questions about fate, when the cake had been less delicious than everyone hoped and better than most cakes, when the shoes had done their work and stumbled off to be forgiven, when the house received them back with its gratefully uncluttered hallway, when Tux yawned at them like a curator closing a museum, when the light in the downstairs bathroom held again because that is who it had decided to be, he went upstairs and took the chain from the door and put it back and took it again and then left it on. He wrote a note that said, Door is on the chain. I am not locking you out; I am inviting you to reach, and he did not sign it, because the point of a signature is sometimes to remind yourself of a name and sometimes to accept that other people remember it for you. He slept and dreamed of bolts that weighed exactly what they should, and woke ready to check if the planes were honest.\n\nIn the days after, the house developed a new habit of placing little objects where he could not quite remember leaving them but had to admit he might have: a washer on the edge of the kitchen sink, a ribbon in the bathroom drawer, a button as dark as a joke on the windowsill. He collected them in a small ceramic bowl shaped like a leaf someone had made in a class with a single kiln, because it seemed polite to provide a landing. He wrote no new letters to M and still received one or two, less directive, more companion. One said, You are allowed to be patient without making it an accomplishment. One said, Good. Keep loving the wrong hill; it knows your name. He kept them without feeling like a museum. He told Julian, finally, about the notes; he did it in the car because he trusted that the trees would spin past and eat any excess melodrama. Julian listened and did not ask for proof and did not make a joke and did not make a chart; he put his hand on the gearshift and said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and then a minute later said, \u201cOkay,\u201d again, and that was the exact blessing he had wanted without knowing how to ask for it.\n\nThey went back to Laurel Acres and counted in silence, and when he missed a plane, when the bead went missing and did not return to its strand, he felt the old tug and then, like a muscle he had been building without seeing it, he felt the new ease arrive to help. He breathed and did not call it an achievement. He turned his face to the not-quite-right hill and leaned back on his elbows and watched a family try to eat sandwiches on a blanket that had decided it would rather be a cape. The geese gathered anyway in parentheses and scolded the bread for not being allowed. The town moved around them in its jughandle logic. The air smelled like lemon and tomato and the inside of a Wawa and the paper they wrap thread in when they love you a little. He did not practice leaving. He practiced staying, which is the heavier thing and, when done correctly, the good one.",

It tipped its chin at the lawn and the lawn lay down in apology. The hill at Laurel Acres bleached, all the little greens deciding to agree to be one color to make the sky feel less alone. Inside the house, doors swelled as if remembering some old irritation they\u2019d had with being rectangles. Elaine kept the windows at half-mast as if obeying a maritime ritual, which in its own way she was; the house had its flags and she had learned their meanings. The chain on Cornelius\u2019s door began to feel like jewelry on a person who doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re fancy enough to wear it. He touched it in the mornings, making sure the metal remembered how to be a boundary without being punitive. The sash weight in the corner did honest work, reminding the room what down meant. He moved slower, which felt like a luxury and a surrender, and also like something Dr. Vale would call a practice if he brought it to them with a bow.\n\nJulian started the job the way you start a book you were assigned in school and then realize you would have read anyway. He came home with stories about Reggie who had opinions about the right way to eat a hoagie and would fight you with his napkin if you said \u201csub,\u201d and about Shaila who organized the flow of information with the ferocity of a headmistress that children adore in secret. The database, he said, had been a neglected garden with labels that had given up; he liked weeding, it turned out. He brought home a stress ball the shape of a house given out by some vendor and they took turns squeezing it until it developed the resigned expression of a person who has agreed to be a metaphor. In the mornings they met in the Wawa lot with the sleep still standing behind their ears and traded coffees like keys. On good days, the light was the color of a fresh towel and the planes were already up and practicing. On bad days, the parking lot had the personality of an old bruise and they practiced anyway.\n\nThe house conspired to need them. There was a leak in the upstairs bathroom that began as a tiny dark petal in the ceiling over the hallway, the kind of petal you think is a shadow until you look away and come back and it has a border. Cornelius stood under it with his arms crossed because sometimes your posture is part of your toolkit. He remembered the main shutoff because Mr. Dwyer had taught him with the seriousness of a man who had once thought he could fix grief with an adjustable wrench and had found, to his surprise, that water responds better than sorrow does. He went to the basement and found, on the wooden shelf where they kept the things no one can bear to throw away, a folded note. The paper was a torn corner of a paint sample card, the color labeled CLOUD QUILT. The neat handwriting said, Turn the water off at the main while you still want to. \u2014M. It did not sting him, which was either the heat or maturity. He called up to Julian and said, \u201cTrip to the shutoff,\u201d and Julian said, \u201cAye aye,\u201d because he believed in ritual even when the ritual involved an old valve and a disagreement with a pipe.\n\nThey saved the ceiling from becoming a map of a country at war with rivers. The plumber came and affirmed things in a tone that suggested he liked being the authority only because water did not talk back to him in human voices. He praised Cornelius for turning the water off \u201cbefore the event,\u201d which made Cornelius think of weather and the way it is always happening even when you are ignoring it out of self-care. He did not show the plumber the note. He did not show anyone the note. He put it in his wallet because dissenting from help is a weakness he was trying to starvingly feed until it lost interest.\n\nMr. Dwyer took the leak as a personal insult and, therefore, an opportunity. He came over with a ladder that had a dent like a memory of a small mistake, and he insisted on climbing it though Elaine made noises like the understudy to a Greek chorus. \u201cI have been up a ladder since Nixon,\u201d he announced. \u201cI know gravity better than she knows me.\u201d He used a patch compound like frosting and then measured the spot with his eye as if it owed him symmetry as back rent. When they were done, he sat at the kitchen table and drank water like medicine and said, \u201cThere is a word for the feeling of looking at a ceiling and knowing it is lying. My grandmother had it, but it was in Polish,\u201d and then he stared into his glass and waited to see if the word would migrate to English to spare him effort. It did not.\n\nOn a Saturday when the heat pretended to be a necessary personality trait, Mae convinced him to go to the library for a repair caf\u00e9, which is what you call it when people bring their broken toasters and chairs and tougher things and sit in a room full of other people\u2019s skills. The library\u2019s meeting room had that bright institutional sadness that makes certain kinds of hope look more serious. There were card tables with sewing machines and card tables with screwdrivers and card tables with glue guns that had given up on knowing what glue prefers. Mae stood behind a table with screws organized by heads and sizes, and a tray of washers that looked like a coin collection for a country that had refused to be minted properly. \u201cGive me a hinge and I\u2019ll give you a rumor,\u201d she said. \u201cBring me a latch and I\u2019ll tell you who it was guarding.\u201d He took a chair that had a lilt in one leg and showed it that you could be honest with wood and not be a bully. He liked watching hands solve things. He liked watching faces relax into usefulness.\n\n\u201cCornelius,\u201d Mae said in the middle of the afternoon, as if she were calling his name to take attendance in a class he had enrolled in by accident. She handed him a small tin with a ship on it. Inside were three antique screws, one with threads that had barely survived their century. Underneath them was a folded paper that had once been a receipt for exactly twelve onions. The neat handwriting said, You are not an emergency. You can leave a thing broken until it tells you it\u2019s ready to return to being a thing. \u2014M. He looked at Mae and she lifted one eyebrow in a movement so small it might have been a stretch. He put the note with his others. He gave the chair back to the lady whose husband stood behind her with a posture that admitted to being the cause, and he let himself feel the enormity of small salvations in a room with fliers about summer reading crinkling with humidity.\n\nDr. Vale had replaced the photograph of the plant with a living cactus the exact green of a traffic light that is never for you. \u201cA client insisted,\u201d they said when he cocked his head. \u201cThey told me I needed a thing that knew how to mind its own water. I agreed. I can only hope it will respect the acoustics.\u201d They wore a linen shirt that had surrendered after the first hour of the day and had settled into honesty. He brought them the notes and they did not pretend to be anything but delighted by the font of his life. \u201cThe chain is doing its job,\u201d they said. \u201cIt is letting you perform the very human act of both wanting and pausing. Pausing is not refusal; it is courtship. With yourself, yes, but also with anyone who thinks they know you before the second paragraph.\u201d\n\nHe told them about Julian\u2019s job and how the apartment in his head where pride lived had suddenly installed proper lighting. He told them about the repair caf\u00e9 and the woman with a toaster that had stopped trying because someone had asked it to make bread into a personality. He did not tell them about the ache that lived next to his best feelings like a polite roommate, always brewing tea a little too loudly in the morning. They asked him to notice where in his body he felt it when he believed he was not an emergency. He noticed it in his wrists. He noticed it in his ankles. He noticed that he stopped clenching his teeth when he remembered that pausing is not the same as losing your place.\n\nElaine, post-wedding, needed a project that wasn\u2019t called \u201cpost-wedding.\u201d She tried on the mantle of Relaxed Person and found it hung strange on her shoulders. She cleaned the candleholders until they could have passed the viewing-yourself-in-them test at any department store. She washed curtains. She considered a wall she had always considered paintable and then said, \u201cNo,\u201d aloud in a decisive soprano. It was Rick, for once, who suggested they start a supper thing. \u201cPeople bring food,\u201d he said. \u201cWe light the candles, which is your church.\u201d Elaine called it Thursday and refused to give it a name, because names lead to responsibilities and she was experimenting with a week that didn\u2019t scold her. On the first Thursday, six people came, and another one came because they had heard laughter when they walked their dog. Mr. Dwyer brought a salad with fennel and the confidence of a man who believes in his knife. Julian made a pasta that turned out better because he stopped talking to it. Cornelius made beans with lemon and garlic and called it a dinner as if the name conferred adequacy. When they sat down, Elaine said, \u201cGrief sits at this table. That\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll feed it, too.\u201d No one argued. The house recorded the evening in the scrapings of forks like a musician taking notes at a concert.\n\nThe planes changed their routes for a week. Somebody somewhere decided the sky needed a haircut. They no longer came in a tidy blackout-drill line from the northeast but sidled in from the west as if embarrassed by their own angles. It ruined counting for a day and then made it better, because counting is not about correctness if you are honest; it is about believing you can distinguish one thing from another and then forgiving yourself when you cannot. Cornelius sat on the wrong hill with Julian and discovered that he could say, \u201cMissed,\u201d without feeling that the sky had done it to punish him. He could say, \u201cThere are more beads than I can see,\u201d and mean it as an invitation instead of an apology.\n\nRick left for a few days to see his father, whose lungs had decided to declare independence. He packed with the theater of a man who never packs but did not overdo it, which is its own victory. He hugged Julian in the doorway with an awkwardness that made them both newly dear to the house. He squeezed Cornelius\u2019s shoulder with a punctuation that did not require decoding. He called from a hospital room with his voice hovering between public and private volume, and Elaine answered with her table voice asked to do hospital duty. The house went quiet in the way a mouth goes quiet when someone reads it a poem. Tux slept in the doorway of the downstairs bathroom with her paws tucked under as if she were holding her own patience. The light held.\n\nOn a wet afternoon when steam rose from the street like the town thinking, he sat at the kitchen table alone and put all the notes in a line. They made a line the way flight paths make lines if you draw them long enough. This is me, he thought, with the private comedy he trusted because it did not aim for applause. This is me when I was generous with myself. This is me when I was trying to leave breadcrumbs so good I would pretend to be obligated to follow them. He wrote on a clean index card, because all systems require at least one clean page, I hear you. I am practicing without you for a week. This is not punishment. This is posture. He put the card under the sugar bowl which had always thought it was important anyway. He left it there. He drank his tea unsweet for a day and discovered it was not a moral achievement; it was a taste.\n\nThe first night without notes he could feel where the air had been impressed by their absence. He checked his pockets before bed and found only lint and a penny that had seen war. He put his lip to the chain as if he could hear more with the mouth. He slept. He woke and found no paper under his pillow, no napkin under the fruit, no small writing with its neat right angles. He went downstairs and made toast the way a person does when they try to keep their mind from narrating. He checked the fridge. There was only butter and a small civilization of leftovers and a magnet in the shape of Delaware doing its duty. He felt relief without a witness and decided it counted.\n\nHe saw Mae in the store, aisle seven, where people come to argue with shower rods. She put a shower caddy in her basket and then took it out and then put it back as if practicing choices. \u201cThe notes stop,\u201d she said, not asking and not asserting, and he marveled again at the way some people talk like they are in on a secret you don\u2019t remember telling. He nodded. She looked pleased for him the way a person looks pleased about another person\u2019s haircut even when they know the person will hate it for three days and then grow into their skull. \u201cYou will not miss your own handwriting,\u201d she said. \u201cThat happens later.\u201d She put the caddy back and left with a pack of hooks and a small bit of string. He could have asked her, then, but he had already decided to respect the week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the chain rattled. It was not loud; it was the sound you make with your throat when you consider speaking. He was in his room folding laundry in that precise way that makes shirts forget they are fabric and become a problem to solve. He turned. Tux was in the hall, sitting like a person waiting for an apology. The chain trembled and then lay still. He walked to the door and put his hand against it the way you press your palm to glass at zoos and then hate yourself a little for doing it. He said, \u201cI am here,\u201d because he was. The door said nothing. He opened it and found the hallway unchanged, the carpet doing its unheroic job, the small gouge near the baseboard where someone had once moved a table too optimistically to the left. He closed the door and the chain fell back into place with the comfortable sound of a thing choosing its old job over a new ambition. He put the clean shirts away and let his chest keep discussing it while he ignored them.\n\nOn Friday, he did an unforgivable thing. He forgot a bolt. He lifted a small package in aisle ten and believed by the weight that it was fine. He took it to the shelf where it belonged because the old map in his head still listed what belongs where, and three steps later, a feeling like being called by a teacher who had noticed you\u2019d been standing without a reason turned him back. He weighed it again, and it was wrong. Not wrong like grief; wrong like math. He replaced it in the correct place and said, out loud and to himself, \u201cIt happens,\u201d and in that moment the week of no notes turned into a habit instead of a dare. He put his hands on the edge of the shelf the way he puts his hands on the table at home, and he did not shoo his heart away when it tried to jump up and prove how helpful it could be.\n\nOn Saturday, the sky broke. It used rain like a proof. They drove to the hill anyway because it had become the choreography of their friendship. They sat in the car with the windows fogging in symmetrical ovals like thought bubbles you could never be brave enough to write in. The park filled with people who don\u2019t mind water and ducks who did and geese who have elected not to participate in anyone else\u2019s narrative. Julian reached over without ceremony and adjusted the vent so it would blow on both their hands, and their fingers nearly touched and nearly didn\u2019t. The nose of the car filled with the fleeting smell of something electrical that had not quite committed to failing. \u201cI dreamed last night we were counting trains,\u201d Julian said. \u201cThey came upside down and nobody minded.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dreamed your database got tired of being a bouquet and wanted to be a tree,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cIt grew dates like fruit. We had to decide if picking them was murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery Catholic of you,\u201d Julian said, startling a laugh out of both of them. He pressed his thumb against the dashboard as if somewhere under there was a button marked Better Weather. \u201cI like the week you gave yourself. I was worried you\u2019d turn it into a creed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can make a creed out of anything,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cThis week I did not. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\nThey went home and someone had left a pie on their front step in a box with a ribbon like an apology in advance. The note on top had been written by a neighbor who calls everyone by their whole name; it said, Congratulations on being the kind of house where mail does not lie. The pie was blueberry, which made Julian make a small delighted noise in a register that belonged to cartoons. They ate it with forks directly from the tin because some Saturdays require the vote of the house and the house had voted for this. Elaine found them and said, \u201cI see you have become pirates,\u201d and took a fork and joined them without lying about wanting a plate. When they were three-quarters done, Cornelius folded the top crust over like a duvet and said, \u201cOne more piece,\u201d and then did not take it. The luxury of not finishing a thing felt like being trusted with a small relative.\n\nOn the last day of the week, there was a note. It was not in the kitchen or under his pillow or behind the butter which, in summer, had become a person. It was on the stairs window, taped gently with that blue painter\u2019s tape that has never harmed anyone. The handwriting was still neat and still his. It said, Thank you. I did not vanish when you did not call me. You can have me and also have you. \u2014M. He put his nail under the corner of the tape and then lowered his hand because leaving a thing up when you do not absolutely need to take it down is a skill. He leaned his forehead against the glass. The window gave him back the heat of the day softened by evening and whatever you call the temperature of a thought when it has just become less punishing.\n\nHe could have told Dr. Vale. He could have told Mae. He could have told Julian the way he had told him about the previous notes, in the car, with the trees obliging their need for a moving confessional. He did not, not immediately. He went instead to the store and held a handful of washers and let them clink into each other like a tiny polite applause. He took the sash weight down into the hall because the air downstairs had taken to shifting when no one turned the fan on, and he wanted to remind the house of consequences gently. He stood at the base of the stairs and thought about the door with the chain and the day with the pie and the way he had said, \u201cIt happens,\u201d in the aisle. He stood there until Tux came and sat on his foot, and then he stood another minute because he liked the weight.\n\nAt night they lay in the living room again because it had become a position their bodies knew without instruction. The ceiling did its striping trick with the streetlight the way a grandmother does the same card trick every holiday and it is still good. The television showed them a movie where people regret things in airport bars. They turned the sound off at the part where someone said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d because they did. Julian said, \u201cI keep thinking about the way your house sounds like it\u2019s about to tell a a joke,\u201d and Cornelius said, \u201cSometimes it does. Sometimes it only wants to hear if I can laugh.\u201d There was quiet. It was not a test. It was a room where two people had decided to be and were being, with a cat on the back of the couch who would never approve but would always admit to preferring this to a version of the night in which no one was where she could observe them.\n\nThe next day, the planes came back to their old line the way a person returns to the route they had known was shorter all along. He and Julian sat on the wrong hill and did the right thing. They counted. They missed. They counted again. Behind them a father told his child an elaborate lie about geese being secret employees of the park whose job was quality control, and Cornelius admired the impulse and the vocabulary and the wrongness. In his pocket, a folded square of blue tape had adhered to the lining as if asking to be taken along in case of sudden note emergencies. He did not write. He did not forbid writing. He watched the small silver wedges announce their intention without asking to be named. He pressed his hand into the grass and felt the old carpet feel of it, cool and matted by other choices. He allowed himself, then, a specific thought that would have embarrassed him a year earlier: there would be more beads. There would be days when he counted them wrong and liked the counting anyway. There would be a chain and a door and a note that said nothing and still spoke. There would be, and he could stay for it.",

The clouds stacked over the highway like furniture you promised you could carry alone. Late afternoon had that sepia bruise you remember from a childhood afternoon when someone told you thunder was angels bowling and you resented the trivialization of noise. The weather app lied in its precise way and then took it back with an update as if admitting it never really meant it. By the time Cornelius left the store, the parking lot had become a reflective surface for other people\u2019s lives and his own, and the men who sell roofing out of vans were blessing themselves with tarps.\n\nAt home, the house drew itself small. Elaine went room to room closing windows to the exact half she had been advised to keep them, because ritual offers traction. Rick called twice to say he could see the storm from the expressway as if clouds would behave better if spoken to sternly on speakerphone. Tux took up her position on the fourth stair, the one that had learned to translate vibrations into gossip. Julian came in with the smell of damp denim and the particular brightness you get when you have walked fast through fat drops without bending your head, and they did that thing where they narrated the weather to each other as if the sky craved commentary.\n\nWhen the power went out, it was the kind of silence that reveals a dozen other noises. The refrigerator\u2019s secrecy became obvious by its lack; the aquarium at the neighbor\u2019s that no one in the house had ever seen but everyone had heard stopped doing its endless river impersonation; the little clock on the microwave forgot its numbers with relief. Somewhere down the block a child cheered as if a goal had been scored. The rain repositioned itself as the main character.\n\nElaine lit candles because Thursday was over but the table did not know it. Her lighter clicked the way doubts do when they attempt competence. The house accepted the flicker with a grace that suggested it remembered when light was twitchier. \u201cNo opening the fridge,\u201d she said, and then opened the fridge to check on the pie and apologized to it with a hand on the door as if to a startled animal. Rick, stranded in Cherry Hill with weather as his alibi, texted an emoji that looked grimly optimistic and then a paragraph about generators that sounded like a warm-hearted threat.\n\nThey gathered in the living room because it had the most breathable dark. Outside, the sky cracked open, not the clean line of a break but a rip as if something too large insisted on squeezing through. The streetlight did its own small martyrdom and then nothing. The house exhaled the lemon cleaner smell it had been hoarding in the baseboards since morning and, beneath that, the ordinary scent of their lives: onion bagels, wet socks, tea rings, Mr. Dwyer\u2019s particular cologne which he swore was a soap.\n\n\u201cDo we count the thunder,\u201d Julian asked, sprawled on the floor with his hands behind his head like a person demonstrating that you could live here, in this moment, without convincing anyone.\n\n\u201cYou count for distance,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cI count for company.\u201d He lay beside him, close enough to feel the version of heat that is simply another body being permitted to exist near yours. He could hear Julian breathe and could hear his own breath trying to match and failing, and he let it fail for once without calling it a problem. Tux patrolled the border between them like a lifeguard in an era when swimming was suspicious.\n\nA knock came, the polite kind, like rain had learned table manners. Mae stood on the porch with a lantern of the old-fashioned battery variety and a raincoat whose hood made her look like someone being smuggled into a better story. \u201cI brought these,\u201d she said, handing over two lanterns as if offering time for their use. \u201cAnd this,\u201d and she produced a roll of blue tape. \u201cFor leaving messages you aren\u2019t ready to find.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a sense of humor,\u201d Julian said, grinning, because he liked discovering other people\u2019s tools.\n\n\u201cI borrow it,\u201d she said. Her hair had found rain in a way that made all other waters seem implausible. She looked past them into the house with the respectful interest of someone entering a gallery. \u201cYour windows are doing their best.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tell them that,\u201d Elaine said, taking the lanterns with thanks that sounded like a little hymn. \u201cYou could stay,\u201d she added, as if the offer had been pre-agreed by the walls.\n\n\u201cI would, but my cat does not believe in democracy,\u201d Mae said. \u201cAlso, my neighbor thinks this is the best weather for telling you about his knees.\u201d She touched the blue tape to her knuckle and then peeled it away in a gesture that felt ceremonial. \u201cKeep your chain on. Lightning is a door with no respect for invitations.\u201d She disappeared into the rain with the purposeful gait of people who believe in the concept of elsewhere.\n\nThey placed the lanterns on the mantle and the floor, and the light they made was the kind that forgives dust. The storm settled into its work: long bellies of thunder rolling tight against each other, white veins of light writing with bad grammar. The house made its corresponding sounds, small sympathetic creaks like affirmations. Cornelius listened for voices the way a person listens for their name in a crowd and heard, for once, none. The quiet felt earned rather than ominous.\n\nJulian read to them from the house book, Chapter Whatever, his voice even and a little amused at the author\u2019s earnestness, and the sentences did useful work, telling them about porches that remember feet and thresholds that document loyalties. Elaine dozed with her mouth just open enough to be human; Tux took this opportunity to inspect her face as if betrayed by its unguardedness. A gust pushed its broad hand against the front door in a way that made the chain identify itself out loud.\n\nWhen the storm had moved on to flatter places to impress, the house let its muscles go. They didn\u2019t talk about weather the way you talk about people after they leave; they passed around the topic like a bowl and then set it down. The power returned in fits\u2014one attempt that made the refrigerator clear its throat, a second that convinced the hallway light to cough, and finally a steady thrum that made the microwave proud again. The lanterns were turned off with a pat each, the way you treat small animals.\n\nIn bed, Cornelius listened to the water complaining in the gutter downspouts and to the small, reliable lie of rain after storm telling you it had always had proportion. He put his hand on the chain as if it were a stethoscope. He did not expect a note after his week without; he expected the feeling of not expecting, which is a complicated thing to hold under your tongue. In the morning there was no paper, only a faint crescent where condensation had dried in the exact place his forehead had rested against the stairs window during some other version of himself. He counted that, too.\n\nIn the following days, the town wore its storm habits like a cardigan. Branches arranged themselves into narratives across sidewalks. The man with the dog on Berkley cut the leaves with the seriousness of trimming a bad haircut. On Church Road, the office where Dr. Vale lived had a dark stripe up its stucco belly like a fight it had decided not to win. The cactus in the waiting room looked older as if thunder ages spines. \u201cWe survived drama,\u201d Dr. Vale said, tipping their head at the plant. \u201cI am not saying it liked it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hate it,\u201d Cornelius said, surprising himself with the admission. He sat and felt the exact rectangle where the lantern had rested on the carpet as if it had imprinted something into his body. \u201cIt made me honest. I didn\u2019t miss a bead for a while.\u201d He told them about the lanterns and the blue tape and the lack of voices, about lightning as rude doors and the chain feeling purposeful rather than medicinal.\n\nDr. Vale stretched in their chair, the vertebrae doing a miniature version of rain on a porch roof. \u201cAbsence can be a presence,\u201d they said. \u201cI am told monks have known this for some time. My experience with monks is limited to a bakery, but their advice on bread and sorrow tends to check out.\u201d They pointed their chin gently toward him. \u201cWhat would it be like if the notes were company and not instructions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am practicing that,\u201d he said. \u201cI even ate pie from the tin without asking permission.\u201d He told them about the neighbor\u2019s ribbon and the sensation of not finishing on purpose. \u201cI think I\u2019m trying to do everything slower, but not like a virtue. More like a temperature.\u201d\n\n\u201cRooms have their own climate,\u201d they said. \u201cYou\u2019re allowing the house to set you rather than the other way around. I approve. Don\u2019t let it bully you into humidity.\u201d\n\nWork became a minor Eden after the storm in the way that people who move boxes for a living know to be grateful for: the power had not gone out in their section of the strip mall, the backup generator had performed as intended, and the air inside had the blessed consistency of a refrigerator. The bolts were themselves again, proudly standardized in heft. A customer came in looking for a very particular washer and brought with him the smell of a house full of books and a cat. \u201cThis one,\u201d Cornelius said after three honest tries, placing in the man\u2019s palm the ring of metal that knew itself. \u201cYou can tell because it resists being needed.\u201d The man laughed and said he had never met a washer he didn\u2019t suffer for, and Cornelius experienced the odd pleasure of being someone else\u2019s reliable story by dinnertime.\n\nJulian started to keep a list of things he liked at his new job and taped it to the inside of a kitchen cabinet where no one would see but everyone might feel: the precise way the scanner warms up, Shaila\u2019s whistle when she thinks no one can hear her, the smell of old paper when the humidity changes, the sense that data can forgive if courted properly, the one decrepit ficus near the back exit trying to join the conversation. He showed it to Cornelius over toast and then half-apologized by calling it corny and then took the apology back because some mornings he could see which words were unnecessary and unkind to himself.\n\nElaine\u2019s Thursday grew in rings like a tree of appetite. The third week, a woman who had not been invited came with carrot salad and an apology that had been through three drafts. She sat and talked about gutters as if the word required accompaniment, and by the end of the night she had told them the kind of story that usually gets a person asked to leave rooms, and no one asked her to. The house takes on tasks when the people inside it let it, and on Thursdays, this house learned how to be a soft place on purpose.\n\nMr. Dwyer fell off a ladder and did it with enough flourish to make a parable. It was not a high ladder and he had not been warned by cherubs. He had gone up to retrieve a frying pan from the top of his pantry, where he kept things that made him feel secure for their inaccessibility, and the fourth rung had admitted to years. He came down wrong, that plain violent phrase, and sat down in his kitchen like a man who has decided to try sitting in other parts of the house for variety. He called no one because he had been born in an era that taught men wounds were personal curiosities. He walked over two hours later, his pride unrumpled, and stood in the doorway with a forearm he insisted was \u201conly dramatic.\u201d\n\nElaine sent him to urgent care with a tone that could make butter set. He returned with a sling and instructions to overthink nothing and ibuprofen in a bottle that looked like a small, cheerless building. He accepted both like knighthoods. Cornelius fixed the frying pan handle because some acts of care are better expressed in torque. \u201cI don\u2019t like the sensation of being advised,\u201d Mr. Dwyer confessed, rotating his shoulder as if the words could oil it. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s the age.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdvice isn\u2019t a verdict,\u201d Cornelius said, and Mr. Dwyer made a face that suggested this sentence fit in his wallet.\n\nMae began to exist in the corners of his week the way a refrain realizes it\u2019s a chorus. He saw her at the library one evening when he went to return the house book because someone else should be allowed to be told that windows get tired. She stood with a teenage boy, demonstrating how to reattach the cover to a paperback with cloth tape and love. The boy pretended not to care and then cared. She saw Cornelius and raised her hand like a pledge in reverse. They exchanged nothing that looked like confession. Later, he found a blue-taped square on the outside of the library\u2019s automatic door with neat handwriting: Doors that open themselves also deserve thanks. \u2014M. He did not peel it up. The thought of strangers walking in and being made more polite warmed a part of him that had been cold since he was eight, when he first understood that public kindness was both rare and contagious.\n\nOn a bright and unambitious Sunday, the planes were aggressive with their punctuality. They made their line like an arpeggio you are proud to know by name. He and Julian sat on the wrong hill with the right reactions. Teenagers slid down the grass on flattened boxes because youth is a series of experiments in friction. A small girl in a yellow dress described the sky to a patient aunt as if auditioning to be weather. \u201cYou count,\u201d Julian said between sips of the coffee that now had his mouth belonging to a particular morning. \u201cI\u2019ll conduct.\u201d\n\nCornelius counted. He let himself get lost twice and then found himself once and considered the math fair. He said the numbers out loud because the numbers liked it. When he reached one and nothing arrived, the old sensation of the bead skipping its turn rose and then, like someone careful on stairs, lowered itself. He breathed for two counts longer than felt intuitive and the next plane presented its silver intention and he nodded to it as to a neighbor with good fences.\n\n\u201cI saw your list,\u201d he said to Julian. \u201cIn the cabinet. I think you are allowed to like things without hiding them in cupboards. For next time.\u201d He did not blush or apologize; it was a sentence you could inhabit standing up.\n\nJulian turned his head, his mouth doing that half-considering thing that reminded Cornelius of gentle hinges. \u201cI\u2019m trained to believe that liking things gets you mocked. It is a school event.\u201d\n\n\u201cChoose different students,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cInvite yourself to a nicer lunch table.\u201d\n\nThey did not hold hands. They did not need to prove anything to a hill. A breeze found the exact spot where Cornelius\u2019s shirt didn\u2019t meet his skin and made the kind of suggestion you agree to. He turned his face into it and thought of the chain as jewelry again, and the sash weight in the corner of his room reciting its single poem, and the blue tape folded in his wallet in case of emergency gratitude.\n\nThe store needed him because a man had bought the wrong anchors and blamed the wall. The man had a vein in his forehead like an underlined word. He said the word \u201cquality\u201d like it owed him back rent. Cornelius thought of posting a sign in the aisle: It is not a sin to change plans. He took the man to the proper package and exchanged nothing but competence. After the man left, Dina from returns said, \u201cYou\u2019re good at making people less embarrassing,\u201d and he accepted the praise into his ledger under the category Useful.\n\nIn the evening, he and Elaine rebuilt a drawer. It had lived a hard life with the previous family, whose child had been an early years drummer. The bottom had shrugged under the weight of T-shirts and worry. They bought new bottom, as Mr. Dwyer insisted on saying, and slid it into place with a relief that made the room exhale. Elaine told him, over the discovery of a long-lost sock that predated the house, that she dreamed lately of trains and of everyone they had ever been standing on a platform politely waiting for the correct self to arrive. \u201cWe were all wearing similar coats,\u201d she said, smiling as if at a bad chorus line that had tried bravely. \u201cI like that. It means if I get the wrong one, it will still keep me warm.\u201d\n\nHe found a note that night not in his room or the kitchen or the civilized interior of his wallet but in the car, under the passenger seat, where it had collected crumbs and a small square of sun. The neat handwriting had withstood ash and grit. It read, You can let yourself be touched by what you like without giving it your keys. \u2014M. He folded it, toasted by heat and car, and slid it into the crack behind the radio as if returning it to the God of Dashboard.\n\nOn Tuesday, he forgot again. Not a bolt this time, but an hour. He looked at the clock and it stood at a precise time he had lived a hundred times and then it didn\u2019t, and the next thing he knew, he was rinsing tea mugs with the practiced circular motion his body employs when alone. He checked his phone: no calls made, no messages sent, no orders placed. He checked his pockets: one washer, a receipt with onions\u2014always onions\u2014priced at a number that made him laugh, and a blue tape square with a corner folded as if indicating a book he would revisit. He did not panic. He sat on the bottom stair and let the house speak in its harmless bones. He did a thing he had seen children do when they realize they have not been paying attention in class: he wrote by hand the words Here and Now on his palm and did not mind if anyone saw. Julian came in, saw, grinned, and wrote Here and Later on his own hand, lower down, just above where your life line is rumored to make deals.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Julian said, sitting with him so their knees thought about each other politely. \u201cTell me one small thing, and then two, that anchored in that hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteam on the sink,\u201d Cornelius said immediately, grateful for the game as if it were fruit. \u201cThe way the towel decided to be a river. A plane turned too slowly,\u201d he added, closing his eyes to see it better, \u201cand became something else and then back, like acting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s three,\u201d Julian said. \u201cOverachiever. See? You were alive.\u201d\n\nThey went to the Wawa and did not make it an event. The parking lot had the mood of a Monday even though it was not. A man in a suit practiced sincerity on a phone near the air pump. The woman at the register had on glitter eyeliner like apology for the concept of convenience stores at the hour when people lose their stamina. They bought two apples and two coffees and a bag of pretzels pretending to be crafted. On the way out, someone behind them said \u201cMae?\u201d in the now familiar register, a dim hall calling, but the person who turned was wearing a shirt that said STANFORD with all the letters intact and had a ponytail that apologized for nothing. He could feel the part of him that might have turned anyway growing used to the petting of that voice. He let it go. He could let many things go and not become less.\n\nHis mother, post-wedding, post-Thursday, began to take naps. She did it with shame first, and then with competence, and finally with pride. She lay on the couch and threw an arm over her face in the universal posture of brave surrender, and the house played the soft opera of plates settling so she would not feel unaccompanied. Rick attempted the learning of naps and failed, his naps becoming meetings with himself that overshot their agenda. \u201cI will get there,\u201d he told the cat, who had never tried a thing she did not already know she was good at.\n\nThere was a Sunday\u2014they were accruing, he was saving them\u2014when the hill received them with particular hospitality. The grass had recovered its plurality of greens. The planes made their music without needing to be named, and the toddlers were excellent ships. They lay back and watched the tops of trees move like gossip among old friends. \u201cTell me,\u201d Julian said, \u201csomething you could never have said a year ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like not knowing,\u201d Cornelius said, and each word embarrassed him separately and then they did their teamwork and embarrassed him less. He put his hands behind his head because honesty is treated better by the body in that position. \u201cEverything was neat when I was frightened. Now some things are in piles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like your piles,\u201d Julian said. \u201cThey\u2019re tidy enough to prove you mean it.\u201d\n\nThey did not kiss. They did exercise their right to stay in the exact emotional place they had sailed to with their own arms. It was not laziness. It was seamanship. In the parking lot, on their way to the car, Cornelius stopped short and pointed at a plane that wasn\u2019t one: a small kite in the shape of a stingray moving with insolent agreement with the sky. \u201cI want that,\u201d he said, which was either a sentence about toys or the kind of declaration you make eight months into practicing wanting things that might be allowed to happen.\n\nThey bought a kite. The day had made room for it. The string trembled in his fingers in a way that made him think of old jewelry. He let the wind tell it who it was. He looked, only once, down at the ground to make sure the hill did not resent him for preferring the air for a second, and the hill looked amused at his need for approval and told him to go on. The kite rode the seam between performance and flight and he did not correct it. Julian held the string when asked and did not let it go even when his hands stung in that clean way you remember when your skin has begged not to be useless. They brought it down in the slow deliberate motion that belongs to both surgeons and bakers and men who are allowed to keep pleasure for later.\n\nThat night, he found on the stairs window a smear where a finger had written and wiped and written again. It caught him because the evening had turned the glass into a chalkboard. He touched the spot and felt the cooled outline of a vowel. He breathed on the glass and the word arrived, a negative, a ghost of graphite: Stay. It was not signed. It did not need to be. He laughed, not loudly, just enough to make his ribs say, Yes, this. He put no blue tape around it. He did not show anyone immediately. In the morning it was gone, and he liked that the house had a broom for such things, and that whoever had written it believed he was the kind of person who would obey without keeping evidence pinned under glass.\n\nIn the small, serious hours when the store was closed and the refrigerator woke up to complain in the way of appliances whose owners had spoken to them rudely, he woke with a feeling as precise as a phone alarm. He lay there and let it ring. He did not get up. He did not go find paper. He put his hand out into the dark until he found the sash weight, hung where it belonged now, a dark sentence at the corner of the room. He closed his fingers around it briefly, and felt the correctness of the cold, and heard, somewhere inside himself where cheap metaphors go to die and good ones resurrect, the smooth click of something seating into threads exactly made for it. He slept after that with the basic gratitude of a person who can tell the difference between heavy and bad and has proof in his palm and the wrong hill outside doing its right job whether anyone thanked it or not.",
