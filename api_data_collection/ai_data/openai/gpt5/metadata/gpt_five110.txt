On mornings like that, Cologne sounded like a city that had turned itself inside out. The cathedral’s bells drifted across the river mist, the barges muttered along the Rhine, and somewhere a tram squealed like a violin string in a hand that refused to let go. He stood in his kitchen with the kettle clicking, a lawyer in shirtsleeves balancing the economy of vowels the way he balanced clauses and precedents, eyes on the window where a gray sky leaned its heavy head against the old roofs.

Lukas had learned to warm up quietly, a scale in the back of his throat, breath like a short prayer. The kettle popped and he startled; he’d already been awake two hours. There was a contract for a plastics manufacturer in a ring binder open on the table. There was also a print-out of the email he had read twelve times since yesterday afternoon:

Dear Mr. Weitner, After deliberation, we are delighted to invite you to the Final of X-Factor...

He had tried reading it in different voices. An angry judge. A rich aunt. A bored colleague. Only one voice fit: the boy he had been, the chorister under the dark nave, swallowing a Latin word like a coin. He stirred honey into his tea without looking and missed the cup. Sticky threads webbed between spoon and saucer.

You’re in the final, he told himself, and the word final felt like both endings and beginnings, which was apt, wasn’t it, for a man whose life had always been two doors opening simultaneously.

His phone buzzed, face down, face up. He thought: producers again, or Alina, or—no. It was his brother Jonas. He let the vibration run its course, two rings, three, then he answered, because he couldn’t not.

“Luk,” Jonas said, voice soft with that early-morning roughness that had always sounded like a secret. “You awake? Stupid question, you’re probably drafting a contract in your sleep.”

“You’re awake, which is the miracle,” Lukas said. He made it light, kept his voice balanced on a thin line because with Jonas it was always a line. “Did you get my message? About the email?”

“Yeah.” There was background noise, a saucepan maybe, or a pot lid clanging. “I saw. Big man. X-Factor. I told the guys at the shop. They said, you? And I said, my brother? Yes. He sings in a suit, but he sings.”

He didn’t know whether to be warmed by the pride or wince at the jab. “I don’t always wear a suit.”

“You’re probably wearing one now.”

“It’s seven forty-five.”

“And you're already late,” Jonas said in a showman’s voice, and then the pause lengthened into something else, something that filled the line with breath and no words. “Listen, could I borrow the Golf? Just today. I need to pick up something out of town.”

“The Golf is my only way in to the office. We’ve got a meeting with Seidel and the Belgian clients at nine.”

“Take the tram for once. You love the tram. Urban lawyer. Paper under your arm, coffee in a compostable cup.”

Lukas looked at the keys on the hook, the small indented letters VW. “You know this week is chaos, right? Rehearsals and contracts and I need the— We’ll talk later. I’ll see you later.”

“Later,” Jonas echoed, in a tone that made later sound like a promise he wasn’t sure he could keep.

When he ended the call, the kettle was cooling with a hollow drip. He cleaned the honey spill, burned his finger, stuck it in his mouth like he was five. There, he thought. Everything is ordinary. Then he picked up his briefcase, slipped the email into the back pocket of his jacket, as if having it physically close might make it less likely to vanish into the day like a dream.

In the office, the glass clung to everything: glass walls, glass door, glass smiles. Cologne’s business district felt like a place that had convinced itself it could be another city if it reflected enough sky. He rode up to the sixth floor and nodded at receptions and gossips and the smell of stale coffee. Dr. Seidel had a tie with tiny compasses on it; he was the sort of partner who liked metaphors. He clapped Lukas on the shoulder in a way that meant three things at once: you are useful, you are not as useful as you think, watch out.

“Congratulations,” Seidel said. The syllables clicked in his mouth like dice, carefully thrown.

“You heard?”

“Annika told me, Annika hears everything.” Seidel’s smile did something it didn’t know it did: it widened and un-widened around the edges. “X-Factor. Hm. Good for morale, I suppose.”

“It’s on Saturday,” Lukas said. “The final. I’ll be back Monday. There are rehearsals, but I can—”

“You can.” Seidel sat, lifted a file, let it fall again. “Just remember, at Weitner, Brunn & Seidel, we support our people’s hobbies until they stop being hobbies. Do you know what I mean?”

Lukas nodded. He knew that Seidel meant: the firm would clap as long as he made the firm look good. The firm would stop clapping the moment his face was on a screen where it wasn’t supposed to be, leaning into a microphone, showing his throat.

Annika blew a strand of hair out of her eyes and grinned at him from the doorway later with a coffee he didn’t ask for. “You’re going to win. If you don’t win, I will claim to have never known you. And then I will claim you again if your video gets a million views.”

“Your loyalty terrifies me,” he said. He liked Annika because she wore her cleverness like a slanted hat; she never put it down.

“You going to sing in German?” she asked. “Something real? Not the usual pop-jelly?”

He thought of all the songs he had circled and crossed out. He thought of the cathedral choir and a German lullaby that had soothed him through nights when his father shouted and Jonas laughed to drown him out. “Fix You,” he said. “I’ve been working on an arrangement. Just me, electric piano, no strings, no fireworks.”

“You and your anti-fireworks,” Annika said. Then, softer: “Your brother going to watch?”

“He’ll watch,” Lukas said, like a prayer he didn’t know the shape of. “He’ll try.”

At lunch, he stepped into a quiet lane near Apostelnkirche because Alina couldn’t abide the echoing corridors or the click of heels. She worked at the Stedischen kindergarden in Ehrenfeld and had a gift for talking to children and plants and complicated men who didn’t always know they needed to be talked to. She said, “I knew it,” before he said hello, and laughed when he told her she always stole his thunder, and then said, “Your mother called me.”

“My mother,” Lukas said. “That would be a sentence I didn’t expect today. What for?”

“She said she’s proud,” Alina said, and he almost dropped the phone. “Or she said the closest thing she can say.”

“What did she actually say?”

“She said, ‘I saw Lukas on the internet,’ and then she talked about the neighbor’s cat. It’s progress.”

“Progress,” he murmured, and watched an old man shuffle by with a bag of bread, pigeons rising like shaken cloth.

“Is Jonas okay?” Alina asked.

“Why wouldn’t he be?”

“Because it’s you in the lights. Because he loves you except when he doesn’t. Because he will find a way to make this about him if he can’t make it about you.”

“That’s unkind,” Lukas said, reflexively.

“It’s true,” she said, gently. “I hope I’m wrong. I’d like to be wrong. I love him in that way you love stray dogs with golden eyes.”

Lukas closed his eyes. He saw Jonas in the yard behind their parents’ house rolling a soccer ball with one bare foot, laughing and ducking, eyes too bright. Jonas building things with no plans, a shelf for a girl he loved, a table that tilted one way if you leaned and the other if you sighed, as if responding to gravity in the middle of the room. Jonas singing into a bottle as if it were a microphone, making the world his audience. He saw him at eighteen, eyes burning, telling their father he would not be a soldier of industry, that he would not use the measuring tape like a leash.

“I’ll call him later,” Lukas said. He could hear Alina smile.

He didn’t call him later.

It was not on purpose. The day folded itself into tasks; the night creaked open and he ate soup at his desk, learned a song inside his chest until it seemed to grow bones. He flicked through text messages, answered three producers’ calls, told his mother again to stop saying “We are on television” as if she had been born into his throat. He reached for Jonas’s name and his phone lit with a call from Seidel, and then from a number he didn’t know, from Berlin, from a florist (Alina, who else), from the past, from the future, and when the clock on his computer reached eleven forty-three, he told himself that late-night calls made everything worse. Tomorrow. He would go by Jonas’s workshop, he would bring coffee and that apple pastry with the crumb top that Jonas pretended to hate but never failed to finish, he would talk and it would be fine. He believed that small lie because it was the kind that made sleep possible.

When his phone finally rang with police sirens in the background, the paragraphs he had been writing broke apart like biscuits in hot tea. He stood. The voice said his name. He had to say three times I am his brother, yes I am, before the voice settled into that rhythm you learn young when bad things happen to people you love: measured, procedural, not unkind. There had been an accident. On the B55 near Ossendorf. A single car. No one else involved. Serious injuries. He heard the word intubated and the world narrowed so sharply it whistled.

He drove to the hospital with his hands clamped on the wheel, body leaning forward as if the angle could change physics. He turned left when the light was still red, and a woman shrieked at him from her bicycle, and he mouthed I’m sorry at the empty street and wasn’t. He thought about the Golf and winced because he had told Jonas no, but the Golf was not at his flat, so—he made a noise, a bark that could have been laughter if something in it hadn’t been broken. He turned on the radio and then turned it off. The cathedral flickered through buildings on his right, an outline stenciled into a fog that had dropped lower as if the city were holding its heavy breath.

In the emergency department, the lights were too bright in that way that made your thoughts seem cheap. He said his name at the desk. He sat where the nurse pointed, next to a poster about the signs of stroke. He watched a little boy in a Spiderman shirt with a broken arm crying with the wrung-out weeping of a person who had learned to cry small. He watched his own feet, and then his hands. Alina came, because she had a sixth sense for absence and emergencies and the way his voice thickened when he said it's fine, I’m fine, everything is fine. She sat and lifted the corner of his jacket to slide a hand into his like a note.

After a while, a doctor with hair gelled into careful spikes walked them down a long corridor, explaining injury in terms of systems: trauma to the thoracic cavity, a lacerated spleen, compound fracture of the femur (muttered words, left main artery? lucky it stopped there). He said the words we hope, and then he said, “Are there any allergies we should know about?”

“Peanuts,” Lukas said automatically, though it wasn’t relevant. There was a moment—ridiculous—when he thought, that we should be talking about peanuts, as if knowledge were a charm. Then he saw Jonas.

He had always been large in a room, not because of his height but because of the energy, a wind that moved through chairs and cups and people. On the bed he was small. There were tubes where his words should have been. His leg was in a gray brace. His mouth had a demarcation of blood at the corner. His eyelashes looked like someone had painted them, trembling on the edge of a man still there.

“Jonas,” he said, and the name was useless because Jonas couldn’t hear him. Or maybe he could. The machines breathed where he could not. They had arranged him into a person-shaped answer to a question that had not yet been asked.

A nurse with tired eyes said, “We got him here fast. That helps. He has some movement in his left hand.” She said it like offering a small candle in a tunnel.

He held Jonas’s left hand, careful of the IV taped to the back. He squeezed once, and then again. He wanted to tell him everything and nothing. He wanted to make the night back up four hours like a truck with a warning beep. He spoke to Alina without looking at her. “How did he—how—”

“The police said he hit the barrier,” Alina said. “No other cars. He wasn’t wearing a seat belt.”

Lukas closed his eyes. He saw the Golf, or not the Golf, because he had said no, but maybe Jonas had found the spare key, but that was stupid, no, this was the other car, the ancient Opel he kept running out of pride. Without the belt. He could hear their mother. He could hear their mother saying Boys, belts, belts, and their father saying, Let them be men, and Jonas laughing, and Lukas fastening his belt so tight it clicked like a promise.

He went out to the corridor and called his mother. She was awake. Of course she was awake. She said the things she said: to whom do we pray, what is the point, where are you. He told her not to come, not yet. He didn’t say because you will ask me whose fault this is and the answer will be me, always me, him, always him, and the room will fill like a cloud.

The producer called. Lukas stared at the name. He thought of ignoring it, but the thought of someone else in a headset, not knowing, talking too quickly, made his throat itch.

“Lukas,” the voice said in a tone that meant both hello and how are you and remember that we are a machine. “We heard. Somebody heard. A friend of a paramedic texted a makeup artist. Are you okay?”

“No,” Lukas said. “No, I’m not okay.” He realized he had walked back to the window where he could see his brother’s foot under the blanket, an absurdly human detail. “He’s in critical care. I don’t know.”

“Of course. God. We’re so sorry.” The voice paused, weighted empathy, and then: “We’ll need to know about your schedule. For tomorrow. There’s rehearsal with the band at two. If you can’t—”

“Can’t,” he said. “I can’t.”

“Of course. We’ll work around.” The voice did a series of micro-calculations he could hear on the line. “I’m going to put down ‘family emergency’ in the notes. We’re here if you need, you know, anything.”

The word anything rang hollow. He hung up and immediately hated that he had. He wanted to call back and ask, could you send a magic word through this receiver and make his chest rise and fall because he wants to. He wanted to stand at a microphone and sing the shape of the pain out of the room.

He didn’t sleep. The bones of the night made noise, small and then not small. At four, Jonas moved his hand again. At five, he opened his eyes. They were filmed over with drugs, the pupils both enormous and weirdly childlike. Lukas leaned forward so fast his spine protested. “Jonas,” he said, and Jonas furrowed his brow as if he were completing a puzzle in which the lines needed to be darker.

“Don’t,” Jonas said eventually, around the plastic, or it wasn’t a word, it was a sound that had been a word before becoming what pain does to language. He blinked. “Luk.”

“I’m here,” Lukas said. He hadn’t needed to say it since they were small. He said it now like a mantra he needed and a curse.

Jonas looked at him as if he could see two of him, one in each corner of the bed. He moved his tongue against the tube, a frustration that made something in Lukas’s chest invert itself. The nurse came and checked vital signs and gave Jonas a teaspoon of water that did nothing good. When she left, Jonas’s breath sawed in the room with the rhythm of a blade. He lifted his hand and it drifted through the air, landed on Lukas’s sleeve, as if to say, let me anchor in you. He shifted, winced, winced like a person being sketched in pencil with too-hard lines.

“The car,” Jonas said, more air than sound.

“It doesn’t matter,” Lukas said reflexively, and then, because the word was too big, too bright, lied without meaning to: “You’re okay.”

The day arrived, dragging itself up through the slats of the blinds. Alina went home to shower and change and call his mother again, to eat a piece of toast she wouldn’t be able to swallow. Lukas stayed. He watched Jonas’s face take on more color and less, watched nurses change bags and write numbers. He thought of his song, the aching chord he’d arranged in the bridge that he liked because it sounded like a street after snow. He thought of the mouth of the microphone, the warm dark of the stage, the way he could look out and see nothing but possibility and fear arranged like lights. And he thought of the girl in the year above him in school who had cut her hair off in his bathroom and cried into a towel and asked him to sing while she decided who she was.

By midday, he had not eaten and had drunk enough coffee to make his hands tremble. He told himself he would step outside for five minutes of air, and then the doctor in careful spikes was there again, before the thought could even be finished.

“There’s still internal bleeding,” the doctor said. “We’re monitoring. There is risk of sepsis. Pain management is doing their best. He’s very agitated.”

“He hates being still,” Lukas said, and the doctor inclined his head, as if that piece of data could change anything.

After the doctor left, Jonas opened his eyes again and held them open with obvious effort. “You should go,” he said. “Rehearsal. Go. Sing.” The words were awkward, ruby pebbles, but they were words, and something like the old mischief, distilled, threaded them.

“It’s a television show,” Lukas said. “I’m not going to a television show while you—”

“Please.” Jonas swallowed around the air and the pain. He gathered a flicker of grin. “Sing so good they think it’s their idea you’re good.”

“Later,” Lukas said, because he could not say no or yes in a way that would not break something. He put a hand on his brother’s shoulder very gently and released it as if it were a lever that might trip something important.

At one, the producer called again. They talked about flights and the ethics of singing while your brother bled. At one thirty, Jonas coughed, and his face tightened in a way that made Lukas stand up so quickly the chair scraped and a nurse came and said, “We’ll adjust the morphine.” The morphine made Jonas’s edges blur. He became both less Jonas and more eternally himself, open in a way he never allowed when sober and sure.

“I took the Opel,” Jonas said suddenly. “Because you wouldn’t. I was going to bring you something. Flowers, that stupid pastry. I wanted—” He made a face like a boy contemplating an ant on a windowsill. “Wanted to make it about you. For once.”

Lukas felt heat flood his face, a shame so pure it almost made him want to kneel. “You idiot,” he said, and then, because that was wrong, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”

“Don’t be,” Jonas murmured. He moved his shoulder as if shrugging without strength. “I am going to be fine. And if I’m not, you’re going to sing anyway. Because that’s what you do. You make your mouth into a cathedral and people go inside.”

“Who told you that,” Lukas said. “Who put poetry in your soup.”

“You did,” Jonas said, and his mouth did a jagged line that could have been a smile, could have been a grimace. “Don’t be angry.”

Lukas wasn’t sure at whom he was angry. Himself, his brother, his mother’s God, the snow that wasn’t falling, the machine that sang his brother to absent sleep, the producer who had texted him a schedule while he watched his brother’s eyelashes catch the light. The day had gritted itself into his teeth. He wanted to bite something that would break. He wanted to be small enough to fit inside a pocket where nothing loud could reach him.

At three, Alina came back, soft with forgiveness for bulletins he had not yet managed to write. She sat and rubbed the bridge of her nose. “Your mother is coming,” she said. “She said not to worry. She’s bringing the blue sweater you always hated.”

“God,” he said. “Everything is happening wrong.”

The room grew quiet in the way that made every noise louder. Jonas slept. He slept with his mouth slightly open like a child, like a man. Lukas heard the whisper of air and the beep that he had come to hate because it stole his power in tiny increments. He stood, paced, sat. He wrote an email to Seidel and deleted it. He listened to a voicemail from Annika saying, “I’ll cover the Belgian calls. Go do what you need to do.” He looked at his shoes and thought: you are the shoes of a man trying to be two people, and you are not designed for this.

He wanted to go into the stairwell and yell into the brick. He walked into the corridor instead and discovered the odd uncharitable desire to slam his fist into the vending machine. Use your words, he told himself in the voice of their fourth-grade teacher. He walked the length of the hall and back.

When he returned, Jonas was awake, and the light had shifted into late afternoon, which is when ordinary things turn sharp. Alina had gone to find tea. His mother had texted I'm at the tram stop, which meant twenty minutes of dread.

“Luk,” Jonas whispered. “Don’t leave.”

“I’m not leaving,” Lukas said, and then his phone did it, it hummed, little insect-buzz, the producer’s number, and he, man of words, man of clarity, did the one thing he always scolded himself for doing: he answered and tried to have two conversations at once.

“Five minutes,” the producer said. “We’ve changed the arrangement for you. The key. Can you get to Berlin tonight? There’s a late flight at nine. We can—”

“No flights,” Lukas said. He heard the thinness in his own voice, the way it had been stretched. “No. I’m here.”

“Look, the story, Lukas,” the producer said, and there it was, the word that made his skin go cold. “It’s a lot. The audience. If you… if you’re there tomorrow, it’s extraordinary. If you can’t, we understand, of course, but we need to know. Do we let the understudy do the song? Do we rehearse for an empty spot?”

“Understudy,” he repeated, stupidly, because he had not thought of his own life as a part with an understudy. He imagined someone else in his place under the lights, someone else putting his mouth to the microphone. The anger came up so fast it fizzed behind his eyes. “You have an understudy for me.”

“We have contingencies for everyone,” the voice said, professional sorrow, and he pressed the phone to the bed, almost without realizing.

Jonas looked at him, and something about the angle of his mouth was bad. Or maybe everything was bad. “He wants you to go,” Jonas said. “Please.”

“I don’t want anything,” Lukas said. “I want five lives.”

“Only two,” Jonas said. “And you’re using both.” He coughed, a careful cough, and his face went ashy. Lukas reached for the call button and Jonas batted his hand weakly away. “I’m fine.”

He wasn’t fine. The monitors escalated their panic-piping. A nurse came in and did things quick and deft and smiled with a mouth that could not have felt like smiling. “Little drop in blood pressure,” she said. “We’re on it.”

Lukas stood in the corner feeling like he had been put there. The nurse left. The machine calmed slightly. Jonas sagged. “He thinks I’m a story,” Lukas said, meaning the producer and the entire show. He wanted to climb inside the machine and pull all the bones of it apart with his teeth.

“Everybody is a story,” Jonas said. “You want it or you don’t. You pick. Luk.” He closed his eyes as if the words cost him more than they could have. “This is stupid.”

“What is stupid?” Lukas asked. He hated how the question sounded, plaintive and small.

“Me,” Jonas breathed. “Seat belt, car, beer. Don’t. Don’t make that face. I had… I had two. Or three. I couldn’t not. I was thinking about how you always do everything right.” He managed an irritated laugh that seeped like air. “You annoy me.”

The world tilted. It did. Lukas felt nausea climb him, a vine. He said nothing because if he said something he would say too much. Jonas licked his lips, the most human gesture. “I… wanted to see you fall,” he said, and then, eyes flicking open in panic, “No. No. I didn’t. God. I didn’t. I wanted to see you fly. If you fell, I’d be there, laughing. And then helping. Both.” He made a face that was disgust and fear. “I’m not saying it right.”

“You never did,” Lukas said. He meant to smile. He didn’t.

Alina appeared in the doorway with a paper cup and the soft way she had of entering a room. “Your mother is in the lobby,” she said. “She’s arguing with a volunteer about where to park grief.”

“Of course she is,” Lukas said, and his chest ached with something like wild love and like flint.

He went out to get his mother because he needed movement, needed an action he could perform that had a beginning and an end. He found her jaw tight, hair pulled back, hands already in a pose that meant she was ready to be disappointed by the world. He hugged her, and she resisted for a fraction of a second as if hugging were a game she hadn’t practiced in years, and then she held him so hard he thought his ribs might bruise. She said his name like a refusal to say any other. “Where,” she said. He guided her.

In the room, she clicked her tongue at Jonas as if he were nine, then covered her mouth, and then touched his foot because the face was too much. Her eyes did a thing he had seen once when lightning struck the tree in their yard and for a second the tree was both there and not-there. She began a low muttering in a dialect they hadn’t heard since their grandmother died. It took Lukas a second to understand that his mother was praying to someone she was not sure she believed in, in a language she had always used to scold.

There was a moment of peace because grief had arranged itself into a posture. They stood like a triptych: mother sitting, head bowed, son awake but floating, other son upright like a stick that had learned to be a person. And then the peace left the room because the producer called again, the phone humming with persistence, and Lukas, who should have learned by now, answered.

“You can’t call him now,” his mother said child-soft, but she didn’t understand, and why should she, that the voice in his ear was a piece of the life he had, a life she had not really seen. “Who is it? Who is it who thinks they have a right?”

“It’s the show, Mama,” he said, not looking away from Jonas because he couldn’t. “It’s the thing I— It’s fine. I’ll say no. I’ll say—”

“You’ll say what you want,” his mother said, and he noted, in a corner of his racing mind, that she was telling him a thing she had never told him, and he almost wanted to laugh except that it came out strangled.

On the phone, the producer said something about a car waiting outside to take him to the station if he was ready. Lukas looked at his brother, at the bandages peeking like promises from under the hospital blanket. He imagined leaving. He imagined walking out into a damp Cologne evening, getting into a car with a driver smiling too much, being carried along the rails to Berlin, stepping into the heat of the set, mouth on the dark star of the microphone, singing a song about fixing things when some things cannot be fixed. He imagined winning and it tasting like rust.

“Don’t,” Jonas said. A bare whisper. To the producer? To Lukas? To the possibility that the car outside existed. “Don’t turn me into—” He couldn’t finish. He didn’t need to.

Lukas ended the call without a word. He could feel the anger forming, not like a storm this time, but like a blade someone was sharpening in the dark. It was old, older than Jonas’s driving, older than the audition he hadn’t told their mother about until he had to. It was a narrow thing, made of moments: the time Jonas had thrown his shoebox of song drafts into the yard for fun; the time their father had praised Jonas for building a shelf in an afternoon and told Lukas he would never build anything that mattered with his hands; the time Jonas had not come to the one performance that already felt like salvation; the time he came and heckled so he wouldn’t cry; the time, the time, the time. A memory of blood on Jonas’s knuckles, a mirror cracked in their teenage bedroom, laughter in a pitch that hurt.

He watched his brother’s mouth form his name again, and something in him pivoted on that thin knife. He was not sure whether what he felt was love that had been turned the wrong way or hate that had been marinating in love for thirty years. He was not sure if the room had grown smaller or if he had grown to fill it until there was no oxygen left.

Alina touched his elbow. It anchored him and did not. His mother said something about soup because she could not figure out where to put her hands.

“Take a walk,” Alina whispered. “Go. I’ll sit. He’ll be sleeping. Go breathe, Lukas.”

“I don’t need—” he began, and then he did. He stepped into the corridor, walked to the end and back. He looked at the balled, abandoned tissues in a plastic chair, a newspaper folded at the puzzle page, a vending machine flashing out. He pressed his forehead to the cool fire door because he needed something cold. He remembered the email in his pocket like a hot coin. He took it out and crumpled it and smoothed it and crumpled it, his hands doing child things because his mind had left.

When he went back in, the monitors were calm as a boxed sea. Alina had gone to the bathroom. His mother was staring at the blue sweater in her lap like it was a map and she had forgotten how to read. Jonas’s eyes were closed, but the crease between his eyebrows had not unfurrowed. Lukas stood at the bed and smoothed the sheet because it had rumpled into mountains. His fingers trembled. He hated the tremble more than he had ever hated anything. He put his hand on the railing and listened to the plastic creak.

“Luk,” Jonas said, lips barely moving. He opened his eyes in a painful shuttered way and somehow found Lukas’s face in the light. “You look like Papa when you’re angry.”

Something in the room broke. It might have been a sound; it might have been nothing you could hear. Lukas didn’t mean to do anything. He didn’t come with a plan. He didn’t think, not one step, and that was the most terrifying thing. He wanted Jonas to stop talking. He wanted the noise inside him to meet the noise outside him so they could cancel and maybe he could rest.

He reached for the pillow.

Later, he would not remember if he had thought, if he had counted. He would remember the texture of the cotton, a cheap hospital weave, the way his hands had to move the cannula aside, the way a tube tugged and he hated that tug for being a practical detail in a moment that had no room for such. He would remember his brother’s eyes going wide and then wider and then very close, the color of them a brown he had known since he learned what sight was. He would remember the sound of the oxygen sounding wrong, a plastic note, and the machine protesting a little too late. He would remember the sudden weight of silence when he was done, a cliff he had stepped off expecting a floor.

It did not take long. That was the most terrible thing. He saw Jonas’s face like the face of a boy in a garden after rain. He thought: it is not me, it is a hand the world has put on mine. He thought: I am saving him from the long road of sepsis and morphine and the way his words will keep arriving wrong. He thought a hundred thoughts in a second and none of them were true.

His mother made a sound, something that should have been an animal sound and yet was too human to be merciful. She rose and then stopped and then rose again and the blue sweater fell and the tea cup tipped and tea ran in a brown river across the linoleum. Alina stepped in with a paper towel and a smile prepared and stopped mid-step, mouth opening on a word that would never know what it wanted to be.

The machine did its duty. It called. The machine shouted its electronic complaint. Nurses came like a wave, a doctor, another, a voice saying, Sir, please, step aside, and another voice saying, How long has— and then, like a shutter falling on a window, the room was full of bodies and none of them were his brother’s.

Lukas stood with his hands clean because the pillow had been clean. That was the thing that made him choke. He had done something ancient and messy and his hands were unmarked. He looked down at them in disbelief, as if a stain might bloom belatedly like a bruise. He felt Alina’s gaze touch him and move away and return and he experienced the curiosity of seeing himself through her eyes, for a second, as a man she loved and could not recognize.

He did not pretend to cry. He did not pretend to faint. He stood and listened to the words the doctor had to say in a voice that held the shape of the day and smashed it: we regret, we did everything we could, he was very weak, there was nothing—

He heard himself making a noise. It sounded like a person. He heard his mother saying his name in the tone you use when you are calling a child home across a field at dusk. He thought of the email in his pocket and wished it would set fire to him quickly, wished for anything quick, clean, understandable.

Outside, the bells moved across the air. Cologne breathed. Someone laughed in the corridor. He imagined a car still waiting somewhere with a driver looking at his watch. He imagined a stage warmed by lights. He imagined his brother’s first bicycle with the white tires, the little dent on the bar where he, Lukas, had run it into the step because he always looked down. He imagined the world before he’d reached for the pillow, and because he was who he was, because he was a man with a mind that sorted and arranged and made sense of noise for a living, he knew: that world would never exist again. He didn’t know what would come next. He knew only that he had stepped. He had stepped into the dark and the dark kept him. He had stepped, and he would have to find a way to sing or never sing again, and both seemed equally impossible.

In the corridor, he noticed a smudge on the wall, a thumbprint in gray, and wondered who had put it there. He thought: my thumb, his thumb, nobody’s thumb, a nurse the size of a saint, someone who had eaten a pastry with sugar and then steadied themselves. He pressed his thumb into it and it did not fit. He left his own print beside it, without meaning to, a quiet, stupid mark. Then he walked back into the room where his mother had made her hands into a cup for grief and where Alina stood with a paper cup crumpled in her fist, and he tried to say a sentence without verbs. He tried to say, I am here.

He could not hear himself over the static in his head. He could hear the world and the world was very loud. He could feel the emptiness of a space that a presence had occupied, a hollow that his mind already knew would echo for as long as voices did. He picked up the blue sweater because it was something to pick up, and because it had weight, and because putting it on the chair felt, absurdly, like respect.

When the nurse asked about organ donation, he nodded at the wrong time. When the doctor said something about formalities, he signed his name where indicated with the hand that had been an instrument ten minutes earlier and now hoped to be a hand again, ordinary, empty, stupid, capable of holding and not of killing. He waited for the moment when the floor would come back. He did not know when it would, and if it would, and he stood and breathed and stood again, as if standing were all he knew how to do. Outside, the river went on, as if rivers had not learned how to stop. He would learn later how long everything took. He would learn things that could not be unlearned. Right then, he pressed the heel of his hand to his chest and felt it hurt, as if something inside were trying to make itself known, and failing, again and again, like a song you cannot quite remember going flat in your mouth.They came with clipboards and the soft soles of men who had learned to be quiet in corridors where quiet meant everything. Their jackets were a blue that tried not to be a color. The nurse at the station spoke to them in a low voice with her hand flattened on a page, and then one of the men lifted his eyes and found Lukas as if he had always known where he would be. He had a face that would have been kind if it hadn’t been required to make itself neutral over and over until neutrality had become its habit. He introduced himself, said his rank, said the other man’s name, said he was very sorry, and Lukas felt the words like coins dropped into a fountain where you could not see the bottom.

They asked about timelines first, because timelines were a way to make sense of holes. When did you arrive. Who was present. What did he say. How did he seem. Lukas discovered that his mouth could still do its work. He set the facts in a row the way he would line up clauses, tamping the little tendrils of feeling that wanted to sprout out of the edges. He said, “Around four, he woke for the first time, briefly. He was in and out. At one there was a drop in his blood pressure. The nurse adjusted medication. He slept. He spoke to me and my partner. My mother arrived.” He could see the officer’s pen pause and then go on at the word partner, which he had never said to a policeman before and which sounded like it belonged more to a company letterhead than to a life.

The other man, younger and with hair that had not yet learned to give up, asked gently whether Jonas had said anything about how the accident had happened, and there was the small pause that follows a lie through a room even when the lie is not yet spoken. Lukas said, “He said he wasn’t wearing a belt.” He did not say he had said two or three, beer. He did not say that, for a second, all the air between them had turned to glass. He did not say what they drank when they were teenagers behind the garage, that terrible schnapps that tasted like a prank, how they had both wanted to be men so badly they borrowed the worst parts first.

The older policeman turned to his mother with the politeness you bring to a chapel. She had put the blue sweater on, though she wore it over another sweater and looked both burning and frozen, a woman who didn’t know whether the temperature was too much or too little. “Frau Weitner,” he said, formal even with her yes, because formal was a respect. “Would you tell us, in your words.” She looked at him with an expression that had traveled through four decades of discipline and disappointment and arrived at an obstinacy that would not move. She said, in their grandmother’s dialect because it was the only way to make the sentences both palatable and adamant, that her son had suffered, that her son had died, that the machines had been loud, that everything after that was a blur. She said she had not seen, she had not seen, she had not seen. The repetition was a chant. She said it with her eyes on Lukas’s hands and then on his face and then on her lap where the wool lay like something she might knit if she ever learned how to forgive.

Alina kept her gaze on the floor. When the young officer asked her if she had noticed anything unusual, she said that grief was unusual to her every time and so yes, everything was unusual, and that the monitors had screamed and the nurses had been very fast and the tea had spilled and she hadn’t had time to be useful. Her voice was even, the evenness of a person teaching children to sit in a circle when the floor is lava. Only when the officer thanked her did she lift her head, briefly, and Lukas saw in her face not accusation and not absolution but the detonation of a thousand small adjustments she was making and would keep making if she stayed.

The clipboard said that because it was a single-vehicle accident and because of the speed of what had happened next and because he had been in critical care and because Germany had rules for everything, there would be a post-mortem examination. The word hung in the room with a smell like disinfectant. The officer said the body would be transferred to Rechtsmedizin once the hospital had finished with their formalities. He said again that he was sorry. He asked, as if it were a question about weather, whether Jonas had any enemies, any debts, any disputes in the last weeks. Lukas inhaled and felt the inhale scrape. He said, “No,” and then, because he despised how quickly the syllable had come, added with careful honesty, “He argued as a sport. He borrowed money the way other people borrow books. He always meant to return both.”

They took their leave with that weight that police carry when they are the face of the state and the state is a person you have only met in letters. They left a card with a name that looked like it belonged in a book you would not read unless you had to. When the door clicked shut, the noise returned to its normal size, which was somehow louder. His mother resumed her mutter. Alina put the cups in the bin because action was all we have.

Later, the hospital shepherded them through signatures and nods. A nurse with a kind mouth and a practical set to her shoulders asked about organs again, and his mother looked to Lukas, and Lukas looked to Alina, and Alina said softly that Jonas had once signed his donor card in a fit of righteousness and then eaten sausage with both hands and said he felt noble. The nurse smiled with gratitude that made Lukas want to lie down on the floor. The nurse explained that because there would be an investigation of the death, timing might be complicated, and they nodded because that was what there was to do. They followed the steps like a dance someone else had choreographed before they were born.

Outside, the evening had done what evening does; it had lifted itself out of a gray day with a kind of reluctant grace. Cars pushed their lights along like boats. A woman smoked under the awning with determination. Lukas felt the little click in his ears that came when the air changed, as if his body were climbing or descending very quickly, though he was only standing. He wanted to be motion; he wanted to run until all the nouns fell off him and he could be alone with verbs. He leaned against the lintel and dialed Seidel because a man made out of clauses might as well reach for a clause in a tie.

Seidel answered on the second ring as if he had been waiting, though that was unlikely unless Annika had told him, which she would have, because loyalty came in the shape of information in their office. He said the correct words first—what can we do, oh god, Lukas, I am sorry—and then he moved with admirable speed to scaffold. He said he could put Lukas in touch with a criminal defense colleague who was both discreet and very bored by tragedy, which made him efficient. He said that if the police wanted a formal statement, they should do it in a room with wood and glass, not in a corridor with vending machines. He said, and here his voice took on that place where meaning is, do not speak to anyone off the record, there is no off the record, and if anyone offers you a better kind of empathy than silence, they are not your friend.

Lukas thanked him with that professional gratitude that can sound like frost. He could picture Seidel, sleeves rolled, standing in his office with the tiny compasses on his tie pointing north no matter what happened to the room. He could hear Annika in the background somewhere, and he wanted her voice, and then he didn’t, because he would have to say something like my brother has died and I was in the room when he died, which was true and not true in the same way a mirror is true and not true.

He ended the call, and the producer texted. It was a long message that tried to be personal without the time to be personal. It said the show was thinking of him, which was a grammatical impossibility. It said they respected any decision he made and would make adjustments accordingly. It said the band could learn his arrangement without him and he could step in cold on Saturday if he felt able, and that the judges would be briefed, and that the audience loved a story about resilience. The little gray bubble that meant more was coming blinked for a long time and then delivered: we lost my uncle in March, and it made work both less and more important for a while, which was either an attempt at solidarity or a small colonization of his grief; he couldn’t tell which. He put the phone in his pocket and felt it there like a hot stone.

They took a taxi to his mother’s apartment because the night had gone thin and the tram’s squeal would lodge in his molars. In the cab, his mother sat straight up, her hands fist-closed in her lap as if she were holding herself by the threads. She asked questions in bursts like someone throwing darts at a moving board. Did he suffer. Did he say my name. Did you call your father. He answered what he could, omitted what he could not, let some questions fall between the seats. When she asked about his father, he shook his head because other ghosts could wait their turn. He watched the storefronts slide past—the lottery store with its dinosaur of a sign, the Turkish bakery where Jonas bought bread like a ceremony, the shuttered flower shop with its buckets and stems—and he had the unreasonable wish that someone would be open, that he might buy something ordinary and be asked whether he needed a receipt.

At her building, the air in the stairwell was damp and smelled like the particular mildew that lived there since 1978. She refused help with the bag she hadn’t needed and climbed as if climbing were something you do to prove a point to nobody. In the kitchen, she opened the fridge and then closed it and then opened it again as if food might become an answer if you insisted. She made tea and burned the first pot and made tea again and then did that thing she did when there were too many sentences: she began to clean. She took everything off a shelf and wiped and replaced and muttered and folded the dish towel on its seam. He watched her find a way not to be still. He could not find one for himself.

Alina stood by the window and looked into a courtyard where a cat was taking possession of a car hood. She said she would sleep on the couch if that was all right and his mother didn’t say yes or no, which meant yes. She said that in the morning she would go to the workshop, because there were things there that needed attention, tools that needed to be put away if they were never going to be used again, jobs that would have to be phoned and postponed and apologized for. She looked at Lukas when she said it and in her look was the question of whether he would come and the answer to the question of whether she would ask it again if he said no.

After midnight, when his mother had finally folded herself into the habit of sleep and Alina had stretched out with the blanket tucked up like a bandage, he walked home because the air had enough winter in it to make walking feel like thinking. Cologne moved around him in a tired choreography: drunk students hailing each other, a man in a reflective vest sweeping a drift of cigarette ends into a tidy valley, a dog discovering and rediscovering a scent as if it were news. He crossed near Barbarossaplatz and watched the arc of a tram wheel the way you watch a thing that doesn’t need you to watch it. He wanted someone to step out of a doorway and ask him for a light so that he could say, with reverence, I don’t smoke, I’ve never smoked, and be absolved of something smaller than what he needed.

In his flat, the dark had that layered quality that rooms have when something is wrong with the person in them. He turned on one lamp and then turned it off because it was too kind. The email was on the table where he had left it, the paper still bearing the soft crease of his pocket. He slid it under a magazine as if it were something a child should not see. He stood in the middle of his kitchen and waited for his body to tell him what to do and it did not. He rinsed a glass because rinsing a glass is an action, and poured water, and forgot to drink it. He took the tea towel and hung it over the chair back and then moved it because it creased wrong. He took the piano’s cover off and put it back on without touching a key.

When he finally lifted the fallboard and set his fingers down, the first note startled him with its honesty. He played it again just to see if it would be a different note, which of course it wasn’t. He found the shape of the chord he had put in “Fix You” that made him think of lanes after sleet, and the sound knifed through him with the precision of a well-made tool. He tried to sing and nothing came. He tried again and a sound came, thin and reedy and urgent, a voice he had never let anyone hear because who has the right to hear you unadorned. He sang a long vowel like a string pulled too taut, and it trembled in the room, bounced off the books, nested under the chair.

He thought of Jonas’s line, your mouth a cathedral people go inside, and something in him flinched away from the compliment as if it were hot metal. He sang an old lullaby, the one with little horses and a wind that moves through grass, and his mouth found the vowels as if they had been put in storage and left there too long. Halfway through, he realized he was not singing to Jonas, he was singing to the boy whose eyes had gone wide and then wider and then very close, and he pressed his forehead to the heel of his hand and stopped because if he went on he did not know what he would become.

Sleep came like the wrong train stopping at the platform. He took it anyway. When he woke, it was still dark enough that he could pretend there was time before morning, but the bells at Aposteln pushed their sound through the damp as if reminding the city to do its job. His phone had arranged itself into a constellation of messages. Annika wrote, tell me what you need, and he loved her for using the only sentence that felt like a door and not a wall. Seidel had sent the name of the defense lawyer, a man called Wolf who looked in his website photograph like a person who would move a glass an inch to make you uncomfortable. The producer had typed with the fervor of someone who believes work is a sacrament and then deleted half, because the last message ended with we can carry you and the carry somehow turned his stomach.

He showered and shaved because he could, as if proof of the possibility of ordinary tasks might anchor him to a world now missing a tooth. He put on a shirt and then another because the first one remembered another day. He took both off and put on a sweater that never fit him right and decided that discomfort was a fair penance. He went to his front door three times and didn’t leave the first two because of nothing anyone could see. On the third, he stepped onto the landing and let the building’s smell of old varnish flatten his lungs in a way that felt like a recipe. He took the stairs and was at the street before he knew what he had decided.

The workshop sat in a little side street in Ehrenfeld where graffiti negotiated treaties with advertisements and lost. Jonas had chosen the space because of the light and the rent and because the man he rented from wore a cap in summer and winter and told long stories about a band he had been in that never quite made it because they had once missed a train. The shutters were down as if sleep could be pulled like that. Alina met him with paper cups and exhaustion. She lifted the metal with that grip you use when you are using someone else’s strength through a handle. Inside, the air smelled of linseed oil and sawdust and the ghost of cigarettes, which no one had smoked in years and yet lived in wood like a memory embedded in the grain.

The table in the middle, the tilting one he had made for a girl who had left him for someone who read maps well, was there, cocked at that angle Jonas would insist was intentional. On the shelf, jars of screws sorted by size in a system only he could decipher. On the pegboard, tools hung like the idea of order. Lukas ran his hand along the edge of a plank as if greeting a dog. The line of it had that fidelity that wood has when someone cares. He found a scrap of paper with measurements in his brother’s neat slanted numbers, the eights like little spectacles. Behind the radio, as if he had hid public things for private fun, there was a sticky note that said in block capitals, LUK, DON'T TOUCH THE PLANER, and he laughed out loud because the absurd bossiness was the exact right pitch at the exact wrong hour.

There was also, in a paper bag on the counter with the name of a bakery he loved and mocked, a pastry that had become the opposite of itself, the glaze dull, the crumb stale. Alina lifted it as if it were an object in a museum that might teach them something. There was a receipt underneath for a bouquet scheduled for pickup at nine in the morning the day before, lilies and eucalyptus, a choice that would have been grand if it had not been so predictably Jonas. She set the paper on the table without comment and ran a finger along the border like a line she could cross if she could find a door.

“Tell me what you saw,” she said finally, and the courage in the sentence was a small animal. She did not say when. She did not say why. She did not say I need you to confess, which was both mercy and accusation. She looked at his face like a person who knows the terrain well and is trying to find a new path without leaving tracks. He held her gaze and found himself split, one person who wanted to pour all the words out until the room flooded, and another who had spent a life making words into bricks to build safe houses.

“I saw him stop,” he said, and it was a terrible sentence, sly and insufficient, and yet it was also true. He heard the sound his voice made in the big room and wanted to swallow it back. He added, because the absence needed a dress, “I saw how tired he was. He wanted things and he didn’t want them. He asked me to leave and he asked me to stay. He was always doing that. I wanted him to rest.” He didn’t look at her when he said, low enough that he could pretend he hadn’t, “I am so tired of wanting him to rest.”

She exhaled through her nose in the way she did when she had to buy time. She nodded, and the nod did not mean agreement and did not mean acceptance. It meant she had taken the sentence and put it on a shelf in her mind, and she would look at it later when daylight had pulled some of the color out of the edges. She said, “The police will ask again,” and he nodded and felt the nod in his neck like a hinge. She said, “They can tell, sometimes, with lungs,” and he heard biology arrive like an unsympathetic uncle. She said, “If I am called, I will tell the truth,” and he knew what the truth was because the truth has many garments and this was one of them. He said, “I know,” and he did, and he also thought: I have always wanted you to tell the truth, except for this once when I want you to protect me with silence like a quilt.

They worked till noon, which meant they moved things from one place to another and persuaded themselves that constituted meaning. A man came to ask about a shelf that was not ready, and Alina lied with a precision that made Lukas ache. She said there had been an accident, she said there would be a delay, she said she would let him know, and the man folded himself around the information as if around weather and left. On Jonas’s workbench, beneath a scattering of dowels and a battered pencil, there was a notebook. Inside, in a hand he did not show people, Jonas had written lists. Some were practical—PVA, 18mm, hinges—and some were the kind of lists you make when the world is too large: books he would read, towns he would see, what he would say to their father the next time their father said that making things was not making anything. On one page, in the corner, he had written, in a handwriting that was uncharacteristically careful as if he were learning to do it: Luk sings. Saturday. The underlining hurt more than it should have.

At two, the defense lawyer called, Wolf with his voice like a metronome. He said he could meet Lukas at four, in his office near the courthouse, wood and glass. He said not to bring anything and to leave his phone with a friend if he could because phones were traitors. He said to remember that silence is a right, and that grief makes terrible witnesses, and that this was going to be boring for long stretches and then very not boring for a few minutes and then boring again, which was the way with trouble.

At three, the producer called and he let it go to voicemail because the engineer in his chest could not take another wire. The message was a syrupy arrangement of sympathy and logistics. A car would be at his address at six if he wanted, and if not, the slot would be held dear, and if not, they would do a montage, and if not, they would send flowers to an address he preferred, and if not, they would be there when he was ready. Lukas listened to it twice because there was a note in the producer’s voice he could not place; later he realized it was greed strained through concern in exactly the proportions the job demanded. He put the phone face down and set a hammer on top of it because he was a man who had never before used a hammer as punctuation.

When he went to see Wolf, the office did have wood and glass, but the wood was modern and the glass made him feel like a ghost. Wolf wore a suit that whispered when he sat down, and he did not say he was sorry until the end of the meeting, which made the apology land with more dignity than the ones that had turned grief into currency. He asked questions and then asked them again a different way and then did not write down the answers because he had seen too many answers change color when ink touched them. He said that the hospital’s records would be a wall or a window depending on which way the light hit. He said that the mother who said she had seen nothing and the partner who said the monitors screamed and the lover who said he looked tired would all be read as truth-tellers unless one of them decided to tell a different truth. He asked about Jonas’s wish to die, and Lukas said there had been no sentences like that, but there had been sentences like, I hate this body, I hate being still. Wolf nodded as if noting the difference between a map and a photograph. He asked, and here he lifted his eyes like a test, whether Lukas had any reason to wish his brother harm beyond the reasons everyone has for everyone they love. Lukas thought of the shoebox, the shelf, the laugh, and he said, as if in court, “No,” and he hated how well he said it.

When he left, the winter light had gone thin and stung. He stood on the courthouse steps and watched a flock of birds act like a thought. He could have gone anywhere. He stood there and did nothing for a full two minutes in a way that would have felt like failure to earlier versions of himself. Then, because the body must move or turn to stone, he walked to the cathedral. He had not planned to. The feet did it. The square was a cold plane. There were tourists taking photographs and a woman with a violin playing with all her tendons. He went in through the side door because the side door had always seemed the honest door.

Inside, the dark had shape. The nave rose the way all human ideas of more rise. He slid into a pew and folded, not in prayer because he had never learned how to ride that particular machine, but in a posture that would be read as prayer by any passerby and therefore gave him cover. He breathed and thought of the nights he had sung under this roof, swallowing Latin coins. He thought of his boy mouth making perfect round vowels for adults who wanted to write heavens on their tongues. For a heart-stopping second, he almost walked to a priest in a little wooden box and pressed his mouth to a screen and allowed the one conversation in the world with a contract older and stronger than his, but he did not, because he knew he would say too much and the priest would be obligated to say nothing and the police would ask less gentle questions and the whole thing would become a liturgy of law with no music.

He sat until his back hurt in that exact place where the pew’s geometry intersected with human bone. He listened to a heater click on and thought of a winter when the heater had been broken and they had sung in coats and he had loved the way his breath made ghosts. He took his phone out and typed I will not sing on Saturday and deleted it and typed I will sing on Saturday and deleted it and typed I want to disappear and let the phone go dark. He reached for the bench’s groove where so many shoulders had worn the wood, and he felt how the wood had become a story of the pressure of men and women, and it made him want to cry in a way he did not know how.

When he emerged, the bells did their hour with their shiny surety. He stood in the square and let the sound roll over him until the square had emptied a little and he could breathe inside his coat. He thought of Jonas saying don’t turn me into—and then not saying the rest because pain had stolen his sentence structure. He thought of his brother asking him to go and then asking him to stay because that had been Jonas’s way always, to keep both doors open until the draft made everyone cold. He thought of the way his hands had turned into a fact. He thought of the line he had crossed, thin and made of words and thicker now and made of something like iron.

Back at his flat, the car the producer had sent waited exactly where the message said it would, a grey sedan that looked like all cars that wait. The driver stood with his hands behind his back and the posture of a man who had learned to be useful without letting anyone fall in love with him. He said, in a dialect not from Cologne, “Mr. Weitner?” and Lukas heard the shape of his own name like a question he had not yet answered. He stood on the pavement long enough for the driver to begin to look at his watch and then think better of it. The driver said they could make the nineteen twenty-six if traffic was kind. Lukas thought of trains with their bright, friendly interiors and the way stations allowed you to feel like you were going somewhere when you were only moving. He thought of a stage and a microphone and the bright stupid courage of a band ready to move with him. He thought of the machine that had learned to call his life a story.

He said, “No,” and then, because the driver deserved more than that, “I’m sorry. Not tonight.” The driver folded the apology into the part of his coat reserved for this category. He wished Lukas strength with a simplicity that made Luke wanted to tip him too much money and then remembered he did not carry cash anymore. The car pulled away with cinematic politeness. He stood in the small wind of its leaving and felt both abandoned and reprieved, which was ridiculous and exactly right.

Upstairs, Alina sat at his table with her hands around a mug that had not been warm for an hour. She looked at his face and read it because she was good at languages. She said, “Good,” and then, “I would have gone with you if you had gone,” and then, “I would have hated us for going.” He nodded and put his forehead to the doorframe, that childish posture of a person with a fever. She crossed the room without moving the chair and put her palm between his shoulders as if there were a switch there she could flip, and for a second he believed she could. He wanted to say I did something and then didn’t, because how many times could a person be brave in a day without breaking.

The night came again with its unoriginal threats and its promises of time. His mother called to ask when they would be allowed to see him again, meaning the body, meaning the boy in the bed who had turned into a set of decisions and a series of rooms. He said tomorrow, and he would go with her, and he would stand where she needed him to stand, and he would be her son while the state did its work. He said he would call the florist and tell them not to deliver to a workshop with no one in it, and he would ask if they could redirect bouquets because he knew the way grief made generosity bloom in unwieldy directions.

He slept a little and dreamed in those clipped, unambitious scenes that are color and smell rather than story. He woke with the taste of hospital air in his mouth and the phantom weight of a pillow in his hands and the knowledge that the next day would arrive even if he didn’t want it. He watched, from his window, a woman in a yellow coat solve her umbrella with determination. He sang, under his breath, a line that could have been anything. He made tea and did not spill the honey. He packed a clean shirt in a bag as if he were going somewhere, and he was, though it had no name. He listened to the street begin its rhythms and thought, with the particular clarity that comes after too little sleep, that there were two doors again and they would never stop being open at the same time. He understood that choosing one never closed the other; it only taught you how to live with a draft. He put on his coat and his shoes, and before he left he took the email out from under the magazine and folded it again until it was small enough to put in the ashtray he did not use. He touched a match to it and watched the paper blacken delicately, the words making their little bows as they curled. He waited until there was nothing left but the shape of the decision and a smell of sugar. Then he went to meet the morning that had not asked his permission.Morning arrived the way a tide does when you have not been watching the moon. It lapped at the city in its gray and ordinary way, lifted the pigeons off their ledges, wound the trams to their wires, knocked on windows with the knuckles of rain. Lukas dressed with the concentration of a man handling explosives, shirt buttons through holes as if threading a needle he couldn’t see. His mother called before he could leave and said she was ready, which meant she had been ready since before he woke, which meant she had not slept in any way that counted. Alina was already at the door, scarf looped twice, eyes with that bruised light around them that fatigue paints on the kind. They went down the stairs and the building smelled like someone frying onions and history, and he wished absurdly for his own kitchen’s smell of honey and tea to follow him and prove he belonged in one place more than another.

At Rechtsmedizin the air had a chill that did not belong to weather. It was the chill of rules and machines and people who have learned to speak in straight lines because anything else is a disservice. The woman at the desk wore a sweater too thin for the work and had a voice that placed commas where there should have been pauses. She spoke of identification as if it were an exercise. His mother gave her name and received a tag on a string and refused to put it around her neck like a visitor in a museum. They waited on chairs that were all the same color, aligned to a logic that made something inside him itch. A man with a newspaper flipped pages with care as if he was performing for a camera. Somewhere a metal door opened and closed with a sound like a book you’re not allowed to read.

When they were called, a doctor with tidily graying stubble and a mouth set by years of being the person who says the thing led them down a corridor lined with white tile in a pattern that felt like an argument. He spoke in words that cushioned and in words that did not. There was a double door, and then a room that had been dressed for the living as if to shame the purpose of the place: a table with a cloth, a vase with a single branch of something winter green, a chair with arms that invited you to hold on. “We do this,” the doctor said, and the “we” carried both the institution and a quiet, improbable tenderness. “We do this so that you don’t have to think about the other room when you think of him.”

It did not look like Jonas, which was the first mercy or the first cruelty depending on where you stood. They had arranged him the way people arrange the dead to be viewed by the living: hair combed as if to suggest an idea of his hair, mouth softened by the hand that had placed it in repose, the tubes gone, the lines he had carried half his life now deeper because everything had been drawn with a heavy pencil. His skin had that waxen surprise that means the person has vacated and left the furniture. His mother made a sound that was smaller than the one she had made before and therefore more dangerous. She stepped forward and then stopped and then put her hand on his forehead like a mother checking a fever. “So kalt,” she said, and then in their grandmother’s words, which kept her hands from shaking, “Du Dummerle, du warst immer ohne Mütze,” and if he had been alive he would have made a face at being called a fool and then laughed because she had called him that since he had walked into the rain without a hood at the age of eight.

Lukas stood and discovered that the body was a problem to be solved and there was no solution. He had always been able to make sense out of things by asking what they were for, how they fit, what they would do if you pressed here instead of there. He could not do that now. He watched his brother’s face and remembered the argument they had had at seventeen about who got to shower first before a party and how Jonas had put his head under the tap for two seconds and declared himself clean because time was something he wrestled not something he respected. He remembered him in the back yard with a beer he had been too proud to like and the sun making his eyelashes into filaments. He remembered all the times and none of them were this time and he wanted to roll them up and stuff them into this room until the room could not hold the now.

The doctor waited without impatience, which seemed like a gift. He said gentle things in a vocabulary he had invented since his first year when he discovered that Latin and German and bureaucracy were insufficient. He said that the formal procedures would be observed because that was how we knew we were living in a place with walls and not in a field. He said that any organs that might have been of use would have to wait because of the investigation, and his mother nodded as if that were a god’s decision and not a state’s. He said that someone would speak to them later today about belongings and papers and the part of the world where forms at last meet grief, and Lukas was grateful for the honesty because he had no room left for surprises.

They left with their coats not warmed by their bodies. In the foyer a woman argued softly on the phone about a permit and behind her a poster’s smiling face urged the citizens of North Rhine-Westphalia to think about the future in a font that was too cheerful. Outside, the sky had softened into a color that existed only between minutes. The air held that wet that gets into seams. His mother put her hand around his forearm with the pressure of someone stepping from stone to stone. “I will make soup,” she said, which sounded like a threat to fate, and then, because even she had to say it once, “He looked like your father.” The comparison sat on the steps between them like someone they did not want to introduce to each other.

On the pavement there was a photographer. The photographer pretended to be interested in the tiles as people exiting looked at him with the practiced glance that says I see you, you are not there. He raised his camera among the pigeons and the blur of the entrance and took a photo that would later be captioned with a sentence about tragedy and talent in a paper that liked to put two nouns together and see if sparks flew. Lukas saw the lens and felt nothing at first, and then the anger walked up his spine in its old shoes. He stepped toward the man with a speed that surprised him, and the man stepped back with a speed that did not. Alina touched his sleeve and said in a voice that threaded the needle, “Don’t give them a picture they can write on,” and he made himself stop because she was right and because the old rules still worked even in this city where the doors would not close.

At his mother’s kitchen, the rituals arranged themselves. He peeled potatoes badly because he always had, and she made approving noises as if his incompetence were a personality trait to be preserved. Alina cut leeks with a rhythm like a metronome, and the sound of the knife on the board held the room upright. They didn’t talk about the moment in the hospital because there was nothing to be gained by pouring that wine on the table yet. His mother spoke about the neighbor’s niece, who had had twins, and whether you should keep a basil plant in the kitchen in January when basil does not want you, and whether the priest from Sankt Agnes was still the one who made jokes that were almost good. Lukas said, “I don’t know,” and “I’ll ask,” and “I can call,” and he kept saying “I” as if it made any difference which of them did any of the doing.

The police called after lunch, the older officer with the neutral face and his first name turned into something official by the way it arrived through the receiver. He asked whether Lukas could come by in the afternoon for a formal interview. He said there were things the doctors had noted that the investigator would want to clarify. He said it as if speaking about weather again, but the note at the end of the sentence fell half a tone lower. Lukas said he would be there, and then he called Wolf, who said he would be there too, and would arrive five minutes early and stand in the hallway until someone asked him in because it was important to be invited to certain rooms.

The interview room had a table designed to be too large or too small depending on the number of chairs. It had a clock that pretended to be discreet and was not. It had a glass of water that had not been poured for him but was his. The detective introducing herself wore a cardigan that made a soft noise. She said her name and then said, “I’m sorry for your loss,” and he believed she meant it because she did not put any sugar on the sentence. Wolf sat to his left with his hands folded as if praying and asked at the beginning in his pleasant voice that they please remember to record and to let the recording announce itself in the way the law liked. They did, and the red light made its small point on the device like a star above a nativity scene, which was all he needed to have the absurd thought that justice was a religion with electronics.

The questions were not unreasonable. They asked about the accident again, and his answers fit in the places he had left for them. They asked about Jonas’s medical history, which, because the living do not keep thorough files on their bodies, he had to invent in parts. They asked whether Jonas had ever said he wanted to die, and he said that his brother had always wanted to be alive in a very loud way, even when he made it look like the opposite. Then the detective’s colleague, the younger one with hair from a shampoo commercial and eyes that had already forgotten their commercial, turned a page and asked, mindful and careful, whether Lukas had noticed any difficulty in his brother’s breathing before the monitors escalated. He said that breathing had been hard since the moment he had seen him because there had been a tube in his mouth and a machine doing the work, and that words and breath had been playing chess with each other and cheating.

The detective tilted her head in a move that was almost kind. She said the pathologist had noted signs that could occur in the course of critical care and could also occur when someone’s airway was compromised by an outside force. She listed them in vocabulary with damp edges: small hemorrhages in the eyes that could have happened in the crash and could have happened because someone had pressed where pressing is not supposed to be pressed, bruising that could have come from the collar of a seatbelt or the interaction with tubes and nursing or could have come from an attempt to comfort that had been too much, a pattern of hypoxia that could belong to trauma and could belong to intention. She said it would be irresponsible to rule one thing or another out yet. She said it in that voice people use when they are building the scaffolding for something they do not want to build.

Wolf’s hand moved once on the table and then was still. He said, in a sentence he had said so many times he had made a bed in it, that his client had been with his brother for hours and had watched machines and had held a hand and had called a nurse and had not done anything but be present. His tone placed the presence on a list of the most difficult acts a person can perform. The detective nodded and wrote something and then did not look at her colleague and asked, almost apologetically, whether the mother or partner had been in the room when the monitors sounded. Lukas felt his tongue go dry because here was the door through which any air might or might not enter. He said that his mother had gone to get tea and that his partner had stepped out to the bathroom and that he had been there, which was the truth, and he made himself keep his eyes on the detective’s pen because if he looked at the detective’s eyes he might mistake them for mercy and either tell more or not enough.

They let him go with the feeling a satellite must have when released into an orbit that has not yet been drawn. Wolf walked him down the hall and did not speak until they were past the second staircase and the fern that was dying in the corner from the same neglect every office fern endures. “They are doing their jobs,” he said, and the sentence was not meant to calm him because Wolf was not in that line of work. “Do not consult your conscience. Your conscience was not admitted to the room and will try to rewrite your notes. Speak to me before you speak to anyone else. I know you will not speak to journalists because you are not a fool, but do not speak to friends as if they are not also ears that the world can borrow.” Lukas said nothing because the only sentences he had begun in his head started with I and ended with words his profession despised.

On the way out, in the lobby near the poster of the smiling police chief shaking hands with a child who held a stuffed bear, he saw a man from a radio station he recognized by his ability to be in any room without being asked. The man raised an eyebrow as if asking whether there was a hallway they might step into where a microphone could be brought near Lukas’s mouth like a flower. Lukas looked at the ceiling and said in a voice that sounded like Wolf’s, “No comment,” and the man said, “Off the record?” with that little reckless grin that gets free things, and Lukas said, “Especially off the record,” and watched the man file that away as if it were a postcard.

He walked instead to the cathedral again because it had become the city’s lungs for him and he needed borrowed breath. He sat under the same arch he had sat under before and felt the same urge to walk into a booth with wood and a man and a curtain and a centuries-old promise of a thing called absolution. Over the hum of human voices and the heavy whisper of heat, someone rehearsed a psalm at the far end, the sound of vowels sent out like paper boats. He closed his eyes and saw the hospital pillow as if it had been carved into his eyelids. He opened them because there was nothing else that unstitched anything.

Annika called as he walked back, and her voice arrived like the piece of a song you forget you love. She said the firm had had ten calls from journalists with questions they would not answer and that Seidel had, against expectation, told people to go to hell with a tone that counted as injury-time loyalty. She said she had told a reporter who had tried to look like a mourner that all questions must be emailed and then had unplugged the phone in reception and had reduced the rest of the office to sign language for an hour because it was either that or break a stapler on someone’s head. She said that there were flowers in strange colors arriving addressed to him, and whether he wanted them at his flat or his mother’s, and he said, without meaning to sound foolish, “Neither,” and she laughed and said she would see whether anyone at a hospital could use lilies that were trying too hard.

The show’s producer wrote again, this time with fewer commas and less breath. He said the decision was still completely Lukas’s and that the slot was now listed officially as pending out of respect and that the judges were crafting words to say if he were to appear and different words to say if he were not and that, either way, his performance would be honored. He added, as if it were kindness, that if Lukas wanted to speak about his brother on air, it could be powerful, and Lukas typed “No,” and then deleted it because who needs to send a one-word email that looks like a door slammed, and instead typed, “I cannot speak,” and sent that because it was true in every tense.

Alina was at his flat with the lights low when he returned, and she had lit a candle, which he pretended not to notice because he had never learned how to treat candles as anything but props. She told him that the workshop had been visited by two men who had come to collect a table Jonas had promised by Wednesday, and she had given them back their deposit and watched one of them cry with embarrassment, which had made her want to hug him and also to correct the measurements on a drawing he had produced. She told him his mother had insisted on knowing whether the coffin would be wood or something modern, and when she had been told wood, she had asked what kind, and when told oak, she had asked whether it would be German oak, and when told yes, had nodded as if the state had finally done something right. She told him that she had been left a message by the younger policeman saying that a forensic specialist had questions about the mechanics of repositioning a patient and that she would return the call with the answer that she had not repositioned anyone and that, if necessary, she would say it in a room with wood and glass.

He sat on the floor with his back to the sofa instead of on the sofa because the floor did not lie about its hardness. He said he had nearly walked into a confessional, and she said she would have sat outside and waited, and he said the priest would have had to call someone, and she said perhaps some priests know when to be citizens, and he said no priest is trained for that, and she said you do not know all priests, and he said he did not know enough about anything. They permitted the silence to be a fourth person. The candle did its small translation of light into air. Outside, someone moved a recycling bin along the pavement like the onset of a parade.

His father called in the evening, which would have been a plot twist if their life were badly written. The number was still tagged in his phone as “Werkstatt Alt,” the old shop, because his father had refused to get a mobile plan with data and a name that announced itself as if it were a person. The voice that came through the line was a voice that had built rooms with its hands and could not abide things it could not hold. He said without preface, “Your mother told me,” and then, as if checking whether this was his line in a play, “How is she.” Lukas said she was making soup as if to pay a debt to the weather. His father grunted approval of both soup and weather. There was a pause in which you could hear the grit in the phone’s microphone. Then he said, “It was his leg,” and Lukas said, “And his chest,” and his father said, “He was stubborn,” and Lukas said, “He was,” and his father said, “You are more stubborn,” and Lukas considered that this might be affection in the only language his father had learned.

The conversation hung there, and then his father, daring something he had not dared in years, said, “Are you still singing,” and it was a question loaded like a ship. Lukas said, “Not tonight,” and his father said, “I would not have gone either,” and the admission was large because his father had always believed in doing the thing a man said he would do even if it broke the man. They did not speak about the hospital, because that was a room his father could not enter without breaking something he needed to use later. They spoke instead of wood because wood is a subject that allows men to say what they mean without the words noticing. His father told him about a stack of planks he had been sold that were supposed to be beech and were absolutely not and how you can tell if the tree grew on a slope by the way the grain refuses to straighten regardless of the plane, and Lukas listened with a gratitude that surprised him, because this, too, was a kind of prayer.

Sleep, when it came, did not sit. It prowled. He woke with his throat dry and the taste of the hospital like a memory that had not brushed its teeth. His hands did not have any new marks on them, which felt like a betrayal the body makes when it refuses to turn itself into a lesson. He went to the piano and set his fingers down and found that his hands could still find C without looking. He played scales because a scale is a promise the next note will make sense of the last one, and for seventeen minutes he allowed himself the trick. Then he played the chord he had put in “Fix You,” and he saw Jonas on the hospital bed, and he lifted his fingers and put the fallboard down as if closing were an act of decency.

The day smelled of damp paper and coffee. He had to go to the funeral home, because death insisted on its commerce. The man there was younger than him by a decade and had the eyes of someone who had become expert at adjusting his sympathy to suit any room. He spoke about options as if he were a tailor. He asked about music with the caution of someone who had already read the news and did not want to be seen to have read it. Alina took the lead with a steadiness that allowed Lukas to be the one who signed and not the one who decided, which was an inversion he would have apologized for in another decade. His mother insisted on the oak again and on a hymn that had too much tinsel in it for Lukas’s taste, and when he opened his mouth to say something, she cut the air with her hand and said, “You can sing whatever you like later,” which was the first time the word sing had been permitted to sit on the table that week and it made his pulse take a step he hadn’t asked it to.

At home there were flowers that had found them because flowers have a way of finding where they are not useful. The producer’s bouquet came with a card that said “With love, your X-Factor family,” which made him want to send it to the hospital and ask whether “family” could be recorded as next of kin. There was a wreath from the carpentry guild because Jonas paid his dues even when he hated dues, and it made his chest swell with a rage that had love tangled in it. There was a single sunflower that made no sense in January and therefore was perfect, with a note in a hand Lukas recognized from years ago: “For J., who stood in my kitchen and fixed a chair and then my face when I was twenty-one,” and he had to sit down because the past sometimes arrives like a tall person in a low doorway.

The show ran advertisements during the evening news with a montage of contestants laughing and crying in the way the machine had taught them, and a line at the end promised “the most emotional final ever,” which felt like an assault dressed as a dessert. He put the television on silent and watched people’s mouths make words that he had no interest in catching. He watched his own face appear in a shot he had forgotten from the first week, looking up from a piano with the look he had when Alina first put her hand on his neck and told him to breathe into the place under his collarbone. He watched the camera’s idea of him, and he wondered how a life divides into light and dark and which lens decides what gets to be seen.

He tried to imagine standing on that stage with his throat open and the lights making his eyes into coins. He tried to imagine saying Jonas’s name into a room that large with the microphones tuned to pick up tears and applause. He tried to imagine singing something other than the song he had arranged, because “Fix You” now felt like an ugly dare, and he flipped through possibilities in his head like cards in a bar game. There was Schubert and there was Brahms and there was Rio Reiser if he wanted to stay in his own tongue and there was a lullaby and there was the silence he could be bringing to an industry that knows how to schedule grief to the minute. He stood and walked and sat and did none of the things that lead to decisions.

At ten, the younger policeman called Alina and asked if she could come to the station in the morning for a statement. He used her first name with the care of someone stepping onto a frozen canal. She said she would be there and hung up and looked at Lukas in a way that felt like a pen left open on a wooden table. “I will tell them what I saw,” she said, and he said, “I know,” and they both sat with the knowledge like a hot stone you pass between palms so as not to get burned. She did not tell him what she had seen because the telling would be another thing that would not be able to be untold, and there were already too many of those in their week.

In the quiet that followed, he picked up his phone and typed a message to the producer and deleted it and typed another and deleted it and set the phone down and spoke to the room instead. He said, “If I sing, I do it the way I want,” and Alina said, “You should not sing,” and he said, “If I don’t, I won’t know who I am,” and she said, “You will not know who you are either way,” and he said, “Then it doesn’t matter,” and she said, “It matters in ways we will be discovering when we are seventy.” He laughed without joy and said, “We will be terrific at seventy,” and she said, “We will be insufferable,” and the laughter nicked the edge of the day and made it bleed less.

He did not sleep. He sat at the piano and did not play. He wrote his brother’s name on a piece of paper and then wrote it as they had written it when they were ten and twelve with a secret alphabet they had made under the table, and the childish geometry wrecked him. He thought about confession and repentance and the way people talk about wrongness like a machine you can crank backward if you find the right crank. He thought about crime and he thought about mercy and he thought about the courtroom that might be in his future and the stage that might be in his future and the fact that both have lights and that you wear different shoes to each. He thought of his father in the shop and of his mother with the soup and of Annika with her fortifications and of Wolf with his small smile and of the detective with her practical cardigan. He thought of Jonas laughing and he thought of Jonas asleep with his mouth slightly open in the hospital bed, and he put his head down on his arms and let the dark do what it does when you let it.

Morning lifted its pale hand. He dressed in a shirt he did not hate and a jacket that had survived three winters and one spring. He walked with Alina to the police station because she refused to go alone to rooms designed to find cracks in people. He sat in the waiting area and watched a man argue with a vending machine in a whisper as if not to wake anyone, and he wanted to take the man by the shoulders and say, “You will wake everyone,” and he wanted to hand him his own coin as a small terrible mercy. Alina did not look back as she went through the door because she knew if she did he would find a way to hold her and the room at the same time and that would be unfair to both.

When she came out, the look on her face was not a verdict. It was a landscape with clouds. They walked without speaking to the small park near the station where dogs taught themselves how to read and pigeons negotiated their treaties with crusts. She sat on a bench that had been dedicated to a man named Rolf who had “loved the Dom and his wife,” which was a line so good the city should have carved it on a stone. She said, “I told the truth,” and he said, “Of course,” and she said, “It was less dramatic than in my head,” and he said, “In your head is where drama is supposed to live.” She said that the detective had asked very specific questions about how the pillow had been, and he looked at the ground and she did not make him look up.

Afterward there was a call from the pathologist to Wolf, and Wolf relayed the call to him in phrases designed to be held in the hand. There would be no official conclusions today, there rarely were. There were indicators that needed to be read as part of a total picture. There was trauma from the accident that could not be separated neatly from the trauma of intervention. There were petechiae that were more than you would hope to find and less than a story that writes itself. There was a possibility like a note, held somewhere under the melody of it all, that someone would want to ask again about the way a pillow fits the world. Wolf said these things and then, at the end, with that unplaceable kindness he sometimes took out like a tool few saw, said, “We will go one day at a time,” and Lukas wanted to scream because he had always wanted to go one clause at a time, which is not the same comfort at all.

He turned toward the Dom as if the city itself were a compass. He walked through people who were looking down at their phones and people who were looking up at the gargoyles and people who were looking at each other because sometimes you get to do that. He went in and sat and closed his eyes and sang under his breath not a song but a note, the way a tuning fork gives you a letter and asks you to take it from there. The note hung and faded and lived under his tongue. He sang again, a little louder, because the space took what you gave it and returned it in a shape you hadn’t known it could have. He pictured a microphone and a stage and a cameraman with a cable as thick as a snake. He pictured a judge making a face designed to generate ten thousand clicks. He pictured a text from his mother saying, “We will meet the undertaker at three,” and he did not have to picture that because it arrived exactly then and he reached for the phone as if catching an object thrown at his head.

On the steps outside, a little boy with a balloon asked his mother how high the church was, and his mother said very, and the boy said higher than a dinosaur and she said probably, and Lukas thought that if there were a God interested in bargains, he would have accepted that as a prayer. He stood in the square and let the draft from the February doors run through him. He thought about two doors, as he always did. He thought that he had learned to stand between them not because he was brave but because he had never learned to close anything without breaking it. He looked at the sky, which had the exhausted color of old linen. Then he took his phone out and wrote to the producer a sentence that had sat in his mouth all morning: “If I come, I sing what I choose and there is nothing about my brother on air,” and he sent it and felt, for a ridiculous second, like a person who has told a lion to sit and has watched it consider.

The reply was faster than law would have allowed. It said yes. It said of course. It said we will adjust. It said we respect your boundaries, which was both very modern and very old. It said a car at six tomorrow would be at his building again. It said please rest. It said we are with you, and he resisted the need to write back that no one was with anyone, and that you can only sit next to, not inside, and that everything else was branding. He put the phone away and put his hands in his pockets and discovered a screw that had found its way there from Jonas’s shop, a small zinc-plated thing with a cross head. He held it between finger and thumb and imagined it doing the one small job it was designed to do and felt both comfort and fury break like weather over his head.

At home, Alina looked at him and the look made all additional sentences extraneous. He said, “I’m going,” and she said, “I know,” and he said, “I will sing the wrong song on purpose,” and she said, “You have always sung the wrong song on purpose,” and they laughed because this was a joke they had made before. He asked whether she would come, and she said she would if his mother could be made to agree, and he said his mother would never agree to bright lights while someone she had made lay in a room with fans, and Alina said then she would stay with his mother and they would watch badly and curse at commercials, and he put his hand on her shoulder and left it there until she brought her cheek to the back of his hand and breathed.

Night before departure was a list. He made sure his phone had charge because one does that now as if it were prayer beads. He put music in a folder as if folders had ever saved anyone. He put a shirt in a bag because shirts are how television forgives men their faces. He wrote his mother’s address on a piece of paper in case he needed to ask a driver to take him somewhere when speech took the long way around. He put the screw from his pocket on the table and looked at it as if it might take the hint and roll into the right place. He sat at the piano and took the fallboard up and did not play “Fix You.” He played something older, something with vowels that had survived empires. He sang “Der Mond ist aufgegangen” without any of the prettiness that choirs paste onto it, with the plain way country people must have sung it when they had nothing to rely on but each other’s voices, and he sang the line about the tired people and the sick people and the ones who mourn and he thought, with an honesty that felt indecent, the poet had no idea what he was talking about and had gotten it right anyway.

Sleep came grudgingly, gave him two hours and a dream of a train that never reached a station. Dawn would have been gray if it had not been colored by the knowledge of the day. He made coffee too strong and drank it as if it were medicine and then did the thing he had been postponing for eleven years: he opened the shoebox where he had kept every draft he had written since the night he and Jonas had put the first one in the yard by mistake or design. He took out the top one and it was awful, and he took out the next and it was earnest, and he took out the third and he saw the passage where he had found his own vowel for the first time. He put the third in his bag because he thought maybe if he had something he had made with his hands, he could stand on that stage and not be all throat.

A car would come at six the way modern chariots do, with a driver who had perfected the art of being a sentient cloak. He would go with a bag that was too small and a face that had learned how to stay still. He would go to Berlin, to the gleaming barn of an arena, to a backstage that smelled like hairspray and fear. He would find the piano and check the tuning with a man whose entire life was making strings behave in humidity. He would stand under the lights and not be able to see beyond the first row and would have to imagine a city of eyes. He would think about his brother and not say his name. He would sing a lullaby with no fireworks and hope that the machine did not eat it because it did not know how. He would then come home and stand in rooms with wood and glass and answer questions about the color of a pillow.

For an hour before the car came, he sat at his table with the screw between his fingers like a rosary bead and allowed himself the simple animal joy of delaying. The cats across the courtyard fought about nothing and then separated with theatrical dignity. Somewhere a neighbor’s radio played a 90s song with too much reverb. The bells at Aposteln told people what they already knew. He put the screw back in his pocket because it seemed wrong to leave it alone. He took his keys and the note with his mother’s address and the sheet of paper with the old arrangement and he stood up and he went to meet the car, which was waiting, as always, exactly where it had said it would be.The driver was the quiet kind who made himself into a hallway between places. He nodded when Lukas came down with his bag and did not offer a hand that might imply a need that had not been admitted. The city was doing its evening trick of pretending it had not rained by laying down a sheen that made every light into a coin. The sedan slid along the river for a stretch, the Rhine hanging there like a sullen piece of ribbon, and then cut through streets where the shop windows had decided to be generous and the people had decided to be small because weather teaches humility. Lukas watched the rails of the tram glisten and thought of how the city always looked as if it could be made new if only someone pushed.

At the station the hall breathed its big glass breath. Trains arrived with that courtly precision Germans like to call an apology and foreigners like to call a miracle. He had taken the ICE to Berlin often enough to know the choreography: the small rush to the platform, the little inventory of seats, the way the carriage settled into its running once the first fields went by. He sat by the window because he believed in the old superstition that if you watched a place leave, you could still belong to it. The seat opposite was empty until a woman took it with a bag full of knitting and the scent of wool, and he was grateful for the quiet industry of her needles because it told his mind to make smaller loops.

The train learned the country in its tilted way. Towns slid by with their names holding up letters like weathercocks. He didn’t read, because words arranged in rows made him think of the rows he had broken. He didn’t write, because any sentence he might construct would try too hard to carry weight. He watched instead the anemia of winter fields, the way lone trees made their case against sky, the flares of allotments with their stubborn flags. He thought, not for the first time, that time on a train was the only time he trusted, because it belonged to nobody even as it delivered you to the next obligation with ruthless kindness.

When the conductor came with his tilt of the head and his little machine, Lukas handed over his ticket with a politeness that made the man look up and search his face with the bewilderment people have when they recognize a face they have only met through pixels. The conductor said nothing and did not say good luck because luck would have been rude. In the café car a boy spilled Fanta and made of his apology a performance because being thirteen is a perpetual stage. An old man held a roll in his hand as if it were something that might escape. The knitter’s yarn made a sound like rain if you listened from far enough away. Lukas leaned his head on the glass and felt the carriage’s little shivers map his jaw like a stethoscope.

Berlin arrived as if dropped into the window by a hand: the sudden architecture that made different promises, the river wearing a different mood, the station an apparatus of levels and escalators like an exposition of progress. The driver on this side had the same posture and the same invisible smile. The studio lived in that part of the city where redevelopment had convinced itself it was an ideology; glass, steel, concrete with the corners left confident. A security man with an earpiece checked his name against a list, and the magic of a printed list let him in where good reasons often do not. It smelled inside like hairspray and coffee and electrical air. Somebody laughed too loudly because nerves make extroverts into weather.

Backstage was the organism he remembered: corridors wide enough to make you feel small, rooms labeled as if the labels could tame them, the sound of someone running down a hall with a headset and an apology. The producer met him with that theatre of empathy he had learned to read like a good book. The man’s hair had been distressed into plausibility, his eyes were bright with the joy of high-stakes logistics. He put his hand on Lukas’s arm with a weight that suggested intimacy and then removed it because they had agreed to boundaries. He said in a voice pitched to confide and include that they had adjusted the running order, that they respected his wishes entirely, that there would be no camera cutaways to a mother weeping or a friend wringing hands, that the judges had been briefed in language approved by three different people who made a living approving language.

“I brought the song,” Lukas said, and the producer’s eyebrows did a jump like a trick dog. “Not the one,” he added, and watched the small tremor of disappointment ripple and be suppressed with professional skill. “German,” he said, to spare the man from asking and risk making it sound like a challenge. “Old. Plain. Just piano.”

The producer nodded in the way of a person accepting something he could not sell but was willing to build a booth around anyway. He gestured toward a rehearsal room with a piano and a man in a black T-shirt who had tuned more pianos than most people have had dinners. The piano sat there with the patience of an animal that had seen it all. When Lukas put his fingers down, the sound rose with that complicated truth he loved: not as bright as a studio instrument, a touch of dryness that put the drama where it belonged, in the hands. He played the first phrase of the lullaby under his breath, the space doing that trick churches and large rooms do of making your breath into architecture.

There were other contestants in and out, their faces doing the thing faces do when they know they will be looked at by thousands and have learned to tolerate their own angles. A girl he had befriended in the second week with hair the color of a television apology pressed a bottle of water into his palm because hydration is solidarity when you have no other language. A duo in coordinated jackets warmed up in a corner with scales that sounded like elevators. Someone’s mother hugged someone too hard and said the non-specific things mothers say when they have no levers.

He ran the song twice, ignoring the part of his mouth that wanted to shape English vowels into the dark shape of a fix. He tried it once with the in-ear monitor and took it out because he needed the sound to travel the old way, to the air and back. He talked to the lighting designer, a woman with silver hair and a voice like a metronome, and asked her to make the stage small. She looked at him with the flat appreciation of a craftsperson and said she could shrink the universe to a lamp if he wanted. He said he did, and she showed him a cue sheet where blue would move to amber would move to almost nothing and he felt, for the first time since the hospital, the relief of a plan that did not try to save a life.

They gave him a dressing room that had a couch with the skin of something that had once been alive and a mirror surrounded by those round bulbs that make anyone think of theatre even if they have never been to any. There was a robe hanging on a hook that no one had ever worn on purpose. A stylist came in with a garment bag and a question that might as well have been a prayer: what are we making of you tonight. He shook his head and lifted his own shirt as if to say, let me be this man in his sweater, and she smiled with that particular fatigue of people who spend their days adjusting surfaces and occasionally get to be happy when a surface refuses to be polished. She ran a tiny brush over his cheekbones anyway because cameras are brutal and even grief deserves not to be made ugly by the wrong kind of light.

The host stopped in, all teeth and posture, with the kindness of a person who had built a career out of making everyone feel seen and then constructing ten seconds of that feeling into a segment. He said in a voice that had made grandmothers across the country nod at their televisions that they would not ask questions, they would only introduce him and step away, that his choice of song was brave and would be honored, that he could take as long as he needed between the end of the song and walking off because sometimes endings need the space to land. Lukas thanked him because he understood the geometry of generosity even when it was mapped over a machine.

Alina texted a photograph of his mother not watching the television yet, a bowl in front of her that might have been soup and might have been a symbol. The caption said nothing. The absence was a kindness. He sent back the picture of the piano because a piano is neutral and therefore safe to love. Annika sent a line that made him smile – Sing like they are just the two of us who got stuck in the file room – and a second line that threatened to break into a cheer if he let it. Seidel sent nothing because sometimes procedures are love. Wolf sent be calm, which was either a joke or an instruction he had ordered monogrammed on handkerchiefs, and Lukas put the phone face down and touched the screw in his pocket like a superstition.

Half an hour before broadcast the building tilted into that energy cities have when a storm is on its way. Monitors winked on. A woman with a clipboard did a last walk-through and spoke into her headset in a language composed entirely of verbs. Someone laughed at nothing because breath needs to escape somewhere. The band ran a chorus of a song that required more drums than sense. The audience came in like a tide, their coats shrinking them, their phones lifting their faces into little squares of light. The room learned their breath, and the breath learned the room, and he felt the old tremor in his legs that used to mean a good entrance back when being small and singing in Latin under a vault was the entire world.

He watched the first act from the wing with the particular attention that counts as protection, willing the young man with the nervous hands to nail the modulation, telling the woman with the high note that she did not need to step forward as if the sound could leave her without permission. The judges did their part with the rhetoric they had polished on planes and in cars: risk, journey, authenticity, growth. He wondered who had first said authenticity as if it were a skill and not a grace. He had the quiet thought that tonight he would carry his own authenticity like a piece of crockery across a crowded room.

When the stage manager touched his elbow, the touch was practical and blessed. He went to his mark into a light that had been made for him and knew what to do with. The first sight of the dark beyond the lights did what it always did: took away any sense of numbers. It could have been ten people. It could have been ten thousand. It could have been no one at all and the camera telling lies later. He sat at the piano and did the only thing he had always known how to do, which was to find middle C with his eyes closed and let his fingers find the door from there.

The cue light went green and then not, the host’s voice did its tablecloth trick and withdrew, and the first notes of the lullaby went out into a room that had been trained to hear in certain frequencies. He sang the first stanza with his head slightly down, the German carrying its own candlelight. He did not adorn, because nobody had asked for jewels. He did not slow, because sorrow has its own tempo if you let it. The line about the weary and the sick and those who weep laid itself in the center like bread. He kept the vowel on the word Nacht as round as truth. He did not think of hospitals for three and a half lines, and then he did, because the human brain is a hall full of unruly doors.

Somewhere in the second verse he felt what he had felt once at the Dom when his voice had floated a note into a place where architecture noticed and took it, when the word he made became a shape someone could look up at. The arena, ridiculous and made for noise, learned to be a nave for a minute. People stopped rustling as if an animal had entered and they did not want to startle it. He looked no one in the eye and therefore everyone. He did not tell a story and therefore told it. He let the last consonant sit down instead of stand on the chair, and the silence after was not the silence of a television show but the silence of a room filled with people who had recognized something old in a voice and did not want to move in case it stopped. He took a breath because his body had to. The lights did not ask for more.

The applause came the way applause comes when people are grateful for being returned to themselves for a second. It was not loud and it was not quiet; it was appropriate as weather is appropriate after a drought. He stood because he had to stand to leave, and his knee almost missed a line and he forgave it because he, too, was trying to remember the choreography of being a person. The host did not touch him and the judges did not say anything because they had been made to agree to that, and he smiled with the small upper lip smile you give a stranger offering you the last seat on a tram.

Backstage the sound broke back over him like surf. Someone grabbed his shoulders and then remembered not to. The girl with television-apology hair cried into her sleeve and then laughed at herself for doing it and asked him for the name of the song in a voice like a pocket. The producer said, “Thank you,” and it sounded like an invoice that had been paid and an apology for having sent it at all. The man in the black T-shirt put the cover down on the piano with a reverence that would have insulted a church. Lukas sat in his dressing room for the amount of time it takes for an adrenaline to learn it will not be paid again tonight and let his hands shake in the privacy they deserved.

His phone lost its mind in the way phones do when the world decides to pour itself into a single pocket. There were messages that were all vowels and those that were all punctuation. There were texts from numbers he did not know that had become less anonymous by becoming brief. Annika sent an obscene cheer and then a photograph of herself crying at the reception desk with the caption why is my face incompetent. His mother wrote, “Gut,” and nothing else, which was either the highest praise or a confession that she had been surprised by a song she already knew. Wolf sent a full stop, which is how some men sign their names. The producer sent a link to social numbers, which he did not click because numbers are not where he would find a place to lie down.

He went back to the wings because the show goes on even when you think you have emptied yourself. He clapped for the girl who used falsetto as a dare. He listened as the judges put sentences on top of one another until one of them stuck. He noticed a camera lingering on his profile and angled himself to offer it only the back of his head because the back of a head cannot be turned into a narrative as readily. When they announced that they would return after the break to the results, he remembered that the machine needed outcomes to justify its own moving parts and felt, for the first time that night, a cold in the sternum that had nothing to do with air-conditioning.

The host called the names and he stood where he was told to stand because obedience has its uses. The floor manager kept count with fingers at chest height, the way generals used to count lives. His name was not first and it did not need to be. His name was not second and he felt his stomach rehearse the particulars of rejection with the diligence of an intern. He came third into the trio who would go on, their breaths temporarily braided, their smiles borrowed, the cameras taking notes. He shook the hands he was given with the professional indifference of someone who had learned the eye contact you use to be gracious without becoming obligated. He did not think of Jonas for twenty breaths and then he did, which is to say he was alive.

Between live and live there is the corridor where time changes its clothes. A runner sent him toward a small room where a starch-faced man with a tie in the color of dishonest fruit handed him a paper about a charity partnership they would be mentioning on air and asked whether Lukas would mind holding a card at camera three and nod at the name of the sponsor. Lukas said he would hold whatever they wanted as long as he did not have to say any words and the man looked relieved because words are where the trouble starts. He held the card like a tray and thought about waiters and service and the way dignity arranges itself according to who gets to carry what.

In the final pass before the last singing, the producer leaned against the door with an ease he had purchased with years and said in a low tone that the network wanted him to close the show if he were to win because of the “moment” earlier. Lukas tilted his head as if listening to a language spoken in a country he had no plans to visit. “I won’t,” he said, not loudly, and watched the flicker across the man’s face of someone who has discovered his car has been keyed but has been given a packet of cigarettes by a stranger at the same time. The producer nodded and said they would make it work and it sounded as if he meant it, which was the troubling thing about the man; he usually did.

He sang the lullaby again when asked, because the machine likes a motif, and hated it for a second for allowing itself to be used, and forgave it, because songs do not choose the mouths they arrive in. This time he let a breath out a fraction earlier in the second verse and nobody died. This time he let himself look once into the black beyond the lights and pretended he could see a boy with bicycle knees and a grudge against seat belts sitting in the cheap seats, and he pretended the boy rolled his eyes and clapped in the wrong place and whistled between fingers he had learned to make into instruments. He did not bow. He stepped away.

He did not win. He did not lose either, not in the way the show made losing look like a birthday party where someone else has been handed your cake. The duo in coordinated jackets took the trophy in a flurry of confetti that had been scheduled for them no matter what happened to the music. The host made a speech about journeys and the public and the nation gathered together on a winter night, and the camera found the faces it had already chosen to like because liking is an algorithm now and people confuse it for love. Lukas clapped and did the almost-smile again and felt, underneath the static of relief and the soft teeth of not-quite-disappointment, a stillness that was not calm so much as an empty room where something could be built later if anyone knew how.

In the dressing room after the light had been packed into vans and the audience had been poured back into winter and the crew had begun their complicated ballet of leaving, he sat with his coat on because he did not want to be naked under the kind of light that knows too much. The girl with apology hair knocked once and did not come in because she had learned boundaries in a month much as people learn languages in a year-long course abroad. He texted Alina, who wrote that his mother had cried once and then forbade herself and then allowed herself again because rules break eventually, and that she had liked the German because it didn’t make her feel like she was on a ferry. He told them he would be on the earliest train and meant it like a promise and an anchor.

On the way out, the corridor was already beginning to forget him, as rooms do when you leave them. The lighting woman with silver hair shook his hand with the satisfaction of a carpenter whose joint has held. The man with the piano gave him a look men give men whose hands they respect, which is to say a nod and a half-smile that has more in it than words. The producer found him by the loading dock where the cold came in through a rectangle and asked him, because he could not help himself, whether he would consider a recorded message for the show’s online channels in which he spoke about the power of song to heal. Lukas met his eye and said he did not trust healing tonight and the man, to his credit, bowed his head literally a fraction as if to accept church into the room and said he would not press.

He slept in a hotel that had decided to be minimalist because luxury had embarrassed it in the early 2000s. The bed was a piece of geometry. The minibar was a lesson in despair. He lay on his back and watched the ceiling make its case for wholeness and did not dream because his body had collapsed the border patrol for the night. At five he woke not because he had slept enough but because sleep had done what it could and refused to argue. He showered until the water changed key. He left the screw on the nightstand and picked it up again because you do not leave your amulets behind in unfamiliar rooms.

On the train back he sat in a carriage with families who had been to museums and people who had been to hospitals and people who had been to nobody and had used the weekend to remind themselves of the shape of a mouth. He woke twice when the train slowed for reasons it did not care to share. He drank coffee that had been made by a machine that believed in the idea of coffee more than its practice, and he was grateful anyway. He read the same paragraph of a newspaper article three times and could not tell you which war it had been about. He thought of how swiftly the machine had made last night into content, and of how the city to which he was returning had not moved at all in the one way that mattered.

Cologne in morning looked like a person who had washed their face and not yet decided which expression to put on. Alina met him at the station with the kind of hug you give in the shadow of a large public clock. They shared a paper bag of pretzels because salt is a kind of forgiveness. She told him the undertaker wanted to see them at noon and that his mother had had an argument with the parish secretary about whether the coffin could be in the church overnight or whether the rules were rules, and that the secretary had said rules were rules and his mother had said that rules are humans being scared of God, and he did not have the strength to choose a side and so he nodded.

The apartment smelled of basil despite the rules of seasons because a neighbor had left a pot on the doorstep with a note that said in lopsided type, “You need something alive,” and his mother had brought it in with suspicion and watered it with disdain, and the basil had, perversely, perked up. They sat at her table with its laminated veneer that had seen every year of their lives and had refused to curl, and he told her about Berlin in the smallest possible words and she told him about a woman from church who had brought a cake that looked like a hat. They did not say the word pillow. They did not say the word law. They did not say the word mercy. They said the names of vegetables and men who had made them angry in the 90s and the time of the appointment.

Wolf called while he was watching a pigeon teach another pigeon about the geometry of the balcony railing. The lawyer’s voice was as neutral as a coat hung on a hook. He said the pathologist had added questions to his earlier list and that those questions would be formed into sentences by the detective later in the day. He said there was talk of an interim report that would not be interim to the newspapers, and there was talk of a prosecutor who enjoyed certain kinds of puzzles more than others. He said he would be at the station at four and would like Lukas there at four as well, and that Lukas needn’t say more than he had said the last time, and that Alina had been clear and did not require a second interview yet.

He walked the long way to the undertaker because the long way gave his nerves a place to go. On the corner near the kiosk where they once bought magazines for airplane days, a man was arguing with a scratch-off ticket like a philosopher. A boy on a scooter found the one strip of dry pavement and rode it as if it had been laid for him. In the window of the Turkish bakery there were simit impossible to name in a language that had never learned the pleasure of sesame. He stopped and bought two and ate one standing up because standing is sometimes the only thing that holds you together.

At the undertaker’s, the man in the good suit laid out options as if testing whether grief would choose the expensive wood on principle. His mother wanted oak as she had wanted before, and he let her have oak because refusing would break a mechanism he could not fix. He chose a simple spray of green that would not try to sing louder than the song. He said yes to a printed program only because he wanted names to be spelled correctly in the place where they would be held in people’s hands. When the man explained the route from church to crematorium, his mother interrupted and said no, we are not doing any of that. He watched the undertaker learn a new kind of respect.

At four, the station was the same as ever, which was its threat. The detective with the cardigan had added a scarf that declared itself to be red without apology. She gave him tea in a paper cup and asked him about sleep in a tone that was more human than her earlier tone and therefore more dangerous. Wolf folded his hands and unfurled them and made a little note on a card without writing anything down. The detective asked about pillows as objects, about whether he had touched one, about whether he had helped adjust a patient when the nurses were not present. He said he had smoothed a sheet because it had made mountains and he had always hated untidiness, more than was good for him, his mother would tell you, and the detective wrote that down because humor makes bodies move.

When he went home, the kitchen light made an island against the evening. Alina had moved the basil to the sill and it looked ridiculous and brave. His mother had set the blue sweater on the chair and it had become a member of the household. The evening news had a segment about a body found in the river not far away and a segment about someone winning a game worth millions and a segment about last night’s show in which the host’s hair had the same posture it had had in person and Lukas’s song was called brave again in a voice that had been pitched to sell to advertisers. He switched the television off with the same finger he had pressed on a pillow and recoiled from his own coincidence.

After dinner he sat at the piano and did not call up last night. He played the tune his father had taught him once, a ham-fisted version of Lili Marleen that had been the only bridge between them some months and he laughed a little at the way muscle memory humiliates mind. He sang under his breath and replaced words with vowels because lyrics would have tied the hands of the song. Alina sat on the floor with her back against the couch because that was her preferred angle and asked him questions about Berlin’s backstage bathrooms because sometimes you ask about plumbing to keep from drowning.

He slept; he dreamed something with doors that did not shut and bells that did not ring and a river that had been replaced by a road. He woke and wondered briefly whether he had been a different person in the night and decided that he had not, which was both a blessing and a punishment. He made tea and did not spill the honey, and when the kettle clicked, he thought of the first morning and of how many lives had been lived since by people in a ten-kilometer radius. He touched the screw in his pocket and threw it on the counter in irritation with himself for having a relic, and then he picked it up again because irritating yourself is sometimes how you measure still being there.

The next day the church opened its side door because side doors are always for those who can’t bear grand entrances. The sexton, who had known him since puberty taught his voice to misbehave, nodded toward the transept with the deference that belongs to the mother of the dead and her retinue. They set the time and the place in words that made his mouth dry. He asked the organist, a thin man with gentle hands and an allergy to complication, whether he might have the keys for an hour when there was nobody in the nave. The man looked at him for the length of a long rest and then took a ring from his pocket and spun it like an idea and handed it over. The keys were old. They understood doorways as an art.

He sat at the organ because sometimes arrogance is the only way forward and pulled stops he had loved when he was a boy because they made the kind of sound that wrote its own city on the air. He did not play something grand. He took a chorale and made it small on purpose, because you can talk to God in a whisper if you think he lives in the rafters. He liked the muscle of the instrument under his hands, the way air made a case for itself through the lungs of wood and pipe. He played a line that would never make it into the order of service and allowed himself to imagine that nobody heard, and in that permission, he heard exactly what he needed to imagine.

The call from the prosecutor came in the afternoon not because the state wished to be cruel but because it had learned the trick of inserting itself into times that people believe belong to them. He would be required, the voice said, to appear the following day with his counsel for a formal statement under caution. It was a sentence he had heard in English in the media and never imagined in German with his name at the end like a theorem. Wolf took the other line in a motor of words that said all the necessary objects like rights and procedure and schedule and adjournment and demonstrated, by his tone, that the house would not fall yet. Lukas leaned against the sink and felt a small stone begin to roll in his chest.

Night fell in the ungenerous way February brings to a place that believes in light. He went downstairs to put out the trash because trash is a contract between you and your city and, if you keep it, some things keep you. He saw through a window across the courtyard a man teaching a girl how to slice an onion and wanted to knock on their door and ask whether he might be permitted to stand in a corner and watch for a minute because ordinary gestures had become a religion. At his own window, the basil looked ridiculous again and again brave. He watered it because believing a plant will live is an act of defiance.

He lay in bed and could not stand the idea of sleep and could not stand the idea of being awake. He thought about sentences and their ability to heal and harm. He thought about names not spoken aloud because mouth-shape would make them too present. He thought about whether the song had made any difference to anything but the digital appetite of the machine and decided that it had made a small, indecent difference to him and that this would have to be enough. He thought about the pillow and his hand and the silence afterward and felt the kind of pain that refuses to be labelled so that you cannot begin to bargain with it.

Morning arrived as if it had been told not to and had come anyway. The bells admitted that the hour existed. He drank coffee that wanted to be an apology for a universe it could not fix. He put on a shirt and a jacket that had stopped pretending to be new. He placed the screw on the table and left it there because carrying it now felt like a vanity. He kissed his mother’s temple in the doorway and took Alina’s breath with him like a borrowed scarf and went to meet a day that would insist again on its rituals: wood and glass and questions, a church with its hard-backed mercy, a city that kept breathing because breathing is what cities do when people cannot. He turned the key in the lock the way one plays the first note of a song and hoped, absurdly, for an arrangement he had not yet written that would allow all the doors to hang in air without making a draft.The morning of the statement came dressed like any other February, a gray that didn’t bother to be a mood. He stood in his kitchen and watched the kettle perform its routine with a seriousness that made him want to laugh or cry. He stirred honey into the tea without spilling and looked at his own hands as if the steadiness were new and therefore suspect. The basil on the sill had remembered that plants go toward light without needing to call anyone about it. Alina moved around the room with the low hum of someone who had slept in pieces and gathered herself between them. She asked him if he wanted toast and he said no and took it when she put it in front of him because appetite is not a democracy. In the next room, his mother made the noises of a woman preparing to put on a coat, the zipper’s small negotiation with metal, the throat-clearing that asks the air to be polite.

He chose a jacket that didn’t mean more than cloth. He left the screw on the table and told himself that walking out without a talisman was an act of adulthood and not an invitation to fall. His phone vibrated with its familiar evangelism: Annika asking for updates in a sentence so stripped of adjectives it made him love her, the producer with a link he did not open and a heart he did not want, Wolf with a time and a map pinned to his message like a compass that did not trust anyone who wore compasses on ties. He wrote to his father and deleted it because he could not find a sentence that began without debt. He wrote to his mother’s neighbor about the keys to the workshop and did not send that either, because he could not imagine a stranger’s hands on Jonas’s tools even if they were only hands, even if all hands were only hands.

On the tram, people performed their morning rituals as if to keep civilization from slipping. A boy solved a math problem with his tongue clamped between his teeth, a woman tied her scarf as if teaching a class, an old man arranged his shopping list like a poem that only he could read. When an announcement came about a delay two stops ahead, everyone lifted their eyes with the same expression—the one that says, yes, of course, we live in a world where things happen—and then angled them back to small screens where weather maps pretended to be news. Alina stood close enough for her coat to brush his sleeve every time the car lurched and that brush built a bridge he walked back and forth across without needing to say he was.

Wolf waited under the police station’s coat of arms like a man who had learned how to be architecture. He nodded at them, a nod calibrated to include and to warn. In the hallway that always smelled like paper and patience, he summoned his quiet brief speech, that piece of legal liturgy designed to put ribs back around lungs. He told Lukas again about rights as if rights were furniture, practical, necessary, possible to sit on when the floor gave. He told him about the difference between telling and being told, between narrative and interrogation, between the truth you hold and the truth you hand over. His voice never rose. When he finished, he touched the back of a chair with two fingers as if to put the word wood in the room.

The detective with the cardigan had put on another scarf, this one the color of cherries that arrived in July and pretended to have survived the trip, and the red made her look less like a rule and more like a person on a tram. She gave her name again as if the first time had been in a different century. She poured tea into paper cups because paper softens a little even when everything else wants to sharpen. The recorder announced itself with a square of red like an apology for eavesdropping. The script arrived in tidy clauses: you are not obliged, you may consult, you may withdraw consent, you may speak, you may not, the door is a door. He said his name and the address his mouth always trusted and kept the rest of the words inside him, where words sometimes do less harm.

The first questions were administrative, the formalities that trick you into thinking all questions can be solved by lists. They asked for the times he arrived and left the hospital; he could provide the edges and then felt the middle go fluid, like soup that refuses to thicken. They asked who was in the room, and he listed them—nurses with faces he would recognize in any city, the doctor with careful hair, Alina, his mother, himself—in a cadence that almost made him believe enumeration could lead to absolution. When the detective’s colleague said the word pillow, he watched Wolf’s hand twitch and then still. The detective did not say the word again. She talked instead about repositioning patients and about the things family members do to be useful and sometimes are, about the way grief reaches for products and processes when the problem is not soluble.

He said he had smoothed a sheet because it had been bothering him since he was six that fabric sometimes looks like a landscape you cannot travel. He said he had moved a tube aside because he could not bear the thought of it pulling, of pain arriving by way of something easy to fix. He said nothing about pressure because the room already held more than it could breathe. He kept his answers correct and incomplete. He watched the detective mark something in her mind and not on paper. Wolf’s silence had a temperature. It made the air feel like a bowl you were not allowed to touch even if you wanted to know whether it rang.

They asked about Jonas’s drinking and he said two or three as if numbers were a rope across a ravine. They asked about Jonas’s words and he repeated the ones that felt like coins legal tender in any court: hurt, tired, stupid, fine, later. They did not ask about mercy because mercy is not a word cops can use in rooms with glass. They did not ask whether Jonas had asked for what some men call help and some men call murder, because everyone in the room had attended enough funerals to know sentences like that wear out their shoes fast. The detective talked about the pathologist’s language—could and might and suggests and not inconsistent with—words that make scaffolding and not buildings. Lukas nodded as if nodding were part of a plan.

When it was over for now—because in rooms like this nothing is ever over, it is only paused—the detective did the thing decent people do. She said she was sorry in a voice that didn’t pretend to carry anything it couldn’t. She asked him to come back when the interim became not interim, when the report learned to be conclusive, when the law put on its suit and shined its shoes. Wolf stood and his chair gave up its small sigh. In the corridor, a machine that sold chocolate declared itself temporarily out of order and he wanted to applaud it for its honesty. The fluorescent lights hummed the note you find in some train stations and in teeth that need a dentist. He felt the old draft he’d learned to recognize move through him; two doors open again, air insisting on being air.

Outside, rain made the city’s edges soft. On the corner, a man with a dog refused to let a car push him into a puddle, and his small rebellion saved nobody and was still perfect. Alina walked beside him without asking what he had not said and in her not-asking was a solidarity he blessed under his breath. They stopped at the kiosk where they had bought magazines for airplanes and misery, and he bought a pack of chewing gum because it was a child’s defense against a grown-up day. The woman at the counter looked at him for a second too long and then looked away and pushed his change across as if the coins were a bridge neither of them had learned to cross.

His mother had made a pot of vegetable soup as if vegetables could be arranged into a sentence that meant we will not die of this. She set bowls down with the assurance of someone who had discovered that action was the only antidote the body permits. She asked how it went in the tone of someone asking whether the train had run on time, as if schedules could stand in for ethics. He said they asked and we answered and added the word later, which had become a habit and a prayer. She ladled him a second portion before he could finish the first, because abundance is sometimes the only tool left in the drawer.

The afternoon was dedicated to errands that pretended to be holy. The parish office needed to know about readers and flowers, the undertaker wanted to confirm the route like a man ordering parts for an engine, the choir director left a message that sounded like a request and an apology for the request at the same time. He met the organist again and this time asked, with all the precision he had left, whether there could be a moment inside the service that wasn’t a performance. The organist’s face did a soft thing men’s faces sometimes do when their professional hardness allows for a small mercy; he said there is always a moment, Lukas, and if there isn’t, we make one.

Annika came by with a bag of groceries that contained nothing you could use to make soup and everything you might use to feel like a person—a loaf that had ambitions, chocolate in foil that sounded like laughter, three lemons as if to remind the room that brightness still exists. She brought paper from the office because offices insist on being present even in kitchens, and he signed where she told him to sign because bureaucracy is comfort when you know which line is yours. She stood in his doorway as if making sure the light was still working and told him that Seidel had frightened a journalist by looking at him with a blank that had taken twenty years to perfect. She told him that his desk had become a postbox for cards addressed to a building by people who had seen a face on a screen and decided to feel something with a pen.

In the evening, his father called and said the thing he could say. He said he had planed a length of oak so clean it looked like language. He said that if Lukas wanted a piece for the coffin, he could bring it and nobody would have to know except the wood. He didn’t say, of course, that he had thought of the law and found it insufficient in both directions. He didn’t say, of course, that he had thought of Jonas and the two of them at a kitchen table with a broken radio between them and how their hands had learned to be useful before they learned to be kind. He talked about grain and about how you can tell which way the tree wanted to go before the blade told it otherwise. Lukas leaned against the fridge and let the sound of his father’s voice be a river he didn’t have to cross.

He went to the workshop after dinner because the smell of glue and oil had always been a better therapist than most paid ones. Ehrenfeld was in the mood it got when the weather remembered it could be ugly, the graffiti sulking, the cafés bulking in on themselves with steam, bicycles looking abandoned rather than parked. The shutter went up with the muscle memory of someone who thought they were still part of this routine. Inside, the table in the middle gave him its listing look and he gave it the courtesy of pretending not to notice. He ran his hand along the plank he had touched the last time and thought again about surfaces and what they can hold.

On the bench, under the notebook that had broken him earlier, there was a small parcel wrapped in brown paper with his name on it in Jonas’s deliberate block letters that he used when he wanted to be certain the world wouldn’t mistake him. He stood looking at it for a childish, superstitious minute because opening something with his name on it that had been written by hands that would never write again felt like a line only terrible people crossed without breath. He opened it anyway, because some lines exist to be walked across by the living. Inside there was a handle for a plane, carved out of off-cut walnut, sanded to an indecent smoothness, the kind of object that makes you think you understand the person who made it better than you do. Underneath it, a card with the kind of joke Jonas made when he wanted to be tender without catching himself at it: for when you finally make something with your hands, Luk, and want it to be more than a file.

He sat on the stool and put his face in his hands for a minute that taught him something about how long a minute can be. When he lifted his head, the room had not changed. The radio in the corner refused to find a station, as if static were all you deserved today. He put the handle in his pocket because you do not leave your name on a table in a room anyone can enter. He wiped sawdust where sawdust did not need to be wiped because tidiness is worship if you do it right. He closed the notebook and made it square on the bench because he could not pretend anymore that the edges would save anyone.

The funeral day approached without theatrics. It announced itself in the way schedules do when someone has given them the dignity of being followed. The sexton showed him where the pallbearers would stand. The florist argued with the florist she carried inside her head and won, which was a relief because the arrangements didn’t look like a wedding and didn’t look like an apology. He checked the lectern for height not because of anything practical but because he wanted to be able to control one single variable that day. Alina and his mother took on lists like generals distributing soldiers along a line. The soup pot in his mother’s kitchen earned a brief rest. The basil continued to insist on its own silly life.

The prosecutor’s office asked for them again the afternoon before the service. The phrase used in the message was not inappropriate and not urgent and somehow made him feel both accused and forgiven in the space of a breath. Wolf said it would be the same room and a different game and that they should prepare for everything and expect only this: that the room would hold them even if the people did not. The detective had added a pair of glasses today that made her look like a person you would trust with a recipe and a secret. The recorder clicked again. The prosecutor this time, a woman with a jaw that looked like it had read the civil code for fun in university, asked the questions herself and folded the words careful and reckless together in a way that left marks.

They spoke about the autopsy as if it were weather you had to bring a coat for. The pathologist had found what he had found—petechiae like punctuation, bruising like someone had written a sentence and then erased only to find the paper remembers, a pattern of oxygen and its absence that belonged to crash and to care and to hands. She said the phrase nicht auszuschließen with the kind of care you use with a hot pan. She said that there would be experts and counter-experts if it came to that—men and women who made it their profession to make breath into argument. Wolf said they did not need to make those men today. Wolf said his client would exercise his right at this stage to say nothing beyond what he had said, not out of disrespect for the process but because process was all they had and process deserved to be respected properly, with time and with exactness.

Afterward, on the steps, someone called his name in the way strangers do when they believe they are owed a piece of you because you have allowed your face onto their table. A woman with a microphone walked toward him with her smile held up like a flag. Her hair had been convinced by a team to withstand weather and law. She asked whether he believed music had the power to heal and then, unable to stop herself because hunger is a tool of that trade, whether he had anything to say about rumors. Wolf stepped into the frame as if born to it and spoke the sentence he had built from long practice—no comment, we respect the ongoing inquiry, we ask for respect in return—and the woman took her trophy of footage and left. Lukas watched her go and understood, for a second, the geometry of pity.

Night before the funeral the apartment collected people it had known for years. The neighbors came with food and awkwardness, with beer they set down as if expecting it to explode. The priest from Sankt Agnes came with a joke that was almost good and with eyes that belonged to his other vocation, the one where he sat in a wooden box and learned to be a safe for sorrow. He did not make the mistake of offering absolution to anyone who had not asked. He spoke about temperatures and candles, about the order of the service, about the way grief always tries to take over and must be allowed to as long as it leaves the room standing. He asked whether there would be music beyond the listed hymns, and Lukas said there would be a small something and the priest nodded as if small were the holiness he’d always argued for in rooms that wanted grand.

He slept badly for reasons that had nothing to do with sleep and everything to do with sound. He woke at four to the bells being kind for once, a soft counting that did not insist. He went to the kitchen and found his mother there already, her sweater making her look like a general in the army of survivors. They did not speak about the day. They spoke about bread and about whether basil could be persuaded to live one more week without sun. He took the parcel with the walnut handle from his pocket and placed it on the table and watched her face alter as she picked up the wood and felt what it does to the hand when the person who made it loved the hand it would belong to.

The church was cold the way churches are when they remember they were built out of stone and ideas. The coffin sat there like a statement, oak with its own dignity, the pall that said ritual over it like an old law. He slipped into the side pew and looked up because there is nothing else to do if you do not want to stare at a box. The organist played people in with the modesty of a person who knows the instrument is a wind inside a wall. The altar boys performed their choreography with that severe sweetness that belongs only to children in borrowed robes. The priest did not rush and did not lag. He spoke Jonas’s name at the beginning and again in the middle and again near the end with the frequency a name needs to earn its place in a day.

Lukas stood when it was time to read and almost said no because standing made his legs part of the story. He read from Ecclesiastes because the old words have the decency to be worn and therefore not arrogant. He said there is a time to break down and a time to build up and thought of the workshop and had to swallow twice before the word laugh would let itself be pronounced. His mother did not cry when expected to because her body had always refused to be told what to do by anyone. She cried when the priest fumbled a page and murmured Entschuldigung into his microphone, and her laughter came out as a sob that made five old ladies turn their heads as if a bird had flown into the nave.

When it was time for the small something, he did not walk to the front. He stayed where he was, at the side, where the arrangement of chairs had left a margin. He sang the lullaby he had sung in Berlin but not as if it belonged to any stage. He sang it under his breath and let the air carry it along the transept like a rumor about kindness. The organist did not try to find him and accompany him and in that restraint was a professionalism that made Lukas want to send him wine every winter for the rest of his life. The note on Nacht held for the exact length of one person’s ability to stand and then sat down. He felt no healing, because healing is not a performance either. He felt only that he had put a sound into a world that had taken one out, and that arithmetic would have to do for today.

After the service, hands. There are always hands. Hands that had known him his whole life, hands that thought they knew him now, hands that wanted to be forgiven for not knowing what to say and tried to do it through pressure. He let them and did not. A man from the carpentry guild pulled him into a hug that smelled like varnish and said your brother owed me fifty euros and I will never forgive him for not paying, and then cried into Lukas’s shoulder with a dignity that would have impressed an archangel. The girl Jonas had once made the tilting table for came with her hair cut shorter and her shame longer and said he was impossible, and Lukas said yes, and she laughed and said thank you like the word had been put on a plate for her and she had been allowed to take it home.

By evening the apartment was quiet, the basil had drooped a little from overattention, the blue sweater had been put carefully away because superstition demands of us small cruelties. He sat on the floor with his back against the couch and the walnut handle in his hand and watched the light fail in the way lights fail in midwinter: politely, knowing we have candles if we insist and darkness if we don’t. Alina stretched out with her head on his thigh and did not ask what he would say tomorrow because there were no tomorrows left that could be surprised by his answer. His phone lay face down on the table because it needed to understand its place. The screw he had left there glinted under the lamp like something that had decided to be useful no matter what story you tried to write for it.

The next morning the prosecutor’s letter learned to wear urgency. Wolf read it in a voice that refused to put drama on paper. The interim had become less interim. The pathologist had moved a clause from one paragraph to another and by doing so moved weight. The word homicide did not arrive because German prefers its own shapes, but the idea took a chair anyway. The detective asked them to come at noon, and noon felt like a choice and not. In the hour before, Lukas went to the Dom because it had become his punctuation mark between statements. He sat under the same arch that had allowed him to practice not praying and allowed him to continue. He listened to the heater and the people and the way foreign languages behave under high ceilings.

He thought of the pillow in the way a man thinks of a bridge he has burned; as an object with physics, as a decision with heat, as a kindness with teeth. He did not rehearse sentences because rehearsing would make them pretty and law hates beauty unless it can be cited. He thought of Jonas’s laugh, the one he used when he hated himself and wanted the room to forgive him before he spoke. He thought of his father holding a length of oak like a promise you could put your weight on. He thought of his mother in a kitchen with a pot that would outlive all of them. He thought of Alina, steady as a metronome, asking for the truth not as punishment but as oxygen. He got up when the bells told him to get up because even in grief you are allowed to take orders from metal.

In the room with glass, the red light came on, and an artificial voice said the time and date like a priest naming a feast day. The prosecutor did not make him a villain because paper does that better. She asked him again about breath and about hands, about the minute that takes seven seconds and the seven seconds that last a year. She said the line about intent because that is a hinge in rooms like this. He thought about the walnut handle in his pocket and the screw on the table at home and about all the small objects men have used to carry large things. He began to speak and then stopped because Wolf’s hand flexed the way a conductor’s hand flexes to keep a section from rushing. He began again and said, in a sentence he had not rehearsed because he did not trust rehearsed sentences anymore, that he had loved his brother in a way that had not always been kind.

He spoke about pressure and he did not name pressure. He spoke about mercy and he did not name mercy. He said he had smoothed the sheet the way he had smoothed it when he was seven and had thought smoothing might save their father from breaking a cup, and he watched the detective write down smoothing like it was a weapon. He said that death had already been in the room when he entered, that he had not invited it, that he had not turned it away. He stopped before the sentence that would have made the room tilt. Wolf said something in his measured clerk’s voice about processes and roles, and the prosecutor nodded with the faintest irritation of a person who has been given exactly what she asked for and nothing she wanted.

They left with a list of what would happen next, which is to say they left with a list of what nobody could promise. A decision would be made about charges. Another decision would be made about whether decisions could wait. The papers would write the word tragedy until it meant nothing. The basil would need repotting because its roots had ambitions. The screw would continue to be a screw, which is the best we can say of most things. On the steps, in the February air that pretended invulnerability, he felt the draft again and admitted, for today if not for always, that he would learn to live with doors open and with the cold and with the warmer human hands that find you when you least deserve them.

In the evening, because movement had to happen somewhere, he put on his shoes and walked to the river. The Rhine wore its gray like a uniform and pretended not to notice him. He leaned on the railing and thought of throwing the walnut handle in as if to make an offering, and then his hand tightened because offerings should not be made with what might still be needed. Two teenagers in coats too thin for advice tried to teach each other to smoke without coughing and failed and corrected and failed again. A man in a hat that had been fashionable in a different decade took a photograph of the bridge as if the bridge would change shape if you insisted. He walked back with the slow step of someone practicing a part, and at the corner by the kiosk he bought a bottle of milk as if milk could take the place of forgiveness.

When he reached his door, he found his father sitting on the step like a man deciding whether to knock. He held out a plank short enough to be carried, long enough to be not a gesture. The oak had been planed into planes that made the light rethink itself. His father said nothing for a while, which is how men avoid setting fires. Then he asked whether the coffin had sounded when they set it down on the trestles in the church, whether the resonance had told him anything about the wood’s mood. Lukas shook his head and said he had not listened and his father looked at him with the sorrow of a carpenter who knows there are sounds that do not return. They sat there with the plank across their knees like a bench they had built together by mistake, and for ten minutes the city did not ask them for words and they obliged and were grateful.

Inside, Alina set two cups of tea on the table as if pouring could be a welcome home, and his mother asked if they would like soup with the tea because some graces repeat without losing power. He put the oak plank on the chair opposite and watched it turn the ordinary room into a place where choices have weight. He wanted to say to the table, to the basil, to the people: I did it, or I didn’t, or I almost, or I thought, and the words arranged themselves like pigeons—suspicious, hungry, untrainable. He reached for the screw and put it in the grain of the oak and watched it sit there, ridiculous and correct, a small cross waiting for a hand and a decision. He closed his eyes for the length of a breath and opened them again to the same room, the same wood, the same doors, the same draft, the same cold, the same warmth, and the same impossible job of living.
