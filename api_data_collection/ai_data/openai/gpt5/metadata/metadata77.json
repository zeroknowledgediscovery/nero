     "novel_text": "The morning light in Bloomington has a habit of chewing through blinds and woodgrain and eyes, then softening like a secret. When the light reaches the corner booth at Grackle\u2019s Diner, the same corner where Rosa \u201cRo\u201d Avery is rolling out laminated dough, it turns the flour into halos and the baker into some kind of dusty saint. Ro smirks at the thought. Saint of stray croissants, patron of coffee refills and the twin gods of butter and heat.\n\nShe\u2019s got her hair shaved on the sides and left longer on top, dark as a crow and slicked back with something that smells faintly of rosemary. The regulars call her \u201ckid\u201d even though she\u2019s thirty-two and built like she could bench-press the espresso machine. Her forearms carry the story in pale scars and the faint ink lines from an old tattoo that everyone misreads as thunderclouds but is actually a stylized loaf, scored and opening like a book.\n\n\u201cRo!\u201d Hank hollers, leaning in from the dish pit. Hank is nineteen and always wet. \u201cWe out of jam.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d Ro says. She pats the dough. \u201cMomentum and jam: endless.\u201d\n\nHank raises his dish glove like a flag. \u201cNo, like, actually.\u201d\n\nRo points with her chin at the walk-in. \u201cBack left. Behind the vats. Don\u2019t drown.\u201d\n\nHank disappears. The bell over the door tinkles and brings in a sliver of cold that smells like rain and wet asphalt. Ro rolls. The laminated dough catches the light and she thinks of a meadow, the geologic layers of pastry that patience makes. She has always been a doer. She has recently become a listener to absences.\n\nIt started in late spring, the van sliding across gravel on a Sunday when she was on her way to Shelbyville to pick up a secondhand oven a friend swore was a bargain and would change her life (it did, but not in the way). The back wheel caught in a slick, the van fishtailed, a sound like God coughing and the windshield spidering into a spider\u2019s acres of web. The doctor said concussion. The MRI said nothing dramatic. Her days afterward said: something missing. Names she knew, highways she could trace with her thumbs closed, recipes she could make in sleep. But then there were bafflements: a gap where last winter should be, an echo where the end of October used to be, then January just... leaps. She woke up in March with strange muscle memory in her hands and a tiny flinch when she smelled lemon curd.\n\nFor months, she has moved like a person sorting the drawer where all the miscellaneous items go. Every day you pick something up and are not quite sure how or why you own it. And yet you do.\n\n\u201cRo,\u201d Mina says, sliding onto the counter with the grace of a cat that has read books about etiquette and chosen to ignore them. She is wearing a shirt with a hand-drawn comet on it and jeans with one knee repaired by a constellation of tiny stitches. Mina has been Ro\u2019s best friend since a summer in seventh grade when they broke into the pool after a thunderstorm and dared each other to jump. Ro has always jumped.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sit there,\u201d Ro says. \u201cIt\u2019s where people imagine they invented brunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came bearing news.\u201d Mina waggles her phone, which is wrapped in cracked plastic but still clings to life. She shoves it toward Ro with her elbows. \u201cFirst, the university cancelled the outdoor film festival because the projector swallowed a wasp. Second, the IU art museum is doing a ceramics night, and they will let you make a mug shaped like a loaf of bread. Third, you got an email.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I,\u201d Ro says without looking. The dough sighs under the pin and the room warms. \u201cFrom who? The governor? The NSA?\u201d\n\nMina makes her eyes wide. \u201cThe Bake Off people.\u201d\n\nRo stops rolling. The silence is a neat, exact thing, like when a TV is muted and everyone keeps moving. She does not lift her head. She slides the pin forward once, brings it back again, and then sets it down. The table breathes flour. She leaves white fingerprints on Mina\u2019s phone and taps into the inbox without reading the subject line.\n\nThe subject line is just: An invitation.\n\nHer heart does something indecorous. She opens it. The font is friendly. There\u2019s a logo she recognizes in a way that hurts a distant part of her, as if she has seen it under lights. Dear Rosa Avery, the email says. We\u2019re delighted to invite you to join the Final in this season of Bake Off. Due to a last-minute opening, we would be honored to have you in our tent. Please confirm availability, etcetera.\n\nRo stares long enough that Mina takes the phone back and scans it again. \u201cHoly sugar,\u201d Mina says, and because Mina respects the diner's air like a church, she does not cuss. \u201cIt\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nRo laughs. It\u2019s a bark, then something like relief or terror. \u201cIt\u2019s a prank.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmail addresses don\u2019t prank like that,\u201d Mina says, tap tap on the sender. \u201cLook, it\u2019s official. Also, they want you there in, like, a week. Ro, they want you to go on television. The television. The tent. The enormous mixing bowl. The soggy bottoms. You love soggy bottom jokes.\u201d\n\nRo hears herself say, \u201cI didn\u2019t even apply this season.\u201d\n\nMina tilts her head. \u201cWhat do you mean, this season?\u201d\n\nRo is not sure. She has the outline of a memory like a cup ring on a table: something was there, then lifted, and the circle remains. She knows the show. Everyone knows the show. She knows, in shadow and in muscle and in how her hands know to slash an X and fold butter into a sheet, that it matters to her in a way that is beyond normal. But how? She shakes her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t apply.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s like a best-of episode,\u201d Mina suggests. \u201cLike, champions return. Didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Ro says, too fast, then softer. \u201cI can call them.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall them,\u201d Mina says. She looks around as if expecting someone to roll in a camera rig that says Surprise! \u201cWhatever it is, you look like you just got struck by lightning and kissed by a stranger.\u201d\n\nRo wipes her hands until they are only mostly clean, then smears butter on her jeans by accident and laughs, and then goes into the office. The office is a closet with ambitions. The phone number in the email is a London area code. She doesn't think about the time difference until the line clicks and a woman with a voice like a radio host answers: \u201cBake Off production. Clare speaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d Ro says, and her voice sounds unfamiliar to her own ears. \u201cI\u2019m Rosa Avery. I think you, uh, sent me an email. I just wanted to confirm that this is real and not... Like. Spam, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cRosa! Wonderful,\u201d Clare says. Papers, voices in the background. \u201cYes, we\u2019re very real. We had an unexpected opening due to travel issues with one of our finalists. Your name was on a very short list. When I say very, I mean: one or two. Are you free to be in the tent next Friday?\u201d\n\nRo sits down on the desk chair that has one stubborn wheel. It slides. \u201cNext Friday. In the UK?\u201d The word tent goes through her like a chord in a song she used to know the harmony to.\n\n\u201cYes. We can get you to Heathrow. From\u2014 Indiana, correct?\u201d Clare pronounces Indiana like it\u2019s an exotic dessert. \u201cWe can handle accommodations. Of course you\u2019ll have to fill a few forms out\u2014 dietary, allergy, confidentiality. I\u2019ll send you a packet. Oh, and, um, congratulations.\u201d\n\nRo feels something in her chest that might be joy or might be panic. The world narrows. Then opens. \u201cI... yes. Yes, I can be there.\u201d\n\nMina leans into the office doorway like she has been pressed there by curiosity. When Ro covers the receiver, Mina whispers, \u201cIs it real? Is it real?\u201d Ro nods, and Mina\u2019s face splits into a grin so large it looks like it could swallow a sky.\n\nClare keeps talking about flights and what to bring and the filming schedule. Ro writes in blunt pencil that she licks to make it darker. She hears the word final again and again, the f in it like a flick of heat. When she closes the call and the office goes back to being quiet, she sits with the weight of it.\n\n\u201cShe cute?\u201d Mina asks, because there is no world where Mina does not make a joke when there is silence. \u201cThe voice?\u201d\n\nRo laughs. \u201cHer name is Clare.\u201d\n\n\u201cClare can be cute,\u201d Mina says with deep conviction. \u201cOh, Ro. You\u2019re going to be great. We have to make a list. You need to bring your measuring spoons that look like tiny whales. And your grater with the personality disorder. And that wooden spoon that\u2014 where did you get that wooden spoon again?\u201d\n\nRo thinks of the spoon with the burn mark like a crescent. She thinks of her kitchen drawer at home with the spool of twine she never replaces. She thinks, as if through fog, of a tent with white peaks and strings of bunting that ripple. Of judges with eyes like birds and the smell of fresh lemon under hot lights. The memory is not a memory. It\u2019s a leaning toward.\n\nHank bursts in with a jar of apricot jam. \u201cWe had apricot,\u201d he says, triumphant.\n\n\u201cUse it like it\u2019s 1997,\u201d Ro says. Mina and Ro lock eyes. It is real, it is absurd. The noise of the diner resumes like a lifted pause.\n\nShe makes croissants and thinks about the word final. It\u2019s a word like a door you close and hope opens again. She has been closing a lot of doors lately. Some of them will never open. Some of them already have and she just needs to turn around.\n\nBy the time the breakfast rush slows enough that her back stops screaming, she has called her mother and left a message that says, in a rush of air, \u201cI\u2019m going to the Bake Off final.\u201d She doesn\u2019t mention how her mother will hear the capital letters.\n\nMina conscripts Theo\u2014 Ro\u2019s brother\u2014 within an hour, because good news spreads faster than jam. He arrives at the diner with his hair still wet from his morning pool practice and a grin like he is nine again. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d he says into Ro\u2019s neck when he hugs her. \u201cYou\u2019re not. You\u2019re going to crush it. Can you make a cake with a pool in it? Like, an actual pool. With lanes.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay in your lane,\u201d Ro says, and then relents and adds a pool to the mental inventory of cake opportunities. \u201cLet me see. I need to get time off. I need to tell Harriet.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll get it,\u201d Theo says, as if Harriet, the owner of Grackle\u2019s, is their aunt instead of a person who hired Ro because Ro could look at a spreadsheet and a souffle with equal competence. Harriet, when told, raises an eyebrow and says, \u201cWe\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m mad at you for leaving me mid-semester but actually I will watch every second and pretend I taught you everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoever else is in the final is doomed,\u201d Hank declares, dragging a mop the way a knight might drag a spear.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t jinx me,\u201d Ro says, and here it comes, like the weather breaking. Mina has never been delicate. She is precise when it matters. She says, \u201cThere\u2019s a list.\u201d\n\n\u201cA list,\u201d Ro repeats.\n\n\u201cSomeone posted it. Someone always posts it,\u201d Mina says, half-apologetic but also not. \u201cI think you would have seen it anyway, but I went looking. Guess who\u2019s on it.\u201d\n\nRo stiffens, and she doesn\u2019t know why until she does. The shape of the name lands in her before she hears it. Some enemies are architecture. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Ro says again, and it has no weight.\n\n\u201cCeleste March,\u201d Mina says. Saying it is a small act of violence. \u201cShe\u2019s on the list.\u201d\n\nRo\u2019s fingers flex, flour ghosts. \u201cCeleste.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Mina says softly. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\nRo remembers\u2014 but does she?\u2014 a girl with a mouth like a razor and a coat that always smelled expensive. A girl who used to beat her on time by seconds and would always make that matter, a person who loved the optics of winning. They\u2019d met on the Bloomington bake circuit, which is less glamorous than it sounds and mostly involves church basements and the taste of paper cups. Celeste had been on and off in town, visiting her grandmother, and turning up wherever there were prizes and cameras. At an apple pie contest, Celeste had said, \u201cHandsome pies aren\u2019t always tasty,\u201d and looked at Ro like she had said something else. Ro had replied with, \u201cI don\u2019t make either of those,\u201d and the people around them had laughed, and it had felt like being pushed and pulled at the same time.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an arch-nemesis without the arch,\u201d Mina says with relish. \u201cJust a nemesis, really.\u201d\n\nRo goes back to work because the lens she knows best is the one that fits in her hand. She cuts squares of dough, lays ribbons of chocolate, folds, pinches. She knows what happens to people who make their enemies into architecture. Buildings fall. She breathes. Celeste had left town and gone to New York and was either a chef or a person who took photos of chefs. The last time Ro had seen her had been at the farmer\u2019s market in June before the accident. No\u2014 after? The chronology refuses to behave. Celeste had looked surprised to see Ro, like Ro had been a myth. Maybe Ro has always been a myth if you tilted your head. A stud with flour on her knees. The woman who shows up with a toolbox and a whisk.\n\nLater, in the calm that arrives like a cat and refuses to be called, Ro goes home. Her small apartment on the second floor of a house with a porch that creaks. The porch has a swing. The swing has held four sleeping people at once on nights the heat would not end. The kitchen window looks over a maple. When the light catches the leaves, it makes a thousand coins. There is a string of flags over the counter that she does not remember hanging. They look like they belong in a tent.\n\nShe stands in her kitchen and makes a list. The lists have been her survival. Lists and fixed points. She writes: passport, apron, reliable steel bowl, favorite whisk (curly handle), heat-proof gloves, notes, recipe ideas. Then she writes, in the bottom corner, like a secret: Remember to breathe in the tent.\n\nThere is a box under her bed that she tells herself has out-of-season boots. She drags it out. It is light. Not boots. She recognizes the tape\u2014 hosting tape with daisies printed on it\u2014 and the handwriting: hers. The past keeps leaving her notes like that, in her own hand, and she follows them as if the arrow is still leading her true.\n\nShe breaks the tape and lifts the lid. It is not boots. Inside is a folded apron that smells faintly of citrus and heat. It is the soft blue of cloud. The apron has a patch sewn onto it that says Bake Off in a looping font and a tiny embroidered rose someone has added. She picks it up the way you pick up a newborn: not sure where it will bend, not wanting to snap anything. Beneath the apron is a wooden spoon with a burn mark on the bowl and, under that, a rectangle of heavy cardstock. The card is glossy and has a photograph printed on it. The photograph is of a woman with a dimple in her left cheek and flour on her forehead, holding a cake that looks like a tower built by a person whose patience has been turned to sugar. The woman is Ro. The caption reads: Winner. Season (the number is framed out by her hand).\n\nIt is as if someone has reached into her chest and curled their hand around her heart to show her it exists. She drops the card. It falls face down and she cannot make it turn over.\n\nShe calls her mother again. Her mother picks up on the second ring and says, \u201cIf this is a telemarketer, you are about to learn some new vocabulary.\u201d\n\nRo says nothing for a beat. Then: \u201cMom.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d her mother says, and there is a note in her voice that says she has been expecting this call for months.\n\n\u201cThey asked me to go,\u201d Ro says. She sits on the floor beside the box and the apartment is suddenly too big. \u201cThey want me in the final. Next Friday.\u201d She says it like she is telling the weather to stop raining. \u201cI said yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Mom,\u201d Ro says, because the tightness in her chest has a name and it is a question, \u201cwhy is there a photo of me in a box under my bed that says winner on it?\u201d If she had written down the sentence and then had to describe the moment of reading it aloud, she would leave it blank so the reader could fill in the rest.\n\nHer mother is quiet, and Ro can hear the antiques shop where her mother works in the wind chimes and the timestamp of the register opening. \u201cHoney,\u201d her mother says. \u201cAfter the accident, we were... you asked us not to tell you anything until you asked yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were on TV,\u201d her mother says, and Ro hears the pride and the fear braided. \u201cLast year. You applied like the world was on fire and you were the only one who could bake the rain. You sent in a video that you filmed in our kitchen with the yellow walls. They called you. You left. It happened. There was a tent and judges and a whole universe. And then there was a trophy and a handshake that made you start crying, and you hate crying in front of people. But you cried, and you won. You came home, and then you went to get an oven in Shelbyville because you said you couldn\u2019t go back to a little oven anymore.\u201d\n\nRo\u2019s laugh is not a laugh. It breaks like a plate. \u201cThat was last year?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d her mother says. \u201cWe tried to tell you after the accident, but you didn\u2019t remember the fall\u2014 you didn\u2019t remember winter, really\u2014 and you got so upset when you saw videos that felt like someone else\u2019s life. The doctor said to let you set the pace. You started baking again. We figured... you\u2019d know when you were ready to know. I\u2019m sorry, honey. I thought you\u2019d want to open the box with me there.\u201d\n\nRo looks at the apron and the spoon and the card and the word winner that she did not let herself see. She has a memory now, but it does not feel like a memory yet; it feels like being told a story about herself that has the right shape. She touches the spoon again. The burn mark. The crescent. She can see it in a room too bright to be real and hands she can\u2019t quite claim lifting it like a sword.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I hang the apron on a hook?\u201d she asks, because her brain latches onto the wrong thing when the right thing is too sharp. \u201cI hang everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said if you saw it every day it would make the not-remembering worse,\u201d her mother says. \u201cYou said you wanted to want it on your own. You will. You do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got invited to the final,\u201d Ro says again, suddenly giddy. \u201cAgain.\u201d She wasn\u2019t there and she was. The word again is a bridge that doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a bridge. The past knocks and knocks.\n\nHer mother breathes out. \u201cBe careful with your heart in there,\u201d she says, and Ro doesn\u2019t know if she means cholesterol or metaphor. \u201cAnd tell that friend of yours\u2014 Mina?\u2014 to remind you to drink water. And don\u2019t let that girl get to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know.\u201d\n\n\u201cCeleste?\u201d\n\nHer mother sighs like she has been waiting for a storm and it has, finally, appeared. \u201cThat one. Last year you told me not to say her name because it made your eye twitch. She was mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cMean isn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d Ro says, and she feels that old, irrational, undefeatable surge of protectiveness for her own good humor. You can take the pie from the oven at the wrong time, you can drop the cake. You can take my winter. But don\u2019t you take my jokes.\n\nRo hangs up and the apartment resumes its normal dimensions. The light has moved across the floor. She picks up the card and makes herself look at it. Ro in the photograph looks like someone who has rehearsed the way to hold joy so it doesn\u2019t break. Maybe she did. Maybe she will again. She wants to throw up. She wants to run around the block. She wants to call Clare and say that she can\u2019t make it and also that she can\u2019t wait.\n\nThere is a list with Celeste\u2019s name on it. Ro opens her laptop and searches without searching. There it is: an article on a food site with too many ads. The headline is coy: Rumored Finalists Revealed? The names scroll. Ro\u2019s. A few others she recognizes in an odd sideways way, like a song you heard once in a car you didn\u2019t own. And Celeste March, of course. The photo with Celeste is black-and-white, artsy, knife-sharp. Celeste is all cheekbones and an expression that looks like she just thought of the way she\u2019ll win and is letting you see the corner of it. She has a caption with words like savant and ferment and pop-up.\n\nRo\u2019s mouth does that thing it does when she is angry: it goes careful. She does not slam the laptop shut in case it collapses like a thing with too much air in it. She stands instead. She paces the kitchen, which is not big. She almost knocks her elbow on the fridge three times. She runs water. She drinks the glass like it contains a secret.\n\nIt would be easier, she thinks, if this were all about baking. If it were just flour and eggs and the alchemy you do when you turn butter into glass and then into softness. But the tent\u2014 last time?\u2014 had not been just baking. It had been lights, yes, and a small haunted family of tents and a field and people. One of them had been Celeste. Had she? The memory tries to stand up and keeps not quite making it.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she says to the room, and the room accepts it.\n\nShe takes the apron to the sink and washes it by hand. The water turns a little warm and purls around her wrists. She hangs the apron over the chair back and stands so close to it that the blue feels like sky. She puts the spoon next to the stove. She knows she will carry it with her, a relic and a talisman and a weight.\n\nThere are more calls. Clare again, with a flight that departs in three days from Indianapolis. Harriet, with a long warning about how she hates goodbyes so Ro should just leave the keys on the hook and not make a fuss. Theo, again, because he is a persistent brother but this time with a playlist for plane anxiety that is mostly strings and the one song he knows makes her cry in a good way. Her aunt, who has a voice like steam and laughs that knock the wind out of you. Everyone says, do this. Everyone says, we love you. No one says, are you sure, because they know that Ro is never sure until she is inside the thing and then she is sure forever.\n\nAt midnight, with the window open so she can hear the small city be at ease with itself, Ro puts a notebook on the table and opens to a fresh page. She writes: Signature bake ideas, then leaves it blank because she hates filling in the first line. She writes: showstopper\u2014 something with Indiana summer, corn like sunshine, maple like that tree back there. She writes: proofing. She writes: sugar glass, spun. She doodles a tent and draws bunting that looks like tiny teeth.\n\nShe sleeps for three hours and dreams of a field that doesn\u2019t end, and a woman with a sharp smile cutting through it, and a judge with kind eyes lifting a hand toward her. She wakes with the shape of Celeste\u2019s name on her tongue like an aftertaste she can\u2019t get rid of. The morning is a punctuation mark: up. She goes to the market.\n\nAt the farmer\u2019s market, the vendors already know where she will move, because she always goes in the same order. She buys butter, obscene amounts, and pretends it is for a party. She buys eggs from a woman named Lark who writes little poems on the cartons. Ro reads one out loud: \u201cA yolk is a sun that forgot to shine outward.\u201d Lark laughs and blushes and asks Ro if she is going somewhere. Ro says, \u201cJust across an ocean, nothing serious,\u201d and the regulars in the coffee line hoot. Bloomington is a town that knows how to practice being a village. Everyone knows everyone and everyone assumes they don\u2019t know the parts that matter the most.\n\nOn the way home, she cuts through the bike repair co-op to tell Eddie she won\u2019t be at Wednesday night fix-it. Eddie looks at her calves in admiration and then says, \u201cI knew you were going to leave us for the glitz and glamour.\u201d He gives her a chain for a necklace, \u201cto ward off evil sprockets,\u201d and kisses both his fingers and taps her forehead. \u201cBring us back a scone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of scone.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurprise me.\u201d\n\nAt the door of her building, she catches her reflection in the glass and for a moment, it startles her. She looks like she has always looked: strong around the shoulders, eyes that go narrow when she is focusing, mouth with a scar at one corner that you\u2019d only notice if you kissed her. The person in the glass looks like someone who is ready for a thing she does not fully understand. She opens the door.\n\nAt home, there is a package on the stoop. It\u2019s addressed to her in a hand that tries to be anonymous and fails. Inside: a short, clean-edged metal whisk, heavier than the ones she owns. The handle is engraved. Winner. Ro. 2024. And below that, an arrow that points forward.\n\nShe should be surprised. She is not. She is something else. She is shaking, laugh-shaking, the way you do when you get the joke and also are the punchline. She loves the feel of metal in her hand. She hates seeing proof of last winter in a font. She holds the whisk up to the window light. The handle catches. The word is undeniable. It exists and does not require her belief to stand.\n\nA note tumbles out of the box. There is no signature. The message is two lines: If you forgot, that\u2019s okay. You remembered once. You\u2019ll do it again.\n\nShe puts the whisk down, gently, like it might break the table. She goes to the bathroom. She turns on the shower and does not get in. She grips the sink. She breathes. She watches herself in the mirror, water running behind her like weather. \u201cI\u2019m last year\u2019s winner,\u201d she says out loud, to see if the words sit right in her mouth. They are too big. They are good. They fall into place. In the mirror, her eyes change shape. The anger and the fear and the excitement make a braid.\n\nThe phone pings. There is another message she has been ignoring in the flood: a social media tag from the one person she wishes would stay out of her house. It\u2019s Celeste. A story, video-on, the voice with the edges. \u201cSee you in the tent, Avery,\u201d Celeste says, her mouth making the name like a dare. \u201cTry not to get lost.\u201d\n\nRo laughs. \u201cI was born lost,\u201d she tells the empty room and the shower and the whisk. \u201cWatch me find my way.\u201d She hits record and sends back a story that is only her hand cracking a single egg into a bowl, one-handed, clean and easy, the yolk unbroken. Then she puts her phone face down and goes to turn off the shower and sits on the bathroom floor with water spritzing her ankles, not crying and not not crying.\n\nIt will be okay. It will be a mess. It will be both. She has an apron that has seen something she cannot remember. She has a hand that knows what the rest of her does not, and a rival with a voice like a thin knife, and a city that smells like limestone and coffee and wet leaves. She has three days and a flight and a night to pack and a spoon that remembers fire. She has the word winner graved into metal, which is a kind of truth you can\u2019t un-etch.\n\nThe night leans its head on her shoulder. She gets up. She dries the edge of the sink with the hem of her shirt, because she cannot stand water beading, because something in her insists on finishing small things. In the kitchen, the blue apron makes a gentle shape on the chair that could be a memory if she lets it. Someone in the apartment below plays the same song for an hour in a way that suggests heartbreak or practice or both.\n\nRo sets out the bowls for morning. She writes one more note in the notebook, mid-page this time, no fear of breaking the first line: This time, remember that you love it. Then she puts her hand on the whisk like a person taking an oath. The display on the stove clock blinks an hour that is too late. Tomorrow will be too soon, and she will wake up anyway, and she will go to the place where lights and sugar meet. She will meet her nemesis in a line that isn\u2019t an arch, she will stand in a tent she has stood in before, and she will make something that does not exist yet, out of flour and butter and heat and something you can\u2019t weigh.\n\nOutside, the maple clicks. The fog gets ready. The city sleeps with one eye open. Ro sleeps with both and dreams of a long table, white cloth, a row of cakes like buildings. There\u2019s a hand that isn\u2019t hers\u2014 not yet\u2014 reaching to touch the crumb. When she wakes, her mouth tastes of lemon. She thinks, without knowing why, that she loved that judge with the kind eyes like a person loves a horizon. It was a thing to move toward, once. It will be again. Some mornings, you get the luxury of starting over. Some mornings, you start over without asking for luxury. Both kinds must be eaten warm, with jam.The morning puts its teeth on the edge of the blinds and bites, then thinks better of it and slides golden along the counter. Bloomington has a way of apologizing for night with light, and Ro stands in her kitchen with a mug that has never decided what color it wants to be and watches the blue apron make weather on the back of a chair. She slept like the kind of person who had to proof her dreams, and now the floury part of her brain is awake before the coffee has explained itself. She makes toast with too much butter, because she is loyal, and she scrapes the crumb to hear what it says back. Out the window the maple tosses coins again. Her hands move in the air of their own accord, kneading nothing. The nothing is not empty. It is full of a tent she cannot articulate and a name she will not avoid.\n\nMina texts her an alarmingly enthusiastic string of comet emojis and the words ceramics night still on? Ro replies with a thumbs-up and a loaf and then another loaf because one loaf is stingy. Before the museum, there are lists, and between the lists there is practice. Harriet reserves the back station for her, sliding over the roster with a shrug that says, without saying, go be a star and also don\u2019t tell anyone I said that. Hank hovers in the buoyant way of an overexcited planet. He carries a crate of eggs as if they are newborn kittens and asks if he should guard the door with a baking sheet like a shield. Ro tells him he can be her squire and he swells to the correct level of absurdity.\n\nShe lays out ingredients as if setting a stage. Bowls like moons, a forest of brushes, a square of marble she stole fair and square from the pastry department months ago with permission that arrived after the fact. Cornmeal in a bag she bought from a farmer whose knuckles are the color of wet rope. A bottle of maple that smells like October. A clutch of lemons, because avoidance is cowardly when it comes in the shape of fruit. She thinks of Indiana, persimmon pudding and jam thick as truth and limestone stacks that hold history together, and she knows showstoppers are besides the point until they aren\u2019t. Her pencil scrawls in the notebook, corn frangipane tart with maple glaze, candied corn silk nest, sugar glass shard river, and she circles the word nest because it makes her feel safe and smiled at.\n\nTheo arrives with a swim bag and that post-lap shimmer and kisses the top of her head like the annoying priest of a religion he invented five minutes ago. He declares himself quality control and steals a scrap of raw dough and makes a face to remind her he is an amateur. He pulls up a stool and gives a running commentary on the biomechanics of whisking that is ninety percent nonsense and ten percent something she will never admit helped. Mina bursts in like a second act, a jacket flung around her shoulders that is more patches than fabric, and a handful of tiny bottles of fancy vanilla she bought at a store that sells soap in colors that look like macarons. They make a ridiculous team in the reflected glass: Ro in her apron that will not admit its past, Mina in a shirt with a constellation on the wrong side of the sky, Theo in shorts and the arrogance of someone who can swim anyway. If a camera were here, Ro thinks, this is how they would want to frame it, the beloveds at the edges of a person who is about to leave.\n\nThey do not talk about Celeste while the sugar heats, because name-dropping is not unlike opening an oven too soon. The syrup goes through the stages like a book. Thread, soft ball, firm, hard. Her hand reaches for the spoon and finds the burn mark crescent; the world does a small tilt. She sees\u2014 does she?\u2014 a blaze of white tents like sails and the spoon making its orbit through amber light. Someone is saying, trust your nose, and she doesn\u2019t know who it is until she does, but she will not say the name aloud because if she names everything, there will be no air left. The snap is clean. The shards are savage and see-through. On the counter they look like a winter lake caught in the act of being honest. Mina claps in a way that would embarrass a less shameless person, and Theo whistles through his teeth and pretends he always knew she\u2019d get it right.\n\nWhen the lemon hits the heat with the sugar and the eggs, when she zest and the room fills with the exact brightness that made her flinch, she breathes into the sour and tells herself she has held sharper. The smell reaches through her like a wire and a memory unspools with it, not a full tape but a clip: a hand\u2014 hers\u2014 steady over a pot, a voice off to the side making a joke about curdling and nerves, a laugh with a kind weight in it. The laughter doesn\u2019t belong to her immediate people. It must belong to those tents. She scrapes the sieve with a spatula and the curd makes that obscene, cheerful slurp that means it set. The flinch eases like a door on a better hinge. Hank steals a spoonful and goes to his knees in mock prayer, because he cannot help it. The diner smells like a citrus grove opened a window.\n\nClare calls while Ro is wiping down, and the ring makes her put her palm over her heart as if the sound itself might knock it askew. There is always bustle at Clare\u2019s end, names called like ingredients, time called like a stern aunt. The flight is set for Thursday, out of Indianapolis at three in the afternoon, connection in Newark, then the long silver tube across the dark. Email follows with documents that say do not disclose in fonts that think they can throw their weight around. Clare\u2019s cheerfulness is industrial-strength, something that lifts in surprising places, and when she says, bring a signature that feels like you now, not like last year, Ro feels a sizzle of panic at the base of her skull and then a defiant spark. She nods though Clare cannot see her and says, \u201cI\u2019m not a person who repeats myself,\u201d and Mina mouths, you are, you absolutely are, and winks.\n\nThey talk last-minute logistics as if logistics are soft animals. Ro gives Harriet a stack of laminated schedules and instructions that are frankly insulting in their comprehensiveness, and Harriet squints at her over the rims of her readers and says, \u201cIf you die, I will kill you, but otherwise I\u2019m not worried,\u201d which in Harriet is very nearly a hug. Theo promises to take the morning shift Wednesday and Thursday and to stop making egg puns in front of customers who haven\u2019t consented. Hank solemnly vows to subdue any invasive wasps with a spray bottle and a mop. Bloomington\u2019s tiny network of kindness clicks like a gear.\n\nThey go to ceramics night because normalcy is the last rebellion sometimes. The art museum smells like clay and floor polish, and the tables are covered in brown paper and anticipation. An instructor with hair piled like a sculpture shows them how to coax a cylinder up from a lump as if they are calling it into being by having the right posture. Ro\u2019s hands know how to persuade texture into wanting more of itself, so the clay loves her on sight. She makes a mug that looks a little like the idea of a loaf and a little like a small animal trying to stand on its own. Mina makes something that claims to be a comet but will be happier as a bowl. The room hums with the particular concentration people get when they make a thing simply because a thing needs making, and the hum threads itself into Ro\u2019s sternum. Sometimes you save yourself by producing an object that will hold other things. She knows that, knows it in flour and now in clay.\n\nMina gets clay on her nose and pretends it is war paint. She tells Ro that she went down a rabbit hole and watched clips of last season with the sound off because she promised not to shove it at Ro until Ro asked. She says her favorite shot is of a pair of hands, Ro\u2019s, pulling sugar like light, and that she cried because it looked like the future and she is a sap. Ro listens carefully to the part where she cried and less carefully to everything else. She wants the future to be a thing she recognizes at least in the dark. She thinks she will bake a cake that tastes like the way Mina holds a coffee cup on the first cold day of the year. She wonders if that is possible, then feels personally responsible for making it so.\n\nOn the way back to the apartment they detour for donuts that have more metaphors than toppings. They sit on the curb because chairs are a conspiracy. A siren goes by as if to remind them that somewhere a small catastrophe is being managed, and they pass a maple-glazed ring between them with the solemnity of a sacrament. Mina pokes at the rumor list again with the caution of someone approaching a sleeping lion. She says Celeste\u2019s last pop-up in New York had a menu that made a critic say the word audacious three times as if it were an incantation. She says Celeste\u2019s hair is a sharp bob now and her eyes do that thing like she smelled blood. Ro says that Celeste has always staged her life like a photo and that a bob is a knife turned into hair. Mina says, \u201cPromise me something,\u201d and Ro says, \u201cIf you say don\u2019t let her live in your head rent-free I will raise your rent,\u201d and Mina says, \u201cPromise me you will not narrate her in your head. You save your brain for dough and light and maybe, if you are going to narrate, narrate the judge with the kind eyes looking at you like you are a horizon.\u201d Ro\u2019s breath goes sideways and then straightens. She says she promises. She means it for the length of the donut and another five minutes after, which is longer than you think when you are talking about an old, small war.\n\nHer mother calls the next morning with inventory updates that are a secret language. The antique shop has acquired a case of ceramic geese that stare the way only birds can. A man brought in a rooster weather vane that will not hold still. Someone found a box of recipe cards in a house being emptied for the second time and wanted Ro to see the one in a neat, upright hand for jam, written with the patient exactitude of a person who believed carefully measured life will not break as often. Her mother tells her the recipe over the phone, as if reciting a psalm. Ro writes it down and feels the shape of her grandmother\u2019s mouth in the words, the way certain syllables went hill-shaped and then back again. There is a new steadiness in her mother\u2019s voice now that the truth is opened like a window. It is relief and grief and pride in a tangle, and they both are smart enough not to comb it.\n\nAt the shop, later, when Ro ducks in with a bag of croissants because butter is the coin she pays for grace, her mother pulls a small tin from under the counter. Inside are three index cards and a photograph. The photograph is of a woman at a stove in a dress with a belt like a stern sentence. The woman is Ro\u2019s grandmother at twenty-five, elbow-deep in something that froths. The cards have recipes in her hand, and one is titled emergency cake and is mostly eggs and sugar and attitude. Her mother says, \u201cYou took after her hands,\u201d and Ro\u2019s hands suddenly belong to a longer story than she has been letting them belong to. She slips the cards into her notebook and leaves a croissant crumb map on the counter that her mother pretends to be offended by and then eats with her finger.\n\nPractice fills the cracks of the day until the day looks made of it. She laminates until the muscle memory quiets to something less urgent, and she stencils a pattern of corn stalks on a tart that makes Hank peer over her shoulder and whisper, \u201cYou wizard,\u201d as if he is afraid to break the sugar spell. She makes meringue that sits proud, not weeping, and she fights with a caramel cage that keeps deciding it wants to be modern art. Theo learns to torch without setting his shoelace on fire and gets obnoxiously proud of his torching face. They talk about the technical because it lives like a shadow. It will be something cruel disguised as fair, and Ro does not fear fair cruelty. She fears only the particular narrowness of her own absence. So she bakes basic loaves to remind herself that a good crumb is democracy, and she whips cream by hand to feel where it tips into butter, and she layers sponges like the floors of a house she is moving into again.\n\nCeleste posts three more stories for the public square, each one cut like a cheekbone and framed like she is not framing it at all. In one she is in a kitchen that is all angles and plants and steel, and her laugh is teethy. \u201cCounting days,\u201d she says to the camera with that soft, dangerous cadence. \u201cHope you\u2019re doing more than counting, Avery.\u201d The tag is a hook half-buried. Ro watches the first two and deletes the third as it arrives because she is not a dock and will not let herself be moored by someone else\u2019s rope. She posts a video with her phone propped on a sugar canister, not of her face but of a dough rising quiet and unstoppable under a glass bowl. She writes nothing. She lets watches. The glass fogs like a world being invented slowly. The likes come in like wildflowers on a roadside. She goes outside and kicks a stone just hard enough to remind her ankle of the universe.\n\nThe night before she leaves, she cannot make herself stop inventorying. She packs and unpacks the whisk with the engraved word six times before she talks sternly to herself about symbolism and carry-ons. She rolls socks into her mixing bowls because space is a puzzle she likes. She wraps the spoon with the crescent burn in the corner of a soft shirt and tucks it where a person might tuck a photograph. She opens the blue apron and runs her palm over the embroidered rose and wonders who added it for her and whether she cried when they did. She considers the possibility that it was her mother laboring at midnight with a needle and swears she can see one. She ties and unties the neck strap twice. She tapes a note to her own door that says keys? passport? forgiveness? with a square next to each, and she checks the first two and leaves the third blank because that is work you cannot perform and then throw in a bag.\n\nAt the diner\u2019s close, she stands with Harriet in the doorway while Hank counts the spoons as if the spoons might have multiplied in the drawer like rabbits when the light was off. The Saturday night regulars have gone home to their cats, to their shows, to their beds, and the place smells like bacon ghosts and mop water and the last pot of coffee giving up the ghost. Harriet says, \u201cIn case you need anything, I put money in the petty cash that is not petty and I labeled it travel. Take it,\u201d and Ro says, \u201cI am not twelve,\u201d and Harriet says, \u201cThen stop asking permission and act like someone who can say yes to a long flight.\u201d They have a hug that is not feminine and not masculine and very much a hug. They are, for a second, two people who have both chosen to belong to a place and to a person, which is risk, and are smiling about it anyway.\n\nBloomington, on the morning of the flight, is practicing being a postcard. The air is a little wet because it always is, and the courthouse square puts its shoulders back, and the guy on the corner with the banjo is picking something that might be a hymn if you tilt your head. Ro locks the door to her apartment and checks the handle twice for luck and because she is obsessive. The maple makes a sound like gossip. She leaves the trash out even though Thursday is not trash day because she thinks she is funny and because Mina will walk by and roll her eyes and deal with it, which is how they say I love you in their dialect. She carries the bag in one hand because she likes the weight and the promise of it, and she has the apron folded in the other like a flag that does not belong to a country but to a thing you do with your body and your hunger.\n\nAt the bus stop to the shuttle, she feels the hiccup of panic that is her body\u2019s way of telling her there is still a bear somewhere, even if it is only made of cameras and nerves. She breathes until she can remind herself to put the panic down like a too-hot pan. A man with a going-to-work face and a lunch pail nods at her bag and says, \u201cBusiness or pleasure?\u201d Ro says, \u201cBaking,\u201d and he says, \u201cThat\u2019s both,\u201d and grins that unshowy Midwestern grin that is better than luck. She thinks about the tent as a place with its own weather. She thinks about the judges as topography. She thinks about Celeste as a wind that changes direction to show off. She thinks about the word final and how it seemed like an end and now is a door. She tells herself that doors are what you make when walls are too proud.\n\nThe shuttle is late in the way that keeps you honest. Mina arrives with a thermos of coffee that tastes like Mina made it with her heart, and a paper bag of rolls she insists are lucky. Theo jogs the last block and presses a foil-wrapped something into Ro\u2019s hand and says, \u201cDon\u2019t open it until you are over the ocean,\u201d and then immediately tells her it is a peanut butter sandwich cut into triangles, because he is terrible at surprises. They crowd her like a pack, laughing too loud, because goodbyes require either whisper or riot and they are not whisperers. Harriet pulls up in her old truck and hands Ro a tin that turns out to be full of honey candy wrapped in wax paper and a screwdriver because you never know. Hank barrels around the corner drenched in dishwater and kisses her on the forehead like a benediction. Eddie from the bike co-op appears out of nowhere and loops a chain around her wrist like a bracelet and says it is for protection against mechanical failure, which is his religion.\n\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to come and be your manager or your bodyguard or your translator?\u201d Mina says, looping an arm over Ro\u2019s shoulders and digging in her heel so she swings them both a little, forcing the moment to balance. \u201cI speak British. I can say biscuit with authority.\u201d Ro leans into her and says she needs Mina here to watch the maple and to pretend not to read spoilers and to pick her up when she comes home with either very good news or very good cake.\n\nThe shuttle pulls up and Ro\u2019s stomach does a small, graceful flip like a diver who has stopped thinking about the water and is just letting gravity be. She hands her bag to a man who has seen everything that can be packed and is not impressed. She keeps the apron in her arms for a minute longer than is reasonable and then folds it into her carry-on, tucking the spoon and the whisk beside it so the three of them are in a row like people at a theater. She climbs aboard and sits by the window because she is sentimental and wants to watch her town shrink, because smallness is how you make room for other things. Her friends make faces at her through the glass until everyone, including a stranger in a suit, is laughing. The bus pulls away. Bloomington becomes a series of choices she made last week. The maple lofts another coin at the sky.\n\nOn the interstate, the billboards announce fireworks, sofas, lawyers, Jesus, and a pumpkin patch you can get lost in without trying. Cornfields run like repeating thoughts. The sky is a lid that someone forgot to screw on tight. Ro rests her head against the window and closes her eyes and feels, for the first time since the email, a thin thread of gratitude that is not covered in worry. It moves in her like yeast. It will lift the heavy parts if she lets it. She thinks of her grandmother\u2019s emergency cake and the way attitude was listed right in the ingredients, and she smiles because she is the descendant of a woman who wrote down attitude and expected you to measure it with your whole body.\n\nAt the airport, everything becomes fluorescent and rule-bound and slightly impossible. She moves through security like a person who has made peace with people telling her to take off her shoes. She is grateful for the apron in her bag the way you are grateful for a charm. She buys a magazine and does not read it. She texts her mother a photo of the gate sign and a heart that she pretends is a strawberry. She writes in the notebook in lurchy capital letters, remember to love it, and underlines it twice because she is greedy.\n\nWhen the plane takes off, the earth falls away, and Bloomington becomes a map you could fold. Ro feels her stomach drop and then level, and she thinks of the technical, of the way someone will put a recipe in front of her that has holes where the instructions should be and expect her to fill in the rest. She is not delicate. She is precise when it matters. She puts her hand flat on her knee and feels the steadiness under the metal. If you forgot, that\u2019s okay, the anonymous note had said. You remembered once. You\u2019ll do it again. She lets the words sit in her like a lemma. She believes in repetition if the point is to arrive changed.\n\nAbove the clouds it is a color you cannot name without being pretentious. The flight attendant with a dry voice offers pretzels and the possibility of wine, and Ro takes both because she is not dumb. She unwraps Theo\u2019s sandwich halfway to the ocean and eats it with the kind of reverence you reserve for reliquaries and good peanut butter. She thinks about Celeste, and the thought does not hurt for a whole minute. She thinks about the judge with the kind eyes, and the thought does that ache that is like a stretch, not like a strain. She lets herself imagine the tent again, not as a myth but as a place where she can stand and breathe and put sugar over flame and stand herself in the heat and decide that she likes it.\n\nNight over the Atlantic is a weight and a secret. Ro\u2019s eyes close. In the dream the tent rises out of a field like a city of light, and the bunting lifts in waves, and the table at the end of the aisle is laid for a banquet of what-if. Celeste is there, and the faces she can\u2019t quite bring into focus turn toward her, and somewhere in the dream a hand reaches and does not touch her but is close enough to count. She wakes with the taste of lemon again, and she smiles into the airline blanket and thinks, fine then, let it be lemon. Let everything be bright and a little dangerous and worth the burn. She looks out the window, at a dark that exists exquisitely without her opinion, and she thinks, if the horizon is a thing you move toward, she has been moving all along.The plane\u2019s wheels kiss the runway like they are surprised to find earth again, and the cabin erupts in that polite chorus of UK coughs and relieved exhalations that sound like the country is clearing its throat to speak to you civilly. Ro\u2019s spine registers all the angles she has held for seven hours, and when she stands, the world does a small slide and then decides to behave. Heathrow is a machine that has learned to pretend it\u2019s a maze, but she follows the signs for Arrivals as if someone had left her a trail of breadcrumbs that smell faintly of disinfectant and cinnamon. Her bag appears on the belt as though it had never left her, and the apron in it makes weight without making sound. When she steps into the wide mouth of the terminal, a woman with a clipboard and a scarf that looks like it is constantly, elegantly in motion says her name the way people do when they have been practicing the syllables of you for days.\n\n\u201cRosa!\u201d Clare says, and the exclamation point is baked in. \u201cYou look exactly like your emails, which is to say, efficient. Did you sleep at all? Doesn\u2019t matter. Come on. The car is this way. There\u2019s coffee, but it\u2019s airport coffee, so it knows what it is.\u201d\n\nOutside, the air feels narrower and softer, the light a courtesy more than a declaration. The car smells faintly of wool and ambition. Clare has a way of talking that stacks information into neat piles and then ties them with twine. The field is two hours, give or take the British love affair with traffic, she says. The inn is small and has opinions about toast. There\u2019s a walkthrough today\u2014just the lay of the land, cameras, introductions, any oh-my-gods that need taking care of. She says the other two have already landed and then doesn\u2019t have to say the names because Ro feels one of them like you feel a storm in your jaw.\n\nThey slip out of London like a needle threaded through hem. The highway becomes hedges and the hedges become fields and the fields become the argument for green. Ro\u2019s eyes find the old houses with faces like stern grandparents, the pubs with their chalkboards promising three adjectives for the price of one pie, the signs that say Give Way instead of Yield, which feels nicer even when it is not. Jet lag slides its hand into hers and squeezes a little too tight and then eases when Clare starts telling stories about things that have gone wrong in ways that make you proud of the going wrong. Last year the chocolate seized at the exact moment three cameras were being recalibrated, and a squirrel got inside the tent and had a moral crisis about being omnivorous. One season a baker forgot salt for an entire day and cried only once. There was an entire saga about Italian meringue and a mixer with a conscience.\n\n\u201cDo you remember the route?\u201d Clare asks at one point, throwing Ro a side glance that is careful in the way you are careful around a bruise.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember what tea I like here,\u201d Ro says, and the joke lands gently enough that the air around them relaxes. \u201cBut I remember hedges. These are very committed hedges.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the national personality,\u201d Clare says, pleased. \u201cContainment with charm.\u201d\n\nWhen the car turns down a lane that insists it is a road despite its protestations, the field opens like a palm. There are other tents like small cousins scattered about, but the big one is unmistakable: white, peaked, absurd, serene. The bunting is sleeping because the breeze hasn\u2019t found it yet. Ro has an irrational urge to take her shoes off and put her feet in the grass like a child meeting a lake. Instead, she stands in the parking area with her bag strap creasing her palm and watches the tent until her eyes do the thing where they water without permission.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Clare asks, soft-voiced, as if the tent might be listening for gossip.\n\nRo nods and then nods again, and then takes a breath into her back where breaths are supposed to be sturdier. \u201cI wrote on a piece of paper before I left,\u201d she says, because sometimes saying anything makes it easier to say the next thing. \u201cRemember to breathe in the tent. It was a joke and not a joke. I will be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be fine,\u201d Clare says, and then her production instincts make her add, \u201cYou just have to be here.\u201d\n\nInside, it\u2019s colder than it looks, the way big spaces are. The air is full of electricity and lemon and the faintest memory\u2014hers, not the tent\u2019s\u2014of a hundred episodes of desire. Stations line up like a military of possibility. Ovens with faces, mixers like loyal dogs. Someone is arranging a pyramid of eggs that will later pretend to be casual. Ro\u2019s station is a square of wood and steel and something that feels like a stage. Her name is on a little sign in a font that tries to be smiling without teeth. She puts her palm on the counter and, without meaning to, presses down until the grain answers.\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Clare murmurs. \u201cTouch everything. Meet the creatures.\u201d\n\nThe oven hums under her fingers in its resting state, dreaming of heat. The stand mixer does that proud little strut of a machine that knows it could outrun you if it had legs. The fridge is stainless and stoic. The drawers give way to reveal the choreography of tools, and when she finds the pastry scraper that is the exact width of her palm even here, she feels tears that will not arrive line up just in case. She slides the crescent-burned spoon from her bag and lays it on the counter as if she\u2019s planting a flag in a soft country. No one notices and everyone notices, but in that special way of this place where meaning is quiet until it needs not to be.\n\nThe other two finalists stand at their stations pretending they are not measuring each other with their peripheral vision. One is a man with the gentle shoulders of someone who carries trays for a living and the hands of a person who knows about heat. He has a salt-and-pepper beard and a smile that looks like it could talk you out of panicking with a story about his aunt\u2019s pudding. He introduces himself as Arjun, a pastry chef from Cardiff who makes tarts the way some people make treaties. The other is Celeste, of course, a geometry of angles and intention, in a shirt that photographs well and hair that could be a weapon. Celeste\u2019s smile when she clocks Ro is not kind or unkind; it is precise, like slicing a lemon exactly in half.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Celeste says, as if they are at a reunion for people who committed crimes together and got away with it. \u201cThey do love a narrative.\u201d\n\nArjun winces because he is polite and because he does not yet know the history. \u201cI am just glad I packed the right plug adapter,\u201d he says, which is a peace offering.\n\nRo moves toward her rival like gravity is a dare. \u201cI am the narrative,\u201d she says, and Celeste\u2019s laugh is the edge of a knife hitting wood at a satisfying angle.\n\n\u201cSo you remembered to bring jokes,\u201d Celeste says, glancing down at the spoon with the burn mark like it is a religious symbol and she is deciding whether to convert. \u201cI wondered which version of you would turn up. The wild card, the golden child, the one who forgets things, the one who wins. I would have studied.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou studied anyway,\u201d Ro says, mild, because this was always a war of tone, and you do not bring a cannon to a conversation.\n\n\u201cEvery day,\u201d Celeste murmurs, and there is something like truth in it, which is the most dangerous part of her.\n\nIntroductions unspool with the efficiency of a well-rehearsed play. Producers whose names are sticky in the best way, sound techs with belts like Swiss Army knives, camera operators with the soft eyes of people who watch carefully for a living. The hosts arrive like exclamation points drawn with eyeliner, interested and absurd and fully themselves. They shake hands with exaggerated solemnity and immediately start testing the angles of the tent for jokes, which the tent likes, because it is not humorless, just large. Ro is framed by a shoulder and a laugh and then delivered back into light.\n\nWhen the judges enter, the temperature shifts in a way that has nothing to do with air. They are not gods, but they are weather. One is a man whose face has been carved out of the idea of a handshake, blue-eyed and economical with his warmth, which is why when it arrives, people weep. The other is a woman with jewelry extravagant enough to be its own character and eyes that hold generosity like a profession. Ro\u2019s bones perform an old choreography when those eyes sweep the room; she feels relief that does not have an origin point. The kind-eyed judge meets her gaze and something in Ro\u2019s chest sounds like a baking sheet settling. It isn\u2019t recognition in the way you think of recognition, but it is that feeling of seeing a horizon and suddenly knowing which way is east.\n\n\u201cWelcome back,\u201d the woman says, a small edge of mischief in the welcome as if she\u2019s been waiting to say it, and maybe she has. \u201cTo both the field and the field\u2019s ghosts. We are very happy to have you here.\u201d\n\nRo wants to say thank you, and does, but the other thing she wants to say is ridiculous\u2014something like I think I missed you, which is unfair to place on someone you do not actually know. The man gives her a nod that contains, somehow, the handshake she hasn\u2019t yet earned this season and the one she already did last, which is more complicated than bread.\n\nThey run through safety and schedule and the ritual of pretending the tent is not always full of people before they say action. There are rules about ovens and rules about knives and rules about where to stand so you don\u2019t become an accident with a monologue. Ro listens and takes notes she won\u2019t read because writing them makes a pocket in her mind. When they get to the part where the judges will announce the Signature in the morning\u2014keep your flavors clean, your lines clear, your nerves in the appropriate drawer\u2014she feels the good fear, the one that comes with a slender smile attached.\n\nThey break for tea in a secondary tent that is a canteen and a confessional. The tea is the sort that convinces you you\u2019ve done something right in a past life. Someone has put a plate of shortbread out that tastes like butter had a dream about being polite. Arjun tells a story about the time he dropped a croquembouche and saved it with a vow and a glue of caramel that still haunts him in summer. Celeste scrolls through her phone and then not-so-subtly angles the screen away from Ro, who does not care until she does. The kind-eyed judge sits at a corner table with a stack of papers and a pen that looks like it could correct you without making you hate yourself. Ro finds herself drifting that way without a plan, as if the chair next to that gravity has been empty all day waiting for whatever Ro is now.\n\n\u201cI brought you something,\u201d the judge says without preamble, and produces from her bag a small tin the size of a person\u2019s forgiveness. \u201cDon\u2019t be cross. I know you know we can\u2019t technically give you gifts, but I put these together when I heard you were coming back because I wanted you to have a thing that tasted like steady. Lemon biscuits. My grandmother\u2019s. I promise the irony isn\u2019t lost on me.\u201d\n\nRo blinks, then laughs because laughing is what she does when the universe hands her a scene and expects her to behave. \u201cIf I swoon that will be very embarrassing for both of us,\u201d she says, and the judge\u2019s mouth makes a shape like it has known worse.\n\n\u201cYou can swoon lying down,\u201d she says, dry to the point of desert. \u201cEat one now or later as you like. We are not doing a lemon challenge. That is not a spoiler. That is a kindness.\u201d\n\nRo takes one. The biscuit snaps exactly right and fills the room with that clean, holy sour. It lands on her tongue and is not a flashback; it is an invitation. The flinch that lemon has been leaving like a calling card doesn\u2019t show up to the party. She feels the relief of a person who tried a door twice and finally found it unlocked. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says, which is insufficient, and the judge\u2019s hand does that tapping thing people do near their teacup when they are pleased.\n\n\u201cMake what you are now,\u201d the judge says, as if it\u2019s easy and the hardest thing. \u201cNot what you think we remember. The tent is not sentimental. But I am,\u201d she adds, her eyes going bright with something that looks suspiciously like fondness. \u201cAnd I am allowed to be.\u201d\n\nArjun informs them very seriously that he has brought a lucky tea towel that his daughter embroidered with a whale that looks like a potato and that his wife says he is not allowed to wash under any circumstances. Celeste overhears, executes an eye roll that would win awards if that sort of thing had a category, and then admits that she keeps a coil of string in her pocket that her grandmother used to tie pastry boxes with and that touching it before a bake has always been like checking her pulse. \u201cDon\u2019t overinterpret it,\u201d she warns, which is the same as instructing the clouds not to be sky.\n\nThe inn that night is the kind of old that makes every floorboard look like it has a long story to tell you if only you\u2019d buy it a beer. Ro\u2019s room is up two narrow flights of stairs and under a slope of roof that will bang its head if you try to sit up too fast. The wallpaper is floral in the way of polite hauntings, and there is a window with a view of a tree that is not her maple but is nosy and comforting anyway. She opens her bag and lays the blue apron on the bed like a map. Touching it in this new country changes the taste of the memory in her mouth\u2014less shock, more curiosity. She leaves it there while she splashes water on her face from a sink that makes the idea of turning taps into a ritual.\n\nMina calls without fanfare, because time zones are a suggestion. The video freezes twice, and Mina still manages to get clay on her cheek though she has not touched clay since yesterday. She asks what the rooms smell like. Ro says beeswax and lemon biscuit, and Mina declares she will marry the building. They talk for eleven minutes about the tree outside the window because talking about small things is how you make the big thing fit in your chest. Theo appears in the background at Mina\u2019s apartment, wearing a towel like a toga because he does not know what clothes are. He crosses himself like a swimming Catholic and says, \u201cTorch responsibly,\u201d and exits frame to a chorus of groans.\n\nRo writes in the notebook until the pages feel heavier. Signature ideas that feel like Indiana translated into patisserie, not a pastiche, not a state fair, but the part of home that can stand up to cameras without flinching. She sketches a tartlet that uses corn in three textures\u2014cornmeal shell, corn custard, corn silk sugared and crisp\u2014married to maple like two old women who finally got to live together legally. A second set that nods toward the limestone quarries, sugar glass and white chocolate, a geology of sweetness that will break just right. The temptation to be clever is loud; she makes it sit in the corner with a biscuit. The showstopper sketch is ridiculous in scale and stubborn in its simplicity: a layered cake rising in terraces like a courthouse square, each level a season she lived through whether or not she remembers, painted with syrups that taste like rain and an early frost. She writes, do not sugar-sculpt the maple leaf unless you will do it well, and underlines well twice.\n\nIn the half-sleep before dawn, a dream arrives with its hands up to show it\u2019s unarmed. The tent again, but close now, the clink of spoons and the soft rasp of someone whispering their list under their breath like a prayer. She stands at her station and there is a hand on the other side of her, the judge\u2019s hand this time, not touching, just a gravity, and she hears, as if the dream has a sound designer, her own voice say, I think I love this, and then wakes with her heart obligingly going in a steady line rather than a canyon.\n\nCall time is an hour that should be illegal. The makeup people are kind in that brisk way that keeps nerves from becoming your entire personality. They add a fiction of sleep to under-eyes and throw her hair into a category called intentional. The wardrobe person hands her the production apron and doesn\u2019t blink when she asks if she might wear the blue one underneath, beneath the canvas like a secret. \u201cIf anyone asks,\u201d the wardrobe person says, pinning a rogue strap, \u201cit\u2019s a layer. Layers are flattering.\u201d\n\nThe tent hums as bodies file in, everyone circling their spots the way birds circle branches before committing. The hosts do a rehearsal of the opening lines with a degree of goof that would embarrass mortals, then go softer and let the cameras see the part of them that loves this as a craft. The judges stand like weather systems pretending to be people, hands folded, faces open enough to let you hope and stern enough to let you know hope is a dessert, not a main.\n\nClare squeezes Ro\u2019s shoulder as she clips the microphone pack to the waistband of her jeans, the production equivalent of a benediction. \u201cYou ready?\u201d she asks, and the tone is medical: do you need anything before we start cutting?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ro says, and then tells the truth, which is, \u201cYes,\u201d and what she needs is Guatemalan coffee and five more hours, but what she gets is the deep breath she practiced and the spoon under her hand like a history book she likes again. Arjun makes eyes at her as if to say, we survived airports; we can survive this. Celeste taps her pocket where the string lives and holds Ro\u2019s gaze for a second longer than is hospitable. \u201cTry not to fall in love with the tent twice,\u201d Celeste murmurs, not unkind, and Ro could hate her for that and chooses not to. She puts her hand on her station and says, \u201cMy heart is a polyamorous disaster; it will be fine,\u201d and Arjun chokes on his own laugh so loudly a sound tech checks his levels.\n\nThe countdown happens like it always does in this place where ritual is measured out in butter and nerves. The hosts stand at the front, grins calibrated, voices pitched to cut through sugar dust. The gentleman judge clears his throat, the lady judge adjusts her bangles, the crew holds their breath without being told to. The words roll out in the exact cadence that lives in the collective human unconscious now, the instruction that is both invitation and dare. Somewhere, an egg unembarrasses itself by being perfect. Somewhere, a whisk dreams of becoming air. Somewhere, a woman from Bloomington who won last time without remembering it now stands at a table looking at a bowl and a pile of lemons and a sack of cornmeal and thinks, I am different and I am the same and here is my proof.\n\nThe Signature is announced, and the tent leans forward as if it has ears. Twelve small tarts, the judges say, identical, two flavors represented, one fruit-led, one indulgent, crisp cases, delicate finish, three hours. It is, in other words, a way to see if your hands know how to speak in both accents without translating. Ro hears the words like a metronome. Her mind does a quick inventory of what she has in her arsenal that is not a brag. Corn and maple, she thinks, because Indiana should have a seat, and lemon and thyme, she decides, because she owes citrus a good moment and because the smell of thyme in butter makes her less afraid of herself.\n\nTime is a trapeze. Ro measures butter with the speed of people who have made mistakes and would prefer not to repeat them. The pastry comes together under her hands with the promiscuous affection of flour for fat. She refrigerates with the exactitude of a surgeon closing a chest. She zests lemon and lets the oils spray her hands until her skin starts to smell like courage. Across from her, Arjun is making something custard-forward that is going to make someone\u2019s grandmother appear in the corner and nod. Celeste, infuriatingly, looks as if this is a warm-up, which might be true and might be staging, and Ro refuses to invest in that stock.\n\nHosts flit by like helpful bees. One of them leans a hip against her station and asks her with that conspirator\u2019s tone how you get corn silk to behave. \u201cYou bribe it,\u201d Ro says, sugaring the strands with patience. \u201cPromise it a better life, tell it it\u2019s pretty, and then put it on top of something that can hold it up.\u201d The host cackles and moves on to Arjun, who is muttering respectful things to his tart shells like a man giving a pep talk to a wall that insists on being a door.\n\nThe male judge looms at her elbow as if looming were a kindness, and perhaps in him it is. He lifts a corner of the pastry case without touching anything, which is a magic trick he has had years to practice. \u201cCorn,\u201d he says, flat, as if the word owes him money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my home,\u201d Ro says, and then, because she cannot help herself, \u201cand maple pays the rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cClever is cheap,\u201d he says, with the faintest wink that could also be a twitch. \u201cBut if your bake is good, I will forgive you for the pun.\u201d\n\nThe kind-eyed judge follows in his wake and smiles at the lemon zest under Ro\u2019s nails like it is a letter she plans to answer. \u201cWe like a baker who courts difficulty,\u201d she says mildly. \u201cWe like her better if she wins.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like me if I win, too,\u201d Ro says, and the judge\u2019s laugh is that same weighty, kind noise from before, the sound of a lid lifted up for a second to let steam out, so everything doesn\u2019t blow.\n\nRolling, lining, blind-baking. Sugar boiled to exactly the temperature that will not punish you for stopping too soon. There is a moment where the corn custard wants to become scrambled eggs, and Ro murmurs at it with the sternness of an aunt at a christening, and it yields to her good intentions. The lemon curd goes silky like it has been practicing this muscle memory on its own time. She pipes without flourish because this is a time for rightness, not drama, and the sugared corn silk nest perches on top like it was born there, like the word nest is literal. The thyme, picked leaf by leaf, freckle-kisses the lemon tops. The maple glaze goes on with a thin, exact sheen that makes the tarts look as if they know their own faces under their makeup.\n\nCeleste, of course, pulls hers out as if timing were a lover who always arrives on time for her and leaves when she says. She does something with fermented fruit that smells mysterious and dangerous and like she will argue with you later and win. Arjun arranges his piped cream in a geometry that would make a math teacher sigh happily. Around them, the tent makes the sounds of spatulas against bowls, the small oaths of people who have miscounted by one and the ecstatic inhale of someone whose caramel did not crystallize this time. Outside, a bird absolutely uninterested in television lands on a pole and considers whether a tent makes a good windbreak.\n\nThe minute hand becomes the kind of enemy you can negotiate with or be broken by. Ro places her tarts on the slate like she is laying down a hand of cards she believes in and, with a spare thirty-four seconds that feel like a joke, wipes her bench in straight lines because that is the ritual she developed last year and only barely remembers. Celeste catches the movement out of the corner of her eye and almost imperceptibly mirrors it, which tells Ro two things at once. It tells her that some habits communicate across the amnesia, and it tells her that Celeste watches her more closely than she will ever admit.\n\n\u201cHands up,\u201d the call comes, and the tent is a held breath. Ro\u2019s hands go up, and the blue apron under the canvas one warms with her, and the spoon on her station looks stupidly small in the context of cameras and chatter and nerves. She drops them to her sides and looks at her work and thinks, if the past is a country I have visited, this is a souvenir I can actually use. She looks at Celeste and thinks, try me. She looks at the kind-eyed judge and thinks, horizon. Then she looks at the floor because she needs the ground to be a thing she can count on in this country where counting is sometimes poetry and sometimes math. The judges move forward, the hosts lean in, the crew inhales, and somewhere far away in Bloomington, a maple leaf trembles without cause and without apology.The first bite the judges take is always for the cameras and also never for the cameras. They lean in as one might lean into a good storm, and Arjun goes first because the order rotates with an ancient fairness that does not mind being stage-managed. The blue-eyed judge taps the crust with a fingernail and nods once, fractional, the way bank vaults nod. The kind-eyed judge tilts her head to let the scent in properly, then lifts a tart and looks at its bottom as if the tart has a secret it will only tell her. They talk low and generous about custard set and the way nutmeg should be a rumor, not a headline. Arjun\u2019s smile creases into relief like a map that has given up pretending it wasn\u2019t folded. He looks up at Ro for a second like you look up at a person who happened to be in the room when your child took a first step, and she gives him a grin that is mostly teeth and palm-sweat. He will be dangerous in the kind way, the way that disarms you into rooting for his victory even when you are busy trying to win.\n\nCeleste is a study in loaded calm. She has plated as if symmetry were a challenge she set and met hours ago. Her fermented fruit gleams like she whispered wicked things to it and it giggled. The blue-eyed judge\u2019s mouth does a thing it does when he admires technique but dislikes being made to say it out loud; the corners lift with reluctance built in. \u201cYou took a risk with fermentation,\u201d he says, and Celeste\u2019s eyes flash with the satisfaction of a woman who sells high and buys lower. \u201cIt paid off,\u201d he adds, and she pretends she had not already written that praise for herself in her head.\n\n\u201cYour pastry\u2019s a touch thick on two of them,\u201d the kind-eyed judge murmurs, running a finger along an edge and showing a flake to the air as if she is consulting the tent. \u201cBut the flavor is controlled and surprising. It tastes like you\u2019re making a promise you intend to keep.\u201d Celeste does not blush, but there is a shift in her shoulder that says she heard an older woman approve of her and that will echo for longer than she\u2019ll volunteer.\n\nRo\u2019s slate is a small landscape of Indiana smuggled under canvas. For a second she has an idiot\u2019s urge to put her hands over them and say, \u201cBe kind,\u201d like a mother bird making herself look large. She moves her hands to the sides and does not explain herself. The blue-eyed judge lifts a lemon and thyme tart and cuts cleanly; the cross-section is a poem about steadiness. He smells, he bites, he holds his face in that austere way he has that makes bakers forget language. \u201cThe zest is generous,\u201d he says, finally, a short sermon. \u201cBorderline dangerous. But the curd is set perfectly, and the thyme is not shouting which is rare for herbs in a dessert.\u201d\n\nThe kind-eyed judge\u2019s mouth curves in that way that would make Ro donate a kidney. \u201cIt\u2019s bright without being a slap,\u201d she says. \u201cI like the restraint in the finish. Your piping is not trying to impress anyone it doesn\u2019t have to impress.\u201d\n\nHe moves to the corn and maple and the presence of an American ingredient in this hallowed field makes him hold a breath he thinks people can\u2019t hear. He cracks the tart like a safe\u2014no, like a person who loves a crisp shell the way some people love first lines of novels. The custard is satin that knows the word grain but chooses not to say it. He bites and waits. Ro can feel the tent lean; the corn silk crunches when his knife nudges it. \u201cUnexpected,\u201d he says, which is a word that can mean you have disappointed him or delighted him. He swallows like a judge swallowing does when sweetness and salt did not betray him. \u201cThis is excellent,\u201d he finishes, offensively restrained. \u201cMaple is the right size here. And you\u2019ve respected the corn without turning this into a thesis about your hometown.\u201d\n\nThe kind-eyed judge is less stingy with weather. \u201cI had my doubts about the silk,\u201d she says frankly, teeth showing in the way wolves show their teeth to indicate they are friendly. \u201cI\u2019ve had some very silly garnish in this tent, Rosa. But this is crisp and gentle. It\u2019s not showing off. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d she searches in her pocket for a word and drags it out like a coin, \u201c\u2014familiar, which is the highest compliment I can pay to a new thing. It reminds me of something I have not eaten before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Ro says, and means it down to her heel bones. The lemon flinch has not shown its face. Somewhere behind the cameras Clare nods at no one and tickmarks something on a list because producers get to keep small scores in their pockets like other people keep mints.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a handshake. It would be indecent this early, and also not the story the tent wants to tell today. There is, though, the ghost of a handshake, which is the thing that happens when his eyes meet yours with approval and you feel the phantom warmth of an offered palm you have held before. Ro keeps the memory where it can\u2019t startle her later and turns to watch Arjun receive a pat on the bench from a host who adores him already, and Celeste accept praise like it came with her lease.\n\nThey reset the tent with the quiet thunder of thirty people doing fifteen things. Signature box checked and carried away with more ceremony than it would get anywhere else on earth, benches scraped of the evidence of nerves, cameras reloaded with more seconds. The hosts, bless them, run into the side tent and emerge with new jokes and slightly different shirts, the way some people change earrings to match the way the day is going. The three finalists are given five minutes to pee and one to look into nothing in particular to remember that they are animals who need water. Ro sips and watches the lemon biscuit tin on the corner of the judges\u2019 table as if it might slide toward her of its own accord. The kind-eyed judge catches her gaze and raises one eyebrow, and Ro feels discovered in a way she is not sorry about.\n\nThe Technical is announced with a degree of glee that makes everyone suspect someone in production won a bet. The blue-eyed judge does the honors, voice like a guillotine dressed in velvet. \u201cFor your Technical Challenge,\u201d he says, and it is capitalized in the air, \u201cwe would like twelve kouign-amann.\u201d The French burred in his mouth makes bakers two counties over flinch. \u201cLayers, lamination, caramelization, patience. Ingredients and a pared-back recipe are under your benches. You have three hours. Begin.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an audible intake that is only half groan. It is cruel and fair in the exact ratio this place likes. Lamination on a timescale that is not moral, sugar waiting like a trap, butter threatening mutiny if you look at it sideways. Ro\u2019s hands move before her brain has fully unstacked the implications. Flour down. Butter in. She slices and arranges and reins in the desire to overwork because the Technical is a god that punishes hubris. The pared-back recipe is a love letter to omission: \u201cMake the dough. Laminate. Turn. Turn. Rest. Sugar. Shape. Prove. Bake until caramelized.\u201d\n\nHer body remembers. It remembers the silk of butter when it is the correct temperature, the way the pin needs to be a weight and a whisper, the way the dough will tell you when it does not consent, and you must stop and let it look out the window for a minute. Her forearms carry the story; the blue apron under the official one warms like a stove brick still holding last night\u2019s heat.\n\nArjun mutters to his butter in Welsh and to his dough in English. It is the most charming spell Ro has ever heard. Celeste works with an aggression that would make duels unnecessary; she whacks coolly, like she has told butter where to go and it obeys out of respect.\n\nThe first turn holds the tent in a quiet that is like being in a church where everyone is secretly listening for the wrong thing. Ro rolls and folds and turns and marks a thumbprint in the corner as she always does\u2014one print means first turn, two means second, three means the edge of triumph and catastrophe. She works quickly and then forces herself to stop when stopping is what saves the day. The temptation to push is a young person\u2019s sin; she has had that smacked out of her by ovens and accidents and the look on her mother\u2019s face when she came home with winter missing.\n\nSugar time is the reckoning. It sifts down like snow over the dough sheets that are now a stratigraphy of effort and physics. It crunches under the pin with a sound that makes something in Ro\u2019s chest match pace. The bench becomes a beach of white that will turn to amber if you treat it with heat and respect. She cuts the squares with a ruler she pretends is not ridiculous, folds corners to center like small parcels you would like to receive from a kind aunt, and nests them into buttered muffin tins that will cradle and then scorch their sides into that marriage of crisp and tender people write sonnets about.\n\nCeleste shapes like a general, efficient and ruthless. She uses a little more sugar than any mortal would, which is a hedge or a flex; it will do one of two things: it will make her the queen, or it will break her teeth. Arjun is methodical to the point of provocation. He whistles something that sounds like his daughter\u2019s whale, and each piece is like the last, a democracy of butter.\n\nProving is a test of nerve. The tent is not the temperature anyone wants it to be; it never is, because weather is a character and she likes to improvise. Ro eyes the proving drawers and spares herself a silent prayer to the god of yeast, who is both petty and generous. She slides her tins in and steps back like a person leaving a room to let someone else finish crying.\n\nThe wait is where people make bad friends with their brains. Ro wipes her bench in obsessive stripes and then stops and forces herself to drink water. The hosts wander in with the energy of two people who cannot be dull at work or their bones will dissolve. One perches and asks Arjun what song he would bake to if the tent let him bring music. He answers with a hymn and a rock ballad and then insists the only correct baking music is the sound of butter becoming something else. The other host lisps at Ro\u2019s sugar strategy with the glee of a raccoon who has discovered the recycling bin and asks whether she will use the spare moment to compose a haiku about caramel. Ro deadpans one into existence and it is actually decent, and the host stamps around pretending to be furious and in love with her, which is exactly what the tent wants at ten past whatever o\u2019clock this is.\n\nWhen the proving is judged acceptable by the way the dough looks proud but not cocky, bakers all over the tent smile in relief that lasts exactly as long as it takes to slide their tins into ovens and realize there is nothing left to do but wait and doubt. Ro presses her palm to the oven door and feels the heat like a promise and a warning. This is the part of baking that has always felt like faith to her; you do the things you can do, and then you step back and let heat and time do theirs, and if you stand there and shout you\u2019ll only scare the yeast. She closes her eyes, just for a blink, and in the blink she is in last year, the shape of the tent around her the same and also not, a run of days where this exact quiet is where she found herself enough times that the quiet started saving her back.\n\nWhen they come out, the room fills with the smell of sugar making a decision to be something better than itself. The sands of time in pastry form cling to the tins; you have to wait the correct number of seconds or you will slide them and pull the skin right off their caramel skins. Celeste waits a fraction too little and a corner resists and tears. Her face does not shift, but her neck muscle leaps like a horse. Arjun mutters a word in Welsh that is not a hymn and not a curse, and then remembers where he is and turns it into a blessing halfway through. Ro waits the way she taught herself, letting the sound resolve into the crisp, the sense that if she shook the tin the pastry would shrug and let go. She knocks hers out with a tremor that is not visible if you don\u2019t know her.\n\nBlind judging goes like a rumor through a small town: brisk, whispery, inevitable. They line theirs up and step back, hands tucked under armpits, water bottles hugged like talismans. The blue-eyed judge slices one, sniffs an inhale of sugar fog, and bites. He does not smile. He points out, for several, the tragedy of a raw center, the sin of stinginess with sugar, the grievous wound of under-lamination. He pauses at one and taps the crisp layer on top with a knife like he is looking for a hollow spot in a wall. \u201cThis,\u201d he says, and he does not need to say more. The kind-eyed judge reads the strata like tea leaves and smiles at one where the sugar has gone mahogany rather than black, approves of a restrained sweetness that allows butter to speak. When they pull the towel on the numbers to reveal names, Arjun is safely second with a praise that lands like a pat on the back strong enough to fix your posture for a week. Celeste, who gambled, finds herself in third with a look that promises vengeance so elegant it will be mistaken for hospitality. Ro is first with a simple, infuriating sentence: \u201cNear perfect.\u201d\n\nShe will not cry. Not in the technical, not over lamination, not while Celeste is in her peripheral vision like the blade of a guillotine she has decided is ornamental. She nods and breathes and Chews Like A Person On Television and shakes Arjun\u2019s hand and even dares to touch Celeste\u2019s elbow lightly, because she is a menace like that, and Celeste glances down at the place where Ro touched her as if wondering whether it will leave a mark you can photograph.\n\nThey are given the fifteen minutes to find dinner that always feels like being let out of school in the middle of winter, everyone running in coats they do not have time to fasten. The canteen puts out a curry that tastes like the cook misses someone and chopped an extra onion to distract herself, and everyone eats in the ravenous, guilty way camera people and bakers eat on set, alive to their own appetites in a way they cannot promise themselves on other days. The crew tries not to have favorites out loud and fails in tiny, human ways that make the tent work: an extra cup of tea placed by a hand that looks like it has been steady for forty years; a paper towel that appears at a moment when someone would have cried over a spill if someone had not handed them a way to not.\n\nThe Showstopper brief lands with the thump of a gift and an obligation. It is, as it should be, absurd: a multi-tiered centerpiece cake that tells the story of your year in four distinct layers, each with a different flavor profile and a different structural demand, with a decorative element that must be edible and must not be embarrassed to stand up in a room with people watching it. The blue-eyed judge says the word narrative in a way that suggests he does not object to it here because food can tell the truth and also look decent while doing it. The kind-eyed judge says, \u201cNo sugar props that will break if someone breathes near them,\u201d in what is clearly a rule made from experience, and eyes every sugar worker in the room, including Ro, until they nod.\n\nThis is where Ro has to make a decision not to narrate last year. The temptation is as seductive as a bowl of batter left alone with a spoon. Every cell in her wants to reference herself with a wink and a nod, to build a meta-cake that acknowledges she has done this already, that she knows where the cameras like to live. But she wrote herself a note weeks ago and underlined the imperative. This time, remember that you love it. She sketches the courthouse square cake, the tiered place where a small town makes its announcements, the limestone of it done in white chocolate ganache pulled with a palette knife, the colors of the seasons in syrups and jellies soaked into sponges you could mistake for clouds with better attitude. Spring lemon with thyme and poppy, summer corn with blackberry, autumn maple and smoke\u2014no, not smoke, that is a fad you subscribe to or don\u2019t and she is not wanting to taste campfire at her own wedding; autum maple and toasted pecan, winter spice with orange and a whisper of something that reminds you of heat even when there isn\u2019t any. The sugar element will be a river of glass running alongside, a narrow ribbon, not a cage, because cages break and make a person look like she loved difficulty for its own sake.\n\nShe goes back to the inn with her notebook and her blue apron folded in two and cannot sleep because sleep is for people not negotiating with themselves in two languages at once. She brings out the biscuit tin the judge slid into her hands when no one was looking and eats one, then two, then tells herself she is saving the third for a catastrophe and immediately eats it because she will not do performative restraint in a room with no witnesses. She writes one word in her notebook and circles it. Joy. She considers crossing it out because it scares her in a way she can\u2019t justify; she leaves it alone and goes to wash her hands because sugar on fingers is the one thing that can convince her to stop writing when writing is the closest she comes to prayer.\n\nMorning rises with a flat golden light that pretends to be kind. The tent welcomes them with that merciless mercy it has, everything laid out and nothing softened. There are cameras everywhere but the crew has the old kindness of looking away when you are trying not to throw up. Clare stands at the back with a clipboard like a general trying to remember the names of all her troops and pretending it is easy. The hosts arrive with coffee in cups that have the wrong names on them, because that is the joke. The judges glide in with the weight of expectation and sunscreen you can smell if you stand close enough. Ro puts the blue apron on under the production one and ties a knot she can undo with one pull if fires or feelings break out.\n\nBatter is easier than truth. She starts with winter at the base because she is contrary and because she wants to build up into spring, not down into it. Spice and orange go into sugar in a ratio that her grandmother would approve of and write a letter about. She beats butter until it forgets who it was. She creams until the mixture sighs. She whisks eggs until they stop falling apart and begin to hold each other. She folds without deflation. The cake tin is lined with a generosity that is practiced kindness, parchment where it needs to be and the tiniest whisper of oil where parchment is a hindrance. She slides it in and starts the next, the corn batter studded with flavor she will beat out of it if she is not careful, the blackberry that will bleed if she jostles it. She is a triage ward and a march. She rotates pans and watches the oven like a person who knows that even the good ovens have personalities and grudges.\n\nArjun builds gentler, a sort of orchard in tiers, apples and pears and soft ginger that smells like an apology and a promise all at once. His sugar work will be caramel lace, something that looks like winter grass under frost. He is whispering again, and if you stand close you hear the shape of a child\u2019s name in the air. Celeste is sculpting with a severity that wishes it were kindness. Her tiers are precise in a way that doors are precise when they close and lock, pistachio bitter balanced on rose that could go gauche and is saved by her good taste. Her decoration will be shards, because she is not afraid of edges, spun sugar pulled into a crown that will either stand like a statement of principle or collapse like a metaphor people will not be able to stop making.\n\nThe tent is a workshop of miracles and errors. Somewhere behind Ro a ganache splits and a baker chokes down a sob and a host descends like a benevolent demon with suggestions and a towel. Briefly, the sun comes out and shirts of people not on camera glow like soft flags. Ro levels layers with a blade that is the width of her own stubbornness, calculates the cooling time with a mathematician\u2019s arrogance and a cook\u2019s fatalism. The lemon syrup in the spring tier has an echo of last night\u2019s biscuits, and when she brushes it on she feels, not a memory, but a future she can have if she keeps surviving the present. The corn layer goes on a level that is so exacting someone would accuse her of using a spirit level if they didn\u2019t know she is simply obsessive and does not require tools once she has taught her eye to behave.\n\nThe kind-eyed judge, who has a gift for appearing when your hands are full and your mouth is free to make a joke that reminds you who you are, loiters by her bench as if she has several other benches to be interested in. \u201cYou\u2019ve decided against cages,\u201d she observes, delicate as a dentist asking whether you\u2019re flossing.\n\n\u201cCages and I had a falling out last season,\u201d Ro says, and the honesty of it lands with the same relief as laughter. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. I never liked them for you,\u201d the judge murmurs, and then catches herself and corrects to, \u201cfor anyone really,\u201d and the slip makes something warm crawl up Ro\u2019s throat like sugar coming to crack. \u201cThis river is sensible and pretty, and I say sensible as a compliment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I let use sensible as a compliment,\u201d Ro says, and the judge\u2019s hand does that small tapping thing near a spoon again, like a heart comforting itself. \u201cAre we allowed side deals, then? You bring me biscuits when I am about to ruin everything, and I will not build sugar prisons in which my cake can die.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only treaty I\u2019m signing this week,\u201d the judge says. Her smile crinkles where the world has been good to her. \u201cCarry on.\u201d\n\nStacking is a religion; you have to have faith in gravity and your own puny engineering. Ro dowels the bottom tier like a person who has built furniture in apartments too small for the furniture she built. She centers. She breathes. She curses once, quietly, because a smear of ganache went where good manners would forbid. She fixes it with a finger and a palette knife and the ruthless honesty of a person cleaning up her own mistakes. The second tier sits. The third. The top is small and pleased with itself, a hat she might wear to a wedding in a town that sells lemon biscuits in tins. The sugar river goes on last, thin and gleaming, tethered invisibly with dots of caramel she pretends are natural adhesion because she does not want to admit to herself that she has learned to lie a little with sugar. The bunting\u2014no, not bunting, too on the nose\u2014she sprinkles the edges with a dusting of powdered something that is not snow and is not sugar and is whatever the part of a year is that lets you sit on your porch in the heat and know life is ending all the time and that this is not an emergency.\n\nCeleste\u2019s crown wobbles and then rights itself with an arrogance that would be illegal in less tolerant countries. Arjun\u2019s caramel lace is a wound and a cobweb and a miracle, and he does not breathe until it sets its own mind. The hosts count them down with that unnatural brightness people use when time is a cliff.\n\n\u201cTime,\u201d the tent says in chorus, and hands go up again. This is a different lifting, a more final one, the sort that lets your armpits know you\u2019re alive. Ro drops hers and looks at what she has done and feels a thing she has not felt since the accident\u2014pride that isn\u2019t posturing. She even lets herself think the word beautiful without crossing it out in the margins of her mind.\n\nJudging is a slow walk, a promenade through the small chapters of other people\u2019s months. Arjun goes first. The knife goes through sponge and everyone in a five-foot radius-eavesdrops on the sound. His flavors are seasonally correct without trimming themselves into oblivion, and the kind-eyed judge calls his ginger polite in a tone that means it is perfectly mannered and also has a personality. Celeste stands like a statue as her cake is unmade with authority. The blue-eyed judge flicks through layers like a bird with taste deciding which branch to land on. He praises the bitterness in her pistachio the way a person praises a villain who made the movie better. He says her crown is ambitious and somehow both tells her he liked it and tells her ambition is not always her friend, and her face does that thing expensive faces do where they preserve themselves for later use.\n\nWhen they reach Ro, the air around the bench changes temperature. She thinks she must be imagining it until the fine hair on her arms reacts like a prairie in a sweep of wind. The judges do their ritual: the sight, the poke, the sniff that is a generosity and a judgment. The first slice is winter, and the spice comes up to meet them like a person who knows how to walk into a room and shake the correct hands. \u201cBalanced,\u201d the blue-eyed judge says, which is such lukewarm praise until you hear the emphasis he puts on the fact of it. The kind-eyed judge speaks first on maple: \u201cYou have no heavy hand,\u201d she says, dipped in something like affection. \u201cYou are not making me remember pancakes. Thank you for that.\u201d\n\nThe lemon layer is the last at the top, and Ro watches the knife go in and hears in her own skull a crack that is not anxiety but release. The zest is there, the thyme doing the job of herbs when herbs are not at a party where they will make a fool of themselves. The judges chew and there is a pause with shape. \u201cYou\u2019ve put yourself on a plate,\u201d the blue-eyed judge says finally, as if accusing her of a crime and forgiving her at the same time. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve not apologized for it.\u201d The kind-eyed judge has a look on her face Ro would like to frame and take home and hang above her couch where only she can see it. \u201cIt tastes,\u201d she says quietly, \u201clike you wanted to be here.\u201d\n\nFor a second the tent dissolves around the edges like a memory and reasserts itself like a fact. Ro nods because she cannot say anything else, and because she has spent months making the sound yes into a bridge and it is holding. She feels the spoon with the crescent burn mark on the bench behind her as a possibility and a problem she already solved. She feels Celeste\u2019s gaze like weather. She feels, under her layers of apron, the stitch of the blue fabric like a familiar hand at her spine, and she thinks, ridiculous and entirely accurate, that she loves this and is allowed to love it.\n\nThey line them up like suspects and lovers. The hosts do their jokes and then do their looking that isn\u2019t jokes. There is a speech about journeys that manages to avoid clich\u00e9 through sheer force of sincerity and because the people hearing it have flour in their hair. The decision lands where it lands. Arjun is given third with a tenderness that insists he has won something he\u2019ll get in the mail later and keep in his drawer near the good napkins. Celeste is second with an expression that would be dangerous if placed on a highway. She is too good to do anything but turn this into a plan. There is applause that is not polite; it is the applause people give to an argument well made even if they had staked money on the other side.\n\nRo is first, and it is not a coronation and it is not inevitable and it is not even a narrative, it is simply true in the way certain flavors are true in your mouth. The blue-eyed judge extends his hand with the weight of the world\u2019s oddest sacrament, and this is a new shake, not a remembrance, and she takes it and it is dry and human and less electric than legends would have you believe and also everything legends require. The kind-eyed judge puts her palm briefly to Ro\u2019s forearm, a touch so light a person who did not know human bodies would miss it, and says, \u201cWell done,\u201d like an entire chapter of a book.\n\nThe tent stands down. The air lets out. Someone somewhere cries in a bathroom for three minutes and composes themselves with paper towels and returns with a joke. A sound tech wraps their cables like pasta forks. Clare puts her head against a pole and therefore catches her breath because this is her cathedral and her gym. Arjun presses a sticky kiss to Ro\u2019s cheek and calls her sister and means it, and Ro returns the title and means it more than she expected to. Celeste lingers, which is not her habit unless she has intentions. She looks at Ro\u2019s blue apron peeking like a secret and says, in a tone that would get her away with anything, \u201cYou won last year. You won today. It must be boring being you.\u201d\n\nRo laughs because that is the only thing that will make this a conversation and not a speech. \u201cIt is never boring being a person who forgets winter and has to court lemon all over again,\u201d she says. \u201cYou should try it. Keeps things fresh.\u201d\n\nCeleste\u2019s mouth does not change, but the line from her temple to her jaw confess something. \u201cWe\u2019re not finished,\u201d she says, and it isn\u2019t a threat so much as a scheduling note. \u201cThere\u2019s more life.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Ro says, gentle and feral. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d\n\nLater, after the de-mic and the hug she pretends not to give to a host and the producers\u2019 congratulations that come in packets of compliments designed to avoid making her a person who will be unbearable to feed, she walks out into the field where the day has decided to be evening without a scene change. The tents look smaller when you step away; the bunting, now moving, makes a noise like the hem of a dress. The kind-eyed judge is out there too, unsurprised by her own presence outdoors, hands in the pockets of a jacket that has seen other seasons. They do that thing two people do when standing near each other would be a decision and standing apart feels like a story about caution that neither of them asked to tell.\n\n\u201cWalk?\u201d the judge offers, singular, the opposite of dangerous, and Ro says yes before thinking about what parts of the internet would make of a yes that is not about cake. They walk the length of a hedge that is more opinion than plant. A flock of birds does a motion that looks like thought. The judge tucks her hair behind her ear and says, as if she had been saving it for when there was grass under them and no camera lenses in the hedgerows, \u201cYou were very brave to come back.\u201d\n\nRo swallows. The lump is everything the day put in her throat that could not be swallowed at the time. \u201cI was very afraid to,\u201d she says, because the old habits of editing herself fall away out here where the syllables can go somewhere. \u201cI didn\u2019t come back on purpose. I think I tripped and landed here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how most of us end up anywhere decent,\u201d the judge says. Her smile is not a consolation. It is an admission. \u201cI cannot be anything but myself in that tent, which is unfortunate on certain days and fortunate on others. I am telling you this because it is maddening to be treated like weather when you are in fact a person who is always misplacing her reading glasses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not call you weather,\u201d Ro promises, and then hears what she has promised and wants to walk it back and does not. \u201cI will call you\u2014\u201d she stops, because names are power and also because she is not alone in this story even if it keeps pinning her to the center. \u201cI will call you kind and expect you to prove me right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the worst technical,\u201d the judge says, mostly to herself. She looks at Ro and something in her face goes more careful. \u201cYou will be all right,\u201d she adds, not like a palliative, like a dare.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ro says, and she does, briefly and then more fully and then briefly again, as truth comes in waves. She thinks she could say something foolish about lemon biscuits and rivers of sugar and maps, so she closes her mouth and lets the grass do some talking and lets the wind rattle the tent ropes and decides that chapter five of this particular book ends not with an oven door closing or a slow-motion bite, but with two people walking in a field pretending not to measure their steps to each other\u2019s.The field is a different country after the cameras leave, the grass scuffed into the pattern of a day and the ropes singing a low, private chord against the stakes. The tent sits there fatted with silence, like a creature that has eaten and is purring. Ro and the judge make it as far as the tree with the deliberate shade and stop because there is nothing beyond it but more of the same green in variations and the sense that if they kept walking, they would fall off the edge of the episode and into regular air. The judge\u2019s shoes sink a fraction into the soft earth and leave two careful ovals that will baffle a rabbit later. Ro presses her heel down and lifts it again, amused by the shape of her own tread, which looks like someone tried to stamp a direction into the ground and thought better of it.\n\n\u201cDo they make you go to the party,\u201d Ro asks, not because she doesn\u2019t know but because she wants to hear whether anyone else calls it that.\n\n\u201cThey make me,\u201d the judge says, and her mouth does that thing where it agrees and also you can tell she would go anyway. \u201cThere is a ritual speech about the magic of ordinary ingredients. There is a tray of sausages that always runs out in a way that suggests someone is siphoning them off to a secret sausage lair. There will be glasses. People will do that Mid-Atlantic shouting that is meant to be casual. You will try to be gracious and end up being you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could be worse,\u201d Ro says. \u201cI could start gin rants.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen gin rants,\u201d the judge says, grim authority in her eyes softened by what must be memory. \u201cI will fetch you before you get to that stage.\u201d\n\nThey turn back because they must. The tent grows in their peripheral vision like a promise that has already been kept, and the edges of the world go back to where the edges belong. Someone\u2019s child, who does not know about embargoes or the sacredness of footage, streaks across the lawn in a shirt with dinosaurs that grin like they have baked today and are good at it. Arjun sits on a camp chair that looks like it has been there since the first time someone put a tablecloth on a table and called it television, and he is on the phone leaning into a voice that makes his shoulders low and his face young. Celeste is a stillness leaned against a pole as if that is what poles are for, scrolling with the intensity of a person who thinks information is a resource you can mine until the seam gives. The production assistants move like a shoal, flicking tape and wires, giggling without apology. Clare, clipboard aloft like a censer, catches Ro\u2019s eye and tilts her chin toward the catering tent, which smells like meat and celebration and a mild disaster averted.\n\nThe party is what it always is, which is a group of tired people over-complimenting finger food to keep from over-complimenting each other until they break and do it anyway. There is a table for the crew with a sign that says crew and another table for the talent with a sign that says talent, and in twenty minutes no one will be observing those divisions. Ro allows herself, for a whole hour, to be carried on the fact of having done it without boring herself by recounting it. She nods in the rhythm of congratulations designed by people who have shaken many hands and would like to be at home with their socks off. Someone sets a beer in front of her that is lighter than she prefers, and someone else replaces it with something stout as if stout could be a bandage.\n\nArjun finds her with both hands out. His laugh has reverted to the cell-deep one that made her like him twenty seconds into knowing he existed. \u201cSister,\u201d he says, not looking to see whether anyone is listening for that intimacy. \u201cMy daughter is making me bring you home so she can test whether you are real. She insists whales will be part of this test. Prepare a whale fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am full of whale facts,\u201d Ro says, and then has to rummage. \u201cTheir earwax\u2014no, their earwax has layers and you can count the layers like rings in a tree to know their age.\u201d She sees him wince in delight and declares it a success. \u201cTell her Arjun\u2019s friend can be dated by pastry layers, though. Earwax is unromantic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll translate,\u201d he promises. Under the fairy lights his hair looks like the way old silver catches light. \u201cMy wife says when she saw you put your hand flat on the bench before you started, she knew you were going to be all right. She says that is how her grandmother used to calm herself before kneading. Palm down, hello wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a religion,\u201d Ro says, swallowing around something that would be sentiment if it dressed itself. \u201cI like your wife already.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will,\u201d he says, sure as physics.\n\nCeleste approaches the way a cat approaches a friend\u2019s dog it has decided to tolerate. She does not hold a drink, which is either discipline or a strategy to keep her hands available as punctuation. Her face is its usual essay of control and intent, but tonight there is a tiny unravel at the edge of her left eyebrow, as if an expression she didn\u2019t authorize has leaked out and spent itself. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d she says, and it could be acid and it is not. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend you didn\u2019t do something beautiful because politeness is an ugly dress on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d pay to see you pretend,\u201d Ro says. \u201cBut this is better.\u201d\n\nCeleste shifts, the small change you make when you decide not to defend a fortress. \u201cYou were softer this time,\u201d she says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t an insult. Your work was always clean, but you used to make it stand up and salute. Today it looked like you trusted it to be looked at.\u201d\n\nRo chews this as if it is food dense enough to reward chewing. \u201cI forgot some things,\u201d she says, wishing, for once, that she did not feel compelled to explain, and explaining anyway. \u201cThen I had to want them again without remembering why. I think it made my hands kinder to me.\u201d\n\nCeleste looks at the tent as if she might pick it up with both hands and tilt it. \u201cI liked you better when you were an idiot I could hate without consequence,\u201d she says, so flatly that Ro laughs. \u201cThis is very inconvenient. I\u2019m going to have to up my budget for therapy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll invoice you,\u201d Ro offers, and Celeste\u2019s mouth tips, and the look in her eyes is almost relief.\n\nThe judge circulates with the efficient benevolence of a host at a wedding for people who once burned sugar together. When she comes near Ro, she doesn\u2019t stop right away; she just lets her shoulder brush Ro\u2019s in a way that could be accident and is not. Later, she delivers the magic-of-ingredients speech with practiced humor and an unsentimental affection that makes the grip around Ro\u2019s sternum give, an eighth of an inch, which is a country mile if you are measuring from where she started. There is also a paragraph about good television having ethics, about editing as an act of respect, and Ro watches the crew watch her with the attention of apprentices who have chosen their masters with care.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone turn you into a brand you can\u2019t stand to eat,\u201d the judge says into her glass, and there it is: the line Ro writes down later inside her own skull where it can\u2019t be edited for a press release.\n\nBack at the inn the floorboards betray every future ghost with opinions. Ro\u2019s room smells faintly of party linger and fern. The blue apron is a folded sky at the foot of the bed, and the spoon with the crescent mark lies on the nightstand like a stubborn moon. She sits on the edge of the mattress and studies her hands like a fortune-teller who has already told herself the worst and is now trying to believe the good. The door knocks twice, fast, the way a postman might, which is why she knows it\u2019s Mina before she even crosses the room.\n\nThe phone screen ricochets her best friend\u2019s face into the dimness, makes it overbright. Mina is in Indiana night, with a mug and somebody else\u2019s cat on her shoulder like a high-collared cape. \u201cAre you alive,\u201d Mina demands, then swears with the relish of someone who delayed swearing for twelve hours and now has a backlog. \u201cAre you\u2014 are you okay? Do you need a plane I cannot afford to arrive and wrap you up and bring you home? Because I will commit crimes. They will be small crimes, but I will do them enthusiastically.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a cake,\u201d Ro says. It is not the answer to any question, and it is the only answer. \u201cI made a courthouse and didn\u2019t get arrested.\u201d\n\nMina narrows her eyes and then goes soft at the edges, which is how you know she is not pretending to be a velociraptor for the sake of her own entertainment. \u201cDo you feel like you now,\u201d she asks, carefully, as if the answer will rearrange the cabinets.\n\n\u201cI feel like a person with sugar under her nails and good applause in her ears who is going to sleep until the bus driver in the morning picks me up like a sack of flour,\u201d Ro says. \u201cI feel like I might let the apron hang on a hook when I get home. I feel like I am going to cry if I say the word winner in front of a mirror, and also I\u2019m not going to break. Does that count.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt counts for everything,\u201d Mina says, decisively, and the cat headbutts her chin like an endorsement. \u201cBloomington is already making rumors out of air. Harriet says fifty-seven people asked her if she knows whether you made something controversial with corn. I told her the only controversial thing you ever did with corn was steal a bag of kettle corn off a raccoon at the fair and win. I have never loved you more. Call me in the morning so I can yell at you about airport sandwiches.\u201d\n\nRo promises because promising is how you make paths across days. Before bed she unfolds the blue apron and hangs it on the wardrobe knob and watches it take up its small jurisdiction and feels the crazy, sane sense that she has hung part of last year back up in her life where it belongs. She opens the biscuit tin to find the paper liner, now mostly crumbs, gaudy with sugar and the wet gleam of lemon oil. She licks one finger and picks up a grain the size of resolution. Sleep comes fast and keeps a hand on the small of her back like a person shepherding her toward the door of morning.\n\nThe morning makes itself plain with English light and a knock that means the driver is on time and a polite voice on the stairs announcing that luggage has opinions. Ro packs with the ruthless tenderness of someone storing relics. The spoon is getting cocky about being a symbol; she tucks it in on top of the A to Z of London she bought for no reason other than that maps make her feel capable. She folds the blue apron and places it with the engraved whisk, and when her fingers brush the letters they hum with the quiet bell of permanence. She leaves a note for housekeeping that says thank you in small neat cursive and an extra thanks for the nice soap because kindness to the cleaners is a family rule that never expires.\n\nAt the field there are goodbyes that pretend not to be goodbyes, clapped shoulders and the exchange of numbers written down in three places so you do not have to pretend later you cannot find them. Arjun hugs her like he trusts she will not break him with the force of it, and his eyes are damp because he is a person who carries salt water like it is useful. \u201cCome to Cardiff,\u201d he says. \u201cI will make you eat Welsh cakes until you cry for mercy, and then my aunt will come over to insist on a second round. Bring Mina or we will talk about her until you feel guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am terrified of your aunt and also in love with her,\u201d Ro says, which is a fair review of many aunts.\n\nCeleste does not hug. She steps close enough that their shoulders nearly become one body and says, \u201cDo not become a story someone else tells about themselves at your expense.\u201d It is a gift wrapped like a threat. \u201cAlso, when you come to New York, call me. Do not show up without warning; I will forgive you and then never let you forget you were uncivilized.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you accept offerings,\u201d Ro asks. \u201cI can bring pie.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you bring pie I will stab you with a fork and then feed it to you,\u201d Celeste says, like poetry.\n\nClare appears the way leaders appear, suddenly and in the place where you need them. She tucks a folded paper into Ro\u2019s palm, something that looks bureaucratic and is not, and squeezes once like a semaphore for good weather. \u201cYour embargo email will be waiting for you by the time you land,\u201d she says. \u201cDo the opposite of what your heart wants for six weeks and tell no one the important thing. We will send you back here for a pickup if we must change one microscopic shot of your hand whisking. You were a joy and a schedulable adult. We love schedulable adults. Please do not forget to drink water for the remainder of your natural life.\u201d\n\nOn the way to the airport, hedges reassert themselves as the continents of this nation. The driver has a radio show on where people phone in to confess crimes committed by baked potatoes. Ro stares out at the versions of green and tries to fit herself back into the container of a person who is going to sit in the sky for seven hours. In the seat pocket she finds a safety card and imagines herself drawing a lemon on it where the diagram says pull. She closes her eyes and sees not cameras, not bunting, not even the judge\u2019s mouth or the blue eye\u2019s half-smile; she sees a slab of limestone warmed by sun and cool under her palm, a building that looks like a courthouse and insists it is a bakery, and a maple leaf turning its face to the light like what else is it for.\n\nAirports are cruel to glory. She is grateful. She buys a terrible sandwich and holds it as if it is a necessary sin. She texts her mother from the gate, a sentence that is half code and half shout. Made four layers and didn\u2019t die, she types. Lemon is no longer a war. I am bringing home biscuits that don\u2019t exist. Her mother writes back with the exact number of exclamation points her mother would use to tell someone about a grandson\u2019s good haircut, then follows with a photo of the antique shop staging a small parade of ceramic geese near the register. The geese are wearing ribbon. One goose has a tiny paper crown on its head that says RO in minuscule block letters. The caption is unpunctuated and magnificent: your kingdom awaits.\n\nOn the plane the universe goes white, then black, then blue. The hum buoys her in that way that makes you feel both inconsequential and exempt. She opens the notebook to a page near the back and writes a letter to herself because letters have become the way she saves her own life without making a fuss. Dear Ro, it begins, as if she were someone else. Today you put lemon back in your mouth and it didn\u2019t bite. Today you did not make a prison and call it a showpiece. Today you asked your hands to remember you and they did. If you forget again, you are allowed. The ribbon in the tin was yellow. The judge\u2019s kindness is not policy, it is a person. Do not kiss pictures. Eat breakfast. When you get home, hang up the apron. Leave the spoon on the stove. Let winter in when it arrives, and be friends with it if you can.\n\nNewark smells like a mall that married an airplane. She thinks she sees a man from Bloomington who sells knives on Saturdays at the farmer\u2019s market, and it is not him, and it makes her laugh enough she looks like a very cheerful lunatic. The Indianapolis flight is crowded with people who have never baked on television and do not care to hear about it. There is a child in the row behind her who kicks the seat with the singular conviction of tiny children and drummers, and she almost turns to ask him for a rhythm to whisk to and then thinks better of it because she is tired and kindness has to bring its own sauce or it dries out.\n\nBloomington is the word her heart says under its breath when it wants to feel like something fits. Mina is at the airport because of course she is, and Theo has found a way to stand directly in the path of baggage as if it will not force him to move. Harriet is not there because Harriet believes in the theater of the unexpected; instead there is a note on Ro\u2019s front door when she gets to it later that says Keys. Passport. Forgiveness. Hothouse tomatoes, half price. The maple has gone gold in places and green in others, undecided like a teenager growing hips. The porch swing is a sulk; it has missed her and has chosen to show it by making more noise than it needs to.\n\n\u201cYou look like someone who got in a fistfight with a cloud,\u201d Mina says, and wraps her in a hug that resets the hinges on Ro\u2019s ribs. \u201cDid you bring me anything illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought you international crumbs,\u201d Ro says, and Mina takes the biscuit tin with reverence and places it on the table as though it refuses to be empty. \u201cI also brought you an entire country\u2019s opinion about pastry. We can ignore it if we want.\u201d\n\nThey do not talk about who won, which is the small hard miracle of discipline. They talk instead about the lady at the clay studio who said the word kiln like it had killed her husband. They talk about Theo\u2019s coach deciding the pool is flirting with algae, as if algae has coyness. They talk about a raccoon who has discovered the diner\u2019s dumpster and is making it his work to embarrass them. They eat eggs because eggs are both breakfast and apology. Ro touches the hook by the door with the back of her finger and then hangs the blue apron there, slow as faith.\n\nThat first week stretches and contracts like dough under the hand. The embargo sits on her tongue like a bead of sugar not yet melted, dangerous only if you are careless. The town senses a weather event and pretends to be blas\u00e9. People tip more and ask less. Hank sprays down tables with theatrical righteousness and mutters something about the paparazzi, and a woman at the counter whose hair has known three decades of peroxide says, as she pins a lottery scratch-off to the corkboard, that her nephew\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s cousin swears they saw Ro shaking a famous hand and that this means Indiana is going to be on the map and that the map should be pink. Ro pulls a croissant sheet and says, \u201cWe have always been on a map,\u201d and the woman considers this the way you consider whether a hat is your color and decides to buy it.\n\nHer mother drives over on Thursday with a bag of pears that smell like regret and sugar. She stands in the kitchen doorway and watches the apron on the hook as if it might introduce itself. Ro pulls out the box from under the bed even though the items in it have been redistributed, and they sit on the floor like teenagers, picking over the remains of an era that is simultaneously ongoing and old. They take the photograph out again, and this time they both look at it until their eyes stop being wet. They let the word winner sit between them like a bowl on a table. It doesn\u2019t drown them; it is less deep and more steady than they were prepared for. Her mother says, \u201cI kept trying to fit the year into a coat you would want to wear. It is a difficult size,\u201d and Ro leans her head on her mother\u2019s knee like a child who will not apologize for being a child in her mother\u2019s house.\n\nThey start saying last year out loud. It makes a difference. It moves the last winter from the drawer under the towels into the cupboard with the mugs. The smell of lemon in the diner stops being a knife and becomes a practice. She uses thyme twice in one day and no one breaks their own heart. Mina comes back from the clay studio with the loaf-shaped mug fired into a permanent smile and puts it on the shelf by the window where the light can enter it. The mug looks like an object that will save someone\u2019s life by being the correct size for their hand.\n\nThe show will air in a few weeks, and then the town will have another party, and then a different one. There will be phone calls with producers and a calendar that suggests Ro knows how to be in two places at once and a publicist somewhere who attempts to train her to say three phrases in interview like a minor magic trick. The judge will send one perfect sentence to her inbox that says, Without sugar, but you, and Ro will read it once and then put her phone face down and go stack chairs at closing because weight and repetition have always made more sense to her than anyone\u2019s idea of fate.\n\nCeleste texts a photo of a pastry box tied with red string and the words You are not allowed to eat this until you admit defeat at Scrabble, which settles the question of what kind of friends they are going to be. Arjun sends a voice note of his daughter listing sea creatures in a serious voice that makes every word its own entity. Harriet installs a tiny bell under the hook with the blue apron so it rings when someone tries to steal it, and there are attempts which are thwarted by the sound of foolishness ringing true.\n\nAt night Ro sits on the porch with the maple donating privacy and the cricket choir bringing their long song. She writes again, because paper is how she keeps track of the parts of herself that will argue if left alone in the back. She begins with a recipe and keeps going after the ingredients are done because it feels like something useful. Butter, she writes, and does not put a quantity. Sugar, she writes, and adds patience. Eggs, she writes, and adds don\u2019t overtalk them. Flour, she writes, and adds what you have in the cupboard. Lemon, she writes, and adds courage. Thyme, she writes, and adds what love really is; you add it to the end and it changes the whole thing.\n\nThe maple releases a leaf with the exact theatrics of a person finishing a solo. Somewhere in the town, someone flips through channels and will one day stop because they see a familiar person in a white tent with a spoon that has a crescent burn. Somewhere else, someone will taste corn in cake and write an email using words Ro will not recognize and will keep anyway because keeping kindness is polite. In her kitchen, the apron hangs and does not accuse anyone. The whisk waits for morning. The oven will want to be fed. The air is sweet because Bloomington has forgiven everything that can be forgiven and is saving the rest in jars. Ro stands up because the night is a chapter break. She rinses a bowl because she is not a monster. She goes to bed knowing the exact taste of lemon on a good day and thinks, finally, the same thought the tent made her have until it stuck: some things rise even if you aren\u2019t looking. Some things rise because you are.The week before the episode airs, Bloomington behaves like a person about to sneeze. Conversations begin with ordinary news and end with glances that try not to say anything, which is how you know they\u2019re saying everything. Hank invents new methods of wiping down tables that all culminate in him leaning on the counter and asking whether the legal term embargo is Latin for suffering. Harriet prepares for a watch party while insisting there will be no party, then orders twice as much coffee as usual and pretends it is because bean shipments have their own weather. Theo stops by between practices under the pretext of returning a mug he definitely stole and leaves a bag with swimmer snacks and a note that reads for your nervous system and also your mouth, which is almost poetry.\n\nThe mug from ceramics night comes back from the kiln like a small miracle that kept its promises. The glaze is the exact wrong beige suddenly right in this shape, warm and bread-ish, with a darker brown pooled where the scores are, like a loaf has blushed. Mina presents it with the gravity of a midwife and sets it on the counter where the light can put its hand inside. Ro picks it up and discovers her fingers fall into the grooves she cut without thinking, and the contact steadies her faster than any pep talk. She pours coffee into it that tastes like the middle of the alphabet and drinks standing up, because sitting is a negotiation she will lose.\n\nHer mother drives over two days before air with a cake she calls emergency and says is not what you think. It is dense and lemon-scented without being lemon, and it holds up to frosting like a person who does not wilt easily. They sit at the kitchen table with the cake between them and the blue apron on the hook like a flag hung at half mast for a private holiday. Her mother says, \u201cMy friend Irene asked if the show will show the handshake,\u201d and Ro says, \u201cIf it does, I won\u2019t look at my face,\u201d and her mother says, \u201cI will look at your face for you in case it does anything rude,\u201d and this, too, is a family tradition masquerading as a new idea.\n\nRo cleans, because cleaning is a language she speaks fluently when other languages fail. The walk-in gleams. The flour bin shines with a thin coat of powder that will always return no matter how many cloths you seek out to exile it with. She organizes the spice drawer with precision bordering on satire, lines the jars like soldiers, put cumin next to coriander to keep its world view in check, and stores the thyme in front where she can see it. She says the word out loud once, to test it. It has stopped being the name of a plant and started being an instruction, which is not unlike faith.\n\nThe embargo is a pebble she keeps under her tongue to remind herself not to overshare. People throw questions like children throw bread to ducks\u2014small, well-intended, a little greedy. She ducks or opens her mouth and lets crumbs dissolve harmlessly. When someone asks at the farmers market, \u201cDid you get to keep any of the equipment,\u201d she laughs and tells them the tent is a dragon who sleeps on its hoard and bites thieves. When a child asks, serious and unblinking, \u201cDid it smell like cookies the whole time,\u201d she says, \u201cIt smelled like nerves and lemon and electricity and yes,\u201d and the child nods, satisfied, and goes back to a carrot as if carrots were chapters in a book that cannot be put down.\n\nOn the day, Grackle\u2019s is full by an honest accident that fools no one. People show up with excuses like \u201cI always eat here at eight\u201d and \u201cmy cousin said the biscuits taste better when televised.\u201d Harriet proclaims this a fire hazard and brings out extra chairs, which is how you know it\u2019s love. Mina hangs a banner that reads nothing, actually nothing, just a row of blue triangles, because words have been outlawed for the day. Hank makes popcorn the way a marching band plays a fight song, with unnecessary volume and a conviction that keeps the air from doing anything tragic. Theo arrives with a small cooler that turns out to be full of ice and fear, which they agree to share.\n\nThe television on the wall has never looked so official. Someone pins a tea towel over the corner of the screen to hide the channel logo because no one wants to get caught accidentally doing a brand deal. The volume is set low enough that the diner can keep being a diner around it. The first shots ripple. There is the field in England pretending to be every field at once. There are tents that have faces if you look long enough. There are hands you recognize before you recognize your own chins. There are the judges, and the hosts, and then there is the roster of finalists with their names blooming in the bottom third, and the room does that thing where it gets both louder and quieter, as if sound has found a way to spread and behave.\n\nRo watches herself arrive, which is a special kind of magic trick. The editing is kind. It remembers she is funny without turning her into a joke, and it lets her quiets have their shape. The spoon with the crescent burn mark gets a close-up that makes the diner murmur like a small congregation. Mina elbows her with a gentleness practiced over two decades and whispers, \u201cYou are televisually tolerable,\u201d which is Mina calling you the queen. Her mother texts at the exact moment the lemon tarts come into frame and says, on a delay that feels like a blessing, your hands look like home.\n\nThere is a moment, during the Signature, when the camera lingers on her face as the lemon curd sets. On the screen, her expression swims. She looks concentrations of a woman who forgot something and is trying to remember it with fruit. Watching herself look like that makes the actual her feel the old flinch at the base of her skull, then watch it pass without catching. The room clucks in unison when the judge calls the thyme not-shouting, as if the judge speaks directly to the communal part of their Midwestern soul. When he says excellent with a mouth that resists adjectives, there is a flash of pride so large and ridiculous that Ro holds the edge of the table so as not to float.\n\nShe does not prepare for how it feels to watch the Technical, because you cannot rehearse and also you cannot be told. The editors make a symphony of butter and time. Celeste is sharp and beautiful and sharp again. Arjun\u2019s whispered Welsh is subtitled and becomes a chorus. Ro\u2019s thumbprints on the dough corners are caught by a camera that loves them more than she knew it could. When they lift the towel and her name lands on the first marker, there is applause that makes the windows vibrate and a noise from her mother that sounds like a kettle announcing a boil. Ro laughs and hides her face and then makes herself unhide her face, because she has worked too hard to disappear when the good happens.\n\nThe showstopper is a cathedral sliced. Seeing the courthouse square come together in edited time is like watching magic claim it has always been science. The corn layers look like what she wanted them to look like in a way that does not make sense, and the sugar ribbon is thinner on TV than in her memory, which is lucky. The judges say what they said, but the edit also captures the moment when the kind-eyed judge\u2019s hand hovered near Ro\u2019s wrist. It is visible only if you are looking for it and impossible to unsee once you know it\u2019s there. Mina sees it. Mina squeezes Ro\u2019s knee under the table and does not turn to look at her, which is how you get away with being loyal in public.\n\nThere is a sound in the diner that has never occurred here before, a collective breath held like a plate you do not want to drop. The handshake arrives new\u2014the second first one of her life\u2014and even on screen, even under careful cameras, it looks like two people decided to be proud of the same thing for one full second. Harriet does the thing where she pretends to drop a spoon so she can bend and hide her face and take a breath. Hank says a word under his breath that is not appropriate for a family establishment and then says, louder, \u201cI am so proud of our croissant dad,\u201d and Theo covers his face with his hands like a goalie who has just realized the ball is a cake.\n\nBloomington is the happiest kind of loud. The applause breaks seem to invent themselves. People clap at shots of corn as if corn is the protagonist of the season. They clap when the bunting ripples. They clap for Arjun piping and bake patience and for Celeste\u2019s crown, because they are not petty with their praise even if they mutter later that her hair does look like a knife. Someone starts a chant that fizzles because this is not that kind of town, and it turns into laughter so genuine even the griddle seems to blush. Ro surfaces between tidal surges of attention like a person learning to breathe in a slightly different climate. She lets the noise pass over her because fighting it is a waste of arms.\n\nAfter the credits crawl by like slow boats, the diner does the thing families do: everyone makes too much of nothing for five minutes to avoid having to say big things. Coffee is poured into cups that are already full. Someone declares the popcorn revolutionary. A man at the counter whose usual topic is auto parts adverts says, \u201cI always thought sugar work was frivolous, but those shards could have cut a pipe,\u201d and looks embarrassed when he realizes he sounds impressed. The geese in the antique shop photo have their little RO crown passed from phone to phone, and the crown grows fifteen percent with every retelling. Ro grins until her face hurts and then keeps at it, because the muscle knows now how certain aches are good.\n\nWhen the crowd thins and the mop bucket comes out like a chaperone enforcing curfew, Ro slips out the side door to where the alley meets the lot and the maples along the alley draw lines against the night. The air is cooling into something she can stand close to without being burned by the day in it. She leans her shoulder against the brick and rests her head back and considers whether she can feel her heartbeat in the mortar. She can. She tries the sentence out loud because the alley is a better confidant than the bathroom and because hearing herself say things has turned out to be practical magic. \u201cI did it again,\u201d she says, and then adds, \u201cI did it,\u201d in case again is too heavy.\n\nMina appears the way cats appear when you are trying to feel a feeling alone and need supervision. She has a beer in one hand and two cookies in the other, and she hands Ro one like slow medicine. \u201cIf you run, I\u2019m going to chase you,\u201d she says, pressing her shoulder where Ro\u2019s shoulder is. \u201cI brought my sensible shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running,\u201d Ro says. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014processing.\u201d\n\n\u201cProcessing is running with good posture,\u201d Mina declares. She takes a sip from the bottle and makes a face because the beer is the wrong kind of wrong and that offends her. \u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuiet,\u201d Ro says, surprised and not. \u201cThere was a moment when I saw me seeing the lemon and thought I might sprint into traffic. Then I didn\u2019t. The TV threw me a biscuit across time, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cKinky,\u201d Mina says, and then does not make the obvious joke, for which Ro is grateful. \u201cYou were beautiful in there. Not like, cover shoot, though you can do that too. I mean the kind of beautiful when someone is holding joy like they finally got instructions.\u201d\n\nRo nods and keeps her eyes on the little lake of oil near the dumpster that always looks like a galaxy. \u201cWhen she said it tasted like I wanted to be there,\u201d she says, \u201cI thought, okay. If I can\u2019t keep much else, I can keep that wanting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get to have more than wanting,\u201d Mina says. \u201cYou get to have doing. And done.\u201d She taps the cookie against Ro\u2019s cookie like a toast. \u201cAlso, there\u2019s a small woman at your table who will not leave until she speaks to you about your corn usage, and I am not a bouncer even if I own a jacket that makes me look like a bouncer. Come inside and let her love you with too much enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nThey go, and Ro survives four more compliments and a photo with a baby who sleeps through the flash like a grown-up. She stands at the register after close counting tips with Harriet because this is one way to unfloat, and Harriet fits bills into neat piles with the same energy she would devote to mediation or the careful rescue of a spider. \u201cYour mother cried into my egg salad,\u201d Harriet reports, looking pleased in a way that means she will never admit to being pleased. \u201cIt is fine; it needed salt. I am calling the food distributor tomorrow and yelling in a loving tone about tofu, because that is how I celebrate.\u201d\n\nIn the days that follow, the internet remembers where Bloomington is, and Bloomington pretends to be unimpressed. People who once posted photos of their cats now post pictures of their televisions paused on Ro\u2019s face with captions like our baker and I knew her when and I taught her eighth grade math except this is a lie and we met at a garage sale. Celeste posts a carousel of behind-the-scenes shots with a rare photo of her laughing that looks less like a sharp thing and more like a person who was told a joke by someone who meant it. Arjun\u2019s daughter writes WHALE FACTS in marker on a piece of paper and holds it up in a video where she lists the names of whales like a litany and adds Rosa as if that is one.\n\nAn envelope arrives at the diner two mornings after airing with a London stamp and handwriting that has gotten away with being elegant by being illegible. Inside there is a recipe card written in the kind-eyed judge\u2019s compact script on a clean, serious card. The title at the top reads Lemon Biscuits, Saunders Family, and below it the ingredients and a note that says, in parentheses, add thyme if you\u2019re in that mood, and under the line about zest, an instruction in a crooked arrow: You are not obligated to flinch. At the bottom, a postscript drawn in a box says: Without sugar, but you. Ro puts the card in her notebook and does not read it again for two days because she has the superstition that if she reads it three times the words will evaporate.\n\nCeleste sends a box tied with red string not two hours later, as if she has a tracker on the judge\u2019s mailbox. Inside are four pastries that are identical and an aggressive note that reads If you admit in good faith that I beat you at pistachio, I will come to your town and let you beat me at corn. There is also a Scrabble tile bag. Ro texts back a photograph of the loaf mug, full of coffee, with the box in the background and the note propped against the handle like a pennant. She writes Bring your fork. Don\u2019t bring your knives. Celeste\u2019s typing bubble appears and disappears as if she is negotiating with herself about what counts as flirting.\n\nIn the late afternoons when the humidity goes out to smoke and the light gets honest, Ro takes the recipe card out onto the porch and copies it in her own hand. She says the measurements like a poem. She bakes the biscuits at midnight when the oven can be the only loud thing in the room, and the smell wakes up the upstairs neighbor and a raccoon which has learned to sit politely by the door and pretend it is a cat. She puts a plate in the fridge for her mother with a sticky note that reads do not be reasonable about how many you eat, and another for Harriet labeled tell no one. The third plate she sets on her own table and eats standing up, then sitting, then with her elbows on her knees, letting the lemon go through her without an argument.\n\nHer memory does not come back with trumpets. It has no interest in narrative tidiness. What happens is she reaches for a whisk and her hand remembers a rhythm it liked, and she counts to the right number without knowing why. She passes a display of candied citrus in the grocery and her body does not stiffen. She smells bleach and thinks of a tent her brain insists on populating with bunting, but the thought does not knock her down. When she wakes up late on a Tuesday having dreamed of being on camera and wearing the wrong shoes, she puts her feet on the floor and the panic refuses to sit in her lap. She understands, with a mix of relief and resignation, that this is how most things mend: the scab forms, and you want to pick it, and you don\u2019t, and one day you notice skin where there was not skin. The scar is a fact; it is not an argument.\n\nBusiness doubles. People want corn tarts now and lemon with thyme like a dare they think they can win. Ro raises prices a dollar on anything that involves butter because the world is the world, and apologizes with an extra cookie you didn\u2019t order. She starts a Saturday morning class she calls \u201cI Will Not Let You Burn Sugar\u201d and fourteen strangers show up with their hair tied back and their eyebrows threaded with skepticism and leave with jars of amber they hold like newborns. She teaches them to kinesthetically know hard crack from soft ball and says, \u201cYou\u2019ll hear the change in pitch,\u201d and they believe her and then they hear it and they shout like children at a parade. She begins to believe in the usefulness of being watched when you are doing something well.\n\nHer inbox is a forest. Brands ask her to hold things next to her face and smile. A cooking magazine wants to fly her to a city she has never loved and wants her to pretend it is her favorite place and to say a line about butter that someone else wrote. A publisher wants to know if she has feelings about writing a thing between two covers that will sit in kitchens and sop up soup. The judge writes once, briefly, on paper as if paper were harder to fake. It is a note about aprons and hooks and a joke that is not for anyone but them, which does something to Ro\u2019s sternum that feels like being handed a very small glass animal and asked not to break it. She writes back on notebook paper with rounded corners and tells her about a mug and a raccoon and an alley galaxy. She signs it with her name and a P.S. that says If you put thyme in the biscuits, I will, too. There is a world in which this is nothing; Ro is living in the parallel world where it is a month of good weather.\n\nOne afternoon, three weeks into being a person the internet remembers, a car with New York plates parks crooked outside the diner and Celeste walks in with a box and sunglasses the size of confidence. She has a haircut even sharper than before and a jacket that costs an apology. Bloomington looks at her with the polite curiosity of people who will google later and pretend they did not. Celeste puts the box on the counter, slides onto a stool, and orders coffee like she invented java and is bored of her own invention. She looks at the apron on its hook and says, \u201cBlue suits you,\u201d without malice, which makes the compliment mean something, and ducks when Hank brandishes a spray bottle and declares, \u201cNew York! We do not allow fancy here unless it tips,\u201d because he cannot help himself.\n\nThey play Scrabble in the late afternoon after the lunch rush has deflated like a pie with too many aspirations. Celeste places words like knives, and Ro counters with agricultural terms and a frankly vulgar anagram that makes Celeste laugh so hard she almost tips her chair. They split the series and call it a draw. Then Celeste opens the box and pulls out four pastries she has named after verbs and makes them sit next to one another like sisters, and Ro brings out a corn tart that is not the final one but is its cousin, and they trade without commentary. They eat like people who understand that criticism is love in disguise and say true things with tiny bites and the occasional hand to chest because a crumb did the right thing. It is as sweet and dangerous as any of the editing choices a producer can make.\n\nWhen evening lays itself down on the town, Celeste stands on the sidewalk and squints up at the maple as if it will reveal narrative. \u201cI thought I would come to yell and leave,\u201d she says, as if that would surprise anyone. \u201cBut your shampoo smells like rosemary and your brother is absurd and your town treats me like a benign weather event, and now I have to go home and admit human feelings to my therapist. I hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am, inconveniently,\u201d Ro says. \u201cStay for pancakes tomorrow and let my mother tell you about the emergency cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will steal your emergency cake recipe and rebrand it,\u201d Celeste replies. She touches Ro\u2019s shoulder as if to bless, as if to anchor, as if unsure which category of touch this belongs to. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a pop-up,\u201d she says, suddenly all business again, because that is her chariot. \u201cMy place in November. Corn and bitterness. Maple and restraint. Pistachio and apology. It will be a theme.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring whales,\u201d Ro says, and Celeste\u2019s mouth shapes around the word whale like a person trying not to grin and failing.\n\nThe judge is a slower orbit, not because she is aloof, but because she is careful with the frequency of her gravity. They exchange envelopes like neighbors leaning over fences, with weather reports and recipes and an occasional ticket stub taped to a page with unreliable glue. When a charity event comes up in December, the email arrives with three sentences and a PS that makes Ro sit down and put her head on her arms. It reads, in its entirety: We do a bake for the hospice every year. It is small, important, and I am shameless. Will you come. We will not film it. The PS says: You will freeze. Bring the blue apron as an extra layer; it looks warm.\n\nThe day she buys the ticket for London in her own browser, without a production company behind it, she thinks for a long time about the way choices now braid with last year\u2019s accidents. There is always the question of who owes whom when it comes to joy. She decides, in the end, that there are debts you pay with showing up. She sends a photo of her confirmation to Mina with a caption that reads field trip, and Mina replies with an image of herself in three scarves and a note that says I am coming in your pocket as a heating pad. Her mother texts the lemon biscuit recipe with the thyme addendum circled in red and an arrow that reads put this in your suitcase.\n\nBetween now and then, there are weeks where it is enough to be Ro from the diner. She burns one tray of biscotti and does not take it as an omen. She figures out how to say no to a sponsored post about canned frosting with a diplomacy that makes Harriet raise an eyebrow in admiration. She sits on her porch with her feet on the swing and watches the maple change its mind slowly and then all at once. She makes a list titled winter armor and includes under it mittens, courage, cash for cab because lungs, lemon biscuits, enough sleep, and lets Mina add glitter and Celeste add red lipstick and Her Own Name underlined twice. The world gets colder at its edges and sweeter at its middle, as if dessert is the defense against the long dark. She writes herself a note and tucks it into the pocket of the blue apron for later: If you forget, ask the dough. It remembers you. It will again.",

                              "content": "The morning light in Bloomington has a habit of chewing through blinds and woodgrain and eyes, then softening like a secret. When the light reaches the corner booth at Grackle\u2019s Diner, the same corner where Rosa \u201cRo\u201d Avery is rolling out laminated dough, it turns the flour into halos and the baker into some kind of dusty saint. Ro smirks at the thought. Saint of stray croissants, patron of coffee refills and the twin gods of butter and heat.\n\nShe\u2019s got her hair shaved on the sides and left longer on top, dark as a crow and slicked back with something that smells faintly of rosemary. The regulars call her \u201ckid\u201d even though she\u2019s thirty-two and built like she could bench-press the espresso machine. Her forearms carry the story in pale scars and the faint ink lines from an old tattoo that everyone misreads as thunderclouds but is actually a stylized loaf, scored and opening like a book.\n\n\u201cRo!\u201d Hank hollers, leaning in from the dish pit. Hank is nineteen and always wet. \u201cWe out of jam.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d Ro says. She pats the dough. \u201cMomentum and jam: endless.\u201d\n\nHank raises his dish glove like a flag. \u201cNo, like, actually.\u201d\n\nRo points with her chin at the walk-in. \u201cBack left. Behind the vats. Don\u2019t drown.\u201d\n\nHank disappears. The bell over the door tinkles and brings in a sliver of cold that smells like rain and wet asphalt. Ro rolls. The laminated dough catches the light and she thinks of a meadow, the geologic layers of pastry that patience makes. She has always been a doer. She has recently become a listener to absences.\n\nIt started in late spring, the van sliding across gravel on a Sunday when she was on her way to Shelbyville to pick up a secondhand oven a friend swore was a bargain and would change her life (it did, but not in the way). The back wheel caught in a slick, the van fishtailed, a sound like God coughing and the windshield spidering into a spider\u2019s acres of web. The doctor said concussion. The MRI said nothing dramatic. Her days afterward said: something missing. Names she knew, highways she could trace with her thumbs closed, recipes she could make in sleep. But then there were bafflements: a gap where last winter should be, an echo where the end of October used to be, then January just... leaps. She woke up in March with strange muscle memory in her hands and a tiny flinch when she smelled lemon curd.\n\nFor months, she has moved like a person sorting the drawer where all the miscellaneous items go. Every day you pick something up and are not quite sure how or why you own it. And yet you do.\n\n\u201cRo,\u201d Mina says, sliding onto the counter with the grace of a cat that has read books about etiquette and chosen to ignore them. She is wearing a shirt with a hand-drawn comet on it and jeans with one knee repaired by a constellation of tiny stitches. Mina has been Ro\u2019s best friend since a summer in seventh grade when they broke into the pool after a thunderstorm and dared each other to jump. Ro has always jumped.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sit there,\u201d Ro says. \u201cIt\u2019s where people imagine they invented brunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came bearing news.\u201d Mina waggles her phone, which is wrapped in cracked plastic but still clings to life. She shoves it toward Ro with her elbows. \u201cFirst, the university cancelled the outdoor film festival because the projector swallowed a wasp. Second, the IU art museum is doing a ceramics night, and they will let you make a mug shaped like a loaf of bread. Third, you got an email.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I,\u201d Ro says without looking. The dough sighs under the pin and the room warms. \u201cFrom who? The governor? The NSA?\u201d\n\nMina makes her eyes wide. \u201cThe Bake Off people.\u201d\n\nRo stops rolling. The silence is a neat, exact thing, like when a TV is muted and everyone keeps moving. She does not lift her head. She slides the pin forward once, brings it back again, and then sets it down. The table breathes flour. She leaves white fingerprints on Mina\u2019s phone and taps into the inbox without reading the subject line.\n\nThe subject line is just: An invitation.\n\nHer heart does something indecorous. She opens it. The font is friendly. There\u2019s a logo she recognizes in a way that hurts a distant part of her, as if she has seen it under lights. Dear Rosa Avery, the email says. We\u2019re delighted to invite you to join the Final in this season of Bake Off. Due to a last-minute opening, we would be honored to have you in our tent. Please confirm availability, etcetera.\n\nRo stares long enough that Mina takes the phone back and scans it again. \u201cHoly sugar,\u201d Mina says, and because Mina respects the diner's air like a church, she does not cuss. \u201cIt\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nRo laughs. It\u2019s a bark, then something like relief or terror. \u201cIt\u2019s a prank.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmail addresses don\u2019t prank like that,\u201d Mina says, tap tap on the sender. \u201cLook, it\u2019s official. Also, they want you there in, like, a week. Ro, they want you to go on television. The television. The tent. The enormous mixing bowl. The soggy bottoms. You love soggy bottom jokes.\u201d\n\nRo hears herself say, \u201cI didn\u2019t even apply this season.\u201d\n\nMina tilts her head. \u201cWhat do you mean, this season?\u201d\n\nRo is not sure. She has the outline of a memory like a cup ring on a table: something was there, then lifted, and the circle remains. She knows the show. Everyone knows the show. She knows, in shadow and in muscle and in how her hands know to slash an X and fold butter into a sheet, that it matters to her in a way that is beyond normal. But how? She shakes her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t apply.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s like a best-of episode,\u201d Mina suggests. \u201cLike, champions return. Didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Ro says, too fast, then softer. \u201cI can call them.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall them,\u201d Mina says. She looks around as if expecting someone to roll in a camera rig that says Surprise! \u201cWhatever it is, you look like you just got struck by lightning and kissed by a stranger.\u201d\n\nRo wipes her hands until they are only mostly clean, then smears butter on her jeans by accident and laughs, and then goes into the office. The office is a closet with ambitions. The phone number in the email is a London area code. She doesn't think about the time difference until the line clicks and a woman with a voice like a radio host answers: \u201cBake Off production. Clare speaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d Ro says, and her voice sounds unfamiliar to her own ears. \u201cI\u2019m Rosa Avery. I think you, uh, sent me an email. I just wanted to confirm that this is real and not... Like. Spam, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cRosa! Wonderful,\u201d Clare says. Papers, voices in the background. \u201cYes, we\u2019re very real. We had an unexpected opening due to travel issues with one of our finalists. Your name was on a very short list. When I say very, I mean: one or two. Are you free to be in the tent next Friday?\u201d\n\nRo sits down on the desk chair that has one stubborn wheel. It slides. \u201cNext Friday. In the UK?\u201d The word tent goes through her like a chord in a song she used to know the harmony to.\n\n\u201cYes. We can get you to Heathrow. From\u2014 Indiana, correct?\u201d Clare pronounces Indiana like it\u2019s an exotic dessert. \u201cWe can handle accommodations. Of course you\u2019ll have to fill a few forms out\u2014 dietary, allergy, confidentiality. I\u2019ll send you a packet. Oh, and, um, congratulations.\u201d\n\nRo feels something in her chest that might be joy or might be panic. The world narrows. Then opens. \u201cI... yes. Yes, I can be there.\u201d\n\nMina leans into the office doorway like she has been pressed there by curiosity. When Ro covers the receiver, Mina whispers, \u201cIs it real? Is it real?\u201d Ro nods, and Mina\u2019s face splits into a grin so large it looks like it could swallow a sky.\n\nClare keeps talking about flights and what to bring and the filming schedule. Ro writes in blunt pencil that she licks to make it darker. She hears the word final again and again, the f in it like a flick of heat. When she closes the call and the office goes back to being quiet, she sits with the weight of it.\n\n\u201cShe cute?\u201d Mina asks, because there is no world where Mina does not make a joke when there is silence. \u201cThe voice?\u201d\n\nRo laughs. \u201cHer name is Clare.\u201d\n\n\u201cClare can be cute,\u201d Mina says with deep conviction. \u201cOh, Ro. You\u2019re going to be great. We have to make a list. You need to bring your measuring spoons that look like tiny whales. And your grater with the personality disorder. And that wooden spoon that\u2014 where did you get that wooden spoon again?\u201d\n\nRo thinks of the spoon with the burn mark like a crescent. She thinks of her kitchen drawer at home with the spool of twine she never replaces. She thinks, as if through fog, of a tent with white peaks and strings of bunting that ripple. Of judges with eyes like birds and the smell of fresh lemon under hot lights. The memory is not a memory. It\u2019s a leaning toward.\n\nHank bursts in with a jar of apricot jam. \u201cWe had apricot,\u201d he says, triumphant.\n\n\u201cUse it like it\u2019s 1997,\u201d Ro says. Mina and Ro lock eyes. It is real, it is absurd. The noise of the diner resumes like a lifted pause.\n\nShe makes croissants and thinks about the word final. It\u2019s a word like a door you close and hope opens again. She has been closing a lot of doors lately. Some of them will never open. Some of them already have and she just needs to turn around.\n\nBy the time the breakfast rush slows enough that her back stops screaming, she has called her mother and left a message that says, in a rush of air, \u201cI\u2019m going to the Bake Off final.\u201d She doesn\u2019t mention how her mother will hear the capital letters.\n\nMina conscripts Theo\u2014 Ro\u2019s brother\u2014 within an hour, because good news spreads faster than jam. He arrives at the diner with his hair still wet from his morning pool practice and a grin like he is nine again. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d he says into Ro\u2019s neck when he hugs her. \u201cYou\u2019re not. You\u2019re going to crush it. Can you make a cake with a pool in it? Like, an actual pool. With lanes.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay in your lane,\u201d Ro says, and then relents and adds a pool to the mental inventory of cake opportunities. \u201cLet me see. I need to get time off. I need to tell Harriet.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll get it,\u201d Theo says, as if Harriet, the owner of Grackle\u2019s, is their aunt instead of a person who hired Ro because Ro could look at a spreadsheet and a souffle with equal competence. Harriet, when told, raises an eyebrow and says, \u201cWe\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m mad at you for leaving me mid-semester but actually I will watch every second and pretend I taught you everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoever else is in the final is doomed,\u201d Hank declares, dragging a mop the way a knight might drag a spear.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t jinx me,\u201d Ro says, and here it comes, like the weather breaking. Mina has never been delicate. She is precise when it matters. She says, \u201cThere\u2019s a list.\u201d\n\n\u201cA list,\u201d Ro repeats.\n\n\u201cSomeone posted it. Someone always posts it,\u201d Mina says, half-apologetic but also not. \u201cI think you would have seen it anyway, but I went looking. Guess who\u2019s on it.\u201d\n\nRo stiffens, and she doesn\u2019t know why until she does. The shape of the name lands in her before she hears it. Some enemies are architecture. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Ro says again, and it has no weight.\n\n\u201cCeleste March,\u201d Mina says. Saying it is a small act of violence. \u201cShe\u2019s on the list.\u201d\n\nRo\u2019s fingers flex, flour ghosts. \u201cCeleste.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Mina says softly. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\nRo remembers\u2014 but does she?\u2014 a girl with a mouth like a razor and a coat that always smelled expensive. A girl who used to beat her on time by seconds and would always make that matter, a person who loved the optics of winning. They\u2019d met on the Bloomington bake circuit, which is less glamorous than it sounds and mostly involves church basements and the taste of paper cups. Celeste had been on and off in town, visiting her grandmother, and turning up wherever there were prizes and cameras. At an apple pie contest, Celeste had said, \u201cHandsome pies aren\u2019t always tasty,\u201d and looked at Ro like she had said something else. Ro had replied with, \u201cI don\u2019t make either of those,\u201d and the people around them had laughed, and it had felt like being pushed and pulled at the same time.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an arch-nemesis without the arch,\u201d Mina says with relish. \u201cJust a nemesis, really.\u201d\n\nRo goes back to work because the lens she knows best is the one that fits in her hand. She cuts squares of dough, lays ribbons of chocolate, folds, pinches. She knows what happens to people who make their enemies into architecture. Buildings fall. She breathes. Celeste had left town and gone to New York and was either a chef or a person who took photos of chefs. The last time Ro had seen her had been at the farmer\u2019s market in June before the accident. No\u2014 after? The chronology refuses to behave. Celeste had looked surprised to see Ro, like Ro had been a myth. Maybe Ro has always been a myth if you tilted your head. A stud with flour on her knees. The woman who shows up with a toolbox and a whisk.\n\nLater, in the calm that arrives like a cat and refuses to be called, Ro goes home. Her small apartment on the second floor of a house with a porch that creaks. The porch has a swing. The swing has held four sleeping people at once on nights the heat would not end. The kitchen window looks over a maple. When the light catches the leaves, it makes a thousand coins. There is a string of flags over the counter that she does not remember hanging. They look like they belong in a tent.\n\nShe stands in her kitchen and makes a list. The lists have been her survival. Lists and fixed points. She writes: passport, apron, reliable steel bowl, favorite whisk (curly handle), heat-proof gloves, notes, recipe ideas. Then she writes, in the bottom corner, like a secret: Remember to breathe in the tent.\n\nThere is a box under her bed that she tells herself has out-of-season boots. She drags it out. It is light. Not boots. She recognizes the tape\u2014 hosting tape with daisies printed on it\u2014 and the handwriting: hers. The past keeps leaving her notes like that, in her own hand, and she follows them as if the arrow is still leading her true.\n\nShe breaks the tape and lifts the lid. It is not boots. Inside is a folded apron that smells faintly of citrus and heat. It is the soft blue of cloud. The apron has a patch sewn onto it that says Bake Off in a looping font and a tiny embroidered rose someone has added. She picks it up the way you pick up a newborn: not sure where it will bend, not wanting to snap anything. Beneath the apron is a wooden spoon with a burn mark on the bowl and, under that, a rectangle of heavy cardstock. The card is glossy and has a photograph printed on it. The photograph is of a woman with a dimple in her left cheek and flour on her forehead, holding a cake that looks like a tower built by a person whose patience has been turned to sugar. The woman is Ro. The caption reads: Winner. Season (the number is framed out by her hand).\n\nIt is as if someone has reached into her chest and curled their hand around her heart to show her it exists. She drops the card. It falls face down and she cannot make it turn over.\n\nShe calls her mother again. Her mother picks up on the second ring and says, \u201cIf this is a telemarketer, you are about to learn some new vocabulary.\u201d\n\nRo says nothing for a beat. Then: \u201cMom.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d her mother says, and there is a note in her voice that says she has been expecting this call for months.\n\n\u201cThey asked me to go,\u201d Ro says. She sits on the floor beside the box and the apartment is suddenly too big. \u201cThey want me in the final. Next Friday.\u201d She says it like she is telling the weather to stop raining. \u201cI said yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Mom,\u201d Ro says, because the tightness in her chest has a name and it is a question, \u201cwhy is there a photo of me in a box under my bed that says winner on it?\u201d If she had written down the sentence and then had to describe the moment of reading it aloud, she would leave it blank so the reader could fill in the rest.\n\nHer mother is quiet, and Ro can hear the antiques shop where her mother works in the wind chimes and the timestamp of the register opening. \u201cHoney,\u201d her mother says. \u201cAfter the accident, we were... you asked us not to tell you anything until you asked yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were on TV,\u201d her mother says, and Ro hears the pride and the fear braided. \u201cLast year. You applied like the world was on fire and you were the only one who could bake the rain. You sent in a video that you filmed in our kitchen with the yellow walls. They called you. You left. It happened. There was a tent and judges and a whole universe. And then there was a trophy and a handshake that made you start crying, and you hate crying in front of people. But you cried, and you won. You came home, and then you went to get an oven in Shelbyville because you said you couldn\u2019t go back to a little oven anymore.\u201d\n\nRo\u2019s laugh is not a laugh. It breaks like a plate. \u201cThat was last year?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d her mother says. \u201cWe tried to tell you after the accident, but you didn\u2019t remember the fall\u2014 you didn\u2019t remember winter, really\u2014 and you got so upset when you saw videos that felt like someone else\u2019s life. The doctor said to let you set the pace. You started baking again. We figured... you\u2019d know when you were ready to know. I\u2019m sorry, honey. I thought you\u2019d want to open the box with me there.\u201d\n\nRo looks at the apron and the spoon and the card and the word winner that she did not let herself see. She has a memory now, but it does not feel like a memory yet; it feels like being told a story about herself that has the right shape. She touches the spoon again. The burn mark. The crescent. She can see it in a room too bright to be real and hands she can\u2019t quite claim lifting it like a sword.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I hang the apron on a hook?\u201d she asks, because her brain latches onto the wrong thing when the right thing is too sharp. \u201cI hang everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said if you saw it every day it would make the not-remembering worse,\u201d her mother says. \u201cYou said you wanted to want it on your own. You will. You do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got invited to the final,\u201d Ro says again, suddenly giddy. \u201cAgain.\u201d She wasn\u2019t there and she was. The word again is a bridge that doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a bridge. The past knocks and knocks.\n\nHer mother breathes out. \u201cBe careful with your heart in there,\u201d she says, and Ro doesn\u2019t know if she means cholesterol or metaphor. \u201cAnd tell that friend of yours\u2014 Mina?\u2014 to remind you to drink water. And don\u2019t let that girl get to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know.\u201d\n\n\u201cCeleste?\u201d\n\nHer mother sighs like she has been waiting for a storm and it has, finally, appeared. \u201cThat one. Last year you told me not to say her name because it made your eye twitch. She was mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cMean isn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d Ro says, and she feels that old, irrational, undefeatable surge of protectiveness for her own good humor. You can take the pie from the oven at the wrong time, you can drop the cake. You can take my winter. But don\u2019t you take my jokes.\n\nRo hangs up and the apartment resumes its normal dimensions. The light has moved across the floor. She picks up the card and makes herself look at it. Ro in the photograph looks like someone who has rehearsed the way to hold joy so it doesn\u2019t break. Maybe she did. Maybe she will again. She wants to throw up. She wants to run around the block. She wants to call Clare and say that she can\u2019t make it and also that she can\u2019t wait.\n\nThere is a list with Celeste\u2019s name on it. Ro opens her laptop and searches without searching. There it is: an article on a food site with too many ads. The headline is coy: Rumored Finalists Revealed? The names scroll. Ro\u2019s. A few others she recognizes in an odd sideways way, like a song you heard once in a car you didn\u2019t own. And Celeste March, of course. The photo with Celeste is black-and-white, artsy, knife-sharp. Celeste is all cheekbones and an expression that looks like she just thought of the way she\u2019ll win and is letting you see the corner of it. She has a caption with words like savant and ferment and pop-up.\n\nRo\u2019s mouth does that thing it does when she is angry: it goes careful. She does not slam the laptop shut in case it collapses like a thing with too much air in it. She stands instead. She paces the kitchen, which is not big. She almost knocks her elbow on the fridge three times. She runs water. She drinks the glass like it contains a secret.\n\nIt would be easier, she thinks, if this were all about baking. If it were just flour and eggs and the alchemy you do when you turn butter into glass and then into softness. But the tent\u2014 last time?\u2014 had not been just baking. It had been lights, yes, and a small haunted family of tents and a field and people. One of them had been Celeste. Had she? The memory tries to stand up and keeps not quite making it.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she says to the room, and the room accepts it.\n\nShe takes the apron to the sink and washes it by hand. The water turns a little warm and purls around her wrists. She hangs the apron over the chair back and stands so close to it that the blue feels like sky. She puts the spoon next to the stove. She knows she will carry it with her, a relic and a talisman and a weight.\n\nThere are more calls. Clare again, with a flight that departs in three days from Indianapolis. Harriet, with a long warning about how she hates goodbyes so Ro should just leave the keys on the hook and not make a fuss. Theo, again, because he is a persistent brother but this time with a playlist for plane anxiety that is mostly strings and the one song he knows makes her cry in a good way. Her aunt, who has a voice like steam and laughs that knock the wind out of you. Everyone says, do this. Everyone says, we love you. No one says, are you sure, because they know that Ro is never sure until she is inside the thing and then she is sure forever.\n\nAt midnight, with the window open so she can hear the small city be at ease with itself, Ro puts a notebook on the table and opens to a fresh page. She writes: Signature bake ideas, then leaves it blank because she hates filling in the first line. She writes: showstopper\u2014 something with Indiana summer, corn like sunshine, maple like that tree back there. She writes: proofing. She writes: sugar glass, spun. She doodles a tent and draws bunting that looks like tiny teeth.\n\nShe sleeps for three hours and dreams of a field that doesn\u2019t end, and a woman with a sharp smile cutting through it, and a judge with kind eyes lifting a hand toward her. She wakes with the shape of Celeste\u2019s name on her tongue like an aftertaste she can\u2019t get rid of. The morning is a punctuation mark: up. She goes to the market.\n\nAt the farmer\u2019s market, the vendors already know where she will move, because she always goes in the same order. She buys butter, obscene amounts, and pretends it is for a party. She buys eggs from a woman named Lark who writes little poems on the cartons. Ro reads one out loud: \u201cA yolk is a sun that forgot to shine outward.\u201d Lark laughs and blushes and asks Ro if she is going somewhere. Ro says, \u201cJust across an ocean, nothing serious,\u201d and the regulars in the coffee line hoot. Bloomington is a town that knows how to practice being a village. Everyone knows everyone and everyone assumes they don\u2019t know the parts that matter the most.\n\nOn the way home, she cuts through the bike repair co-op to tell Eddie she won\u2019t be at Wednesday night fix-it. Eddie looks at her calves in admiration and then says, \u201cI knew you were going to leave us for the glitz and glamour.\u201d He gives her a chain for a necklace, \u201cto ward off evil sprockets,\u201d and kisses both his fingers and taps her forehead. \u201cBring us back a scone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of scone.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurprise me.\u201d\n\nAt the door of her building, she catches her reflection in the glass and for a moment, it startles her. She looks like she has always looked: strong around the shoulders, eyes that go narrow when she is focusing, mouth with a scar at one corner that you\u2019d only notice if you kissed her. The person in the glass looks like someone who is ready for a thing she does not fully understand. She opens the door.\n\nAt home, there is a package on the stoop. It\u2019s addressed to her in a hand that tries to be anonymous and fails. Inside: a short, clean-edged metal whisk, heavier than the ones she owns. The handle is engraved. Winner. Ro. 2024. And below that, an arrow that points forward.\n\nShe should be surprised. She is not. She is something else. She is shaking, laugh-shaking, the way you do when you get the joke and also are the punchline. She loves the feel of metal in her hand. She hates seeing proof of last winter in a font. She holds the whisk up to the window light. The handle catches. The word is undeniable. It exists and does not require her belief to stand.\n\nA note tumbles out of the box. There is no signature. The message is two lines: If you forgot, that\u2019s okay. You remembered once. You\u2019ll do it again.\n\nShe puts the whisk down, gently, like it might break the table. She goes to the bathroom. She turns on the shower and does not get in. She grips the sink. She breathes. She watches herself in the mirror, water running behind her like weather. \u201cI\u2019m last year\u2019s winner,\u201d she says out loud, to see if the words sit right in her mouth. They are too big. They are good. They fall into place. In the mirror, her eyes change shape. The anger and the fear and the excitement make a braid.\n\nThe phone pings. There is another message she has been ignoring in the flood: a social media tag from the one person she wishes would stay out of her house. It\u2019s Celeste. A story, video-on, the voice with the edges. \u201cSee you in the tent, Avery,\u201d Celeste says, her mouth making the name like a dare. \u201cTry not to get lost.\u201d\n\nRo laughs. \u201cI was born lost,\u201d she tells the empty room and the shower and the whisk. \u201cWatch me find my way.\u201d She hits record and sends back a story that is only her hand cracking a single egg into a bowl, one-handed, clean and easy, the yolk unbroken. Then she puts her phone face down and goes to turn off the shower and sits on the bathroom floor with water spritzing her ankles, not crying and not not crying.\n\nIt will be okay. It will be a mess. It will be both. She has an apron that has seen something she cannot remember. She has a hand that knows what the rest of her does not, and a rival with a voice like a thin knife, and a city that smells like limestone and coffee and wet leaves. She has three days and a flight and a night to pack and a spoon that remembers fire. She has the word winner graved into metal, which is a kind of truth you can\u2019t un-etch.\n\nThe night leans its head on her shoulder. She gets up. She dries the edge of the sink with the hem of her shirt, because she cannot stand water beading, because something in her insists on finishing small things. In the kitchen, the blue apron makes a gentle shape on the chair that could be a memory if she lets it. Someone in the apartment below plays the same song for an hour in a way that suggests heartbreak or practice or both.\n\nRo sets out the bowls for morning. She writes one more note in the notebook, mid-page this time, no fear of breaking the first line: This time, remember that you love it. Then she puts her hand on the whisk like a person taking an oath. The display on the stove clock blinks an hour that is too late. Tomorrow will be too soon, and she will wake up anyway, and she will go to the place where lights and sugar meet. She will meet her nemesis in a line that isn\u2019t an arch, she will stand in a tent she has stood in before, and she will make something that does not exist yet, out of flour and butter and heat and something you can\u2019t weigh.\n\nOutside, the maple clicks. The fog gets ready. The city sleeps with one eye open. Ro sleeps with both and dreams of a long table, white cloth, a row of cakes like buildings. There\u2019s a hand that isn\u2019t hers\u2014 not yet\u2014 reaching to touch the crumb. When she wakes, her mouth tastes of lemon. She thinks, without knowing why, that she loved that judge with the kind eyes like a person loves a horizon. It was a thing to move toward, once. It will be again. Some mornings, you get the luxury of starting over. Some mornings, you start over without asking for luxury. Both kinds must be eaten warm, with jam.",

                              "content": "The morning puts its teeth on the edge of the blinds and bites, then thinks better of it and slides golden along the counter. Bloomington has a way of apologizing for night with light, and Ro stands in her kitchen with a mug that has never decided what color it wants to be and watches the blue apron make weather on the back of a chair. She slept like the kind of person who had to proof her dreams, and now the floury part of her brain is awake before the coffee has explained itself. She makes toast with too much butter, because she is loyal, and she scrapes the crumb to hear what it says back. Out the window the maple tosses coins again. Her hands move in the air of their own accord, kneading nothing. The nothing is not empty. It is full of a tent she cannot articulate and a name she will not avoid.\n\nMina texts her an alarmingly enthusiastic string of comet emojis and the words ceramics night still on? Ro replies with a thumbs-up and a loaf and then another loaf because one loaf is stingy. Before the museum, there are lists, and between the lists there is practice. Harriet reserves the back station for her, sliding over the roster with a shrug that says, without saying, go be a star and also don\u2019t tell anyone I said that. Hank hovers in the buoyant way of an overexcited planet. He carries a crate of eggs as if they are newborn kittens and asks if he should guard the door with a baking sheet like a shield. Ro tells him he can be her squire and he swells to the correct level of absurdity.\n\nShe lays out ingredients as if setting a stage. Bowls like moons, a forest of brushes, a square of marble she stole fair and square from the pastry department months ago with permission that arrived after the fact. Cornmeal in a bag she bought from a farmer whose knuckles are the color of wet rope. A bottle of maple that smells like October. A clutch of lemons, because avoidance is cowardly when it comes in the shape of fruit. She thinks of Indiana, persimmon pudding and jam thick as truth and limestone stacks that hold history together, and she knows showstoppers are besides the point until they aren\u2019t. Her pencil scrawls in the notebook, corn frangipane tart with maple glaze, candied corn silk nest, sugar glass shard river, and she circles the word nest because it makes her feel safe and smiled at.\n\nTheo arrives with a swim bag and that post-lap shimmer and kisses the top of her head like the annoying priest of a religion he invented five minutes ago. He declares himself quality control and steals a scrap of raw dough and makes a face to remind her he is an amateur. He pulls up a stool and gives a running commentary on the biomechanics of whisking that is ninety percent nonsense and ten percent something she will never admit helped. Mina bursts in like a second act, a jacket flung around her shoulders that is more patches than fabric, and a handful of tiny bottles of fancy vanilla she bought at a store that sells soap in colors that look like macarons. They make a ridiculous team in the reflected glass: Ro in her apron that will not admit its past, Mina in a shirt with a constellation on the wrong side of the sky, Theo in shorts and the arrogance of someone who can swim anyway. If a camera were here, Ro thinks, this is how they would want to frame it, the beloveds at the edges of a person who is about to leave.\n\nThey do not talk about Celeste while the sugar heats, because name-dropping is not unlike opening an oven too soon. The syrup goes through the stages like a book. Thread, soft ball, firm, hard. Her hand reaches for the spoon and finds the burn mark crescent; the world does a small tilt. She sees\u2014 does she?\u2014 a blaze of white tents like sails and the spoon making its orbit through amber light. Someone is saying, trust your nose, and she doesn\u2019t know who it is until she does, but she will not say the name aloud because if she names everything, there will be no air left. The snap is clean. The shards are savage and see-through. On the counter they look like a winter lake caught in the act of being honest. Mina claps in a way that would embarrass a less shameless person, and Theo whistles through his teeth and pretends he always knew she\u2019d get it right.\n\nWhen the lemon hits the heat with the sugar and the eggs, when she zest and the room fills with the exact brightness that made her flinch, she breathes into the sour and tells herself she has held sharper. The smell reaches through her like a wire and a memory unspools with it, not a full tape but a clip: a hand\u2014 hers\u2014 steady over a pot, a voice off to the side making a joke about curdling and nerves, a laugh with a kind weight in it. The laughter doesn\u2019t belong to her immediate people. It must belong to those tents. She scrapes the sieve with a spatula and the curd makes that obscene, cheerful slurp that means it set. The flinch eases like a door on a better hinge. Hank steals a spoonful and goes to his knees in mock prayer, because he cannot help it. The diner smells like a citrus grove opened a window.\n\nClare calls while Ro is wiping down, and the ring makes her put her palm over her heart as if the sound itself might knock it askew. There is always bustle at Clare\u2019s end, names called like ingredients, time called like a stern aunt. The flight is set for Thursday, out of Indianapolis at three in the afternoon, connection in Newark, then the long silver tube across the dark. Email follows with documents that say do not disclose in fonts that think they can throw their weight around. Clare\u2019s cheerfulness is industrial-strength, something that lifts in surprising places, and when she says, bring a signature that feels like you now, not like last year, Ro feels a sizzle of panic at the base of her skull and then a defiant spark. She nods though Clare cannot see her and says, \u201cI\u2019m not a person who repeats myself,\u201d and Mina mouths, you are, you absolutely are, and winks.\n\nThey talk last-minute logistics as if logistics are soft animals. Ro gives Harriet a stack of laminated schedules and instructions that are frankly insulting in their comprehensiveness, and Harriet squints at her over the rims of her readers and says, \u201cIf you die, I will kill you, but otherwise I\u2019m not worried,\u201d which in Harriet is very nearly a hug. Theo promises to take the morning shift Wednesday and Thursday and to stop making egg puns in front of customers who haven\u2019t consented. Hank solemnly vows to subdue any invasive wasps with a spray bottle and a mop. Bloomington\u2019s tiny network of kindness clicks like a gear.\n\nThey go to ceramics night because normalcy is the last rebellion sometimes. The art museum smells like clay and floor polish, and the tables are covered in brown paper and anticipation. An instructor with hair piled like a sculpture shows them how to coax a cylinder up from a lump as if they are calling it into being by having the right posture. Ro\u2019s hands know how to persuade texture into wanting more of itself, so the clay loves her on sight. She makes a mug that looks a little like the idea of a loaf and a little like a small animal trying to stand on its own. Mina makes something that claims to be a comet but will be happier as a bowl. The room hums with the particular concentration people get when they make a thing simply because a thing needs making, and the hum threads itself into Ro\u2019s sternum. Sometimes you save yourself by producing an object that will hold other things. She knows that, knows it in flour and now in clay.\n\nMina gets clay on her nose and pretends it is war paint. She tells Ro that she went down a rabbit hole and watched clips of last season with the sound off because she promised not to shove it at Ro until Ro asked. She says her favorite shot is of a pair of hands, Ro\u2019s, pulling sugar like light, and that she cried because it looked like the future and she is a sap. Ro listens carefully to the part where she cried and less carefully to everything else. She wants the future to be a thing she recognizes at least in the dark. She thinks she will bake a cake that tastes like the way Mina holds a coffee cup on the first cold day of the year. She wonders if that is possible, then feels personally responsible for making it so.\n\nOn the way back to the apartment they detour for donuts that have more metaphors than toppings. They sit on the curb because chairs are a conspiracy. A siren goes by as if to remind them that somewhere a small catastrophe is being managed, and they pass a maple-glazed ring between them with the solemnity of a sacrament. Mina pokes at the rumor list again with the caution of someone approaching a sleeping lion. She says Celeste\u2019s last pop-up in New York had a menu that made a critic say the word audacious three times as if it were an incantation. She says Celeste\u2019s hair is a sharp bob now and her eyes do that thing like she smelled blood. Ro says that Celeste has always staged her life like a photo and that a bob is a knife turned into hair. Mina says, \u201cPromise me something,\u201d and Ro says, \u201cIf you say don\u2019t let her live in your head rent-free I will raise your rent,\u201d and Mina says, \u201cPromise me you will not narrate her in your head. You save your brain for dough and light and maybe, if you are going to narrate, narrate the judge with the kind eyes looking at you like you are a horizon.\u201d Ro\u2019s breath goes sideways and then straightens. She says she promises. She means it for the length of the donut and another five minutes after, which is longer than you think when you are talking about an old, small war.\n\nHer mother calls the next morning with inventory updates that are a secret language. The antique shop has acquired a case of ceramic geese that stare the way only birds can. A man brought in a rooster weather vane that will not hold still. Someone found a box of recipe cards in a house being emptied for the second time and wanted Ro to see the one in a neat, upright hand for jam, written with the patient exactitude of a person who believed carefully measured life will not break as often. Her mother tells her the recipe over the phone, as if reciting a psalm. Ro writes it down and feels the shape of her grandmother\u2019s mouth in the words, the way certain syllables went hill-shaped and then back again. There is a new steadiness in her mother\u2019s voice now that the truth is opened like a window. It is relief and grief and pride in a tangle, and they both are smart enough not to comb it.\n\nAt the shop, later, when Ro ducks in with a bag of croissants because butter is the coin she pays for grace, her mother pulls a small tin from under the counter. Inside are three index cards and a photograph. The photograph is of a woman at a stove in a dress with a belt like a stern sentence. The woman is Ro\u2019s grandmother at twenty-five, elbow-deep in something that froths. The cards have recipes in her hand, and one is titled emergency cake and is mostly eggs and sugar and attitude. Her mother says, \u201cYou took after her hands,\u201d and Ro\u2019s hands suddenly belong to a longer story than she has been letting them belong to. She slips the cards into her notebook and leaves a croissant crumb map on the counter that her mother pretends to be offended by and then eats with her finger.\n\nPractice fills the cracks of the day until the day looks made of it. She laminates until the muscle memory quiets to something less urgent, and she stencils a pattern of corn stalks on a tart that makes Hank peer over her shoulder and whisper, \u201cYou wizard,\u201d as if he is afraid to break the sugar spell. She makes meringue that sits proud, not weeping, and she fights with a caramel cage that keeps deciding it wants to be modern art. Theo learns to torch without setting his shoelace on fire and gets obnoxiously proud of his torching face. They talk about the technical because it lives like a shadow. It will be something cruel disguised as fair, and Ro does not fear fair cruelty. She fears only the particular narrowness of her own absence. So she bakes basic loaves to remind herself that a good crumb is democracy, and she whips cream by hand to feel where it tips into butter, and she layers sponges like the floors of a house she is moving into again.\n\nCeleste posts three more stories for the public square, each one cut like a cheekbone and framed like she is not framing it at all. In one she is in a kitchen that is all angles and plants and steel, and her laugh is teethy. \u201cCounting days,\u201d she says to the camera with that soft, dangerous cadence. \u201cHope you\u2019re doing more than counting, Avery.\u201d The tag is a hook half-buried. Ro watches the first two and deletes the third as it arrives because she is not a dock and will not let herself be moored by someone else\u2019s rope. She posts a video with her phone propped on a sugar canister, not of her face but of a dough rising quiet and unstoppable under a glass bowl. She writes nothing. She lets watches. The glass fogs like a world being invented slowly. The likes come in like wildflowers on a roadside. She goes outside and kicks a stone just hard enough to remind her ankle of the universe.\n\nThe night before she leaves, she cannot make herself stop inventorying. She packs and unpacks the whisk with the engraved word six times before she talks sternly to herself about symbolism and carry-ons. She rolls socks into her mixing bowls because space is a puzzle she likes. She wraps the spoon with the crescent burn in the corner of a soft shirt and tucks it where a person might tuck a photograph. She opens the blue apron and runs her palm over the embroidered rose and wonders who added it for her and whether she cried when they did. She considers the possibility that it was her mother laboring at midnight with a needle and swears she can see one. She ties and unties the neck strap twice. She tapes a note to her own door that says keys? passport? forgiveness? with a square next to each, and she checks the first two and leaves the third blank because that is work you cannot perform and then throw in a bag.\n\nAt the diner\u2019s close, she stands with Harriet in the doorway while Hank counts the spoons as if the spoons might have multiplied in the drawer like rabbits when the light was off. The Saturday night regulars have gone home to their cats, to their shows, to their beds, and the place smells like bacon ghosts and mop water and the last pot of coffee giving up the ghost. Harriet says, \u201cIn case you need anything, I put money in the petty cash that is not petty and I labeled it travel. Take it,\u201d and Ro says, \u201cI am not twelve,\u201d and Harriet says, \u201cThen stop asking permission and act like someone who can say yes to a long flight.\u201d They have a hug that is not feminine and not masculine and very much a hug. They are, for a second, two people who have both chosen to belong to a place and to a person, which is risk, and are smiling about it anyway.\n\nBloomington, on the morning of the flight, is practicing being a postcard. The air is a little wet because it always is, and the courthouse square puts its shoulders back, and the guy on the corner with the banjo is picking something that might be a hymn if you tilt your head. Ro locks the door to her apartment and checks the handle twice for luck and because she is obsessive. The maple makes a sound like gossip. She leaves the trash out even though Thursday is not trash day because she thinks she is funny and because Mina will walk by and roll her eyes and deal with it, which is how they say I love you in their dialect. She carries the bag in one hand because she likes the weight and the promise of it, and she has the apron folded in the other like a flag that does not belong to a country but to a thing you do with your body and your hunger.\n\nAt the bus stop to the shuttle, she feels the hiccup of panic that is her body\u2019s way of telling her there is still a bear somewhere, even if it is only made of cameras and nerves. She breathes until she can remind herself to put the panic down like a too-hot pan. A man with a going-to-work face and a lunch pail nods at her bag and says, \u201cBusiness or pleasure?\u201d Ro says, \u201cBaking,\u201d and he says, \u201cThat\u2019s both,\u201d and grins that unshowy Midwestern grin that is better than luck. She thinks about the tent as a place with its own weather. She thinks about the judges as topography. She thinks about Celeste as a wind that changes direction to show off. She thinks about the word final and how it seemed like an end and now is a door. She tells herself that doors are what you make when walls are too proud.\n\nThe shuttle is late in the way that keeps you honest. Mina arrives with a thermos of coffee that tastes like Mina made it with her heart, and a paper bag of rolls she insists are lucky. Theo jogs the last block and presses a foil-wrapped something into Ro\u2019s hand and says, \u201cDon\u2019t open it until you are over the ocean,\u201d and then immediately tells her it is a peanut butter sandwich cut into triangles, because he is terrible at surprises. They crowd her like a pack, laughing too loud, because goodbyes require either whisper or riot and they are not whisperers. Harriet pulls up in her old truck and hands Ro a tin that turns out to be full of honey candy wrapped in wax paper and a screwdriver because you never know. Hank barrels around the corner drenched in dishwater and kisses her on the forehead like a benediction. Eddie from the bike co-op appears out of nowhere and loops a chain around her wrist like a bracelet and says it is for protection against mechanical failure, which is his religion.\n\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to come and be your manager or your bodyguard or your translator?\u201d Mina says, looping an arm over Ro\u2019s shoulders and digging in her heel so she swings them both a little, forcing the moment to balance. \u201cI speak British. I can say biscuit with authority.\u201d Ro leans into her and says she needs Mina here to watch the maple and to pretend not to read spoilers and to pick her up when she comes home with either very good news or very good cake.\n\nThe shuttle pulls up and Ro\u2019s stomach does a small, graceful flip like a diver who has stopped thinking about the water and is just letting gravity be. She hands her bag to a man who has seen everything that can be packed and is not impressed. She keeps the apron in her arms for a minute longer than is reasonable and then folds it into her carry-on, tucking the spoon and the whisk beside it so the three of them are in a row like people at a theater. She climbs aboard and sits by the window because she is sentimental and wants to watch her town shrink, because smallness is how you make room for other things. Her friends make faces at her through the glass until everyone, including a stranger in a suit, is laughing. The bus pulls away. Bloomington becomes a series of choices she made last week. The maple lofts another coin at the sky.\n\nOn the interstate, the billboards announce fireworks, sofas, lawyers, Jesus, and a pumpkin patch you can get lost in without trying. Cornfields run like repeating thoughts. The sky is a lid that someone forgot to screw on tight. Ro rests her head against the window and closes her eyes and feels, for the first time since the email, a thin thread of gratitude that is not covered in worry. It moves in her like yeast. It will lift the heavy parts if she lets it. She thinks of her grandmother\u2019s emergency cake and the way attitude was listed right in the ingredients, and she smiles because she is the descendant of a woman who wrote down attitude and expected you to measure it with your whole body.\n\nAt the airport, everything becomes fluorescent and rule-bound and slightly impossible. She moves through security like a person who has made peace with people telling her to take off her shoes. She is grateful for the apron in her bag the way you are grateful for a charm. She buys a magazine and does not read it. She texts her mother a photo of the gate sign and a heart that she pretends is a strawberry. She writes in the notebook in lurchy capital letters, remember to love it, and underlines it twice because she is greedy.\n\nWhen the plane takes off, the earth falls away, and Bloomington becomes a map you could fold. Ro feels her stomach drop and then level, and she thinks of the technical, of the way someone will put a recipe in front of her that has holes where the instructions should be and expect her to fill in the rest. She is not delicate. She is precise when it matters. She puts her hand flat on her knee and feels the steadiness under the metal. If you forgot, that\u2019s okay, the anonymous note had said. You remembered once. You\u2019ll do it again. She lets the words sit in her like a lemma. She believes in repetition if the point is to arrive changed.\n\nAbove the clouds it is a color you cannot name without being pretentious. The flight attendant with a dry voice offers pretzels and the possibility of wine, and Ro takes both because she is not dumb. She unwraps Theo\u2019s sandwich halfway to the ocean and eats it with the kind of reverence you reserve for reliquaries and good peanut butter. She thinks about Celeste, and the thought does not hurt for a whole minute. She thinks about the judge with the kind eyes, and the thought does that ache that is like a stretch, not like a strain. She lets herself imagine the tent again, not as a myth but as a place where she can stand and breathe and put sugar over flame and stand herself in the heat and decide that she likes it.\n\nNight over the Atlantic is a weight and a secret. Ro\u2019s eyes close. In the dream the tent rises out of a field like a city of light, and the bunting lifts in waves, and the table at the end of the aisle is laid for a banquet of what-if. Celeste is there, and the faces she can\u2019t quite bring into focus turn toward her, and somewhere in the dream a hand reaches and does not touch her but is close enough to count. She wakes with the taste of lemon again, and she smiles into the airline blanket and thinks, fine then, let it be lemon. Let everything be bright and a little dangerous and worth the burn. She looks out the window, at a dark that exists exquisitely without her opinion, and she thinks, if the horizon is a thing you move toward, she has been moving all along.",

                              "content": "The plane\u2019s wheels kiss the runway like they are surprised to find earth again, and the cabin erupts in that polite chorus of UK coughs and relieved exhalations that sound like the country is clearing its throat to speak to you civilly. Ro\u2019s spine registers all the angles she has held for seven hours, and when she stands, the world does a small slide and then decides to behave. Heathrow is a machine that has learned to pretend it\u2019s a maze, but she follows the signs for Arrivals as if someone had left her a trail of breadcrumbs that smell faintly of disinfectant and cinnamon. Her bag appears on the belt as though it had never left her, and the apron in it makes weight without making sound. When she steps into the wide mouth of the terminal, a woman with a clipboard and a scarf that looks like it is constantly, elegantly in motion says her name the way people do when they have been practicing the syllables of you for days.\n\n\u201cRosa!\u201d Clare says, and the exclamation point is baked in. \u201cYou look exactly like your emails, which is to say, efficient. Did you sleep at all? Doesn\u2019t matter. Come on. The car is this way. There\u2019s coffee, but it\u2019s airport coffee, so it knows what it is.\u201d\n\nOutside, the air feels narrower and softer, the light a courtesy more than a declaration. The car smells faintly of wool and ambition. Clare has a way of talking that stacks information into neat piles and then ties them with twine. The field is two hours, give or take the British love affair with traffic, she says. The inn is small and has opinions about toast. There\u2019s a walkthrough today\u2014just the lay of the land, cameras, introductions, any oh-my-gods that need taking care of. She says the other two have already landed and then doesn\u2019t have to say the names because Ro feels one of them like you feel a storm in your jaw.\n\nThey slip out of London like a needle threaded through hem. The highway becomes hedges and the hedges become fields and the fields become the argument for green. Ro\u2019s eyes find the old houses with faces like stern grandparents, the pubs with their chalkboards promising three adjectives for the price of one pie, the signs that say Give Way instead of Yield, which feels nicer even when it is not. Jet lag slides its hand into hers and squeezes a little too tight and then eases when Clare starts telling stories about things that have gone wrong in ways that make you proud of the going wrong. Last year the chocolate seized at the exact moment three cameras were being recalibrated, and a squirrel got inside the tent and had a moral crisis about being omnivorous. One season a baker forgot salt for an entire day and cried only once. There was an entire saga about Italian meringue and a mixer with a conscience.\n\n\u201cDo you remember the route?\u201d Clare asks at one point, throwing Ro a side glance that is careful in the way you are careful around a bruise.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember what tea I like here,\u201d Ro says, and the joke lands gently enough that the air around them relaxes. \u201cBut I remember hedges. These are very committed hedges.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the national personality,\u201d Clare says, pleased. \u201cContainment with charm.\u201d\n\nWhen the car turns down a lane that insists it is a road despite its protestations, the field opens like a palm. There are other tents like small cousins scattered about, but the big one is unmistakable: white, peaked, absurd, serene. The bunting is sleeping because the breeze hasn\u2019t found it yet. Ro has an irrational urge to take her shoes off and put her feet in the grass like a child meeting a lake. Instead, she stands in the parking area with her bag strap creasing her palm and watches the tent until her eyes do the thing where they water without permission.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Clare asks, soft-voiced, as if the tent might be listening for gossip.\n\nRo nods and then nods again, and then takes a breath into her back where breaths are supposed to be sturdier. \u201cI wrote on a piece of paper before I left,\u201d she says, because sometimes saying anything makes it easier to say the next thing. \u201cRemember to breathe in the tent. It was a joke and not a joke. I will be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be fine,\u201d Clare says, and then her production instincts make her add, \u201cYou just have to be here.\u201d\n\nInside, it\u2019s colder than it looks, the way big spaces are. The air is full of electricity and lemon and the faintest memory\u2014hers, not the tent\u2019s\u2014of a hundred episodes of desire. Stations line up like a military of possibility. Ovens with faces, mixers like loyal dogs. Someone is arranging a pyramid of eggs that will later pretend to be casual. Ro\u2019s station is a square of wood and steel and something that feels like a stage. Her name is on a little sign in a font that tries to be smiling without teeth. She puts her palm on the counter and, without meaning to, presses down until the grain answers.\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Clare murmurs. \u201cTouch everything. Meet the creatures.\u201d\n\nThe oven hums under her fingers in its resting state, dreaming of heat. The stand mixer does that proud little strut of a machine that knows it could outrun you if it had legs. The fridge is stainless and stoic. The drawers give way to reveal the choreography of tools, and when she finds the pastry scraper that is the exact width of her palm even here, she feels tears that will not arrive line up just in case. She slides the crescent-burned spoon from her bag and lays it on the counter as if she\u2019s planting a flag in a soft country. No one notices and everyone notices, but in that special way of this place where meaning is quiet until it needs not to be.\n\nThe other two finalists stand at their stations pretending they are not measuring each other with their peripheral vision. One is a man with the gentle shoulders of someone who carries trays for a living and the hands of a person who knows about heat. He has a salt-and-pepper beard and a smile that looks like it could talk you out of panicking with a story about his aunt\u2019s pudding. He introduces himself as Arjun, a pastry chef from Cardiff who makes tarts the way some people make treaties. The other is Celeste, of course, a geometry of angles and intention, in a shirt that photographs well and hair that could be a weapon. Celeste\u2019s smile when she clocks Ro is not kind or unkind; it is precise, like slicing a lemon exactly in half.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Celeste says, as if they are at a reunion for people who committed crimes together and got away with it. \u201cThey do love a narrative.\u201d\n\nArjun winces because he is polite and because he does not yet know the history. \u201cI am just glad I packed the right plug adapter,\u201d he says, which is a peace offering.\n\nRo moves toward her rival like gravity is a dare. \u201cI am the narrative,\u201d she says, and Celeste\u2019s laugh is the edge of a knife hitting wood at a satisfying angle.\n\n\u201cSo you remembered to bring jokes,\u201d Celeste says, glancing down at the spoon with the burn mark like it is a religious symbol and she is deciding whether to convert. \u201cI wondered which version of you would turn up. The wild card, the golden child, the one who forgets things, the one who wins. I would have studied.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou studied anyway,\u201d Ro says, mild, because this was always a war of tone, and you do not bring a cannon to a conversation.\n\n\u201cEvery day,\u201d Celeste murmurs, and there is something like truth in it, which is the most dangerous part of her.\n\nIntroductions unspool with the efficiency of a well-rehearsed play. Producers whose names are sticky in the best way, sound techs with belts like Swiss Army knives, camera operators with the soft eyes of people who watch carefully for a living. The hosts arrive like exclamation points drawn with eyeliner, interested and absurd and fully themselves. They shake hands with exaggerated solemnity and immediately start testing the angles of the tent for jokes, which the tent likes, because it is not humorless, just large. Ro is framed by a shoulder and a laugh and then delivered back into light.\n\nWhen the judges enter, the temperature shifts in a way that has nothing to do with air. They are not gods, but they are weather. One is a man whose face has been carved out of the idea of a handshake, blue-eyed and economical with his warmth, which is why when it arrives, people weep. The other is a woman with jewelry extravagant enough to be its own character and eyes that hold generosity like a profession. Ro\u2019s bones perform an old choreography when those eyes sweep the room; she feels relief that does not have an origin point. The kind-eyed judge meets her gaze and something in Ro\u2019s chest sounds like a baking sheet settling. It isn\u2019t recognition in the way you think of recognition, but it is that feeling of seeing a horizon and suddenly knowing which way is east.\n\n\u201cWelcome back,\u201d the woman says, a small edge of mischief in the welcome as if she\u2019s been waiting to say it, and maybe she has. \u201cTo both the field and the field\u2019s ghosts. We are very happy to have you here.\u201d\n\nRo wants to say thank you, and does, but the other thing she wants to say is ridiculous\u2014something like I think I missed you, which is unfair to place on someone you do not actually know. The man gives her a nod that contains, somehow, the handshake she hasn\u2019t yet earned this season and the one she already did last, which is more complicated than bread.\n\nThey run through safety and schedule and the ritual of pretending the tent is not always full of people before they say action. There are rules about ovens and rules about knives and rules about where to stand so you don\u2019t become an accident with a monologue. Ro listens and takes notes she won\u2019t read because writing them makes a pocket in her mind. When they get to the part where the judges will announce the Signature in the morning\u2014keep your flavors clean, your lines clear, your nerves in the appropriate drawer\u2014she feels the good fear, the one that comes with a slender smile attached.\n\nThey break for tea in a secondary tent that is a canteen and a confessional. The tea is the sort that convinces you you\u2019ve done something right in a past life. Someone has put a plate of shortbread out that tastes like butter had a dream about being polite. Arjun tells a story about the time he dropped a croquembouche and saved it with a vow and a glue of caramel that still haunts him in summer. Celeste scrolls through her phone and then not-so-subtly angles the screen away from Ro, who does not care until she does. The kind-eyed judge sits at a corner table with a stack of papers and a pen that looks like it could correct you without making you hate yourself. Ro finds herself drifting that way without a plan, as if the chair next to that gravity has been empty all day waiting for whatever Ro is now.\n\n\u201cI brought you something,\u201d the judge says without preamble, and produces from her bag a small tin the size of a person\u2019s forgiveness. \u201cDon\u2019t be cross. I know you know we can\u2019t technically give you gifts, but I put these together when I heard you were coming back because I wanted you to have a thing that tasted like steady. Lemon biscuits. My grandmother\u2019s. I promise the irony isn\u2019t lost on me.\u201d\n\nRo blinks, then laughs because laughing is what she does when the universe hands her a scene and expects her to behave. \u201cIf I swoon that will be very embarrassing for both of us,\u201d she says, and the judge\u2019s mouth makes a shape like it has known worse.\n\n\u201cYou can swoon lying down,\u201d she says, dry to the point of desert. \u201cEat one now or later as you like. We are not doing a lemon challenge. That is not a spoiler. That is a kindness.\u201d\n\nRo takes one. The biscuit snaps exactly right and fills the room with that clean, holy sour. It lands on her tongue and is not a flashback; it is an invitation. The flinch that lemon has been leaving like a calling card doesn\u2019t show up to the party. She feels the relief of a person who tried a door twice and finally found it unlocked. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says, which is insufficient, and the judge\u2019s hand does that tapping thing people do near their teacup when they are pleased.\n\n\u201cMake what you are now,\u201d the judge says, as if it\u2019s easy and the hardest thing. \u201cNot what you think we remember. The tent is not sentimental. But I am,\u201d she adds, her eyes going bright with something that looks suspiciously like fondness. \u201cAnd I am allowed to be.\u201d\n\nArjun informs them very seriously that he has brought a lucky tea towel that his daughter embroidered with a whale that looks like a potato and that his wife says he is not allowed to wash under any circumstances. Celeste overhears, executes an eye roll that would win awards if that sort of thing had a category, and then admits that she keeps a coil of string in her pocket that her grandmother used to tie pastry boxes with and that touching it before a bake has always been like checking her pulse. \u201cDon\u2019t overinterpret it,\u201d she warns, which is the same as instructing the clouds not to be sky.\n\nThe inn that night is the kind of old that makes every floorboard look like it has a long story to tell you if only you\u2019d buy it a beer. Ro\u2019s room is up two narrow flights of stairs and under a slope of roof that will bang its head if you try to sit up too fast. The wallpaper is floral in the way of polite hauntings, and there is a window with a view of a tree that is not her maple but is nosy and comforting anyway. She opens her bag and lays the blue apron on the bed like a map. Touching it in this new country changes the taste of the memory in her mouth\u2014less shock, more curiosity. She leaves it there while she splashes water on her face from a sink that makes the idea of turning taps into a ritual.\n\nMina calls without fanfare, because time zones are a suggestion. The video freezes twice, and Mina still manages to get clay on her cheek though she has not touched clay since yesterday. She asks what the rooms smell like. Ro says beeswax and lemon biscuit, and Mina declares she will marry the building. They talk for eleven minutes about the tree outside the window because talking about small things is how you make the big thing fit in your chest. Theo appears in the background at Mina\u2019s apartment, wearing a towel like a toga because he does not know what clothes are. He crosses himself like a swimming Catholic and says, \u201cTorch responsibly,\u201d and exits frame to a chorus of groans.\n\nRo writes in the notebook until the pages feel heavier. Signature ideas that feel like Indiana translated into patisserie, not a pastiche, not a state fair, but the part of home that can stand up to cameras without flinching. She sketches a tartlet that uses corn in three textures\u2014cornmeal shell, corn custard, corn silk sugared and crisp\u2014married to maple like two old women who finally got to live together legally. A second set that nods toward the limestone quarries, sugar glass and white chocolate, a geology of sweetness that will break just right. The temptation to be clever is loud; she makes it sit in the corner with a biscuit. The showstopper sketch is ridiculous in scale and stubborn in its simplicity: a layered cake rising in terraces like a courthouse square, each level a season she lived through whether or not she remembers, painted with syrups that taste like rain and an early frost. She writes, do not sugar-sculpt the maple leaf unless you will do it well, and underlines well twice.\n\nIn the half-sleep before dawn, a dream arrives with its hands up to show it\u2019s unarmed. The tent again, but close now, the clink of spoons and the soft rasp of someone whispering their list under their breath like a prayer. She stands at her station and there is a hand on the other side of her, the judge\u2019s hand this time, not touching, just a gravity, and she hears, as if the dream has a sound designer, her own voice say, I think I love this, and then wakes with her heart obligingly going in a steady line rather than a canyon.\n\nCall time is an hour that should be illegal. The makeup people are kind in that brisk way that keeps nerves from becoming your entire personality. They add a fiction of sleep to under-eyes and throw her hair into a category called intentional. The wardrobe person hands her the production apron and doesn\u2019t blink when she asks if she might wear the blue one underneath, beneath the canvas like a secret. \u201cIf anyone asks,\u201d the wardrobe person says, pinning a rogue strap, \u201cit\u2019s a layer. Layers are flattering.\u201d\n\nThe tent hums as bodies file in, everyone circling their spots the way birds circle branches before committing. The hosts do a rehearsal of the opening lines with a degree of goof that would embarrass mortals, then go softer and let the cameras see the part of them that loves this as a craft. The judges stand like weather systems pretending to be people, hands folded, faces open enough to let you hope and stern enough to let you know hope is a dessert, not a main.\n\nClare squeezes Ro\u2019s shoulder as she clips the microphone pack to the waistband of her jeans, the production equivalent of a benediction. \u201cYou ready?\u201d she asks, and the tone is medical: do you need anything before we start cutting?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ro says, and then tells the truth, which is, \u201cYes,\u201d and what she needs is Guatemalan coffee and five more hours, but what she gets is the deep breath she practiced and the spoon under her hand like a history book she likes again. Arjun makes eyes at her as if to say, we survived airports; we can survive this. Celeste taps her pocket where the string lives and holds Ro\u2019s gaze for a second longer than is hospitable. \u201cTry not to fall in love with the tent twice,\u201d Celeste murmurs, not unkind, and Ro could hate her for that and chooses not to. She puts her hand on her station and says, \u201cMy heart is a polyamorous disaster; it will be fine,\u201d and Arjun chokes on his own laugh so loudly a sound tech checks his levels.\n\nThe countdown happens like it always does in this place where ritual is measured out in butter and nerves. The hosts stand at the front, grins calibrated, voices pitched to cut through sugar dust. The gentleman judge clears his throat, the lady judge adjusts her bangles, the crew holds their breath without being told to. The words roll out in the exact cadence that lives in the collective human unconscious now, the instruction that is both invitation and dare. Somewhere, an egg unembarrasses itself by being perfect. Somewhere, a whisk dreams of becoming air. Somewhere, a woman from Bloomington who won last time without remembering it now stands at a table looking at a bowl and a pile of lemons and a sack of cornmeal and thinks, I am different and I am the same and here is my proof.\n\nThe Signature is announced, and the tent leans forward as if it has ears. Twelve small tarts, the judges say, identical, two flavors represented, one fruit-led, one indulgent, crisp cases, delicate finish, three hours. It is, in other words, a way to see if your hands know how to speak in both accents without translating. Ro hears the words like a metronome. Her mind does a quick inventory of what she has in her arsenal that is not a brag. Corn and maple, she thinks, because Indiana should have a seat, and lemon and thyme, she decides, because she owes citrus a good moment and because the smell of thyme in butter makes her less afraid of herself.\n\nTime is a trapeze. Ro measures butter with the speed of people who have made mistakes and would prefer not to repeat them. The pastry comes together under her hands with the promiscuous affection of flour for fat. She refrigerates with the exactitude of a surgeon closing a chest. She zests lemon and lets the oils spray her hands until her skin starts to smell like courage. Across from her, Arjun is making something custard-forward that is going to make someone\u2019s grandmother appear in the corner and nod. Celeste, infuriatingly, looks as if this is a warm-up, which might be true and might be staging, and Ro refuses to invest in that stock.\n\nHosts flit by like helpful bees. One of them leans a hip against her station and asks her with that conspirator\u2019s tone how you get corn silk to behave. \u201cYou bribe it,\u201d Ro says, sugaring the strands with patience. \u201cPromise it a better life, tell it it\u2019s pretty, and then put it on top of something that can hold it up.\u201d The host cackles and moves on to Arjun, who is muttering respectful things to his tart shells like a man giving a pep talk to a wall that insists on being a door.\n\nThe male judge looms at her elbow as if looming were a kindness, and perhaps in him it is. He lifts a corner of the pastry case without touching anything, which is a magic trick he has had years to practice. \u201cCorn,\u201d he says, flat, as if the word owes him money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my home,\u201d Ro says, and then, because she cannot help herself, \u201cand maple pays the rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cClever is cheap,\u201d he says, with the faintest wink that could also be a twitch. \u201cBut if your bake is good, I will forgive you for the pun.\u201d\n\nThe kind-eyed judge follows in his wake and smiles at the lemon zest under Ro\u2019s nails like it is a letter she plans to answer. \u201cWe like a baker who courts difficulty,\u201d she says mildly. \u201cWe like her better if she wins.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like me if I win, too,\u201d Ro says, and the judge\u2019s laugh is that same weighty, kind noise from before, the sound of a lid lifted up for a second to let steam out, so everything doesn\u2019t blow.\n\nRolling, lining, blind-baking. Sugar boiled to exactly the temperature that will not punish you for stopping too soon. There is a moment where the corn custard wants to become scrambled eggs, and Ro murmurs at it with the sternness of an aunt at a christening, and it yields to her good intentions. The lemon curd goes silky like it has been practicing this muscle memory on its own time. She pipes without flourish because this is a time for rightness, not drama, and the sugared corn silk nest perches on top like it was born there, like the word nest is literal. The thyme, picked leaf by leaf, freckle-kisses the lemon tops. The maple glaze goes on with a thin, exact sheen that makes the tarts look as if they know their own faces under their makeup.\n\nCeleste, of course, pulls hers out as if timing were a lover who always arrives on time for her and leaves when she says. She does something with fermented fruit that smells mysterious and dangerous and like she will argue with you later and win. Arjun arranges his piped cream in a geometry that would make a math teacher sigh happily. Around them, the tent makes the sounds of spatulas against bowls, the small oaths of people who have miscounted by one and the ecstatic inhale of someone whose caramel did not crystallize this time. Outside, a bird absolutely uninterested in television lands on a pole and considers whether a tent makes a good windbreak.\n\nThe minute hand becomes the kind of enemy you can negotiate with or be broken by. Ro places her tarts on the slate like she is laying down a hand of cards she believes in and, with a spare thirty-four seconds that feel like a joke, wipes her bench in straight lines because that is the ritual she developed last year and only barely remembers. Celeste catches the movement out of the corner of her eye and almost imperceptibly mirrors it, which tells Ro two things at once. It tells her that some habits communicate across the amnesia, and it tells her that Celeste watches her more closely than she will ever admit.\n\n\u201cHands up,\u201d the call comes, and the tent is a held breath. Ro\u2019s hands go up, and the blue apron under the canvas one warms with her, and the spoon on her station looks stupidly small in the context of cameras and chatter and nerves. She drops them to her sides and looks at her work and thinks, if the past is a country I have visited, this is a souvenir I can actually use. She looks at Celeste and thinks, try me. She looks at the kind-eyed judge and thinks, horizon. Then she looks at the floor because she needs the ground to be a thing she can count on in this country where counting is sometimes poetry and sometimes math. The judges move forward, the hosts lean in, the crew inhales, and somewhere far away in Bloomington, a maple leaf trembles without cause and without apology.",

                              "content": "The first bite the judges take is always for the cameras and also never for the cameras. They lean in as one might lean into a good storm, and Arjun goes first because the order rotates with an ancient fairness that does not mind being stage-managed. The blue-eyed judge taps the crust with a fingernail and nods once, fractional, the way bank vaults nod. The kind-eyed judge tilts her head to let the scent in properly, then lifts a tart and looks at its bottom as if the tart has a secret it will only tell her. They talk low and generous about custard set and the way nutmeg should be a rumor, not a headline. Arjun\u2019s smile creases into relief like a map that has given up pretending it wasn\u2019t folded. He looks up at Ro for a second like you look up at a person who happened to be in the room when your child took a first step, and she gives him a grin that is mostly teeth and palm-sweat. He will be dangerous in the kind way, the way that disarms you into rooting for his victory even when you are busy trying to win.\n\nCeleste is a study in loaded calm. She has plated as if symmetry were a challenge she set and met hours ago. Her fermented fruit gleams like she whispered wicked things to it and it giggled. The blue-eyed judge\u2019s mouth does a thing it does when he admires technique but dislikes being made to say it out loud; the corners lift with reluctance built in. \u201cYou took a risk with fermentation,\u201d he says, and Celeste\u2019s eyes flash with the satisfaction of a woman who sells high and buys lower. \u201cIt paid off,\u201d he adds, and she pretends she had not already written that praise for herself in her head.\n\n\u201cYour pastry\u2019s a touch thick on two of them,\u201d the kind-eyed judge murmurs, running a finger along an edge and showing a flake to the air as if she is consulting the tent. \u201cBut the flavor is controlled and surprising. It tastes like you\u2019re making a promise you intend to keep.\u201d Celeste does not blush, but there is a shift in her shoulder that says she heard an older woman approve of her and that will echo for longer than she\u2019ll volunteer.\n\nRo\u2019s slate is a small landscape of Indiana smuggled under canvas. For a second she has an idiot\u2019s urge to put her hands over them and say, \u201cBe kind,\u201d like a mother bird making herself look large. She moves her hands to the sides and does not explain herself. The blue-eyed judge lifts a lemon and thyme tart and cuts cleanly; the cross-section is a poem about steadiness. He smells, he bites, he holds his face in that austere way he has that makes bakers forget language. \u201cThe zest is generous,\u201d he says, finally, a short sermon. \u201cBorderline dangerous. But the curd is set perfectly, and the thyme is not shouting which is rare for herbs in a dessert.\u201d\n\nThe kind-eyed judge\u2019s mouth curves in that way that would make Ro donate a kidney. \u201cIt\u2019s bright without being a slap,\u201d she says. \u201cI like the restraint in the finish. Your piping is not trying to impress anyone it doesn\u2019t have to impress.\u201d\n\nHe moves to the corn and maple and the presence of an American ingredient in this hallowed field makes him hold a breath he thinks people can\u2019t hear. He cracks the tart like a safe\u2014no, like a person who loves a crisp shell the way some people love first lines of novels. The custard is satin that knows the word grain but chooses not to say it. He bites and waits. Ro can feel the tent lean; the corn silk crunches when his knife nudges it. \u201cUnexpected,\u201d he says, which is a word that can mean you have disappointed him or delighted him. He swallows like a judge swallowing does when sweetness and salt did not betray him. \u201cThis is excellent,\u201d he finishes, offensively restrained. \u201cMaple is the right size here. And you\u2019ve respected the corn without turning this into a thesis about your hometown.\u201d\n\nThe kind-eyed judge is less stingy with weather. \u201cI had my doubts about the silk,\u201d she says frankly, teeth showing in the way wolves show their teeth to indicate they are friendly. \u201cI\u2019ve had some very silly garnish in this tent, Rosa. But this is crisp and gentle. It\u2019s not showing off. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d she searches in her pocket for a word and drags it out like a coin, \u201c\u2014familiar, which is the highest compliment I can pay to a new thing. It reminds me of something I have not eaten before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Ro says, and means it down to her heel bones. The lemon flinch has not shown its face. Somewhere behind the cameras Clare nods at no one and tickmarks something on a list because producers get to keep small scores in their pockets like other people keep mints.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a handshake. It would be indecent this early, and also not the story the tent wants to tell today. There is, though, the ghost of a handshake, which is the thing that happens when his eyes meet yours with approval and you feel the phantom warmth of an offered palm you have held before. Ro keeps the memory where it can\u2019t startle her later and turns to watch Arjun receive a pat on the bench from a host who adores him already, and Celeste accept praise like it came with her lease.\n\nThey reset the tent with the quiet thunder of thirty people doing fifteen things. Signature box checked and carried away with more ceremony than it would get anywhere else on earth, benches scraped of the evidence of nerves, cameras reloaded with more seconds. The hosts, bless them, run into the side tent and emerge with new jokes and slightly different shirts, the way some people change earrings to match the way the day is going. The three finalists are given five minutes to pee and one to look into nothing in particular to remember that they are animals who need water. Ro sips and watches the lemon biscuit tin on the corner of the judges\u2019 table as if it might slide toward her of its own accord. The kind-eyed judge catches her gaze and raises one eyebrow, and Ro feels discovered in a way she is not sorry about.\n\nThe Technical is announced with a degree of glee that makes everyone suspect someone in production won a bet. The blue-eyed judge does the honors, voice like a guillotine dressed in velvet. \u201cFor your Technical Challenge,\u201d he says, and it is capitalized in the air, \u201cwe would like twelve kouign-amann.\u201d The French burred in his mouth makes bakers two counties over flinch. \u201cLayers, lamination, caramelization, patience. Ingredients and a pared-back recipe are under your benches. You have three hours. Begin.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an audible intake that is only half groan. It is cruel and fair in the exact ratio this place likes. Lamination on a timescale that is not moral, sugar waiting like a trap, butter threatening mutiny if you look at it sideways. Ro\u2019s hands move before her brain has fully unstacked the implications. Flour down. Butter in. She slices and arranges and reins in the desire to overwork because the Technical is a god that punishes hubris. The pared-back recipe is a love letter to omission: \u201cMake the dough. Laminate. Turn. Turn. Rest. Sugar. Shape. Prove. Bake until caramelized.\u201d\n\nHer body remembers. It remembers the silk of butter when it is the correct temperature, the way the pin needs to be a weight and a whisper, the way the dough will tell you when it does not consent, and you must stop and let it look out the window for a minute. Her forearms carry the story; the blue apron under the official one warms like a stove brick still holding last night\u2019s heat.\n\nArjun mutters to his butter in Welsh and to his dough in English. It is the most charming spell Ro has ever heard. Celeste works with an aggression that would make duels unnecessary; she whacks coolly, like she has told butter where to go and it obeys out of respect.\n\nThe first turn holds the tent in a quiet that is like being in a church where everyone is secretly listening for the wrong thing. Ro rolls and folds and turns and marks a thumbprint in the corner as she always does\u2014one print means first turn, two means second, three means the edge of triumph and catastrophe. She works quickly and then forces herself to stop when stopping is what saves the day. The temptation to push is a young person\u2019s sin; she has had that smacked out of her by ovens and accidents and the look on her mother\u2019s face when she came home with winter missing.\n\nSugar time is the reckoning. It sifts down like snow over the dough sheets that are now a stratigraphy of effort and physics. It crunches under the pin with a sound that makes something in Ro\u2019s chest match pace. The bench becomes a beach of white that will turn to amber if you treat it with heat and respect. She cuts the squares with a ruler she pretends is not ridiculous, folds corners to center like small parcels you would like to receive from a kind aunt, and nests them into buttered muffin tins that will cradle and then scorch their sides into that marriage of crisp and tender people write sonnets about.\n\nCeleste shapes like a general, efficient and ruthless. She uses a little more sugar than any mortal would, which is a hedge or a flex; it will do one of two things: it will make her the queen, or it will break her teeth. Arjun is methodical to the point of provocation. He whistles something that sounds like his daughter\u2019s whale, and each piece is like the last, a democracy of butter.\n\nProving is a test of nerve. The tent is not the temperature anyone wants it to be; it never is, because weather is a character and she likes to improvise. Ro eyes the proving drawers and spares herself a silent prayer to the god of yeast, who is both petty and generous. She slides her tins in and steps back like a person leaving a room to let someone else finish crying.\n\nThe wait is where people make bad friends with their brains. Ro wipes her bench in obsessive stripes and then stops and forces herself to drink water. The hosts wander in with the energy of two people who cannot be dull at work or their bones will dissolve. One perches and asks Arjun what song he would bake to if the tent let him bring music. He answers with a hymn and a rock ballad and then insists the only correct baking music is the sound of butter becoming something else. The other host lisps at Ro\u2019s sugar strategy with the glee of a raccoon who has discovered the recycling bin and asks whether she will use the spare moment to compose a haiku about caramel. Ro deadpans one into existence and it is actually decent, and the host stamps around pretending to be furious and in love with her, which is exactly what the tent wants at ten past whatever o\u2019clock this is.\n\nWhen the proving is judged acceptable by the way the dough looks proud but not cocky, bakers all over the tent smile in relief that lasts exactly as long as it takes to slide their tins into ovens and realize there is nothing left to do but wait and doubt. Ro presses her palm to the oven door and feels the heat like a promise and a warning. This is the part of baking that has always felt like faith to her; you do the things you can do, and then you step back and let heat and time do theirs, and if you stand there and shout you\u2019ll only scare the yeast. She closes her eyes, just for a blink, and in the blink she is in last year, the shape of the tent around her the same and also not, a run of days where this exact quiet is where she found herself enough times that the quiet started saving her back.\n\nWhen they come out, the room fills with the smell of sugar making a decision to be something better than itself. The sands of time in pastry form cling to the tins; you have to wait the correct number of seconds or you will slide them and pull the skin right off their caramel skins. Celeste waits a fraction too little and a corner resists and tears. Her face does not shift, but her neck muscle leaps like a horse. Arjun mutters a word in Welsh that is not a hymn and not a curse, and then remembers where he is and turns it into a blessing halfway through. Ro waits the way she taught herself, letting the sound resolve into the crisp, the sense that if she shook the tin the pastry would shrug and let go. She knocks hers out with a tremor that is not visible if you don\u2019t know her.\n\nBlind judging goes like a rumor through a small town: brisk, whispery, inevitable. They line theirs up and step back, hands tucked under armpits, water bottles hugged like talismans. The blue-eyed judge slices one, sniffs an inhale of sugar fog, and bites. He does not smile. He points out, for several, the tragedy of a raw center, the sin of stinginess with sugar, the grievous wound of under-lamination. He pauses at one and taps the crisp layer on top with a knife like he is looking for a hollow spot in a wall. \u201cThis,\u201d he says, and he does not need to say more. The kind-eyed judge reads the strata like tea leaves and smiles at one where the sugar has gone mahogany rather than black, approves of a restrained sweetness that allows butter to speak. When they pull the towel on the numbers to reveal names, Arjun is safely second with a praise that lands like a pat on the back strong enough to fix your posture for a week. Celeste, who gambled, finds herself in third with a look that promises vengeance so elegant it will be mistaken for hospitality. Ro is first with a simple, infuriating sentence: \u201cNear perfect.\u201d\n\nShe will not cry. Not in the technical, not over lamination, not while Celeste is in her peripheral vision like the blade of a guillotine she has decided is ornamental. She nods and breathes and Chews Like A Person On Television and shakes Arjun\u2019s hand and even dares to touch Celeste\u2019s elbow lightly, because she is a menace like that, and Celeste glances down at the place where Ro touched her as if wondering whether it will leave a mark you can photograph.\n\nThey are given the fifteen minutes to find dinner that always feels like being let out of school in the middle of winter, everyone running in coats they do not have time to fasten. The canteen puts out a curry that tastes like the cook misses someone and chopped an extra onion to distract herself, and everyone eats in the ravenous, guilty way camera people and bakers eat on set, alive to their own appetites in a way they cannot promise themselves on other days. The crew tries not to have favorites out loud and fails in tiny, human ways that make the tent work: an extra cup of tea placed by a hand that looks like it has been steady for forty years; a paper towel that appears at a moment when someone would have cried over a spill if someone had not handed them a way to not.\n\nThe Showstopper brief lands with the thump of a gift and an obligation. It is, as it should be, absurd: a multi-tiered centerpiece cake that tells the story of your year in four distinct layers, each with a different flavor profile and a different structural demand, with a decorative element that must be edible and must not be embarrassed to stand up in a room with people watching it. The blue-eyed judge says the word narrative in a way that suggests he does not object to it here because food can tell the truth and also look decent while doing it. The kind-eyed judge says, \u201cNo sugar props that will break if someone breathes near them,\u201d in what is clearly a rule made from experience, and eyes every sugar worker in the room, including Ro, until they nod.\n\nThis is where Ro has to make a decision not to narrate last year. The temptation is as seductive as a bowl of batter left alone with a spoon. Every cell in her wants to reference herself with a wink and a nod, to build a meta-cake that acknowledges she has done this already, that she knows where the cameras like to live. But she wrote herself a note weeks ago and underlined the imperative. This time, remember that you love it. She sketches the courthouse square cake, the tiered place where a small town makes its announcements, the limestone of it done in white chocolate ganache pulled with a palette knife, the colors of the seasons in syrups and jellies soaked into sponges you could mistake for clouds with better attitude. Spring lemon with thyme and poppy, summer corn with blackberry, autumn maple and smoke\u2014no, not smoke, that is a fad you subscribe to or don\u2019t and she is not wanting to taste campfire at her own wedding; autum maple and toasted pecan, winter spice with orange and a whisper of something that reminds you of heat even when there isn\u2019t any. The sugar element will be a river of glass running alongside, a narrow ribbon, not a cage, because cages break and make a person look like she loved difficulty for its own sake.\n\nShe goes back to the inn with her notebook and her blue apron folded in two and cannot sleep because sleep is for people not negotiating with themselves in two languages at once. She brings out the biscuit tin the judge slid into her hands when no one was looking and eats one, then two, then tells herself she is saving the third for a catastrophe and immediately eats it because she will not do performative restraint in a room with no witnesses. She writes one word in her notebook and circles it. Joy. She considers crossing it out because it scares her in a way she can\u2019t justify; she leaves it alone and goes to wash her hands because sugar on fingers is the one thing that can convince her to stop writing when writing is the closest she comes to prayer.\n\nMorning rises with a flat golden light that pretends to be kind. The tent welcomes them with that merciless mercy it has, everything laid out and nothing softened. There are cameras everywhere but the crew has the old kindness of looking away when you are trying not to throw up. Clare stands at the back with a clipboard like a general trying to remember the names of all her troops and pretending it is easy. The hosts arrive with coffee in cups that have the wrong names on them, because that is the joke. The judges glide in with the weight of expectation and sunscreen you can smell if you stand close enough. Ro puts the blue apron on under the production one and ties a knot she can undo with one pull if fires or feelings break out.\n\nBatter is easier than truth. She starts with winter at the base because she is contrary and because she wants to build up into spring, not down into it. Spice and orange go into sugar in a ratio that her grandmother would approve of and write a letter about. She beats butter until it forgets who it was. She creams until the mixture sighs. She whisks eggs until they stop falling apart and begin to hold each other. She folds without deflation. The cake tin is lined with a generosity that is practiced kindness, parchment where it needs to be and the tiniest whisper of oil where parchment is a hindrance. She slides it in and starts the next, the corn batter studded with flavor she will beat out of it if she is not careful, the blackberry that will bleed if she jostles it. She is a triage ward and a march. She rotates pans and watches the oven like a person who knows that even the good ovens have personalities and grudges.\n\nArjun builds gentler, a sort of orchard in tiers, apples and pears and soft ginger that smells like an apology and a promise all at once. His sugar work will be caramel lace, something that looks like winter grass under frost. He is whispering again, and if you stand close you hear the shape of a child\u2019s name in the air. Celeste is sculpting with a severity that wishes it were kindness. Her tiers are precise in a way that doors are precise when they close and lock, pistachio bitter balanced on rose that could go gauche and is saved by her good taste. Her decoration will be shards, because she is not afraid of edges, spun sugar pulled into a crown that will either stand like a statement of principle or collapse like a metaphor people will not be able to stop making.\n\nThe tent is a workshop of miracles and errors. Somewhere behind Ro a ganache splits and a baker chokes down a sob and a host descends like a benevolent demon with suggestions and a towel. Briefly, the sun comes out and shirts of people not on camera glow like soft flags. Ro levels layers with a blade that is the width of her own stubbornness, calculates the cooling time with a mathematician\u2019s arrogance and a cook\u2019s fatalism. The lemon syrup in the spring tier has an echo of last night\u2019s biscuits, and when she brushes it on she feels, not a memory, but a future she can have if she keeps surviving the present. The corn layer goes on a level that is so exacting someone would accuse her of using a spirit level if they didn\u2019t know she is simply obsessive and does not require tools once she has taught her eye to behave.\n\nThe kind-eyed judge, who has a gift for appearing when your hands are full and your mouth is free to make a joke that reminds you who you are, loiters by her bench as if she has several other benches to be interested in. \u201cYou\u2019ve decided against cages,\u201d she observes, delicate as a dentist asking whether you\u2019re flossing.\n\n\u201cCages and I had a falling out last season,\u201d Ro says, and the honesty of it lands with the same relief as laughter. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. I never liked them for you,\u201d the judge murmurs, and then catches herself and corrects to, \u201cfor anyone really,\u201d and the slip makes something warm crawl up Ro\u2019s throat like sugar coming to crack. \u201cThis river is sensible and pretty, and I say sensible as a compliment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I let use sensible as a compliment,\u201d Ro says, and the judge\u2019s hand does that small tapping thing near a spoon again, like a heart comforting itself. \u201cAre we allowed side deals, then? You bring me biscuits when I am about to ruin everything, and I will not build sugar prisons in which my cake can die.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only treaty I\u2019m signing this week,\u201d the judge says. Her smile crinkles where the world has been good to her. \u201cCarry on.\u201d\n\nStacking is a religion; you have to have faith in gravity and your own puny engineering. Ro dowels the bottom tier like a person who has built furniture in apartments too small for the furniture she built. She centers. She breathes. She curses once, quietly, because a smear of ganache went where good manners would forbid. She fixes it with a finger and a palette knife and the ruthless honesty of a person cleaning up her own mistakes. The second tier sits. The third. The top is small and pleased with itself, a hat she might wear to a wedding in a town that sells lemon biscuits in tins. The sugar river goes on last, thin and gleaming, tethered invisibly with dots of caramel she pretends are natural adhesion because she does not want to admit to herself that she has learned to lie a little with sugar. The bunting\u2014no, not bunting, too on the nose\u2014she sprinkles the edges with a dusting of powdered something that is not snow and is not sugar and is whatever the part of a year is that lets you sit on your porch in the heat and know life is ending all the time and that this is not an emergency.\n\nCeleste\u2019s crown wobbles and then rights itself with an arrogance that would be illegal in less tolerant countries. Arjun\u2019s caramel lace is a wound and a cobweb and a miracle, and he does not breathe until it sets its own mind. The hosts count them down with that unnatural brightness people use when time is a cliff.\n\n\u201cTime,\u201d the tent says in chorus, and hands go up again. This is a different lifting, a more final one, the sort that lets your armpits know you\u2019re alive. Ro drops hers and looks at what she has done and feels a thing she has not felt since the accident\u2014pride that isn\u2019t posturing. She even lets herself think the word beautiful without crossing it out in the margins of her mind.\n\nJudging is a slow walk, a promenade through the small chapters of other people\u2019s months. Arjun goes first. The knife goes through sponge and everyone in a five-foot radius-eavesdrops on the sound. His flavors are seasonally correct without trimming themselves into oblivion, and the kind-eyed judge calls his ginger polite in a tone that means it is perfectly mannered and also has a personality. Celeste stands like a statue as her cake is unmade with authority. The blue-eyed judge flicks through layers like a bird with taste deciding which branch to land on. He praises the bitterness in her pistachio the way a person praises a villain who made the movie better. He says her crown is ambitious and somehow both tells her he liked it and tells her ambition is not always her friend, and her face does that thing expensive faces do where they preserve themselves for later use.\n\nWhen they reach Ro, the air around the bench changes temperature. She thinks she must be imagining it until the fine hair on her arms reacts like a prairie in a sweep of wind. The judges do their ritual: the sight, the poke, the sniff that is a generosity and a judgment. The first slice is winter, and the spice comes up to meet them like a person who knows how to walk into a room and shake the correct hands. \u201cBalanced,\u201d the blue-eyed judge says, which is such lukewarm praise until you hear the emphasis he puts on the fact of it. The kind-eyed judge speaks first on maple: \u201cYou have no heavy hand,\u201d she says, dipped in something like affection. \u201cYou are not making me remember pancakes. Thank you for that.\u201d\n\nThe lemon layer is the last at the top, and Ro watches the knife go in and hears in her own skull a crack that is not anxiety but release. The zest is there, the thyme doing the job of herbs when herbs are not at a party where they will make a fool of themselves. The judges chew and there is a pause with shape. \u201cYou\u2019ve put yourself on a plate,\u201d the blue-eyed judge says finally, as if accusing her of a crime and forgiving her at the same time. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve not apologized for it.\u201d The kind-eyed judge has a look on her face Ro would like to frame and take home and hang above her couch where only she can see it. \u201cIt tastes,\u201d she says quietly, \u201clike you wanted to be here.\u201d\n\nFor a second the tent dissolves around the edges like a memory and reasserts itself like a fact. Ro nods because she cannot say anything else, and because she has spent months making the sound yes into a bridge and it is holding. She feels the spoon with the crescent burn mark on the bench behind her as a possibility and a problem she already solved. She feels Celeste\u2019s gaze like weather. She feels, under her layers of apron, the stitch of the blue fabric like a familiar hand at her spine, and she thinks, ridiculous and entirely accurate, that she loves this and is allowed to love it.\n\nThey line them up like suspects and lovers. The hosts do their jokes and then do their looking that isn\u2019t jokes. There is a speech about journeys that manages to avoid clich\u00e9 through sheer force of sincerity and because the people hearing it have flour in their hair. The decision lands where it lands. Arjun is given third with a tenderness that insists he has won something he\u2019ll get in the mail later and keep in his drawer near the good napkins. Celeste is second with an expression that would be dangerous if placed on a highway. She is too good to do anything but turn this into a plan. There is applause that is not polite; it is the applause people give to an argument well made even if they had staked money on the other side.\n\nRo is first, and it is not a coronation and it is not inevitable and it is not even a narrative, it is simply true in the way certain flavors are true in your mouth. The blue-eyed judge extends his hand with the weight of the world\u2019s oddest sacrament, and this is a new shake, not a remembrance, and she takes it and it is dry and human and less electric than legends would have you believe and also everything legends require. The kind-eyed judge puts her palm briefly to Ro\u2019s forearm, a touch so light a person who did not know human bodies would miss it, and says, \u201cWell done,\u201d like an entire chapter of a book.\n\nThe tent stands down. The air lets out. Someone somewhere cries in a bathroom for three minutes and composes themselves with paper towels and returns with a joke. A sound tech wraps their cables like pasta forks. Clare puts her head against a pole and therefore catches her breath because this is her cathedral and her gym. Arjun presses a sticky kiss to Ro\u2019s cheek and calls her sister and means it, and Ro returns the title and means it more than she expected to. Celeste lingers, which is not her habit unless she has intentions. She looks at Ro\u2019s blue apron peeking like a secret and says, in a tone that would get her away with anything, \u201cYou won last year. You won today. It must be boring being you.\u201d\n\nRo laughs because that is the only thing that will make this a conversation and not a speech. \u201cIt is never boring being a person who forgets winter and has to court lemon all over again,\u201d she says. \u201cYou should try it. Keeps things fresh.\u201d\n\nCeleste\u2019s mouth does not change, but the line from her temple to her jaw confess something. \u201cWe\u2019re not finished,\u201d she says, and it isn\u2019t a threat so much as a scheduling note. \u201cThere\u2019s more life.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Ro says, gentle and feral. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d\n\nLater, after the de-mic and the hug she pretends not to give to a host and the producers\u2019 congratulations that come in packets of compliments designed to avoid making her a person who will be unbearable to feed, she walks out into the field where the day has decided to be evening without a scene change. The tents look smaller when you step away; the bunting, now moving, makes a noise like the hem of a dress. The kind-eyed judge is out there too, unsurprised by her own presence outdoors, hands in the pockets of a jacket that has seen other seasons. They do that thing two people do when standing near each other would be a decision and standing apart feels like a story about caution that neither of them asked to tell.\n\n\u201cWalk?\u201d the judge offers, singular, the opposite of dangerous, and Ro says yes before thinking about what parts of the internet would make of a yes that is not about cake. They walk the length of a hedge that is more opinion than plant. A flock of birds does a motion that looks like thought. The judge tucks her hair behind her ear and says, as if she had been saving it for when there was grass under them and no camera lenses in the hedgerows, \u201cYou were very brave to come back.\u201d\n\nRo swallows. The lump is everything the day put in her throat that could not be swallowed at the time. \u201cI was very afraid to,\u201d she says, because the old habits of editing herself fall away out here where the syllables can go somewhere. \u201cI didn\u2019t come back on purpose. I think I tripped and landed here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how most of us end up anywhere decent,\u201d the judge says. Her smile is not a consolation. It is an admission. \u201cI cannot be anything but myself in that tent, which is unfortunate on certain days and fortunate on others. I am telling you this because it is maddening to be treated like weather when you are in fact a person who is always misplacing her reading glasses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not call you weather,\u201d Ro promises, and then hears what she has promised and wants to walk it back and does not. \u201cI will call you\u2014\u201d she stops, because names are power and also because she is not alone in this story even if it keeps pinning her to the center. \u201cI will call you kind and expect you to prove me right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the worst technical,\u201d the judge says, mostly to herself. She looks at Ro and something in her face goes more careful. \u201cYou will be all right,\u201d she adds, not like a palliative, like a dare.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ro says, and she does, briefly and then more fully and then briefly again, as truth comes in waves. She thinks she could say something foolish about lemon biscuits and rivers of sugar and maps, so she closes her mouth and lets the grass do some talking and lets the wind rattle the tent ropes and decides that chapter five of this particular book ends not with an oven door closing or a slow-motion bite, but with two people walking in a field pretending not to measure their steps to each other\u2019s.",

The tent sits there fatted with silence, like a creature that has eaten and is purring. Ro and the judge make it as far as the tree with the deliberate shade and stop because there is nothing beyond it but more of the same green in variations and the sense that if they kept walking, they would fall off the edge of the episode and into regular air. The judge\u2019s shoes sink a fraction into the soft earth and leave two careful ovals that will baffle a rabbit later. Ro presses her heel down and lifts it again, amused by the shape of her own tread, which looks like someone tried to stamp a direction into the ground and thought better of it.\n\n\u201cDo they make you go to the party,\u201d Ro asks, not because she doesn\u2019t know but because she wants to hear whether anyone else calls it that.\n\n\u201cThey make me,\u201d the judge says, and her mouth does that thing where it agrees and also you can tell she would go anyway. \u201cThere is a ritual speech about the magic of ordinary ingredients. There is a tray of sausages that always runs out in a way that suggests someone is siphoning them off to a secret sausage lair. There will be glasses. People will do that Mid-Atlantic shouting that is meant to be casual. You will try to be gracious and end up being you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could be worse,\u201d Ro says. \u201cI could start gin rants.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen gin rants,\u201d the judge says, grim authority in her eyes softened by what must be memory. \u201cI will fetch you before you get to that stage.\u201d\n\nThey turn back because they must. The tent grows in their peripheral vision like a promise that has already been kept, and the edges of the world go back to where the edges belong. Someone\u2019s child, who does not know about embargoes or the sacredness of footage, streaks across the lawn in a shirt with dinosaurs that grin like they have baked today and are good at it. Arjun sits on a camp chair that looks like it has been there since the first time someone put a tablecloth on a table and called it television, and he is on the phone leaning into a voice that makes his shoulders low and his face young. Celeste is a stillness leaned against a pole as if that is what poles are for, scrolling with the intensity of a person who thinks information is a resource you can mine until the seam gives. The production assistants move like a shoal, flicking tape and wires, giggling without apology. Clare, clipboard aloft like a censer, catches Ro\u2019s eye and tilts her chin toward the catering tent, which smells like meat and celebration and a mild disaster averted.\n\nThe party is what it always is, which is a group of tired people over-complimenting finger food to keep from over-complimenting each other until they break and do it anyway. There is a table for the crew with a sign that says crew and another table for the talent with a sign that says talent, and in twenty minutes no one will be observing those divisions. Ro allows herself, for a whole hour, to be carried on the fact of having done it without boring herself by recounting it. She nods in the rhythm of congratulations designed by people who have shaken many hands and would like to be at home with their socks off. Someone sets a beer in front of her that is lighter than she prefers, and someone else replaces it with something stout as if stout could be a bandage.\n\nArjun finds her with both hands out. His laugh has reverted to the cell-deep one that made her like him twenty seconds into knowing he existed. \u201cSister,\u201d he says, not looking to see whether anyone is listening for that intimacy. \u201cMy daughter is making me bring you home so she can test whether you are real. She insists whales will be part of this test. Prepare a whale fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am full of whale facts,\u201d Ro says, and then has to rummage. \u201cTheir earwax\u2014no, their earwax has layers and you can count the layers like rings in a tree to know their age.\u201d She sees him wince in delight and declares it a success. \u201cTell her Arjun\u2019s friend can be dated by pastry layers, though. Earwax is unromantic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll translate,\u201d he promises. Under the fairy lights his hair looks like the way old silver catches light. \u201cMy wife says when she saw you put your hand flat on the bench before you started, she knew you were going to be all right. She says that is how her grandmother used to calm herself before kneading. Palm down, hello wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a religion,\u201d Ro says, swallowing around something that would be sentiment if it dressed itself. \u201cI like your wife already.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will,\u201d he says, sure as physics.\n\nCeleste approaches the way a cat approaches a friend\u2019s dog it has decided to tolerate. She does not hold a drink, which is either discipline or a strategy to keep her hands available as punctuation. Her face is its usual essay of control and intent, but tonight there is a tiny unravel at the edge of her left eyebrow, as if an expression she didn\u2019t authorize has leaked out and spent itself. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d she says, and it could be acid and it is not. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend you didn\u2019t do something beautiful because politeness is an ugly dress on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d pay to see you pretend,\u201d Ro says. \u201cBut this is better.\u201d\n\nCeleste shifts, the small change you make when you decide not to defend a fortress. \u201cYou were softer this time,\u201d she says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t an insult. Your work was always clean, but you used to make it stand up and salute. Today it looked like you trusted it to be looked at.\u201d\n\nRo chews this as if it is food dense enough to reward chewing. \u201cI forgot some things,\u201d she says, wishing, for once, that she did not feel compelled to explain, and explaining anyway. \u201cThen I had to want them again without remembering why. I think it made my hands kinder to me.\u201d\n\nCeleste looks at the tent as if she might pick it up with both hands and tilt it. \u201cI liked you better when you were an idiot I could hate without consequence,\u201d she says, so flatly that Ro laughs. \u201cThis is very inconvenient. I\u2019m going to have to up my budget for therapy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll invoice you,\u201d Ro offers, and Celeste\u2019s mouth tips, and the look in her eyes is almost relief.\n\nThe judge circulates with the efficient benevolence of a host at a wedding for people who once burned sugar together. When she comes near Ro, she doesn\u2019t stop right away; she just lets her shoulder brush Ro\u2019s in a way that could be accident and is not. Later, she delivers the magic-of-ingredients speech with practiced humor and an unsentimental affection that makes the grip around Ro\u2019s sternum give, an eighth of an inch, which is a country mile if you are measuring from where she started. There is also a paragraph about good television having ethics, about editing as an act of respect, and Ro watches the crew watch her with the attention of apprentices who have chosen their masters with care.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone turn you into a brand you can\u2019t stand to eat,\u201d the judge says into her glass, and there it is: the line Ro writes down later inside her own skull where it can\u2019t be edited for a press release.\n\nBack at the inn the floorboards betray every future ghost with opinions. Ro\u2019s room smells faintly of party linger and fern. The blue apron is a folded sky at the foot of the bed, and the spoon with the crescent mark lies on the nightstand like a stubborn moon. She sits on the edge of the mattress and studies her hands like a fortune-teller who has already told herself the worst and is now trying to believe the good. The door knocks twice, fast, the way a postman might, which is why she knows it\u2019s Mina before she even crosses the room.\n\nThe phone screen ricochets her best friend\u2019s face into the dimness, makes it overbright. Mina is in Indiana night, with a mug and somebody else\u2019s cat on her shoulder like a high-collared cape. \u201cAre you alive,\u201d Mina demands, then swears with the relish of someone who delayed swearing for twelve hours and now has a backlog. \u201cAre you\u2014 are you okay? Do you need a plane I cannot afford to arrive and wrap you up and bring you home? Because I will commit crimes. They will be small crimes, but I will do them enthusiastically.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a cake,\u201d Ro says. It is not the answer to any question, and it is the only answer. \u201cI made a courthouse and didn\u2019t get arrested.\u201d\n\nMina narrows her eyes and then goes soft at the edges, which is how you know she is not pretending to be a velociraptor for the sake of her own entertainment. \u201cDo you feel like you now,\u201d she asks, carefully, as if the answer will rearrange the cabinets.\n\n\u201cI feel like a person with sugar under her nails and good applause in her ears who is going to sleep until the bus driver in the morning picks me up like a sack of flour,\u201d Ro says. \u201cI feel like I might let the apron hang on a hook when I get home. I feel like I am going to cry if I say the word winner in front of a mirror, and also I\u2019m not going to break. Does that count.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt counts for everything,\u201d Mina says, decisively, and the cat headbutts her chin like an endorsement. \u201cBloomington is already making rumors out of air. Harriet says fifty-seven people asked her if she knows whether you made something controversial with corn. I told her the only controversial thing you ever did with corn was steal a bag of kettle corn off a raccoon at the fair and win. I have never loved you more. Call me in the morning so I can yell at you about airport sandwiches.\u201d\n\nRo promises because promising is how you make paths across days. Before bed she unfolds the blue apron and hangs it on the wardrobe knob and watches it take up its small jurisdiction and feels the crazy, sane sense that she has hung part of last year back up in her life where it belongs. She opens the biscuit tin to find the paper liner, now mostly crumbs, gaudy with sugar and the wet gleam of lemon oil. She licks one finger and picks up a grain the size of resolution. Sleep comes fast and keeps a hand on the small of her back like a person shepherding her toward the door of morning.\n\nThe morning makes itself plain with English light and a knock that means the driver is on time and a polite voice on the stairs announcing that luggage has opinions. Ro packs with the ruthless tenderness of someone storing relics. The spoon is getting cocky about being a symbol; she tucks it in on top of the A to Z of London she bought for no reason other than that maps make her feel capable. She folds the blue apron and places it with the engraved whisk, and when her fingers brush the letters they hum with the quiet bell of permanence. She leaves a note for housekeeping that says thank you in small neat cursive and an extra thanks for the nice soap because kindness to the cleaners is a family rule that never expires.\n\nAt the field there are goodbyes that pretend not to be goodbyes, clapped shoulders and the exchange of numbers written down in three places so you do not have to pretend later you cannot find them. Arjun hugs her like he trusts she will not break him with the force of it, and his eyes are damp because he is a person who carries salt water like it is useful. \u201cCome to Cardiff,\u201d he says. \u201cI will make you eat Welsh cakes until you cry for mercy, and then my aunt will come over to insist on a second round. Bring Mina or we will talk about her until you feel guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am terrified of your aunt and also in love with her,\u201d Ro says, which is a fair review of many aunts.\n\nCeleste does not hug. She steps close enough that their shoulders nearly become one body and says, \u201cDo not become a story someone else tells about themselves at your expense.\u201d It is a gift wrapped like a threat. \u201cAlso, when you come to New York, call me. Do not show up without warning; I will forgive you and then never let you forget you were uncivilized.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you accept offerings,\u201d Ro asks. \u201cI can bring pie.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you bring pie I will stab you with a fork and then feed it to you,\u201d Celeste says, like poetry.\n\nClare appears the way leaders appear, suddenly and in the place where you need them. She tucks a folded paper into Ro\u2019s palm, something that looks bureaucratic and is not, and squeezes once like a semaphore for good weather. \u201cYour embargo email will be waiting for you by the time you land,\u201d she says. \u201cDo the opposite of what your heart wants for six weeks and tell no one the important thing. We will send you back here for a pickup if we must change one microscopic shot of your hand whisking. You were a joy and a schedulable adult. We love schedulable adults. Please do not forget to drink water for the remainder of your natural life.\u201d\n\nOn the way to the airport, hedges reassert themselves as the continents of this nation. The driver has a radio show on where people phone in to confess crimes committed by baked potatoes. Ro stares out at the versions of green and tries to fit herself back into the container of a person who is going to sit in the sky for seven hours. In the seat pocket she finds a safety card and imagines herself drawing a lemon on it where the diagram says pull. She closes her eyes and sees not cameras, not bunting, not even the judge\u2019s mouth or the blue eye\u2019s half-smile; she sees a slab of limestone warmed by sun and cool under her palm, a building that looks like a courthouse and insists it is a bakery, and a maple leaf turning its face to the light like what else is it for.\n\nAirports are cruel to glory. She is grateful. She buys a terrible sandwich and holds it as if it is a necessary sin. She texts her mother from the gate, a sentence that is half code and half shout. Made four layers and didn\u2019t die, she types. Lemon is no longer a war. I am bringing home biscuits that don\u2019t exist. Her mother writes back with the exact number of exclamation points her mother would use to tell someone about a grandson\u2019s good haircut, then follows with a photo of the antique shop staging a small parade of ceramic geese near the register. The geese are wearing ribbon. One goose has a tiny paper crown on its head that says RO in minuscule block letters. The caption is unpunctuated and magnificent: your kingdom awaits.\n\nOn the plane the universe goes white, then black, then blue. The hum buoys her in that way that makes you feel both inconsequential and exempt. She opens the notebook to a page near the back and writes a letter to herself because letters have become the way she saves her own life without making a fuss. Dear Ro, it begins, as if she were someone else. Today you put lemon back in your mouth and it didn\u2019t bite. Today you did not make a prison and call it a showpiece. Today you asked your hands to remember you and they did. If you forget again, you are allowed. The ribbon in the tin was yellow. The judge\u2019s kindness is not policy, it is a person. Do not kiss pictures. Eat breakfast. When you get home, hang up the apron. Leave the spoon on the stove. Let winter in when it arrives, and be friends with it if you can.\n\nNewark smells like a mall that married an airplane. She thinks she sees a man from Bloomington who sells knives on Saturdays at the farmer\u2019s market, and it is not him, and it makes her laugh enough she looks like a very cheerful lunatic. The Indianapolis flight is crowded with people who have never baked on television and do not care to hear about it. There is a child in the row behind her who kicks the seat with the singular conviction of tiny children and drummers, and she almost turns to ask him for a rhythm to whisk to and then thinks better of it because she is tired and kindness has to bring its own sauce or it dries out.\n\nBloomington is the word her heart says under its breath when it wants to feel like something fits. Mina is at the airport because of course she is, and Theo has found a way to stand directly in the path of baggage as if it will not force him to move. Harriet is not there because Harriet believes in the theater of the unexpected; instead there is a note on Ro\u2019s front door when she gets to it later that says Keys. Passport. Forgiveness. Hothouse tomatoes, half price. The maple has gone gold in places and green in others, undecided like a teenager growing hips. The porch swing is a sulk; it has missed her and has chosen to show it by making more noise than it needs to.\n\n\u201cYou look like someone who got in a fistfight with a cloud,\u201d Mina says, and wraps her in a hug that resets the hinges on Ro\u2019s ribs. \u201cDid you bring me anything illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought you international crumbs,\u201d Ro says, and Mina takes the biscuit tin with reverence and places it on the table as though it refuses to be empty. \u201cI also brought you an entire country\u2019s opinion about pastry. We can ignore it if we want.\u201d\n\nThey do not talk about who won, which is the small hard miracle of discipline. They talk instead about the lady at the clay studio who said the word kiln like it had killed her husband. They talk about Theo\u2019s coach deciding the pool is flirting with algae, as if algae has coyness. They talk about a raccoon who has discovered the diner\u2019s dumpster and is making it his work to embarrass them. They eat eggs because eggs are both breakfast and apology. Ro touches the hook by the door with the back of her finger and then hangs the blue apron there, slow as faith.\n\nThat first week stretches and contracts like dough under the hand. The embargo sits on her tongue like a bead of sugar not yet melted, dangerous only if you are careless. The town senses a weather event and pretends to be blas\u00e9. People tip more and ask less. Hank sprays down tables with theatrical righteousness and mutters something about the paparazzi, and a woman at the counter whose hair has known three decades of peroxide says, as she pins a lottery scratch-off to the corkboard, that her nephew\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s cousin swears they saw Ro shaking a famous hand and that this means Indiana is going to be on the map and that the map should be pink. Ro pulls a croissant sheet and says, \u201cWe have always been on a map,\u201d and the woman considers this the way you consider whether a hat is your color and decides to buy it.\n\nHer mother drives over on Thursday with a bag of pears that smell like regret and sugar. She stands in the kitchen doorway and watches the apron on the hook as if it might introduce itself. Ro pulls out the box from under the bed even though the items in it have been redistributed, and they sit on the floor like teenagers, picking over the remains of an era that is simultaneously ongoing and old. They take the photograph out again, and this time they both look at it until their eyes stop being wet. They let the word winner sit between them like a bowl on a table. It doesn\u2019t drown them; it is less deep and more steady than they were prepared for. Her mother says, \u201cI kept trying to fit the year into a coat you would want to wear. It is a difficult size,\u201d and Ro leans her head on her mother\u2019s knee like a child who will not apologize for being a child in her mother\u2019s house.\n\nThey start saying last year out loud. It makes a difference. It moves the last winter from the drawer under the towels into the cupboard with the mugs. The smell of lemon in the diner stops being a knife and becomes a practice. She uses thyme twice in one day and no one breaks their own heart. Mina comes back from the clay studio with the loaf-shaped mug fired into a permanent smile and puts it on the shelf by the window where the light can enter it. The mug looks like an object that will save someone\u2019s life by being the correct size for their hand.\n\nThe show will air in a few weeks, and then the town will have another party, and then a different one. There will be phone calls with producers and a calendar that suggests Ro knows how to be in two places at once and a publicist somewhere who attempts to train her to say three phrases in interview like a minor magic trick. The judge will send one perfect sentence to her inbox that says, Without sugar, but you, and Ro will read it once and then put her phone face down and go stack chairs at closing because weight and repetition have always made more sense to her than anyone\u2019s idea of fate.\n\nCeleste texts a photo of a pastry box tied with red string and the words You are not allowed to eat this until you admit defeat at Scrabble, which settles the question of what kind of friends they are going to be. Arjun sends a voice note of his daughter listing sea creatures in a serious voice that makes every word its own entity. Harriet installs a tiny bell under the hook with the blue apron so it rings when someone tries to steal it, and there are attempts which are thwarted by the sound of foolishness ringing true.\n\nAt night Ro sits on the porch with the maple donating privacy and the cricket choir bringing their long song. She writes again, because paper is how she keeps track of the parts of herself that will argue if left alone in the back. She begins with a recipe and keeps going after the ingredients are done because it feels like something useful. Butter, she writes, and does not put a quantity. Sugar, she writes, and adds patience. Eggs, she writes, and adds don\u2019t overtalk them. Flour, she writes, and adds what you have in the cupboard. Lemon, she writes, and adds courage. Thyme, she writes, and adds what love really is; you add it to the end and it changes the whole thing.\n\nThe maple releases a leaf with the exact theatrics of a person finishing a solo. Somewhere in the town, someone flips through channels and will one day stop because they see a familiar person in a white tent with a spoon that has a crescent burn. Somewhere else, someone will taste corn in cake and write an email using words Ro will not recognize and will keep anyway because keeping kindness is polite. In her kitchen, the apron hangs and does not accuse anyone. The whisk waits for morning. The oven will want to be fed. The air is sweet because Bloomington has forgiven everything that can be forgiven and is saving the rest in jars. Ro stands up because the night is a chapter break. She rinses a bowl because she is not a monster. She goes to bed knowing the exact taste of lemon on a good day and thinks, finally, the same thought the tent made her have until it stuck: some things rise even if you aren\u2019t looking. Some things rise because you are.",

                              "content": "The week before the episode airs, Bloomington behaves like a person about to sneeze. Conversations begin with ordinary news and end with glances that try not to say anything, which is how you know they\u2019re saying everything. Hank invents new methods of wiping down tables that all culminate in him leaning on the counter and asking whether the legal term embargo is Latin for suffering. Harriet prepares for a watch party while insisting there will be no party, then orders twice as much coffee as usual and pretends it is because bean shipments have their own weather. Theo stops by between practices under the pretext of returning a mug he definitely stole and leaves a bag with swimmer snacks and a note that reads for your nervous system and also your mouth, which is almost poetry.\n\nThe mug from ceramics night comes back from the kiln like a small miracle that kept its promises. The glaze is the exact wrong beige suddenly right in this shape, warm and bread-ish, with a darker brown pooled where the scores are, like a loaf has blushed. Mina presents it with the gravity of a midwife and sets it on the counter where the light can put its hand inside. Ro picks it up and discovers her fingers fall into the grooves she cut without thinking, and the contact steadies her faster than any pep talk. She pours coffee into it that tastes like the middle of the alphabet and drinks standing up, because sitting is a negotiation she will lose.\n\nHer mother drives over two days before air with a cake she calls emergency and says is not what you think. It is dense and lemon-scented without being lemon, and it holds up to frosting like a person who does not wilt easily. They sit at the kitchen table with the cake between them and the blue apron on the hook like a flag hung at half mast for a private holiday. Her mother says, \u201cMy friend Irene asked if the show will show the handshake,\u201d and Ro says, \u201cIf it does, I won\u2019t look at my face,\u201d and her mother says, \u201cI will look at your face for you in case it does anything rude,\u201d and this, too, is a family tradition masquerading as a new idea.\n\nRo cleans, because cleaning is a language she speaks fluently when other languages fail. The walk-in gleams. The flour bin shines with a thin coat of powder that will always return no matter how many cloths you seek out to exile it with. She organizes the spice drawer with precision bordering on satire, lines the jars like soldiers, put cumin next to coriander to keep its world view in check, and stores the thyme in front where she can see it. She says the word out loud once, to test it. It has stopped being the name of a plant and started being an instruction, which is not unlike faith.\n\nThe embargo is a pebble she keeps under her tongue to remind herself not to overshare. People throw questions like children throw bread to ducks\u2014small, well-intended, a little greedy. She ducks or opens her mouth and lets crumbs dissolve harmlessly. When someone asks at the farmers market, \u201cDid you get to keep any of the equipment,\u201d she laughs and tells them the tent is a dragon who sleeps on its hoard and bites thieves. When a child asks, serious and unblinking, \u201cDid it smell like cookies the whole time,\u201d she says, \u201cIt smelled like nerves and lemon and electricity and yes,\u201d and the child nods, satisfied, and goes back to a carrot as if carrots were chapters in a book that cannot be put down.\n\nOn the day, Grackle\u2019s is full by an honest accident that fools no one. People show up with excuses like \u201cI always eat here at eight\u201d and \u201cmy cousin said the biscuits taste better when televised.\u201d Harriet proclaims this a fire hazard and brings out extra chairs, which is how you know it\u2019s love. Mina hangs a banner that reads nothing, actually nothing, just a row of blue triangles, because words have been outlawed for the day. Hank makes popcorn the way a marching band plays a fight song, with unnecessary volume and a conviction that keeps the air from doing anything tragic. Theo arrives with a small cooler that turns out to be full of ice and fear, which they agree to share.\n\nThe television on the wall has never looked so official. Someone pins a tea towel over the corner of the screen to hide the channel logo because no one wants to get caught accidentally doing a brand deal. The volume is set low enough that the diner can keep being a diner around it. The first shots ripple. There is the field in England pretending to be every field at once. There are tents that have faces if you look long enough. There are hands you recognize before you recognize your own chins. There are the judges, and the hosts, and then there is the roster of finalists with their names blooming in the bottom third, and the room does that thing where it gets both louder and quieter, as if sound has found a way to spread and behave.\n\nRo watches herself arrive, which is a special kind of magic trick. The editing is kind. It remembers she is funny without turning her into a joke, and it lets her quiets have their shape. The spoon with the crescent burn mark gets a close-up that makes the diner murmur like a small congregation. Mina elbows her with a gentleness practiced over two decades and whispers, \u201cYou are televisually tolerable,\u201d which is Mina calling you the queen. Her mother texts at the exact moment the lemon tarts come into frame and says, on a delay that feels like a blessing, your hands look like home.\n\nThere is a moment, during the Signature, when the camera lingers on her face as the lemon curd sets. On the screen, her expression swims. She looks concentrations of a woman who forgot something and is trying to remember it with fruit. Watching herself look like that makes the actual her feel the old flinch at the base of her skull, then watch it pass without catching. The room clucks in unison when the judge calls the thyme not-shouting, as if the judge speaks directly to the communal part of their Midwestern soul. When he says excellent with a mouth that resists adjectives, there is a flash of pride so large and ridiculous that Ro holds the edge of the table so as not to float.\n\nShe does not prepare for how it feels to watch the Technical, because you cannot rehearse and also you cannot be told. The editors make a symphony of butter and time. Celeste is sharp and beautiful and sharp again. Arjun\u2019s whispered Welsh is subtitled and becomes a chorus. Ro\u2019s thumbprints on the dough corners are caught by a camera that loves them more than she knew it could. When they lift the towel and her name lands on the first marker, there is applause that makes the windows vibrate and a noise from her mother that sounds like a kettle announcing a boil. Ro laughs and hides her face and then makes herself unhide her face, because she has worked too hard to disappear when the good happens.\n\nThe showstopper is a cathedral sliced. Seeing the courthouse square come together in edited time is like watching magic claim it has always been science. The corn layers look like what she wanted them to look like in a way that does not make sense, and the sugar ribbon is thinner on TV than in her memory, which is lucky. The judges say what they said, but the edit also captures the moment when the kind-eyed judge\u2019s hand hovered near Ro\u2019s wrist. It is visible only if you are looking for it and impossible to unsee once you know it\u2019s there. Mina sees it. Mina squeezes Ro\u2019s knee under the table and does not turn to look at her, which is how you get away with being loyal in public.\n\nThere is a sound in the diner that has never occurred here before, a collective breath held like a plate you do not want to drop. The handshake arrives new\u2014the second first one of her life\u2014and even on screen, even under careful cameras, it looks like two people decided to be proud of the same thing for one full second. Harriet does the thing where she pretends to drop a spoon so she can bend and hide her face and take a breath. Hank says a word under his breath that is not appropriate for a family establishment and then says, louder, \u201cI am so proud of our croissant dad,\u201d and Theo covers his face with his hands like a goalie who has just realized the ball is a cake.\n\nBloomington is the happiest kind of loud. The applause breaks seem to invent themselves. People clap at shots of corn as if corn is the protagonist of the season. They clap when the bunting ripples. They clap for Arjun piping and bake patience and for Celeste\u2019s crown, because they are not petty with their praise even if they mutter later that her hair does look like a knife. Someone starts a chant that fizzles because this is not that kind of town, and it turns into laughter so genuine even the griddle seems to blush. Ro surfaces between tidal surges of attention like a person learning to breathe in a slightly different climate. She lets the noise pass over her because fighting it is a waste of arms.\n\nAfter the credits crawl by like slow boats, the diner does the thing families do: everyone makes too much of nothing for five minutes to avoid having to say big things. Coffee is poured into cups that are already full. Someone declares the popcorn revolutionary. A man at the counter whose usual topic is auto parts adverts says, \u201cI always thought sugar work was frivolous, but those shards could have cut a pipe,\u201d and looks embarrassed when he realizes he sounds impressed. The geese in the antique shop photo have their little RO crown passed from phone to phone, and the crown grows fifteen percent with every retelling. Ro grins until her face hurts and then keeps at it, because the muscle knows now how certain aches are good.\n\nWhen the crowd thins and the mop bucket comes out like a chaperone enforcing curfew, Ro slips out the side door to where the alley meets the lot and the maples along the alley draw lines against the night. The air is cooling into something she can stand close to without being burned by the day in it. She leans her shoulder against the brick and rests her head back and considers whether she can feel her heartbeat in the mortar. She can. She tries the sentence out loud because the alley is a better confidant than the bathroom and because hearing herself say things has turned out to be practical magic. \u201cI did it again,\u201d she says, and then adds, \u201cI did it,\u201d in case again is too heavy.\n\nMina appears the way cats appear when you are trying to feel a feeling alone and need supervision. She has a beer in one hand and two cookies in the other, and she hands Ro one like slow medicine. \u201cIf you run, I\u2019m going to chase you,\u201d she says, pressing her shoulder where Ro\u2019s shoulder is. \u201cI brought my sensible shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running,\u201d Ro says. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014processing.\u201d\n\n\u201cProcessing is running with good posture,\u201d Mina declares. She takes a sip from the bottle and makes a face because the beer is the wrong kind of wrong and that offends her. \u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuiet,\u201d Ro says, surprised and not. \u201cThere was a moment when I saw me seeing the lemon and thought I might sprint into traffic. Then I didn\u2019t. The TV threw me a biscuit across time, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cKinky,\u201d Mina says, and then does not make the obvious joke, for which Ro is grateful. \u201cYou were beautiful in there. Not like, cover shoot, though you can do that too. I mean the kind of beautiful when someone is holding joy like they finally got instructions.\u201d\n\nRo nods and keeps her eyes on the little lake of oil near the dumpster that always looks like a galaxy. \u201cWhen she said it tasted like I wanted to be there,\u201d she says, \u201cI thought, okay. If I can\u2019t keep much else, I can keep that wanting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get to have more than wanting,\u201d Mina says. \u201cYou get to have doing. And done.\u201d She taps the cookie against Ro\u2019s cookie like a toast. \u201cAlso, there\u2019s a small woman at your table who will not leave until she speaks to you about your corn usage, and I am not a bouncer even if I own a jacket that makes me look like a bouncer. Come inside and let her love you with too much enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nThey go, and Ro survives four more compliments and a photo with a baby who sleeps through the flash like a grown-up. She stands at the register after close counting tips with Harriet because this is one way to unfloat, and Harriet fits bills into neat piles with the same energy she would devote to mediation or the careful rescue of a spider. \u201cYour mother cried into my egg salad,\u201d Harriet reports, looking pleased in a way that means she will never admit to being pleased. \u201cIt is fine; it needed salt. I am calling the food distributor tomorrow and yelling in a loving tone about tofu, because that is how I celebrate.\u201d\n\nIn the days that follow, the internet remembers where Bloomington is, and Bloomington pretends to be unimpressed. People who once posted photos of their cats now post pictures of their televisions paused on Ro\u2019s face with captions like our baker and I knew her when and I taught her eighth grade math except this is a lie and we met at a garage sale. Celeste posts a carousel of behind-the-scenes shots with a rare photo of her laughing that looks less like a sharp thing and more like a person who was told a joke by someone who meant it. Arjun\u2019s daughter writes WHALE FACTS in marker on a piece of paper and holds it up in a video where she lists the names of whales like a litany and adds Rosa as if that is one.\n\nAn envelope arrives at the diner two mornings after airing with a London stamp and handwriting that has gotten away with being elegant by being illegible. Inside there is a recipe card written in the kind-eyed judge\u2019s compact script on a clean, serious card. The title at the top reads Lemon Biscuits, Saunders Family, and below it the ingredients and a note that says, in parentheses, add thyme if you\u2019re in that mood, and under the line about zest, an instruction in a crooked arrow: You are not obligated to flinch. At the bottom, a postscript drawn in a box says: Without sugar, but you. Ro puts the card in her notebook and does not read it again for two days because she has the superstition that if she reads it three times the words will evaporate.\n\nCeleste sends a box tied with red string not two hours later, as if she has a tracker on the judge\u2019s mailbox. Inside are four pastries that are identical and an aggressive note that reads If you admit in good faith that I beat you at pistachio, I will come to your town and let you beat me at corn. There is also a Scrabble tile bag. Ro texts back a photograph of the loaf mug, full of coffee, with the box in the background and the note propped against the handle like a pennant. She writes Bring your fork. Don\u2019t bring your knives. Celeste\u2019s typing bubble appears and disappears as if she is negotiating with herself about what counts as flirting.\n\nIn the late afternoons when the humidity goes out to smoke and the light gets honest, Ro takes the recipe card out onto the porch and copies it in her own hand. She says the measurements like a poem. She bakes the biscuits at midnight when the oven can be the only loud thing in the room, and the smell wakes up the upstairs neighbor and a raccoon which has learned to sit politely by the door and pretend it is a cat. She puts a plate in the fridge for her mother with a sticky note that reads do not be reasonable about how many you eat, and another for Harriet labeled tell no one. The third plate she sets on her own table and eats standing up, then sitting, then with her elbows on her knees, letting the lemon go through her without an argument.\n\nHer memory does not come back with trumpets. It has no interest in narrative tidiness. What happens is she reaches for a whisk and her hand remembers a rhythm it liked, and she counts to the right number without knowing why. She passes a display of candied citrus in the grocery and her body does not stiffen. She smells bleach and thinks of a tent her brain insists on populating with bunting, but the thought does not knock her down. When she wakes up late on a Tuesday having dreamed of being on camera and wearing the wrong shoes, she puts her feet on the floor and the panic refuses to sit in her lap. She understands, with a mix of relief and resignation, that this is how most things mend: the scab forms, and you want to pick it, and you don\u2019t, and one day you notice skin where there was not skin. The scar is a fact; it is not an argument.\n\nBusiness doubles. People want corn tarts now and lemon with thyme like a dare they think they can win. Ro raises prices a dollar on anything that involves butter because the world is the world, and apologizes with an extra cookie you didn\u2019t order. She starts a Saturday morning class she calls \u201cI Will Not Let You Burn Sugar\u201d and fourteen strangers show up with their hair tied back and their eyebrows threaded with skepticism and leave with jars of amber they hold like newborns. She teaches them to kinesthetically know hard crack from soft ball and says, \u201cYou\u2019ll hear the change in pitch,\u201d and they believe her and then they hear it and they shout like children at a parade. She begins to believe in the usefulness of being watched when you are doing something well.\n\nHer inbox is a forest. Brands ask her to hold things next to her face and smile. A cooking magazine wants to fly her to a city she has never loved and wants her to pretend it is her favorite place and to say a line about butter that someone else wrote. A publisher wants to know if she has feelings about writing a thing between two covers that will sit in kitchens and sop up soup. The judge writes once, briefly, on paper as if paper were harder to fake. It is a note about aprons and hooks and a joke that is not for anyone but them, which does something to Ro\u2019s sternum that feels like being handed a very small glass animal and asked not to break it. She writes back on notebook paper with rounded corners and tells her about a mug and a raccoon and an alley galaxy. She signs it with her name and a P.S. that says If you put thyme in the biscuits, I will, too. There is a world in which this is nothing; Ro is living in the parallel world where it is a month of good weather.\n\nOne afternoon, three weeks into being a person the internet remembers, a car with New York plates parks crooked outside the diner and Celeste walks in with a box and sunglasses the size of confidence. She has a haircut even sharper than before and a jacket that costs an apology. Bloomington looks at her with the polite curiosity of people who will google later and pretend they did not. Celeste puts the box on the counter, slides onto a stool, and orders coffee like she invented java and is bored of her own invention. She looks at the apron on its hook and says, \u201cBlue suits you,\u201d without malice, which makes the compliment mean something, and ducks when Hank brandishes a spray bottle and declares, \u201cNew York! We do not allow fancy here unless it tips,\u201d because he cannot help himself.\n\nThey play Scrabble in the late afternoon after the lunch rush has deflated like a pie with too many aspirations. Celeste places words like knives, and Ro counters with agricultural terms and a frankly vulgar anagram that makes Celeste laugh so hard she almost tips her chair. They split the series and call it a draw. Then Celeste opens the box and pulls out four pastries she has named after verbs and makes them sit next to one another like sisters, and Ro brings out a corn tart that is not the final one but is its cousin, and they trade without commentary. They eat like people who understand that criticism is love in disguise and say true things with tiny bites and the occasional hand to chest because a crumb did the right thing. It is as sweet and dangerous as any of the editing choices a producer can make.\n\nWhen evening lays itself down on the town, Celeste stands on the sidewalk and squints up at the maple as if it will reveal narrative. \u201cI thought I would come to yell and leave,\u201d she says, as if that would surprise anyone. \u201cBut your shampoo smells like rosemary and your brother is absurd and your town treats me like a benign weather event, and now I have to go home and admit human feelings to my therapist. I hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am, inconveniently,\u201d Ro says. \u201cStay for pancakes tomorrow and let my mother tell you about the emergency cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will steal your emergency cake recipe and rebrand it,\u201d Celeste replies. She touches Ro\u2019s shoulder as if to bless, as if to anchor, as if unsure which category of touch this belongs to. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a pop-up,\u201d she says, suddenly all business again, because that is her chariot. \u201cMy place in November. Corn and bitterness. Maple and restraint. Pistachio and apology. It will be a theme.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring whales,\u201d Ro says, and Celeste\u2019s mouth shapes around the word whale like a person trying not to grin and failing.\n\nThe judge is a slower orbit, not because she is aloof, but because she is careful with the frequency of her gravity. They exchange envelopes like neighbors leaning over fences, with weather reports and recipes and an occasional ticket stub taped to a page with unreliable glue. When a charity event comes up in December, the email arrives with three sentences and a PS that makes Ro sit down and put her head on her arms. It reads, in its entirety: We do a bake for the hospice every year. It is small, important, and I am shameless. Will you come. We will not film it. The PS says: You will freeze. Bring the blue apron as an extra layer; it looks warm.\n\nThe day she buys the ticket for London in her own browser, without a production company behind it, she thinks for a long time about the way choices now braid with last year\u2019s accidents. There is always the question of who owes whom when it comes to joy. She decides, in the end, that there are debts you pay with showing up. She sends a photo of her confirmation to Mina with a caption that reads field trip, and Mina replies with an image of herself in three scarves and a note that says I am coming in your pocket as a heating pad. Her mother texts the lemon biscuit recipe with the thyme addendum circled in red and an arrow that reads put this in your suitcase.\n\nBetween now and then, there are weeks where it is enough to be Ro from the diner. She burns one tray of biscotti and does not take it as an omen. She figures out how to say no to a sponsored post about canned frosting with a diplomacy that makes Harriet raise an eyebrow in admiration. She sits on her porch with her feet on the swing and watches the maple change its mind slowly and then all at once. She makes a list titled winter armor and includes under it mittens, courage, cash for cab because lungs, lemon biscuits, enough sleep, and lets Mina add glitter and Celeste add red lipstick and Her Own Name underlined twice. The world gets colder at its edges and sweeter at its middle, as if dessert is the defense against the long dark. She writes herself a note and tucks it into the pocket of the blue apron for later: If you forget, ask the dough. It remembers you. It will again.",
