     "novel_text": "The first morning I saw her I was late, which was already a sign that my day would lean sideways. Bells from the cathedral came down the hill and folded over the roofs; they always do that in St Albans, as if time is a soft thing that can be laid gently on brick and slate. I left my house on Clarence Road with my scarf half-knotted and my casefile under my arm. The rain had decided to be thin and indecisive, like an argument you could walk away from without saying anything that couldn\u2019t be unsaid.\n\nNumber 12 had been empty for two months. The landlord had come and gone in a white van that smelled faintly, somehow, of turpentine whenever he left the door open. And now there were boxes stacked like pale teeth behind the thin curtains, and the front garden\u2014which could have been handsome, if anyone tried\u2014was newly raked. There she was, kneeling at the step with a hammer in one hand, coaxing the letterbox back to its hinges. I slowed down before I knew I was slowing down.\n\nShe had tied her hair up with a faded scarf, the kind with little stars picked into the weave. It made the dark of her hair look deliberate, arranged. Not pretty exactly, that\u2019s too small a word, but assembled in such a way you could believe the world had stopped for a second to get a better look. Her coat was paint-splattered, a green that had been green for some time and then had allowed itself to become a paler thing.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said without looking up, and the hammer skipped once on the brass. \u201cDo you live next door?\u201d\n\nI suppose I nodded, or said yes, or smiled. Something adequate must have happened between us because she held out two envelopes with the corner of one thumb and said, \u201cPostman is an anarchist. These say ten but may as well have been in my shoe.\u201d\n\nI took them. I do not remember the texture of the paper. This annoys me. I am a lawyer. I notice things. I\u2019m supposed to.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the street,\u201d I said, which was the polite thing. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet. Except Saturdays. And sometimes Thursdays. There\u2019s a trumpet player somewhere who has discovered Thursdays.\u201d\n\nShe smiled, and one side of her mouth decided to go higher than the other, as if the whole of her face was rehearsing asymmetries. \u201cIris,\u201d she said.\n\nHer name fell into me like a coin into a fountain, unsettling the water under the water.\n\n\u201cBret,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2014 I\u2019m on my way to court.\u201d I waved the casefile as if it were a passport.\n\n\u201cTo put the trumpet player in prison?\u201d\n\n\u201cSadly the law is ambiguous on brass.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with the hand that wasn\u2019t holding the hammer. There was a dark smear on her thumb that could have been ink or could have been something else. I have replayed that tiny gesture more times than I\u2019d care to tell you, and in each replay the smear becomes something new.\n\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Iris said, tapping the letterbox gently, and I walked away.\n\nOn the train I stood because St Albans City at half past eight is a particular chaos, and the men who fold their newspapers into murderous little squares do not relish sharing. I rehearsed opening statements in my head, but my mind\u2014stupid, disloyal mind\u2014kept insisting on that scarf, those stars it borrowed, and the way her mouth made a decision by itself. I remembered suddenly that Saint Alban had sheltered a stranger and then put on his hood to be taken in the stranger\u2019s place. It is a story we tell tourists, and ourselves, to make our roads make sense.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Priya asked when I got to the office, because she always knows when my mind has gained a fever that my hands deny.\n\n\u201cI am making a list,\u201d I said, pulling off my coat. \u201cOf the crimes for which there ought to be swift and terrible justice. Trumpet playing is number one.\u201d\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. \u201cNumber two?\u201d\n\n\u201cBananas on toast. People who chew pens. People who borrow biros and then press down so hard you can feel the ghosts of their signatures on paper three.\u201d\n\n\u201cBret,\u201d she said, her voice making my name into a caution and an invitation. \u201cWhat\u2019s number four?\u201d\n\n\u201cMoving in next door with a hammer,\u201d I said, and immediately wished I hadn\u2019t, because Priya has a face that is all mirror. She catches you looking and gives you back to yourself in a cleaner frame.\n\nShe smiled. \u201cGlad to see the diligent people of Clarence Road continue to perform emergency repairs between raindrops.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014 it\u2019s nothing,\u201d I said. Stupidity number one of the day: saying something is nothing. Of course it was something. Even when it is nothing, it is something. We spend our lives in the porous between.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Priya said, and pressed a mug into my hand that had the law\u2019s scales on it, one chipped slightly at the bottom, making the scales tilt. \u201cBecause you\u2019re in chambers at ten, and Dawson is in a mood.\u201d\n\nDawson, senior partner at Foster & Vale, liked to think of himself as the last gentleman. He wore ties as if they had been invented for him. He had once told me, earnestly, that the law is a chorus and we are its voices. On bad days he told me that the law is a blade and we sharpen it on human behavior. He was in a mood. But that\u2019s later. THIS is earlier.\n\nThe morning court case was not glamorous. It rarely is, like most things that keep the world from tilting into ditch. Boundary disputes are a kind of silent warfare, and the war that day was two hedges wide. Mr. Pemberton had a chain-link fence and a righteous belief in his tape measure. Mrs. Elliot had a rosebush that had been there longer than her children, and not much patience left for the precise placement of pegs. I spoke, then Priya spoke, then a man with a checkered tie spoke. We introduced photographs that were mostly hedge. The judge was exquisitely bored, an art form in itself.\n\nI watched how the participants positioned themselves. Crossed arms. Thumbs hidden, thumbs visible. Eyes sliding to the door. And I thought of letterboxes being reattached, and the small sound a hammer makes when it has nearly figured out how to be useful again.\n\nAt lunch I walked down to the cathedral because I do that sometimes. There is a coolness under the stones that exists even in October, a long, old calm like a reliable friend. The martyrs, cut into panels, look down with their preset expressions, and my footsteps in that nave are always unplaceable; I hear myself coming. There is a glass window that looks like falling. There is a carved capital where regular leaves curl around a face that looks surprised to be found. A child ran through the chairs and laughed. I wanted to tell him to keep that laugh clean, that one day he would need it; I wanted to say, Don\u2019t let them parcel your laugh into documents and disclaimers.\n\nIt took me a week to ask, after that first morning, and even then it wasn\u2019t asking. It was rain. Rain has manners in this city; it makes decisions gently. The pavement shone without entirely committing to being wet. The sky hung at a reasonable height. On my step there was a parcel in beige paper that might as well have belonged to the century before ours. It had my name without my title, as if I were not an adult yet, only a person between brackets. The return address was a shop on Holywell Hill I didn\u2019t know. It contained three pale candles and a note that said, simply, \u201cFor a time that decides to behave.\u201d There was no name.\n\nSo I knocked on Iris\u2019s door because who else would know what to do with time. It took longer than I expected for her to open, and by the time she did, in bare feet and with one eyebrow arched, I had run through an impressive array of excuses in my head: I was the local parcel redistribution hub; I was a candle inspector; I was newly religious.\n\n\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d I asked, holding out the candles as if they might explode.\n\n\u201cHello again to you too,\u201d she said, and stepped back so I could see the hallway behind her. It was in demobilized boxes, those slim cardboard coffins that keep histories in polite heaps. \u201cCome in.\u201d\n\nThe air inside number 12 smelled like dust that has learned a new purpose. It smelled like the gentle surrender of wood. A plant waited on a windowsill the way a question waits in a room.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve bought three things and borrowed twenty,\u201d Iris said, taking the candles and standing them on an empty mantel as if arranging chess pieces. \u201cDo you drink tea, or are you one of those men who drink gin when the light hits the first brick?\u201d\n\n\u201cI drink tea,\u201d I said. \u201cOften as revenge.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, and I noticed there were charcoal lines on the back of her hand, faint rings tracing up towards the wrist as if she had tried on bracelets and then forgotten to wash them off. She followed my gaze and rubbed at them absentmindedly, which made them smudge and soften. \u201cWork,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI paint mostly. And some days I decide to stop painting and do something else and then I pretend that is my life now. It doesn\u2019t always work. A while I did sound. Not music.\u201d She tilted her head, listening to a nearby siren that stitched the air through Hatfield Road. \u201cSound like you listen to the shape of a room and then you make it different.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shape of a room is important,\u201d I said. \u201cI am suddenly alert to the shape of rooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, Bret-not-a-title,\u201d she said, looking at the note I had brought in with the candles. \u201cWould you like a ridiculous biscuit? I have the ones that pretend to be digestives but are actually sugar.\u201d\n\nI took a biscuit mostly because it would be impolite not to, and partly because there is a kind of hunger that\u2019s not about food at all, and sometimes you have to give it something to hold in its fist.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your work?\u201d she asked, sitting on the floor like a person who prefers the first level of things. There was a micro-scar at the corner of her thumb that shone. The room rustled like a coat dropped on a chair.\n\n\u201cLaw,\u201d I said, and her face made that tiny adjustment people\u2019s faces make. \u201cI know. It is not like the shows. The parts that are like the shows are the parts you should worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t watch the shows,\u201d she said. \u201cI listen to people argue in supermarkets and decide who would win in case law. It\u2019s more fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI represent hedges,\u201d I said, and told her about Mr. Pemberton and Mrs. Elliot in a voice that made it sound nicer than it was. She laughed when she should. Then she told me about painting the river near Verulamium Park too fast, how she had to let the geese be smears because that day they refused to behave like geese. Her voice had a way of patting its children, a contained tenderness that did not spill unless she allowed it.\n\n\u201cThank you for the candles,\u201d I said when I remembered the manners I had put in my pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll save them for when time goes crooked.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo,\u201d she said. \u201cI think time is like a poorly trained dog. It needs to be told what to fetch.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it know how to drop it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you trade it for something good. A walk. An apple. A confession.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you collect confessions?\u201d I asked, and she smiled like someone who has been asked the right question by accident. She did not answer me then, but moved to the window and wiped a circle on the glass with the cuff of her sleeve.\n\n\u201cYou can see the cathedral from here in winter,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the trees get shy. I like it. The way the city can\u2019t help looking at itself.\u201d\n\nWe stood like that for a minute, my mug cooling, her sock a little damp where she had stepped into a quick puddle on the kitchen tile. The doorbell startled us both. She went and came back with a small package carefully wrapped in brown paper and string, like something that arrived by mistake from a different story about a different century. She didn\u2019t open it immediately, and I wanted to ask her what it was, as if that would be a normal thing for a neighbor to do.\n\n\u201cI should let you get back to your life,\u201d I said, because you are supposed to leave before the welcome\u2019s elastic snaps.\n\nShe walked me to the door and, in that small space between hallway and weather, she looked as if she would say something that would scoop me a little closer, but then didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter that there were small things. The rain went away and returned as if it had forgotten its keys. My mother phoned me on Sundays and asked me if I was eating, which is a code mothers use to ask if you are lonely. Kit at work, who has a face like bread\u2014plain and good and necessary\u2014brought in a Tupperware of something he called lasagna but which had not so much layered as tumbled. Priya won a small case against a large man and smiled in a way that made you believe in justice again for a few hours. I bought a new pen and wrote my name with it too many times on a spare sheet because the first mark of ink is a ceremony if you let it be.\n\nSometimes, coming home, I would hear Iris singing behind her door, but never the whole of a song; only the part that understood what it was for. Sometimes an older woman came to see her, carrying a shopping bag full of lemons and herbs. They would talk on the step for a while and then one of them would laugh quietly, and the other would correct that laugh gently, as if not wanting to wake anyone. I never learned her name.\n\nWhen the weather grew cooler she hung three small canvases on the wall opposite her couch and then decided she didn\u2019t like them and turned them to face the plaster. This made the room look like it was being punished, and I had to resist an impulse to knock again and ask the paintings what they had done.\n\nI bring you these things not to pad the tale but because if you don\u2019t have the small things, you don\u2019t have the big thing either. I have learned this both by watching the law work and by watching it not.\n\nWe built a conversation across our shared fence, in increments. She would lean over to pull a weed out from between the paving stones and say, \u201cIs this a weed?\u201d And I would say, \u201cEverything is a weed if you give it a different name.\u201d I\u2019d bring in the bin and she would stand on her step and ask, \u201cDoes the bin always do that? Sulk?\u201d We spoke about the fox who lived under the car on the corner and how he looked like a gentleman who had decided to be wild. We spoke about the crows and how they patrolled the streets as if we were the guests. Sometimes we didn\u2019t speak; we stretched silence between us like a clean sheet and let the air straighten it.\n\nOnce, I was balancing a bag of potatoes and a disaster of oranges in my arms and the bottom of the bag parted company with the rest of the bag on my path. The oranges rolled, a jail break. Iris stepped out and caught two with the kind of reflex that makes you think of goalkeepers and doctors.\n\n\u201cGravity likes me,\u201d she said, handing them back. \u201cOr hates me. We\u2019re in a long-distance relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, bending and scooping and laughing more than the moment deserved, because laughter is a solvent and I needed something to pour over the day. She handed me the last orange and that was when I saw the inside of her wrist carefully inked with a pencil line, very fine, that traced from the base of her palm to the thin bones like a road on a map. She saw me see it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for later,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI draw them first to see if they belong. Sometimes they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cA sketch for a\u2014\u201d I said, and stopped because I did not want to be the kind of man who names things that are not his.\n\n\u201cFor a thing,\u201d she said, and turned her hand so the rain could erase it more quickly.\n\n\u201cDo you\u2014 do you have many?\u201d I ask her, and immediately felt foolish because my skin was a landscape of precisely nothing, save a scar from a bicycle accident when I was nine and a faint ghost of a bee sting I still insist I remember.\n\n\u201cSome,\u201d she said. \u201cMostly hidden. It feels... like carrying a story on the outside for once.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds right,\u201d I said, because it did. The law is a way of carrying a story on the outside of your head until someone agrees with you.\n\nWe met in the grocery on Victoria Street and pretended to be surprised. We met on the Alban Way and pretended not to be winded. We met under the same awning during a sudden, clean rain that lasted exactly three minutes, and we did not pretend anything. We shared the weather like a secret.\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel,\u201d she said one Thursday when the trumpet player was briefly merciful, \u201clike your name is a coat someone else bought for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly all the time,\u201d I said.\n\nShe twitched her mouth in that one-sided way. \u201cMy mother wanted to call me Iris because she liked the idea of seeing,\u201d she said. \u201cMy father told her she liked the idea of drinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe did both,\u201d Iris said, and then laughed in a way that said this wasn\u2019t a joke but we were allowed to place it in the shelf where jokes live.\n\nWe told each other our small facts. I told her how my father taught me to fix a leaky tap in a kitchen that is no longer a kitchen and how the sound of a slow drip can still hijack my whole chest. She told me about a job she had in a shop that sold only lights, and the day the lights all went out in a storm, and how customers came in anyway to stand among the dark lamps as if they were in a forest that had decided to sit down. I told her how, when I was nine, my schoolteacher Mrs. Marchant sent home a note I kept folded in a book for years, about how neat my handwriting was. She told me how she once gave a man a painting in exchange for a winter coat and never regretted that currency.\n\n\u201cDoes the law move you?\u201d she asked me one evening when the sky folded itself into a deeper blue and stayed, like a curtain that had learned manners.\n\n\u201cNot as much as the people inside it do,\u201d I said, and meant several things at once. I am always meaning several things at once. It is a curse of people who have learned to speak through drafts.\n\n\u201cThe river moved me today,\u201d she said from her step. \u201cIt decided to be metal in the morning and cloth by afternoon. I would like to be as unapologetic as a river when I grow up.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d\n\nThat week I kept noticing marks. On bus shelters. On people\u2019s arms. On the side of the fishmonger\u2019s van where someone had written love with one of the letters scratched out so you had to complete it with your mind. On the floor at court where tape marks drew borders for chairs that could not remember where to stand. The city seemed to be labeling itself for me, and I wasn\u2019t sure whether to be comforted or suspected. Every phone call, every file, I wanted to write a small note in the margin and say, Look here, a sign. Look here, a thing that means more than it means.\n\nIt was almost November when Priya asked me to come to a gallery on a back street near the Clock Tower where someone she knew had hung photographs of windows. \u201cYou\u2019ll hate it,\u201d she said happily. \u201cBut in a way you\u2019ll enjoy hating it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a neighbor,\u201d I said, because we do this, we introduce new people into our old sentences.\n\n\u201cYou do,\u201d she said, with interest but not surprise. \u201cDo you like this neighbor?\u201d\n\nI sifted through shapes of words, like coins in the pocket of someone else\u2019s trousers. \u201cI like how she makes me notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cDangerous,\u201d Priya said. \u201cNoticing leads to action. Or terrible poetry.\u201d\n\nWe went anyway, and my suit felt wrong among all that art. The photographs were what she had said they would be: windows, neat in a grid, each with a slight variation, a plant or a curtain or a face you could not be sure you really saw. I stood there and did my duty of standing and thinking empathetic thoughts about detail. Iris arrived ten minutes in. She had changed her scarf; this one had little white birds along the edge that looked like commas that had learned to fly. She kissed me on the cheek like we had been doing it for years. \u201cYou hate it?\u201d she asked, and I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nWe walked out and down past a pub that was never sure what it was called and a charity shop that had more chairs than anyone could reasonably need. We went into a coffee place where the staff had names like Arlo and Kit and Thea, and they used mint in ways that made me distrust mint. We sat. She drew at the edge of a paper napkin, small arcs that intersected and then turned into something else. She did not notice she was doing it. The ink stained her index finger like a small surrender.\n\n\u201cTell me what case you\u2019re carrying in your pocket like a stone,\u201d she said, because by then she had learned me.\n\n\u201cA girl,\u201d I said. \u201cYoung. Sixteen. She took her mother\u2019s car and went to Southend and then didn\u2019t go back home exactly, and now everyone is trying to decide if she has done something wrong or just done something.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has done something,\u201d I said. \u201cThings are not always a crime when adults feel hurt. But we\u2019re good at labelling them that way, because it\u2019s easier to make a person a file than to make them a situation.\u201d\n\nIris looked at me with a seriousness that held my face still. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a situation?\u201d she asked, and all the ordinary noise of the coffee shop bled into a single held note.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, because lying is a talent of mine that I decided not to use right then. \u201cBut I mean that as a compliment. A situation means there is time involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like time,\u201d she said, and then, without seeming to move at all, her hand was on my wrist, light, like the way a moth would be if a moth had decided to be gentle. She smiled and then didn\u2019t.\n\nI walked home that evening and the leaves had turned the color of tea when you forget the bag. I wanted to run, not because anything was chasing me, but because sometimes your bones want to arrive before your skin does. Iris was not home. A note on her door said, Back in an hour, with a drawing of a small fish in the corner, smiling like someone who knows better than to smile.\n\nI put the kettle on. I sat at my table, which is not really mine, which belonged to my father for a long time and has the marks to prove it, and then belonged to a man called Tom who went to Spain with someone he met on the train, and was given to me as a kindness. I took out a sheet of paper and wrote, Dear Iris, and then stopped, because where do you put the rest of the sentence. I leaned my head against the cool glass of my back door and watched the fox take his route between compost bins like a commuter with better posture.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell when I decided to love her. That\u2019s not false modesty. Some decisions are a clean click. Others are a vandalism of will, unreadable until afterwards. It might have been when I first saw her with the hammer, making repairs to her world in the rain, because I have always liked people who make repairs. It might have been in the coffee shop, when her hand held me like a promise she didn\u2019t have to redeem. It might have been when she told me about the winter coat, and navigated generosity with a map that felt known to my bones. It might have been the evening she stood in her doorway and said, \u201cDo you wish the law was sometimes a person so you could forgive it?\u201d and I laughed then because I wanted to kiss her.\n\nIn the morning I woke early and walked down to Verulamium Park. The water made that practicing-violins sound it makes when it tries to get your name right. Children in small uniforms marched in pairs. A woman threw bread at a loaf of ducks who had no intention of being polite about it. I thought about the fact that some of my happiest moments in recent months had happened within ten meters of a fence.\n\nWhen I came back she was on her step, sitting cross-legged with a small mirror propped inside the door. She held a black pen\u2014the kind with a precise, aggressive nib\u2014and drew a line along the outer edge of her forearm, slow, like someone putting a road where there had never been one. She did not look up when I approached, and this seemed to me, absurdly, like a kind of trust. At the edge of the line she paused and glanced over, and the glance did everything a conversation attempts in paragraphs.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you ever feel like drawing on yourself to know where you are?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d I said, and then caught myself and turned that admission into a shrug. \u201cI write on case files instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cUseful,\u201d she said, returning to the mirror, and I stood there for a moment, feeling my life press its face to the window and exhale.\n\nYou will think I forget other people existed, but I assure you they still did. The firm continued to be exactly itself. Dawson came into a meeting with a coat that knew it was expensive and a manner that had tested well in focus groups. He asked me to draft a letter to a client whose money had gone missing the way sometimes money takes a walk on a hot day. Priya told me she had dreamed of her grandmother folding sheets in an endless hotel that had no rooms. The trumpet played on Thursday like a small civil war and the crows voted with their wings to side with whoever paid attention.\n\nIt was late Friday when Iris knocked on my door for the first time. I had been halfway through a proper dinner and twenty-eight percent of the way through a sad one. I opened to find her with rain on her curls and a look like a petition.\n\n\u201cElectricity died,\u201d she said. \u201cIt tried for a while to be both off and on and then decided to commit. I\u2019m not frightened,\u201d she added quickly, and then rolled her eyes at herself \\\u2014 as if the word frightened was a dress that did not fit. \u201cBut it will be a while and my room looks like a shrug. Could I exist near you for a while?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, which was easier to say than the other thing I was considering saying, which was Stay, but no one belongs to anyone and I am trying to be good at that. I made tea with the ceremony I make tea with when someone watches me. Iris sat at my table and curled the sleeve of her coin-colored jumper over her hands, and I found I was talking for both of us, because sometimes you have to pour words into the room so it doesn\u2019t feel like the roof will come down. I told her about the first case I lost, and how I went home and ironed my shirts like I was punishing cotton. She told me about a dog she once found in Wales, temporary and soft, who followed her for a day and then made its own decision about belonging.\n\nWhen it was time for her to go, she stood in my hall and we looked at our shoes like traitors. I saw, briefly, a pattern on her collarbone, ink or shadow or imagination, a geometry that implied decision. She saw me see, and the room leaned a bit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m marking again,\u201d she said, almost apologetically. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll keep it. There\u2019s a shop down near London Road I go to sometimes, to ask questions. Perpetual Ink. Terrible name.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerpetual,\u201d I said, as if trying the word for weather. \u201cWhere does the name stop being a promise and become a threat?\u201d\n\nShe smiled in the way that meant she liked the question. \u201cI suppose we all decide that line at different times,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing the world is mostly indecisive.\u201d\n\nWe said goodnight in the manner of people who have practiced alone and now find real circumstances harder. I closed my door and leaned my head against it and laughed softly like someone who has just tasted something they did not know they had been hungry for.\n\nBy then I had begun to keep a little notebook, a cheap one you can buy at the station. I told myself it was for work and then we both knew it was not. I wrote down groundless things that felt like ground. The time the bells rang not at the hour but some strange time in between and I swore the birds shifted by an invisible command. The way Mrs. Pell, who runs the shop at the corner, says my name like a question and then immediately answers it herself. The way my own name looks when written quickly, how the letters lean towards each other like conspirators. Iris\u2019s lines on her skin. Iris\u2019s hand holding a spoon. Iris\u2019s anger when the man on the bus callously folded his newspaper and hit a woman\u2019s shoulder with it and did not apologize. I had not known anger could look beautiful and I do not know if I approve of that.\n\nYou will ask me what I wanted. We are always asking ourselves that quietly in the backs of rooms while someone tells a story and arrives at the part where the wanting is the point. I wanted what I always want: to move across a room without the room changing itself to suit or to punish me. To sit with a person without parts of me turning their faces to the wall because they do not wish to be seen. To be looked at by a person who knows where my edges are and does not try to move them with their hands. To drink tea that does not cool quickly. To sleep without the night asking me for identification. To read a book and not disassemble it while I\u2019m reading it, because not everything is work. To have the law in the room but sitting softly on the floor, not in my lap.\n\nIn December the market put up its lights and the stalls sold cinnamon and somehow that smell became the air for three weeks. I bought Iris a book because I am dull that way, but the book was illustrations of medieval animals that have never existed, and I wrote in the front: For when you need a creature that cannot be categorized. She opened it and ran her finger over a drawing of a hare with antlers, and then shut it quickly as if she were worried the hare would leave.\n\n\u201cFor you,\u201d she said, and handed me a fountain pen in a soft, severe case. \u201cI watched a video of a man in Japan making it and I knew you would be unbearable with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said, and then, in an act of uncharacteristic bravery, I took the lid off and wrote her name on the top page of my notebook so deliberately that my hand trembled.\n\nWe stood on the pavement, two people with small, expensive objects, snow plotting quietly above us without following through. I wanted to kiss the corner of her mouth, where decisions seemed to be made. I wanted to do it in front of the whole of Clarence Road and the fox and Mrs. Pell and the trumpet player. I did not. I do not know if that was courage or cowardice. The line between wind and weather is an argument the sky gets to win.\n\nThere was a night, late, when I woke from a dream where my father was teaching me again how to fix a leak and I was breaking everything I touched. The house made the night noises it keeps in a cupboard. I went to the window and saw a light on in Iris\u2019s front room, a warm hold of light, and a moving shape, her. She was pacing, not in distress exactly, but like someone measuring the room to find its heart. She raised her arms and let them fall, repeated it three times, then stood very still. I stood at my pane of glass like a child at a museum, and then felt ashamed of the tiny distance. I made tea I didn\u2019t drink and considered sending her a message I didn\u2019t send. There is a way to love that feels like you are keeping watch, and a way to love that feels like you are standing guard against yourself.\n\nThe next day she knocked and said, \u201cI need a witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have only the law,\u201d I said, trying to make a joke as a shield.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a show. Small. Here. In the house. People in rooms looking at things on walls and pretending the rooms don\u2019t matter. You\u2019ll pretend with them. But I need you to look before they do, so the walls know they are going to be looked at.\u201d\n\nI nodded. I did not understand the job but I was ready to be asked. She moved through her rooms with the careful decisiveness of a sculptor of air. The canvases were new to me, and not. A river that refused to be only water; a forest that you could feel breathing. A window the exact blue the evening decides to be when it is not yet ready for black. A body\u2014hers?\u2014only partial, a collarbone that made me want to forgive everything. She watched me watch them. My watching did a thing to her face I could not have anticipated: it loosened something that had been clamped for years. I said very little. For once, this seemed the correct call.\n\nThe night of the show the street brought its eyes and its coats. The trumpet player was invited and did not play, which felt like a small miracle we were not worthy of. Priya came, with a green scarf that made even her sarcasm seem benevolent. Dawson came and looked at everything with duty and left with relief. People murmured the way they do when they\u2019re translating their feelings into words they hope will be fashionable later. And Iris stood still and did not defend herself. She did not explain. In that room the law was, for a few hours, a small nice dog asleep on the rug.\n\nAfter they left we sat on the floor and ate toast and she put her head on my knee very briefly and then immediately apologized for the entire concept of knees. I put my hand very near her hair and then remembered to move my hand and did. She laughed in her throat and did a small shiver.\n\n\u201cIf I ever disappear, will you have to come find me?\u201d she asked, watching the last of the guests negotiate themselves out the front door.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt will be tedious for both of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI intend to carry a map on my skin,\u201d she said, and then sat up. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about doing a bigger one. Not a flower, not something with names. Something that will make me remember a time I need to remember. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know if it will scare the people who get scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cScaring the right people is a hobby you could list on forms,\u201d I said. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t scare yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said, and then made a face, because we had both caught the lie mid-jump. \u201cAll right. I do. But I still want it.\u201d\n\nShe looked at my face the way the city looks at the cathedral when the trees go shy. \u201cWould you come with me? When I go. Just to walk me there. Just so that when I step out again there is a person who remembers the before.\u201d\n\nI agreed, without understanding that we were going somewhere I would no longer be able to follow. I said yes because my mouth has learned to say yes faster than my nervous system can catch it and negotiate.\n\nYou will want, later, to measure the distance between this moment and another, much sharper one, with a ruler. You will want steps to count. But there is a point at which counting is not the equal of knowing. You put your hand on a door. You open it. The room beyond is always larger than the hinges imply. And even here, even right now, when I tell you that I loved a way to exit and a way to return, I know you will look at me and say that love is a name only, a coat you put on because they gave it to you.\n\nI am putting on the coat.\n\nI am walking out of my house into the kind of January light that pretends to be polite. Iris is on her step with her hands in her pockets, making her shoulders small, and she gives me that look I associate with buses that are just about to arrive. We walk down Holywell Hill, past the window where the hare with antlers looks out, past the shop that sells bulbs caged in delicate wire like little moons they might keep, past a woman with a pink hat who says sorry and does not look sorry. The city bends itself around us.\n\n\u201cAre you frightened?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cI am hospitable,\u201d she says. \u201cI am making tea for the fear in my chest and asking it to sit properly while we discuss terms.\u201d\n\nPerpetual Ink, terrible name, is painted black in a way that suggests an argument with color. There are prints on the walls, and a man with long fingers and eyes that look two seconds ahead greets us and says Iris like a secret. She hands him a drawing I have only seen as a blur when she slid it into her pocket by my front door. He nods like a person who has agreed in advance to very little and now finds himself agreeing to more. \u201cYou sure?\u201d he asks. \u201cBecause this is a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Iris says.\n\nI wait in the outer room among the magazines that all smell like they were left in the same sun. A woman is talking to her friend about how she hopes her mother will understand. A boy with a scar that makes his eyebrow look impatient is pretending not to be frightened. I pick up a magazine about ink like it is a book about travel and I am going to a country I will not be good at. The music is patient and bass-heavy; it sits in the bones more than the air. Iris disappears behind the curtain.\n\nThree minutes later she reappears and makes a face that means I will be sitting there a while. I do. I think about letters. I think about Saint Alban and a hood. I think about the word permanent and want to argue with it. I write down in my notebook the color of the morning. I write down the exact pattern of the tiles under my feet. My mind tries to be a camera. My mind fails.\n\nAfter, when she comes out, when she is holding her arm like a person holds something they do not yet know how to name, she is not the same, and I do not mean the ink. She is like a room that has had its furniture quietly rearranged so that your path through it is new. She does not look at me at first. She looks at the window where the street is still hard and ordinary, where the buses still insist, where the woman in the pink hat walks past and is still not sorry.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask, stupidly, because my mouth asks what is in front of it.\n\n\u201cI made a decision,\u201d she says, and the way she says decision makes me wonder how many other decisions have sat in her chest like small, stubborn animals.\n\n\u201cCan I see?\u201d I ask, and she lets me.\n\nI look. I wish now I had not, which is not to say I blame the looking. Some images go into you clean and set up a room. Others arrive with their own weather. This one wasn\u2019t a flower or a map. It wasn\u2019t a word. It wasn\u2019t a bird taking off or an anchor deciding to give up. It was\u2014 I should not try to describe it and I will anyway, because what else is there to do. It was a shape I recognized from nowhere and everywhere, like a sickness a city gets in winter on all its windows. It ran up her forearm like a vine that had learned geometry, and at its center there was a negative space, an absence, that pulled the eye and held it. It was exquisitely done. It was beautiful. It was a mark that said: Now I have joined myself.\n\nI did not say any of that. I said nothing. I sat with my mouth closed while the ink dried and my pulse went into the wrong room. She covered it again, tucked her hand into her pocket, and we walked out together, and the air was the same and not. The sky decided to make weather after all, a little rain that did not ask permission.\n\nOn the walk home she told me about the buzzing in her bones and about how the man with the long fingers had said, You\u2019ll need to sit with it, like it was a guest she would have to entertain for a while. I nodded and made small noises of agreement. Inside, something was taking inventory. I cannot tell you why my body voted no on a thing that made her say yes; the reasons we give ourselves later are not the reasons at the time. But my blood had a meeting. My skin tried to move away from itself. I thought absurdly of my neat handwriting in Mrs. Marchant\u2019s class, of how pleased she was, and felt the sharp and ridiculous grief of someone who misses a teacher who taught him to not make a mess.\n\nWe reached our doors. She turned to me and showed me the corner of it again as if to say, This is the story, and I must love it now for both of us. I smiled then, because I am an expert at smiling when the room expects it. I said, \u201cIt suits you,\u201d which is true and was a kindness and also a sentence that sits next to a different sentence I did not say, which is that it did not suit me at all.\n\nI went into my house and put the kettle on and did not make tea. I sat at the table with the pen she had given me and did not write. There are moments when you are pulled to the edge of your own patience with yourself and you think, either I will be someone else now, or I will have to pretend to be more of myself than is reasonable. It is not noble. It is barely tolerable.\n\nThat night I dreamed of a room with no corners and woke knowing exactly how many corners my room has. The fox screamed the way foxes do, which is a horror made animal, and somewhere a glass fell in someone\u2019s kitchen and did not break. I lay there and listened to the world perform its small theater, and thought: she has done a thing that will not be undone.\n\nIn the morning, as if to reassure myself, I ironed a shirt with such precision it felt violent. I walked to the office with the exact route I always take, counting steps at the parts where I know the cracks. I sat at my desk and put my pen on the paper and did not use it. Priya looked at me and then looked away tactfully; know this about her, she will always give you the privacy to fail. Dawson entered and asked if anyone had seen the file for Mr. Langley and I said, Absent, like I was taking attendance. Everything was the same and not.\n\nI did not see Iris that day. Or the next. I thought of her as a page turned and me as a reader who is not ready, and then corrected myself, because I am not allowed this dramatics. I walked home the long way once, detouring through the market and then the car park, which is to say I pretended to have a reason to be wholly elsewhere. My chest did an excellent imitation of carrying something heavy.\n\nWhen I saw her again, three days later, she was talking with Mrs. Pell on the pavement about a plant that had decided to die and I had the urge to ask the plant for help. I am a rational person. You would not know it now. She saw me, and waved, and that wave did a very specific thing to the inside of my mouth that made me feel I had been caught; she came nearer.\n\n\u201cYou look like someone,\u201d she said, \u201cwho has been in a room with a very smart child and a very broken kettle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kettle is obviously an allegory,\u201d I said, \u201cand the child is time.\u201d\n\nShe smiled and touched my sleeve with one finger, very gently, as if testing whether the cloth had made up its mind. \u201cCome over?\u201d she asked. \u201cI want to show you something, and I promise it isn\u2019t my arm again.\u201d\n\nI went. Of course I went. We are all, in the end, complicit in ourselves. The room was arranged differently, the paintings shifted to make room for a thing that wasn\u2019t there. On the couch was a stack of letters tied with string like something people do in films. She untied them and let them spill and one fell to the ground and I saw my name. Not my name. The name Bret in someone else\u2019s hand, written years ago, a pen pressing down too hard, the way we write when we are nervous or sixteen. She picked it up and pressed it into my hand.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I asked, and she put her hair behind her ear in the way I have told you before and I will tell you again and again because you must understand this in order to forgive me.\n\n\u201cA letter I wrote when I was a person who put all the words in the world in bad places,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to read it. I am not one of those people who makes other people read old maps. I only want you to know there was a map.\u201d\n\nI held the paper as if it would bite. I did not read it. I did not ask her to explain. I was gentle and normal and precise. We had tea and did not make the tea perform. We left the letters like a mess on the couch because sometimes you have to leave a mess to convince yourself you can be a person who owns things.\n\nLater that evening, the trumpet played and we could hear it through our walls at the exact same angle. Iris laughed and leaned her head back and when she did, the collar of her shirt slipped and I saw again the edge of the thing on her skin, and I felt a movement in me that you would be right to call fear, though at the time I dressed it more politely. It sat with me at my table later as if it had been invited. It went to bed and got into my side and waited. It is still here, sometimes, when the bells roll down the hill and the city tells itself a story about a man who put on someone else\u2019s hood and decided that meant something. I want it to mean something. I want everything to mean something. I want that to be allowed.\n\nThat night I took the three candles out of their paper and set them on my mantel. I lit one. It burned like it had been practicing. I sat in the chair that has a hollow where I always sit, and I watched the light do its slow work, and I put my hand out into it and then took it back. Outside, the fox made a sound like a hinge. The trumpet paused as if it had been told a secret. The candle burned down to the point where you could blow it out and leave the night to finish the sentence. I did not blow it out. I let it decide. I thought, not for the first time, that a person\u2019s life is a story they tell to the person they hope to be, and that the person who listens is always a liar. I thought, in the quiet, that I had been given an invitation. I thought, in the quiet that is never quiet enough, that I was not ready. I thought, and I thought, and the candle, polite and determined, did what it had always been made to do.The next morning the city put on a coat of frost that made the pavements a little theatrical. Breath hung in front of faces like trial balloons, and the light decided to behave the way light behaves when it has been given rules and is trying not to touch anything it shouldn\u2019t. I left my house early because sleep had been polite and brief; it had set me at the edge of the bed at five and said, Good luck with your day, and I had shook its hand and gone downstairs out of habit. The fox had not yet finished his rounds and looked at me as if to say we were both too eager. The candle I had allowed to complete itself had left a small crater of wax like the map of a country that used to exist. I tidied around it with a care that would have embarrassed me if anyone had been present, because it felt like tidying around a decision.\n\nAt the cathedral a man with a broom swept stone in wide arcs that made a sound like the beginning of rain. The nave was empty the way a room is empty when it is waiting to be good, which is different than the way it is empty after everyone has gone home. A notice near the door said Candlemas in a script that tried to be plain and almost was. I stood in the cool and said my secular prayers, which are mostly just names of people I hope continue to exist. In a side chapel a woman with a coat sensible enough to survive any age lit a thin candle and the flame made a small, competent vow. I did not light one. I did not feel worthy of adding to the arithmetic when I had candles at home that asked their own questions.\n\nOn my way back, Iris was standing in the small bay window like someone who had been arranged there by a considerate director. The aftermath of ink had made a slight discipline of the way she held her arm, a choreography that asked for space between fabric and skin. She saw me and waved with the other hand, and I did a complicated gesture with my scarf as if my scarf were a person with feelings. She opened her door before I was quite at mine, and the air between the two houses did a little contraction that my body noticed before my head did.\n\n\u201cHow is your guest?\u201d I asked, because that seemed safer than asking how she was, which is sometimes an ambush disguised as care.\n\n\u201cHe is quiet and imperious and would like to be introduced to everyone as soon as possible so he can make decisions,\u201d she said, smiling with only the middle of her mouth, and I saw the shine of the dressing under her sleeve and tried not to fall in love with the fact of care. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not fine. It\u2019s like the weather having an opinion about my arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d I said, and then immediately corrected, because this is my specialty, repairing sentences as they leave my mouth. \u201cNot good, but\u2026 you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d she said, and for a brief moment the most ordinary word we own sounded like a clean instrument.\n\nAt work, Priya looked at my face in the way a doctor looks at the color of a person\u2019s nails, and I made a noise that pretended to be the sound competent men make when they are asked to lift piano lids. She handed me coffee and a stack of files and said, \u201cYou\u2019re early, which means the world is either ending or beginning. We have Langley at eleven, and the girl\u2019s review has been moved to this afternoon if the magistrate\u2019s stomach can bear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe magistrate\u2019s stomach,\u201d I said, trying on a grin like a tie, \u201chas survived lunches that would have felled a younger man.\u201d\n\nShe tilted her head and did not pursue the joke, and I appreciated her silence the way you appreciate a well-timed hand on your shoulder that does not linger. The case files lay there in their elastic bands like sandwiches wrapped too tightly, and I imagined unwrapping them and finding different fillings than the ones the law allows. Mr. Langley\u2019s documents had that very specific smell of paper that has decided to be important and is only half right about it. The money that takes a walk on a hot day had not yet decided to come home, and Dawson had written in his neat slanted script the kind of sentence that suggests more is known than can be said aloud. It looked like the beginning of a short, unsatisfactory poem.\n\nAt eleven, Dawson went first because that is what he does, and the room rearranged itself around his voice as if it had practice. We discussed the numbers in ways numbers deserve to be discussed, which is to say clearly and with the possibility of being wrong. Dawson suggested phrasing in the letter to Mr. Langley that would make a person feel seen and misdirected at the same time, which is a talent I do not enjoy in other people but admire when the stakes are large. I kept looking at the corner of my own notepaper where I had written Iris\u2019s name in the pen she had given me and had almost written it too large. I pressed the edge of the nib into the paper until the impression showed on the desk through the sheet and then felt a ridiculous flare of shame, as if I had broken something that mattered to someone else. Dawson was describing an escrow that had changed shape when I thought, abruptly, that I did not know what shape I was, and then I remembered I had eaten half a banana in the kitchen and had not finished it, which is the kind of chaos my mind prefers when real chaos is present.\n\nAfter lunch, the girl sat on the bench with her hands clasped in that performance of innocence that teenagers do when innocence is a negotiation with theatre. She was smaller than the file implied. Her mother sat behind her with her mouth pursed into an emblem, and a man whose job it is to make options narrower than they start out being shifted papers as if he were preparing to perform surgery on a very stubborn organ. I spoke calmly because if you do not give people calm at these moments you give them nothing.\n\n\u201cShe went,\u201d I said to the room softly, \u201cto the edge of a place and measured herself against it. She was wrong to take property, but she was not wrong to take herself to a shoreline and see what the air does there. We make the mistake, often, of treating teenage navigation as crime when it is just navigation with poor signage.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate looked at me from behind a pair of glasses that have seen many navigations, and his mouth did a small thing, and I knew I had the room for a minute. The girl did not look at me, because to look at me would have been to accept an adult handand she was not ready to be seen by anyone who did not know her washing powder. I saw the mother\u2019s chin tremble and then stop, like a small animal that has decided against bolting. We got what we needed, which is to say a little more time and a little less punishment, and I carried that win like a pebble I placed carefully on a shelf.\n\nOn my way back to Clarence Road the air had decided to be kind about the cold. The woman with the pink hat was arguing with a man about whether the milk was off, and the argument had in it the entire skeleton of a marriage I did not want to think about. Outside the greengrocer, the older woman with the herbs stood with a bag of parsley that had not been given the choice but to be beautiful. She saw me and did that particular British thing where you do not greet someone until they are exactly within greeting distance, and then greet them as if greeting had been inevitable all along.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Bret,\u201d she said, making my name sound like something she would keep safe in a drawer because she had always collected useful things. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you weighing oranges like you\u2019re measuring truth. I\u2019m Mina. Sometimes I make Iris eat soup. It is work, but I am committed to my craft.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to anyone who can persuade someone to eat soup,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is the only honest food.\u201d\n\nShe smiled and handed me the parsley as if I had earned it. \u201cYou are a talker,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you have the look of someone practicing not talking. You know of her letters?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw them,\u201d I said, and then stopped because it sounded like a confession and she did not need my confessions unless she asked for them. \u201cShe showed me a stack. She said I did not have to read them.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe kept them,\u201d Mina said, looking not at me but at a point just past my shoulder like she was watching a future queue for bread. \u201cSometimes she writes ahead, and when she gets to the place she wrote about, she puts the letters down on the table and sees if the room is true to the map. She wrote to a man named Bret years ago. She liked the mouth shape of it. She\u2019s superstitious like that, but not the small superstitions that make you stupid. The useful ones. She writes to doors and knocks afterwards. It\u2019s a kind of magic that won\u2019t owe anyone interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid she post them?\u201d I asked, picturing envelopes like birds with nowhere to land.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mina said, in the tone people use when someone has asked whether a person went swimming in a river in winter. \u201cThat would be a curse, and she doesn\u2019t do curses. She writes and ties and keeps and then unties and lets the past air out and then ties again. It\u2019s how some of us don\u2019t drown. Don\u2019t make a face at me as if I have said the wrong thing, it isn\u2019t a tragedy unless you point at it until it performs.\u201d\n\nI did not know I had made a face. I thanked her for the parsley because manners are the last fence left to us in an untidy world. She touched my arm briefly, the way people do when they want to know if you are a temperature they understand, and then she was gone. I watched her go with the astonished affection I keep discovering I have for strangers who know more about me than I do.\n\nThat evening Iris knocked with a small jar in her hand and an expression that suggested the jar had been born difficult and she was being patient with it. \u201cOintment,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not be alarmed by how it smells like a decision made by a forest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am familiar with forests that make decisions,\u201d I said, stepping aside, and she wandered to my kitchen as if she had signed an agreement with my countertops and could therefore lean on them without guilt. \u201cMina gave me parsley. She said soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe believes soup can fix a country,\u201d Iris said. \u201cShe isn\u2019t wrong. She once improved a very bad marriage with carrots and patience. The marriage undid itself a year later, but everyone ate well.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to sit?\u201d I asked, because standing was a choreography we were both tiring of. \u201cDo you want tea?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want,\u201d she said, and then paused like a person locating a word they had left in another room. \u201cI want to ask you if you are angry at me for being a person.\u201d\n\nI wish I could tell you I said the correct thing immediately. There is a version of me who is very good at being good. He makes cameos and is then unavailable for long stretches. I put the kettle on and it made the complaint it makes when it has been asked to work before it is emotionally ready.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not angry,\u201d I said, which was true and cheap. \u201cI am\u2026 finding out that the parts of me that like to put things on shelves are not always friendly to the part of me that wants to live entirely in the middle of a room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made my skin an argument,\u201d she said, sitting at the table and touching the jar to the wood like a respectful knock. \u201cI did it because I was tired of not arguing. I can see that when I lift my sleeve now, I am making you look at a thing you did not subscribe to. I don\u2019t want you to look if looking hurts you, but I also cannot carry myself like a smuggled package. These two truths do not kiss easily.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like your sleeve,\u201d I said, and we both laughed at the idiocy of that sentence, and somehow the laugh did more good than anything else we might have tried. I made tea. I made it with my whole back, which is how I make tea when I want to appear like a domestic person the world can rely on. Iris watched me and her face softened the way faces do when they decide to forgive at least one thing in the room.\n\n\u201cDo you want to see something that is not my skin?\u201d she asked when we had both distracted ourselves with sips. \u201cI don\u2019t mean art, exactly, but it is a cousin.\u201d\n\nShe went back next door and said, \u201cTwo minutes,\u201d and then came back with a small square wooden box. It was the kind of box that belonged to people in nineteenth-century novels who keep hair and decisions in cedar. She set it on the table and opened it, and inside were small squares of color on paper, like paint had decided to complete itself into a deck. She laid them out, patient, each with a pencil line of date. The shades moved from honest greens to dishonest blues to reds that almost dared you to say the word red out loud. I put my hand near them, not on them, because sometimes touching is a violation even at the level of ink.\n\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d I asked, although the answer was also there, obvious, like a friend you have not met yet but have seen in a photograph.\n\n\u201cA day,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve painted every day for a year. Not pictures. Not subjects. Just the weather of it. I try to make a color that is the closest I can get to what the day was asking, and then I write down the date and the time I knew and I put it in the box. Sometimes I get the color wrong and it haunts me for a week. Sometimes I get it and the rightness makes me too proud and then I leave the lid off to teach myself humility. This one\u2014\u201d She tapped a pale, cold blue with a small coil of gray crouched inside. \u201cThis one is the day my sister called me after a long silence and told me about the house with no corners. I didn\u2019t know how to make that color, so I made the color of not knowing. This one\u2014\u201d She touched a warm, indecent gold. \u201cThis is the first time I sold something that did not feel like treachery. This one is the morning you told me about a hedge that wanted to be a country.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I get a color?\u201d I asked, lightly, and then closed my mouth because sometimes you ask for a thing and then you remember you don\u2019t know what it will mean to have it.\n\n\u201cYou do,\u201d she said, and she did not reach for a new square. She lifted the lid of the box and there, on the inside of it where the wood had darkened in the shape of keeping, she had painted a small, disciplined line of ink that was neither blue nor black but the exact color of the corner of my suit where the fabric catches morning. \u201cI gave it to the box,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause not everything wants to be on paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to kiss you,\u201d I said, and it was the first time I had let a sentence leave my mouth without a permit, and it crossed the air between us without looking for crossings.\n\nShe set the paint square down slowly and looked at me with every part of her face, which is a kindness people do not extend nearly enough. \u201cYou may,\u201d she said, and then, a heartbeat later, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nWe stepped toward each other like people who had been warned about a floor but had decided to trust their feet anyway. Her hand moved to my arm, below the place where her own skin was tender, and she said, quietly, \u201cI will not show you what I am not ready to show you, and you will not look for what I do not offer, and we will be two people in a room with a good map.\u201d Then she kissed me, and the room reorganized itself around the new geography, and nothing important was broken. My body did a very small flinch when her sleeve grazed my wrist near the place I know us both to be shy. She felt it and paused and rested her forehead against mine like a person leaning on a doorframe in a strange house, and then I made the deliberate choice to put my hands around the back of her neck where skin is less about decision and more about kindness, and I kissed her again and did not even notice what the trumpet was doing somewhere out there in the ongoing Thursday of the world.\n\nAfter, we sat with the box open between us and the tea cold because tea does not like to be ignored. Iris put the lid on, reverent, and did the jar ritual with her arm while we talked in the way you talk when you have just returned from somewhere you could not take pictures. She told me about the sound design job where she made a room in London feel like the bottom of a swimming pool and the CEO of a company cried because his mother had taught him to swim in water that smelled like pennies. I told her about Mr. Langley and the language people use when they cannot say stealing but cannot bear to say mistake. The evening slid into us without having to knock. When she left, she put her hand on the doorframe and said, \u201cTomorrow, come to the cathedral with me if you can. They will do a thing with candles and very old music and I would like to pretend with you that we are always this old and very young.\u201d\n\nIn the cathedral at Candlemas, the world was persuaded into being a different shape for an hour. The nave was dark in a way only old rooms are allowed to be dark; there is a contract somewhere that specifies this. People held small flames like birds learning to trust the hand. The choir did not try to be surprising, and their refusal was a kind of relief. We stood near a pillar carved by a person whose hands must have ached for days and watched light move across faces as if it were considering who to forgive. Iris\u2019s fingers were cool and dry, and when she took my hand later in the hymn that everyone pretended to know, I felt a precise gratitude that I have rarely felt without wanting to bargain for more. A child a few rows ahead tried to blow his candle out and his mother put her hand gently over his and said, Not yet, and the not yet landed on my tongue like a small medicine.\n\nIn the soft noise of coats and whispers afterwards, Iris tipped her head toward the Lady Chapel like someone indicating a caf\u00e9. We moved that way and she stopped just inside the threshold, a place where people leave flowers for their dead and prayers that do not have addresses. She looked at the altar and then at me.\n\n\u201cMy father hated these rooms,\u201d she said, not asking me to approve of him. \u201cHe said they made people sentimental and useless, and he said that like it was both one thing and two. He liked to fix engines the way some people like to fix sentences. He took me once to a service like this and stood the whole time like a person being inspected, and afterwards he said something that sounded like contempt but was really fear. He is frightened of things that ask him to put down his tools. He does not know what his hands are for when they are not full.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father loved a tap,\u201d I said, because sometimes you owe the room an offering, even if it is only a domestic one. \u201cWe would go to houses and he would show me that if you listen long enough you can hear where water is hiding. He would be very suspicious of your box of colors.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would be right to be,\u201d she said, and we smiled at two men who will never meet, and perhaps that is for the best. We walked out into the nearly-night and the bell did a quiet inside-my-throat sound, and at that exact moment a boy with a trumpet walked past us, a case under his arm, and we looked at each other like children who have just seen a mythical animal decide to be ordinary.\n\nWe followed him because our honesty is selective. He turned down a street I know like the seams of an old jacket and went into the square where people who do not wish to be found practice not being found. He took his trumpet out and did not do anything foolish like looking around to make sure he had an audience, and he began to play an unambitious scale that still found a way to argue with the air. We stood at the edge of a bench and did not sit and did not apologize for standing. After a while, he noticed us and lifted his chin in the international sign for Are you going to make this into a problem.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good on Thursdays,\u201d Iris said, the way you would address someone whose dog you have been admiring.\n\nHe shrugged and did the trumpet equivalent of a smile. \u201cI like the echo.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like making your neighbors hate you on purpose?\u201d I asked, because I am still, despite my efforts, a petty man sometimes.\n\n\u201cThey can come find me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives people something to do. It is better than them going home and committing small crimes with their phones. Anyway, I\u2019m not always playing. Only on the days that have edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday has edges,\u201d Iris said, and the boy nodded like a person who has decided she is not a threat and perhaps an ally. He put the trumpet down. \u201cDo you play for someone?\u201d she asked, and he looked at her in a quick, assessing way, and then his whole face changed like a room that has decided to open its curtains.\n\n\u201cMy sister,\u201d he said, eyes on the protective felt of his case. \u201cShe\u2019s in the hospital until she decides to stop pretending. She pretends she\u2019s fine and then her body argues with her. I go there and play on Thursdays because the nurse I like works then and lets me stand under the window in the stupid courtyard with the stupid bins. They won\u2019t let me closer because I am contagious because I am a person. I come here first, to warm up. The buildings here listen better than the hospital does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hear you sometimes,\u201d I said, which felt like a confession and a compliment. \u201cI was going to submit a petition to the council.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo,\u201d he said, grinning with relief I did not know I was capable of causing. \u201cPretend I am a menace. It makes me feel like I\u2019m not being ignored.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Iris said softly, and there was a shape of pride in her voice that had nothing to do with him and everything to do with a person deciding not to flinch. We left him to his scales and walked back on streets that had changed their names without telling anyone.\n\nIn the days after, my house learned a new rhythm that included the sound of Iris\u2019s knuckles against my door and my own reluctant bag of oranges telling me I was allowed to be clumsy sometimes. I went to Perpetual Ink alone once, because sometimes a person will go to the edge of a picture to see if the paint will chip. The man with the long fingers looked up, and his face did not move much, and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re fine,\u201d as if I had asked him to read my fortune. I looked at the prints on the wall and understood none of them and half all of them. There was a sketch pinned near the counter, of a shape like the one I had seen on Iris\u2019s arm, except it was not finished, and in the margin in a hand not quite disciplined enough for the job someone had written absence in a very particular shade of pencil. I did not ask, and he did not tell, and we had a perfect conversation.\n\nBack at the office, the Langley situation grew legs. Money has a habit of taking not only walks but also holidays, and we were now required to draft a letter that would be sent to a man who wore shirts that have their own budget, gently suggesting that the firm where he has always kept whatever he could not be bothered keeping track of had, for reasons temporary and technical, mislaid a sum that could be described as uncomfortable. Dawson asked me to write a sentence that would make guilt sound like weather. I wrote: \u201cIn the course of reconciling accounts that, due to the unprecedented circumstances of the last quarter, have not been as current as we would ordinarily maintain, certain transfers have proven difficult to substantiate, though we anticipate swift clarity.\u201d I hated me and my education a little, and then I did what you do and printed it and put it on a desk and watched as someone else signed their name to it. Priya caught my eye and did not offer solace, because we had used an entire week\u2019s supply of it on the girl at the shoreline.\n\nThat evening, in a small act of penance I may have imagined, I went to Mrs. Pell to buy bread and eggs and she told me a story about the time her husband put too many bulbs in a patch of dirt and the spring had a tantrum. Iris came in halfway through and bought lemons and honey and a newspaper she would not read, and we walked out together and she said, \u201cWould you like to see the painting I turned to face the wall again because it refused to be moral?\u201d\n\nIt was not so much a painting of a body as it was the idea of bone in light. The collarbone that had made me want to confess was there, but not as a seduction; it was there as a hinge. Another line curved with the modesty of someone who had decided to be naked without inviting anyone to comment on it. The colors were not colors you would use if you were trying to sell anything. They were the colors left at the bottom of a palette after a day, the ones you get when you mix decisions. It was beautiful and disturbing and I loved it in the way you love something that has already made up its mind.\n\n\u201cYou see why I turned it,\u201d she said, and I said yes although I did not, entirely, and it is possible she knew that about me. \u201cSome things need a wall to think. Some things need looking. I wish sometimes that I could be more decisive about which are which.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could do what Dawson does,\u201d I said, because I am rude when I am tender sometimes. \u201cYou could sign a letter that says both and neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh yes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then make soup.\u201d\n\nWe ate in my kitchen because kitchens like to tell you their own stories and are less earnest about it than dining rooms. The soup was Mina\u2019s and tasted like someone had paid attention to carrots. We ate on stools, because chairs felt too formal for broth. Iris kept her sleeve rolled more to her elbow that night, and I looked and did not look, and she saw me doing both, and neither of us apologized. After we had done the dishes, which we did with an argument about which sponge is best for pans, which we enjoyed more than we should have, we stood very close because the kitchen is a small legal jurisdiction and we had both violated several ordinances already. She put her hand on the back of my head and I put my hand at her waist and we kissed like we were saying thank you to the same invisible benefactor.\n\nThere were still moments when my body did its small animal thing and shifted away from the line of ink like it had been taught by an unwise ancestor to avoid certain plants. I told it, gently, to be quiet, and it obeyed as well as bodies ever obey their owners. Iris noticed when I was brave and when I wasn\u2019t, and neither of those seem to be the parts of me she was tabulating for a verdict.\n\nOne late afternoon, when the light pretended to return at four and then withdrew the promise like a politician, Mina came by with a Tupperware and a look. She did not knock in the way most people knock; she announced herself with the scraping of her shoe on the mat like a cricket. Iris let her in and they stood in the hall and did small dances with their hands. I stayed on the couch, eyes on a book I was only pretending to be reading.\n\n\u201cYou told him about the letters,\u201d Mina said, voice low but not secret. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\u201cI showed him,\u201d Iris said. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him the parts that belong to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him the parts that he thinks belong to him,\u201d Mina said. \u201cIt will save you both time later.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am telling you both now,\u201d Iris said, raising her voice just enough to let me in on the fact that I had been let in deliberately, \u201cthat I wrote a letter once to someone I had not met and it said his name and it was the wrong person and I sent it anyway and it was a mess and then I learned not to do that. I keep them now because keeping is a kindness. This is not a coded thing meant to make you perform, Bret, it is a confession of an old method. I do not want you to be jealous of a girl who loved a person she had invented. There are real people to be jealous of, and we can timetable them.\u201d\n\nWe all laughed then, the kind of laugh that says yes to the right joke and no to the wrong ones. I put the book down without pretending further and went to the hall and took the Tupperware from Mina like a notary. \u201cYou will be all right,\u201d she said to me, and I would have liked to know whether she meant tonight, or this month, or the year, or the great abstract elevator that will one day take us all down to the ground floor, but I did not ask her to be precise.\n\nWhen she had gone, Iris turned to me and looked like the sort of person who can taste iron in water. \u201cI do not want to mislead you,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mark on my arm is not about you, and it is not not about you. It is about the part of me that promised, long ago, not to let a certain thing happen to me again. No one broke me. I am not doing this to rebuke anyone. I am putting a rope around the pit in the ground and writing the word pit around it in very large letters so that when I walk I can see where I must not step. That is the absence. I do not know if you are the kind of person who will pretend you do not see a rope when someone has put one there. I hope you are not. Sometimes men are terrible at ropes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am excellent at ropes in theory,\u201d I said, with a seriousness that surprised me. \u201cIn practice I will need to be told I am at the edge because my eyes are not clever and I have been taught to look at the sky to see if the weather is coming.\u201d\n\nShe put her hand over my mouth the way you do not put your hand over someone\u2019s mouth in public, and I kissed her palm in a way that made her criticize me later for being glib and then agree to it again six minutes after that. We were ridiculous and correct.\n\nIt is necessary, too, to say that in that same week my neat life put its elbow on the wrong lever. Dawson called me into his office at the end of a day that had already given me seven reasons to pretend to faint, and he said, with the weariness that makes men perform their dignity too loudly, that Langley had found the sums himself, mis-shelved in a spreadsheet like a book put away under the wrong initial. We would be able to say that our letter had produced clarity. He was pleased with himself in a way that made me want to dress him in humility. Priya rolled her chair to my doorway after and said, \u201cI suppose we have not been invited to drown ourselves in the Ver in penance,\u201d and I said, \u201cNo,\u201d and then, because the room needed it, \u201cBut we could go to the park and listen to the geese swear.\u201d\n\nWe did. We sat on the damp bench and watched the river lecture itself into curves, and the crows patrolled like moralists who had forgotten their first point, and the ducks had arguments with themselves and won and lost them in the same gulp. Priya took a small metal flask from her coat with deliberate theatre and produced a drink that had the decency to be harsh. She offered and I accepted and the heat it made in my throat felt like a hand on my sternum telling me to sit still.\n\n\u201cYou look like someone who is learning a new language,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cThe kind they don\u2019t teach at school, because school panics at nuance. You are excellent with nuance at work. It appears you are less excellent at it when your shirt is off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to be inelegant in front of people,\u201d I said, and she snorted and looked away at the exact right angle to make the snort love instead of cruelty.\n\n\u201cYou should try it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may find the person you are really very competent at falling on his face. Some of us measure our competence in wrong units. Do you want to tell me the honoring version of what is happening, or do you want to tell me the version where you come off better. I am available for both.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe put a thing on her arm,\u201d I said, because I had to name it somewhere. \u201cAnd my body decided to be cowardly, and then my brain tried to pretend my body had made a typo. I am working on my body\u2019s literacy. Also there are letters. And a boy with a trumpet who is preventing the apocalypse.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said after a long pause, during which a goose made a noise like a derogatory memoir. \u201cI approve of almost everything you just said. It is appalling that you had to get a girlfriend before realizing that bodies are part of the bargain and not just devices for transporting heads and briefcases.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not\u2014 we have not\u2014\u201d I said, and then gave up the ditch because it was not worth defending. \u201cShe told me about a rope around a pit. I think there is a rope around a pit. I am not good at identifying pits.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are excellent at documentation,\u201d she said. \u201cDraw a map. Put a rope on it. Write pit where necessary. And then for once in your life do not argue with a woman who knows what she is talking about when she says, Here, the ground gives way. Also, do not be jealous of old letters. Jealousy of paper is the most humiliating of male sports.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will put away my green ribbon,\u201d I said. \u201cI will write in my little book, Pit here, and try to remember not to picnic on its edge.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d she said, which I should have hated and did not. We watched the river keep being water and not morals. The cathedral peeped over the trees like an ancient friend who does not want to intrude. We went home and the city did not mind.\n\nThe next morning there was a note on my step with a fish that had corrected its own smile. It said, Back Thursday, Arundel. It turned out she had taken a train to a town she liked because the lines on the map there were satisfying, and she sent me a photograph of a castle and a river that had decided to be decorative. I read the note and read an entire library of other things into it because I am my own enemy sometimes. I wanted, absurdly, to ask her to take me with her into places where my neatness would be useless and my usefulness would be tested. I wanted to do my work and to sit and not be good. I am no longer certain I will get to have both. I put the note on my mantel with the candle crater and the pen, and I left it there like a person who knows he is building a mantel the way other people build altars and is too prudent to call it that out loud.\n\nShe returned on Thursday smelling like rain that had learned manners in a different town. We met on the path without needing to pretend we were surprised, and she told me about a woman selling sandwiches who said Arundel like it was a verb, and how she watched a child say no to a dog very politely and how the dog obeyed because politeness is a language dogs like to practice. She had bought me a postcard of a medieval figure with a sword who looked like a person in a good suit and a bad mood, and she had written on the back, For the days when the law sharpens itself on you, and I put it on the fridge with a magnet shaped like a lemon because that is where it looked pleased.\n\nThat night, the trumpet did not play. The fox did not scream. The street made a pause, and the pause held. Iris sat on my floor because chairs are less honest than floors, her sleeve rolled, her arm a new map I was learning to read with the right kind of caution, and we spoke like people who had decided to be both old and very young in the same hour. When I went to bed, I did not do the inventory of corners. I lay on my back and let the dark take attendance, and for once I did not worry that it would mark me absent. Somewhere, in a drawer, a letter with my name in someone else\u2019s hand waited, and I did not open it. I looked at the ceiling until it blurred into a color I could not name, and I thought, I could get good at this, and a part of me that has never trusted anything agreed out loud.The week decided to open with an envelope that had the humor to pretend it was just paper. It waited on Iris\u2019s step with its serious blue lettering like something you ought to put down before you realized that you were holding it at all. The rain had tried itself on once or twice and stepped back into the cupboard, and the pavement was the kind of cool that makes your breath feel like the glass it fogs. I saw the envelope before I saw her, which is not how I prefer the order of things, and for a moment I thought, perversely, of Christmas and its confident red and green, how invitations arrive wearing costumes to tell you how to treat them. This one wore a costume that said, You will not enjoy me.\n\nShe opened the door with her hair a fraction less deliberate than usual, a sweater with threads the color of cut pears, and a look that was not yet surrender. The corner of the paper had gone soft from being carried around the living room while she decided where to sit with it. She held it up like a specimen she hoped I would identify kindly and said, \u201cIt says Notice,\u201d and then added, as if quoting a particularly ungenerous friend, \u201cSection Twenty-One.\u201d She said the number with an accuracy that made the air around it respectful.\n\nMy body did its professional rearrangement. Even in a doorway with oranges plotting their mutiny in a bag at my feet, you can feel your organs pick up clipboards and take attendance. I took it, and I did the quick read you do when the blood is busy and you have to look like you can persuade it to stand still. It was what it was: time dressed in legal language. Sixty days offered like a joke without a punchline. The name of a letting agent with a logo that tried for inheritance and landed on dentistry. A signature that had practiced being important.\n\n\u201cDid he speak to you?\u201d I asked, keeping my voice in the register you use when children have just woken up from a troubling dream and you have agreed to pretend there are no monsters in the wardrobe while the monsters themselves write a polite letter.\n\n\u201cOnly by van,\u201d she said, smiling without moving her mouth. \u201cHe was outside yesterday with a ladder doing something aristocratic to a gutter, and when I waved the wave you wave at ladders he executed a very precise look in the opposite direction. This arrived after lunch. Mina told me to sit down with it on a hard chair, the way you sit with guests you are not inclined to coddle.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a surprise,\u201d I said to the part of her that did not want the words and to the part that expected them anyway. \u201cIt is, however, not the end. There are rules about deposits and clocks and how you say a thing before you get to do it. We can make the clock behave for you for now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake the clock behave,\u201d she said, tasting the words as if they were soup and needed salt. \u201cI thought that is what the candles were for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe candles are for the soul,\u201d I said, not entirely in jest. \u201cThe letters are for the clock.\u201d\n\nShe stood aside and I followed her into the house that had just been told by an envelope that it might have to stop being itself. The room felt like a person who has put their hands in their pockets to be polite. On the mantel the jar for her arm sat like an appointment, and on the windowsill the plant did its best impression of optimism. She put the letter on the table as if it might leap off and confess its motives if it thought no one was looking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go yet,\u201d she said, almost diffident with the confession. \u201cI have just told the walls that they have work to do and they have not yet finished being what I asked them to be. I know houses are not dogs. I know they do not come when you call. I just\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are allowed to want,\u201d I said, which is an absurdity that occasionally still needs saying out loud. \u201cWe will make the timetable tell the truth about itself. Let me see your tenancy, and the deposit, and any versions of conversations you have had with him, and what the world thinks your notice period is. Sometimes there are small errors. Sometimes those errors are enough to make the universe revise its plans.\u201d\n\nShe put a hand over the paper in a way that would have been an oath if there had been a book under it. \u201cYou will not wear your tie at me,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean\u2014 you will not become a man made entirely of velcro and Latin at me. I would like you to be Bret in a jumper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be Bret in a jumper,\u201d I said, which was true in both the literal and the complicated sense. \u201cMy Latin is in a drawer. I will only take it out if the letter is rude in a language I can\u2019t persuade with English.\u201d\n\nWe did the work, which is to say we put the kettle on as the universe requires before we do anything that intends to change another thing. She had the papers in a folder more dignified than our purpose deserved; the deposit had been put somewhere correct but late; the gas certificate had missed a year the way years sometimes fall through the cracks of people who have decided to be careless as a hobby. I took notes in my small book with the pen she had found in a video in Japan, and it felt like using a scalpel to slice bread. When I used words like compliance they landed in the room and did not ruin it, which is a skill I wish I always had.\n\n\u201cWe can write,\u201d I said, and she nodded like writing was a verb she could endorse. \u201cWe can ask for clarification with the sort of politeness that makes men behave. We can ask for the mistakes to make themselves useful. We can make the clock say a different hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say we very beautifully,\u201d she said, racking two mugs on top of one another as if building a little shelter. \u201cYou say it like a verb instead of like a pronoun.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is always better when we can be a verb,\u201d I said. \u201cPronouns are fine for introductions. Verbs repair gutters.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, when we had put the paper back into its temporary coffin and the letter into a sleeve as if it were contagious, we sat, and the room returned to being a room where two people had lived for an hour instead of a courtroom in a cardigan. She rested her forearm on the table, and the dressing shone, a neat admission that bodies insist on time when time misbehaves.\n\n\u201cIt is a cruelty,\u201d she said, looking at the window without seeing it, \u201chow rooms have to unlearn you. All your shapes go out of them like the tide, and they sit there as if no one had ever put down a cup and left a small witness ring. I am not noble. I have not earned the right to be moved.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one asks nobility from the moved,\u201d I said, and the part of me that knows what words do felt the small heat that comes when one lands near the right place. \u201cThe only noble thing here is the kettle.\u201d\n\nShe laughed then, sudden and grateful and more for herself than for me. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cGood kettle. Brave kettle. We will write to the man in the van and tell him that he must also become a kettle.\u201d\n\nWe did. Priya, later, took my draft and softened three things and sharpened two and removed one sentence that had been included for the pleasure of seeing if I could write it, which is a bad habit I pretend is not a habit. She read the notice with her eyebrows making their very specific shapes and said, \u201cDeposits are always the weak link because men like to keep small suns in drawers,\u201d and I loved her for the way she can be both tender and clinical without contaminating either. Dawson peered at the letter and said something florid about the rights of tenants that I will not repeat because it will ruin your supper, and then looked at me with a paternal benevolence that sat on him like a hat that had been left too near a radiator.\n\nBefore the letter could make its journey with stamps attached like confident birds, Thursday came and with it the boy and his precise noise. The square behind the hospital had bins that had once been yellow and now were the color of tobacco. The courtyard has an acoustics that was clearly designed by a committee of very clean people. The nurse with the braid and the authority of a person who knows where syringes live stood in a doorway and pretended not to watch. Iris, alert to languages I barely hear, had asked if she could come and listen and say nothing, and the boy had made the shrug that is a yes when you are sixteen and practicing how to carry permission without letting it leak.\n\nHe played scales like fences and then like rivers. At one point he did something no trumpet owes anyone, a soft unambitious melody that turned the air into a small apology. I stood with my coat unbuttoned because I wanted to be honest to the cold. Iris put her hand in mine half-way through a note that made a particular window on the third floor decide to tremble, and I had the brief and pure sensation of being included. A shadow moved in that window, and then a wrist and then a palm and then the absence of gesture that is sometimes more eloquent than any wave. I did not know if the sister saw us; I suspected that even if she had, the seeing would have been for herself.\n\nA security guard with shoes softened by long corridors approached and did the thing that makes me respect men in uniforms: he looked like he was rehearsing the kind of authority that could hold the room and then chose not to perform it in public. He nodded to the boy and said, \u201cThree more minutes,\u201d and the boy made a sound with his lips that meant, to my amazement, gratitude. Iris did something subtle with her body, an angle of her shoulders and the tilt of her head, and the sound changed in a way that made the space around us feel like it had been re-tuned. Afterwards, when the nurse with the braid spoke to us, she said, \u201cThank you for being small,\u201d and I wrote that down, because it is not a sentence I had expected and I want to be asked, again, to make myself less of a problem.\n\nOn the way back we walked through streets that have decided to be deeply themselves in February. The shop that sells bulbs in cages had replaced moons with stars in smaller cages. The charity shop had admitted a piano that took up important breathing room and was called SPLENDID on a paper sign by someone who had not played it. The boy had told us the sister\u2019s name. It lives in my mouth now like a fragile instrument and I will not put it here because not everything is ours.\n\n\u201cMy mother used to call Thursday small Friday,\u201d Iris said, stepping over a puddle that had pretensions to be a lake. \u201cShe was always trying to get the week to move faster, as if she had somewhere to be that did not involve us. When I was little I would hide her keys, which is a terrible thing I am not proud of, but I would do it and then cry when she left anyway because you cannot ever hide what a person has decided to be. I think I am sometimes hiding keys still, and I would like to apologize to anyone who has been late because of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was late the day I saw you,\u201d I said, which is partly true and mostly myth, and the truth is something like a rope around a pit anyway.\n\n\u201cThen you have forgiven me in advance,\u201d she said, and the look she gave me did useful things to the architecture of my throat.\n\nThat night I spoke to my mother with the ease of a person placing something on a shelf and the difficulty of someone trying to find a shelf that will not immediately come down on his head. She asked me if I was eating, which I answered with a piece of chicken on a plate as evidence, and then she asked me if I was sleeping, which I answered by moving my eyes very slightly away from the camera. She uses the names of days as if they were types of weather. When I told her about Iris, not everything, because I am not good at enough and she is better at it than I am, she said, \u201cAn artist, is she,\u201d in the tone that puts an extra comma in the sentence, and I did my best only child thing and said that I had been to services where a thousand candles made strangers into a temporary nation and that I had held a hand in a square behind a building that smelled like disinfectant and promises, and that nothing had burned down, and that sometimes when you do something in a room, the room agrees. She looked at me as if I had managed to use a screwdriver without supervision and told me a story about a neighbour who kept peacocks and never swept their complaints off the path, and I realized that she was telling me she had decided not to be afraid of my news.\n\nIt was a small reprieve to go to work and let numbers bite at ankles instead of letters. There was a morning where I lost an hour finding a comma I should not have lost, which is a separate species of shame, and then there was a call from Mr. Langley\u2019s assistant who has a voice like someone who used to teach piano to surgeons, and she told me that Mr. Langley would send a bottle and a note and that he did not like to think of things as mis-shelved, only temporarily disguised as other things, and would I be so good as to assent to his version of the world in writing. I wrote a note that said nothing in the precise way you are taught when you are first given a suit, and I put it in an envelope that did not deserve my name on it. When the bottle arrived, Dawson opened it with the relish of a man playing at ships, and we took a glass and did the thing you do where you look meaningful at each other over liquid you cannot afford alone.\n\nPriya leaned in my door later and said, \u201cDo you want to tell me now or later that you are in love with someone with a map,\u201d and I said, \u201cLater,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood, we will be inefficient with our time for once,\u201d and then the afternoon did that thing it does where it lies down and refuses to be roused, and we gave up and walked down to the river and let the cold show us our edges.\n\nWhen I got home there was a note pushed under my door with the fish grinning as if he had made himself a promotion. It said, I want to show you something, but not if your brain is made of lawsuits. I considered honestly whether my brain could be returned to meat in time and decided yes, with conditions. I knocked and she pulled me into a room that had had its furniture rearranged by someone who had learned the philosophy of chairs overnight. On the table, the square box of days had been opened and would not close properly because it was at capacity, and around it were sheets of paper more serious than canvas, the kind you buy when your wrists have ambitions. On one of them, in the cleanest black I have seen outside of a crow\u2019s wing, was a diagram.\n\n\u201cIt is a lie,\u201d she said before I could speak. \u201cIt is also true. It is the rope as seen from above. I put the pit on paper so that if I forget and if a person asks me to be generous about my memory, I can point at it and say, Here. The pit does not move. It does not have feelings. It is geography. We do not forgive geography; we go around it or we fall in and then we tell the story. I told the tattooist they could write absence so small in the lines that no one would read it but me, but he said ink is not good at secrets, and I said that is the point.\u201d\n\nI stood with my hands carefully in the air above my pockets like a man in a museum who trusts his arms only when they have been assigned chairs. The drawing was both elegant and, somehow, almost shy about its own edges. The negative space in it had a shape like someone standing sideways in a doorway. It was undeniably beautiful and it was also a thing that made me angry because it made me want to be better than I was, and I do not always enjoy being given homework by art.\n\n\u201cMay I be stupid for a minute,\u201d I asked, and she looked at me the way a very good teacher looks at a boy who is about to be very brave in front of a room. \u201cWhen you say pit, I think of the place I put all the versions of myself that were not promoted. I understand that your pit is not that. I am trying not to make it mine. I do not wish to picnic where you learned to count.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may be stupid for more than a minute,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may be stupid as a method. I will tell you when your stupidity is a fence and when it is a path. The only thing I will not have is your pretending not to see the drawing when it is on the table. Men pretend not to see drawings and it makes the world unbearable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see the drawing,\u201d I said, and she nodded, satisfied not at my compliance but at my transparency. She put the diagram in the box on top of the day that looked like a thin sheet of bone and the lid almost shut. We stood in our two houses with our one fence and the eighth of an inch between politeness and the lack of it, and then we did not stand anymore because standing is a ceremony that has to be interrupted if it is not to become worship.\n\nThe letter to the man with the van did its work. His agent wrote back in a tone that had been curated to sound competent, and informed us that the deposit had indeed been put somewhere like a dragon sitting on a plate and that the notice would be reissued with apologies, and that obviously it had nothing to do with anything except how the world is, and would she be so good as to admit that. We sent them a paragraph about gas certificates that sounded like a lullaby if you did not speak the language, and I gave Iris a timetable that looked like an arrangement with winter. She put it on the back of a cupboard with tape that had had a life before this and saluted it each morning like it had saved hers, which is a habit I am going to adopt for the calendar above my desk.\n\nThere was a night when Mina appeared with an umbrella and a face that had argued with a bus driver and won, and she brought a parcel the size of a clementine and said, \u201cSmell,\u201d and we did and it smelled like green. She told me a story about a woman in her twenties who had been given a plant by a man who asked nothing in return, and how the plant had died immediately because sometimes kindness is a shock to the system. She told Iris she had found a frame in a shop that was secretly made of good wood and that she had bought it against the day when a day demanded existing twice. She told me that if we wrote to the man with the ladder in a way that made him afraid of his own conscience we would be doing him a favor. There are people who are engines in rooms, and you do not know the wattage until the light changes.\n\nLater, after Mina left us a recipe that was more of a reminder, Iris took down a bundle of letters and put one in my hand with the care you give a child a fragile thing: do not drop it, do not run with it, do not try to eat it even if it is sweet. The paper had been folded and folded and then smoothed and then folded again the way skin folds over time regardless of whether you approve. On the front, my name in someone else\u2019s hand, a past version of hers who wrote like a person running to catch up with herself.\n\n\u201cYou can read that one if you want,\u201d she said, ambiguously generous. \u201cIt does not betray anyone. It is the letter where I invented a lamp and told it it was you. Be cautious with my sixteen-year-old sense of drama. I have largely forgiven her. Mostly I am grateful to her for doing the first draft.\u201d\n\nI read, hungry and then careful. She wrote about the light in a shop on a wet day, and the way people\u2019s faces behaved differently in the reflection of glass than they do in front of themselves, and about a boy whose name was mine who laughed at a joke and then took it back, and about the river when it decides to be sounded like pennies and mirrors, and about the woman who sold lemons in a bag that made everything else the lemon thought about. She wrote like someone who could not keep ink in a bottle, and if I had met her then I would have been no use to her at all. I folded it back into itself with reverent incompetence and gave it back, and the look on Iris\u2019s face when I did that will endure longer in me than any case law I will ever cite.\n\nThe following Thursday the boy did not appear and the square was like a mouth that had forgotten a word. We stood anyway and did the respectful nothing that attendance is; the nurse with the braid nodded at us like we were the right kind of harmless, and then, just when a silence had started to think itself the only thing left, the boy came running with his case, and he did the kind of panting apology that includes the thing but also apologizes for the day. \u201cThey moved her,\u201d he said, so quickly the words slid into each other and became objects. \u201cDifferent window. I had to find the new echo.\u201d\n\nHe looked so young then that my chest did the involuntary thing it does when you hear a body announce its age without meaning to. Iris put her hand on the case as if steadying the instrument and the boy in the same gesture, and she said, \u201cWe will learn it with you.\u201d He blew a note and the courtyard made its best effort to be useful. The new window was where the building had decided to tuck a kindness it had not told anyone about. We stayed longer than we should and no one told us to leave, which is how the world earns a reprieve.\n\nOn the street that night, with the lights doing that pleased-with-themselves thing they do when they are the only decoration anyone can afford, the landlord\u2019s van was out front of number 12 and the ladder was in performance. He was a man with a face like a door that tries to look like a window. He stepped down in that careful way men step down when they have been told their balance is admirable and they do not want to insult the compliment by falling. He saw me seeing him and did a small calculation and found his manners. \u201cAll right?\u201d he said, in the dialect of men who will let you starve in their kitchens and ask if you have eaten.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, which is a code for not at all. \u201cYour agent received our letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, eyes travelling past my shoulder to my window because people look at windows when they are thinking about money. \u201cLot of fuss. My cousin says if you live up north you can just tell people what to do and the roof agrees. But I don\u2019t live up north and my cousin is an idiot, so we\u2019ll do it by the book. She all right in there?\u201d He jerked his head in the direction of Iris\u2019s door with a theatrical casualness that made me want to nail politeness to the front of his van.\n\n\u201cShe is all right in there,\u201d I said. \u201cShe is better than all right. She has art on the walls.\u201d\n\nHe made a face like a person who has just remembered a childhood injury he cannot prove. \u201cArt,\u201d he said, with the tone of a plumber who has discovered a skylight where there ought to have been a pipe. \u201cRight. Tell her I won\u2019t be unreasonable.\u201d Then he climbed his ladder as if he'd just learned to do it that way and had been complimented on the improvement.\n\nI told her what he had said and she laughed, not out of cruelty but out of the relief that comes when fear has to perform under supervision. \u201cUnreasonable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will send him a ribbon if he manages it. We will write Thank you for being average on it in neat italics.\u201d\n\nWe continued to be the kind of selves we were making with each other. There were mornings when she left before I did and I would find the smell of her tea in the hallway like a small echo. There were nights when I forgot to be efficient with sleep because her hair had decided to classify itself as geography and I had argued with it the way men argue with maps. The absence on her arm healed into something that seemed at home with itself, and the first time she swam after it\u2014 in a pool that had decided to be generous at an off-hour, with a lifeguard the color of brick and a sign that said NO BOMBING as if anyone had tried recently\u2014 she emerged and stood and the water made a hundred versions of the same decision, and I had the thought that if there is a God, he is suspicious of fences but he approves of towels.\n\nPriya, vigilant and unromantic, asked me on a Monday whether I had stopped mistaking weather for plot yet and I told her I was failing honorably. She said that was acceptable as long as I continued to turn up to court with both shoes.\n\nThe trouble with clocks is that they keep their appointments even when you have been clever around them. The reissued letter arrived with the redress of mistakes attached like a ribbon. The date had moved; the intention had not. Sixty days coiled on our table; sixty days pretending to be neutral. We laid out calendars the way you lay out cutlery and gave each day a job and a number and I drew lines between them with the same steady hand I use when I escort words through a document nobody wants to read.\n\n\u201cWe can plan so hard we forget to inhabit the plan,\u201d Iris said, because of course she said it. \u201cWe will write, we will argue, we will ask the council to remember me like a good pupil, and we will paint the days, and we will also drink our tea while it is hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will,\u201d I said, which was a vow trained in a cathedral and let loose on a kitchen.\n\nI did not know what form the interruption would take and I am embarrassed by that, because interruptions have a grammar and you can learn it if you listen in the hall for long enough. It arrived as a message from a small device in my pocket that has more status than it should and it said that my father had fallen, which is not a verb I like attached to the person who taught me to stand on a chair very early and not be foolish about it. He had fallen in a garden that used to be a proper garden and had treasured leaks weeping in ancient taps that had always done their best, and he had been found by a neighbor who kept dahlias in disciplined rows and judgments in looser ones, and he was at the place with the disinfectant and the bins and the echo. I stood very still while the room discovered how to make itself into a hallway and Iris came near me in a way that did not ask permission because some kinds of touch are not about permission but about gravity, and she said nothing and waited as if waiting was a profession she had been practicing for years.\n\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d I said, and she nodded so that the nod might carry me, and Mina appeared without having been called with a scarf like a banner and a bag with the sort of things in it you only know to bring if you were a mother once and can still smell when soup is required in a different house. The street had the courtesy to be smaller while I put a coat on the wrong way and then the right way, and the bells, because they have a schedule, did not ring for me.\n\nAt the hospital, corridors bent like questions. My father sat up, which relieved me to an extent I am ashamed of, and held his mouth as if it might say things of its own accord if not supervised. He saw me and did the thing men do between other men when tenderness cannot find a place to sit, which is to insult the obvious. \u201cYou look tired,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cSo do you,\u201d and then he shut his eyes because something about the arrangement of lights had decided to be too much effort and I was suddenly and completely made of patience. The nurse with the braid passed us and I had the ridiculous and unhelpful thought that the hospital had only commissioned one nurse and used her gently in all rooms like a good lamp.\n\nHe was fine, they said. It is a word that was not made for fathers. A hip bruised, not broken. A head examined and found intact and, astonishingly, a hip flask produced from a pocket with a comedy that made the doctor put his hand on the wall. I walked him home under a sky that had decided to apologise for a thing I had not heard, and in his kitchen, which is a museum of floating screws and jars with uses only he can articulate, he told me a story about his first case as a plumber, and I told him nothing that would make him afraid of me, which is a kind of kindness I wish we did not owe our parents. When I left, he stood with his hand on the edge of the door and said, too casually, \u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d and I said, too quickly, \u201cYes,\u201d and then we both laughed at each other because neither of us are convincing liars.\n\nI walked back along the Alban Way because when you are trying to put your chest into a shape people can tolerate, a path without houses is a good idea. The trumpet boy passed me at a run, case against his thigh, and I did not stop him because some urgencies are ordinary and do not require witness. When I turned onto Clarence Road, Iris was at my door, leaning with her forehead against the cold pane lightly as if listening to a rumor. She looked up and came towards me in three steps that were not dramatic and still did the necessary thing, and she put her hand on my face and held it there and taught the skin to be calm again.\n\n\u201cSoup,\u201d she said, and I almost cried because I had not realized how many problems use the same solution. We went inside and the room organized itself around us politely and I told her about the fall and she told me about a painting that had failed in an interesting way and we made being alive together look like an activity that had instructions but did not need them. Afterwards, when we had done the dishes with the right sponge\u2014 do not write to me about sponges; I will not be moved\u2014 and when the street had decided that it would let us be obscure for a few hours, she said, \u201cIf I disappear for a day because the new rope tugs me, will you come find me,\u201d and this time I said, \u201cYes, and I will be tedious about it,\u201d and we both agreed that sometimes tedium is love in work clothes.\n\nThe envelope with the landlord\u2019s second intentions continued to be itself on the cupboard door. The boy\u2019s sister moved rooms and windows and we tracked her like saints with an app. Priya gave me a list of men worse than me and told me to stand at the end of it with dignity. Mina told me that when she left the country she loved she took photographs of the taps in the sinks of public buildings because sometimes that is how you carry water with you. The fox acquired a limp and then discarded it on a Monday like an accessory.\n\nI would like to tell you that Chapter Six is where I learned to be easy. It is not. It is where I learned that absence is a thing you can draw and still be surprised by the hole when you step into it. It is where a letter wore a coat and rang my neighbor\u2019s bell and made us put diagrams on the table. It is where a boy learned a new echo and where a father performed gravity and where a van decided to be civil. It is where hands learned new permissions and the kettle kept behaving even when time refused to. You would think that would be enough for a person. You would be wrong, but only by an inch, which in some rooms is all the difference between falling and staying upright.The day the council wrote back, the envelope was the color of earnest potatoes. It sat on my mat with an authority it hadn\u2019t quite earned and made the hall into a tiny office. I picked it up and my hand did the ridiculous tremor it reserves for documents that might change the furniture. Iris appeared the way she has learned to appear when letters arrive\u2014she does not make a noise; she is simply there, as if summoned by the warding ink on the front. We stood with our shoulders almost touching and made the complicated decision to open it in my kitchen rather than hers, as if the kettle could confer jurisdiction.\n\nInside, the words behaved. They told us someone would \u201cengage\u201d with her \u201csituation\u201d and \u201cassess her vulnerability\u201d in a tone that made vulnerability sound like a hobby gone too far. There were bullet points that attempted kindness and a list of dates that would be our dates now whether we liked them or not. Near the bottom, there was the sentence I had been wanting and dreading: \u201cWe will require evidence.\u201d I could have written it myself on any day in my career and hated me for the neatness of the phrase.\n\n\u201cI have evidence,\u201d Iris said, sitting and laying her arm along the edge of the table with an ease that was not yet ease and not yet not. \u201cI have a whole museum. Receipts. Letters. Photographs of gutters behaving badly. Paintings of days. Would they like a box of colors. Would they like a trumpet. Would they like my mother\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will want the kinds of evidence less persuasive than those,\u201d I said, because the truth does not always help. \u201cBut we can bring both kinds and let the room decide if one can teach the other.\u201d\n\nShe wrapped both hands around her mug and nodded like a person agreeing with a sensible song. The dressing on her arm had been gone for a week, and the ink had learned her skin and her skin had learned its ink, and sometimes my eyes forgot to flinch and sometimes they did not, and on those days I kept my hands busy with spoons. She looked at the council letter again and smiled with no teeth. \u201cEngage,\u201d she said. \u201cThey make engagement sound like a duel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I said. \u201cOnly with clipboards.\u201d\n\nWe started to gather proof in piles that should not have looked beautiful and did. Mina arrived with a plastic folder that had clearly been repurposed from a schoolboy some decades ago and put on the table the exact sort of biscuits people tell themselves they don\u2019t like. \u201cDo not be original,\u201d she said, tapping the letter with two fingers that have signed more petitions than I will ever read. \u201cOriginality makes civil servants nervous. You will bring them the buttons they recognize and then later you will show them ribbons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a drawer of ribbons,\u201d Iris said, and Mina smiled like someone whose belief in her had found fresh reasons.\n\nThere were practical intrusions too, because clocks keep their promises. The letting agent, having learned the word compliance recently, discovered the word viewing. He phoned in the tone of a dentist announcing a minor procedure and asked whether \u201cprospective tenants\u201d might be introduced to the rooms \u201cat convenient intervals,\u201d by which he meant at intervals convenient to his commute. Iris handed me the phone without commentary and I became the man with the voice I keep for other men who have invoices.\n\n\u201cYou will give twenty-four hours\u2019 notice in writing,\u201d I said, as if we were discussing weather. \u201cYou will propose times. You will receive refusals. You will propose different times. You will be reasonable. And you will not tell anyone she has to let people into the place where she keeps her sleep.\u201d\n\nThere was a silence into which a smaller man might have poured apology. This man poured policy. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be accommodating.\u201d He said accommodating like a room with too much furniture. We wrote him a letter anyway, to make the law sit near us on the rug.\n\nWhen the first viewing came, everything in number 12 made itself look like itself. The plant stood up straighter; the sofa decided not to be apologetic; the three turned canvases on the opposite wall remained turned, which felt like an act of mercy. Iris drew a chalk line on the hall floor in a clean arc from the skirting board to the edge of the door and looked at it with an expression so grave the chalk nearly curtsied. \u201cBoundary,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will be polite to them. They will not step over this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to be unpolite,\u201d I said, and then I ruined my own sentence with a smile.\n\n\u201cI like being unpolite with purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cNot for sport.\u201d\n\nThe agent arrived with keys and nervousness. With him came a couple who had the careful happiness of people who had been looking for a long time and had agreed between themselves to not betray how much they wanted to be done looking. Behind them was a single man in a jacket that considered itself performance and a woman with a clipboard who wore her hair like a declaration of independence. We introduced the rooms like they were shy children. The man in the jacket walked to the mantel and fingered the jar with ointment and the jar looked up at me and said, silently, please remove him. The woman with the clipboard asked about boilers in a way I approved. The couple stood together like geography and looked at the light as if they had applications to submit to it.\n\nIris spoke very little. She had learned to be small without diminishing, a skill I cannot teach. When the man in the jacket opened his mouth to say something about \u201cthe vibe,\u201d Mina, who had appeared to water the plant at the exact inconvenient moment, turned to him and said, with a smile that could butter knives, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you like the walls. The walls like to be treated well. They remember.\u201d\n\nAfter, when the door shut with the sigh a door makes when it has been made to work too hard, Iris and I stood within the chalk arc and not outside it. I felt in that small pale curve the full intelligence of the rope she had spoken into the skin of her arm, and a contrition I did not owe anyone presented itself anyway. She looked at my face like she was skimming a book she knows by heart and nodded, as if to say, all right then, you were paying attention.\n\nAt work, Dawson produced a file in a color that has never meant anything good. He put it on my desk like an expensive brick and said, with the benevolence of a man about to ask a favor which he does not intend ever to repay, that a partner at another firm would be grateful if we could address \u201cinformal arrangements\u201d in \u201ca family matter\u201d with \u201cdiscretion,\u201d which is a cousin of secrecy that eats better. The details brought the worst out of the paper: money, yes, and property, and in the middle of it two boys who had shared a bedroom until someone left and took all the air with him. The client wanted to be reassured that the law would not punish him for how he had arranged his life after the leaving and before the paperwork caught up. I have patience up to a line. It is possible the line was painted on the floor when I wasn\u2019t watching.\n\n\u201cIs there violence,\u201d I asked, which is the first question when everything has already started moving furniture.\n\nDawson did a face. \u201cNothing actionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cActionable is a poverty of language,\u201d I said, which is a thing Priya has taught me to say out loud even when men are wearing good coats.\n\nPriya stole the file when Dawson left the room and put her finger under the sentence that said \u201cexclusive occupation,\u201d as if it were a splinter. \u201cThey want to move the children like chairs,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou can say no with a very pretty voice if you need to.\u201d\n\nI took the file home and put it on my table next to Iris\u2019s timetable because we do not live lives where subjects can be segregated well. She looked at the top sheet and made a small noise in her throat that meant she could smell iron again. \u201cWill you be good,\u201d she asked, without tone, and I answered with the same absence of theatre, \u201cI will try.\u201d\n\nI found myself, that week, holding pens like weapons. The fountain pen she had given me had become the metronome for my days; its nib made decisions and I followed them faithfully. On Tuesday I signed my name so many times the shape of it blurred, and I had to write it once very large on an envelope not for posting just to remind my hand there was still a person with a mouth attached to the strokes. On Wednesday, in a lunch hour that refused to sit, I went to Perpetual Ink and stood among the pins and the prints and the smell of antiseptic bravery and asked the man with the long fingers whether he had ever written on himself with ordinary ink.\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d he said, as if I had asked whether he breathed. \u201cAll the time when I was a child, and then my mother would do the thing with spit on her thumb like a magician, and now when I am trying to find the edge of a thing I use the kind that will not last. Makes room for mistakes. Makes room for the days when you want to be a different speech.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me as if I was a map he had been paid to read and added, more kindly than he needed to, \u201cIt takes a certain type to put their own name on their skin and mean it. Most people only want pictures of who they\u2019ve met.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want a rope,\u201d I said, surprising myself with how easily the word came. \u201cBut not the kind people see when I go to court.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, unsurprised. \u201cThen draw it more often than you need. In pen. In pencil. Not because you don\u2019t commit\u2014but because you practice obedience to yourself.\u201d\n\nI went back to the office and drew a line on the inside of my left wrist with the fountain pen, thin as a vein, and washed it off before the meeting with Dawson. The faint ghost of it stayed as if ink had opinions. Priya saw it and did not ask me a question; she raised a single eyebrow in that very competent way she has and moved a file from my left to my right in case I forgot which hand had weather.\n\nMy father phoned me on a Thursday, which is a day he considers vulgar for telephones. He sounded like kettle steam. The fall had turned his balance into something he had to argue with in small rooms, and he hated arguing with anything that did not have a washer to fix. \u201cYour mother used to say I fell up,\u201d he said, without preamble. \u201cThis time I fell down. We must cover all directions so as not to show favoritism.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come up this weekend,\u201d I said, because sometimes obedience is not a wound.\n\nHe made a skeptical noise about my car, which is a reasonable noise to make if you have ever seen my car, and told me a story about an apprentice who had decided to keep parts in his pocket and how it went very badly for the sink. He did not ask about Iris. He will ask about Iris when he believes he will outlive the answer. I told him anyway, which is a small rebellion. I told him she made boxes of days and that her arm had learned a new alphabet and that she is a person who knows where the pit is. He grunted, which is how he metabolizes information that wants to live in his stomach instead of in his mouth, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be made a fool of,\u201d which is his way of saying be brave. I told him I would try to compromise between those two.\n\nThat night, the boy did not play because the sister had been taken to a room without windows and the nurse with the braid had asked us both, in the kindest voice I have ever heard in a corridor, to be ordinary somewhere else. Iris took me to the river which is where she takes me when she wants my mouth to be quiet. The water had decided to be opaque about everything. It wore the sky like a second story and did not regret it. She stood very still as if being in one place long enough could persuade the world to tell the truth, and I thought suddenly, and quite without permissions, that there will be a morning when she will live in another house that is not this one and I will make a cup of tea in my kitchen which will be my kitchen and maybe also not, and I will feel the shape of her not-here and it will be a furniture in the room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d she said, as if I had said any of it aloud.\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d I asked, genuinely not sure which part of me had been impolite.\n\n\u201cMake the future the villain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe future is already sorry. It doesn\u2019t need you piling on.\u201d\n\nWe stood until our knees accused us, and then we walked through streets that had decided to let their lights be kindly instead of clever. In the window of the charity shop, the SPLENDID piano had gathered two stools, perhaps by sympathy. The shop had put a sign on it that said TRY ME in a hand that refused to be humiliated by chalk. A child with a hat too large for her head sat and hammered middle C like a telegram and the woman beside her said, with a patience I want to bottle, \u201cYou can try other letters. They do exist.\u201d\n\nThere was a morning\u2014I do not know which one; it exists outside calendar\u2014in which Iris and Mina made soup with a seriousness that caused the onions to obey. I was allowed to slice bread, which is a task I can be trusted with when watched. They spoke, these two and their long history, about ingredients as if listing virtues. Thyme, Mina said, is faithfulness without aggression. Bay is patience with form. Lentils are a union. They did not talk about men and I was the better for it. When we ate, Iris\u2019s sleeve slipped and her skin did that gleam it does when recently in contact with soap and rubbing, and I watched myself not look away. I watched myself not force looking. Later, washing dishes, she pressed the heel of her hand into my lower back without thought, as if her body had learned that I was furniture that did not mind its job, and I had to go into another room for a minute and tell my chest it could stop pretending to be a cathedral.\n\nWe went to the council together, which is a sentence you do not get to say unless certain clocks have refused to be charmed. The building was exactly itself, a municipal agreement between beige and industriousness. Outside, the cigarette smoke of the worried and the routine made a slogan of the air. Inside, the woman who saw us first had a cardigan with moral opinions. She took Iris\u2019s name and spelled it three different ways until the name gave up and spelled itself. Then she said, with bureaucratic dignity, \u201cTake a seat,\u201d and we tried without grimacing the blue plastic seats that have been designed to correct posture in seven nations.\n\nThe officer who came to fetch us had hair like a promise she had kept a long time ago. She led us into a room that had forgotten its first purpose and asked Iris questions in a voice that made my own voice take its shoes off. Iris answered as if she were painting a day: not the picture of a thing, but the weather of it. She told the truth without stage directions. When asked for evidence, she laid her papers on the table like a dinner service she would let anyone eat from and also protect with her life. The officer took notes in handwriting that made me believe in legibility. When we showed her the defects in the notice, she did not perform delight or disdain; she said, \u201cThat will help,\u201d and tilted the page so the fluorescent light didn\u2019t hum over it.\n\nAre you at risk, she asked then, the most serious question in the repertoire. Iris looked at her arm and not at her face and said, \u201cNot from anyone who is in the room,\u201d and the officer did a thing I will remember\u2014a small nod that conceded a battlefield she had not been allowed to enter and respected anyway. She gave us dates and a list of acronyms that had learned to live together and pressed a card into Iris\u2019s hand as if cards could be medicine. When we stood, she said, to Iris, gently, \u201cTell us if anyone tries to make you move your own rope,\u201d and Iris said, \u201cI will tell you and I will be very boring about it,\u201d and I put the sentence in my pocket to keep.\n\nOutside, the fox crossed the car park in daylight, his indecency made daylight-proof. He looked like he had taken a class in urban policy and found it beneath him. We watched him go with a fond contempt I recommend.\n\nThe partner at the other firm called me that afternoon, his voice prepped to be collegiate. He wanted a letter that would, as he put it, \u201ccalm the waters,\u201d and his waters were two boys who had a mother in one house and a father in another and an arrangement that flattered the adult timetable and insulted the children\u2019s. I told him I would write what the facts would bear and he said the phrase \u201cagreed narrative,\u201d and I said \u201cbest interests,\u201d and we both said the word \u201camicable\u201d with sincerity and fully aware of its limits. When I put the phone down, Priya rolled her chair into my doorway and said, \u201cI am so tired of people wanting affection to be measurable,\u201d and I said, \u201cMe too,\u201d and then, because she is not wrong about ritual, we went to buy very bad coffee.\n\nThat evening Iris knocked and did not wait for me to say come in, which is not rudeness in our dialect. She stood in the hall and lifted her sleeve and I braced and did not need to be braced because there was nothing new to be seen except my own failure to be frightened. \u201cIt has stopped being a guest,\u201d she said, in that tone of wonder people have when they realize the cat has decided the house belongs to it. \u201cI thought I should tell you. It will take its shoes off without being asked now. If you want to look, look because you like the room, not because you\u2019re checking for burglars.\u201d\n\nI looked. The lines had softened in the way a line softens when it becomes a fact. The negative space did its calm work. I realized that what had scared me at the beginning was not the ink but the announcement of someone else\u2019s decision, and I liked myself for disliking myself, which is a curious but useful position from which to make changes. \u201cI like the room,\u201d I said, and her face did a very small shift that loosened the skin over her cheekbones and allowed the girl who wrote letters to boys she hadn\u2019t met to peek out and then politely retire.\n\nShe told me then about her father, not a full story, but a shelf. He had written to her when she was twenty with a letter that contained more suggestions than salutations. He had told her to \u201cpresent better,\u201d which is something men say to women when they are afraid of mirrors, and she had not spoken to him for a year and it had been both a relief and a sickness. The tattoo, she said, was not about him because he is not a pit, he is a man, and men do not get to be pits just because they are deep and loud. But the rope, she said, is about the habit of agreeing with suggestions. \u201cWhen I put my arm down on a table now,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m putting down a map where someone else might have set a meal. It helps me remember not to eat when I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n\nWe fell into the kind of quiet that is not a pause but a plan. She sat on my floor and drew lines on a napkin that became leaves that became a staircase that became nothing you could name without sounding like you had made the world on a Thursday. I wrote in my notebook in the untidy way I do when the pen wants to be quick. In between those activities we spoke about the trumpet boy\u2019s absence as if he had gone to fetch a word and would be back with it soon. We made the tea behave and then asked it to forgive us for letting it drift. We watched a program where people with aprons made cakes the size of insults and we were unkind about one of the judges and instantly remorseful, and that is, I think, the proper ratio of vice to correction.\n\nOn Saturday I went to my father\u2019s. The train practiced being late and then was late properly. The sky decided to do all its weathers in one small rectangle. My father opened the door with a dignity that had been ironed and un-ironed several times. He had put the kettle on the moment he heard my feet and it made the kitchen seem good-mannered. He showed me the bruise on his hip with an abruptness I have learned is his version of intimacy, and it was livid and purposeful, like a country he did not intend to stay in. His sink, known to me since childhood as the place where screws propose to nuts, stared at me as if to say we were both not behaving like equipment today.\n\nWe quarrelled gently in the way people do when the quarrel is an old house they have both lived in and neither want to pay council tax on anymore. He told me to move the screwdriver I had moved and I told him his lightbulbs were a hazard and he told me my hair was falling out and I told him his temper was not a tool and then we laughed and ate sandwiches that had remembered to be simple. When I left, he did a thing I did not expect: he pressed a small, surprisingly heavy parcel into my hand wrapped in paper that had once belonged to Christmas. \u201cYour mother kept this,\u201d he said, staring over my shoulder at the coats. \u201cShe told me not to give it to you until you were likely to do something unsensible with it and then take responsibility. She said I wouldn\u2019t know when that was, so I suppose you\u2019ll have to tell me if I\u2019ve got it wrong.\u201d\n\nOn the train I opened it because I am incapable of waiting when an object announces it has a story. It was a round brass pocket watch, scarred, weighty, its back engraved with a pattern that looked like frost learning to be geometry. Inside, where the mechanism\u2019s heart should tick, there was a small note in my mother\u2019s hand that said, In case you ever need to slow the afternoon. I held it and the train took a corner and in the window I saw the long, ridiculous face I have always had and the very specific angle at which it softens when presented with a kindness I do not deserve. I brought the watch to Iris and she held it like a bird and then put it to her ear and said, \u201cIt is not working,\u201d and then, \u201cNo, I am wrong, it is working in a different room.\u201d\n\nWe took it to a man near the market who fixes time for a living. His shop was a museum of measurement. He spoke very little and listened to the watch and then to my name and then to my mother\u2019s handwriting, because some trades insist on being fed with stories. \u201cIt is delicate,\u201d he said, which was his way of saying, you will have to live with how it behaves. He said he would coax it and perhaps it would do us the kindness of remembering its old job. We left it there and walked away with a piece of paper that promised nothing more than a possible reunion.\n\nThe trumpet boy returned that week with a borrowed instrument and a face that had learned the word wait. The sister had moved to a room with a garden no one is allowed in. He played in the square and the hospital pretended not to notice and the bins were very quiet. Iris stood with her sleeve down and her hands in her pocket and her mouth made a shape I hadn\u2019t seen on it yet, a shape that said I am older in this second than I was when I woke. When he finished, he did not look at us. He packed the trumpet like an apology and then, after the case had closed, turned and said, \u201cHer name is Ruth,\u201d and then left the name with us as if it were a parcel we were entrusted with on the understanding that we would not open it unless we were asked.\n\nThe landlord\u2019s agent wrote to offer us a compromise that was not a compromise but a calendar with a red square around the day he would prefer to have keys in his hand. We wrote back with politeness that had teeth. Priya took my draft and inserted three phrases that would make a county court judge feel as if he were being done the favor of remembering a precedent, and reminded the man that people are not keys and time is not his to own. Mina arrived with a coat that had outlived two governments and said, \u201cWe are going to look at a place,\u201d and Iris said, \u201cWe are not going to look at a place without Bret,\u201d and Mina said, \u201cBret is invited if he can keep his mouth from telling the room that it is a room,\u201d and I said, \u201cI will write a letter to my mouth.\u201d\n\nThe place was on a road that had mislaid its notion of itself. It had balconies too small for chairs and windows too large for secrets. The agent used the word \u201cairy\u201d as if he had personally inflated it. The kitchen admitted silently to once being something else. In the bedroom, the light had learned how to get around corners. Iris walked through it with her hands behind her back like a person observing a painting she does not need to buy to understand. She stood on the patch of floor where the boards have given up and jumped once with both feet like a child in a puddle, then looked at me to see if I would scold. I did not. Mina, at the window, said, \u201cIt is enough,\u201d which is the most dangerous sentence a human being can say.\n\nOutside, Iris said, \u201cIf this is the place, I will have to teach the walls new words,\u201d and I said, selfishly and somehow correctly, \u201cNot yet,\u201d and she said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d in a tone that made me brave again for a few hours.\n\nOn an ordinary night in the ordinary week after that, I woke at the hour all kitchens make their private noises. The house felt like a person running a hand over their hair. I went downstairs and lit one of the three candles she had given me months ago, and the light did that small discipline thing I have learned is not to be taken for granted. I took my pen and drew a rope on my wrist and did not wash it off until morning. In the quiet you tell yourself you are keeping watch over the person you intend to be, and sometimes that person turns up and sits with you and steals your tea and asks you to be less ridiculous and you agree and then fail and then agree again.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long chapter eight is supposed to be. In my life, chapters have never ended exactly where I would like them to. They end because a bus arrives or a letter does not or a person with a braid tells you to be ordinary elsewhere. They end because you fall asleep before you finish a paragraph and, in the morning, you discover the paragraph was kinder without you. There is a day coming\u2014and I say this not with dread but with the relief of being allowed to admit it\u2014when the rope we have drawn on paper and skin will be asked to hold. There is a court date printed now on one of our calendars with a sensible font. There is a boy who will teach a new window to echo. There is a watch that is either remembering or refusing. There is a father who will tell me a story about a pipe as a way of not saying he missed me. There is a woman I love who has taught me where the floor gives way and shown me how to step and permitted me to put my hand on the small of her back in the four seconds between a door and a room. If I am being dramatic, it is only because time keeps laying itself gently on brick and slate, and I keep wanting to know whether the bend of it is a kindness or a test. I have learned, at least, to light the candle and let it behave. I have learned to write we as a verb. I am learning not to move the rope. And on Thursdays, when the trumpet finds the square and the boy lifts his chin, I stand in the place where the sound will hit and I let it.The watchmaker rang in the morning when the world was trying on ash-grey and kept it, and said, in a voice that had been lifted and put down on velvet many times, that he had persuaded the mechanism to remember itself for stretches of time in the afternoon if handled with respect. He spoke of springs like small laws and cautioned me against winding as if I wanted something. When I collected it, the shop smelled of old arithmetic and lemon oil, and he laid the watch on a square of felt as if he were placing a quiet animal back into its field. On the walk home I kept opening it, not because I mistrusted its face, but because watching the seconds heave themselves forward in a disciplined way felt like a kindness I had not earned. I put it in Iris\u2019s palm and she closed her fingers around it as if she was saving a moth from our stupidity, and we held it to our ears, two schoolchildren with a contraband sea shell, listening for the hour that might slow if we asked nicely.\n\nThe letter from the council that said engage and assess was followed by another with a list that might as well have been titled How To Be Proved. We gathered the things rooms shed: receipts like small confessions, photographs that showed gutters when sunshine had expected to be the subject, the tenancy agreement with its festivals of small print, and a page Mina had found in a cupboard that confirmed the gas certificate had taken a sabbatical during a year when people were being alive anyway. Priya came by in her lunch break under the pretense of borrowing a book she had already read and put a paperclip in the correct place with a gentleness that made the clip feel forgiven. We did not feel like we were winning or losing; we felt like people carrying a pane of glass between us, and occasionally a gust made it urgent that we keep it level.\n\nThe agent discovered the word block-viewing and wanted to show five strangers how the light behaves in Iris\u2019s front room all at once on a Tuesday. I wrote a sentence that placed civility on the floor like a rug and invited him to step onto it carefully, and he wrote back with the particular version of yes that is also a sigh. When they came, the chalk arc on the hall floor improved everyone\u2019s posture. The couple who held each other's curiosity almost as well as each other's hands asked if foxes come in the garden, and Iris said, \u201cThey leave us alone if we leave them their routes,\u201d and the woman with a fringe made of deliberation said, \u201cI grew up where hedgehogs were a rumor,\u201d and looked at the fence as if it might confess. The man in the ambitious jacket touched the spines of Iris\u2019s books with the pads of two fingers and pretended not to read titles. Mina watered the plant slowly and made eye contact with the woman from the agent\u2019s office in a way that persuaded her to put the clipboard down and become human for three minutes.\n\nOn a Wednesday that was so precisely itself the church bells could have used it as a toner, Dawson brought me a family case with the email equivalent of a flourish. The line he underlined twice was \u201cunequal shares of holiday time,\u201d which is a domestic way of saying someone is smoothing their own pillow with the argument that a child should not mind the crease. I said the phrases best interests and reasonable arrangements in a tone that had straps, and spoke to a solicitor across town who hated the word contact but was prepared to use it if it got us all to tea. Afterwards, Priya leaned in my doorway and told me that the word amicable is a place two people can live if they don\u2019t mind the windows being painted shut, and I wrote that down, and later, in my notebook at home, I wrote Iris\u2019s name above it because I am running an experiment on how words behave when they are placed next to each other without explicit instructions.\n\nThe boy with the trumpet came on a Thursday with a determination that made the courtyard straighten its bin lids. The nurse with the braid was in a different hallway but had clearly told the others what kind of trouble we were, because the guard whose shoes know the length of every passage in that building nodded at us like we were volunteers who had quietly turned up again. He played not scales but a tune so ordinary it made the buildings remember their childhoods, something from a radio in someone\u2019s kitchen, long ago, that had told people who were cooking to be patient. When he finished, he pressed his fist against the closed bell like he did not trust his mouth. Later, in the square near the market where older men feed small birds with old bread and political opinions, he told us Ruth had been permitted to sit in a chair in a room with plants for twenty minutes. Iris made the noise she makes when art and medicine shake hands, and I felt the relief you feel when you find a word you had lost down the back of the day.\n\nThe court date to argue with a piece of paper about whether it was allowed to rearrange the furniture arrived in sensible type on a sheet that made us both drink water. We photocopied things that had never wanted to be photocopied and put them into a folder that had learned the stoop of heavy. The morning of, I put on a suit that likes to think well of itself and Iris put on a jumper the color of the inside of a pear and we walked down Holywell Hill together as if it were a corridor with a patient at the end. In the waiting area I opened the watch, and I swear the second hand did an unshowy thing with time that made my ribcage less of a drum. Iris traced the edge of the folder with one fingertip in a loop that repeated and repeated until the loop itself seemed to calm. We were two people trying not to hate furniture, and I say that because rooms like those require such effort to forgive.\n\nThe judge was the exact tiredness of a man who has already eaten half of everyone\u2019s lunch. He listened, which is rarer in those rooms than people suppose. The landlord\u2019s representative had a tie with ambition and a file with the look of a script that had been through too many table reads. We spoke about the gas certificate and its gap, about the deposit which had been placed in the place it should have been placed into but only after the date it should have been placed, about the letter that had learned words but not the right order. When I said \u201ccompliance is not an attitude; it is a sequence,\u201d the judge\u2019s mouth shifted by a molecule and I took it as encouragement. Iris, when asked to confirm her name and address, said both as if introducing a painting to a room with poor lighting, and when the representative for the other side tried to say she had been obstructive about viewings she said, very quietly, \u201cI have been careful with my house while it is still my house,\u201d and I watched the sentence take its shoes off and sit in the judge\u2019s good ear.\n\nWe did not win a flag; this is not that kind of book. We won time. The notice was pronounced defective in the tidy way that men say a pipe is not this pipe but perhaps the correct pipe will arrive later. The judge looked down his long bright road of cases and told the room what would happen when it happened, and the clerk in the corner typed a poem in a language that only printers read. Outside, the boy with the trumpet was not there because this was midday and not a Thursday, but the air behaved itself as if someone had just finished practicing. Mina met us on the steps because there is a clock in her that is not on anyone\u2019s wall and pressed into Iris\u2019s hand a small wrapped sweet that turned out to be parma violet because she enjoys watching modern people be confused by old sugar. We stood for a foolish minute and did not go anywhere, and then we went to a cafe where the coffee disappoints the way certain relatives do, reliably and in a tone of voice that insists you enjoy the tradition.\n\nThat evening we did something I had been putting off and did not know I had been putting off: we went to the late service on Ash Wednesday because I had never learned to be smeared by strangers and still be myself. The cathedral had the intentioned hush of a library at closing, and the sound of people deciding whether to kneel made a music all its own. The words about dust pressed a gentle hand on the brassy parts of my chest. A woman with a face that had become wiser ahead of schedule put thumb to forehead after forehead and drew commas. When she put the black on mine she did not press and she did not apologize. \u201cRemember,\u201d she said, and I did not need the object of the sentence named. Iris came behind me and received her own mark, and the charcoal line on her skin almost shook hands with the charcoal line on her skin, and the part of me that has never believed in coincidence laid down its coat and said, For tonight I will be simple.\n\nAfterwards we bought chips and ate them in paper like a sacrament that admits it is salt and grease and still dares to propose meaning. The ash stayed on our foreheads and no one on Clarence Road told on us to their gods or ours. Iris wiped hers at her door not because she was ashamed but because she wanted to see what she looked like neither marked nor unmarked. We kissed in the lee of the porch and some of the ash transferred to my cheek, and she laughed into my mouth in a low, surprised way that made me want to pay rent on the moment. When I went home I saw my face in the dark glass of my back door and the smudge there made me feel more legible.\n\nThe next day the watch stopped briefly at ten-past-three and began again at ten-past-three, and I cannot explain that any better than I can explain foxes. The fox limped again and then did not limp later, as if a second animal had borrowed his body. At work, Dawson told a story about a golf charity and used the word philanthropic with the same mouth that had asked me the previous morning to make theft sound like weather. Priya brought me a sandwich and a verdict on a new barrister who spoke like a door closing and advised we keep him away from delicate women and any men with mothers. I wrote a letter to a court about two boys whose holidays were being divided like a pie by people who had forgotten that children are not slices, and I tried to be rude on their behalf without swearing.\n\nI went into Perpetual Ink because the door was open and the smell of clean was argumentative. The man with the long fingers had not been reissued in the night as a different man; he lifted his chin in a way that said we had moved on from guessing games. I showed him my wrist with the faint ghost of yesterday\u2019s drawn line, and he nodded the way men nod at engines. \u201cPractice is half of permanence,\u201d he said, and I told him about my mother\u2019s watch and he told me about a sailor who had asked for a lighthouse so small no one could see it but him, and how you cannot rely on ink to be invisible but you can rely on skin to be stubborn. I did not book anything. I did not not book anything. He told me to rub olive oil into the place where the pen leaves its apology, and I said I would and did not lie.\n\nMy father came down to St Albans on a Saturday wearing the coat he wears when he wants strangers to consider him a man of good sense. He pretended his hip was not a man he was on speaking terms with now and asked to see the cathedral because he refuses to be outdone by my life. We stood under the nave and he cleared his throat at a particular piece of stonework with approval, which is my father\u2019s highest compliment for any object not from his trade. He did not mention the ash but he looked at me with the thin amusement of a person who has learned that his son will put marks on himself from time to time as if inviting a conversation with the air. I took him to Iris\u2019s because he is a man who will better understand art if the kettle is in the room with it, and he did the decent thing which is to make no comments for five minutes. When he did speak, he said, to Iris, \u201cYou\u2019re handy,\u201d and there is a scraping, profound respect in his voice when he names someone thus which sounds like mildness to those who don\u2019t know the register. She said, \u201cI am when watched,\u201d and he said, \u201cEveryone is better with a witness,\u201d and I felt the floor push my feet back up in case I forgot how.\n\nThey made soup without performance and he washed up without being invited because that is his profession in rooms where he does not know where anything else goes. He did not refer to the rope or the ink but his eyes knew not to ask, and Iris took her sleeve down without being instructed. When he left he shook her hand as if handing something over, and in the hall he said into his collar, \u201cShe\u2019ll do,\u201d and I said, \u201cFor me or for you,\u201d and he said, \u201cWhat difference do you think there is,\u201d and I made a noise that could serve for affection or murder depending on who transcribes it.\n\nThe landlord\u2019s man discovered a new tone on the telephone that I can only call technically conciliatory and asked whether the 10 a.m. slot on the Wednesday two weeks hence would be agreeable for a further viewing of the rooms, and I said no in a way that made him consider that other people might have mornings. The couple came back anyway at a different hour because they had asked very politely and because they had the respect for chalk that is the gateway drug to other good habits. They stood in the yet-room and said they did not know if they were allowed to love the light when it belonged to someone else. Iris said, \u201cYou can practice loving without claiming,\u201d and the man\u2019s face twitched in a way that indicated a wound and a ready bandage. Mina turned the plant a quarter turn because plants like to have their memories rearranged from time to time.\n\nOn the day that wanted to be spring and then lost its nerve, the nurse with the braid came out into the square and told us that Ruth had smiled at the boy in a way that made the boy\u2019s knees briefly forget which bend they prefer. She told him, very firmly, that he was doing a good job of letting the sound do the talking, and told us, with the same authority, that we were doing a good job of letting him. Iris folded the information into her voice and said the word Ruth as if she was wrapping her in paper that tissue knows how to be. We walked to the park and found the bench that never stops being damp and sat anyway because our trousers needed to learn. The river kept being practical. A dog found a stick and then discovered the holy truth that if you carry a stick you have a job, and its owner, who had the air of someone who had retired from something that should not be retired from, told the dog that this was enough for one morning.\n\nThe watch behaved at four, so we sat very still at four and made that into a superstition on purpose. Iris painted one of her square days with a color that was nearly not a color at all, a thin obedient wash laid over a layer that had been adventurous earlier. She annotated it with the time she felt the afternoon lean and wrote, in her precise plain hand that is sometimes braver than mine, Bret\u2019s mother\u2019s watch remembered. I wrote in my notebook without tearing the page that day, which feels like a lesson I should have learned years ago and was not offered the correct teacher.\n\nWe were not saints or lawyers in our own house every hour. There were mornings when the legal file sat under a bowl of apples and silently judged my domestic ambitions, and evenings when Iris turned a painting to the wall and then turned it back because the wall had not learned its lines yet. There were two arguments, one about the word moving, during which I performed semantics and she let me finish and then said, \u201cWe are both moving even when no one asks us to,\u201d and one about the boy\u2019s mother, whom I had judged for being late to the square without knowing whether she lives with a clock that is cruel. We forgave ourselves these indulgences by doing the boring thing immediately afterwards, which is to tell the truth to the part of ourselves that was flourishing melodrama for its own sake, and then we magneted our apologies to the fridge with the lemon from Arundel because committing them to metal made them more obedient.\n\nIn the middle of the month the council sent a woman with a lanyard and soft shoes to look at walls. She had a kindness that felt union-negotiated and made both of us sit up straighter than necessary. She measured the rooms with a laser that made a red dot skitter, and the fox watched through the window like a critic whose review we would pretend not to read. She looked at the letter from the landlord and at the timetable and at the list we had written in our own ink entitled Things We Have Already Tried, and then she looked at Iris\u2019s face like it was evidence and at my posture like I had been practicing being useful, and she said, with the finality of a recipe, \u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d and I believed her not because of the words but because of the angle of her shoulders when she stood.\n\nAt work a memo did its usual suspicion of daylight and instructed us to remind clients of the limitations of email, as if anyone had ever mistaken a chain for a river. I wrote a letter in handwriting on paper to a man who wanted his former wife to sign a document that had been drafted for the purpose of removing guilt from the story, and I put the letter in a postbox with a red mouth like a declaration and felt like I had done something medieval and potentially effective. Priya told me that if I started wearing tweed she would resign her friendship and then bought me an orange because she had noticed I had been living on the kind of lunches that make a person nervous about doors.\n\nThere was a Sunday we tried on a new church for curiosity and then ran away to the river because the sermon had more rules than weather. There was a Monday I went to my father\u2019s again and found him making an omelette with the confidence of a man who has never had an omelette judge him. He told me a story about my mother\u2019s handwriting that began at a shop counter and ended in a pocket and was, I think, about trying to keep a person near using the smallest objects available. He held the watch to his ear and said, \u201cIt sounds tired,\u201d and I said, \u201cIt has been asked to do a magnificent amount with kindness,\u201d and he said, \u201cSo have we,\u201d and if you hear more romance in that exchange than two men intended, perhaps you are not wrong.\n\nOn a wet morning that had rain with a moral agenda, the landlord\u2019s agent called to ask if the viewing could be \u201cbumped\u201d because a prospective tenant had a train that did not like him, and we said yes with the absentminded mercy of people who had given up counting how many times the same shoe had been placed on the same foot. Iris drew a chalk arc you could not see in wet hall light and we stood inside it anyway, habit asserting itself as an ethics. When they eventually came, the couple did not, and in their place was a man with a notebook who wrote measurements as if he were designing a coffin. He wanted to know if the walls were load-bearing and I told him no wall bears anything without being asked too often, and he smiled with his teeth and said that was not his experience. Mina arrived at the exact moment he attempted to touch the turned canvases and said, in a way that made him reconsider his day, \u201cThose are thinking,\u201d and he left shortly after because sometimes leaving is the correct instinct.\n\nIf you ask me what Chapter Ten is for, I will answer despite having learned that purpose hates company. It is the chapter where the watch remembers and fails and remembers again and we let that be a model. It is where the law makes a sound like a small dog turning around on a rug and lies down. It is where Iris\u2019s rope stays steady and I draw a line on my wrist and become less ashamed of washing it off in the morning in case I have a meeting. It is the chapter where a judge gives you time and you do not spend it like a fool. It is the month of ash and soup and a child who hammers middle C until the piano questions its career. It is where I stand in a square and let a boy teach me how to be present without being useful. It is where I introduce my father to my life and nobody dies in the course of the introduction and that is not nothing. It is where the council lady says We\u2019ll be in touch and I believe her because sometimes a sentence carries its own references in its pocket.\n\nOn a Thursday we did not expect to be different, the trumpet boy came, and stood without putting the case down, and said, \u201cThey let me play by her bed,\u201d and he smiled with his whole face for the first time since we met him and made a noise that was not a note and not a laugh and not a cry and meant all three. Iris reached for my wrist, not the watch one, and I let her hold it as if I belonged to the idea of not making a movement that would scare a happiness away. We stood there while he told us, in the simple order of a sixteen-year-old who has run out of adjectives, about a nurse who held a door open, and a doctor who did not say no, and a woman whose mouth did the thing mouths do when they try to find a corner, and how he had played a stupid tune from the radio and it had made the air feel like a person. We did not tell him that he had saved a day because he knew it already in the same way he will not know it for years.\n\nAt night, when the street decided to be a throat and clear itself politely, Iris drew me on her box of colors in the space that does not admit paper and I did not ask to see because I have learned to enjoy believing in things without receipts. I wound the watch with my gentlest left hand and the hand moved because it had agreed to be moved. I lit a candle and then blew it out because tonight the dark was doing a better job. We lay on the floor because the floor forgives clumsy, and when she lifted her sleeve to adjust nothing in particular I looked and liked the room and did not inventory my own fear and did not write it down. We drifted into a sleep that had corrections pencilled in the margins and left them there for morning, and the fox did his appointments like a civil servant, and somewhere a judge finished his cheese and went to bed. In the middle of the night, I woke and the watch was ticking in the other room, and for once I did not get up to check that it was not ticking without us.",

                              "content": "The first morning I saw her I was late, which was already a sign that my day would lean sideways. Bells from the cathedral came down the hill and folded over the roofs; they always do that in St Albans, as if time is a soft thing that can be laid gently on brick and slate. I left my house on Clarence Road with my scarf half-knotted and my casefile under my arm. The rain had decided to be thin and indecisive, like an argument you could walk away from without saying anything that couldn\u2019t be unsaid.\n\nNumber 12 had been empty for two months. The landlord had come and gone in a white van that smelled faintly, somehow, of turpentine whenever he left the door open. And now there were boxes stacked like pale teeth behind the thin curtains, and the front garden\u2014which could have been handsome, if anyone tried\u2014was newly raked. There she was, kneeling at the step with a hammer in one hand, coaxing the letterbox back to its hinges. I slowed down before I knew I was slowing down.\n\nShe had tied her hair up with a faded scarf, the kind with little stars picked into the weave. It made the dark of her hair look deliberate, arranged. Not pretty exactly, that\u2019s too small a word, but assembled in such a way you could believe the world had stopped for a second to get a better look. Her coat was paint-splattered, a green that had been green for some time and then had allowed itself to become a paler thing.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said without looking up, and the hammer skipped once on the brass. \u201cDo you live next door?\u201d\n\nI suppose I nodded, or said yes, or smiled. Something adequate must have happened between us because she held out two envelopes with the corner of one thumb and said, \u201cPostman is an anarchist. These say ten but may as well have been in my shoe.\u201d\n\nI took them. I do not remember the texture of the paper. This annoys me. I am a lawyer. I notice things. I\u2019m supposed to.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the street,\u201d I said, which was the polite thing. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet. Except Saturdays. And sometimes Thursdays. There\u2019s a trumpet player somewhere who has discovered Thursdays.\u201d\n\nShe smiled, and one side of her mouth decided to go higher than the other, as if the whole of her face was rehearsing asymmetries. \u201cIris,\u201d she said.\n\nHer name fell into me like a coin into a fountain, unsettling the water under the water.\n\n\u201cBret,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2014 I\u2019m on my way to court.\u201d I waved the casefile as if it were a passport.\n\n\u201cTo put the trumpet player in prison?\u201d\n\n\u201cSadly the law is ambiguous on brass.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with the hand that wasn\u2019t holding the hammer. There was a dark smear on her thumb that could have been ink or could have been something else. I have replayed that tiny gesture more times than I\u2019d care to tell you, and in each replay the smear becomes something new.\n\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d Iris said, tapping the letterbox gently, and I walked away.\n\nOn the train I stood because St Albans City at half past eight is a particular chaos, and the men who fold their newspapers into murderous little squares do not relish sharing. I rehearsed opening statements in my head, but my mind\u2014stupid, disloyal mind\u2014kept insisting on that scarf, those stars it borrowed, and the way her mouth made a decision by itself. I remembered suddenly that Saint Alban had sheltered a stranger and then put on his hood to be taken in the stranger\u2019s place. It is a story we tell tourists, and ourselves, to make our roads make sense.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Priya asked when I got to the office, because she always knows when my mind has gained a fever that my hands deny.\n\n\u201cI am making a list,\u201d I said, pulling off my coat. \u201cOf the crimes for which there ought to be swift and terrible justice. Trumpet playing is number one.\u201d\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. \u201cNumber two?\u201d\n\n\u201cBananas on toast. People who chew pens. People who borrow biros and then press down so hard you can feel the ghosts of their signatures on paper three.\u201d\n\n\u201cBret,\u201d she said, her voice making my name into a caution and an invitation. \u201cWhat\u2019s number four?\u201d\n\n\u201cMoving in next door with a hammer,\u201d I said, and immediately wished I hadn\u2019t, because Priya has a face that is all mirror. She catches you looking and gives you back to yourself in a cleaner frame.\n\nShe smiled. \u201cGlad to see the diligent people of Clarence Road continue to perform emergency repairs between raindrops.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014 it\u2019s nothing,\u201d I said. Stupidity number one of the day: saying something is nothing. Of course it was something. Even when it is nothing, it is something. We spend our lives in the porous between.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Priya said, and pressed a mug into my hand that had the law\u2019s scales on it, one chipped slightly at the bottom, making the scales tilt. \u201cBecause you\u2019re in chambers at ten, and Dawson is in a mood.\u201d\n\nDawson, senior partner at Foster & Vale, liked to think of himself as the last gentleman. He wore ties as if they had been invented for him. He had once told me, earnestly, that the law is a chorus and we are its voices. On bad days he told me that the law is a blade and we sharpen it on human behavior. He was in a mood. But that\u2019s later. THIS is earlier.\n\nThe morning court case was not glamorous. It rarely is, like most things that keep the world from tilting into ditch. Boundary disputes are a kind of silent warfare, and the war that day was two hedges wide. Mr. Pemberton had a chain-link fence and a righteous belief in his tape measure. Mrs. Elliot had a rosebush that had been there longer than her children, and not much patience left for the precise placement of pegs. I spoke, then Priya spoke, then a man with a checkered tie spoke. We introduced photographs that were mostly hedge. The judge was exquisitely bored, an art form in itself.\n\nI watched how the participants positioned themselves. Crossed arms. Thumbs hidden, thumbs visible. Eyes sliding to the door. And I thought of letterboxes being reattached, and the small sound a hammer makes when it has nearly figured out how to be useful again.\n\nAt lunch I walked down to the cathedral because I do that sometimes. There is a coolness under the stones that exists even in October, a long, old calm like a reliable friend. The martyrs, cut into panels, look down with their preset expressions, and my footsteps in that nave are always unplaceable; I hear myself coming. There is a glass window that looks like falling. There is a carved capital where regular leaves curl around a face that looks surprised to be found. A child ran through the chairs and laughed. I wanted to tell him to keep that laugh clean, that one day he would need it; I wanted to say, Don\u2019t let them parcel your laugh into documents and disclaimers.\n\nIt took me a week to ask, after that first morning, and even then it wasn\u2019t asking. It was rain. Rain has manners in this city; it makes decisions gently. The pavement shone without entirely committing to being wet. The sky hung at a reasonable height. On my step there was a parcel in beige paper that might as well have belonged to the century before ours. It had my name without my title, as if I were not an adult yet, only a person between brackets. The return address was a shop on Holywell Hill I didn\u2019t know. It contained three pale candles and a note that said, simply, \u201cFor a time that decides to behave.\u201d There was no name.\n\nSo I knocked on Iris\u2019s door because who else would know what to do with time. It took longer than I expected for her to open, and by the time she did, in bare feet and with one eyebrow arched, I had run through an impressive array of excuses in my head: I was the local parcel redistribution hub; I was a candle inspector; I was newly religious.\n\n\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d I asked, holding out the candles as if they might explode.\n\n\u201cHello again to you too,\u201d she said, and stepped back so I could see the hallway behind her. It was in demobilized boxes, those slim cardboard coffins that keep histories in polite heaps. \u201cCome in.\u201d\n\nThe air inside number 12 smelled like dust that has learned a new purpose. It smelled like the gentle surrender of wood. A plant waited on a windowsill the way a question waits in a room.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve bought three things and borrowed twenty,\u201d Iris said, taking the candles and standing them on an empty mantel as if arranging chess pieces. \u201cDo you drink tea, or are you one of those men who drink gin when the light hits the first brick?\u201d\n\n\u201cI drink tea,\u201d I said. \u201cOften as revenge.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, and I noticed there were charcoal lines on the back of her hand, faint rings tracing up towards the wrist as if she had tried on bracelets and then forgotten to wash them off. She followed my gaze and rubbed at them absentmindedly, which made them smudge and soften. \u201cWork,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI paint mostly. And some days I decide to stop painting and do something else and then I pretend that is my life now. It doesn\u2019t always work. A while I did sound. Not music.\u201d She tilted her head, listening to a nearby siren that stitched the air through Hatfield Road. \u201cSound like you listen to the shape of a room and then you make it different.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shape of a room is important,\u201d I said. \u201cI am suddenly alert to the shape of rooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, Bret-not-a-title,\u201d she said, looking at the note I had brought in with the candles. \u201cWould you like a ridiculous biscuit? I have the ones that pretend to be digestives but are actually sugar.\u201d\n\nI took a biscuit mostly because it would be impolite not to, and partly because there is a kind of hunger that\u2019s not about food at all, and sometimes you have to give it something to hold in its fist.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your work?\u201d she asked, sitting on the floor like a person who prefers the first level of things. There was a micro-scar at the corner of her thumb that shone. The room rustled like a coat dropped on a chair.\n\n\u201cLaw,\u201d I said, and her face made that tiny adjustment people\u2019s faces make. \u201cI know. It is not like the shows. The parts that are like the shows are the parts you should worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t watch the shows,\u201d she said. \u201cI listen to people argue in supermarkets and decide who would win in case law. It\u2019s more fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI represent hedges,\u201d I said, and told her about Mr. Pemberton and Mrs. Elliot in a voice that made it sound nicer than it was. She laughed when she should. Then she told me about painting the river near Verulamium Park too fast, how she had to let the geese be smears because that day they refused to behave like geese. Her voice had a way of patting its children, a contained tenderness that did not spill unless she allowed it.\n\n\u201cThank you for the candles,\u201d I said when I remembered the manners I had put in my pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll save them for when time goes crooked.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo,\u201d she said. \u201cI think time is like a poorly trained dog. It needs to be told what to fetch.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it know how to drop it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you trade it for something good. A walk. An apple. A confession.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you collect confessions?\u201d I asked, and she smiled like someone who has been asked the right question by accident. She did not answer me then, but moved to the window and wiped a circle on the glass with the cuff of her sleeve.\n\n\u201cYou can see the cathedral from here in winter,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the trees get shy. I like it. The way the city can\u2019t help looking at itself.\u201d\n\nWe stood like that for a minute, my mug cooling, her sock a little damp where she had stepped into a quick puddle on the kitchen tile. The doorbell startled us both. She went and came back with a small package carefully wrapped in brown paper and string, like something that arrived by mistake from a different story about a different century. She didn\u2019t open it immediately, and I wanted to ask her what it was, as if that would be a normal thing for a neighbor to do.\n\n\u201cI should let you get back to your life,\u201d I said, because you are supposed to leave before the welcome\u2019s elastic snaps.\n\nShe walked me to the door and, in that small space between hallway and weather, she looked as if she would say something that would scoop me a little closer, but then didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter that there were small things. The rain went away and returned as if it had forgotten its keys. My mother phoned me on Sundays and asked me if I was eating, which is a code mothers use to ask if you are lonely. Kit at work, who has a face like bread\u2014plain and good and necessary\u2014brought in a Tupperware of something he called lasagna but which had not so much layered as tumbled. Priya won a small case against a large man and smiled in a way that made you believe in justice again for a few hours. I bought a new pen and wrote my name with it too many times on a spare sheet because the first mark of ink is a ceremony if you let it be.\n\nSometimes, coming home, I would hear Iris singing behind her door, but never the whole of a song; only the part that understood what it was for. Sometimes an older woman came to see her, carrying a shopping bag full of lemons and herbs. They would talk on the step for a while and then one of them would laugh quietly, and the other would correct that laugh gently, as if not wanting to wake anyone. I never learned her name.\n\nWhen the weather grew cooler she hung three small canvases on the wall opposite her couch and then decided she didn\u2019t like them and turned them to face the plaster. This made the room look like it was being punished, and I had to resist an impulse to knock again and ask the paintings what they had done.\n\nI bring you these things not to pad the tale but because if you don\u2019t have the small things, you don\u2019t have the big thing either. I have learned this both by watching the law work and by watching it not.\n\nWe built a conversation across our shared fence, in increments. She would lean over to pull a weed out from between the paving stones and say, \u201cIs this a weed?\u201d And I would say, \u201cEverything is a weed if you give it a different name.\u201d I\u2019d bring in the bin and she would stand on her step and ask, \u201cDoes the bin always do that? Sulk?\u201d We spoke about the fox who lived under the car on the corner and how he looked like a gentleman who had decided to be wild. We spoke about the crows and how they patrolled the streets as if we were the guests. Sometimes we didn\u2019t speak; we stretched silence between us like a clean sheet and let the air straighten it.\n\nOnce, I was balancing a bag of potatoes and a disaster of oranges in my arms and the bottom of the bag parted company with the rest of the bag on my path. The oranges rolled, a jail break. Iris stepped out and caught two with the kind of reflex that makes you think of goalkeepers and doctors.\n\n\u201cGravity likes me,\u201d she said, handing them back. \u201cOr hates me. We\u2019re in a long-distance relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, bending and scooping and laughing more than the moment deserved, because laughter is a solvent and I needed something to pour over the day. She handed me the last orange and that was when I saw the inside of her wrist carefully inked with a pencil line, very fine, that traced from the base of her palm to the thin bones like a road on a map. She saw me see it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for later,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI draw them first to see if they belong. Sometimes they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cA sketch for a\u2014\u201d I said, and stopped because I did not want to be the kind of man who names things that are not his.\n\n\u201cFor a thing,\u201d she said, and turned her hand so the rain could erase it more quickly.\n\n\u201cDo you\u2014 do you have many?\u201d I ask her, and immediately felt foolish because my skin was a landscape of precisely nothing, save a scar from a bicycle accident when I was nine and a faint ghost of a bee sting I still insist I remember.\n\n\u201cSome,\u201d she said. \u201cMostly hidden. It feels... like carrying a story on the outside for once.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds right,\u201d I said, because it did. The law is a way of carrying a story on the outside of your head until someone agrees with you.\n\nWe met in the grocery on Victoria Street and pretended to be surprised. We met on the Alban Way and pretended not to be winded. We met under the same awning during a sudden, clean rain that lasted exactly three minutes, and we did not pretend anything. We shared the weather like a secret.\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel,\u201d she said one Thursday when the trumpet player was briefly merciful, \u201clike your name is a coat someone else bought for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly all the time,\u201d I said.\n\nShe twitched her mouth in that one-sided way. \u201cMy mother wanted to call me Iris because she liked the idea of seeing,\u201d she said. \u201cMy father told her she liked the idea of drinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe did both,\u201d Iris said, and then laughed in a way that said this wasn\u2019t a joke but we were allowed to place it in the shelf where jokes live.\n\nWe told each other our small facts. I told her how my father taught me to fix a leaky tap in a kitchen that is no longer a kitchen and how the sound of a slow drip can still hijack my whole chest. She told me about a job she had in a shop that sold only lights, and the day the lights all went out in a storm, and how customers came in anyway to stand among the dark lamps as if they were in a forest that had decided to sit down. I told her how, when I was nine, my schoolteacher Mrs. Marchant sent home a note I kept folded in a book for years, about how neat my handwriting was. She told me how she once gave a man a painting in exchange for a winter coat and never regretted that currency.\n\n\u201cDoes the law move you?\u201d she asked me one evening when the sky folded itself into a deeper blue and stayed, like a curtain that had learned manners.\n\n\u201cNot as much as the people inside it do,\u201d I said, and meant several things at once. I am always meaning several things at once. It is a curse of people who have learned to speak through drafts.\n\n\u201cThe river moved me today,\u201d she said from her step. \u201cIt decided to be metal in the morning and cloth by afternoon. I would like to be as unapologetic as a river when I grow up.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d\n\nThat week I kept noticing marks. On bus shelters. On people\u2019s arms. On the side of the fishmonger\u2019s van where someone had written love with one of the letters scratched out so you had to complete it with your mind. On the floor at court where tape marks drew borders for chairs that could not remember where to stand. The city seemed to be labeling itself for me, and I wasn\u2019t sure whether to be comforted or suspected. Every phone call, every file, I wanted to write a small note in the margin and say, Look here, a sign. Look here, a thing that means more than it means.\n\nIt was almost November when Priya asked me to come to a gallery on a back street near the Clock Tower where someone she knew had hung photographs of windows. \u201cYou\u2019ll hate it,\u201d she said happily. \u201cBut in a way you\u2019ll enjoy hating it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a neighbor,\u201d I said, because we do this, we introduce new people into our old sentences.\n\n\u201cYou do,\u201d she said, with interest but not surprise. \u201cDo you like this neighbor?\u201d\n\nI sifted through shapes of words, like coins in the pocket of someone else\u2019s trousers. \u201cI like how she makes me notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cDangerous,\u201d Priya said. \u201cNoticing leads to action. Or terrible poetry.\u201d\n\nWe went anyway, and my suit felt wrong among all that art. The photographs were what she had said they would be: windows, neat in a grid, each with a slight variation, a plant or a curtain or a face you could not be sure you really saw. I stood there and did my duty of standing and thinking empathetic thoughts about detail. Iris arrived ten minutes in. She had changed her scarf; this one had little white birds along the edge that looked like commas that had learned to fly. She kissed me on the cheek like we had been doing it for years. \u201cYou hate it?\u201d she asked, and I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nWe walked out and down past a pub that was never sure what it was called and a charity shop that had more chairs than anyone could reasonably need. We went into a coffee place where the staff had names like Arlo and Kit and Thea, and they used mint in ways that made me distrust mint. We sat. She drew at the edge of a paper napkin, small arcs that intersected and then turned into something else. She did not notice she was doing it. The ink stained her index finger like a small surrender.\n\n\u201cTell me what case you\u2019re carrying in your pocket like a stone,\u201d she said, because by then she had learned me.\n\n\u201cA girl,\u201d I said. \u201cYoung. Sixteen. She took her mother\u2019s car and went to Southend and then didn\u2019t go back home exactly, and now everyone is trying to decide if she has done something wrong or just done something.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has done something,\u201d I said. \u201cThings are not always a crime when adults feel hurt. But we\u2019re good at labelling them that way, because it\u2019s easier to make a person a file than to make them a situation.\u201d\n\nIris looked at me with a seriousness that held my face still. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a situation?\u201d she asked, and all the ordinary noise of the coffee shop bled into a single held note.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, because lying is a talent of mine that I decided not to use right then. \u201cBut I mean that as a compliment. A situation means there is time involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like time,\u201d she said, and then, without seeming to move at all, her hand was on my wrist, light, like the way a moth would be if a moth had decided to be gentle. She smiled and then didn\u2019t.\n\nI walked home that evening and the leaves had turned the color of tea when you forget the bag. I wanted to run, not because anything was chasing me, but because sometimes your bones want to arrive before your skin does. Iris was not home. A note on her door said, Back in an hour, with a drawing of a small fish in the corner, smiling like someone who knows better than to smile.\n\nI put the kettle on. I sat at my table, which is not really mine, which belonged to my father for a long time and has the marks to prove it, and then belonged to a man called Tom who went to Spain with someone he met on the train, and was given to me as a kindness. I took out a sheet of paper and wrote, Dear Iris, and then stopped, because where do you put the rest of the sentence. I leaned my head against the cool glass of my back door and watched the fox take his route between compost bins like a commuter with better posture.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell when I decided to love her. That\u2019s not false modesty. Some decisions are a clean click. Others are a vandalism of will, unreadable until afterwards. It might have been when I first saw her with the hammer, making repairs to her world in the rain, because I have always liked people who make repairs. It might have been in the coffee shop, when her hand held me like a promise she didn\u2019t have to redeem. It might have been when she told me about the winter coat, and navigated generosity with a map that felt known to my bones. It might have been the evening she stood in her doorway and said, \u201cDo you wish the law was sometimes a person so you could forgive it?\u201d and I laughed then because I wanted to kiss her.\n\nIn the morning I woke early and walked down to Verulamium Park. The water made that practicing-violins sound it makes when it tries to get your name right. Children in small uniforms marched in pairs. A woman threw bread at a loaf of ducks who had no intention of being polite about it. I thought about the fact that some of my happiest moments in recent months had happened within ten meters of a fence.\n\nWhen I came back she was on her step, sitting cross-legged with a small mirror propped inside the door. She held a black pen\u2014the kind with a precise, aggressive nib\u2014and drew a line along the outer edge of her forearm, slow, like someone putting a road where there had never been one. She did not look up when I approached, and this seemed to me, absurdly, like a kind of trust. At the edge of the line she paused and glanced over, and the glance did everything a conversation attempts in paragraphs.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you ever feel like drawing on yourself to know where you are?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d I said, and then caught myself and turned that admission into a shrug. \u201cI write on case files instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cUseful,\u201d she said, returning to the mirror, and I stood there for a moment, feeling my life press its face to the window and exhale.\n\nYou will think I forget other people existed, but I assure you they still did. The firm continued to be exactly itself. Dawson came into a meeting with a coat that knew it was expensive and a manner that had tested well in focus groups. He asked me to draft a letter to a client whose money had gone missing the way sometimes money takes a walk on a hot day. Priya told me she had dreamed of her grandmother folding sheets in an endless hotel that had no rooms. The trumpet played on Thursday like a small civil war and the crows voted with their wings to side with whoever paid attention.\n\nIt was late Friday when Iris knocked on my door for the first time. I had been halfway through a proper dinner and twenty-eight percent of the way through a sad one. I opened to find her with rain on her curls and a look like a petition.\n\n\u201cElectricity died,\u201d she said. \u201cIt tried for a while to be both off and on and then decided to commit. I\u2019m not frightened,\u201d she added quickly, and then rolled her eyes at herself \\\u2014 as if the word frightened was a dress that did not fit. \u201cBut it will be a while and my room looks like a shrug. Could I exist near you for a while?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, which was easier to say than the other thing I was considering saying, which was Stay, but no one belongs to anyone and I am trying to be good at that. I made tea with the ceremony I make tea with when someone watches me. Iris sat at my table and curled the sleeve of her coin-colored jumper over her hands, and I found I was talking for both of us, because sometimes you have to pour words into the room so it doesn\u2019t feel like the roof will come down. I told her about the first case I lost, and how I went home and ironed my shirts like I was punishing cotton. She told me about a dog she once found in Wales, temporary and soft, who followed her for a day and then made its own decision about belonging.\n\nWhen it was time for her to go, she stood in my hall and we looked at our shoes like traitors. I saw, briefly, a pattern on her collarbone, ink or shadow or imagination, a geometry that implied decision. She saw me see, and the room leaned a bit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m marking again,\u201d she said, almost apologetically. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll keep it. There\u2019s a shop down near London Road I go to sometimes, to ask questions. Perpetual Ink. Terrible name.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerpetual,\u201d I said, as if trying the word for weather. \u201cWhere does the name stop being a promise and become a threat?\u201d\n\nShe smiled in the way that meant she liked the question. \u201cI suppose we all decide that line at different times,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing the world is mostly indecisive.\u201d\n\nWe said goodnight in the manner of people who have practiced alone and now find real circumstances harder. I closed my door and leaned my head against it and laughed softly like someone who has just tasted something they did not know they had been hungry for.\n\nBy then I had begun to keep a little notebook, a cheap one you can buy at the station. I told myself it was for work and then we both knew it was not. I wrote down groundless things that felt like ground. The time the bells rang not at the hour but some strange time in between and I swore the birds shifted by an invisible command. The way Mrs. Pell, who runs the shop at the corner, says my name like a question and then immediately answers it herself. The way my own name looks when written quickly, how the letters lean towards each other like conspirators. Iris\u2019s lines on her skin. Iris\u2019s hand holding a spoon. Iris\u2019s anger when the man on the bus callously folded his newspaper and hit a woman\u2019s shoulder with it and did not apologize. I had not known anger could look beautiful and I do not know if I approve of that.\n\nYou will ask me what I wanted. We are always asking ourselves that quietly in the backs of rooms while someone tells a story and arrives at the part where the wanting is the point. I wanted what I always want: to move across a room without the room changing itself to suit or to punish me. To sit with a person without parts of me turning their faces to the wall because they do not wish to be seen. To be looked at by a person who knows where my edges are and does not try to move them with their hands. To drink tea that does not cool quickly. To sleep without the night asking me for identification. To read a book and not disassemble it while I\u2019m reading it, because not everything is work. To have the law in the room but sitting softly on the floor, not in my lap.\n\nIn December the market put up its lights and the stalls sold cinnamon and somehow that smell became the air for three weeks. I bought Iris a book because I am dull that way, but the book was illustrations of medieval animals that have never existed, and I wrote in the front: For when you need a creature that cannot be categorized. She opened it and ran her finger over a drawing of a hare with antlers, and then shut it quickly as if she were worried the hare would leave.\n\n\u201cFor you,\u201d she said, and handed me a fountain pen in a soft, severe case. \u201cI watched a video of a man in Japan making it and I knew you would be unbearable with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said, and then, in an act of uncharacteristic bravery, I took the lid off and wrote her name on the top page of my notebook so deliberately that my hand trembled.\n\nWe stood on the pavement, two people with small, expensive objects, snow plotting quietly above us without following through. I wanted to kiss the corner of her mouth, where decisions seemed to be made. I wanted to do it in front of the whole of Clarence Road and the fox and Mrs. Pell and the trumpet player. I did not. I do not know if that was courage or cowardice. The line between wind and weather is an argument the sky gets to win.\n\nThere was a night, late, when I woke from a dream where my father was teaching me again how to fix a leak and I was breaking everything I touched. The house made the night noises it keeps in a cupboard. I went to the window and saw a light on in Iris\u2019s front room, a warm hold of light, and a moving shape, her. She was pacing, not in distress exactly, but like someone measuring the room to find its heart. She raised her arms and let them fall, repeated it three times, then stood very still. I stood at my pane of glass like a child at a museum, and then felt ashamed of the tiny distance. I made tea I didn\u2019t drink and considered sending her a message I didn\u2019t send. There is a way to love that feels like you are keeping watch, and a way to love that feels like you are standing guard against yourself.\n\nThe next day she knocked and said, \u201cI need a witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have only the law,\u201d I said, trying to make a joke as a shield.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a show. Small. Here. In the house. People in rooms looking at things on walls and pretending the rooms don\u2019t matter. You\u2019ll pretend with them. But I need you to look before they do, so the walls know they are going to be looked at.\u201d\n\nI nodded. I did not understand the job but I was ready to be asked. She moved through her rooms with the careful decisiveness of a sculptor of air. The canvases were new to me, and not. A river that refused to be only water; a forest that you could feel breathing. A window the exact blue the evening decides to be when it is not yet ready for black. A body\u2014hers?\u2014only partial, a collarbone that made me want to forgive everything. She watched me watch them. My watching did a thing to her face I could not have anticipated: it loosened something that had been clamped for years. I said very little. For once, this seemed the correct call.\n\nThe night of the show the street brought its eyes and its coats. The trumpet player was invited and did not play, which felt like a small miracle we were not worthy of. Priya came, with a green scarf that made even her sarcasm seem benevolent. Dawson came and looked at everything with duty and left with relief. People murmured the way they do when they\u2019re translating their feelings into words they hope will be fashionable later. And Iris stood still and did not defend herself. She did not explain. In that room the law was, for a few hours, a small nice dog asleep on the rug.\n\nAfter they left we sat on the floor and ate toast and she put her head on my knee very briefly and then immediately apologized for the entire concept of knees. I put my hand very near her hair and then remembered to move my hand and did. She laughed in her throat and did a small shiver.\n\n\u201cIf I ever disappear, will you have to come find me?\u201d she asked, watching the last of the guests negotiate themselves out the front door.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt will be tedious for both of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI intend to carry a map on my skin,\u201d she said, and then sat up. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about doing a bigger one. Not a flower, not something with names. Something that will make me remember a time I need to remember. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know if it will scare the people who get scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cScaring the right people is a hobby you could list on forms,\u201d I said. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t scare yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said, and then made a face, because we had both caught the lie mid-jump. \u201cAll right. I do. But I still want it.\u201d\n\nShe looked at my face the way the city looks at the cathedral when the trees go shy. \u201cWould you come with me? When I go. Just to walk me there. Just so that when I step out again there is a person who remembers the before.\u201d\n\nI agreed, without understanding that we were going somewhere I would no longer be able to follow. I said yes because my mouth has learned to say yes faster than my nervous system can catch it and negotiate.\n\nYou will want, later, to measure the distance between this moment and another, much sharper one, with a ruler. You will want steps to count. But there is a point at which counting is not the equal of knowing. You put your hand on a door. You open it. The room beyond is always larger than the hinges imply. And even here, even right now, when I tell you that I loved a way to exit and a way to return, I know you will look at me and say that love is a name only, a coat you put on because they gave it to you.\n\nI am putting on the coat.\n\nI am walking out of my house into the kind of January light that pretends to be polite. Iris is on her step with her hands in her pockets, making her shoulders small, and she gives me that look I associate with buses that are just about to arrive. We walk down Holywell Hill, past the window where the hare with antlers looks out, past the shop that sells bulbs caged in delicate wire like little moons they might keep, past a woman with a pink hat who says sorry and does not look sorry. The city bends itself around us.\n\n\u201cAre you frightened?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cI am hospitable,\u201d she says. \u201cI am making tea for the fear in my chest and asking it to sit properly while we discuss terms.\u201d\n\nPerpetual Ink, terrible name, is painted black in a way that suggests an argument with color. There are prints on the walls, and a man with long fingers and eyes that look two seconds ahead greets us and says Iris like a secret. She hands him a drawing I have only seen as a blur when she slid it into her pocket by my front door. He nods like a person who has agreed in advance to very little and now finds himself agreeing to more. \u201cYou sure?\u201d he asks. \u201cBecause this is a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Iris says.\n\nI wait in the outer room among the magazines that all smell like they were left in the same sun. A woman is talking to her friend about how she hopes her mother will understand. A boy with a scar that makes his eyebrow look impatient is pretending not to be frightened. I pick up a magazine about ink like it is a book about travel and I am going to a country I will not be good at. The music is patient and bass-heavy; it sits in the bones more than the air. Iris disappears behind the curtain.\n\nThree minutes later she reappears and makes a face that means I will be sitting there a while. I do. I think about letters. I think about Saint Alban and a hood. I think about the word permanent and want to argue with it. I write down in my notebook the color of the morning. I write down the exact pattern of the tiles under my feet. My mind tries to be a camera. My mind fails.\n\nAfter, when she comes out, when she is holding her arm like a person holds something they do not yet know how to name, she is not the same, and I do not mean the ink. She is like a room that has had its furniture quietly rearranged so that your path through it is new. She does not look at me at first. She looks at the window where the street is still hard and ordinary, where the buses still insist, where the woman in the pink hat walks past and is still not sorry.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask, stupidly, because my mouth asks what is in front of it.\n\n\u201cI made a decision,\u201d she says, and the way she says decision makes me wonder how many other decisions have sat in her chest like small, stubborn animals.\n\n\u201cCan I see?\u201d I ask, and she lets me.\n\nI look. I wish now I had not, which is not to say I blame the looking. Some images go into you clean and set up a room. Others arrive with their own weather. This one wasn\u2019t a flower or a map. It wasn\u2019t a word. It wasn\u2019t a bird taking off or an anchor deciding to give up. It was\u2014 I should not try to describe it and I will anyway, because what else is there to do. It was a shape I recognized from nowhere and everywhere, like a sickness a city gets in winter on all its windows. It ran up her forearm like a vine that had learned geometry, and at its center there was a negative space, an absence, that pulled the eye and held it. It was exquisitely done. It was beautiful. It was a mark that said: Now I have joined myself.\n\nI did not say any of that. I said nothing. I sat with my mouth closed while the ink dried and my pulse went into the wrong room. She covered it again, tucked her hand into her pocket, and we walked out together, and the air was the same and not. The sky decided to make weather after all, a little rain that did not ask permission.\n\nOn the walk home she told me about the buzzing in her bones and about how the man with the long fingers had said, You\u2019ll need to sit with it, like it was a guest she would have to entertain for a while. I nodded and made small noises of agreement. Inside, something was taking inventory. I cannot tell you why my body voted no on a thing that made her say yes; the reasons we give ourselves later are not the reasons at the time. But my blood had a meeting. My skin tried to move away from itself. I thought absurdly of my neat handwriting in Mrs. Marchant\u2019s class, of how pleased she was, and felt the sharp and ridiculous grief of someone who misses a teacher who taught him to not make a mess.\n\nWe reached our doors. She turned to me and showed me the corner of it again as if to say, This is the story, and I must love it now for both of us. I smiled then, because I am an expert at smiling when the room expects it. I said, \u201cIt suits you,\u201d which is true and was a kindness and also a sentence that sits next to a different sentence I did not say, which is that it did not suit me at all.\n\nI went into my house and put the kettle on and did not make tea. I sat at the table with the pen she had given me and did not write. There are moments when you are pulled to the edge of your own patience with yourself and you think, either I will be someone else now, or I will have to pretend to be more of myself than is reasonable. It is not noble. It is barely tolerable.\n\nThat night I dreamed of a room with no corners and woke knowing exactly how many corners my room has. The fox screamed the way foxes do, which is a horror made animal, and somewhere a glass fell in someone\u2019s kitchen and did not break. I lay there and listened to the world perform its small theater, and thought: she has done a thing that will not be undone.\n\nIn the morning, as if to reassure myself, I ironed a shirt with such precision it felt violent. I walked to the office with the exact route I always take, counting steps at the parts where I know the cracks. I sat at my desk and put my pen on the paper and did not use it. Priya looked at me and then looked away tactfully; know this about her, she will always give you the privacy to fail. Dawson entered and asked if anyone had seen the file for Mr. Langley and I said, Absent, like I was taking attendance. Everything was the same and not.\n\nI did not see Iris that day. Or the next. I thought of her as a page turned and me as a reader who is not ready, and then corrected myself, because I am not allowed this dramatics. I walked home the long way once, detouring through the market and then the car park, which is to say I pretended to have a reason to be wholly elsewhere. My chest did an excellent imitation of carrying something heavy.\n\nWhen I saw her again, three days later, she was talking with Mrs. Pell on the pavement about a plant that had decided to die and I had the urge to ask the plant for help. I am a rational person. You would not know it now. She saw me, and waved, and that wave did a very specific thing to the inside of my mouth that made me feel I had been caught; she came nearer.\n\n\u201cYou look like someone,\u201d she said, \u201cwho has been in a room with a very smart child and a very broken kettle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kettle is obviously an allegory,\u201d I said, \u201cand the child is time.\u201d\n\nShe smiled and touched my sleeve with one finger, very gently, as if testing whether the cloth had made up its mind. \u201cCome over?\u201d she asked. \u201cI want to show you something, and I promise it isn\u2019t my arm again.\u201d\n\nI went. Of course I went. We are all, in the end, complicit in ourselves. The room was arranged differently, the paintings shifted to make room for a thing that wasn\u2019t there. On the couch was a stack of letters tied with string like something people do in films. She untied them and let them spill and one fell to the ground and I saw my name. Not my name. The name Bret in someone else\u2019s hand, written years ago, a pen pressing down too hard, the way we write when we are nervous or sixteen. She picked it up and pressed it into my hand.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I asked, and she put her hair behind her ear in the way I have told you before and I will tell you again and again because you must understand this in order to forgive me.\n\n\u201cA letter I wrote when I was a person who put all the words in the world in bad places,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to read it. I am not one of those people who makes other people read old maps. I only want you to know there was a map.\u201d\n\nI held the paper as if it would bite. I did not read it. I did not ask her to explain. I was gentle and normal and precise. We had tea and did not make the tea perform. We left the letters like a mess on the couch because sometimes you have to leave a mess to convince yourself you can be a person who owns things.\n\nLater that evening, the trumpet played and we could hear it through our walls at the exact same angle. Iris laughed and leaned her head back and when she did, the collar of her shirt slipped and I saw again the edge of the thing on her skin, and I felt a movement in me that you would be right to call fear, though at the time I dressed it more politely. It sat with me at my table later as if it had been invited. It went to bed and got into my side and waited. It is still here, sometimes, when the bells roll down the hill and the city tells itself a story about a man who put on someone else\u2019s hood and decided that meant something. I want it to mean something. I want everything to mean something. I want that to be allowed.\n\nThat night I took the three candles out of their paper and set them on my mantel. I lit one. It burned like it had been practicing. I sat in the chair that has a hollow where I always sit, and I watched the light do its slow work, and I put my hand out into it and then took it back. Outside, the fox made a sound like a hinge. The trumpet paused as if it had been told a secret. The candle burned down to the point where you could blow it out and leave the night to finish the sentence. I did not blow it out. I let it decide. I thought, not for the first time, that a person\u2019s life is a story they tell to the person they hope to be, and that the person who listens is always a liar. I thought, in the quiet, that I had been given an invitation. I thought, in the quiet that is never quiet enough, that I was not ready. I thought, and I thought, and the candle, polite and determined, did what it had always been made to do.",

Breath hung in front of faces like trial balloons, and the light decided to behave the way light behaves when it has been given rules and is trying not to touch anything it shouldn\u2019t. I left my house early because sleep had been polite and brief; it had set me at the edge of the bed at five and said, Good luck with your day, and I had shook its hand and gone downstairs out of habit. The fox had not yet finished his rounds and looked at me as if to say we were both too eager. The candle I had allowed to complete itself had left a small crater of wax like the map of a country that used to exist. I tidied around it with a care that would have embarrassed me if anyone had been present, because it felt like tidying around a decision.\n\nAt the cathedral a man with a broom swept stone in wide arcs that made a sound like the beginning of rain. The nave was empty the way a room is empty when it is waiting to be good, which is different than the way it is empty after everyone has gone home. A notice near the door said Candlemas in a script that tried to be plain and almost was. I stood in the cool and said my secular prayers, which are mostly just names of people I hope continue to exist. In a side chapel a woman with a coat sensible enough to survive any age lit a thin candle and the flame made a small, competent vow. I did not light one. I did not feel worthy of adding to the arithmetic when I had candles at home that asked their own questions.\n\nOn my way back, Iris was standing in the small bay window like someone who had been arranged there by a considerate director. The aftermath of ink had made a slight discipline of the way she held her arm, a choreography that asked for space between fabric and skin. She saw me and waved with the other hand, and I did a complicated gesture with my scarf as if my scarf were a person with feelings. She opened her door before I was quite at mine, and the air between the two houses did a little contraction that my body noticed before my head did.\n\n\u201cHow is your guest?\u201d I asked, because that seemed safer than asking how she was, which is sometimes an ambush disguised as care.\n\n\u201cHe is quiet and imperious and would like to be introduced to everyone as soon as possible so he can make decisions,\u201d she said, smiling with only the middle of her mouth, and I saw the shine of the dressing under her sleeve and tried not to fall in love with the fact of care. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not fine. It\u2019s like the weather having an opinion about my arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d I said, and then immediately corrected, because this is my specialty, repairing sentences as they leave my mouth. \u201cNot good, but\u2026 you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d she said, and for a brief moment the most ordinary word we own sounded like a clean instrument.\n\nAt work, Priya looked at my face in the way a doctor looks at the color of a person\u2019s nails, and I made a noise that pretended to be the sound competent men make when they are asked to lift piano lids. She handed me coffee and a stack of files and said, \u201cYou\u2019re early, which means the world is either ending or beginning. We have Langley at eleven, and the girl\u2019s review has been moved to this afternoon if the magistrate\u2019s stomach can bear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe magistrate\u2019s stomach,\u201d I said, trying on a grin like a tie, \u201chas survived lunches that would have felled a younger man.\u201d\n\nShe tilted her head and did not pursue the joke, and I appreciated her silence the way you appreciate a well-timed hand on your shoulder that does not linger. The case files lay there in their elastic bands like sandwiches wrapped too tightly, and I imagined unwrapping them and finding different fillings than the ones the law allows. Mr. Langley\u2019s documents had that very specific smell of paper that has decided to be important and is only half right about it. The money that takes a walk on a hot day had not yet decided to come home, and Dawson had written in his neat slanted script the kind of sentence that suggests more is known than can be said aloud. It looked like the beginning of a short, unsatisfactory poem.\n\nAt eleven, Dawson went first because that is what he does, and the room rearranged itself around his voice as if it had practice. We discussed the numbers in ways numbers deserve to be discussed, which is to say clearly and with the possibility of being wrong. Dawson suggested phrasing in the letter to Mr. Langley that would make a person feel seen and misdirected at the same time, which is a talent I do not enjoy in other people but admire when the stakes are large. I kept looking at the corner of my own notepaper where I had written Iris\u2019s name in the pen she had given me and had almost written it too large. I pressed the edge of the nib into the paper until the impression showed on the desk through the sheet and then felt a ridiculous flare of shame, as if I had broken something that mattered to someone else. Dawson was describing an escrow that had changed shape when I thought, abruptly, that I did not know what shape I was, and then I remembered I had eaten half a banana in the kitchen and had not finished it, which is the kind of chaos my mind prefers when real chaos is present.\n\nAfter lunch, the girl sat on the bench with her hands clasped in that performance of innocence that teenagers do when innocence is a negotiation with theatre. She was smaller than the file implied. Her mother sat behind her with her mouth pursed into an emblem, and a man whose job it is to make options narrower than they start out being shifted papers as if he were preparing to perform surgery on a very stubborn organ. I spoke calmly because if you do not give people calm at these moments you give them nothing.\n\n\u201cShe went,\u201d I said to the room softly, \u201cto the edge of a place and measured herself against it. She was wrong to take property, but she was not wrong to take herself to a shoreline and see what the air does there. We make the mistake, often, of treating teenage navigation as crime when it is just navigation with poor signage.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate looked at me from behind a pair of glasses that have seen many navigations, and his mouth did a small thing, and I knew I had the room for a minute. The girl did not look at me, because to look at me would have been to accept an adult handand she was not ready to be seen by anyone who did not know her washing powder. I saw the mother\u2019s chin tremble and then stop, like a small animal that has decided against bolting. We got what we needed, which is to say a little more time and a little less punishment, and I carried that win like a pebble I placed carefully on a shelf.\n\nOn my way back to Clarence Road the air had decided to be kind about the cold. The woman with the pink hat was arguing with a man about whether the milk was off, and the argument had in it the entire skeleton of a marriage I did not want to think about. Outside the greengrocer, the older woman with the herbs stood with a bag of parsley that had not been given the choice but to be beautiful. She saw me and did that particular British thing where you do not greet someone until they are exactly within greeting distance, and then greet them as if greeting had been inevitable all along.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Bret,\u201d she said, making my name sound like something she would keep safe in a drawer because she had always collected useful things. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you weighing oranges like you\u2019re measuring truth. I\u2019m Mina. Sometimes I make Iris eat soup. It is work, but I am committed to my craft.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to anyone who can persuade someone to eat soup,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is the only honest food.\u201d\n\nShe smiled and handed me the parsley as if I had earned it. \u201cYou are a talker,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you have the look of someone practicing not talking. You know of her letters?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw them,\u201d I said, and then stopped because it sounded like a confession and she did not need my confessions unless she asked for them. \u201cShe showed me a stack. She said I did not have to read them.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe kept them,\u201d Mina said, looking not at me but at a point just past my shoulder like she was watching a future queue for bread. \u201cSometimes she writes ahead, and when she gets to the place she wrote about, she puts the letters down on the table and sees if the room is true to the map. She wrote to a man named Bret years ago. She liked the mouth shape of it. She\u2019s superstitious like that, but not the small superstitions that make you stupid. The useful ones. She writes to doors and knocks afterwards. It\u2019s a kind of magic that won\u2019t owe anyone interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid she post them?\u201d I asked, picturing envelopes like birds with nowhere to land.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mina said, in the tone people use when someone has asked whether a person went swimming in a river in winter. \u201cThat would be a curse, and she doesn\u2019t do curses. She writes and ties and keeps and then unties and lets the past air out and then ties again. It\u2019s how some of us don\u2019t drown. Don\u2019t make a face at me as if I have said the wrong thing, it isn\u2019t a tragedy unless you point at it until it performs.\u201d\n\nI did not know I had made a face. I thanked her for the parsley because manners are the last fence left to us in an untidy world. She touched my arm briefly, the way people do when they want to know if you are a temperature they understand, and then she was gone. I watched her go with the astonished affection I keep discovering I have for strangers who know more about me than I do.\n\nThat evening Iris knocked with a small jar in her hand and an expression that suggested the jar had been born difficult and she was being patient with it. \u201cOintment,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not be alarmed by how it smells like a decision made by a forest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am familiar with forests that make decisions,\u201d I said, stepping aside, and she wandered to my kitchen as if she had signed an agreement with my countertops and could therefore lean on them without guilt. \u201cMina gave me parsley. She said soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe believes soup can fix a country,\u201d Iris said. \u201cShe isn\u2019t wrong. She once improved a very bad marriage with carrots and patience. The marriage undid itself a year later, but everyone ate well.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to sit?\u201d I asked, because standing was a choreography we were both tiring of. \u201cDo you want tea?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want,\u201d she said, and then paused like a person locating a word they had left in another room. \u201cI want to ask you if you are angry at me for being a person.\u201d\n\nI wish I could tell you I said the correct thing immediately. There is a version of me who is very good at being good. He makes cameos and is then unavailable for long stretches. I put the kettle on and it made the complaint it makes when it has been asked to work before it is emotionally ready.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not angry,\u201d I said, which was true and cheap. \u201cI am\u2026 finding out that the parts of me that like to put things on shelves are not always friendly to the part of me that wants to live entirely in the middle of a room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made my skin an argument,\u201d she said, sitting at the table and touching the jar to the wood like a respectful knock. \u201cI did it because I was tired of not arguing. I can see that when I lift my sleeve now, I am making you look at a thing you did not subscribe to. I don\u2019t want you to look if looking hurts you, but I also cannot carry myself like a smuggled package. These two truths do not kiss easily.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like your sleeve,\u201d I said, and we both laughed at the idiocy of that sentence, and somehow the laugh did more good than anything else we might have tried. I made tea. I made it with my whole back, which is how I make tea when I want to appear like a domestic person the world can rely on. Iris watched me and her face softened the way faces do when they decide to forgive at least one thing in the room.\n\n\u201cDo you want to see something that is not my skin?\u201d she asked when we had both distracted ourselves with sips. \u201cI don\u2019t mean art, exactly, but it is a cousin.\u201d\n\nShe went back next door and said, \u201cTwo minutes,\u201d and then came back with a small square wooden box. It was the kind of box that belonged to people in nineteenth-century novels who keep hair and decisions in cedar. She set it on the table and opened it, and inside were small squares of color on paper, like paint had decided to complete itself into a deck. She laid them out, patient, each with a pencil line of date. The shades moved from honest greens to dishonest blues to reds that almost dared you to say the word red out loud. I put my hand near them, not on them, because sometimes touching is a violation even at the level of ink.\n\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d I asked, although the answer was also there, obvious, like a friend you have not met yet but have seen in a photograph.\n\n\u201cA day,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve painted every day for a year. Not pictures. Not subjects. Just the weather of it. I try to make a color that is the closest I can get to what the day was asking, and then I write down the date and the time I knew and I put it in the box. Sometimes I get the color wrong and it haunts me for a week. Sometimes I get it and the rightness makes me too proud and then I leave the lid off to teach myself humility. This one\u2014\u201d She tapped a pale, cold blue with a small coil of gray crouched inside. \u201cThis one is the day my sister called me after a long silence and told me about the house with no corners. I didn\u2019t know how to make that color, so I made the color of not knowing. This one\u2014\u201d She touched a warm, indecent gold. \u201cThis is the first time I sold something that did not feel like treachery. This one is the morning you told me about a hedge that wanted to be a country.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I get a color?\u201d I asked, lightly, and then closed my mouth because sometimes you ask for a thing and then you remember you don\u2019t know what it will mean to have it.\n\n\u201cYou do,\u201d she said, and she did not reach for a new square. She lifted the lid of the box and there, on the inside of it where the wood had darkened in the shape of keeping, she had painted a small, disciplined line of ink that was neither blue nor black but the exact color of the corner of my suit where the fabric catches morning. \u201cI gave it to the box,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause not everything wants to be on paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to kiss you,\u201d I said, and it was the first time I had let a sentence leave my mouth without a permit, and it crossed the air between us without looking for crossings.\n\nShe set the paint square down slowly and looked at me with every part of her face, which is a kindness people do not extend nearly enough. \u201cYou may,\u201d she said, and then, a heartbeat later, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nWe stepped toward each other like people who had been warned about a floor but had decided to trust their feet anyway. Her hand moved to my arm, below the place where her own skin was tender, and she said, quietly, \u201cI will not show you what I am not ready to show you, and you will not look for what I do not offer, and we will be two people in a room with a good map.\u201d Then she kissed me, and the room reorganized itself around the new geography, and nothing important was broken. My body did a very small flinch when her sleeve grazed my wrist near the place I know us both to be shy. She felt it and paused and rested her forehead against mine like a person leaning on a doorframe in a strange house, and then I made the deliberate choice to put my hands around the back of her neck where skin is less about decision and more about kindness, and I kissed her again and did not even notice what the trumpet was doing somewhere out there in the ongoing Thursday of the world.\n\nAfter, we sat with the box open between us and the tea cold because tea does not like to be ignored. Iris put the lid on, reverent, and did the jar ritual with her arm while we talked in the way you talk when you have just returned from somewhere you could not take pictures. She told me about the sound design job where she made a room in London feel like the bottom of a swimming pool and the CEO of a company cried because his mother had taught him to swim in water that smelled like pennies. I told her about Mr. Langley and the language people use when they cannot say stealing but cannot bear to say mistake. The evening slid into us without having to knock. When she left, she put her hand on the doorframe and said, \u201cTomorrow, come to the cathedral with me if you can. They will do a thing with candles and very old music and I would like to pretend with you that we are always this old and very young.\u201d\n\nIn the cathedral at Candlemas, the world was persuaded into being a different shape for an hour. The nave was dark in a way only old rooms are allowed to be dark; there is a contract somewhere that specifies this. People held small flames like birds learning to trust the hand. The choir did not try to be surprising, and their refusal was a kind of relief. We stood near a pillar carved by a person whose hands must have ached for days and watched light move across faces as if it were considering who to forgive. Iris\u2019s fingers were cool and dry, and when she took my hand later in the hymn that everyone pretended to know, I felt a precise gratitude that I have rarely felt without wanting to bargain for more. A child a few rows ahead tried to blow his candle out and his mother put her hand gently over his and said, Not yet, and the not yet landed on my tongue like a small medicine.\n\nIn the soft noise of coats and whispers afterwards, Iris tipped her head toward the Lady Chapel like someone indicating a caf\u00e9. We moved that way and she stopped just inside the threshold, a place where people leave flowers for their dead and prayers that do not have addresses. She looked at the altar and then at me.\n\n\u201cMy father hated these rooms,\u201d she said, not asking me to approve of him. \u201cHe said they made people sentimental and useless, and he said that like it was both one thing and two. He liked to fix engines the way some people like to fix sentences. He took me once to a service like this and stood the whole time like a person being inspected, and afterwards he said something that sounded like contempt but was really fear. He is frightened of things that ask him to put down his tools. He does not know what his hands are for when they are not full.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father loved a tap,\u201d I said, because sometimes you owe the room an offering, even if it is only a domestic one. \u201cWe would go to houses and he would show me that if you listen long enough you can hear where water is hiding. He would be very suspicious of your box of colors.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would be right to be,\u201d she said, and we smiled at two men who will never meet, and perhaps that is for the best. We walked out into the nearly-night and the bell did a quiet inside-my-throat sound, and at that exact moment a boy with a trumpet walked past us, a case under his arm, and we looked at each other like children who have just seen a mythical animal decide to be ordinary.\n\nWe followed him because our honesty is selective. He turned down a street I know like the seams of an old jacket and went into the square where people who do not wish to be found practice not being found. He took his trumpet out and did not do anything foolish like looking around to make sure he had an audience, and he began to play an unambitious scale that still found a way to argue with the air. We stood at the edge of a bench and did not sit and did not apologize for standing. After a while, he noticed us and lifted his chin in the international sign for Are you going to make this into a problem.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good on Thursdays,\u201d Iris said, the way you would address someone whose dog you have been admiring.\n\nHe shrugged and did the trumpet equivalent of a smile. \u201cI like the echo.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like making your neighbors hate you on purpose?\u201d I asked, because I am still, despite my efforts, a petty man sometimes.\n\n\u201cThey can come find me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives people something to do. It is better than them going home and committing small crimes with their phones. Anyway, I\u2019m not always playing. Only on the days that have edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday has edges,\u201d Iris said, and the boy nodded like a person who has decided she is not a threat and perhaps an ally. He put the trumpet down. \u201cDo you play for someone?\u201d she asked, and he looked at her in a quick, assessing way, and then his whole face changed like a room that has decided to open its curtains.\n\n\u201cMy sister,\u201d he said, eyes on the protective felt of his case. \u201cShe\u2019s in the hospital until she decides to stop pretending. She pretends she\u2019s fine and then her body argues with her. I go there and play on Thursdays because the nurse I like works then and lets me stand under the window in the stupid courtyard with the stupid bins. They won\u2019t let me closer because I am contagious because I am a person. I come here first, to warm up. The buildings here listen better than the hospital does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hear you sometimes,\u201d I said, which felt like a confession and a compliment. \u201cI was going to submit a petition to the council.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo,\u201d he said, grinning with relief I did not know I was capable of causing. \u201cPretend I am a menace. It makes me feel like I\u2019m not being ignored.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Iris said softly, and there was a shape of pride in her voice that had nothing to do with him and everything to do with a person deciding not to flinch. We left him to his scales and walked back on streets that had changed their names without telling anyone.\n\nIn the days after, my house learned a new rhythm that included the sound of Iris\u2019s knuckles against my door and my own reluctant bag of oranges telling me I was allowed to be clumsy sometimes. I went to Perpetual Ink alone once, because sometimes a person will go to the edge of a picture to see if the paint will chip. The man with the long fingers looked up, and his face did not move much, and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re fine,\u201d as if I had asked him to read my fortune. I looked at the prints on the wall and understood none of them and half all of them. There was a sketch pinned near the counter, of a shape like the one I had seen on Iris\u2019s arm, except it was not finished, and in the margin in a hand not quite disciplined enough for the job someone had written absence in a very particular shade of pencil. I did not ask, and he did not tell, and we had a perfect conversation.\n\nBack at the office, the Langley situation grew legs. Money has a habit of taking not only walks but also holidays, and we were now required to draft a letter that would be sent to a man who wore shirts that have their own budget, gently suggesting that the firm where he has always kept whatever he could not be bothered keeping track of had, for reasons temporary and technical, mislaid a sum that could be described as uncomfortable. Dawson asked me to write a sentence that would make guilt sound like weather. I wrote: \u201cIn the course of reconciling accounts that, due to the unprecedented circumstances of the last quarter, have not been as current as we would ordinarily maintain, certain transfers have proven difficult to substantiate, though we anticipate swift clarity.\u201d I hated me and my education a little, and then I did what you do and printed it and put it on a desk and watched as someone else signed their name to it. Priya caught my eye and did not offer solace, because we had used an entire week\u2019s supply of it on the girl at the shoreline.\n\nThat evening, in a small act of penance I may have imagined, I went to Mrs. Pell to buy bread and eggs and she told me a story about the time her husband put too many bulbs in a patch of dirt and the spring had a tantrum. Iris came in halfway through and bought lemons and honey and a newspaper she would not read, and we walked out together and she said, \u201cWould you like to see the painting I turned to face the wall again because it refused to be moral?\u201d\n\nIt was not so much a painting of a body as it was the idea of bone in light. The collarbone that had made me want to confess was there, but not as a seduction; it was there as a hinge. Another line curved with the modesty of someone who had decided to be naked without inviting anyone to comment on it. The colors were not colors you would use if you were trying to sell anything. They were the colors left at the bottom of a palette after a day, the ones you get when you mix decisions. It was beautiful and disturbing and I loved it in the way you love something that has already made up its mind.\n\n\u201cYou see why I turned it,\u201d she said, and I said yes although I did not, entirely, and it is possible she knew that about me. \u201cSome things need a wall to think. Some things need looking. I wish sometimes that I could be more decisive about which are which.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could do what Dawson does,\u201d I said, because I am rude when I am tender sometimes. \u201cYou could sign a letter that says both and neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh yes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then make soup.\u201d\n\nWe ate in my kitchen because kitchens like to tell you their own stories and are less earnest about it than dining rooms. The soup was Mina\u2019s and tasted like someone had paid attention to carrots. We ate on stools, because chairs felt too formal for broth. Iris kept her sleeve rolled more to her elbow that night, and I looked and did not look, and she saw me doing both, and neither of us apologized. After we had done the dishes, which we did with an argument about which sponge is best for pans, which we enjoyed more than we should have, we stood very close because the kitchen is a small legal jurisdiction and we had both violated several ordinances already. She put her hand on the back of my head and I put my hand at her waist and we kissed like we were saying thank you to the same invisible benefactor.\n\nThere were still moments when my body did its small animal thing and shifted away from the line of ink like it had been taught by an unwise ancestor to avoid certain plants. I told it, gently, to be quiet, and it obeyed as well as bodies ever obey their owners. Iris noticed when I was brave and when I wasn\u2019t, and neither of those seem to be the parts of me she was tabulating for a verdict.\n\nOne late afternoon, when the light pretended to return at four and then withdrew the promise like a politician, Mina came by with a Tupperware and a look. She did not knock in the way most people knock; she announced herself with the scraping of her shoe on the mat like a cricket. Iris let her in and they stood in the hall and did small dances with their hands. I stayed on the couch, eyes on a book I was only pretending to be reading.\n\n\u201cYou told him about the letters,\u201d Mina said, voice low but not secret. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\n\u201cI showed him,\u201d Iris said. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him the parts that belong to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him the parts that he thinks belong to him,\u201d Mina said. \u201cIt will save you both time later.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am telling you both now,\u201d Iris said, raising her voice just enough to let me in on the fact that I had been let in deliberately, \u201cthat I wrote a letter once to someone I had not met and it said his name and it was the wrong person and I sent it anyway and it was a mess and then I learned not to do that. I keep them now because keeping is a kindness. This is not a coded thing meant to make you perform, Bret, it is a confession of an old method. I do not want you to be jealous of a girl who loved a person she had invented. There are real people to be jealous of, and we can timetable them.\u201d\n\nWe all laughed then, the kind of laugh that says yes to the right joke and no to the wrong ones. I put the book down without pretending further and went to the hall and took the Tupperware from Mina like a notary. \u201cYou will be all right,\u201d she said to me, and I would have liked to know whether she meant tonight, or this month, or the year, or the great abstract elevator that will one day take us all down to the ground floor, but I did not ask her to be precise.\n\nWhen she had gone, Iris turned to me and looked like the sort of person who can taste iron in water. \u201cI do not want to mislead you,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mark on my arm is not about you, and it is not not about you. It is about the part of me that promised, long ago, not to let a certain thing happen to me again. No one broke me. I am not doing this to rebuke anyone. I am putting a rope around the pit in the ground and writing the word pit around it in very large letters so that when I walk I can see where I must not step. That is the absence. I do not know if you are the kind of person who will pretend you do not see a rope when someone has put one there. I hope you are not. Sometimes men are terrible at ropes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am excellent at ropes in theory,\u201d I said, with a seriousness that surprised me. \u201cIn practice I will need to be told I am at the edge because my eyes are not clever and I have been taught to look at the sky to see if the weather is coming.\u201d\n\nShe put her hand over my mouth the way you do not put your hand over someone\u2019s mouth in public, and I kissed her palm in a way that made her criticize me later for being glib and then agree to it again six minutes after that. We were ridiculous and correct.\n\nIt is necessary, too, to say that in that same week my neat life put its elbow on the wrong lever. Dawson called me into his office at the end of a day that had already given me seven reasons to pretend to faint, and he said, with the weariness that makes men perform their dignity too loudly, that Langley had found the sums himself, mis-shelved in a spreadsheet like a book put away under the wrong initial. We would be able to say that our letter had produced clarity. He was pleased with himself in a way that made me want to dress him in humility. Priya rolled her chair to my doorway after and said, \u201cI suppose we have not been invited to drown ourselves in the Ver in penance,\u201d and I said, \u201cNo,\u201d and then, because the room needed it, \u201cBut we could go to the park and listen to the geese swear.\u201d\n\nWe did. We sat on the damp bench and watched the river lecture itself into curves, and the crows patrolled like moralists who had forgotten their first point, and the ducks had arguments with themselves and won and lost them in the same gulp. Priya took a small metal flask from her coat with deliberate theatre and produced a drink that had the decency to be harsh. She offered and I accepted and the heat it made in my throat felt like a hand on my sternum telling me to sit still.\n\n\u201cYou look like someone who is learning a new language,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cThe kind they don\u2019t teach at school, because school panics at nuance. You are excellent with nuance at work. It appears you are less excellent at it when your shirt is off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to be inelegant in front of people,\u201d I said, and she snorted and looked away at the exact right angle to make the snort love instead of cruelty.\n\n\u201cYou should try it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may find the person you are really very competent at falling on his face. Some of us measure our competence in wrong units. Do you want to tell me the honoring version of what is happening, or do you want to tell me the version where you come off better. I am available for both.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe put a thing on her arm,\u201d I said, because I had to name it somewhere. \u201cAnd my body decided to be cowardly, and then my brain tried to pretend my body had made a typo. I am working on my body\u2019s literacy. Also there are letters. And a boy with a trumpet who is preventing the apocalypse.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said after a long pause, during which a goose made a noise like a derogatory memoir. \u201cI approve of almost everything you just said. It is appalling that you had to get a girlfriend before realizing that bodies are part of the bargain and not just devices for transporting heads and briefcases.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not\u2014 we have not\u2014\u201d I said, and then gave up the ditch because it was not worth defending. \u201cShe told me about a rope around a pit. I think there is a rope around a pit. I am not good at identifying pits.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are excellent at documentation,\u201d she said. \u201cDraw a map. Put a rope on it. Write pit where necessary. And then for once in your life do not argue with a woman who knows what she is talking about when she says, Here, the ground gives way. Also, do not be jealous of old letters. Jealousy of paper is the most humiliating of male sports.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will put away my green ribbon,\u201d I said. \u201cI will write in my little book, Pit here, and try to remember not to picnic on its edge.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d she said, which I should have hated and did not. We watched the river keep being water and not morals. The cathedral peeped over the trees like an ancient friend who does not want to intrude. We went home and the city did not mind.\n\nThe next morning there was a note on my step with a fish that had corrected its own smile. It said, Back Thursday, Arundel. It turned out she had taken a train to a town she liked because the lines on the map there were satisfying, and she sent me a photograph of a castle and a river that had decided to be decorative. I read the note and read an entire library of other things into it because I am my own enemy sometimes. I wanted, absurdly, to ask her to take me with her into places where my neatness would be useless and my usefulness would be tested. I wanted to do my work and to sit and not be good. I am no longer certain I will get to have both. I put the note on my mantel with the candle crater and the pen, and I left it there like a person who knows he is building a mantel the way other people build altars and is too prudent to call it that out loud.\n\nShe returned on Thursday smelling like rain that had learned manners in a different town. We met on the path without needing to pretend we were surprised, and she told me about a woman selling sandwiches who said Arundel like it was a verb, and how she watched a child say no to a dog very politely and how the dog obeyed because politeness is a language dogs like to practice. She had bought me a postcard of a medieval figure with a sword who looked like a person in a good suit and a bad mood, and she had written on the back, For the days when the law sharpens itself on you, and I put it on the fridge with a magnet shaped like a lemon because that is where it looked pleased.\n\nThat night, the trumpet did not play. The fox did not scream. The street made a pause, and the pause held. Iris sat on my floor because chairs are less honest than floors, her sleeve rolled, her arm a new map I was learning to read with the right kind of caution, and we spoke like people who had decided to be both old and very young in the same hour. When I went to bed, I did not do the inventory of corners. I lay on my back and let the dark take attendance, and for once I did not worry that it would mark me absent. Somewhere, in a drawer, a letter with my name in someone else\u2019s hand waited, and I did not open it. I looked at the ceiling until it blurred into a color I could not name, and I thought, I could get good at this, and a part of me that has never trusted anything agreed out loud.",

                              "content": "The week decided to open with an envelope that had the humor to pretend it was just paper. It waited on Iris\u2019s step with its serious blue lettering like something you ought to put down before you realized that you were holding it at all. The rain had tried itself on once or twice and stepped back into the cupboard, and the pavement was the kind of cool that makes your breath feel like the glass it fogs. I saw the envelope before I saw her, which is not how I prefer the order of things, and for a moment I thought, perversely, of Christmas and its confident red and green, how invitations arrive wearing costumes to tell you how to treat them. This one wore a costume that said, You will not enjoy me.\n\nShe opened the door with her hair a fraction less deliberate than usual, a sweater with threads the color of cut pears, and a look that was not yet surrender. The corner of the paper had gone soft from being carried around the living room while she decided where to sit with it. She held it up like a specimen she hoped I would identify kindly and said, \u201cIt says Notice,\u201d and then added, as if quoting a particularly ungenerous friend, \u201cSection Twenty-One.\u201d She said the number with an accuracy that made the air around it respectful.\n\nMy body did its professional rearrangement. Even in a doorway with oranges plotting their mutiny in a bag at my feet, you can feel your organs pick up clipboards and take attendance. I took it, and I did the quick read you do when the blood is busy and you have to look like you can persuade it to stand still. It was what it was: time dressed in legal language. Sixty days offered like a joke without a punchline. The name of a letting agent with a logo that tried for inheritance and landed on dentistry. A signature that had practiced being important.\n\n\u201cDid he speak to you?\u201d I asked, keeping my voice in the register you use when children have just woken up from a troubling dream and you have agreed to pretend there are no monsters in the wardrobe while the monsters themselves write a polite letter.\n\n\u201cOnly by van,\u201d she said, smiling without moving her mouth. \u201cHe was outside yesterday with a ladder doing something aristocratic to a gutter, and when I waved the wave you wave at ladders he executed a very precise look in the opposite direction. This arrived after lunch. Mina told me to sit down with it on a hard chair, the way you sit with guests you are not inclined to coddle.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a surprise,\u201d I said to the part of her that did not want the words and to the part that expected them anyway. \u201cIt is, however, not the end. There are rules about deposits and clocks and how you say a thing before you get to do it. We can make the clock behave for you for now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake the clock behave,\u201d she said, tasting the words as if they were soup and needed salt. \u201cI thought that is what the candles were for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe candles are for the soul,\u201d I said, not entirely in jest. \u201cThe letters are for the clock.\u201d\n\nShe stood aside and I followed her into the house that had just been told by an envelope that it might have to stop being itself. The room felt like a person who has put their hands in their pockets to be polite. On the mantel the jar for her arm sat like an appointment, and on the windowsill the plant did its best impression of optimism. She put the letter on the table as if it might leap off and confess its motives if it thought no one was looking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go yet,\u201d she said, almost diffident with the confession. \u201cI have just told the walls that they have work to do and they have not yet finished being what I asked them to be. I know houses are not dogs. I know they do not come when you call. I just\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are allowed to want,\u201d I said, which is an absurdity that occasionally still needs saying out loud. \u201cWe will make the timetable tell the truth about itself. Let me see your tenancy, and the deposit, and any versions of conversations you have had with him, and what the world thinks your notice period is. Sometimes there are small errors. Sometimes those errors are enough to make the universe revise its plans.\u201d\n\nShe put a hand over the paper in a way that would have been an oath if there had been a book under it. \u201cYou will not wear your tie at me,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean\u2014 you will not become a man made entirely of velcro and Latin at me. I would like you to be Bret in a jumper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be Bret in a jumper,\u201d I said, which was true in both the literal and the complicated sense. \u201cMy Latin is in a drawer. I will only take it out if the letter is rude in a language I can\u2019t persuade with English.\u201d\n\nWe did the work, which is to say we put the kettle on as the universe requires before we do anything that intends to change another thing. She had the papers in a folder more dignified than our purpose deserved; the deposit had been put somewhere correct but late; the gas certificate had missed a year the way years sometimes fall through the cracks of people who have decided to be careless as a hobby. I took notes in my small book with the pen she had found in a video in Japan, and it felt like using a scalpel to slice bread. When I used words like compliance they landed in the room and did not ruin it, which is a skill I wish I always had.\n\n\u201cWe can write,\u201d I said, and she nodded like writing was a verb she could endorse. \u201cWe can ask for clarification with the sort of politeness that makes men behave. We can ask for the mistakes to make themselves useful. We can make the clock say a different hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say we very beautifully,\u201d she said, racking two mugs on top of one another as if building a little shelter. \u201cYou say it like a verb instead of like a pronoun.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is always better when we can be a verb,\u201d I said. \u201cPronouns are fine for introductions. Verbs repair gutters.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, when we had put the paper back into its temporary coffin and the letter into a sleeve as if it were contagious, we sat, and the room returned to being a room where two people had lived for an hour instead of a courtroom in a cardigan. She rested her forearm on the table, and the dressing shone, a neat admission that bodies insist on time when time misbehaves.\n\n\u201cIt is a cruelty,\u201d she said, looking at the window without seeing it, \u201chow rooms have to unlearn you. All your shapes go out of them like the tide, and they sit there as if no one had ever put down a cup and left a small witness ring. I am not noble. I have not earned the right to be moved.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one asks nobility from the moved,\u201d I said, and the part of me that knows what words do felt the small heat that comes when one lands near the right place. \u201cThe only noble thing here is the kettle.\u201d\n\nShe laughed then, sudden and grateful and more for herself than for me. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cGood kettle. Brave kettle. We will write to the man in the van and tell him that he must also become a kettle.\u201d\n\nWe did. Priya, later, took my draft and softened three things and sharpened two and removed one sentence that had been included for the pleasure of seeing if I could write it, which is a bad habit I pretend is not a habit. She read the notice with her eyebrows making their very specific shapes and said, \u201cDeposits are always the weak link because men like to keep small suns in drawers,\u201d and I loved her for the way she can be both tender and clinical without contaminating either. Dawson peered at the letter and said something florid about the rights of tenants that I will not repeat because it will ruin your supper, and then looked at me with a paternal benevolence that sat on him like a hat that had been left too near a radiator.\n\nBefore the letter could make its journey with stamps attached like confident birds, Thursday came and with it the boy and his precise noise. The square behind the hospital had bins that had once been yellow and now were the color of tobacco. The courtyard has an acoustics that was clearly designed by a committee of very clean people. The nurse with the braid and the authority of a person who knows where syringes live stood in a doorway and pretended not to watch. Iris, alert to languages I barely hear, had asked if she could come and listen and say nothing, and the boy had made the shrug that is a yes when you are sixteen and practicing how to carry permission without letting it leak.\n\nHe played scales like fences and then like rivers. At one point he did something no trumpet owes anyone, a soft unambitious melody that turned the air into a small apology. I stood with my coat unbuttoned because I wanted to be honest to the cold. Iris put her hand in mine half-way through a note that made a particular window on the third floor decide to tremble, and I had the brief and pure sensation of being included. A shadow moved in that window, and then a wrist and then a palm and then the absence of gesture that is sometimes more eloquent than any wave. I did not know if the sister saw us; I suspected that even if she had, the seeing would have been for herself.\n\nA security guard with shoes softened by long corridors approached and did the thing that makes me respect men in uniforms: he looked like he was rehearsing the kind of authority that could hold the room and then chose not to perform it in public. He nodded to the boy and said, \u201cThree more minutes,\u201d and the boy made a sound with his lips that meant, to my amazement, gratitude. Iris did something subtle with her body, an angle of her shoulders and the tilt of her head, and the sound changed in a way that made the space around us feel like it had been re-tuned. Afterwards, when the nurse with the braid spoke to us, she said, \u201cThank you for being small,\u201d and I wrote that down, because it is not a sentence I had expected and I want to be asked, again, to make myself less of a problem.\n\nOn the way back we walked through streets that have decided to be deeply themselves in February. The shop that sells bulbs in cages had replaced moons with stars in smaller cages. The charity shop had admitted a piano that took up important breathing room and was called SPLENDID on a paper sign by someone who had not played it. The boy had told us the sister\u2019s name. It lives in my mouth now like a fragile instrument and I will not put it here because not everything is ours.\n\n\u201cMy mother used to call Thursday small Friday,\u201d Iris said, stepping over a puddle that had pretensions to be a lake. \u201cShe was always trying to get the week to move faster, as if she had somewhere to be that did not involve us. When I was little I would hide her keys, which is a terrible thing I am not proud of, but I would do it and then cry when she left anyway because you cannot ever hide what a person has decided to be. I think I am sometimes hiding keys still, and I would like to apologize to anyone who has been late because of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was late the day I saw you,\u201d I said, which is partly true and mostly myth, and the truth is something like a rope around a pit anyway.\n\n\u201cThen you have forgiven me in advance,\u201d she said, and the look she gave me did useful things to the architecture of my throat.\n\nThat night I spoke to my mother with the ease of a person placing something on a shelf and the difficulty of someone trying to find a shelf that will not immediately come down on his head. She asked me if I was eating, which I answered with a piece of chicken on a plate as evidence, and then she asked me if I was sleeping, which I answered by moving my eyes very slightly away from the camera. She uses the names of days as if they were types of weather. When I told her about Iris, not everything, because I am not good at enough and she is better at it than I am, she said, \u201cAn artist, is she,\u201d in the tone that puts an extra comma in the sentence, and I did my best only child thing and said that I had been to services where a thousand candles made strangers into a temporary nation and that I had held a hand in a square behind a building that smelled like disinfectant and promises, and that nothing had burned down, and that sometimes when you do something in a room, the room agrees. She looked at me as if I had managed to use a screwdriver without supervision and told me a story about a neighbour who kept peacocks and never swept their complaints off the path, and I realized that she was telling me she had decided not to be afraid of my news.\n\nIt was a small reprieve to go to work and let numbers bite at ankles instead of letters. There was a morning where I lost an hour finding a comma I should not have lost, which is a separate species of shame, and then there was a call from Mr. Langley\u2019s assistant who has a voice like someone who used to teach piano to surgeons, and she told me that Mr. Langley would send a bottle and a note and that he did not like to think of things as mis-shelved, only temporarily disguised as other things, and would I be so good as to assent to his version of the world in writing. I wrote a note that said nothing in the precise way you are taught when you are first given a suit, and I put it in an envelope that did not deserve my name on it. When the bottle arrived, Dawson opened it with the relish of a man playing at ships, and we took a glass and did the thing you do where you look meaningful at each other over liquid you cannot afford alone.\n\nPriya leaned in my door later and said, \u201cDo you want to tell me now or later that you are in love with someone with a map,\u201d and I said, \u201cLater,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood, we will be inefficient with our time for once,\u201d and then the afternoon did that thing it does where it lies down and refuses to be roused, and we gave up and walked down to the river and let the cold show us our edges.\n\nWhen I got home there was a note pushed under my door with the fish grinning as if he had made himself a promotion. It said, I want to show you something, but not if your brain is made of lawsuits. I considered honestly whether my brain could be returned to meat in time and decided yes, with conditions. I knocked and she pulled me into a room that had had its furniture rearranged by someone who had learned the philosophy of chairs overnight. On the table, the square box of days had been opened and would not close properly because it was at capacity, and around it were sheets of paper more serious than canvas, the kind you buy when your wrists have ambitions. On one of them, in the cleanest black I have seen outside of a crow\u2019s wing, was a diagram.\n\n\u201cIt is a lie,\u201d she said before I could speak. \u201cIt is also true. It is the rope as seen from above. I put the pit on paper so that if I forget and if a person asks me to be generous about my memory, I can point at it and say, Here. The pit does not move. It does not have feelings. It is geography. We do not forgive geography; we go around it or we fall in and then we tell the story. I told the tattooist they could write absence so small in the lines that no one would read it but me, but he said ink is not good at secrets, and I said that is the point.\u201d\n\nI stood with my hands carefully in the air above my pockets like a man in a museum who trusts his arms only when they have been assigned chairs. The drawing was both elegant and, somehow, almost shy about its own edges. The negative space in it had a shape like someone standing sideways in a doorway. It was undeniably beautiful and it was also a thing that made me angry because it made me want to be better than I was, and I do not always enjoy being given homework by art.\n\n\u201cMay I be stupid for a minute,\u201d I asked, and she looked at me the way a very good teacher looks at a boy who is about to be very brave in front of a room. \u201cWhen you say pit, I think of the place I put all the versions of myself that were not promoted. I understand that your pit is not that. I am trying not to make it mine. I do not wish to picnic where you learned to count.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may be stupid for more than a minute,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may be stupid as a method. I will tell you when your stupidity is a fence and when it is a path. The only thing I will not have is your pretending not to see the drawing when it is on the table. Men pretend not to see drawings and it makes the world unbearable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see the drawing,\u201d I said, and she nodded, satisfied not at my compliance but at my transparency. She put the diagram in the box on top of the day that looked like a thin sheet of bone and the lid almost shut. We stood in our two houses with our one fence and the eighth of an inch between politeness and the lack of it, and then we did not stand anymore because standing is a ceremony that has to be interrupted if it is not to become worship.\n\nThe letter to the man with the van did its work. His agent wrote back in a tone that had been curated to sound competent, and informed us that the deposit had indeed been put somewhere like a dragon sitting on a plate and that the notice would be reissued with apologies, and that obviously it had nothing to do with anything except how the world is, and would she be so good as to admit that. We sent them a paragraph about gas certificates that sounded like a lullaby if you did not speak the language, and I gave Iris a timetable that looked like an arrangement with winter. She put it on the back of a cupboard with tape that had had a life before this and saluted it each morning like it had saved hers, which is a habit I am going to adopt for the calendar above my desk.\n\nThere was a night when Mina appeared with an umbrella and a face that had argued with a bus driver and won, and she brought a parcel the size of a clementine and said, \u201cSmell,\u201d and we did and it smelled like green. She told me a story about a woman in her twenties who had been given a plant by a man who asked nothing in return, and how the plant had died immediately because sometimes kindness is a shock to the system. She told Iris she had found a frame in a shop that was secretly made of good wood and that she had bought it against the day when a day demanded existing twice. She told me that if we wrote to the man with the ladder in a way that made him afraid of his own conscience we would be doing him a favor. There are people who are engines in rooms, and you do not know the wattage until the light changes.\n\nLater, after Mina left us a recipe that was more of a reminder, Iris took down a bundle of letters and put one in my hand with the care you give a child a fragile thing: do not drop it, do not run with it, do not try to eat it even if it is sweet. The paper had been folded and folded and then smoothed and then folded again the way skin folds over time regardless of whether you approve. On the front, my name in someone else\u2019s hand, a past version of hers who wrote like a person running to catch up with herself.\n\n\u201cYou can read that one if you want,\u201d she said, ambiguously generous. \u201cIt does not betray anyone. It is the letter where I invented a lamp and told it it was you. Be cautious with my sixteen-year-old sense of drama. I have largely forgiven her. Mostly I am grateful to her for doing the first draft.\u201d\n\nI read, hungry and then careful. She wrote about the light in a shop on a wet day, and the way people\u2019s faces behaved differently in the reflection of glass than they do in front of themselves, and about a boy whose name was mine who laughed at a joke and then took it back, and about the river when it decides to be sounded like pennies and mirrors, and about the woman who sold lemons in a bag that made everything else the lemon thought about. She wrote like someone who could not keep ink in a bottle, and if I had met her then I would have been no use to her at all. I folded it back into itself with reverent incompetence and gave it back, and the look on Iris\u2019s face when I did that will endure longer in me than any case law I will ever cite.\n\nThe following Thursday the boy did not appear and the square was like a mouth that had forgotten a word. We stood anyway and did the respectful nothing that attendance is; the nurse with the braid nodded at us like we were the right kind of harmless, and then, just when a silence had started to think itself the only thing left, the boy came running with his case, and he did the kind of panting apology that includes the thing but also apologizes for the day. \u201cThey moved her,\u201d he said, so quickly the words slid into each other and became objects. \u201cDifferent window. I had to find the new echo.\u201d\n\nHe looked so young then that my chest did the involuntary thing it does when you hear a body announce its age without meaning to. Iris put her hand on the case as if steadying the instrument and the boy in the same gesture, and she said, \u201cWe will learn it with you.\u201d He blew a note and the courtyard made its best effort to be useful. The new window was where the building had decided to tuck a kindness it had not told anyone about. We stayed longer than we should and no one told us to leave, which is how the world earns a reprieve.\n\nOn the street that night, with the lights doing that pleased-with-themselves thing they do when they are the only decoration anyone can afford, the landlord\u2019s van was out front of number 12 and the ladder was in performance. He was a man with a face like a door that tries to look like a window. He stepped down in that careful way men step down when they have been told their balance is admirable and they do not want to insult the compliment by falling. He saw me seeing him and did a small calculation and found his manners. \u201cAll right?\u201d he said, in the dialect of men who will let you starve in their kitchens and ask if you have eaten.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, which is a code for not at all. \u201cYour agent received our letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, eyes travelling past my shoulder to my window because people look at windows when they are thinking about money. \u201cLot of fuss. My cousin says if you live up north you can just tell people what to do and the roof agrees. But I don\u2019t live up north and my cousin is an idiot, so we\u2019ll do it by the book. She all right in there?\u201d He jerked his head in the direction of Iris\u2019s door with a theatrical casualness that made me want to nail politeness to the front of his van.\n\n\u201cShe is all right in there,\u201d I said. \u201cShe is better than all right. She has art on the walls.\u201d\n\nHe made a face like a person who has just remembered a childhood injury he cannot prove. \u201cArt,\u201d he said, with the tone of a plumber who has discovered a skylight where there ought to have been a pipe. \u201cRight. Tell her I won\u2019t be unreasonable.\u201d Then he climbed his ladder as if he'd just learned to do it that way and had been complimented on the improvement.\n\nI told her what he had said and she laughed, not out of cruelty but out of the relief that comes when fear has to perform under supervision. \u201cUnreasonable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will send him a ribbon if he manages it. We will write Thank you for being average on it in neat italics.\u201d\n\nWe continued to be the kind of selves we were making with each other. There were mornings when she left before I did and I would find the smell of her tea in the hallway like a small echo. There were nights when I forgot to be efficient with sleep because her hair had decided to classify itself as geography and I had argued with it the way men argue with maps. The absence on her arm healed into something that seemed at home with itself, and the first time she swam after it\u2014 in a pool that had decided to be generous at an off-hour, with a lifeguard the color of brick and a sign that said NO BOMBING as if anyone had tried recently\u2014 she emerged and stood and the water made a hundred versions of the same decision, and I had the thought that if there is a God, he is suspicious of fences but he approves of towels.\n\nPriya, vigilant and unromantic, asked me on a Monday whether I had stopped mistaking weather for plot yet and I told her I was failing honorably. She said that was acceptable as long as I continued to turn up to court with both shoes.\n\nThe trouble with clocks is that they keep their appointments even when you have been clever around them. The reissued letter arrived with the redress of mistakes attached like a ribbon. The date had moved; the intention had not. Sixty days coiled on our table; sixty days pretending to be neutral. We laid out calendars the way you lay out cutlery and gave each day a job and a number and I drew lines between them with the same steady hand I use when I escort words through a document nobody wants to read.\n\n\u201cWe can plan so hard we forget to inhabit the plan,\u201d Iris said, because of course she said it. \u201cWe will write, we will argue, we will ask the council to remember me like a good pupil, and we will paint the days, and we will also drink our tea while it is hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will,\u201d I said, which was a vow trained in a cathedral and let loose on a kitchen.\n\nI did not know what form the interruption would take and I am embarrassed by that, because interruptions have a grammar and you can learn it if you listen in the hall for long enough. It arrived as a message from a small device in my pocket that has more status than it should and it said that my father had fallen, which is not a verb I like attached to the person who taught me to stand on a chair very early and not be foolish about it. He had fallen in a garden that used to be a proper garden and had treasured leaks weeping in ancient taps that had always done their best, and he had been found by a neighbor who kept dahlias in disciplined rows and judgments in looser ones, and he was at the place with the disinfectant and the bins and the echo. I stood very still while the room discovered how to make itself into a hallway and Iris came near me in a way that did not ask permission because some kinds of touch are not about permission but about gravity, and she said nothing and waited as if waiting was a profession she had been practicing for years.\n\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d I said, and she nodded so that the nod might carry me, and Mina appeared without having been called with a scarf like a banner and a bag with the sort of things in it you only know to bring if you were a mother once and can still smell when soup is required in a different house. The street had the courtesy to be smaller while I put a coat on the wrong way and then the right way, and the bells, because they have a schedule, did not ring for me.\n\nAt the hospital, corridors bent like questions. My father sat up, which relieved me to an extent I am ashamed of, and held his mouth as if it might say things of its own accord if not supervised. He saw me and did the thing men do between other men when tenderness cannot find a place to sit, which is to insult the obvious. \u201cYou look tired,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cSo do you,\u201d and then he shut his eyes because something about the arrangement of lights had decided to be too much effort and I was suddenly and completely made of patience. The nurse with the braid passed us and I had the ridiculous and unhelpful thought that the hospital had only commissioned one nurse and used her gently in all rooms like a good lamp.\n\nHe was fine, they said. It is a word that was not made for fathers. A hip bruised, not broken. A head examined and found intact and, astonishingly, a hip flask produced from a pocket with a comedy that made the doctor put his hand on the wall. I walked him home under a sky that had decided to apologise for a thing I had not heard, and in his kitchen, which is a museum of floating screws and jars with uses only he can articulate, he told me a story about his first case as a plumber, and I told him nothing that would make him afraid of me, which is a kind of kindness I wish we did not owe our parents. When I left, he stood with his hand on the edge of the door and said, too casually, \u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d and I said, too quickly, \u201cYes,\u201d and then we both laughed at each other because neither of us are convincing liars.\n\nI walked back along the Alban Way because when you are trying to put your chest into a shape people can tolerate, a path without houses is a good idea. The trumpet boy passed me at a run, case against his thigh, and I did not stop him because some urgencies are ordinary and do not require witness. When I turned onto Clarence Road, Iris was at my door, leaning with her forehead against the cold pane lightly as if listening to a rumor. She looked up and came towards me in three steps that were not dramatic and still did the necessary thing, and she put her hand on my face and held it there and taught the skin to be calm again.\n\n\u201cSoup,\u201d she said, and I almost cried because I had not realized how many problems use the same solution. We went inside and the room organized itself around us politely and I told her about the fall and she told me about a painting that had failed in an interesting way and we made being alive together look like an activity that had instructions but did not need them. Afterwards, when we had done the dishes with the right sponge\u2014 do not write to me about sponges; I will not be moved\u2014 and when the street had decided that it would let us be obscure for a few hours, she said, \u201cIf I disappear for a day because the new rope tugs me, will you come find me,\u201d and this time I said, \u201cYes, and I will be tedious about it,\u201d and we both agreed that sometimes tedium is love in work clothes.\n\nThe envelope with the landlord\u2019s second intentions continued to be itself on the cupboard door. The boy\u2019s sister moved rooms and windows and we tracked her like saints with an app. Priya gave me a list of men worse than me and told me to stand at the end of it with dignity. Mina told me that when she left the country she loved she took photographs of the taps in the sinks of public buildings because sometimes that is how you carry water with you. The fox acquired a limp and then discarded it on a Monday like an accessory.\n\nI would like to tell you that Chapter Six is where I learned to be easy. It is not. It is where I learned that absence is a thing you can draw and still be surprised by the hole when you step into it. It is where a letter wore a coat and rang my neighbor\u2019s bell and made us put diagrams on the table. It is where a boy learned a new echo and where a father performed gravity and where a van decided to be civil. It is where hands learned new permissions and the kettle kept behaving even when time refused to. You would think that would be enough for a person. You would be wrong, but only by an inch, which in some rooms is all the difference between falling and staying upright.",

                              "content": "The day the council wrote back, the envelope was the color of earnest potatoes. It sat on my mat with an authority it hadn\u2019t quite earned and made the hall into a tiny office. I picked it up and my hand did the ridiculous tremor it reserves for documents that might change the furniture. Iris appeared the way she has learned to appear when letters arrive\u2014she does not make a noise; she is simply there, as if summoned by the warding ink on the front. We stood with our shoulders almost touching and made the complicated decision to open it in my kitchen rather than hers, as if the kettle could confer jurisdiction.\n\nInside, the words behaved. They told us someone would \u201cengage\u201d with her \u201csituation\u201d and \u201cassess her vulnerability\u201d in a tone that made vulnerability sound like a hobby gone too far. There were bullet points that attempted kindness and a list of dates that would be our dates now whether we liked them or not. Near the bottom, there was the sentence I had been wanting and dreading: \u201cWe will require evidence.\u201d I could have written it myself on any day in my career and hated me for the neatness of the phrase.\n\n\u201cI have evidence,\u201d Iris said, sitting and laying her arm along the edge of the table with an ease that was not yet ease and not yet not. \u201cI have a whole museum. Receipts. Letters. Photographs of gutters behaving badly. Paintings of days. Would they like a box of colors. Would they like a trumpet. Would they like my mother\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will want the kinds of evidence less persuasive than those,\u201d I said, because the truth does not always help. \u201cBut we can bring both kinds and let the room decide if one can teach the other.\u201d\n\nShe wrapped both hands around her mug and nodded like a person agreeing with a sensible song. The dressing on her arm had been gone for a week, and the ink had learned her skin and her skin had learned its ink, and sometimes my eyes forgot to flinch and sometimes they did not, and on those days I kept my hands busy with spoons. She looked at the council letter again and smiled with no teeth. \u201cEngage,\u201d she said. \u201cThey make engagement sound like a duel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I said. \u201cOnly with clipboards.\u201d\n\nWe started to gather proof in piles that should not have looked beautiful and did. Mina arrived with a plastic folder that had clearly been repurposed from a schoolboy some decades ago and put on the table the exact sort of biscuits people tell themselves they don\u2019t like. \u201cDo not be original,\u201d she said, tapping the letter with two fingers that have signed more petitions than I will ever read. \u201cOriginality makes civil servants nervous. You will bring them the buttons they recognize and then later you will show them ribbons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a drawer of ribbons,\u201d Iris said, and Mina smiled like someone whose belief in her had found fresh reasons.\n\nThere were practical intrusions too, because clocks keep their promises. The letting agent, having learned the word compliance recently, discovered the word viewing. He phoned in the tone of a dentist announcing a minor procedure and asked whether \u201cprospective tenants\u201d might be introduced to the rooms \u201cat convenient intervals,\u201d by which he meant at intervals convenient to his commute. Iris handed me the phone without commentary and I became the man with the voice I keep for other men who have invoices.\n\n\u201cYou will give twenty-four hours\u2019 notice in writing,\u201d I said, as if we were discussing weather. \u201cYou will propose times. You will receive refusals. You will propose different times. You will be reasonable. And you will not tell anyone she has to let people into the place where she keeps her sleep.\u201d\n\nThere was a silence into which a smaller man might have poured apology. This man poured policy. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be accommodating.\u201d He said accommodating like a room with too much furniture. We wrote him a letter anyway, to make the law sit near us on the rug.\n\nWhen the first viewing came, everything in number 12 made itself look like itself. The plant stood up straighter; the sofa decided not to be apologetic; the three turned canvases on the opposite wall remained turned, which felt like an act of mercy. Iris drew a chalk line on the hall floor in a clean arc from the skirting board to the edge of the door and looked at it with an expression so grave the chalk nearly curtsied. \u201cBoundary,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will be polite to them. They will not step over this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to be unpolite,\u201d I said, and then I ruined my own sentence with a smile.\n\n\u201cI like being unpolite with purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cNot for sport.\u201d\n\nThe agent arrived with keys and nervousness. With him came a couple who had the careful happiness of people who had been looking for a long time and had agreed between themselves to not betray how much they wanted to be done looking. Behind them was a single man in a jacket that considered itself performance and a woman with a clipboard who wore her hair like a declaration of independence. We introduced the rooms like they were shy children. The man in the jacket walked to the mantel and fingered the jar with ointment and the jar looked up at me and said, silently, please remove him. The woman with the clipboard asked about boilers in a way I approved. The couple stood together like geography and looked at the light as if they had applications to submit to it.\n\nIris spoke very little. She had learned to be small without diminishing, a skill I cannot teach. When the man in the jacket opened his mouth to say something about \u201cthe vibe,\u201d Mina, who had appeared to water the plant at the exact inconvenient moment, turned to him and said, with a smile that could butter knives, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you like the walls. The walls like to be treated well. They remember.\u201d\n\nAfter, when the door shut with the sigh a door makes when it has been made to work too hard, Iris and I stood within the chalk arc and not outside it. I felt in that small pale curve the full intelligence of the rope she had spoken into the skin of her arm, and a contrition I did not owe anyone presented itself anyway. She looked at my face like she was skimming a book she knows by heart and nodded, as if to say, all right then, you were paying attention.\n\nAt work, Dawson produced a file in a color that has never meant anything good. He put it on my desk like an expensive brick and said, with the benevolence of a man about to ask a favor which he does not intend ever to repay, that a partner at another firm would be grateful if we could address \u201cinformal arrangements\u201d in \u201ca family matter\u201d with \u201cdiscretion,\u201d which is a cousin of secrecy that eats better. The details brought the worst out of the paper: money, yes, and property, and in the middle of it two boys who had shared a bedroom until someone left and took all the air with him. The client wanted to be reassured that the law would not punish him for how he had arranged his life after the leaving and before the paperwork caught up. I have patience up to a line. It is possible the line was painted on the floor when I wasn\u2019t watching.\n\n\u201cIs there violence,\u201d I asked, which is the first question when everything has already started moving furniture.\n\nDawson did a face. \u201cNothing actionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cActionable is a poverty of language,\u201d I said, which is a thing Priya has taught me to say out loud even when men are wearing good coats.\n\nPriya stole the file when Dawson left the room and put her finger under the sentence that said \u201cexclusive occupation,\u201d as if it were a splinter. \u201cThey want to move the children like chairs,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou can say no with a very pretty voice if you need to.\u201d\n\nI took the file home and put it on my table next to Iris\u2019s timetable because we do not live lives where subjects can be segregated well. She looked at the top sheet and made a small noise in her throat that meant she could smell iron again. \u201cWill you be good,\u201d she asked, without tone, and I answered with the same absence of theatre, \u201cI will try.\u201d\n\nI found myself, that week, holding pens like weapons. The fountain pen she had given me had become the metronome for my days; its nib made decisions and I followed them faithfully. On Tuesday I signed my name so many times the shape of it blurred, and I had to write it once very large on an envelope not for posting just to remind my hand there was still a person with a mouth attached to the strokes. On Wednesday, in a lunch hour that refused to sit, I went to Perpetual Ink and stood among the pins and the prints and the smell of antiseptic bravery and asked the man with the long fingers whether he had ever written on himself with ordinary ink.\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d he said, as if I had asked whether he breathed. \u201cAll the time when I was a child, and then my mother would do the thing with spit on her thumb like a magician, and now when I am trying to find the edge of a thing I use the kind that will not last. Makes room for mistakes. Makes room for the days when you want to be a different speech.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me as if I was a map he had been paid to read and added, more kindly than he needed to, \u201cIt takes a certain type to put their own name on their skin and mean it. Most people only want pictures of who they\u2019ve met.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want a rope,\u201d I said, surprising myself with how easily the word came. \u201cBut not the kind people see when I go to court.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, unsurprised. \u201cThen draw it more often than you need. In pen. In pencil. Not because you don\u2019t commit\u2014but because you practice obedience to yourself.\u201d\n\nI went back to the office and drew a line on the inside of my left wrist with the fountain pen, thin as a vein, and washed it off before the meeting with Dawson. The faint ghost of it stayed as if ink had opinions. Priya saw it and did not ask me a question; she raised a single eyebrow in that very competent way she has and moved a file from my left to my right in case I forgot which hand had weather.\n\nMy father phoned me on a Thursday, which is a day he considers vulgar for telephones. He sounded like kettle steam. The fall had turned his balance into something he had to argue with in small rooms, and he hated arguing with anything that did not have a washer to fix. \u201cYour mother used to say I fell up,\u201d he said, without preamble. \u201cThis time I fell down. We must cover all directions so as not to show favoritism.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come up this weekend,\u201d I said, because sometimes obedience is not a wound.\n\nHe made a skeptical noise about my car, which is a reasonable noise to make if you have ever seen my car, and told me a story about an apprentice who had decided to keep parts in his pocket and how it went very badly for the sink. He did not ask about Iris. He will ask about Iris when he believes he will outlive the answer. I told him anyway, which is a small rebellion. I told him she made boxes of days and that her arm had learned a new alphabet and that she is a person who knows where the pit is. He grunted, which is how he metabolizes information that wants to live in his stomach instead of in his mouth, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be made a fool of,\u201d which is his way of saying be brave. I told him I would try to compromise between those two.\n\nThat night, the boy did not play because the sister had been taken to a room without windows and the nurse with the braid had asked us both, in the kindest voice I have ever heard in a corridor, to be ordinary somewhere else. Iris took me to the river which is where she takes me when she wants my mouth to be quiet. The water had decided to be opaque about everything. It wore the sky like a second story and did not regret it. She stood very still as if being in one place long enough could persuade the world to tell the truth, and I thought suddenly, and quite without permissions, that there will be a morning when she will live in another house that is not this one and I will make a cup of tea in my kitchen which will be my kitchen and maybe also not, and I will feel the shape of her not-here and it will be a furniture in the room.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d she said, as if I had said any of it aloud.\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d I asked, genuinely not sure which part of me had been impolite.\n\n\u201cMake the future the villain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe future is already sorry. It doesn\u2019t need you piling on.\u201d\n\nWe stood until our knees accused us, and then we walked through streets that had decided to let their lights be kindly instead of clever. In the window of the charity shop, the SPLENDID piano had gathered two stools, perhaps by sympathy. The shop had put a sign on it that said TRY ME in a hand that refused to be humiliated by chalk. A child with a hat too large for her head sat and hammered middle C like a telegram and the woman beside her said, with a patience I want to bottle, \u201cYou can try other letters. They do exist.\u201d\n\nThere was a morning\u2014I do not know which one; it exists outside calendar\u2014in which Iris and Mina made soup with a seriousness that caused the onions to obey. I was allowed to slice bread, which is a task I can be trusted with when watched. They spoke, these two and their long history, about ingredients as if listing virtues. Thyme, Mina said, is faithfulness without aggression. Bay is patience with form. Lentils are a union. They did not talk about men and I was the better for it. When we ate, Iris\u2019s sleeve slipped and her skin did that gleam it does when recently in contact with soap and rubbing, and I watched myself not look away. I watched myself not force looking. Later, washing dishes, she pressed the heel of her hand into my lower back without thought, as if her body had learned that I was furniture that did not mind its job, and I had to go into another room for a minute and tell my chest it could stop pretending to be a cathedral.\n\nWe went to the council together, which is a sentence you do not get to say unless certain clocks have refused to be charmed. The building was exactly itself, a municipal agreement between beige and industriousness. Outside, the cigarette smoke of the worried and the routine made a slogan of the air. Inside, the woman who saw us first had a cardigan with moral opinions. She took Iris\u2019s name and spelled it three different ways until the name gave up and spelled itself. Then she said, with bureaucratic dignity, \u201cTake a seat,\u201d and we tried without grimacing the blue plastic seats that have been designed to correct posture in seven nations.\n\nThe officer who came to fetch us had hair like a promise she had kept a long time ago. She led us into a room that had forgotten its first purpose and asked Iris questions in a voice that made my own voice take its shoes off. Iris answered as if she were painting a day: not the picture of a thing, but the weather of it. She told the truth without stage directions. When asked for evidence, she laid her papers on the table like a dinner service she would let anyone eat from and also protect with her life. The officer took notes in handwriting that made me believe in legibility. When we showed her the defects in the notice, she did not perform delight or disdain; she said, \u201cThat will help,\u201d and tilted the page so the fluorescent light didn\u2019t hum over it.\n\nAre you at risk, she asked then, the most serious question in the repertoire. Iris looked at her arm and not at her face and said, \u201cNot from anyone who is in the room,\u201d and the officer did a thing I will remember\u2014a small nod that conceded a battlefield she had not been allowed to enter and respected anyway. She gave us dates and a list of acronyms that had learned to live together and pressed a card into Iris\u2019s hand as if cards could be medicine. When we stood, she said, to Iris, gently, \u201cTell us if anyone tries to make you move your own rope,\u201d and Iris said, \u201cI will tell you and I will be very boring about it,\u201d and I put the sentence in my pocket to keep.\n\nOutside, the fox crossed the car park in daylight, his indecency made daylight-proof. He looked like he had taken a class in urban policy and found it beneath him. We watched him go with a fond contempt I recommend.\n\nThe partner at the other firm called me that afternoon, his voice prepped to be collegiate. He wanted a letter that would, as he put it, \u201ccalm the waters,\u201d and his waters were two boys who had a mother in one house and a father in another and an arrangement that flattered the adult timetable and insulted the children\u2019s. I told him I would write what the facts would bear and he said the phrase \u201cagreed narrative,\u201d and I said \u201cbest interests,\u201d and we both said the word \u201camicable\u201d with sincerity and fully aware of its limits. When I put the phone down, Priya rolled her chair into my doorway and said, \u201cI am so tired of people wanting affection to be measurable,\u201d and I said, \u201cMe too,\u201d and then, because she is not wrong about ritual, we went to buy very bad coffee.\n\nThat evening Iris knocked and did not wait for me to say come in, which is not rudeness in our dialect. She stood in the hall and lifted her sleeve and I braced and did not need to be braced because there was nothing new to be seen except my own failure to be frightened. \u201cIt has stopped being a guest,\u201d she said, in that tone of wonder people have when they realize the cat has decided the house belongs to it. \u201cI thought I should tell you. It will take its shoes off without being asked now. If you want to look, look because you like the room, not because you\u2019re checking for burglars.\u201d\n\nI looked. The lines had softened in the way a line softens when it becomes a fact. The negative space did its calm work. I realized that what had scared me at the beginning was not the ink but the announcement of someone else\u2019s decision, and I liked myself for disliking myself, which is a curious but useful position from which to make changes. \u201cI like the room,\u201d I said, and her face did a very small shift that loosened the skin over her cheekbones and allowed the girl who wrote letters to boys she hadn\u2019t met to peek out and then politely retire.\n\nShe told me then about her father, not a full story, but a shelf. He had written to her when she was twenty with a letter that contained more suggestions than salutations. He had told her to \u201cpresent better,\u201d which is something men say to women when they are afraid of mirrors, and she had not spoken to him for a year and it had been both a relief and a sickness. The tattoo, she said, was not about him because he is not a pit, he is a man, and men do not get to be pits just because they are deep and loud. But the rope, she said, is about the habit of agreeing with suggestions. \u201cWhen I put my arm down on a table now,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m putting down a map where someone else might have set a meal. It helps me remember not to eat when I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n\nWe fell into the kind of quiet that is not a pause but a plan. She sat on my floor and drew lines on a napkin that became leaves that became a staircase that became nothing you could name without sounding like you had made the world on a Thursday. I wrote in my notebook in the untidy way I do when the pen wants to be quick. In between those activities we spoke about the trumpet boy\u2019s absence as if he had gone to fetch a word and would be back with it soon. We made the tea behave and then asked it to forgive us for letting it drift. We watched a program where people with aprons made cakes the size of insults and we were unkind about one of the judges and instantly remorseful, and that is, I think, the proper ratio of vice to correction.\n\nOn Saturday I went to my father\u2019s. The train practiced being late and then was late properly. The sky decided to do all its weathers in one small rectangle. My father opened the door with a dignity that had been ironed and un-ironed several times. He had put the kettle on the moment he heard my feet and it made the kitchen seem good-mannered. He showed me the bruise on his hip with an abruptness I have learned is his version of intimacy, and it was livid and purposeful, like a country he did not intend to stay in. His sink, known to me since childhood as the place where screws propose to nuts, stared at me as if to say we were both not behaving like equipment today.\n\nWe quarrelled gently in the way people do when the quarrel is an old house they have both lived in and neither want to pay council tax on anymore. He told me to move the screwdriver I had moved and I told him his lightbulbs were a hazard and he told me my hair was falling out and I told him his temper was not a tool and then we laughed and ate sandwiches that had remembered to be simple. When I left, he did a thing I did not expect: he pressed a small, surprisingly heavy parcel into my hand wrapped in paper that had once belonged to Christmas. \u201cYour mother kept this,\u201d he said, staring over my shoulder at the coats. \u201cShe told me not to give it to you until you were likely to do something unsensible with it and then take responsibility. She said I wouldn\u2019t know when that was, so I suppose you\u2019ll have to tell me if I\u2019ve got it wrong.\u201d\n\nOn the train I opened it because I am incapable of waiting when an object announces it has a story. It was a round brass pocket watch, scarred, weighty, its back engraved with a pattern that looked like frost learning to be geometry. Inside, where the mechanism\u2019s heart should tick, there was a small note in my mother\u2019s hand that said, In case you ever need to slow the afternoon. I held it and the train took a corner and in the window I saw the long, ridiculous face I have always had and the very specific angle at which it softens when presented with a kindness I do not deserve. I brought the watch to Iris and she held it like a bird and then put it to her ear and said, \u201cIt is not working,\u201d and then, \u201cNo, I am wrong, it is working in a different room.\u201d\n\nWe took it to a man near the market who fixes time for a living. His shop was a museum of measurement. He spoke very little and listened to the watch and then to my name and then to my mother\u2019s handwriting, because some trades insist on being fed with stories. \u201cIt is delicate,\u201d he said, which was his way of saying, you will have to live with how it behaves. He said he would coax it and perhaps it would do us the kindness of remembering its old job. We left it there and walked away with a piece of paper that promised nothing more than a possible reunion.\n\nThe trumpet boy returned that week with a borrowed instrument and a face that had learned the word wait. The sister had moved to a room with a garden no one is allowed in. He played in the square and the hospital pretended not to notice and the bins were very quiet. Iris stood with her sleeve down and her hands in her pocket and her mouth made a shape I hadn\u2019t seen on it yet, a shape that said I am older in this second than I was when I woke. When he finished, he did not look at us. He packed the trumpet like an apology and then, after the case had closed, turned and said, \u201cHer name is Ruth,\u201d and then left the name with us as if it were a parcel we were entrusted with on the understanding that we would not open it unless we were asked.\n\nThe landlord\u2019s agent wrote to offer us a compromise that was not a compromise but a calendar with a red square around the day he would prefer to have keys in his hand. We wrote back with politeness that had teeth. Priya took my draft and inserted three phrases that would make a county court judge feel as if he were being done the favor of remembering a precedent, and reminded the man that people are not keys and time is not his to own. Mina arrived with a coat that had outlived two governments and said, \u201cWe are going to look at a place,\u201d and Iris said, \u201cWe are not going to look at a place without Bret,\u201d and Mina said, \u201cBret is invited if he can keep his mouth from telling the room that it is a room,\u201d and I said, \u201cI will write a letter to my mouth.\u201d\n\nThe place was on a road that had mislaid its notion of itself. It had balconies too small for chairs and windows too large for secrets. The agent used the word \u201cairy\u201d as if he had personally inflated it. The kitchen admitted silently to once being something else. In the bedroom, the light had learned how to get around corners. Iris walked through it with her hands behind her back like a person observing a painting she does not need to buy to understand. She stood on the patch of floor where the boards have given up and jumped once with both feet like a child in a puddle, then looked at me to see if I would scold. I did not. Mina, at the window, said, \u201cIt is enough,\u201d which is the most dangerous sentence a human being can say.\n\nOutside, Iris said, \u201cIf this is the place, I will have to teach the walls new words,\u201d and I said, selfishly and somehow correctly, \u201cNot yet,\u201d and she said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d in a tone that made me brave again for a few hours.\n\nOn an ordinary night in the ordinary week after that, I woke at the hour all kitchens make their private noises. The house felt like a person running a hand over their hair. I went downstairs and lit one of the three candles she had given me months ago, and the light did that small discipline thing I have learned is not to be taken for granted. I took my pen and drew a rope on my wrist and did not wash it off until morning. In the quiet you tell yourself you are keeping watch over the person you intend to be, and sometimes that person turns up and sits with you and steals your tea and asks you to be less ridiculous and you agree and then fail and then agree again.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long chapter eight is supposed to be. In my life, chapters have never ended exactly where I would like them to. They end because a bus arrives or a letter does not or a person with a braid tells you to be ordinary elsewhere. They end because you fall asleep before you finish a paragraph and, in the morning, you discover the paragraph was kinder without you. There is a day coming\u2014and I say this not with dread but with the relief of being allowed to admit it\u2014when the rope we have drawn on paper and skin will be asked to hold. There is a court date printed now on one of our calendars with a sensible font. There is a boy who will teach a new window to echo. There is a watch that is either remembering or refusing. There is a father who will tell me a story about a pipe as a way of not saying he missed me. There is a woman I love who has taught me where the floor gives way and shown me how to step and permitted me to put my hand on the small of her back in the four seconds between a door and a room. If I am being dramatic, it is only because time keeps laying itself gently on brick and slate, and I keep wanting to know whether the bend of it is a kindness or a test. I have learned, at least, to light the candle and let it behave. I have learned to write we as a verb. I am learning not to move the rope. And on Thursdays, when the trumpet finds the square and the boy lifts his chin, I stand in the place where the sound will hit and I let it.",

                              "content": "The watchmaker rang in the morning when the world was trying on ash-grey and kept it, and said, in a voice that had been lifted and put down on velvet many times, that he had persuaded the mechanism to remember itself for stretches of time in the afternoon if handled with respect. He spoke of springs like small laws and cautioned me against winding as if I wanted something. When I collected it, the shop smelled of old arithmetic and lemon oil, and he laid the watch on a square of felt as if he were placing a quiet animal back into its field. On the walk home I kept opening it, not because I mistrusted its face, but because watching the seconds heave themselves forward in a disciplined way felt like a kindness I had not earned. I put it in Iris\u2019s palm and she closed her fingers around it as if she was saving a moth from our stupidity, and we held it to our ears, two schoolchildren with a contraband sea shell, listening for the hour that might slow if we asked nicely.\n\nThe letter from the council that said engage and assess was followed by another with a list that might as well have been titled How To Be Proved. We gathered the things rooms shed: receipts like small confessions, photographs that showed gutters when sunshine had expected to be the subject, the tenancy agreement with its festivals of small print, and a page Mina had found in a cupboard that confirmed the gas certificate had taken a sabbatical during a year when people were being alive anyway. Priya came by in her lunch break under the pretense of borrowing a book she had already read and put a paperclip in the correct place with a gentleness that made the clip feel forgiven. We did not feel like we were winning or losing; we felt like people carrying a pane of glass between us, and occasionally a gust made it urgent that we keep it level.\n\nThe agent discovered the word block-viewing and wanted to show five strangers how the light behaves in Iris\u2019s front room all at once on a Tuesday. I wrote a sentence that placed civility on the floor like a rug and invited him to step onto it carefully, and he wrote back with the particular version of yes that is also a sigh. When they came, the chalk arc on the hall floor improved everyone\u2019s posture. The couple who held each other's curiosity almost as well as each other's hands asked if foxes come in the garden, and Iris said, \u201cThey leave us alone if we leave them their routes,\u201d and the woman with a fringe made of deliberation said, \u201cI grew up where hedgehogs were a rumor,\u201d and looked at the fence as if it might confess. The man in the ambitious jacket touched the spines of Iris\u2019s books with the pads of two fingers and pretended not to read titles. Mina watered the plant slowly and made eye contact with the woman from the agent\u2019s office in a way that persuaded her to put the clipboard down and become human for three minutes.\n\nOn a Wednesday that was so precisely itself the church bells could have used it as a toner, Dawson brought me a family case with the email equivalent of a flourish. The line he underlined twice was \u201cunequal shares of holiday time,\u201d which is a domestic way of saying someone is smoothing their own pillow with the argument that a child should not mind the crease. I said the phrases best interests and reasonable arrangements in a tone that had straps, and spoke to a solicitor across town who hated the word contact but was prepared to use it if it got us all to tea. Afterwards, Priya leaned in my doorway and told me that the word amicable is a place two people can live if they don\u2019t mind the windows being painted shut, and I wrote that down, and later, in my notebook at home, I wrote Iris\u2019s name above it because I am running an experiment on how words behave when they are placed next to each other without explicit instructions.\n\nThe boy with the trumpet came on a Thursday with a determination that made the courtyard straighten its bin lids. The nurse with the braid was in a different hallway but had clearly told the others what kind of trouble we were, because the guard whose shoes know the length of every passage in that building nodded at us like we were volunteers who had quietly turned up again. He played not scales but a tune so ordinary it made the buildings remember their childhoods, something from a radio in someone\u2019s kitchen, long ago, that had told people who were cooking to be patient. When he finished, he pressed his fist against the closed bell like he did not trust his mouth. Later, in the square near the market where older men feed small birds with old bread and political opinions, he told us Ruth had been permitted to sit in a chair in a room with plants for twenty minutes. Iris made the noise she makes when art and medicine shake hands, and I felt the relief you feel when you find a word you had lost down the back of the day.\n\nThe court date to argue with a piece of paper about whether it was allowed to rearrange the furniture arrived in sensible type on a sheet that made us both drink water. We photocopied things that had never wanted to be photocopied and put them into a folder that had learned the stoop of heavy. The morning of, I put on a suit that likes to think well of itself and Iris put on a jumper the color of the inside of a pear and we walked down Holywell Hill together as if it were a corridor with a patient at the end. In the waiting area I opened the watch, and I swear the second hand did an unshowy thing with time that made my ribcage less of a drum. Iris traced the edge of the folder with one fingertip in a loop that repeated and repeated until the loop itself seemed to calm. We were two people trying not to hate furniture, and I say that because rooms like those require such effort to forgive.\n\nThe judge was the exact tiredness of a man who has already eaten half of everyone\u2019s lunch. He listened, which is rarer in those rooms than people suppose. The landlord\u2019s representative had a tie with ambition and a file with the look of a script that had been through too many table reads. We spoke about the gas certificate and its gap, about the deposit which had been placed in the place it should have been placed into but only after the date it should have been placed, about the letter that had learned words but not the right order. When I said \u201ccompliance is not an attitude; it is a sequence,\u201d the judge\u2019s mouth shifted by a molecule and I took it as encouragement. Iris, when asked to confirm her name and address, said both as if introducing a painting to a room with poor lighting, and when the representative for the other side tried to say she had been obstructive about viewings she said, very quietly, \u201cI have been careful with my house while it is still my house,\u201d and I watched the sentence take its shoes off and sit in the judge\u2019s good ear.\n\nWe did not win a flag; this is not that kind of book. We won time. The notice was pronounced defective in the tidy way that men say a pipe is not this pipe but perhaps the correct pipe will arrive later. The judge looked down his long bright road of cases and told the room what would happen when it happened, and the clerk in the corner typed a poem in a language that only printers read. Outside, the boy with the trumpet was not there because this was midday and not a Thursday, but the air behaved itself as if someone had just finished practicing. Mina met us on the steps because there is a clock in her that is not on anyone\u2019s wall and pressed into Iris\u2019s hand a small wrapped sweet that turned out to be parma violet because she enjoys watching modern people be confused by old sugar. We stood for a foolish minute and did not go anywhere, and then we went to a cafe where the coffee disappoints the way certain relatives do, reliably and in a tone of voice that insists you enjoy the tradition.\n\nThat evening we did something I had been putting off and did not know I had been putting off: we went to the late service on Ash Wednesday because I had never learned to be smeared by strangers and still be myself. The cathedral had the intentioned hush of a library at closing, and the sound of people deciding whether to kneel made a music all its own. The words about dust pressed a gentle hand on the brassy parts of my chest. A woman with a face that had become wiser ahead of schedule put thumb to forehead after forehead and drew commas. When she put the black on mine she did not press and she did not apologize. \u201cRemember,\u201d she said, and I did not need the object of the sentence named. Iris came behind me and received her own mark, and the charcoal line on her skin almost shook hands with the charcoal line on her skin, and the part of me that has never believed in coincidence laid down its coat and said, For tonight I will be simple.\n\nAfterwards we bought chips and ate them in paper like a sacrament that admits it is salt and grease and still dares to propose meaning. The ash stayed on our foreheads and no one on Clarence Road told on us to their gods or ours. Iris wiped hers at her door not because she was ashamed but because she wanted to see what she looked like neither marked nor unmarked. We kissed in the lee of the porch and some of the ash transferred to my cheek, and she laughed into my mouth in a low, surprised way that made me want to pay rent on the moment. When I went home I saw my face in the dark glass of my back door and the smudge there made me feel more legible.\n\nThe next day the watch stopped briefly at ten-past-three and began again at ten-past-three, and I cannot explain that any better than I can explain foxes. The fox limped again and then did not limp later, as if a second animal had borrowed his body. At work, Dawson told a story about a golf charity and used the word philanthropic with the same mouth that had asked me the previous morning to make theft sound like weather. Priya brought me a sandwich and a verdict on a new barrister who spoke like a door closing and advised we keep him away from delicate women and any men with mothers. I wrote a letter to a court about two boys whose holidays were being divided like a pie by people who had forgotten that children are not slices, and I tried to be rude on their behalf without swearing.\n\nI went into Perpetual Ink because the door was open and the smell of clean was argumentative. The man with the long fingers had not been reissued in the night as a different man; he lifted his chin in a way that said we had moved on from guessing games. I showed him my wrist with the faint ghost of yesterday\u2019s drawn line, and he nodded the way men nod at engines. \u201cPractice is half of permanence,\u201d he said, and I told him about my mother\u2019s watch and he told me about a sailor who had asked for a lighthouse so small no one could see it but him, and how you cannot rely on ink to be invisible but you can rely on skin to be stubborn. I did not book anything. I did not not book anything. He told me to rub olive oil into the place where the pen leaves its apology, and I said I would and did not lie.\n\nMy father came down to St Albans on a Saturday wearing the coat he wears when he wants strangers to consider him a man of good sense. He pretended his hip was not a man he was on speaking terms with now and asked to see the cathedral because he refuses to be outdone by my life. We stood under the nave and he cleared his throat at a particular piece of stonework with approval, which is my father\u2019s highest compliment for any object not from his trade. He did not mention the ash but he looked at me with the thin amusement of a person who has learned that his son will put marks on himself from time to time as if inviting a conversation with the air. I took him to Iris\u2019s because he is a man who will better understand art if the kettle is in the room with it, and he did the decent thing which is to make no comments for five minutes. When he did speak, he said, to Iris, \u201cYou\u2019re handy,\u201d and there is a scraping, profound respect in his voice when he names someone thus which sounds like mildness to those who don\u2019t know the register. She said, \u201cI am when watched,\u201d and he said, \u201cEveryone is better with a witness,\u201d and I felt the floor push my feet back up in case I forgot how.\n\nThey made soup without performance and he washed up without being invited because that is his profession in rooms where he does not know where anything else goes. He did not refer to the rope or the ink but his eyes knew not to ask, and Iris took her sleeve down without being instructed. When he left he shook her hand as if handing something over, and in the hall he said into his collar, \u201cShe\u2019ll do,\u201d and I said, \u201cFor me or for you,\u201d and he said, \u201cWhat difference do you think there is,\u201d and I made a noise that could serve for affection or murder depending on who transcribes it.\n\nThe landlord\u2019s man discovered a new tone on the telephone that I can only call technically conciliatory and asked whether the 10 a.m. slot on the Wednesday two weeks hence would be agreeable for a further viewing of the rooms, and I said no in a way that made him consider that other people might have mornings. The couple came back anyway at a different hour because they had asked very politely and because they had the respect for chalk that is the gateway drug to other good habits. They stood in the yet-room and said they did not know if they were allowed to love the light when it belonged to someone else. Iris said, \u201cYou can practice loving without claiming,\u201d and the man\u2019s face twitched in a way that indicated a wound and a ready bandage. Mina turned the plant a quarter turn because plants like to have their memories rearranged from time to time.\n\nOn the day that wanted to be spring and then lost its nerve, the nurse with the braid came out into the square and told us that Ruth had smiled at the boy in a way that made the boy\u2019s knees briefly forget which bend they prefer. She told him, very firmly, that he was doing a good job of letting the sound do the talking, and told us, with the same authority, that we were doing a good job of letting him. Iris folded the information into her voice and said the word Ruth as if she was wrapping her in paper that tissue knows how to be. We walked to the park and found the bench that never stops being damp and sat anyway because our trousers needed to learn. The river kept being practical. A dog found a stick and then discovered the holy truth that if you carry a stick you have a job, and its owner, who had the air of someone who had retired from something that should not be retired from, told the dog that this was enough for one morning.\n\nThe watch behaved at four, so we sat very still at four and made that into a superstition on purpose. Iris painted one of her square days with a color that was nearly not a color at all, a thin obedient wash laid over a layer that had been adventurous earlier. She annotated it with the time she felt the afternoon lean and wrote, in her precise plain hand that is sometimes braver than mine, Bret\u2019s mother\u2019s watch remembered. I wrote in my notebook without tearing the page that day, which feels like a lesson I should have learned years ago and was not offered the correct teacher.\n\nWe were not saints or lawyers in our own house every hour. There were mornings when the legal file sat under a bowl of apples and silently judged my domestic ambitions, and evenings when Iris turned a painting to the wall and then turned it back because the wall had not learned its lines yet. There were two arguments, one about the word moving, during which I performed semantics and she let me finish and then said, \u201cWe are both moving even when no one asks us to,\u201d and one about the boy\u2019s mother, whom I had judged for being late to the square without knowing whether she lives with a clock that is cruel. We forgave ourselves these indulgences by doing the boring thing immediately afterwards, which is to tell the truth to the part of ourselves that was flourishing melodrama for its own sake, and then we magneted our apologies to the fridge with the lemon from Arundel because committing them to metal made them more obedient.\n\nIn the middle of the month the council sent a woman with a lanyard and soft shoes to look at walls. She had a kindness that felt union-negotiated and made both of us sit up straighter than necessary. She measured the rooms with a laser that made a red dot skitter, and the fox watched through the window like a critic whose review we would pretend not to read. She looked at the letter from the landlord and at the timetable and at the list we had written in our own ink entitled Things We Have Already Tried, and then she looked at Iris\u2019s face like it was evidence and at my posture like I had been practicing being useful, and she said, with the finality of a recipe, \u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d and I believed her not because of the words but because of the angle of her shoulders when she stood.\n\nAt work a memo did its usual suspicion of daylight and instructed us to remind clients of the limitations of email, as if anyone had ever mistaken a chain for a river. I wrote a letter in handwriting on paper to a man who wanted his former wife to sign a document that had been drafted for the purpose of removing guilt from the story, and I put the letter in a postbox with a red mouth like a declaration and felt like I had done something medieval and potentially effective. Priya told me that if I started wearing tweed she would resign her friendship and then bought me an orange because she had noticed I had been living on the kind of lunches that make a person nervous about doors.\n\nThere was a Sunday we tried on a new church for curiosity and then ran away to the river because the sermon had more rules than weather. There was a Monday I went to my father\u2019s again and found him making an omelette with the confidence of a man who has never had an omelette judge him. He told me a story about my mother\u2019s handwriting that began at a shop counter and ended in a pocket and was, I think, about trying to keep a person near using the smallest objects available. He held the watch to his ear and said, \u201cIt sounds tired,\u201d and I said, \u201cIt has been asked to do a magnificent amount with kindness,\u201d and he said, \u201cSo have we,\u201d and if you hear more romance in that exchange than two men intended, perhaps you are not wrong.\n\nOn a wet morning that had rain with a moral agenda, the landlord\u2019s agent called to ask if the viewing could be \u201cbumped\u201d because a prospective tenant had a train that did not like him, and we said yes with the absentminded mercy of people who had given up counting how many times the same shoe had been placed on the same foot. Iris drew a chalk arc you could not see in wet hall light and we stood inside it anyway, habit asserting itself as an ethics. When they eventually came, the couple did not, and in their place was a man with a notebook who wrote measurements as if he were designing a coffin. He wanted to know if the walls were load-bearing and I told him no wall bears anything without being asked too often, and he smiled with his teeth and said that was not his experience. Mina arrived at the exact moment he attempted to touch the turned canvases and said, in a way that made him reconsider his day, \u201cThose are thinking,\u201d and he left shortly after because sometimes leaving is the correct instinct.\n\nIf you ask me what Chapter Ten is for, I will answer despite having learned that purpose hates company. It is the chapter where the watch remembers and fails and remembers again and we let that be a model. It is where the law makes a sound like a small dog turning around on a rug and lies down. It is where Iris\u2019s rope stays steady and I draw a line on my wrist and become less ashamed of washing it off in the morning in case I have a meeting. It is the chapter where a judge gives you time and you do not spend it like a fool. It is the month of ash and soup and a child who hammers middle C until the piano questions its career. It is where I stand in a square and let a boy teach me how to be present without being useful. It is where I introduce my father to my life and nobody dies in the course of the introduction and that is not nothing. It is where the council lady says We\u2019ll be in touch and I believe her because sometimes a sentence carries its own references in its pocket.\n\nOn a Thursday we did not expect to be different, the trumpet boy came, and stood without putting the case down, and said, \u201cThey let me play by her bed,\u201d and he smiled with his whole face for the first time since we met him and made a noise that was not a note and not a laugh and not a cry and meant all three. Iris reached for my wrist, not the watch one, and I let her hold it as if I belonged to the idea of not making a movement that would scare a happiness away. We stood there while he told us, in the simple order of a sixteen-year-old who has run out of adjectives, about a nurse who held a door open, and a doctor who did not say no, and a woman whose mouth did the thing mouths do when they try to find a corner, and how he had played a stupid tune from the radio and it had made the air feel like a person. We did not tell him that he had saved a day because he knew it already in the same way he will not know it for years.\n\nAt night, when the street decided to be a throat and clear itself politely, Iris drew me on her box of colors in the space that does not admit paper and I did not ask to see because I have learned to enjoy believing in things without receipts. I wound the watch with my gentlest left hand and the hand moved because it had agreed to be moved. I lit a candle and then blew it out because tonight the dark was doing a better job. We lay on the floor because the floor forgives clumsy, and when she lifted her sleeve to adjust nothing in particular I looked and liked the room and did not inventory my own fear and did not write it down. We drifted into a sleep that had corrections pencilled in the margins and left them there for morning, and the fox did his appointments like a civil servant, and somewhere a judge finished his cheese and went to bed. In the middle of the night, I woke and the watch was ticking in the other room, and for once I did not get up to check that it was not ticking without us.",
