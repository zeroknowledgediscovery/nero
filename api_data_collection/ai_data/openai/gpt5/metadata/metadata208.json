     "novel_text": "By dawn the town is a map of damp streets and sleep-warmed windows, an uncertain sketch washed with grey. The tower of St Mary Magdalene leans into the light as if bending to listen to the traffic. The early bus coughs along East Street, the river makes a noise like a held breath. In the police station, they keep the night in a tray and pour it out only when they absolutely must.\n\nHe stands at the window above the car park and watches condensation bloom on the windscreen of an unmarked Vauxhall. The glass fogs over as though the car might be shy. Detective Sergeant Owen Yardley presses a knuckle into his right eye and makes a little firework of colour on his eyelid. Behind him, fluorescent lights hum their cheap unending sermon.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d Maeve Kerslake asks, appearing with two mugs. She sets one down, tea pale as weak sunlight. The corner of her mouth has a habitual smudge of sarcasm, as if life keeps touching her there.\n\n\u201cMore or less,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Vauxhall is definitely here. It\u2019s trying to grow moss.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake the new Mondeo,\u201d she says. \u201cPretend you\u2019re important.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not important,\u201d he says, and takes the tea.\n\n\u201cYou did a twelve to twelve. You\u2019re permitted to talk about yourself like someone people should listen to.\u201d Her hair is in a plait that has escaped several times and been wrangled back with office supplies. A paperclip shows in the twist.\n\nHe nods at the whiteboard. A dead man from Halcon estate with a bruise like a moon under his eye. A burglary that turned into something else mid-sentence, as some sentences do when you say them out loud.\n\n\u201cCredit cards didn\u2019t go,\u201d Owen says. \u201cJust the tin with coins for the meter.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they needed change. Everyone always needs change in this town.\u201d Maeve sips. \u201cDo you dream of crime when you do these shifts?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dream of the vending machine turning against me. The flap refuses to open. I can see the crisps, but they\u2019re for other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. Last week it only took ten pences. I thought I\u2019d entered a 1986 wormhole.\u201d\n\nThey stand a while, each doing the separate work of not thinking about what happens next; the paperwork, the callouts, the small acts of tidiness that might avert a catastrophe or might just be tidy for the sake of it. On the sill there are three dead flies and someone\u2019s spare ID lanyard coiled like a sea snake.\n\nAt nine, they go to High Street where a man in a gilet has been standing very still for long enough to make everyone nervous. He is staring at the window of a craft shop called Paper & Thread. The display is a riot of lime and violet and coral flowers, so thin the light can pass through them and still be colourful. Petals like moth wings, like pastry. A butcher from across the way has come out to smoke and sneer.\n\n\u201cGo on then,\u201d the butcher says to the gilet man, \u201cyou gonna propose to the window?\u201d\n\nThe man doesn\u2019t answer. He has stopped crying. He looks like someone who has just agreed with himself not to do something. Owen speaks to him softly and asks him his name and whether anything is going on that would be made better by a walk to Vivary Park and a talk on a damp bench. The man nods and nods again and they do that.\n\nWhile Maeve handles the butcher\u2019s need to be entertained and the shopkeeper\u2019s very genuine fright at having a crying man press his forehead to her tulips and roses (paper roses, not roses roses, obviously), Owen is left for twenty seconds in front of the glass. The flowers are fastened to a trellis of painted twigs, spirals of green tissue suggesting vines. Somebody has taken time. Somebody\u2019s hand was here, then there, then pinched a fold and breathed out and glued and placed. A little card announces a Saturday workshop. Paper peonies for Mother\u2019s Day, it says. No experience necessary. Tea and biscuits provided. Katie. The script is looped and soft.\n\nHis mother used to roll pastry like a prayer she once knew by heart and could remember with her hands if not her mouth. When she died it was October and his sister put a bowl of apples on the table and nobody touched them. After the funeral, the house smelled like rain in coats. They were not the kind of family that kept flowers.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Maeve asks from behind him, after the man in the gilet has walked away with the leaf-shadow of a decision on his face.\n\n\u201cLooking,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAt the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thinking of moonlighting? Sergeant Owen Yardley, florist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d be paper,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThose are paper?\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like it.\u201d\n\nShe laughs. \u201cIt looks like my nan\u2019s sitting room threw up.\u201d\n\nOn the way back to the station, the Mondeo makes a little rattle like a cough pretending it\u2019s not a cough. Owen drives deliberately, as if the white lines are made of china. He has always done things with his hands that way. When he writes he presses hard and nearly breaks the pen. When he touches a shoulder he does it as if the person might bruise. His hands do not always believe that they belong to him.\n\nThey stop at the crossing by the County Ground. Rain is trying and then not trying, the way it does in Somerset, like someone learning to juggle. Above the stand, gulls shout their thoughts on eternity. The light goes green. Maeve says something that makes him want to be somewhere else for a moment.\n\n\u201cSilas Rook was in the paper,\u201d she says. \u201cYou see?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, but the shape of the name finds all the little grooves in his mind that it has worn over the years. Silas Rook, the town\u2019s cleverest ghost. Owner of a salvage yard called Rook & Rooke, a shop for broken brass and pitted iron and chairs missing crucial legs, a dealer in secondhand glories. Also, historically, well-connected to people who take what isn't theirs and sell it to people who pretend they didn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cPhoto from some charity bash,\u201d Maeve says. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a tie as if he understands a tie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat charity?\u201d\n\n\u201cDogs with insomnia.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cSomething with Labrador in the name. His date has hair like she\u2019s been electrocuted pleasantly.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t say anything. It scratches at him, Silas Rook in print. As if Rook is a real man. Tall with a shaved head, a scar through the eyebrow like someone drew a line to make sure he could be recognized at a distance. A voice that distracts you from the words it is saying. The first time Owen arrested him they were both younger and Rook smiled in the back of the police van as if he were the one driving.\n\nAt the station door, DCI Griggs is hovering like a cloud that is about to be weather. He is the kind of man who looks like he keeps his shirts in the freezer. \u201cYardley,\u201d he says. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve met an idea and you\u2019re not sure if you like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met a window,\u201d Owen says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the time for windows,\u201d Griggs says, not smiling. He never smiles. If he does it will be by accident and in private. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a meet at ten. Bring legible notes from Halcon. If you can do legible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do legible.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Kerslake, I need you in court with me after. The Blagdon appeal. Wear something that suggests you don\u2019t own a dog.\u201d\n\nIn the briefing room someone has left a magazine open on the table with an article titled The Gentle Power of Craft. There are photos of small birds made of felt, buttons with faces, a woman cupping a teacup as if it is a planet she is responsible for. He almost puts the magazine in the bin. He doesn\u2019t. He slides it under the chair just as if the room might be offended.\n\nWhile Griggs reads out things the room already knows and adds the small changes that transform knowing into chastened understanding, Owen finds a piece of torn paper in his pocket with the words Paper peonies for Mother\u2019s Day and a phone number in looped handwriting. He cannot remember putting it there. He must have. Or the window put it there.\n\n\u201cYardley,\u201d Griggs says, \u201care we with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Owen says automatically, catching up with the way sentences are being assembled around him. Responsibilities. Other people\u2019s days. It all fits like furniture when you get it right, and bruises your shin when you don\u2019t.\n\nHe phones the number on his lunch hour, because there is a stupid little buzz in the back of his skull that won\u2019t stop. The phone rings three times and then a voice says, \u201cHello, you\u2019ve reached Katie, I might be covered in glue. Leave a message and I\u2019ll ring you back if my hands aren\u2019t stuck together.\u201d\n\nHe hangs up. Then feels ridiculous and phones again, and this time the voice is real-time. \u201cHello?\u201d Katie says. \u201cIs this glue? Who is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI found your number,\u201d he says, and hears how that sounds. \u201cIn the window. Not the number, the card. I\u2019m not, that sounds like I\u2019m a weirdo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeirdos welcome,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday three till five. You bring your hands and I bring the tissue paper and nobody dies.\u201d\n\nHe almost says we can\u2019t guarantee that. He says \u201cThanks\u201d instead and writes down the address. It\u2019s the back room above Paper & Thread. A narrow stair that will smell of cotton and dust.\n\nWhen he doesn\u2019t show in the break room after lunch Maeve wanders down the corridor to find him and he is in the evidence store looking at a plastic bag with a small ragged thing inside. It is the left-over of a party hat, the crown part, crushed. It smells faintly of hair spray. He is looking at it the way you might look at a creature that doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re watching, as if it could spook and run.\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Maeve says.\n\n\u201cThought it was something else,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing. Leave it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you think it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cA flower.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat looks like something you find under a table when everyone\u2019s gone home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\nShe loves him. Maeve loves him like a sibling you didn\u2019t choose but are relieved to find you like. She loves him enough to say, \u201cCome to the pub tonight and let someone else pick the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might have somewhere to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh really. Hot date with a photocopier.\u201d\n\n\u201cA class,\u201d he says, and then he is annoyed because he didn\u2019t mean to say it like that, like a secret. He looks at the bag again, the crushed fake crown. He doesn\u2019t want his shame touching that pity. \u201cA craft thing.\u201d\n\nHer face does something particular. \u201cBecause of the window,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBecause of hands,\u201d he says, surprising himself. \u201cBecause I\u2019d like to use them for things that are not this.\u201d\n\nShe nods slowly. \u201cYou want me to come and be the loud one in the corner so you can pretend you\u2019re there by accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cThanks. I want to go and be the quiet one in the corner because I can be.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll send you photos of crisps in honour of your absence.\u201d\n\nThe occurrence comes at three\u2014in the small cul-de-sac behind a shuttered off-license where all the bins have been overturned as if some enormous animal passed through and was affronted by the smell. The lad in the tracksuit is sixteen and has blood on his knuckles, not quite his own. There are five boys and the shape of a fight that could have been much worse. Owen stands between and not between, a positioning that is second nature now, and speaks in a tone he sometimes recognises as being not his but borrowed from an old PE teacher who smoothed everything with a joke until somebody cried.\n\nOne of the boys wears a paper crown from Christmas. It is March, but his face is a winter that never finished. The crown sits at a chaotic angle and splits when he lurches. It spills down past his ear like some indecisive petal. Normally, Owen would miss it. Normally he wouldn\u2019t, but he would not name it. This time his eyes catch and keep it and it feels like a sign in a language he is just starting to learn.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d he says, and the boys are relieved. Relief is the unmentioned agreement at these moments. Everyone wanted out. No one wanted to be the one who said so.\n\nThey take statements and call two sets of parents who arrive so full of breath and opinions that the small yard is brimming. Words are said about school and about what certain boys are and are not like. Someone says \u201cferal\u201d with a satisfaction he does not like at all. In the quiet after, all the boys gone, the bins upright again, the air smelling faintly of stale beer and wet cardboard and a little of fear, he pulls the paper crown from the gutter. He does not bag it. He folds it into a square. He puts it in his pocket.\n\nBy five, the light is falling over the rooftops like a shirt shrugged off and left on the back of a chair. He stands in front of the narrow staircase to the room above Paper & Thread and thinks about not going in. The thought is a small, neat square in his chest. He could take it out and unfold it and read it: stay away, people might look. People always look. But people always look. And then they look somewhere else.\n\nHe climbs and his foot hits the edge of a step that is not as deep as all the others and he thinks, in that superstitious way you think when something is almost not touched at all: if the step had been full size, I might not have noticed it, and I might be someone else. The door at the top opens before he can knock. Katie has hair in a knot and long, gluey fingers. Her jumper is the colour of a pond in May.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the window man,\u201d she says.\n\nHe is too tired to be embarrassed. \u201cI might be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re somebody else, you\u2019re still welcome.\u201d She stands aside. \u201cWe\u2019ve got tea and a plate of biscuits that are pretending not to be stale.\u201d\n\nThere are five other people in the room. Two women of retirement age who look like cousins and have brought identical bags with seaside scenes on them. A boy of about eleven who is accompanied by an aunt or an older sister, who has a kind face with firm edges. And a man with a beard who looks like he is here under the cover of supporting somebody else who did not, in the end, come.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing peonies,\u201d Katie says, \u201cbecause peonies are basically glamour crumpled up. We\u2019ll start with templates so no one panics. Panic is available if required, but best done quietly.\u201d\n\nThey sit. He sits. He is like a very tall book leaning itself casually at the end of a shelf, his knees not sure where to go. Katie layers tissue in her hands\u2014pale cream, a pink that makes him think of the inside of a seashell, a darker crimson, a ridiculous ultraviolet that he chooses immediately because somebody has to. The paper is thin as breath but not fragile. It is strong in the way webs are.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Katie says. \u201cThis is the trick. It\u2019s not really a trick. Twist the middle like a tiny sweet. Then pinch. Then you make a crease and the crease is your friend even if it looks like a mistake.\u201d\n\nHe has never thought of a crease as a friend. In evidence bags, in shirts hung from door handles, in old photographs with the line across the boy\u2019s smile where someone once folded the memory in half and put it in the back of a drawer\u2014lines have been borders, endings. He pinches the tissue. He twists. It feels like he\u2019s wringing out a thought.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Katie says, looking at his hands with the kind of patience that makes him want to be teachable. \u201cPeople think flowers are symmetrical and perfect. They\u2019re not. They\u2019re extravagant and wrong. That\u2019s why they\u2019re interesting.\u201d\n\nThe woman who came with the boy says, \u201cI always thought peonies were just roses if they\u2019d had too much gin,\u201d and the boy snorts and the man with the beard lets out a sound that might be the beginning of a laugh before he remembers himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Owen,\u201d he says, because not saying your name in a small room feels like wearing a mask at a children\u2019s party.\n\n\u201cKatie,\u201d she says again. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Mrs. Glass and that\u2019s Mrs. Also-Glass, and that\u2019s Ro and his aunt Min, and that\u2019s Greg who will probably tell you about boats if you ask him anything at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do boats,\u201d Greg says. \u201cI can do rudders and things for keeping water out.\u201d\n\nThe paper rustles like snow that would rather be rain. He folds and pinches and breathes in glue and the soft wild smell of the dyes. His first attempt looks like the aftermath of a cake fight. His second looks like something a bird might sit on if desperate. His third is a peony only in that it is not a table or a chair. Katie takes it, fluffing with her fingers like a barber waking up a haircut. \u201cThere you are,\u201d she says. \u201cYou let it be messy. It does the rest.\u201d\n\nHe puts his flowers on the table and a hush happens in him. It is not dramatic. It is a small room made in a larger room. He has made something that is not evidence or advice or a report or a chase. It is barely a thing and yet his hands say: yes.\n\n\u201cWho are you when you\u2019re not folding paper?\u201d Min asks him, carefully not making it sound like a question that can end a day.\n\nHe swallows. He has practiced the joke you practice when you have this job. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person who walks round with heavy keys and makes people\u2019s kitchens look smaller. I\u2019m a policeman.\u201d\n\nThe boy, Ro, says \u201cDo you have a gun?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cJust a sarcasm launcher. It\u2019s tethered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that dangerous?\u201d\n\n\u201cMostly to the operator.\u201d\n\nMrs. Also-Glass says, \u201cMy Trevor was a policeman. He did the phone calls to tell people things.\u201d She looks down at her flower and says, \u201cHe was good at that and not good at coming home.\u201d\n\nKatie looks at him and then doesn\u2019t, which is a kindness he appreciates utterly. They work until the plate is only sugar and crumbs and all the tea has become brown with the dust of being left to think too long. Ro makes a peony that is almost a dahlia and calls it a hero flower because it didn\u2019t mind being wrong. Owen makes five, because the movements have become, if not graceful, at least something he can trust his muscles to remember for longer than the moment.\n\nThe man with the beard, Greg, says, \u201cI drive to Minehead sometimes. To look at the edge. You can see the water thinking.\u201d\n\nMin says, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t think, love.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt thinks more than I do,\u201d he says.\n\nWalking back down the narrow steps, Owen has the carefulness of a person carrying eggs up a hill. In a box is the flower he will never give to his mother. He knows it sounds like a stage direction from a play you would roll your eyes at. He knows what it is, and he does not mind.\n\nOn the pavement, the air has become a compromise between rain and not rain. The butcher across the way is closing up, a string of sausages on a hook in the window like a necklace someone gave him as a joke. The butcher sees the box and says, \u201cWhat you got there then, Sarge? Valentines in March? Bit sad.\u201d\n\nOwen smiles a little. \u201cIt\u2019s paper,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cPaper,\u201d the butcher repeats, and adds, \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Straw. Is this a farm.\u201d\n\nHe moves on. Behind him the shop door clicks. At the corner by the bus stop a boy with a shaved head and shoes too white to have been worn in the rain says, \u201cYou Yardley?\u201d and there is a flinch in the name.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Owen says.\n\n\u201cSilas sent me,\u201d the boy says. He looks left and right even though that is, in itself, the shout of something being not quite on the level. \u201cWants you to know he doesn\u2019t have your watch. I don\u2019t know what that means. He laughed when he said it. He says you\u2019ll understand.\u201d\n\nIt is an old joke, a job from last year involving a box of spoons and a brave dog and a gullible burglar. Silas had palmed the watch from his wrist as if they were playing cards. Later, as if they were lovers. He had returned it with a handshake that felt like the chin of a statue. He always wanted to make a stage of things; to make a room into a story and put himself at the center of it. He is the kind of man who has learned both his best angles and his worst.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Owen asks.\n\n\u201cWhy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause someone gave you one.\u201d\n\nThe boy thinks about it and remembers his mother for long enough to say, \u201cAiden.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, Aiden. Tell him I understood. Tell him to stop sending children to see me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says you could do with someone to run for your lunch if you\u2019re so bothered by children.\u201d\n\nOwen smiles again. \u201cYou know what a life is? Not having someone else run for your lunch,\u201d he says, and it feels like he\u2019s talking to himself, to the younger one, to a version who would have liked that job because it is performing loyalty without having to mean it. He gives the boy a fiver. \u201cThis is not payment,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s for not standing in the road. Food goes a long way.\u201d\n\nAiden looks at the note as if it might bite him and then puts it so carefully into his pocket that it is, for a moment, moving. He nods and goes. In the reflection of the bus shelter glass, Owen sees himself holding the box of peonies and thinks, Christ. If this were a film I\u2019d be unbearable.\n\nAt home, the flat is the kind that estate agents call bright and a little quirky. It has a window that looks over the river and into someone else\u2019s window where a woman waters a plant that might be plastic. He puts the peony box on the table and stands making small adjustments to the petals that no one else will ever notice. He could not stop his mother dying. He could not fix his sister\u2019s dry, very private grief. He could not undo the way the job takes a little bite from his sense of humour every day. But he can make this. It is not a victory. It is not even a battle. It is a small thing in a room that otherwise holds practical things with plugs.\n\nHis phone vibrates with a text. It\u2019s Maeve. Did you do your paper oath, she writes. Are you now a priest.\n\nHe writes back, I am now Chief Superintendent of Tissue. Bow down.\n\nShe sends three skull emojis and a photo of a packet of salt and vinegar with the caption: your loss is noted.\n\nAt two in the morning he wakes and the flat is all water noises. Somewhere a pipe taps its own skin to stay awake. He goes to the kitchen for water and is frightened by his own reflection, a flash of someone else\u2019s tired nemesis in the black glass. He has that dream again, the one where he has to write a sentence that matters with a pen whose ink keeps becoming water, then smoke, then paper itself. He wakes with his hand curled as if pinching something invisible.\n\nThe next day, a body that might be a murder and might be a poorly-timed heart problem sits in the centre of an upstairs room in a house on Greenway Avenue. The Queen Anne chair looks offended to be near death. The woman's hands are neatly folded on her chest, which no one did. Or maybe someone did. There is a paper flower on the mantle. A peony.\n\n\u201cEveryone has peonies,\u201d Maeve says, shaking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend like planks on walls. Like having a sign that says kitchen as if you were going to cook in the lounge by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is tissue,\u201d he says, and he hates that his voice is the voice of a man who has new knowledge and would like everyone else to sit up straight to hear it. \u201cThis is\u2026there\u2019s a wire inside. See.\u201d\n\nMaeve looks at him and smiles like a fox pretending to be a dog. \u201cYou are allowed to know things,\u201d she says. Then, quieter, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\nHe thinks of Katie\u2019s hands and her simple instructions and the way the paper answered to being touched like it was always going to be like that. He thinks of the window, of the crying man, of Aiden with his too-white shoes and the butcher leaning with his untidy contempt. He thinks of Silas Rook\u2019s boy in the bus shelter and what it means to have messengers in a small town that has only so many metres of pavement. He thinks of the stain on the dead woman\u2019s blouse that is tea and reached there because of a hand that shook or didn\u2019t shake. He thinks of all of it.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s a group in town making peonies.\u201d It is ridiculous. It is possibly obvious. He says it anyway. \u201cAnd I think I need to go and ask questions and not frighten people. And I think we should not tell Griggs yet because he will make his mouth do that thing.\u201d\n\nMaeve nods. \u201cThe mouthing. It is very tabletop.\u201d\n\nHe lifts the tissue paper flower with his gloved hand and studies the ribbon that binds it. There is a tiny tag. He reads aloud. \u201cLove K.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a store with a register,\u201d Maeve says.\n\n\u201cThere is.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course there is.\u201d\n\nBack at Paper & Thread, the bell above the door tries to ring in a demure manner and fails like a bullfinch wedged into a teaspoon. Katie looks up and does not look surprised. \u201cWho died?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask that,\u201d he says, and exhales. Then, \u201cA woman. She had one of yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh God,\u201d Katie says. Her hands flutter. \u201cWhich one.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeony. Cream.\u201d\n\n\u201cI make a lot of those,\u201d she says, and then, because she knows what it sounds like, she adds, \u201cThat\u2019s not me being\u2026 Oh you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d He shows her the tag. \u201cYou write your initials on them?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly for the classes where we box them up. Usually I put the customer\u2019s name because it makes people feel they\u2019re not just buying something probably made by a robot. That one was\u2026 last Thursday? I remember because I burned my fingertip with the glue gun and I had to do it with my left hand. So the K is wonky.\u201d\n\nHe looks. The K is a little drunk. The fact pleases him inordinately. It is not an AI-perfect K. It is a person letter. \u201cDo you keep sales records?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor classes,\u201d she says. \u201cYes. Not for individual bouquets because we\u2019re still on a cash bell-jar system since Izzy messed up the PayPal. Why. Is this\u2014Oh God.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing to do with the flower,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a window.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man in the window? He came back, you know. He bought a little bunch of bluebells for his daughter. She was wearing Spider-Man pajamas under her coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you say it like that,\u201d Owen says, \u201cas if things sometimes go right from offscreen.\u201d\n\nKatie smiles with only half of her mouth. \u201cThey do. And sometimes the wrong things also do that. You look tired. You need sleep and a ridiculous breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say there is never a later. He looks around at the shelves stacked with tissue like folded air and ribbon spools like little hard suns. It is a room made of patience. He leaves her with his card but not with the weight of his day, because that is his to carry and to put down in the correct rooms reserved for that purpose.\n\nAt his desk, Griggs is waiting with a pencil held in a way that suggests he is about to stab a piece of paper into obedience. \u201cYardley,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know what I like? I like officers who do their job and don\u2019t form passionate attachments to crafts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very attached to the stapler,\u201d Owen says.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Griggs says. \u201cRook has been seen near Priorswood with two of his choirboys and a van that may or may not belong to his cousin\u2019s cousin. We\u2019re told,\u201d and he makes quotation marks you can see in his voice even if his fingers don\u2019t do them, \u201cwe\u2019re told he\u2019s got a line on some very charming copper piping. Do copper pipes charm you, Yardley?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dream of them,\u201d Owen says.\n\n\u201cGood. Take Pond and get yourself charmed.\u201d Griggs looks at his hands and sighs. \u201cAnd for Christ\u2019s sake lose the paper on your sleeve. It looks like your laundry attacked you.\u201d\n\nOwen looks down. There is a tiny confetti of cream on his cuff, like he has been blessed by a very specific and benevolent weather. He brushes it off, then flicks his fingers in a silly little shake, as if to get rid of water. When he looks up, Maeve is watching him with a quiet expression that is too kind to hold eye contact with. He looks away first.\n\nAt Priorswood, the van is a van and the pipes are pipes and Silas Rook is not there. He is always not there precisely when you have made a plan to include him. He is a weather system. They do the necessary paperwork and let the paramedics tend to the man who cut his hand on a sharp end of pipe and tried to pretend his hand was not bleeding until he left a trail that made it impossible to pretend anything. There is a child watching from the upstairs window across the street, a curtain held back with exactly as much strength as can be applied without it becoming obvious.\n\nLater, at three, Owen sees Rook in the town centre as if Rook knew that three would be a time when Owen would be doing his thinking walk. He is outside the Castle Hotel, leaning on the wall like he was born to. He has a cup of coffee and a grin that looks like it has been ironed.\n\n\u201cYardley,\u201d he says, delighting in the syllables like a man who has won a raffle and is waiting for you to notice. \u201cYou look like someone\u2019s favourite schoolteacher. What\u2019s that about.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d Owen says, but his mouth says it like a joke. He thinks of the boy Aiden and the message and the watch and the way Rook never stands in the middle of a pavement. Always the edge, always the new angle. \u201cThere\u2019s a way of being, Silas, where you don\u2019t involve other people\u2019s children.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s an interesting philosophical claim,\u201d Rook says. \u201cYou live in a world where other people\u2019s children are like rain. They just happen to you. You should pick a different world if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sent a boy with a message. Don\u2019t do it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI employed a now very slightly richer courier,\u201d Rook says. \u201cHe said you gave him a fiver. Are you trying to outbid me? I\u2019d start a bit higher if I were you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing with you,\u201d Owen says, then ruins it by smiling.\n\n\u201cYou always are,\u201d Rook says, and drinks his coffee. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing for years, and you know what I found out last week? It\u2019s not even tennis. It\u2019s pelmanism. We turn over the same two cards and pretend to be surprised that they match.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened last week,\u201d Owen says, because Rook never says things he doesn\u2019t want you to pull.\n\n\u201cI joined a thing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think I\u2019ll let you find out by reading the paper like you pretended not to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou joined\u2026 a gym,\u201d Owen says, and Rook wriggles with pleasure.\n\n\u201cI joined a gym for my brain. Because my brain was lonely and keeps doing old routines. I thought, Silas, maybe don\u2019t. Maybe learn a new one. Maybe stop doing the thing where you put your hand in someone else\u2019s pocket and take something that doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201d\n\nOwen feels a laugh rise and refuses it. \u201cYou joined a cult.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hired a life coach,\u201d Rook says, calmly, and watches his face closely. \u201cDo you like it. Does it look good on me.\u201d\n\nHe thinks of the craft magazine and the peonies and the dead woman and all the boys in all the cul-de-sacs waiting for someone to choose a sentence for them. He thinks of Silas Rook with a life coach and what that would look like. The coach would have to be a person not afraid of the part of a man who does not want to be touched. The coach would have to have paper hands, strong as webs. It is absurd in the way that suggests it might, for ten minutes in a rare hour, be true.\n\n\u201cThis town,\u201d Owen says, in the tone of blessing you give to a relative who is wearing a swimming hat at Christmas, \u201cthis town.\u201d\n\nRook looks at him, and for a second there is a light he doesn\u2019t show anyone else. It says I am a person with a past, and I might want something different than the thing I have learned to want. It says a lot for a second. Then his mouth goes back into its proper place and he taps the cup with his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll send my man your watch,\u201d he says, smirking. \u201cWe can all be honest. I never had it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Owen says.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d Rook says, and strolls away, getting the last line as always, even when he admits to the mistake.\n\nIn the station, someone has written on the whiteboard in a fat green marker: who moved the stapler. Below it someone has written: grief. Then someone else: life coach.\n\nHe puts the peony on his desk. It looks ridiculous. Maeve looks at it and says, \u201cI had a teacher once who used to pin silk flowers to her cardigans because she liked looking like a sofa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I look like,\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cLike a man with a flower on his desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\n\nHe sits. The paperwork rustles. The phone rings. Somewhere a door closes too hard because that is how the person feels and the door is the only thing that won\u2019t mind. He writes the dead woman\u2019s name. He writes to Katie to ask if the tag jogs a memory. He writes Rook in the margin and underlines it and does not have a theory he can call elegant.\n\nAt five, when the light outside is the colour of tea with milk left in the cup, Griggs stands by his chair and looks at the flower as if it has made a remark. \u201cWe are not a party,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Owen says, without moving.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let your\u2026 hobbies\u2026 bleed,\u201d Griggs says. \u201cYou let anything bleed enough it becomes the whole room. I don\u2019t want to stand in a room and find myself drowning in someone\u2019s embroidery.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s paper,\u201d Owen says.\n\n\u201cEverything is paper,\u201d Griggs says. \u201cUntil it burns.\u201d\n\nAfter, he goes to the river and leans on the railing like a cliche that has forgiven itself. A little group of teenagers share a bag of chips and talk about a teacher\u2019s boots as if they are a political scandal. A boy throws a stone and misses the water and looks around to see if the stone itself is going to laugh. The peony sits in a ridiculous and beloved fashion in his pocket, warm from his hand. He tries to imagine Rook sitting in a circle talking about values with a person in a sweater. He tries to imagine it with kindness. He fails, but not entirely. A gull shouts and the sky answers with a shift of grey that could be a promise or could be nothing at all.\n\nIf he is honest\u2014and he is not always\u2014he likes the feeling of the paper against his palm. He likes the way something thin as breath can be encouraged into a shape you can name. It is not control. It is not rescue. It\u2019s softer. He doesn\u2019t have a word for it yet. He tells himself language will catch up. It has to. It always does, eventually. It always does, until it doesn\u2019t.\n\nAnd in a house on Greenway Avenue a ribbon hangs from a mantle, missing its weight. And in a salvage yard called Rook & Rooke a man with a scar through his eyebrow looks at his own hands and thinks: these could be used for something that is not making doors open. And in a small room above a shop that smells of tissue and glue, a woman writes down names on a list and underlines one because she knows that people who bring their shoulders down off their ears for an hour might need a reason to come again. And in the station on Shuttern the night collects itself in the pigeonholes, as it always does, ready for the shift to change, and the town leans into the next thing the way a cyclist leans into a curve, hoping for balance, almost finding it, sometimes falling anyway.By morning the light over Greenway Avenue has the overstated politeness of a guest who has arrived too early and is trying not to rustle. The house holds still as if taught to, the kind of semi-detached that looks like it was built to accept sensible conversations and wipeable grief. They do the door again because they always do the door again, the ritual of the threshold a way of admitting there was a before and now there is an after. The hallway smells faintly of lavender polish and the breath of carpets that have known slippers. On the console table is a bowl with a handful of coins and a postcard from Weston-super-Mare showing the pier in a light so artificial it has failed into romance. The Queen Anne chair in the front room remains affronted in the way certain furniture becomes when the human story decides to do something inconvenient on its watch. The woman is still, more very asleep than anything else, except for the tiny wrongs\u2014colour, temperature, the way the spine negotiates gravity when it is done pretending to be a string attached to a kite. The peony from the mantel is in a bag now with a little card stapled and numbers that turn the word flower into a line of a report. The ribbon that once held it is hanging like a small fete that didn\u2019t come off.\n\nThe pathologist does the small, tender work that makes television lie. He does not announce a time of death like a man opening a parcel to a room of people waiting to be pleased. He looks at wrists and nails and the inside of the lips where bruises begin talking before they are noticed. He speaks in little fractions because the body at this point is a fraction of what it was. \u201cNatural,\u201d he says, and then corrects himself because precision is a form of love. \u201cProbably natural. Underlying. But there\u2019s a bruise here that wants a story. Maybe a fall. Maybe a wrist held. Maybe nothing.\u201d He looks at the left wrist and the pale blank where a watch lived its life for a long time and now is elsewhere. He doesn\u2019t write burglary. He doesn\u2019t write theft. He writes absence and leaves it for other rooms with other people to decide what absence means.\n\nMaeve does her dance through the rooms, her notebook a net that catches the fish that want to be caught and several minnows that will be let go later because scale matters. \u201cMilk in the fridge,\u201d she says in the tone she reserves for evidence hiding in plain sight. \u201cHalf a pint. Sell-by two days ago. Tea stains on two mugs. Both with lipstick\u2014one a mauve that wants to be brown and one defiant carnival pink. She didn\u2019t have guests in mauve lipstick. Or did she repaint her mouth between mugs.\u201d The bedside table holds two blister packs that have surrendered one pill each but at different hours. A knitted shawl hangs on the end of the bed like a note in a soft language. In the kitchen the radio is on at a whisper, some presenter being too cheerful for a morning that hadn\u2019t been asked to accommodate any cheer at all. On the fridge door there is a magnet with the phone number of a taxi firm and a babysitter\u2019s flyer with perforated tabs; none of the tabs have been taken, which has always felt like a quiet little sadness to Owen, as if the babysitter has been waiting in a room for years, her hair done for nothing.\n\nHouse-to-house is a choreography with tea. A neighbour in a lilac fleece does that thing where she begins a sentence with \u201cFunny thing, actually,\u201d and the funny thing is interesting but not independently capable of carrying us to a conclusion. She saw a man about a week ago who might have been a son or might have been the Internet; he brought in shopping with the way of somebody embarrassed to be holding bags. Another neighbour who has barbeque utensils in a bucket by the back door offers the idea that a white van without signage is, all white vans are, practically a confession. It isn\u2019t helpful and he will gladly repeat it to the tape recorder if asked. A woman two doors down says the dead woman used to be a teaching assistant and then became not that when her knees failed to be excited by flight of stairs, and she spent a great deal of time writing to the council about hedges becoming more than hedges. As with all people who are newly dead, the town is gently editing her into a story that sounds as if everyone involved had a plan.\n\nFamily arrive in pieces because that is how families work, one person already halfway through the day\u2019s argument, another ready to be reasonable, one with their phone as a shield and one with naked hands. The daughter, whose name is Laura and who has a council lanyard in her pocket that she touches without putting on, stands in the hallway and swallows back a year\u2019s worth of unmade calls. She is wearing a jacket that is supposed to look smart and a pair of boots that knew a much younger December. She looks at Owen as if he is an electrician who has come to mend a socket and she is embarrassed that her whole house is on fire. \u201cShe was fine,\u201d Laura says, and the word fine looks as if she has made it out of aluminium foil, pressed neat, and it is crumpling in her hands already. She names the second mug\u2019s lipstick. \u201cThat will have been Wendy. Thursdays. Wendy brings pink. Mum hates pink and drinks it anyway out of politeness.\u201d The watch gets its own little scene. \u201cMum\u2019s watch,\u201d Laura says, before the question reaches the room. \u201cShe never took it off, even in the bath. She said time was the thing that got away the fastest and she wanted to hold something that had it in.\u201d When asked if anyone would take it she blinks, offended by the verb but bound to consider it. \u201cNo. I mean\u2014who would. Maybe she put it down. Maybe she\u2014I don\u2019t know. Maybe nothing.\u201d\n\nThe tag in the bag with the peony is reproduced in Owen\u2019s head when he closes his eyes. Love K, written by a left hand pretending confidence. A list of names at Paper & Thread will be ordinary in the way that lists are. It will have Karens and Kates and a Kelly who spells it with a single l because her mother thought that looked continental. He thinks of the way Katie had said \u201cI burned my finger,\u201d and how the small change in pressure on a pen turned a letter into a different animal. He thinks he might be constructing a puppetry of coincidence because it pleases him to imagine that the world is made of handholds.\n\nAt the shop, mid-morning, tissue paper is a weather, squares being lifted and lowered like very obedient flags. The bell on the door produces its strangled finch noise and Katie looks up the way a person looks up when they know a person will be there and they have already prepared their face to receive them. He shows her a photograph of the tag taken on his phone through plastic. \u201cLeft hand K,\u201d she says immediately, in the tone of a person pointing at themselves caught in their own CCTV. \u201cI did that. Thursday, just before closing. A portly man with a wonderful tweed waistcoat and a grief that had clearly come out in the wrong order said he couldn\u2019t do the loops with his fingers and would I write it. I said what\u2019s the name and he said K, just K, make it love K, and I made a joke about James Bond\u2019s quartermaster and he didn\u2019t get it but he laughed anyway because he wanted me to feel I hadn\u2019t embarrassed both of us.\u201d She flicks past the part where she burned herself because that is not the kind of detail that wants to be centre stage. \u201cHe paid cash out of a change purse, which is adorable in a man over forty if you don\u2019t think too deeply about why, and he smelled like boiled sweets and old cigarette smoke. Hair like sheep\u2019s wool. He said the lady liked cream because it didn\u2019t show the dust.\u201d She winces because she has said lady and not woman and she thinks she might be judged, and then she sees she is not.\n\n\u201cDid he give a name for K,\u201d Owen asks, and her head shakes while she returns ribbon spools to a drawer that is trying to quarrel with her about how full it should be. She is writing the shape of the man in her mind and cannot find a detail that will be decisive without making him into a caricature. \u201cI can draw his nose,\u201d she says, and laughs because that sounds like a threat. She searches under the till for previous day\u2019s scrap paper because Paper & Thread is run on the belief that the world will keep track of small, nice things if given chance. She produces a receipt with nothing on it except a drawn loop that might have been her hand practicing the K until it was something she would be prepared to let go of. \u201cSorry. That\u2019s nothing. That\u2019s not helpful.\u201d Then she adds, \u201cHe held the peony like it was a baby hedgehog. I liked him for that. If he did wrong in your world, he didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d\n\nOutside in the blowy light you only get over the river, there is a noticeboard behind glass with fading event flyers arranging themselves into a calendar of optimism. Owen ticks through with his eyes because walls tell stories when enough of them have been used for notices. Crochet for Cancer, Wednesday nights. Mindful Parenting, first Monday. Men in Sheds, ongoing. There, between a pastel poster with a cupcake and a yoga class advertised by a woman who could hold a plank for a month, is a handbill for Clarity Coaching with Ken Wright BA (Hons), MA (PosPsych), letters like credentials that can be laid like ammunition. Find your what by finding your why, it says. Ladder your goals. Saturdays at the Quaker Meeting House, one-to-ones by appointment, be seen, be heard, be well. There is a number and a photo of a man with a smile practiced in a mirror that has been told to be honest. The initial in the name is the one that has been living in his head all morning. There are only so many K\u2019s a town can keep in stock.\n\n\u201cWhat have you got,\u201d Maeve asks when he returns, shaking rain off herself as if it is an opinion she didn\u2019t ask for. He shows her Ken Wright\u2019s face and she groans with respect. \u201cOf course he is called Ken,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a very particular kind of Ken. He has a whiteboard he wheels and a marker he treats like a wand. He says content-free sentences about journeys and sees the tears as confirmation the journey has begun. Don\u2019t make that face, Owen. I know you have recently discovered your heart is a large origami swan and you want to be kind. Ken will test you.\u201d He tells her Katie\u2019s description of the man with the tweed and the boiled sweets smell and they both conjure three different people from the description and none of them feels like the one. \u201cHe could be a choir master or the man who calibrates scales in chemists,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s either loved by a village or feared by all his grandchildren. We shouldn\u2019t be making a pantomime. But also I would pay to watch him audition for one.\u201d\n\nThe woman on Greenway Avenue acquires a name that fits her better than dead woman. Her name is Marion Vale and she used to file the library books under the wrong categories on purpose when de-shelving annoyed her because she liked the idea that someone might find a dictionary in Local History and be tempted to read it. She has a daughter Laura who would do anything for her mother and a son between jobs who is bad at Auntie cards and good at taking bins out without being asked. She has a friend Wendy who wears carnival pink and fills Thursday afternoons with gossip that is kinder than gossip pretends it will be. Marion has a watch that is missing and a peony that is a curiosity, and a bruise on the wrist that refuses to pick a team. Owen and Maeve sit with Laura in the little conservatory that was never quite sure why it was added and drink tea that tastes like it has been asked to make a point. \u201cThere was a man,\u201d Laura says, as if bringing something to a table and apologising for the size. \u201cNot a man like a story ought to have. A man like an envelope. He came two weeks ago with a leaflet. Mum said he was a very smooth person. He told her talking helps and she told him to sell his talk where the talk-hungry are.\u201d She looks at the leaflet on the sideboard and pushes it towards them with one finger, reluctant to touch it twice. Ken Wright\u2019s overly sincere face looks up from its gloss. The initial sits there as if it had applied to be in their afternoon and had been accepted. \u201cHe had that notepad,\u201d Laura says, \u201cthe slim one like you have if you are trying to look like you are not taking notes but you are taking notes. He looked at Mum\u2019s hands as if he was going to tell them to relax. She didn\u2019t like that at all.\u201d\n\nBy the time they reach the Quaker Meeting House the afternoon looks grey in the way a dishcloth looks grey after enthusiasm has been taken from it. The board outside says There is something of God in everyone, in careful temporary letters you can wipe off with a damp cloth if the world complains too loudly. Ken Wright arrives between one breath and the next, wearing a jacket the colour of wet cardboard and shoes that are new enough to have just a little retail shop in them still. He is shorter than his photo would like him to be and his smile has borrowed something from the way doctors smile in dramas just before giving either excellent or terrible news.\n\n\u201cOfficers,\u201d he says, and the word has the game-show flourish of a man who learned to include people by naming them. \u201cCome to find your why.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome to find your Ken,\u201d Maeve says, and he does a laugh that shows the effort he is willing to make for strangers to feel charming. He is not unpleasant on purpose. He is rehearsed and that is its own kind of warning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking about contact with Marion Vale,\u201d Owen says. \u201cTwo weeks ago you were in her house. We know because the universe has a habit of telling on us with bits of paper.\u201d\n\nKen does his serious-man face, the one he thinks will reassure them that he keeps his heart in a responsible place. \u201cI run a group for the bereaved,\u201d he says, \u201camong other things. I do workplaces and couples and grief and getting up in the morning and the midlife thirty-six-hour stare. Marion called me a twit which is a word I have a lot of time for, and I said I accept that designation, and then we talked about hedges for fifteen minutes. She asked if I was going to charge her for the hedges chat. I said no, because I\u2019m not a bastard.\u201d He looks at Owen as if to gauge whether bastard is the kind of word he can say in this conversation. Owen\u2019s face does not contradict him but does not give him encouragement to add a stronger one. \u201cI did not sell her anything,\u201d Ken continues. \u201cShe did not want me to exist in her week.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you know she died,\u201d Maeve asks, two beats late to stop him framing his answer to another, less solemn question. His mouth opens to do the oh no face and his forehead remembers it has muscles for that. Even if it is performance, it is conscientious performance. \u201cI saw something on the Facebook group for the street,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t do Facebook but my assistant compiles a digest because people gossip where they live. Terrible. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t think\u2014obviously we need to think\u2014but I don\u2019t think my chat about hedges did it.\u201d\n\nOwen finds he wants not to dislike him and then becomes suspicious of that wanting as if it is an advert trying to sell him bread he already has. \u201cDo you know a gentleman,\u201d he says, \u201cof an age to have bought a small change purse and an inclination to admit it in public. Tweed waistcoat. Sheep wool hair. Smelt of boiled sweets he does not share. Bought a paper flower from a shop and asked for it to be labelled \u2018Love K\u2019.\u201d\n\nKen does three small expressions to process the many details he has been handed. He is good at this; he has sat in rooms where people have thrown the contents of their day at his face and he has had to find the thread that would make them feel stitched into their own lives. \u201cMr. Kettle,\u201d he says, and looks quietly proud of his memory. \u201cHe comes to my Tuesday mornings and tells me to stop calling him Mr. Kettle because it makes him feel like a black-and-white kitchen. Kevin Kettle, but nobody calls him Kevin because he is perfectly made for his surname. He does indeed wear tweed in seasons that do not require it and he has the sugar habit you have observed. He has a pocket full of barley sugar, I swear he does it because it makes him feel like a Victorian who\u2019s allowed to take tigers on walks. He looks after a woman called Elsie who is his neighbour and who has an awful habit of falling over in shops. He is always doing love Ks because he thinks first names are intimate and last names are rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould Mr. Kettle buy a flower for Marion Vale,\u201d Owen asks, and Ken tilts his head like a dog who has been asked why, philosophically, fetch is relevant to the human condition. \u201cHe does gifts,\u201d Ken says. \u201cHe is the kind of person who, when a pain happens in a radius of streets around him, puts a small object in the pain\u2019s immediate vicinity to make it feel like the world has noticed. His ethics are fine if this is about ethics. He is a man with a key to many people\u2019s houses and nobody has ever had the key cut back to a single because they mind. He will have done the bin for her without telling her. He will have fixed her doorbell and then told her it was a fairy. Please don\u2019t kick him for being helpful. I know helpful can also be a mask. But with him it is not a mask that wants to be a thief.\u201d\n\nMaeve and Owen exchange a look that is not a decision but is the prelude to one. They will knock on Mr. Kettle\u2019s door with biscuits because certain men need nine minutes of chat before a question will sit in the room without making them proud. They will see the barley sugars rolled into the corner of a drawer and they will see a little saucer for coins by the key stand and they will think indecently that it is nice to be right when it doesn\u2019t cost anyone.\n\nThey go anyway to Rook & Rooke because there is a drum in Owen\u2019s chest that plays Silas even when the orchestra has been told to pack up. The salvage yard smells of damp paint and the iron in blood and sometimes of a lost fry-up. Silas is not at the front; he never is when a polite conversation would suit everyone concerned. He is somewhere in his labyrinth of municipal chairs and radiators that wanted one more life. A boy with a face like a church step looks up from an angle grinder with the solemn intensity of someone who has just learned what an angle is. \u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d the boy says, which is nearly always true and therefore always suspicious. Owen walks farther in because there is a degree to which waiting for Silas in his own rooms is like asking a trickster to send you a postcard.\n\nHe appears with a piece of brass in one hand that looks like it came from a ship that sank for a very dramatic reason. He does a look that is almost shy and then forgets to make it into arrogance. \u201cHave you seen my watch,\u201d he says, pleased to revisit an old line, and Owen doesn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of giving him the history he wants. \u201cDo you know Ken Wright,\u201d he asks, and Silas laughs as if asked whether he knows electricity. \u201cHe told me to breathe,\u201d Rook says. \u201cImagine. Someone had to tell me to do that. I told him I like to outsource the regular jobs. He wrote the word outsized by mistake and kept it. He has a whiteboard like your colleague guesses, the quiet one with the hands who could probably make a swan out of a receipt and make the swan think about its life choices. Is he in your book. Is Ken a suspect. He\u2019d love that. He\u2019d word-cloud himself to death.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go to his group,\u201d Owen says. \u201cSaturdays.\u201d\n\n\u201cI go where biscuits are,\u201d Rook says. \u201cI go because I have an enquiring mind. He tells us to do body scans which is a very silly name for closing your eyes and noticing that your shoulders do not live at the tops of your ears. My shoulders are renting extra rooms in my skull. He told me to let them out and I told him my deposit was non-returnable.\u201d He puts the brass on the table with the carefulness of a man who has held objects that were once valuable to someone else and cannot forget that fact however hard he tries to style it out. \u201cYou worried you cannot like a man who tells other men to breathe,\u201d he asks, and Owen feels too seen for a second and resents it. \u201cI am worried,\u201d Owen says, and it is a considered sentence, \u201cabout people collecting other people\u2019s need and spending it badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a policeman,\u201d Rook says. \u201cYou live in that economy.\u201d\n\nThere are days when he does not entirely know why he doesn\u2019t hit Silas Rook in the face and then remember. Hitting him would be an admission that his sentences are objects you can catch and he is not going to juggle on Silas\u2019s stage. He says that they have a man named Kettle on their list to talk to and watches Silas\u2019s eyebrows take the information and file it under Not Immediately Useful to Me. Rook picks imaginary fluff from his sleeve and does the thing where he flips the conversation into a joke that wants to be an exit. \u201cYou\u2019re making peonies now,\u201d he says. \u201cIt suits you. Something about your mouth looks less like it is holding an alarm between its teeth. I like it when men do pretty things and do not apologise for being alive while doing them. Bring one to my yard and I\u2019ll try not to set fire to it to make a point.\u201d\n\nThe appointment with Mr. Kettle is half an hour of happiness disguised as a lecture on grids. He has a doormat that says Not Today and a collection of Victorian Cyanide Poison warnings framed in the loo because he says it reminds him not to put the wrong thing in anyone else\u2019s tea. He is the kind of man who calls Owen \u201cmy dear fellow\u201d and actually means dear and fellow in some old kind way. There are sweets in every room in little pressed glass bowls that have known many Christmases and have probably survived a house move like soldiers. He proudly shows them his change purse that has a snap you cannot buy anymore, he says, unless you know a woman called Beryl who deals in these things and is likely to outlive them all. He has the need to explain why he writes Ks when he does not know if he has been accused of anything. \u201cKevin,\u201d he says, and his cheeks do a flutter that is nearly a blush. \u201cI don\u2019t like Kevin. It has always made me feel like I am about to be called to the front of a class to spell something I already know I cannot spell. So K. Love K. It\u2019s ridiculous at my age but also life is ridiculous at my age and therefore there is a compatibility.\u201d He bought the peony for Marion last week, he says, because she was cross about hedges and there is no better treatment for hedge crossness than a thing that is aggressively not a hedge. He handed it to Wendy because Wendy likes to be the bringer. He has never been in Marion\u2019s house without permission and not even then because he doesn\u2019t like to catch people in their rooms with their mouths unbraced.\n\nHe speaks about Ken with the resigned affection of a man who has accepted a doctor for an ailment he isn\u2019t sure he has. \u201cHe tells me I should stop collecting people\u2019s shopping trolleys,\u201d he says. \u201cHe says I cannot push everyone\u2019s trolley to the coin return, and I say I can, and then the next week I bring him a tally. He is trying to be kind. He does it in a tone that reminds me of small sermons, but he does not take your money while he does it unless you give it with both hands, which I do, because I like a room where the tea is hot and nothing is thrown.\u201d He has no beef with anyone alive, and yet he carries himself like a man who has been armed with a sense of duty since he was nine. It is hard to file that under suspect and then it is irresponsible to file it under harmless; men who seem like saucers can carry knives like anyone else.\n\nThe day does that settling down thing where the town puts on the lights it can afford and hopes the rest will make its own arrangements. The paperwork is a tide coming in behind him and Owen allows himself to be stood in it up to the knees because if you pretend there is no water it still wets you. He puts the peony from the class on the shelf above his desk where past him used to put a football scarf in winter and a postcard from a seafront showing a painted donkey. Griggs passes by, sees the flower, opens his mouth to make a remark and then closes it again because the effort of forming the remark and the probable satisfaction once said will not pay for the ugliness it will leave afterwards. He says instead that Priorswood will want a visit because the copper pipe turned out to belong to a church undergoing a re-plumb and you cannot mess with churches even if you are a pagan about plumbing. On the whiteboard someone has added Paper K in green and someone else has put a question mark next to it that is so emphatic it has probably bruised the pen nib. The station smells of the coffee that has been made strong to prove a point and a portion of chips that has vanished in the time it takes to turn a wheel. The night men filter in with faces like people who have been told the punchline and are trying to frame their day as a setup that will justify it.\n\nAt home he does a strange thing that feels like cheating on the person he was last year. He clears a space on the table that most people would consider to be already empty and lays out tissue paper in squares like siding tiles on a house he will never own. His hands have learned to do the pinching without thinking but still require him to be present, which is a luxury. He teaches himself a leaf from a drawing he can find on the internet but doesn\u2019t because he has decided that it is possible to invent if you are willing to fail at something someone else could teach you in six minutes. The radio is a mumble in the corner and a man says the words of the day as if he is in charge of deciding what they mean. Owen makes three leaves that all look like they have been on different trees, which is fine with him because if they had agreed with each other it would have been a small lie. He puts the flower he never will give to his mother on the table with a new friend and the table does not notice, which is right, because he would like some things not to be enormous in the way that the world thinks they ought to be.\n\nHe does not sleep as a verb; he sleeps as a negotiation. His dream is a lecture hall with a craft table at the front, and he is required to stand and make peonies while explaining a case and every time he says the word motive the paper tears. He wakes in the grey that is not quite morning and goes to the window to watch the river not be about him, which is a discipline and a relief. A text from Maeve arrives with a photo of a leaflet for the Clarity group with the note: your boyfriend Ken is doing a weekend retreat. Do not attend unless you want to be told to tell your inner policeman to relax. He writes back that his inner policeman is too busy knitting and she sends an emoji that she would tell her nephew not to use.\n\nHe meets Katie again without meaning to because the town keeps its people like a handful of pebbles you think you have thrown and then find again in the pocket of an old coat. She is outside Paper & Thread chalking a sandwich board with a hand that can do italics without arrogance. She is writing, today: we are open and not in a hurry. Her hair has committed to being in the knot that it became by accident yesterday. He tells her about Marion in the edge-of-the-news way that he knows how to do now, careful to keep the details that would pull her into a room he can\u2019t close for her. \u201cWe have a Mr. Kettle,\u201d he says, and she brightens at the name as if she has been told a story she was already ready to enjoy. \u201cHe came in yesterday and asked me if I had a ribbon that looks like it knows how to behave itself,\u201d she says. \u201cI told him not a one. He bought the worst behaved ribbon I have and said excellent, that\u2019s what I like in a person.\u201d\n\nIf the world were the kind of world where you could smell coincidence, he would at this point have to sneeze. It is a small place. People like Ken identify the smallness and sell it back to you as intimacy. People like Silas exploit it as a map they can draw in versions that suit them. People like Mr. Kettle make it an economy of kindness. People like Marion live in it and ask it to be practical. People like Owen walk through it with heavy keys and try to keep all the doors honourably on their hinges.\n\nAt midweek there is a new event that is not dramatic in the way the newspaper likes to be fed but is the sort of thing that makes the strings on the map in the briefing room want to tug. There is a night-time taking-attempt from the back room of Paper & Thread and it is not the till, which is what you take when you are not acquainted with a person\u2019s looking. It is the boxes of wire and the good glue gun that has a chrome bit on it as if one day it knew what it was like to be a car. The lock is prised with an intelligence that is not refined but is confident. On the floor in the mess of tissue and ribbon is a shoe print that is a half-moon of bossing from a brand that sells itself on young men believing their ankles are doing something important. The world is like that\u2014a man will spend on ankle drama what he might not spend on lunch. Katie is shaken in the way of a person who finds the place where she keeps her sleep disturbed. She wants to tidy while talking and folds paper while worrying, which is like rain explaining itself.\n\n\u201cWhy take wire,\u201d Maeve asks out loud as if the wire might develop a conscience in response and arrange a return. Katie\u2019s answer is both craft and town. \u201cThe wedding over the weekend,\u201d she says, \u201cthe one at the rugby club with the backdrop that lights up, the lads used all my stock last-minute because the first lot went missing in the van crash. They told me I should be grateful because they paid cash, as if cash makes everything into a better story. I think someone saw me write down that I would order more and thought if I order and it arrives before I am here then this is the kind of shop that will prop its door with a broom and hope the world is good. Maybe someone wanted to try their hand at bending things. People like to play God with wire. It does the thing you want at speed, which is dangerous.\u201d\n\nInside that answer is a small shape Owen turns with his mind like a coin. Wire from a craft shop is cleaner and more predictable than the scrap at Rook\u2019s, which is a tangle of old fences and bits of bedsprings and something that once held a sign that said SLOW near a school. If he were to be a person with ambition for making a different thing that looks like a thing that ought not to exist, he would buy his wire new. He would want regularity, obedient length. He would want the cut to be clean. He does not say it because it is not yet a thought that has anywhere to sit. He logs the shoe print, he notes the lock, he tells Katie to get a camera that isn\u2019t insulting to the future and she says she already has one and it is cheerful yellow which is a choice she has made with hope.\n\nThat evening he takes Maeve to the Ken meeting because anything done with a witness is less likely to become an anecdote with sharp teeth. The Quaker room is all the calm you would give a person if they were afraid of today. The chairs are laid in a semi-circle less because semi-circles are optimal for learning and more because the person laying them wanted to feel less like they were arranging a jury. Ken writes on his whiteboard slowly as if afraid his pen will feel used, and his words are saying nothing new and managing to be what some people need and that contradiction is chewable if you don\u2019t mind the taste. Silas is there in the back making a face like a schoolboy and choosing not to hide from himself. Mr. Kettle is at the front with his hands on his knees and his absence of need arranged in a shape that will not frighten anyone. There is a woman who is trying not to be the crying person and a man who is too busy telling his own story in his head to hear anyone else\u2019s. There are biscuits and the least haughty tea he has tasted in a week and a poster that says today\u2019s you is okay. Ken says things about breath and noticing and the three-minute vacation you can give yourself if you sit in your car and listen to traffic without making any of it your fault. The part of Owen that mistrusts being told to notice things when he notices things for a living is belligerent. The part of him that has been doing pelmanism with Silas under the table for a decade relaxes anyway when someone else is allowed to say a sentence that is a soft landing. Maeve watches with the intent of a person who is going to take the piss later and then will make him bacon in the morning because she wants good outcomes.\n\nAfter, when coats find their arms and chairs return to their little lines, Ken tries a question as if trying a new tie. \u201cWhat do you do when you are not making sure we are not parts of a riot,\u201d he asks Owen, and the room manages that paradoxical attention where everyone is being polite about not looking and everyone wants to hear the answer. He says, \u201cI make paper peonies,\u201d because there is freedom in being ridiculous on purpose and he finds that he wants to root his week in something that isn\u2019t a filing system and a siren. The room breathes out in laughter that is not about him and he likes it for that. Silas says, \u201cOh good,\u201d and Ken, to his credit, doesn\u2019t turn it into a prompt about softness. He writes the word hobby on the board and then rubs a bit of it out absentmindedly and leaves hobb, and Owen watches the word more keenly than is sensible because it looks like a thing from a fairy story.\n\nBack in the street the night has decided what kind of dark it wants to be and it is the hospitable one with enough lamps. Owen can feel the case putting out little roots now, bits that will either make a plant given space and time or will die in the soil and nourish other worries. He has a Mr. Kettle who is a conduit. He has a Ken who gathers and therefore knows. He has a Katie who is in the vulnerable category of person you want to be friends with your whole life. He has a Silas learning to breathe in a group and making that fact make a noise. He has a watch-shaped nothing and the faintest whisper of a bruise. He has paper, which is silly and also ought not to be dismissed because sometimes the silly is the thing that makes the room bearable enough to do the serious.\n\nOn his way home, just for the satisfaction that being in motion brings, he cuts across the bus station and the weather is doing the thing with its sleeves again, rolling them up like it means to get involved. A boy is making aimless shapes with his bike and he is the kind of boy who has invented a way of making eye contact that doesn\u2019t risk it. It takes a second to recognise him without the posture of errands and a message, but then it is Aiden, shoes less white now, fewer sharp lines. He sees Owen and decides in an instant not to be someone else for the purposes of this conversation. \u201cThat thing the other day,\u201d he says instead of hello, and he means the five boys and the bins and the relief disguised as shouting. \u201cMy mum said if I see you to tell you she liked that you didn\u2019t say feral. She said a lot of people like that word too much. She says feral is a cat, not a person. She said,\u201d and he has to push this next bit out because he is sixteen and kind and the combination burns, \u201cshe said to tell you she is a person and it was a bad day and if you see her she will not run.\u201d Owen nods and says tell her I said sorry for the day being bad. Aiden leans on the bike like it feels like furniture he brought from home. \u201cI got a job,\u201d he says, which is not true, not yet, but it is an intention that is wearing boots. \u201cAt the yard. Not heavy work. Tidy work. Sorting work. The bald man said he would teach me the names of woods and I could maybe not steal them after if I know them. He\u2019s funny. He says he\u2019ll make a church boy of me. I don\u2019t know what that is. Do you.\u201d Owen thinks of Silas in the back of a Quaker room pretending to have invented breath and he laughs, and the night looks at him in a surprised way and does not report him to anyone for enjoying something.\n\nWhen he gets home, because the day has not finished and it will not until he decides to let it, he takes the peony from the shelf and attaches one of the leaves he made badly and the leaf sits there like a joke that landed anyway. He writes Marion\u2019s name in his book with care as if by writing it the right way he is paying a fee he has owed to the day. He writes Kettle, Ken, Katie, Rook, peony\u2014class\u2014and the act of putting the words near each other brings with it a small fizz, as if he has shaken something carbonated and now must decide whether to open it or leave it overnight to quieten. He writes watch and underlines it because watches mark you if you let them. Before sleep he texts Maeve: do not let Ken make me write my feelings on a post-it. She replies: he can\u2019t afford the amount of post-it that would require. He goes to bed and in the hour where he usually listens to the pipes practice their rhythms, he hears, very faintly, the town, leaning into a curve and getting around it with only a small wobble, and that, for one night, is enough.Chapter Five\n\nBy morning the river is wearing a scarf of its own breath and the town has put on its weekday face, the one with the quicker shoes. Owen stands with his coat half on and watches the rain make punctuation marks on the station\u2019s steps, commas and ellipses that can be read as either encouragement or delay depending on the reader. Maeve arrives with coffee that has considered being coffee and decided to remain an implication; she hands it over like a conspirator and shrugs out of her hood with the affronted dignity of a cat. Griggs passes through the foyer with a folder under his arm which is the shape all his optimism takes, and says in the general direction of everyone that the pathologist\u2019s preliminary says probably natural for Marion Vale and definitely inconvenient for the paperwork, then adds to the room at large that the watch is still a noun with no adjective and he would appreciate people going out into the world and supplying one.\n\nThey begin with the obvious because the obvious is not stupid until you have proved it is. Wendy lives in a terrace with a front garden that is more ornaments than soil, a collection of ceramic frogs that all have opinions. She wears her carnival pink in daylight the way some people carry a torch, to make dark corners belong to them, and she welcomes them in with the sort of energy that tells you she has already cried and is trying on three substitutes to see which will keep the day aloft. The house is middle-of-the-week tidy, which is to say the dishes are done and the cushions are behaving but nobody has performed theatre for strangers. She talks without being asked for a bit because silence is a muscle you have to warm up for, and when she is ready she says she took the peony last Thursday because it looked like luxury you could put your thumb through, and she put it on the mantel and made a joke about it being the one flower Marion would never kill by forgetting water. She says Marion told her off for the ribbon being a bit much and then stroked the ribbon with two fingers like a person remembering a skirt she once had that swished.\n\nThey do the hour with Wendy in a way that makes time behave. She puts two mugs out and adds sugar without asking because it is easier to be told off for generosity than to anticipate the needs of strangers, and she sits and tries to picture Thursday in a way that will please them. She remembers the weather being the kind that cannot commit and the delivery man frustrated by his own existence and Marion\u2019s mouth set in a line that meant the council had annoyed her into eloquence. She does not remember the watch coming off because she never saw the watch off in ten years of Thursdays, which is a fact that hangs in the room like a polite ghost. There was a man at the door just before she left, she says, and then grimaces because that has the shape of plot when she is only telling them about a man who wanted to clear gutters and spoke as if he wanted to be believed as a career. He had a jacket in that particular hi-vis that looks tired even when new, and he had a clipboard you could have made at home. She told him she did the gutters personally up a ladder in heels and he said she was a card, and she said what kind of card, and he did not have the wit to answer, and she closed the door on his usefulness. It was ten to four, ish, because she had to pick up her granddaughter at four and she is a woman who watches the edges of hours.\n\nThey check the street\u2019s camera as if asking a wall to present a memory and the wall tries, offering them a slice of world with the colour taken down a notch. There is a van that could be any van and a man who could be a hundred men, the sort of shape that the universe produces when it is tired of people and wants only silhouettes. He walks quickly because walking slowly invites chat, and his hood is up not because of weather but because anonymity is a habit. They can\u2019t see his face and they can\u2019t see his clipboard and still a feeling moves across both of them at the same time, the feeling you get when life repeats itself in little, irritating ways. Halcon had a man with a clipboard who knew the sound a tin of meter coins makes even through a cupboard door and had a way of being as domesticated as a wolf can look through glass.\n\nOn the way back they stop in a shop that deals in things the previous generation used to call valuables and now we have learned to call sentimental because only one of those names pays. The pawnbroker has glasses that have seen everything and refuse to be impressed by it twice, and he leans on the counter and makes them a world-weary cup of tea without offering milk because he has learned to be a neutral host. The description of Marion\u2019s watch is too precise to be interesting\u2014it is the kind of watch that tells the time and disapproves of novelty\u2014and he listens like a man who likes a story even if he cannot sell it. He shakes his head and then says a thing that is not no, not exactly; a man brought in a watch yesterday that had a back engraved, and pawnbrokers do not love engraved things because they carry too much biography. The man made a face when he was told the engraving made it a problem of belonging, and the man had the particular angry carefulness of someone who wants to appear not angry. He had a beard that wished it was an argument and a jacket that once belonged to a better man. He gave the name Dave because of course he did and left the watch in a pocket as if it was the sort of pocket that doesn\u2019t make things more complicated the longer they stay.\n\nThey do the rounds of the scrap-yards and the small shops where cash still behaves like a cousin you can borrow things from, and the watch has not presented itself like a dog that knows its own name. It is an absence that keeps being itself. On a side street just past the barbers that calls itself a lounge, Maeve slows to look at a poster for Chair Yoga with a woman sitting in a chair like a person who has decided elegance can compromise if it wants to. \u201cShe teaches on Thursdays,\u201d she says, and she points with her chin because her hands are busy with a thought. \u201cThe hall two minutes from Greenway. If Marion wasn\u2019t for Ken with his whiteboard she might have been for a woman who offers to move with your bones rather than against them.\u201d It is nothing more than weather until it is something else, and they put it on a mental list because their physical lists already insist they are at capacity.\n\nBack at Paper & Thread, the aftershock of the attempted break-in is still in the room like someone\u2019s breath, a temperature change and an untucked corner. Katie has done the thing a certain kind of person does when shaken by the way the world insists on being itself; she has arranged everything more perfectly than yesterday, as if kindness to objects can talk the air out of a bad mood. The lock is a new lock because she has a friend who is a locksmith or is in love with one, and the camera at the back is now a little yellow bird with a black pupil, brighter than anything else in the alley. She does not ask for an update on Marion because she is afraid that an update turns you into the sort of person who is entitled to one, and that is not who she wants to be. She asks instead about the shoe print, and when they tell her it is a brand of trainer that smells of lunchtime fights and birthday money, she nods because she knows it was a child-man and she knows how children wear menace like an oversized coat.\n\nOwen kneels and fixes the cable run for the camera with the kind of carefulness he gives to everyday things he respects and sometimes forgets to respect. He asks about the order that went missing for the rugby club and she snorts and says the lads wanted to build a backdrop that made the room forget what it was, and when one of them knocked her card machine off the counter with his enormous romance she made them pay in notes. He asks without asking if anyone new has been interested in wire and she says yes, a man with not a lot of hair and an interest in his own elbows came in two days ago and asked how much wire it would take to make a forest, which is the kind of thing men who want to test you say, and she said depends on your trees. He didn\u2019t buy anything because he was there to learn how to speak her language and left with three words and a picture of the till in his head. It is not Silas because Katie would have said Silas; she is a woman who uses names like stepping stones when she crosses a stream.\n\nIn the afternoon they sit at their hot desk purgatory and eat things that insist they were food based on paperwork alone. The pathologist rings to say the bruise on the wrist is a shy thing that cannot quite decide what it wants to be when it grows up. It is small and oblong and in the place where watch straps pinch if a hand is snatched without courtesy, which is not proof but is a story a person can tell themselves about a last carefulness that became an indignity. He says there is nothing of hand on mouth and nothing of knee in a bad place and nothing that demands anyone be led away for a dramatic conversation with the custody desk. He says also that hearts are manufactories and they stop without warning when components get old under fluorescent lights, and that is not poetry and not not-poetry either.\n\nThey go and see Chair Yoga because the day has decided to be themed. The hall smells like tea and dust as if it has been faithful to an era longer than any of its users, and a row of women in cardigans that resemble clouds are doing very small things with their spines while a voice tells them they are doing magnificently. The instructor is younger than the women and older than the girls who will replace her, and she has the patience of someone who has watched people be furious with their own backs and forgiven them for it. She remembers Marion because Marion said the chair was a friend who had become boring and she was trying to be kind to a boring friend. She remembers Marion wearing the watch and tapping its face as if intimidating time into agreeing to behave, and she remembers no gutters man in that hour because the hall has a noticeboard where such men leave their leaflets, and she personally rips them down and gives them to the school for cutting out because the children do not care for scams yet. She knows Wendy because of course she does and she says of Wendy that she is a good weather system in a cold room.\n\nAt the Meeting House Ken is holding a one-to-one with a man who looks like a wardrobe whose shelves are overloaded, and he catches Owen\u2019s eye in the way of someone who would like to be seen to be helpful. They speak alleys and gutters with the shorthand of two people who have become temporary colleagues in a theatre where neither of them owns the stage. Ken tells him that three of his old ladies have had visitors lately with talk of water damage that is less about water and more about entering. He says he wrote down a plate number badly because he does his best thinking in loops and straight lines frighten him, and he offers the paper in his pocket that has two possible eights and a five that could be an S. There\u2019s a small satisfaction in being the recipient of someone else\u2019s care, even if it is chaotic care, and Owen takes the paper as if it is a guinea pig.\n\nSilas is not at the yard and not in the places where he likes to be seen being not, and when Owen does catch him he is on the river path doing nothing with his arms, which for Silas is a performance. They walk side by side as if it had been arranged and avoid looking like they are avoiding the looking. Owen mentions the gutter men and Rook sucks his teeth because he hates amateurs who think a disguise is a fluorescent jacket. He says there is a cousin-cousin with a van who does legitimate roof work and an illegitimate tendency to let his friends borrow credibility in exchange for forever owing him sausages. He says he will ask without making it look like a policeman asked through him and he will report back whether there is any love in that lineage. He says the thing about watches is not time, it is that they are small and gold-looking and a certain kind of boy thinks that makes them coins with faces. He says he will return to Ken to be told to slow down his jaw and he will consider chewing each mouthful for a county-approved number of times and he will probably lie and reduce it by three.\n\nThe pawnshop rings just before five and the man with the glasses that do not get excited twice says the beard has returned and is now calling itself Gary because Dave is a name that gets used up quickly in these types. He says the watch is now in a different pocket and the beard has learned to say his girlfriend gave it to him, which is a sentence that is supposed to plug moral holes and somehow never once has. They go and the beard is the sort of beard that has become a shelter for a face that wants to be older, and the man attached to it has the twitchy kindness of a person who will apologise even when he has been robbed. He says he found the watch under a bench in Goodlands Park while throwing a ball for a dog with one ear and he says this too quickly for belief to be an option. He introduces the dog\u2019s name as if that helps and the dog is called Nigel, which is either a lie so grand it deserves applause or proof there is a God of small comic touches.\n\nThey take the watch and the man because evidence must be accompanied by a narrative, and the back of the watch says To M, time keeps us honest and the date is a summer from before whoever you are was born. Laura comes to the station because someone should be the person who says oh and then yes and then something untranslatable, and she holds the watch like it is both a crime scene and a photograph. The relief on her face is difficult even to be near because it disguises two other feelings as itself, fear and guilt, and Owen watches her swallow and wants the moment to pass only because it would be indecent to stand there and make a snack of it. She says she will keep it and he says keep it until we say differently and she nods with that dazed compliance good people have when the systems that take days from them also sometimes return a thing.\n\nThere is a list in the office now with a heading written in a hand Maeve uses when she has decided she will not be ashamed of her own neatness: DOOR MEN. Beneath are notes that could belong to a school play if they didn\u2019t matter. Van possibly white. Plate possibly two 8s. Jackets that glow like a hazard conceived by an accountant. No logo or logo you can peel off. Patience limited by weather. They add to it as the hours present new fragments; Mr. Kettle texted to say Elsie had a caller who offered to check batteries in smoke alarms, which is a new script that needs rehearsing. Ken sent an email with three bullet points though Owen does not approve of bullet points in principle: trust your doubt, ask for ID, ring a number you already know. Griggs passes the room, reads the list, and makes a face like he has bitten a grape that presented as sweet and turned herbal. He says good and then ruins it by asking if the watch is going to come with an alibi and then adds that he expects the press to want to commemorate the retrieved sentiment out of all proportion to its utility.\n\nThat night Owen goes to Katie\u2019s because he is carrying the residue of everybody\u2019s afternoon and some rooms are good at taking residue and turning it back into air. She has an evening class for small hands, which comes with a kind of noise he tires of and misses in the same breath, and she moves through the room with an attention that is the exact width of each person\u2019s day. Ro is there because Min cannot say no to a boy with a new word in his pocket and the word today is structure, which he likes because it is both a thing you can touch and a thing you can pretend to understand. They make flowers that have little paper insects tucked between petals because this is how happiness hides, and Ro tells him he has written a story where a bee hides in a rose because the bee is frightened of being famous, and Owen says remind me never to be your bee because I would not survive the attention, and Ro says it is fine, the bee gets to go to Minehead and have a look at the edge.\n\nThey talk about nothing and everything, the way you do when doing with your hands frees your mouth from proving it is clever. Katie tells him about a customer who asked for a sympathy bouquet that wasn\u2019t funereal because she wanted the room to feel like an apology rather than a wake, and she tells him about glue brands as if brands are football teams, and she tells him about having burned her finger again because some people\u2019s competence is professional and their humanity is clumsy and both are required in a room. He tells her about the watch and about Goodlands Park and Nigel the one-eared liar and she laughs with the sort of laughter that is relief performing a waltz. He doesn\u2019t tell her about the bruise because he does not want to give her wrists a story they will then carry for two days.\n\nOn the way home he passes the bus station again because it has become almost a route he trusts even when the town bends. Aiden is not there because a good day for Aiden would mean he is where he said he would be, and Owen lets himself believe in good days because his job only costs him entirely when he forgets they exist. Outside the Castle Hotel a couple argue quietly in the careful tones of polite society who have mislaid their poise, and a man in a long coat that is not a choice stands in the doorway and smokes in a way that says he would quite like to be a better version of himself and is waiting to be given permission. A gull does the noise that will not be improved upon by any God and a small group of teenagers decide to pretend they are not cold as the evening throws down its mildness like a damp towel.\n\nHe sleeps in a way that would not pass assessment and wakes too early, which is a habit he has broken and resumed more times than he has visited the optician. He walks to his window and the river is available but refuses to be about him still, which is what he pays it for, and the lights hold the bridge like jewellery and the jogger who passes is one of those men who runs like he is smiling and Owen forgives him for it. In the kitchen he peels the sticker off a new pack of tissue paper with ceremonial slowness because nobody is going to give him a ribbon to cut and yet rituals help, and he folds until the part of his mind that writes sentences about risk and harm is tired enough to sleep again. He makes two leaves that are finally cousins and not strangers and he places them next to the peony that has become the week\u2019s lit candle.\n\nThe next day begins with a van stop because sometimes coincidence will reward you if you kick it in the shins. Pond calls from Roman Road with a voice that belongs in a slightly older policeman and says we have a van that is either white or it would be if it was not acquainted with rural life and a plate that has more eights than is strictly beautiful. They go and the van is what vans are\u2014a mess of paperwork that is never what you want and sandwich remains\u2014and the two men inside are versions of a man that a town like this produces when it wants doorways to have to work harder. They do the polite work and then the unapologetic work and there are clipboards that do not have logos and leaflets that say things illiterate printers have made uglier. The men are wearing the expression of people who consider their job to be a kind of service and the universe to be their consenting customer.\n\nThe worry is that this is not dramatic enough to be a plot and dramatic enough to bruise a week. They take details that will be misremembered and bettered in the retelling and they tell the men to stop doing the thing they are doing and the men say what thing is that and they say the thing with old women who would like to die without being talked at by people with fake safety vests. They issue the piece of paper that carries what little it can carry and they watch the men become the kind of angry that is mostly relieved at being told by someone in a proper coat to stop rehearsing being a wolf. When they return to the station there is the peculiar satisfaction of having made a small dent in a hallway of dents, and there is the familiar irritation of having to write it down without being able to say we did a thing that counts, we might have stopped a bruise.\n\nBy the end of the week, Marion\u2019s watch has a chain of custody that would satisfy a pedant and a small parade of people have put their head round the station door to say a sentence that begins with at least, as if they have been deputised by hope to do post. The bruise remains noncommittal and the peony remains evidence of nothing but a world where kindness and glue share a shelf. Griggs gives them a noise that, for him, is encouraged and tells them to keep their eyes on Rook because Rook is a weather map printed in someone else\u2019s ink. Maeve tells Owen to sleep and then tells him she knows he cannot because his eyes have that polished look, and she leaves a packet of crisps on his desk with a note that says for when the vending machine disrespects you.\n\nOn Saturday he goes to the class because he has promised his hands that if they do weekday duty they will be let off the leash for ninety minutes in a room where nothing has to be solved. The table is full of people who have discovered that folding is a form of prayer that allows blasphemy, and Katie has put a small jug of jonquils by the biscuits because she is not afraid to mix paper with real, as if to say they are friends. Greg is there and tells him about caulking with a seriousness that suggests caulking saved his life once, and Min listens to Ro explain photosynthesis to his own flower and nods like a scientist. They work and do the sort of talking that makes rooms safe; there is gossip about a hen night that required diplomatic intervention and there is a kindness left anonymously for someone whose dog is about to do the brave thing and there is one brief moment where a woman looks at nothing as if something has just left her, and Katie is in front of her with a cup before the group has even noticed.\n\nAt clean-up, whilst the tissue is being told off for being everywhere, Katie finds a scrap in the corner under the table that has been trodden into something resembling a message. It is a torn bit of a leaflet with only two letters and an arrow on it, and it can belong to any advert because arrows and letters are the lingua franca of people who put paper in public places. Still, Owen pockets it like a man who collects bits of luck in case the day needs topping up. He walks home in the kind of rain that does not consider itself rain and he thinks about watches and paper and the cost of breath. He catches his reflection in a charity shop window next to a row of orphaned dinner suits, and he pauses because the man in the glass looks like someone who has found a new corner in his own room. It is not joy. It is not sadness. It is the soft thing that sits between when you let it.\n\nSunday brings football on the County Ground and language in the street that believes itself only audible to the weather, and it brings a message from Mr. Kettle that he has decided to write K with his left hand forever because it slows him down and perhaps that is good medicine. It brings also a photograph from Ken of a whiteboard with the word boundary written and then circled and then circled again, and Owen laughs out loud and scares a pigeon into a sincerity it did not intend. He texts Maeve to say the boys with clipboards have been sat on and she asks if the dent left by their sitting is permanent, and he says nothing is, and she says that doesn\u2019t make a case to my taste and then sends a picture of a pub roast with the caption officer down.\n\nOn Monday a call comes from Greenway Avenue, not from the house with the affronted chair but from next door where the lilac fleece lives. The woman in the fleece has a voice like a cardigan and she says there has been a man in the street with an argument and the argument was with either the world or a hedge, she could not tell which because both remained unresponsive. They go because arguments have a way of acquiring spectators and therefore plot, and find a man not young who is remonstrating with a bin as if it has betrayed his trust. He is wearing a tweed waistcoat that has seen rain and he smells like barley sugar and old tobacco and he is Kevin Kettle and he is, apparently, angry at the concept of waste collection schedules. He looks at Owen like a man who has been found mid-monologue and is mildly embarrassed. He says he has been experimenting with not swallowing all his feelings because Ken says you must sometimes give them little windows and he has decided to test the advice on a Thursday\u2019s bin because the bin cannot be hurt. He laughs and says that perhaps he will choose a tree next time because bins draw crowds and he is too old to be beheld.\n\nOwen stands with him and says he is proud of him for sparing the bin any more eloquence and Mr. Kettle says in a small voice that his hands shook on Friday and he does not know why and he would like to know why but not the sort of why that has a price tag. He says he has been alive a long time and does not want to reach the end and think that all his feelings were receipts he never read. Owen realizes, standing in that tidy street, that the watch has returned to its wrist, the peony has returned to a room as a thing and not a symbol, and the town is back to its fidgeting and its tiny tenderness and its always-almost disasters. He realizes also that the case is not closed because cases never are, they are only moved to a shelf where they can look at other cases and nod politely.\n\nHe goes back to the station and puts a note in the file that says the watch was found and the bruise remains undecided and the gutter men are being discouraged with legal paper and volume, and he writes a line to remind himself later that what mattered was not whether a peony is evidence but that it was a thing people held onto when the room was a bit too much. On his desk, the paper flower looks less ridiculous than it did and more like a standard he has chosen to carry. He writes a message to Katie to say that if she needs wire he knows a yard where the man selling it will pretend not to be generous and the boy measuring it will be learning the names of trees from the ends of splinters. She replies with a picture of a ribbon misbehaving on purpose and he feels the peculiar satisfaction of being included in someone else\u2019s inventory of small victories.\n\nSilas appears at four without fanfare because even he has days when he does not need an entrance, and he leans on the corner of the desk until Griggs gives him a look that would peel paint. He says the cousin-cousin with the van has been told to stop lending credibility to people with clipboards because credibility is the only currency he has left that isn\u2019t counterfeit. He says he has found something at the river, and he produces from his pocket an object wrapped in a piece of his own shirt because theatre might be silly and also why waste an opportunity. It is a watch strap, not a watch, the leather chewed by water into something that would consider being a fish. He says it was snagged on a hook near the low bridge and it could belong to anybody and he thought of Owen because he is merciless to himself and mercy for others is something he is trying under adult supervision.\n\nOwen takes the strap and he thinks of the park and Nigel and the way objects get lost in a town like this by moving not far and by people who know the wrongness of their own hands and want not to. He logs it and labels it and gives it a number that will not flinch and thanks Silas in a tone that is not a truce but is not not a truce. Silas smiles like an abandoned pier being flattered by the tide and says he will bring biscuit donations to Ken because Ken\u2019s biscuits are ambitious but not quite generous enough, and he leaves with that small satisfying spin that means he would like the last image of him to be of a man who can be claimed for goodness at least once a week.\n\nAt shift\u2019s end, Owen goes to the river and leans because leaning is a vice he can defend in court. The peony is at home and he misses it in the pocket of his coat like a talisman he keeps telling himself is just paper. He watches a swan do that thing swans do where they pretend to be ballet and actually they are knives with feathers, and he listens to the town clear its throat for evening. Somewhere, in a room with shut curtains, a woman is writing down the names of the people who came when she asked for help and the names of the people who came when she didn\u2019t, and she is deciding she prefers the second list. Somewhere, in the salvage yard, Aiden is learning to distinguish oak from ash by its weight as if the world were a person you could know by how they sit on your lap. Somewhere, in a back room that smells of tissue and tea, Katie is counting ribbon by hand and letting herself cheat on three because she is human and so are we.\n\nHe goes home and opens his window with the caution he has for objects that have decided to be in his care, and he sits at his table and makes a peony that is less showy than the first and more like something that would last in a room which has had to learn the trick of lasting. He thinks not in conclusions because they don\u2019t trust him, but in the good half-thoughts that later become a way of being. He thinks that sometimes a bruise is a comma and not a full stop. He thinks that sometimes a watch goes on a small tour of the town and returns in time for the sentence to make sense. He thinks that sometimes paper is a truth because it remembers the hands that made it, and he thinks that if he is going to continue to be the sort of man who knocks on doors and collects other people\u2019s nights in trays, then he had better also continue to be the sort of man who sits quietly and folds, and lets the room be a room and not a report. He thinks this and then lets the thought be boring on purpose, because boredom is rest dressed as something else, and he puts down the scissors and eats toast and answers Maeve\u2019s text with a photograph of the flower on the table and the words: chief superintendent of tissue reporting a small, unimportant success, over.Chapter Seven\n\nMarket day arrives with a fuss and then pretends it didn\u2019t make one. The tents go up along Fore Street like bright little arguments, the tarpaulins shivering at the idea of rain, the air already scented with onions learning to be burgers and coffee that has ambitions it may or may not fulfil. Owen stands by the station window with his coat half on and watches the traders lay out the objects that will, for a handful of hours, be the town\u2019s priorities. There is a stall of wools in improbable sherbets, another of tools that look like they were born to outlive men, and a table covered in old crockery that someone will call vintage because it is nicer to lie if the lie is pretty. He thinks that somewhere in this street there will be a watch that once belonged to someone else, and he tells his head that we are done with watches, we have done what we can for watches, and then his hands put themselves in his pockets because they do not trust him not to go looking anyway.\n\nMaeve arrives with a pastry she insists is medicinal and a face that is pretending to disapprove of weekends. She drops into the chair opposite with the neat collapse of a gymnast who only displays it when nobody is asking for it and pushes the pastry at him as if it has offended her. \u201cGriggs is vibrating,\u201d she says. \u201cTrading Standards want a hand with the door-to-door men, and he says words like joint operation as if he is asking us to marry a bureaucracy. Also, I promised my nephew I\u2019d get him a knock-off football shirt that will disintegrate the second it sees a washing machine, and I don\u2019t want to die in prison for complicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll make you go to court for wearing trainers,\u201d Owen says, taking a bite of the pastry and trying not to grimace at the sugar deciding to be his entire mouth. \u201cWhat\u2019s our pitch to the clipboard men.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, we too have clipboards,\u201d she says, and taps her temple with a pencil. \u201cWe\u2019re to be visible without frightening the elderly into not making tea. Smile, but only with the top half of your face, and try to look like a leaflet. And then,\u201d she adds, leaning in because if a thing is said leaning in it becomes something else, \u201cKatie\u2019s doing a stall outside Paper & Thread for the workshop\u2014Mother\u2019s Day prequel\u2014and I said we could hover. Community reassurance. Also, she said she\u2019s got new wire and I want to see what new wire looks like when you\u2019ve been burgled for old wire.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew wire looks like a promise,\u201d Owen says, and Maeve, who spots his soft sentences and saves them for blackmail, raises an eyebrow and lets it pass without harvesting. She has patience for the little enthusiasms he has chosen; she has a list of them in her head and she keeps it to herself like a child\u2019s pocket collection of good stones.\n\nGriggs does indeed vibrate. He does it by changing the colour of the word urgent in his voice and then pretending he didn\u2019t. He stands in the briefing room next to a blown-up photograph of a fluorescent jacket with no logo, and he points at it like a man introducing a relative he would rather not have to acknowledge. \u201cWe share this town with opportunists,\u201d he says, and at opportunists his lip does a small and involuntary curl as if he has bitten lemon. \u201cIf they knock and talk, you knock and talk louder. I don\u2019t want to read on Facebook that a man in a hat with a pen defeated the Queen of Taunton with chat. Trading Standards, TS to their mates, will say their bit about cold calling zones. We will not roll our eyes where they can see us. We will, as ever, be professional.\u201d\n\nThe map of the town on the wall is beginning to look to Owen like a board game invented by someone who was very fond of rules and rather less fond of fun. He traces, without moving, the route from the salvage yard to the Meeting House to Paper & Thread to Greenway Avenue and back to the station, and it draws an untidy heart he will not name. He and Maeve go out into the market and let the noise of buying things that may not be required do the blanket thing to the background anxieties of the week, and for a small set of minutes he lets himself be the kind of stranger who drinks a paper cup of coffee and nods at a dog carrier full of knitted hats. He sees Mr. Kettle long before Mr. Kettle sees him because Mr. Kettle is at a stall offering old postcards of seaside towns, and he is giving an impromptu lecture on the ethics of hand-tinting to a teenager who is politely pretending to be interested and who will later buy one to prove to himself he is kind.\n\nPaper & Thread has come out to meet the day. The sandwich board promises paper peonies with the encouragement of a midwife, and Katie has a table under a small tent the colour of childhood dresses. The tissue is stacked like a sweetshop and the wire is coiled into neat little crowns, and there are three finished blooms for show that look impossible enough to begin conversations. Katie is in a jumper that is the blue of tins on good shelves and her hair has formed a compromise with itself that manages to look intentional. She sees Owen and then registers the badge and smooths her face into the I-know-where-we-are smile that small business owners develop to survive both the public and officialdom, and then she remembers herself and does her other smile, which is a thing she gives her chosen people.\n\n\u201cYou look like PC Plod\u2019s handsome cousin,\u201d she says, lightly, and he blushes because he is not used to handsome being used anywhere near his vicinity unless it is in a joke about antique furniture. \u201cStaying?\u201d\n\n\u201cHovering,\u201d he says. \u201cOfficial hovering. Supportive presence slash threat to pickpockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can work with that,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll sell peonies and you sell the idea of moral improvement.\u201d\n\nMr. Kettle ambles over with the quickness of a man who has seen three diversions and chosen the fourth. He has a tweed waistcoat on because of course he does, and his beard is a tidy compromise with his age. He brings with him the smell of barley sugar out of habit, and he produces from his pocket without fanfare three wrapped sweets as if he is paying a toll. \u201cOfficer Tissue,\u201d he says to Owen with a tiny bow, and to Katie he offers his hands for ribbon duty like a man approaching Communion. \u201cI am to make something inadequate for a lady whose grandchildren have bought her an iPad,\u201d he says. \u201cI refuse to be bested by a rectangle. Give me wire, give me paper, give me a fight I can win.\u201d\n\nKen Wright appears in the way of a man who has the timings of other people\u2019s towns in his diary. He wears a jacket that has forgiven him for being Ken and a smile that is not the whole of his face, and he stands just outside the tent as if waiting to be asked for his opinion. He does his public-spirited thing where he buys a flower and then makes sure no one is watching when he produces a loyalty card for coffee, and for two minutes he is only a man making a morning look like a choice he has elected to make well. He tells Owen very quietly that he has given a talk to the WI about the dangers of believing men with laminated ID, and he says it with the tone of a man who expects a trophy and will happily accept a biscuit in its stead.\n\nThe butcher is where he always is at this time, arms folded, mouth set into a grin rueful enough to be used as seasoning. He calls across the road, \u201cSarge, are those real,\u201d and Owen shouts back without using a shout that, no, they are made of the tears of social workers, and Katie chokes on a laugh so sudden she turns it into a cough. There is weather in the air like a rumour, and the gulls are being articulate about a chip two streets away, and the town is busy making the argument for itself without needing anyone to moderate.\n\nThe first thing goes wrong and it does not look like a thing going wrong because it is polite. A woman whose bag has a strap like a belt and a face like someone who has been kind for a long time reaches for her purse to pay for a bloom and finds that the purse is behaving like magic. It is not there, and it is not anywhere, and the moment makes a very small silence around her, a circle of suddenly uncooperative air. She says, lightly, that she is an idiot and then more quietly that she had it at the cake stall and then she describes the purse to Owen as if it is an old friend who has run off with a stranger. He and Maeve do the little triangle dance of police in a crowd, the one that says we are here and not here, and they exchange a look that says we are back to theft when we wanted to be at craft.\n\nRo is along the edge of the stall with Min, his fingers investigating a length of wire as if it has a song. He is doing that pre-adolescent thing where his attention could feed a city and you can watch the moment when it narrows into sense. \u201cHat man,\u201d he says, not looking up, and points with his chin. \u201cSame as pawnshop? Beard like he\u2019s hiding a biscuit. Brown hat that doesn\u2019t like his head. He is practicing being not noticed.\u201d\n\nThe beard that called itself Dave and then Gary is browsing the mugs two stalls down, and browsing is too generous because his eyes do not rest anywhere long enough to describe having enjoyed resting. He has a brown felt hat that makes him look worse, which is an achievement, and his jacket is the colour of compromise. His hands are the wrong kind of careful. When his eyes pass over Owen you can see the instinct to be pleasant, to be charming, to be the sort of person men shake hands with in pubs, and you can see the calculation that says that this particular target has read that book and returns it with annotations.\n\nOwen doesn\u2019t give chase because there is nothing to chase yet and because he has learned the economies of movement available to him. He lets the crowd take him and he slides sideways into the wake of the man whose aliases have all begun to resemble each other. He hears behind him the smooth, unrelated conversations of a town on a Saturday morning\u2014someone wanting peas without the peas, someone else making hard weather of a simple technical matter\u2014and he lets the sound be there while his eyes do their job. The man with the hat does the thing where he looks in a shop window without seeing anything behind the glass and then makes a decision that looks like indecision. He turns toward the multi-storey like a man who has considered walking to the moon and settled for the level just below the roof of Sainsbury\u2019s.\n\nUp in the car park the air has a different temperature, a sort of concrete weariness, and the man\u2019s hat looks suddenly like theatre in a foyer where no one is yet seated. He slows, which is either fatigue or performance, and then he bends to tie an already tied shoe, which is the move thieves learned in the year nineteen whenever and have been loyal to ever since. Owen lets the distance be what it needs to be to make his voice arrive as if it has walked, and he says the man\u2019s name as if it is a shared secret from another time. \u201cGary,\u201d he says, and when the head comes up too quickly he says, \u201cOr was it Dave. It changes for me as well. Do we need to pick a new one for you in front of a desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cFound it,\u201d the man says, as if they have just discovered a spoon under a sofa cushion and the whole of a complicated social exchange can be reset to kindly domestic irritation. He puts a hand in his inside pocket and produces a purse with the casual guilt of a child who knows the adult already knows. It is the right purse, of course it is, the little silver clip like a smile, and he holds it out as if he is donating it to a raffle. \u201cI was going to hand it in,\u201d he says, and then laughs at himself because the lie arrives late and tired and makes no difference to what happens next.\n\nThey do the talk on the stairwell because it is private enough and public enough and because the whole point is to make the man understand he is being treated as a person even as he is being treated as a man who will be, in about eleven minutes, asked to sit somewhere he does not want to sit. Owen uses the tone he saves for people who are not strangers to the idea that they are better than their day and he asks the questions that are less about catching and more about making a map. The watch is not on him, which would have been too neat, but there are two wallets, both of which are returned to their owners within half an hour in an exchange that feels like putting back a word in the right sentence. There is also wire in the boot of his car, which is the wrong kind of wire because it is new and clean and bought with intent. He says he was going to mend a trellis; he says his girlfriend likes roses; he says he has more than one girlfriend and all of them like roses; and he stops talking when he hears the footstep of a man arriving with paperwork in his pocket.\n\n\u201cWho are you working for today,\u201d Owen asks, because men like this always are, and the answer comes with the rolled eyes of someone who thinks the hierarchy he belongs to is a joke even as it keeps him fed. \u201cBlake,\u201d he says, and then because he has had to tell the truth somewhere in a week for it to go down and this is his moment, \u201cTwo-Eights. He calls himself that. For the plate. For luck. He thinks the number eight is his mother. He thinks the council owes him a road.\u201d\n\nTwo-Eights is the man in the white van with more eights than a reasonable plate ought to, and the satisfaction is small and present because it says the town is not reinventing its wolves every morning; it is borrowing them from the last night and changing the hats. Owen waits for the trade to show in the man\u2019s face, the one that says what he will give and what he will keep, and he lets the arrest be untheatrical because dignity is both policy and, if he is honest, a superstition. In the market below, life continues to sell itself, which is the most reassuring and least comforting fact he knows.\n\nBy the time he brings the purse back to the woman at the stall it has become a story she will tell with gratitude and a quiet embarrassment, and she tries to give him a five-pound note for his trouble as if this is a fairy tale, and he says please don\u2019t because he has never known what to do with that kind of tender. Katie does the competent person\u2019s magic lady act where she makes the only right words available to a person whose day has wrong in it. She tells the woman she has lovely hands and puts the flower aside as if it has a name and she will not sell it to anyone else, and she tucks a tag into the ribbon and for a second the market becomes a place where people are supervised by a kind god.\n\nSomething goes wrong again, in a different key. One of the finished flowers on the table disappears and is back and disappears and is back and then is not back, and it is small but it hurts because things have been taken from this small room under a tent enough times, and Katie stands straighter because uprightness is resistance, and then it turns out to be a little girl with a fringe like a lawn and eyes that are prepared to cry, and she has been in possession of the peony for three minutes without understanding that possession can be complicated, and her father returns it with a clumsy speech about honesty, and Owen watches the exact moment when shame gets introduced into someone\u2019s house and decides to be a door that opens rather than a wall that instructs. He gives the little girl a scrap of tissue and shows her a fold you can teach a person in thirty seconds that gives them ownership of their hand, and she looks at the crumpled thing as if it has given her back something she did not know she needed.\n\nMidday is all edges. Trading Standards arrive in hi-vis that actually means something, and the clipboard men sidle off to be elsewhere, and Mr. Kettle completes the ribbon-pinning with the solemnity of a man performing dentistry on a doll. Ken does a round of handshakes as if he is running for a very small office and slips Owen a card that says boundary on it in his own careful handwriting, and then immediately asks if it was too much and if so he will withdraw the word. Maeve, who has a capacity for being useful while appearing to be entirely ornamental, does ten conversations at once, two of which are with dogs, and concludes that the town is in a mood to be told not to be careless without being told it is careless. The butcher sells a man sausages with the air of a priest distributing absolution, and a teenager practices a trick with a fidget spinner as if he intends to make it his trade.\n\nSilas passes by with his gravity set to charming and makes a point of not seeing Owen until he has already been seen, and then he does a little bow like a man who has rehearsed grace. He buys a flower and takes a long time doing it and longs to be taken for a man who knows what to do with paper in the presence of a woman who knows what to do with paper, and he compliments the wire in a way that can be taken three ways. He has a boy at his shoulder who is not Aiden because the world is more generous in its malice than to repeat itself, and he gives the boy money he calls lunch rather than wages, and the boy looks like someone who has been paid for the first time and suspects the note will evaporate if he unfolds it in the wrong shop.\n\nWhen the cake stall begins toothless gossip about the arrest up in the car park the air shifts in that way where the town remembers what it is supposed to do for itself. People are suddenly grateful for each other in principle, even if they are quite cross with each other in the detail, and somebody buys a bouquet they do not need and then remembers someone who might and takes it to them and by the end of the hour Katie\u2019s box is half empty in the way boxes are ideally empty. Owen lets himself be pleased that his presence is part of the right theatre and not the wrong one, and he lets himself think, for three seconds, that perhaps it is possible to have a job that takes and a hobby that gives and let both swim in the same sea without making a killing.\n\nOf course the day would not be the day without a small, good thing being spoiled. Halfway through a demonstration of the crease-friend trick something grabs the back of Owen\u2019s arm through his coat and when he turns it is not danger but an urgency that looks like danger to someone who has not had to practice the difference. Laura Vale stands there with a face that has either cried or is about to and she is holding the watch at an angle that suggests she is afraid of damaging the time. \u201cIt\u2019s not hers,\u201d she says, and the sentence is an admission ticket into another hour. \u201cThe engraving\u2014the date is right but the wear is wrong. I woke last night and I just knew. I took Mum\u2019s jewellery box out of the drawer and I looked at pictures and I knew. I\u2019m sorry. It is not hers.\u201d\n\nHe takes the watch because he has to and because he wants to save her hands from the job they have taken on, and he registers the small quake in her voice that comes when a person has to unravel a relief they have prematurely laid on themselves. It is not the first time something has come back wrong in the shape of right and it will not be the last, and it is not anyone\u2019s fault in particular and yet it will insist on making itself someone\u2019s for the purposes of the person who wants to sleep tonight. He tells her they will take it back without letting go of the fact that the last week needed this to be neat and it is not going to be, and she presses her lips together as if to stop the word at least coming out and then says it anyway and then asks how you return a thing to the wrong sort of belonging.\n\nAfternoon draws its own little borders. Trading Standards pack away their pop-up gravitas and leave leaflets about not letting men in no matter how persuasive their fluorescent vests, and the market gives up on itself in patches and then all at once as the stalls disassemble into the luckless shapes they are when not on duty. A child has lost a shoe and is laughing about it as if this is a win, and a man has bought a painting of a dog because the artist was disappointed in a way that required rescue, and a gull is making its case to be included in the general amnesty for nuisances. Katie counts the cash into the jar with the concentration of a person honouring the pact between honest work and honest reward, and between notes she checks her phone because a woman who runs a shop is in a permanent relationship with a device that lets the world tell her what it wants from her.\n\nThey take statements in the back room with the kettle doing its journey from hum to sing like a friend pretending a talent. The purse lady thanks them three times, each time for a different thing\u2014the manner, the speed, the absence of contempt\u2014and Owen files this away as if it will feed him when he has a day that does not. They give Gary/Dave to custody with the amicable sternness of teachers finally sending a boy to the head, and he goes with that mixture of relief and outrage that is the standard uniform of the temporarily caught. There will be a court and a story and there will be the attempt to make out of his day an aberration rather than a summary, and Owen will do his lines and not enjoy them and then he will go to the river and make himself into a person who can fold paper without the paper thinking he is occupying the room too loudly.\n\nIn the quiet after the quiet, between taking their coats off and deciding they have taken them off for the last time today, he and Maeve find themselves in the evidence store in front of a box that has not been kind enough to resolve into a utility. The door-to-door operation has a smell, and it is stress and cheap deodorant and sometimes private fear leaked into public space, and it clings. Maeve, who has a capacity for cruelty when it is kind, says, \u201cYou look like the market let you be a person,\u201d and he says, \u201cIt did,\u201d and then he adds, \u201cLaura\u2019s watch is not her watch,\u201d and they both stand in the do-not-touch of what that requires. \u201cWe will find out who Nigel\u2019s Nigel is,\u201d she says. \u201cWe will talk to Two-Eights again and I will count that as a weekend activity.\u201d She is writing a joke and a promise into the same sentence and the fact it works is the reason he will follow her into rooms until one of them forgets that you can come back out of them.\n\nKen\u2019s email lands with his set of polite bullet points and a photograph of the whiteboard with boundary written and then improved by someone at the meeting to include the word porous in small letters underneath, and Owen laughs because the word makes him think of bread. He writes back thank you in a tone that is careful not to be either snide or wooed, and he closes his eyes in his chair for the kind of rest that could be legitimately described as blinking. When he opens them again there is a strip of late light on the floor in front of his boots like tape for an actor, and the station is full of the sounds of people convincing themselves they are nearing the end of something.\n\nHe goes to Paper & Thread because the day will sulk if he doesn\u2019t. The shop has taken back its afternoon and looks as if it has inhaled, and Katie is elbow-deep in ribbon and triumph and minor grief and she has that look of someone who has been good all day and will now, if permitted, be silly. They stand on the floor among the shelves and talk about wire as if it is a moral choice and he holds the wrong watch in his palm and says too much and she edits it into the amount she can bear to own. She tells him she will teach him to do a centre that won\u2019t sulk and he realises he has been waiting his whole week to be told to do something in that exact tone. She gives him three sheets of tissue in a colour that does not exist on glorified screens and a piece of ribbon that will not behave, and she says, \u201cTake this home and make it misbehave correctly,\u201d and he finds himself wanting to pass that instruction on to his job.\n\nThe text from Aiden arrives at the bus stop, a message that is both proud and tentative because boys are trained to be cautious with proud. Got paid, it says, and a picture of a fiver with a thumb in it, and then, as if covering his own joy with a blanket, still got to tell my mum I didn\u2019t spend it. Owen writes back good boys tell their mums and brave boys do it badly and still do it, and Aiden replies with an emoji that he will later disavow because softness is a liability and a superpower and he is not yet able to hold those two facts in the same pocket.\n\nThat night, because not sleeping is a skill he has and he refuses to treat it as one, he puts the wrong watch on the table next to the flowers and he watches the hands agree to disagree with the hour. He takes the tissue and he makes a centre that does not sulk, not all at once and not beautifully, but he makes it, and he sits in the small room that making opens up and he stays there the length of a song he does not like, and then a silence he does. He thinks of Silas pretending not to improve, of Ken pretending to be a man you cannot dislike, of Mr. Kettle actually being one, of Laura refusing the easy comfort to make room for the truth, of Maeve putting crisps on his desk like a sacrament, of Katie making the town friendlier than it would have been without her, and he thinks that if you collect enough small domestic braveries they make a defence you can stand behind without having to memorise a speech.\n\nIn the morning the inevitable happens, not dramatically, not with sirens, but with an email and a sigh and then a phone call because everything has to have three forms now. The rugby club reports a loss of wire delivered to a back door that had been asking the universe to prove itself unkind, and the loss is discovered because a man who does balloons has a conscience about tickets. The shoe prints match the brand that smells like lunchtime fights and birthday money, and there is a picture from a cheerful yellow camera mounted above a back lane that shows a hood that reveals nothing and a gait that reveals a little too much. Owen puts it with the rest and resists the urge to draw a cartoon wolf on the map with a speech bubble saying \u201cI did not bring a logo,\u201d and instead he writes up the thing the way it wants to be written.\n\nThey go to see Two-Eights because this is the game and because there is a pleasure to be had in a conversation you know you will win by not needing anything immediate from it. He has a van that has undergone three different eras of care and none recently, and he has a face that looks as if he would practise being honest if there was an app. He denies everything and graciously allows that some things might have happened adjacent to him without his knowledge, and he says that wire is wire and a boy is a boy and who can be expected to understand the tides of either. Maeve does that thing she does where she speaks as if she has just woken from a restorative nap and tells him that the town has decided to learn his number, and he smiles the non-smile of a man who thinks the town can be made amnesiac on demand and will enjoy being wrong.\n\nOn his way back, Owen crosses the bridge and looks down at the river in its usual state of mind. A man is throwing a stick for a dog that is not named Nigel and the stick is not in competition with the river for the dog\u2019s attention because the river is winning the game the dog is not playing, and the man laughs like a person who needed to hear his own noise. The town is already one foot into Monday, regulations and injustices and washing machines arguing back, and he lets the crowd fold him without thinking better of it. He has a centre that does not sulk in his pocket and it is ridiculous and helpful and he decides to be both about it. He thinks about stopping by the Quaker Meeting House to read the board that says there is something of God in everyone without wanting to fight the sentence, and then he thinks he will not, he will go to the shop that sells brass screws and ask unnecessary questions about countersinking because talking in that shop is a form of meditation for older men and he is trying on the idea.\n\nBy the time he reaches the station he has the shape of a small plan for his hands for tonight and the shape of a much less satisfying plan for his day, and he is greeted by the whiteboard which now features, under the green heading DOOR MEN, a new line in someone else\u2019s hand that says FLOWERS?, which is both a joke and a decision waiting to be made. Griggs passes and reads it and pretends he doesn\u2019t understand what the question is because if he acknowledges that nice things can be involved in ugly work he will have to stop storing his shirts in the freezer. \u201cYardley,\u201d he says, \u201cif you bring me good news I will pretend I deserve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have news,\u201d Owen says, and he holds out a watch that isn\u2019t, and he holds back a centre that is, and he watches his boss be a man who requires a format. The day exists and he will go through it and he will find, later, that the part of it that stays is a ribbon he made behave, and he will be both annoyed and grateful, and he will tell no one and tell everyone by becoming someone\u2019s quiet, manageable friend. He will text Maeve a photograph of a bowl of apples and ask if she wants to be sad about something on purpose, and she will answer with an emoji of a bin, and he will know that they are, despite the universe being what it is, going to make it to unimportant successes at least twice before Friday.Chapter Nine\n\nBy Tuesday the rain had decided it would be the sort that apologised while continuing, the sky writing sorry in a script you had to squint at to see. The station had the particular Tuesday smell of wet coats resigning themselves to radiators, and the whiteboard, which had acquired a life that occasionally bit, now featured FLOWERS? written in a more hopeful green than the person who wrote it would admit to owning. Griggs stood beneath the question like a man at a museum confronted by an installation he suspects is insulting him. He did a small sigh that could have been wind or could have been a comment on human nature and said, \u201cIf flower deliveries are now reconnaissance, I will require this town to find a new hobby.\u201d\n\nThey were supposed to be writing the boring bits\u2014doorstep warnings turned into numbers for the Home Office to argue over\u2014but Marion Vale\u2019s name was still sitting in the long corridor between case and file, and it made Owen\u2019s pen drag when he wrote it. Laura had called early to say the funeral director had dates, as if dates were logical in an illogical week, and he had done the thing he does where he is helpful without committing his insides to the conversation. He had almost said, when she said they were thinking of flowers, that paper was an option. He had almost told her about a room above a shop where you could sit and make something that admitted it wasn\u2019t going to last and decided to be beautiful anyway. He had not said it, because there are times when mixing your rooms is a species of theft.\n\nMr. Kettle solved the morning\u2019s purpose by phoning to say Elsie\u2019s door had been flirted with. His description: two men, both with the posture of men who have practised looking taller, one with new trainers that squeaked their own guilt, the other with a confidence that had to have been imported. They had leaflets that claimed the authority of lamination and a forged sense of neatness, and when he\u2019d told them he would be calling their office to check, both had the flinch of men who do not enjoy being called offices. \u201cAnd then,\u201d he said, with the pleased dignity of a man who has crafted his own anecdote, \u201cthey posted a note through Elsie\u2019s letterbox to say sorry they\u2019d missed her and signed it, Love K. I have never been so furious at a letter of the alphabet.\u201d\n\nOwen held the note in a plastic sleeve twenty minutes later and tried not to recognise the shape of a joke he hated. The paper was cheap, the kind that thinks it is already a memory, the K done with a hand trying for friendliness and landing in sales. There was a tiny smear where the pen had been lifted too slow. It was not Katie\u2019s left-handed wonk; it was someone who had watched kindness and attempted an impression. The ribbon that had been attached with a bit of tape had a very particular rib, and he saw Katie\u2019s shelves as if they were a field map\u2014the cheap satin, the expensive silk, the middle child she bought because people like options. This ribbon was the middle child, cream with a faint wire edge. The men had the sense to buy good material in small parcels. It made his throat feel thick with something he did not, strictly, have words for in this capacity. You cannot call ribbon evidence with the same face you use for blood.\n\nElsie, perched in her dressing gown like a small queen who had accidentally invited the village into her chamber, told the story of the knock as if it had been both a fright and a fable in the same minute. Her front room smelled of last night\u2019s toast and old lavender. She showed them how Mr. Kettle had stood, exactly there, angled so he could see both men and still block them with a politeness they could not argue with without becoming too obvious. \u201cThey said the word vulnerable twice in the first minute,\u201d she said, affronted. \u201cPeople who use the word vulnerable at my gate often require me to teach them the meaning of the word no.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re collecting the rubbish they post,\u201d Maeve said, with the smile she uses for women who have decided their house is sovereign territory. \u201cIs the ribbon familiar?\u201d\n\nElsie peered and sniffed it, because some women consider their noses to be an instrument of authority. \u201cThat is from the nice girl\u2019s shop,\u201d she said, as if identifying a cousin in a line-up. \u201cThe paper flowers. I bought one and it lasted five books. It did not make me think about watering. It made me think about being alive.\u201d Then, because she had to reclaim some power from the morning, she added, \u201cAnd I am not very cross. I am a bit cross. I am mostly tired of men with vans.\u201d\n\nOn the way back, the rain remembered it had other towns and took itself off to annoy someone else. The air felt emptied out and newly available. They cut by the Meeting House because Ken had arranged himself into their week and because his flyers were suddenly part of the way certain men learned certain corners of the town. He was in the foyer with a woman who had the edges of grief pressed in so far it looked like neatness. He saw them and held up a finger in apology, then finished whatever word he was giving her\u2014the kind of advice that can be moved from person to person without losing too much heat. When the woman had gone, he accepted the plastic sleeve like a man accepting a test. He looked at Love K and his mouth did the precise thing between insult and understanding.\n\n\u201cThese bastards,\u201d he said, very softly, in the way of a man who has once in his life deliberately chosen a swear word and is now very good at it. \u201cThey did this two years ago with my old logo. I wrote the words Talk to someone who cares on a leaflet and they stole the words and the font and used them to sell double glazing to widows. I changed everything. I got a lawyer who is six foot four in case that helps, and it didn\u2019t.\u201d He put the sleeve down with care, as if it might bruise. \u201cYou know this already, but I\u2019ll say it anyway. Kindness is a currency and currencies get counterfeited. Take the ribbons, take the phrases, the colours, the bit of your day that assumes something soft is safe. They use the tone as a crowbar. It is why I do the rules now, even though they make me feel like a headmaster: trust your doubt, don\u2019t make decisions at the door, ring a number you already know.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they come to your sessions,\u201d Maeve asked. \u201cThe men who counterfeit kindness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey come once,\u201d Ken said, and smiled a little with his mouth and not his eyes. \u201cThey come to see whether the room can be turned into a shop. They don\u2019t come back because the tea is free.\u201d\n\nThey found themselves at Paper & Thread without saying they would go there, which was becoming a habit and therefore a risk. The bell did its small, self-conscious bird and Katie looked up with a what-now expression that softened when she saw it was them. She listened to the description of the note with her hands in ribbon, the way people stand better when holding something. She didn\u2019t swear because she saved her swearing for glue and injustice, but her eyebrows did a curse. She fetched the middle-child ribbon and measured the rib between finger and thumb as if verifying a rumour. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey bought four little rolls on Saturday\u2014the day of the market. A man in a hat that had an argument with his head and a boy who took off and put back on his hood four times because he was rehearsing. They were charmers in the way that is born of a mother who is tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cHat,\u201d Owen said. \u201cBrown, felt. Beard like he\u2019s keeping a snack safe under it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one,\u201d she said. \u201cHe bought and did not flirt, which should be a relief and made me angrier.\u201d She reached under the counter and did a magician\u2019s flourish with the cheerful yellow camera. \u201cI listened to you and bought this. It likes to tell me it is uploading to a cloud, which sounds like a death. Do you want to look at my clouds.\u201d\n\nThe pictures gave them the hat in a cloudy margin and the shape of a boy who could be six boys and the currency of cash. They had a time: eleven-forty-one. On the back of the receipt book Katie had written in pencil, because she writes her day down in little ways, ribbon x 4, wire medium x 2, cash, hat. She had also drawn a rectangle and shaded it because sometimes hands need a shape to sit in after they have dealt with a man who believed his politeness protected him.\n\nBack at the station, the ribbon sat on the table like a polite animal that might bite. Griggs did his brief hover\u2014he has at least three\u2014and looked at the sleeve long enough to convey his displeasure at the universe\u2019s insistence on being ironic. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, which meant be careful. \u201cIf I see Love G anywhere in this town I will retire. I will fold.\u201d He left, carrying his weather with him. Maeve took her neat pen and added to the whiteboard under FLOWERS?: door decoy, ribbon from P&T, hat + hood, eleven forty-one, and then, because she can never resist making lists into something you can breathe inside, she wrote KINDNESS COUNTERFEIT in small letters above and then drew a line through it, not to cross it out but to hang things from it. Owen loved her for and despite that. He took a photograph of the board for his pocket and told himself he would delete it later because it looked like a poem and he didn\u2019t trust poems in his phone.\n\nAt lunch he and Maeve were assigned to support Trading Standards on a street in Galmington that had decided to be watchful. TS were out in their tidy vests that meant something, talking about cold-calling zones like people introducing a diet to a room of pastries. Owen had refined his walk for these things: neither prowling nor strolling, an official amble. Two-Eights\u2019 van was nowhere near because he was not stupid, but a cousin-cousin white transit with a winking indicator did a slow sweep and then kept on, which was as good as a wave. They spoke to three people on doorsteps who had had a knock and one who had had to close the door on an entire conversation he would once have felt obliged to finish. They met a woman who held her phone as if it were a weapon and took photographs of high-vis men without their permission \u201cfor the neighbourhood group,\u201d which is a way of saying for her heart. A man in a fleece asked what the point of a no-cold-calling zone was when the cold was everywhere, and Owen, who is paid to answer those, said sometimes signs are like saints, sufficient to make a certain type of person rethink sin. The man in the fleece bought that and put it in his pocket for later.\n\nThe salvage yard presented itself to the afternoon like a thought you\u2019d been trying to hold down. Owen went because either you go to the thing you are thinking about or it grows teeth while you attend to paperwork. Silas was in the back doing a practical man\u2019s ballet with a length of copper that wanted to be unmanageable. Aiden was sweeping with a focus that suggested sweeping was either a meditation or a penance, and given his age perhaps both. When he saw Owen he straightened in the way boys straighten for approval even when they have decided they will not need it this week. Silas did not look up immediately, which meant he was practicing not giving Owen his entrance.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making your place very dishonest-looking,\u201d Owen said, because the best way to turn a weather into a conversation is to punch it lightly in the arm. \u201cDid your life coach tell you to rearrange the sign that says \u2018we are legitimate\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told Ken I collect rude sentences for my private entertainment,\u201d Rook said, finally taking a hand off the copper. \u201cHe said I might consider whether the entertainment was a symptom of loneliness. I told him to invoice my loneliness and we would see if it pays. He wrote it on his board, which made the loneliness feel seen and therefore smug.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got men using paper flowers to test houses,\u201d Owen said. \u201cLeaving notes that say Love K as if they have our sense of humour. They bought ribbon from Katie. Tell your boys if anyone uses the word Love in a font at a door I will personally teach them that affection can include court.\u201d\n\nSilas\u2019s face did a flicker of something that had to work to get through. \u201cI\u2019ve seen one of those notes,\u201d he said, as if confessing to finding poetry in a skip. \u201cLeft under a mat up by the old people\u2019s bungalows. The boys you\u2019re describing are hungry, and not for poetry. I told Two-Eights if I see his men pretending to be post, I will feed his van to a magnet. He laughed and sent me a message of a magnet with a sad face. It\u2019s exhausting being charming when charm has gone out of fashion.\u201d He thought for a beat, eyes going to the place in the yard where decades of municipal railings whispered to each other. \u201cAlso, for what it\u2019s worth, one of that lot commissioned a frame,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not build it. I declined because the breath on the words smelled wrong. Asked about a trellis large enough to carry three men behind it. Asked about wheels he could bolt on and off. He thought he was being clever by not saying why. I thought I would consider breathing instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrame,\u201d Owen said. \u201cFor what.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor parties, he said,\u201d Silas replied, and the word parties came from his mouth like a joke that had not learned its own punchline. \u201cFor wedding backdrops. For the bit where the bride can pretend to be a vine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWire from Paper & Thread went missing the same hour,\u201d Owen said. \u201cRugby club ordered the week before. We have a hood in a cheerful yellow camera\u2019s idea of a lane. If you see a rolling wall of flowers and men behind it, perhaps throw a chair through it.\u201d\n\nRook hitched a shoulder. \u201cWe live in a town that can be talked into thinking it is smaller than it is,\u201d he said. \u201cA wall that rolls is a piece of theatre. Street theatre is a way to be a thief with applause. Tell your TS people to watch the back doors when the pretty thing goes by. And tell Ken that if he writes boundary again I will tattoo it on my forehead so he has to find a new word.\u201d\n\nHe walked away before Owen could decide whether to forgive him for being useful. Aiden followed, then hesitated and came back with the awkward bravery of boys who have decided to do a kindness and wish the world would not make a fuss. He held out a bag from Paper & Thread. Inside was wire, medium, two. He said, \u201cHe sent me to pay Katie back,\u201d and looked defiant and then immediately embarrassed that he had used the wrong face. \u201cNot for the bad men. For something else he didn\u2019t do. For buying time he didn\u2019t spend. I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s rubbish at explanations.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d Owen said. \u201cHe is recently rehearsing not being rubbish. It is very tiring to watch.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon had the left-behind feeling the town sometimes gets when the children are at school and the day is clearing its throat for later. The rugby club sent over CCTV that did, beyond reasonable doubt, show a piece of moving scenery being wheeled past their back door\u2014a trellis, improvised from builders\u2019 mesh and the sort of pipe you buy when you are too nostalgic to commit to scaffolding. The flowers on it weren\u2019t real but they weren\u2019t embarrassing. Owen thought of the word glamour\u2014glamour as a spell that changes the way a thing looks, glamour as the magic that makes you look and not see\u2014and he said it out loud and Maeve nodded because she had been looking for that word all week. They watched the hood and the hat and a third man whose job seemed to be to frown in front of the wheels and make passersby feel impolite for interrupting a performance. Nobody could be expected to call the police on a backdrop.\n\n\u201cHow did we arrive at villains with props,\u201d Griggs said when shown, like a man confronted by an avant-garde production of a play he once liked in a village hall. \u201cI am not funded for props.\u201d Then, because even he can enjoy competence when it is happening in front of him, he put a finger on the hat in the printout and said, \u201cGet him. If you can, get the grillman too.\u201d\n\nThey did not get him that day because life is not a montage and because rolling walls are moves you make twice at most. They instead did the long small work\u2014calls to clubs and halls and function rooms, to anyone who rented tables and joy by the hour, to ask if a frame had been ordered and if it had arrived with men who could charm a room into looking the other way. Trading Standards, cheeks flushed because being useful flips the blood to a new setting, began talking to neighbourhood groups about hospitality as tactic. Maeve did a radio spot, her voice trying not to sound like a school assembly, and told the town that love notes do not come through doors at tea time.\n\nIn the middle of that civics, a text arrived from Katie that said: a man is here buying ten peonies all in cream, says he can\u2019t write with his hand because he broke it, could I tag each one Love K for him please, and I said no and he said I was unhelpful and I smiled like a saint. Also, he smells of a new van and old trouble.\n\nOwen and Maeve did not run\u2014there are times when you do not run to a shop because you do not want to bring your job\u2019s heartbeat to a room where glue should be the loudest thing. They arrived briskly enough for the bell to do a flustered version of itself. Hat man was at the counter, hand in a sling that had not been tied by anyone trained in tying, speaking in a tone that had misused charm so long it had become sarcasm. He turned and saw their coats, and he did the brief, ridiculous calculation of whether he could hide ten cream peonies about his person, and then he did a smile that said he had decided to pretend he enjoyed being arrested.\n\n\u201cGary,\u201d Owen said, and that time the name landed like a stone. He took in the sling with the glance of a man counting exits and did not buy it, because the sling sat too high and had the wrong kind of knot, and because men like this rarely changed sides mid-week and broke themselves honestly. The shop\u2019s ceiling seemed to lower itself as if to listen. He told hat man that he was wanted for a conversation because of a purse, because of a watch-shaped argument, because of a van and its numbers, because of a rolling trellis with a dishonest sense of theatre. The man tried to produce indignation like a trick and dropped it. Katie watched over the counter with the kind of attention that could flay or bless and decided on the second.\n\nOn the way out, before the door bell could perform, Ro and Min came in with the wind, Ro holding a bundle of wire like a champion holds a bouquet. He stopped dead at the sight of the sling and the hat and the constellations of adult faces that still hadn\u2019t unclenched. He said, too loud, because children in rooms with cowboys either whisper or shout, \u201cIs this the man who steals watches,\u201d and the man said \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d and in that don't everything he did rearranged itself into the very shape of a yes.\n\nCustody smelled like it always does, a mix of long day and recent mop. The paperwork was speeded by the fact that the hat man\u2019s name had been collected three ways and would satisfy a judge. There was a moment, there is always a moment, when you see the thing inside the person you were concentrating on catching. He cradled his fake sling arm with a real tenderness that had not yet been used up by the morning, and he asked if he could keep the ribbon, and Owen, puzzled and irritated and human, put the small coil back into his pocket, because even men who counterfeit kindness sometimes need a bit of white silk to worry between their fingers while the afternoon tells them about themselves.\n\nThat evening the town allowed itself a little sunshine like a treat it had been promised on condition of good behaviour. Owen stood with his coat unbuttoned on the pavement outside Paper & Thread while Katie locked up, the key juddering because the world had taught it to fear being necessary. The butcher across the road was chalking prices and pretending to hate it. Ken passed and did his two-finger salute like a man in a film who had joined the army very late. Mr. Kettle emerged from a side street with two jonquils in a jar as if he had conjured them, and complimented the lock for surviving, and told Owen that Elsie had decided to write a fierce letter to the council and he had supplied adjectives by the bucket. They spoke, for three minutes, about nothing and everything, which is the only way to get through a Wednesday if you enforce laws in a town you also insist on liking.\n\nInside, the shop smelled like paper had decided to be a plant. Katie put the open till tray on the counter and counted with the seriousness of a person weighing something that wasn\u2019t money. \u201cThey will be cross that you got hat man in my shop,\u201d she said, and he braced for anger that did not come. \u201cI am cross that they have learned the shape of a love note. I am cross that they are using my ribbon to teach fear to women who will die one day and do not need any more practice. I am possibly also cross that you made me like you and then brought your job into my room. It will pass. It has to.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and did not say the careful thing he had prepared. He said instead, because his head had turned words over all afternoon until one unaddled itself, \u201cI keep thinking about counterfeit. It would hurt less if it didn\u2019t look so much like the thing. Real kindness leaves fingerprints that don\u2019t show until later. Counterfeit kindness leaves a residue that is sticky on day one. We should teach that. That\u2019s not very police.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can do both,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can teach law. I can teach ribbons. Ken can teach breathing and then I\u2019ll bully him in the doorway about it. Mr. Kettle can give old ladies barley sugar and make them tell him their adult children aren\u2019t telephoning enough. Rook can be wrong in public and right once a week for fun. You can catch the hat. I\u2019ll sell cream. We\u2019ll manage a town.\u201d\n\nThey stood there, the two of them, in a small shop that sometimes performed theatre and sometimes saved the day\u2019s balance with glue, and they agreed, without saying it, that the world would not be better if only it admitted the shape of criminal minds. It might be better if paper was allowed to be paper and hands were allowed to be hands.\n\nHe went home by the river because it would have been rude not to. The light had entered that late stage where it apologised to windows privately and made bridges into ideas. He made the centre that did not sulk because he had promised himself he would, and this one did not sulk in a way that felt like a tiny negotiated peace. He made a leaf that did not want to be in the same family as the other two and decided that sometimes families function regardless. He wrote down in his book not the arrests and the times and the names, though those went somewhere too, but a sentence he would not have owned last year: do not let the counterfeit teach you to distrust the real. He thought it might be a thing he could live in for a week.\n\nJust before sleep could trick him, his phone made the noise that meant someone who wasn\u2019t quite allowed was asking to be allowed anyway. It was Laura. She had been through her mother\u2019s drawers again, she said. She had found an old jeweller\u2019s box with the impression of a watch long gone on velvet. Beneath the velvet, in the space where a spare link had once lived, there was a scrap of paper folded so small it had thought it was dust. On it, in a script that had remembered how to be young, was written K\u2014Pls fetch hedgehog from Wendy\u2019s, x. It was nothing, she said, and also faced the right way. Owen, who had spent a day watching notes make rooms bigger and smaller, said, \u201cKeep it,\u201d and then added, because it was the thing he had, \u201cand bring it to the funeral so we can put it in the bowl with the apples.\u201d She did not ask him why apples, and he did not tell her about October, and the language they didn\u2019t have found them a room and let them sit down.",

                              "content": "By dawn the town is a map of damp streets and sleep-warmed windows, an uncertain sketch washed with grey. The tower of St Mary Magdalene leans into the light as if bending to listen to the traffic. The early bus coughs along East Street, the river makes a noise like a held breath. In the police station, they keep the night in a tray and pour it out only when they absolutely must.\n\nHe stands at the window above the car park and watches condensation bloom on the windscreen of an unmarked Vauxhall. The glass fogs over as though the car might be shy. Detective Sergeant Owen Yardley presses a knuckle into his right eye and makes a little firework of colour on his eyelid. Behind him, fluorescent lights hum their cheap unending sermon.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d Maeve Kerslake asks, appearing with two mugs. She sets one down, tea pale as weak sunlight. The corner of her mouth has a habitual smudge of sarcasm, as if life keeps touching her there.\n\n\u201cMore or less,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Vauxhall is definitely here. It\u2019s trying to grow moss.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake the new Mondeo,\u201d she says. \u201cPretend you\u2019re important.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not important,\u201d he says, and takes the tea.\n\n\u201cYou did a twelve to twelve. You\u2019re permitted to talk about yourself like someone people should listen to.\u201d Her hair is in a plait that has escaped several times and been wrangled back with office supplies. A paperclip shows in the twist.\n\nHe nods at the whiteboard. A dead man from Halcon estate with a bruise like a moon under his eye. A burglary that turned into something else mid-sentence, as some sentences do when you say them out loud.\n\n\u201cCredit cards didn\u2019t go,\u201d Owen says. \u201cJust the tin with coins for the meter.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they needed change. Everyone always needs change in this town.\u201d Maeve sips. \u201cDo you dream of crime when you do these shifts?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dream of the vending machine turning against me. The flap refuses to open. I can see the crisps, but they\u2019re for other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. Last week it only took ten pences. I thought I\u2019d entered a 1986 wormhole.\u201d\n\nThey stand a while, each doing the separate work of not thinking about what happens next; the paperwork, the callouts, the small acts of tidiness that might avert a catastrophe or might just be tidy for the sake of it. On the sill there are three dead flies and someone\u2019s spare ID lanyard coiled like a sea snake.\n\nAt nine, they go to High Street where a man in a gilet has been standing very still for long enough to make everyone nervous. He is staring at the window of a craft shop called Paper & Thread. The display is a riot of lime and violet and coral flowers, so thin the light can pass through them and still be colourful. Petals like moth wings, like pastry. A butcher from across the way has come out to smoke and sneer.\n\n\u201cGo on then,\u201d the butcher says to the gilet man, \u201cyou gonna propose to the window?\u201d\n\nThe man doesn\u2019t answer. He has stopped crying. He looks like someone who has just agreed with himself not to do something. Owen speaks to him softly and asks him his name and whether anything is going on that would be made better by a walk to Vivary Park and a talk on a damp bench. The man nods and nods again and they do that.\n\nWhile Maeve handles the butcher\u2019s need to be entertained and the shopkeeper\u2019s very genuine fright at having a crying man press his forehead to her tulips and roses (paper roses, not roses roses, obviously), Owen is left for twenty seconds in front of the glass. The flowers are fastened to a trellis of painted twigs, spirals of green tissue suggesting vines. Somebody has taken time. Somebody\u2019s hand was here, then there, then pinched a fold and breathed out and glued and placed. A little card announces a Saturday workshop. Paper peonies for Mother\u2019s Day, it says. No experience necessary. Tea and biscuits provided. Katie. The script is looped and soft.\n\nHis mother used to roll pastry like a prayer she once knew by heart and could remember with her hands if not her mouth. When she died it was October and his sister put a bowl of apples on the table and nobody touched them. After the funeral, the house smelled like rain in coats. They were not the kind of family that kept flowers.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Maeve asks from behind him, after the man in the gilet has walked away with the leaf-shadow of a decision on his face.\n\n\u201cLooking,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAt the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thinking of moonlighting? Sergeant Owen Yardley, florist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d be paper,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThose are paper?\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like it.\u201d\n\nShe laughs. \u201cIt looks like my nan\u2019s sitting room threw up.\u201d\n\nOn the way back to the station, the Mondeo makes a little rattle like a cough pretending it\u2019s not a cough. Owen drives deliberately, as if the white lines are made of china. He has always done things with his hands that way. When he writes he presses hard and nearly breaks the pen. When he touches a shoulder he does it as if the person might bruise. His hands do not always believe that they belong to him.\n\nThey stop at the crossing by the County Ground. Rain is trying and then not trying, the way it does in Somerset, like someone learning to juggle. Above the stand, gulls shout their thoughts on eternity. The light goes green. Maeve says something that makes him want to be somewhere else for a moment.\n\n\u201cSilas Rook was in the paper,\u201d she says. \u201cYou see?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, but the shape of the name finds all the little grooves in his mind that it has worn over the years. Silas Rook, the town\u2019s cleverest ghost. Owner of a salvage yard called Rook & Rooke, a shop for broken brass and pitted iron and chairs missing crucial legs, a dealer in secondhand glories. Also, historically, well-connected to people who take what isn't theirs and sell it to people who pretend they didn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cPhoto from some charity bash,\u201d Maeve says. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a tie as if he understands a tie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat charity?\u201d\n\n\u201cDogs with insomnia.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cSomething with Labrador in the name. His date has hair like she\u2019s been electrocuted pleasantly.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t say anything. It scratches at him, Silas Rook in print. As if Rook is a real man. Tall with a shaved head, a scar through the eyebrow like someone drew a line to make sure he could be recognized at a distance. A voice that distracts you from the words it is saying. The first time Owen arrested him they were both younger and Rook smiled in the back of the police van as if he were the one driving.\n\nAt the station door, DCI Griggs is hovering like a cloud that is about to be weather. He is the kind of man who looks like he keeps his shirts in the freezer. \u201cYardley,\u201d he says. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve met an idea and you\u2019re not sure if you like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met a window,\u201d Owen says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the time for windows,\u201d Griggs says, not smiling. He never smiles. If he does it will be by accident and in private. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a meet at ten. Bring legible notes from Halcon. If you can do legible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do legible.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Kerslake, I need you in court with me after. The Blagdon appeal. Wear something that suggests you don\u2019t own a dog.\u201d\n\nIn the briefing room someone has left a magazine open on the table with an article titled The Gentle Power of Craft. There are photos of small birds made of felt, buttons with faces, a woman cupping a teacup as if it is a planet she is responsible for. He almost puts the magazine in the bin. He doesn\u2019t. He slides it under the chair just as if the room might be offended.\n\nWhile Griggs reads out things the room already knows and adds the small changes that transform knowing into chastened understanding, Owen finds a piece of torn paper in his pocket with the words Paper peonies for Mother\u2019s Day and a phone number in looped handwriting. He cannot remember putting it there. He must have. Or the window put it there.\n\n\u201cYardley,\u201d Griggs says, \u201care we with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Owen says automatically, catching up with the way sentences are being assembled around him. Responsibilities. Other people\u2019s days. It all fits like furniture when you get it right, and bruises your shin when you don\u2019t.\n\nHe phones the number on his lunch hour, because there is a stupid little buzz in the back of his skull that won\u2019t stop. The phone rings three times and then a voice says, \u201cHello, you\u2019ve reached Katie, I might be covered in glue. Leave a message and I\u2019ll ring you back if my hands aren\u2019t stuck together.\u201d\n\nHe hangs up. Then feels ridiculous and phones again, and this time the voice is real-time. \u201cHello?\u201d Katie says. \u201cIs this glue? Who is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI found your number,\u201d he says, and hears how that sounds. \u201cIn the window. Not the number, the card. I\u2019m not, that sounds like I\u2019m a weirdo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeirdos welcome,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday three till five. You bring your hands and I bring the tissue paper and nobody dies.\u201d\n\nHe almost says we can\u2019t guarantee that. He says \u201cThanks\u201d instead and writes down the address. It\u2019s the back room above Paper & Thread. A narrow stair that will smell of cotton and dust.\n\nWhen he doesn\u2019t show in the break room after lunch Maeve wanders down the corridor to find him and he is in the evidence store looking at a plastic bag with a small ragged thing inside. It is the left-over of a party hat, the crown part, crushed. It smells faintly of hair spray. He is looking at it the way you might look at a creature that doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re watching, as if it could spook and run.\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Maeve says.\n\n\u201cThought it was something else,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing. Leave it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you think it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cA flower.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat looks like something you find under a table when everyone\u2019s gone home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\nShe loves him. Maeve loves him like a sibling you didn\u2019t choose but are relieved to find you like. She loves him enough to say, \u201cCome to the pub tonight and let someone else pick the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might have somewhere to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh really. Hot date with a photocopier.\u201d\n\n\u201cA class,\u201d he says, and then he is annoyed because he didn\u2019t mean to say it like that, like a secret. He looks at the bag again, the crushed fake crown. He doesn\u2019t want his shame touching that pity. \u201cA craft thing.\u201d\n\nHer face does something particular. \u201cBecause of the window,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBecause of hands,\u201d he says, surprising himself. \u201cBecause I\u2019d like to use them for things that are not this.\u201d\n\nShe nods slowly. \u201cYou want me to come and be the loud one in the corner so you can pretend you\u2019re there by accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cThanks. I want to go and be the quiet one in the corner because I can be.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll send you photos of crisps in honour of your absence.\u201d\n\nThe occurrence comes at three\u2014in the small cul-de-sac behind a shuttered off-license where all the bins have been overturned as if some enormous animal passed through and was affronted by the smell. The lad in the tracksuit is sixteen and has blood on his knuckles, not quite his own. There are five boys and the shape of a fight that could have been much worse. Owen stands between and not between, a positioning that is second nature now, and speaks in a tone he sometimes recognises as being not his but borrowed from an old PE teacher who smoothed everything with a joke until somebody cried.\n\nOne of the boys wears a paper crown from Christmas. It is March, but his face is a winter that never finished. The crown sits at a chaotic angle and splits when he lurches. It spills down past his ear like some indecisive petal. Normally, Owen would miss it. Normally he wouldn\u2019t, but he would not name it. This time his eyes catch and keep it and it feels like a sign in a language he is just starting to learn.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d he says, and the boys are relieved. Relief is the unmentioned agreement at these moments. Everyone wanted out. No one wanted to be the one who said so.\n\nThey take statements and call two sets of parents who arrive so full of breath and opinions that the small yard is brimming. Words are said about school and about what certain boys are and are not like. Someone says \u201cferal\u201d with a satisfaction he does not like at all. In the quiet after, all the boys gone, the bins upright again, the air smelling faintly of stale beer and wet cardboard and a little of fear, he pulls the paper crown from the gutter. He does not bag it. He folds it into a square. He puts it in his pocket.\n\nBy five, the light is falling over the rooftops like a shirt shrugged off and left on the back of a chair. He stands in front of the narrow staircase to the room above Paper & Thread and thinks about not going in. The thought is a small, neat square in his chest. He could take it out and unfold it and read it: stay away, people might look. People always look. But people always look. And then they look somewhere else.\n\nHe climbs and his foot hits the edge of a step that is not as deep as all the others and he thinks, in that superstitious way you think when something is almost not touched at all: if the step had been full size, I might not have noticed it, and I might be someone else. The door at the top opens before he can knock. Katie has hair in a knot and long, gluey fingers. Her jumper is the colour of a pond in May.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the window man,\u201d she says.\n\nHe is too tired to be embarrassed. \u201cI might be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re somebody else, you\u2019re still welcome.\u201d She stands aside. \u201cWe\u2019ve got tea and a plate of biscuits that are pretending not to be stale.\u201d\n\nThere are five other people in the room. Two women of retirement age who look like cousins and have brought identical bags with seaside scenes on them. A boy of about eleven who is accompanied by an aunt or an older sister, who has a kind face with firm edges. And a man with a beard who looks like he is here under the cover of supporting somebody else who did not, in the end, come.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing peonies,\u201d Katie says, \u201cbecause peonies are basically glamour crumpled up. We\u2019ll start with templates so no one panics. Panic is available if required, but best done quietly.\u201d\n\nThey sit. He sits. He is like a very tall book leaning itself casually at the end of a shelf, his knees not sure where to go. Katie layers tissue in her hands\u2014pale cream, a pink that makes him think of the inside of a seashell, a darker crimson, a ridiculous ultraviolet that he chooses immediately because somebody has to. The paper is thin as breath but not fragile. It is strong in the way webs are.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Katie says. \u201cThis is the trick. It\u2019s not really a trick. Twist the middle like a tiny sweet. Then pinch. Then you make a crease and the crease is your friend even if it looks like a mistake.\u201d\n\nHe has never thought of a crease as a friend. In evidence bags, in shirts hung from door handles, in old photographs with the line across the boy\u2019s smile where someone once folded the memory in half and put it in the back of a drawer\u2014lines have been borders, endings. He pinches the tissue. He twists. It feels like he\u2019s wringing out a thought.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Katie says, looking at his hands with the kind of patience that makes him want to be teachable. \u201cPeople think flowers are symmetrical and perfect. They\u2019re not. They\u2019re extravagant and wrong. That\u2019s why they\u2019re interesting.\u201d\n\nThe woman who came with the boy says, \u201cI always thought peonies were just roses if they\u2019d had too much gin,\u201d and the boy snorts and the man with the beard lets out a sound that might be the beginning of a laugh before he remembers himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Owen,\u201d he says, because not saying your name in a small room feels like wearing a mask at a children\u2019s party.\n\n\u201cKatie,\u201d she says again. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Mrs. Glass and that\u2019s Mrs. Also-Glass, and that\u2019s Ro and his aunt Min, and that\u2019s Greg who will probably tell you about boats if you ask him anything at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do boats,\u201d Greg says. \u201cI can do rudders and things for keeping water out.\u201d\n\nThe paper rustles like snow that would rather be rain. He folds and pinches and breathes in glue and the soft wild smell of the dyes. His first attempt looks like the aftermath of a cake fight. His second looks like something a bird might sit on if desperate. His third is a peony only in that it is not a table or a chair. Katie takes it, fluffing with her fingers like a barber waking up a haircut. \u201cThere you are,\u201d she says. \u201cYou let it be messy. It does the rest.\u201d\n\nHe puts his flowers on the table and a hush happens in him. It is not dramatic. It is a small room made in a larger room. He has made something that is not evidence or advice or a report or a chase. It is barely a thing and yet his hands say: yes.\n\n\u201cWho are you when you\u2019re not folding paper?\u201d Min asks him, carefully not making it sound like a question that can end a day.\n\nHe swallows. He has practiced the joke you practice when you have this job. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person who walks round with heavy keys and makes people\u2019s kitchens look smaller. I\u2019m a policeman.\u201d\n\nThe boy, Ro, says \u201cDo you have a gun?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cJust a sarcasm launcher. It\u2019s tethered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that dangerous?\u201d\n\n\u201cMostly to the operator.\u201d\n\nMrs. Also-Glass says, \u201cMy Trevor was a policeman. He did the phone calls to tell people things.\u201d She looks down at her flower and says, \u201cHe was good at that and not good at coming home.\u201d\n\nKatie looks at him and then doesn\u2019t, which is a kindness he appreciates utterly. They work until the plate is only sugar and crumbs and all the tea has become brown with the dust of being left to think too long. Ro makes a peony that is almost a dahlia and calls it a hero flower because it didn\u2019t mind being wrong. Owen makes five, because the movements have become, if not graceful, at least something he can trust his muscles to remember for longer than the moment.\n\nThe man with the beard, Greg, says, \u201cI drive to Minehead sometimes. To look at the edge. You can see the water thinking.\u201d\n\nMin says, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t think, love.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt thinks more than I do,\u201d he says.\n\nWalking back down the narrow steps, Owen has the carefulness of a person carrying eggs up a hill. In a box is the flower he will never give to his mother. He knows it sounds like a stage direction from a play you would roll your eyes at. He knows what it is, and he does not mind.\n\nOn the pavement, the air has become a compromise between rain and not rain. The butcher across the way is closing up, a string of sausages on a hook in the window like a necklace someone gave him as a joke. The butcher sees the box and says, \u201cWhat you got there then, Sarge? Valentines in March? Bit sad.\u201d\n\nOwen smiles a little. \u201cIt\u2019s paper,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cPaper,\u201d the butcher repeats, and adds, \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Straw. Is this a farm.\u201d\n\nHe moves on. Behind him the shop door clicks. At the corner by the bus stop a boy with a shaved head and shoes too white to have been worn in the rain says, \u201cYou Yardley?\u201d and there is a flinch in the name.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Owen says.\n\n\u201cSilas sent me,\u201d the boy says. He looks left and right even though that is, in itself, the shout of something being not quite on the level. \u201cWants you to know he doesn\u2019t have your watch. I don\u2019t know what that means. He laughed when he said it. He says you\u2019ll understand.\u201d\n\nIt is an old joke, a job from last year involving a box of spoons and a brave dog and a gullible burglar. Silas had palmed the watch from his wrist as if they were playing cards. Later, as if they were lovers. He had returned it with a handshake that felt like the chin of a statue. He always wanted to make a stage of things; to make a room into a story and put himself at the center of it. He is the kind of man who has learned both his best angles and his worst.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Owen asks.\n\n\u201cWhy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause someone gave you one.\u201d\n\nThe boy thinks about it and remembers his mother for long enough to say, \u201cAiden.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, Aiden. Tell him I understood. Tell him to stop sending children to see me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says you could do with someone to run for your lunch if you\u2019re so bothered by children.\u201d\n\nOwen smiles again. \u201cYou know what a life is? Not having someone else run for your lunch,\u201d he says, and it feels like he\u2019s talking to himself, to the younger one, to a version who would have liked that job because it is performing loyalty without having to mean it. He gives the boy a fiver. \u201cThis is not payment,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s for not standing in the road. Food goes a long way.\u201d\n\nAiden looks at the note as if it might bite him and then puts it so carefully into his pocket that it is, for a moment, moving. He nods and goes. In the reflection of the bus shelter glass, Owen sees himself holding the box of peonies and thinks, Christ. If this were a film I\u2019d be unbearable.\n\nAt home, the flat is the kind that estate agents call bright and a little quirky. It has a window that looks over the river and into someone else\u2019s window where a woman waters a plant that might be plastic. He puts the peony box on the table and stands making small adjustments to the petals that no one else will ever notice. He could not stop his mother dying. He could not fix his sister\u2019s dry, very private grief. He could not undo the way the job takes a little bite from his sense of humour every day. But he can make this. It is not a victory. It is not even a battle. It is a small thing in a room that otherwise holds practical things with plugs.\n\nHis phone vibrates with a text. It\u2019s Maeve. Did you do your paper oath, she writes. Are you now a priest.\n\nHe writes back, I am now Chief Superintendent of Tissue. Bow down.\n\nShe sends three skull emojis and a photo of a packet of salt and vinegar with the caption: your loss is noted.\n\nAt two in the morning he wakes and the flat is all water noises. Somewhere a pipe taps its own skin to stay awake. He goes to the kitchen for water and is frightened by his own reflection, a flash of someone else\u2019s tired nemesis in the black glass. He has that dream again, the one where he has to write a sentence that matters with a pen whose ink keeps becoming water, then smoke, then paper itself. He wakes with his hand curled as if pinching something invisible.\n\nThe next day, a body that might be a murder and might be a poorly-timed heart problem sits in the centre of an upstairs room in a house on Greenway Avenue. The Queen Anne chair looks offended to be near death. The woman's hands are neatly folded on her chest, which no one did. Or maybe someone did. There is a paper flower on the mantle. A peony.\n\n\u201cEveryone has peonies,\u201d Maeve says, shaking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend like planks on walls. Like having a sign that says kitchen as if you were going to cook in the lounge by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is tissue,\u201d he says, and he hates that his voice is the voice of a man who has new knowledge and would like everyone else to sit up straight to hear it. \u201cThis is\u2026there\u2019s a wire inside. See.\u201d\n\nMaeve looks at him and smiles like a fox pretending to be a dog. \u201cYou are allowed to know things,\u201d she says. Then, quieter, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\nHe thinks of Katie\u2019s hands and her simple instructions and the way the paper answered to being touched like it was always going to be like that. He thinks of the window, of the crying man, of Aiden with his too-white shoes and the butcher leaning with his untidy contempt. He thinks of Silas Rook\u2019s boy in the bus shelter and what it means to have messengers in a small town that has only so many metres of pavement. He thinks of the stain on the dead woman\u2019s blouse that is tea and reached there because of a hand that shook or didn\u2019t shake. He thinks of all of it.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s a group in town making peonies.\u201d It is ridiculous. It is possibly obvious. He says it anyway. \u201cAnd I think I need to go and ask questions and not frighten people. And I think we should not tell Griggs yet because he will make his mouth do that thing.\u201d\n\nMaeve nods. \u201cThe mouthing. It is very tabletop.\u201d\n\nHe lifts the tissue paper flower with his gloved hand and studies the ribbon that binds it. There is a tiny tag. He reads aloud. \u201cLove K.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a store with a register,\u201d Maeve says.\n\n\u201cThere is.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course there is.\u201d\n\nBack at Paper & Thread, the bell above the door tries to ring in a demure manner and fails like a bullfinch wedged into a teaspoon. Katie looks up and does not look surprised. \u201cWho died?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask that,\u201d he says, and exhales. Then, \u201cA woman. She had one of yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh God,\u201d Katie says. Her hands flutter. \u201cWhich one.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeony. Cream.\u201d\n\n\u201cI make a lot of those,\u201d she says, and then, because she knows what it sounds like, she adds, \u201cThat\u2019s not me being\u2026 Oh you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d He shows her the tag. \u201cYou write your initials on them?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly for the classes where we box them up. Usually I put the customer\u2019s name because it makes people feel they\u2019re not just buying something probably made by a robot. That one was\u2026 last Thursday? I remember because I burned my fingertip with the glue gun and I had to do it with my left hand. So the K is wonky.\u201d\n\nHe looks. The K is a little drunk. The fact pleases him inordinately. It is not an AI-perfect K. It is a person letter. \u201cDo you keep sales records?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor classes,\u201d she says. \u201cYes. Not for individual bouquets because we\u2019re still on a cash bell-jar system since Izzy messed up the PayPal. Why. Is this\u2014Oh God.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing to do with the flower,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a window.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man in the window? He came back, you know. He bought a little bunch of bluebells for his daughter. She was wearing Spider-Man pajamas under her coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you say it like that,\u201d Owen says, \u201cas if things sometimes go right from offscreen.\u201d\n\nKatie smiles with only half of her mouth. \u201cThey do. And sometimes the wrong things also do that. You look tired. You need sleep and a ridiculous breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say there is never a later. He looks around at the shelves stacked with tissue like folded air and ribbon spools like little hard suns. It is a room made of patience. He leaves her with his card but not with the weight of his day, because that is his to carry and to put down in the correct rooms reserved for that purpose.\n\nAt his desk, Griggs is waiting with a pencil held in a way that suggests he is about to stab a piece of paper into obedience. \u201cYardley,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know what I like? I like officers who do their job and don\u2019t form passionate attachments to crafts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very attached to the stapler,\u201d Owen says.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Griggs says. \u201cRook has been seen near Priorswood with two of his choirboys and a van that may or may not belong to his cousin\u2019s cousin. We\u2019re told,\u201d and he makes quotation marks you can see in his voice even if his fingers don\u2019t do them, \u201cwe\u2019re told he\u2019s got a line on some very charming copper piping. Do copper pipes charm you, Yardley?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dream of them,\u201d Owen says.\n\n\u201cGood. Take Pond and get yourself charmed.\u201d Griggs looks at his hands and sighs. \u201cAnd for Christ\u2019s sake lose the paper on your sleeve. It looks like your laundry attacked you.\u201d\n\nOwen looks down. There is a tiny confetti of cream on his cuff, like he has been blessed by a very specific and benevolent weather. He brushes it off, then flicks his fingers in a silly little shake, as if to get rid of water. When he looks up, Maeve is watching him with a quiet expression that is too kind to hold eye contact with. He looks away first.\n\nAt Priorswood, the van is a van and the pipes are pipes and Silas Rook is not there. He is always not there precisely when you have made a plan to include him. He is a weather system. They do the necessary paperwork and let the paramedics tend to the man who cut his hand on a sharp end of pipe and tried to pretend his hand was not bleeding until he left a trail that made it impossible to pretend anything. There is a child watching from the upstairs window across the street, a curtain held back with exactly as much strength as can be applied without it becoming obvious.\n\nLater, at three, Owen sees Rook in the town centre as if Rook knew that three would be a time when Owen would be doing his thinking walk. He is outside the Castle Hotel, leaning on the wall like he was born to. He has a cup of coffee and a grin that looks like it has been ironed.\n\n\u201cYardley,\u201d he says, delighting in the syllables like a man who has won a raffle and is waiting for you to notice. \u201cYou look like someone\u2019s favourite schoolteacher. What\u2019s that about.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d Owen says, but his mouth says it like a joke. He thinks of the boy Aiden and the message and the watch and the way Rook never stands in the middle of a pavement. Always the edge, always the new angle. \u201cThere\u2019s a way of being, Silas, where you don\u2019t involve other people\u2019s children.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s an interesting philosophical claim,\u201d Rook says. \u201cYou live in a world where other people\u2019s children are like rain. They just happen to you. You should pick a different world if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sent a boy with a message. Don\u2019t do it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI employed a now very slightly richer courier,\u201d Rook says. \u201cHe said you gave him a fiver. Are you trying to outbid me? I\u2019d start a bit higher if I were you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing with you,\u201d Owen says, then ruins it by smiling.\n\n\u201cYou always are,\u201d Rook says, and drinks his coffee. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing for years, and you know what I found out last week? It\u2019s not even tennis. It\u2019s pelmanism. We turn over the same two cards and pretend to be surprised that they match.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened last week,\u201d Owen says, because Rook never says things he doesn\u2019t want you to pull.\n\n\u201cI joined a thing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think I\u2019ll let you find out by reading the paper like you pretended not to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou joined\u2026 a gym,\u201d Owen says, and Rook wriggles with pleasure.\n\n\u201cI joined a gym for my brain. Because my brain was lonely and keeps doing old routines. I thought, Silas, maybe don\u2019t. Maybe learn a new one. Maybe stop doing the thing where you put your hand in someone else\u2019s pocket and take something that doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201d\n\nOwen feels a laugh rise and refuses it. \u201cYou joined a cult.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hired a life coach,\u201d Rook says, calmly, and watches his face closely. \u201cDo you like it. Does it look good on me.\u201d\n\nHe thinks of the craft magazine and the peonies and the dead woman and all the boys in all the cul-de-sacs waiting for someone to choose a sentence for them. He thinks of Silas Rook with a life coach and what that would look like. The coach would have to be a person not afraid of the part of a man who does not want to be touched. The coach would have to have paper hands, strong as webs. It is absurd in the way that suggests it might, for ten minutes in a rare hour, be true.\n\n\u201cThis town,\u201d Owen says, in the tone of blessing you give to a relative who is wearing a swimming hat at Christmas, \u201cthis town.\u201d\n\nRook looks at him, and for a second there is a light he doesn\u2019t show anyone else. It says I am a person with a past, and I might want something different than the thing I have learned to want. It says a lot for a second. Then his mouth goes back into its proper place and he taps the cup with his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll send my man your watch,\u201d he says, smirking. \u201cWe can all be honest. I never had it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Owen says.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d Rook says, and strolls away, getting the last line as always, even when he admits to the mistake.\n\nIn the station, someone has written on the whiteboard in a fat green marker: who moved the stapler. Below it someone has written: grief. Then someone else: life coach.\n\nHe puts the peony on his desk. It looks ridiculous. Maeve looks at it and says, \u201cI had a teacher once who used to pin silk flowers to her cardigans because she liked looking like a sofa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I look like,\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cLike a man with a flower on his desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\n\nHe sits. The paperwork rustles. The phone rings. Somewhere a door closes too hard because that is how the person feels and the door is the only thing that won\u2019t mind. He writes the dead woman\u2019s name. He writes to Katie to ask if the tag jogs a memory. He writes Rook in the margin and underlines it and does not have a theory he can call elegant.\n\nAt five, when the light outside is the colour of tea with milk left in the cup, Griggs stands by his chair and looks at the flower as if it has made a remark. \u201cWe are not a party,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Owen says, without moving.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let your\u2026 hobbies\u2026 bleed,\u201d Griggs says. \u201cYou let anything bleed enough it becomes the whole room. I don\u2019t want to stand in a room and find myself drowning in someone\u2019s embroidery.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s paper,\u201d Owen says.\n\n\u201cEverything is paper,\u201d Griggs says. \u201cUntil it burns.\u201d\n\nAfter, he goes to the river and leans on the railing like a cliche that has forgiven itself. A little group of teenagers share a bag of chips and talk about a teacher\u2019s boots as if they are a political scandal. A boy throws a stone and misses the water and looks around to see if the stone itself is going to laugh. The peony sits in a ridiculous and beloved fashion in his pocket, warm from his hand. He tries to imagine Rook sitting in a circle talking about values with a person in a sweater. He tries to imagine it with kindness. He fails, but not entirely. A gull shouts and the sky answers with a shift of grey that could be a promise or could be nothing at all.\n\nIf he is honest\u2014and he is not always\u2014he likes the feeling of the paper against his palm. He likes the way something thin as breath can be encouraged into a shape you can name. It is not control. It is not rescue. It\u2019s softer. He doesn\u2019t have a word for it yet. He tells himself language will catch up. It has to. It always does, eventually. It always does, until it doesn\u2019t.\n\nAnd in a house on Greenway Avenue a ribbon hangs from a mantle, missing its weight. And in a salvage yard called Rook & Rooke a man with a scar through his eyebrow looks at his own hands and thinks: these could be used for something that is not making doors open. And in a small room above a shop that smells of tissue and glue, a woman writes down names on a list and underlines one because she knows that people who bring their shoulders down off their ears for an hour might need a reason to come again. And in the station on Shuttern the night collects itself in the pigeonholes, as it always does, ready for the shift to change, and the town leans into the next thing the way a cyclist leans into a curve, hoping for balance, almost finding it, sometimes falling anyway.",

The house holds still as if taught to, the kind of semi-detached that looks like it was built to accept sensible conversations and wipeable grief. They do the door again because they always do the door again, the ritual of the threshold a way of admitting there was a before and now there is an after. The hallway smells faintly of lavender polish and the breath of carpets that have known slippers. On the console table is a bowl with a handful of coins and a postcard from Weston-super-Mare showing the pier in a light so artificial it has failed into romance. The Queen Anne chair in the front room remains affronted in the way certain furniture becomes when the human story decides to do something inconvenient on its watch. The woman is still, more very asleep than anything else, except for the tiny wrongs\u2014colour, temperature, the way the spine negotiates gravity when it is done pretending to be a string attached to a kite. The peony from the mantel is in a bag now with a little card stapled and numbers that turn the word flower into a line of a report. The ribbon that once held it is hanging like a small fete that didn\u2019t come off.\n\nThe pathologist does the small, tender work that makes television lie. He does not announce a time of death like a man opening a parcel to a room of people waiting to be pleased. He looks at wrists and nails and the inside of the lips where bruises begin talking before they are noticed. He speaks in little fractions because the body at this point is a fraction of what it was. \u201cNatural,\u201d he says, and then corrects himself because precision is a form of love. \u201cProbably natural. Underlying. But there\u2019s a bruise here that wants a story. Maybe a fall. Maybe a wrist held. Maybe nothing.\u201d He looks at the left wrist and the pale blank where a watch lived its life for a long time and now is elsewhere. He doesn\u2019t write burglary. He doesn\u2019t write theft. He writes absence and leaves it for other rooms with other people to decide what absence means.\n\nMaeve does her dance through the rooms, her notebook a net that catches the fish that want to be caught and several minnows that will be let go later because scale matters. \u201cMilk in the fridge,\u201d she says in the tone she reserves for evidence hiding in plain sight. \u201cHalf a pint. Sell-by two days ago. Tea stains on two mugs. Both with lipstick\u2014one a mauve that wants to be brown and one defiant carnival pink. She didn\u2019t have guests in mauve lipstick. Or did she repaint her mouth between mugs.\u201d The bedside table holds two blister packs that have surrendered one pill each but at different hours. A knitted shawl hangs on the end of the bed like a note in a soft language. In the kitchen the radio is on at a whisper, some presenter being too cheerful for a morning that hadn\u2019t been asked to accommodate any cheer at all. On the fridge door there is a magnet with the phone number of a taxi firm and a babysitter\u2019s flyer with perforated tabs; none of the tabs have been taken, which has always felt like a quiet little sadness to Owen, as if the babysitter has been waiting in a room for years, her hair done for nothing.\n\nHouse-to-house is a choreography with tea. A neighbour in a lilac fleece does that thing where she begins a sentence with \u201cFunny thing, actually,\u201d and the funny thing is interesting but not independently capable of carrying us to a conclusion. She saw a man about a week ago who might have been a son or might have been the Internet; he brought in shopping with the way of somebody embarrassed to be holding bags. Another neighbour who has barbeque utensils in a bucket by the back door offers the idea that a white van without signage is, all white vans are, practically a confession. It isn\u2019t helpful and he will gladly repeat it to the tape recorder if asked. A woman two doors down says the dead woman used to be a teaching assistant and then became not that when her knees failed to be excited by flight of stairs, and she spent a great deal of time writing to the council about hedges becoming more than hedges. As with all people who are newly dead, the town is gently editing her into a story that sounds as if everyone involved had a plan.\n\nFamily arrive in pieces because that is how families work, one person already halfway through the day\u2019s argument, another ready to be reasonable, one with their phone as a shield and one with naked hands. The daughter, whose name is Laura and who has a council lanyard in her pocket that she touches without putting on, stands in the hallway and swallows back a year\u2019s worth of unmade calls. She is wearing a jacket that is supposed to look smart and a pair of boots that knew a much younger December. She looks at Owen as if he is an electrician who has come to mend a socket and she is embarrassed that her whole house is on fire. \u201cShe was fine,\u201d Laura says, and the word fine looks as if she has made it out of aluminium foil, pressed neat, and it is crumpling in her hands already. She names the second mug\u2019s lipstick. \u201cThat will have been Wendy. Thursdays. Wendy brings pink. Mum hates pink and drinks it anyway out of politeness.\u201d The watch gets its own little scene. \u201cMum\u2019s watch,\u201d Laura says, before the question reaches the room. \u201cShe never took it off, even in the bath. She said time was the thing that got away the fastest and she wanted to hold something that had it in.\u201d When asked if anyone would take it she blinks, offended by the verb but bound to consider it. \u201cNo. I mean\u2014who would. Maybe she put it down. Maybe she\u2014I don\u2019t know. Maybe nothing.\u201d\n\nThe tag in the bag with the peony is reproduced in Owen\u2019s head when he closes his eyes. Love K, written by a left hand pretending confidence. A list of names at Paper & Thread will be ordinary in the way that lists are. It will have Karens and Kates and a Kelly who spells it with a single l because her mother thought that looked continental. He thinks of the way Katie had said \u201cI burned my finger,\u201d and how the small change in pressure on a pen turned a letter into a different animal. He thinks he might be constructing a puppetry of coincidence because it pleases him to imagine that the world is made of handholds.\n\nAt the shop, mid-morning, tissue paper is a weather, squares being lifted and lowered like very obedient flags. The bell on the door produces its strangled finch noise and Katie looks up the way a person looks up when they know a person will be there and they have already prepared their face to receive them. He shows her a photograph of the tag taken on his phone through plastic. \u201cLeft hand K,\u201d she says immediately, in the tone of a person pointing at themselves caught in their own CCTV. \u201cI did that. Thursday, just before closing. A portly man with a wonderful tweed waistcoat and a grief that had clearly come out in the wrong order said he couldn\u2019t do the loops with his fingers and would I write it. I said what\u2019s the name and he said K, just K, make it love K, and I made a joke about James Bond\u2019s quartermaster and he didn\u2019t get it but he laughed anyway because he wanted me to feel I hadn\u2019t embarrassed both of us.\u201d She flicks past the part where she burned herself because that is not the kind of detail that wants to be centre stage. \u201cHe paid cash out of a change purse, which is adorable in a man over forty if you don\u2019t think too deeply about why, and he smelled like boiled sweets and old cigarette smoke. Hair like sheep\u2019s wool. He said the lady liked cream because it didn\u2019t show the dust.\u201d She winces because she has said lady and not woman and she thinks she might be judged, and then she sees she is not.\n\n\u201cDid he give a name for K,\u201d Owen asks, and her head shakes while she returns ribbon spools to a drawer that is trying to quarrel with her about how full it should be. She is writing the shape of the man in her mind and cannot find a detail that will be decisive without making him into a caricature. \u201cI can draw his nose,\u201d she says, and laughs because that sounds like a threat. She searches under the till for previous day\u2019s scrap paper because Paper & Thread is run on the belief that the world will keep track of small, nice things if given chance. She produces a receipt with nothing on it except a drawn loop that might have been her hand practicing the K until it was something she would be prepared to let go of. \u201cSorry. That\u2019s nothing. That\u2019s not helpful.\u201d Then she adds, \u201cHe held the peony like it was a baby hedgehog. I liked him for that. If he did wrong in your world, he didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d\n\nOutside in the blowy light you only get over the river, there is a noticeboard behind glass with fading event flyers arranging themselves into a calendar of optimism. Owen ticks through with his eyes because walls tell stories when enough of them have been used for notices. Crochet for Cancer, Wednesday nights. Mindful Parenting, first Monday. Men in Sheds, ongoing. There, between a pastel poster with a cupcake and a yoga class advertised by a woman who could hold a plank for a month, is a handbill for Clarity Coaching with Ken Wright BA (Hons), MA (PosPsych), letters like credentials that can be laid like ammunition. Find your what by finding your why, it says. Ladder your goals. Saturdays at the Quaker Meeting House, one-to-ones by appointment, be seen, be heard, be well. There is a number and a photo of a man with a smile practiced in a mirror that has been told to be honest. The initial in the name is the one that has been living in his head all morning. There are only so many K\u2019s a town can keep in stock.\n\n\u201cWhat have you got,\u201d Maeve asks when he returns, shaking rain off herself as if it is an opinion she didn\u2019t ask for. He shows her Ken Wright\u2019s face and she groans with respect. \u201cOf course he is called Ken,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a very particular kind of Ken. He has a whiteboard he wheels and a marker he treats like a wand. He says content-free sentences about journeys and sees the tears as confirmation the journey has begun. Don\u2019t make that face, Owen. I know you have recently discovered your heart is a large origami swan and you want to be kind. Ken will test you.\u201d He tells her Katie\u2019s description of the man with the tweed and the boiled sweets smell and they both conjure three different people from the description and none of them feels like the one. \u201cHe could be a choir master or the man who calibrates scales in chemists,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s either loved by a village or feared by all his grandchildren. We shouldn\u2019t be making a pantomime. But also I would pay to watch him audition for one.\u201d\n\nThe woman on Greenway Avenue acquires a name that fits her better than dead woman. Her name is Marion Vale and she used to file the library books under the wrong categories on purpose when de-shelving annoyed her because she liked the idea that someone might find a dictionary in Local History and be tempted to read it. She has a daughter Laura who would do anything for her mother and a son between jobs who is bad at Auntie cards and good at taking bins out without being asked. She has a friend Wendy who wears carnival pink and fills Thursday afternoons with gossip that is kinder than gossip pretends it will be. Marion has a watch that is missing and a peony that is a curiosity, and a bruise on the wrist that refuses to pick a team. Owen and Maeve sit with Laura in the little conservatory that was never quite sure why it was added and drink tea that tastes like it has been asked to make a point. \u201cThere was a man,\u201d Laura says, as if bringing something to a table and apologising for the size. \u201cNot a man like a story ought to have. A man like an envelope. He came two weeks ago with a leaflet. Mum said he was a very smooth person. He told her talking helps and she told him to sell his talk where the talk-hungry are.\u201d She looks at the leaflet on the sideboard and pushes it towards them with one finger, reluctant to touch it twice. Ken Wright\u2019s overly sincere face looks up from its gloss. The initial sits there as if it had applied to be in their afternoon and had been accepted. \u201cHe had that notepad,\u201d Laura says, \u201cthe slim one like you have if you are trying to look like you are not taking notes but you are taking notes. He looked at Mum\u2019s hands as if he was going to tell them to relax. She didn\u2019t like that at all.\u201d\n\nBy the time they reach the Quaker Meeting House the afternoon looks grey in the way a dishcloth looks grey after enthusiasm has been taken from it. The board outside says There is something of God in everyone, in careful temporary letters you can wipe off with a damp cloth if the world complains too loudly. Ken Wright arrives between one breath and the next, wearing a jacket the colour of wet cardboard and shoes that are new enough to have just a little retail shop in them still. He is shorter than his photo would like him to be and his smile has borrowed something from the way doctors smile in dramas just before giving either excellent or terrible news.\n\n\u201cOfficers,\u201d he says, and the word has the game-show flourish of a man who learned to include people by naming them. \u201cCome to find your why.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome to find your Ken,\u201d Maeve says, and he does a laugh that shows the effort he is willing to make for strangers to feel charming. He is not unpleasant on purpose. He is rehearsed and that is its own kind of warning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking about contact with Marion Vale,\u201d Owen says. \u201cTwo weeks ago you were in her house. We know because the universe has a habit of telling on us with bits of paper.\u201d\n\nKen does his serious-man face, the one he thinks will reassure them that he keeps his heart in a responsible place. \u201cI run a group for the bereaved,\u201d he says, \u201camong other things. I do workplaces and couples and grief and getting up in the morning and the midlife thirty-six-hour stare. Marion called me a twit which is a word I have a lot of time for, and I said I accept that designation, and then we talked about hedges for fifteen minutes. She asked if I was going to charge her for the hedges chat. I said no, because I\u2019m not a bastard.\u201d He looks at Owen as if to gauge whether bastard is the kind of word he can say in this conversation. Owen\u2019s face does not contradict him but does not give him encouragement to add a stronger one. \u201cI did not sell her anything,\u201d Ken continues. \u201cShe did not want me to exist in her week.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you know she died,\u201d Maeve asks, two beats late to stop him framing his answer to another, less solemn question. His mouth opens to do the oh no face and his forehead remembers it has muscles for that. Even if it is performance, it is conscientious performance. \u201cI saw something on the Facebook group for the street,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t do Facebook but my assistant compiles a digest because people gossip where they live. Terrible. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t think\u2014obviously we need to think\u2014but I don\u2019t think my chat about hedges did it.\u201d\n\nOwen finds he wants not to dislike him and then becomes suspicious of that wanting as if it is an advert trying to sell him bread he already has. \u201cDo you know a gentleman,\u201d he says, \u201cof an age to have bought a small change purse and an inclination to admit it in public. Tweed waistcoat. Sheep wool hair. Smelt of boiled sweets he does not share. Bought a paper flower from a shop and asked for it to be labelled \u2018Love K\u2019.\u201d\n\nKen does three small expressions to process the many details he has been handed. He is good at this; he has sat in rooms where people have thrown the contents of their day at his face and he has had to find the thread that would make them feel stitched into their own lives. \u201cMr. Kettle,\u201d he says, and looks quietly proud of his memory. \u201cHe comes to my Tuesday mornings and tells me to stop calling him Mr. Kettle because it makes him feel like a black-and-white kitchen. Kevin Kettle, but nobody calls him Kevin because he is perfectly made for his surname. He does indeed wear tweed in seasons that do not require it and he has the sugar habit you have observed. He has a pocket full of barley sugar, I swear he does it because it makes him feel like a Victorian who\u2019s allowed to take tigers on walks. He looks after a woman called Elsie who is his neighbour and who has an awful habit of falling over in shops. He is always doing love Ks because he thinks first names are intimate and last names are rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould Mr. Kettle buy a flower for Marion Vale,\u201d Owen asks, and Ken tilts his head like a dog who has been asked why, philosophically, fetch is relevant to the human condition. \u201cHe does gifts,\u201d Ken says. \u201cHe is the kind of person who, when a pain happens in a radius of streets around him, puts a small object in the pain\u2019s immediate vicinity to make it feel like the world has noticed. His ethics are fine if this is about ethics. He is a man with a key to many people\u2019s houses and nobody has ever had the key cut back to a single because they mind. He will have done the bin for her without telling her. He will have fixed her doorbell and then told her it was a fairy. Please don\u2019t kick him for being helpful. I know helpful can also be a mask. But with him it is not a mask that wants to be a thief.\u201d\n\nMaeve and Owen exchange a look that is not a decision but is the prelude to one. They will knock on Mr. Kettle\u2019s door with biscuits because certain men need nine minutes of chat before a question will sit in the room without making them proud. They will see the barley sugars rolled into the corner of a drawer and they will see a little saucer for coins by the key stand and they will think indecently that it is nice to be right when it doesn\u2019t cost anyone.\n\nThey go anyway to Rook & Rooke because there is a drum in Owen\u2019s chest that plays Silas even when the orchestra has been told to pack up. The salvage yard smells of damp paint and the iron in blood and sometimes of a lost fry-up. Silas is not at the front; he never is when a polite conversation would suit everyone concerned. He is somewhere in his labyrinth of municipal chairs and radiators that wanted one more life. A boy with a face like a church step looks up from an angle grinder with the solemn intensity of someone who has just learned what an angle is. \u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d the boy says, which is nearly always true and therefore always suspicious. Owen walks farther in because there is a degree to which waiting for Silas in his own rooms is like asking a trickster to send you a postcard.\n\nHe appears with a piece of brass in one hand that looks like it came from a ship that sank for a very dramatic reason. He does a look that is almost shy and then forgets to make it into arrogance. \u201cHave you seen my watch,\u201d he says, pleased to revisit an old line, and Owen doesn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of giving him the history he wants. \u201cDo you know Ken Wright,\u201d he asks, and Silas laughs as if asked whether he knows electricity. \u201cHe told me to breathe,\u201d Rook says. \u201cImagine. Someone had to tell me to do that. I told him I like to outsource the regular jobs. He wrote the word outsized by mistake and kept it. He has a whiteboard like your colleague guesses, the quiet one with the hands who could probably make a swan out of a receipt and make the swan think about its life choices. Is he in your book. Is Ken a suspect. He\u2019d love that. He\u2019d word-cloud himself to death.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go to his group,\u201d Owen says. \u201cSaturdays.\u201d\n\n\u201cI go where biscuits are,\u201d Rook says. \u201cI go because I have an enquiring mind. He tells us to do body scans which is a very silly name for closing your eyes and noticing that your shoulders do not live at the tops of your ears. My shoulders are renting extra rooms in my skull. He told me to let them out and I told him my deposit was non-returnable.\u201d He puts the brass on the table with the carefulness of a man who has held objects that were once valuable to someone else and cannot forget that fact however hard he tries to style it out. \u201cYou worried you cannot like a man who tells other men to breathe,\u201d he asks, and Owen feels too seen for a second and resents it. \u201cI am worried,\u201d Owen says, and it is a considered sentence, \u201cabout people collecting other people\u2019s need and spending it badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a policeman,\u201d Rook says. \u201cYou live in that economy.\u201d\n\nThere are days when he does not entirely know why he doesn\u2019t hit Silas Rook in the face and then remember. Hitting him would be an admission that his sentences are objects you can catch and he is not going to juggle on Silas\u2019s stage. He says that they have a man named Kettle on their list to talk to and watches Silas\u2019s eyebrows take the information and file it under Not Immediately Useful to Me. Rook picks imaginary fluff from his sleeve and does the thing where he flips the conversation into a joke that wants to be an exit. \u201cYou\u2019re making peonies now,\u201d he says. \u201cIt suits you. Something about your mouth looks less like it is holding an alarm between its teeth. I like it when men do pretty things and do not apologise for being alive while doing them. Bring one to my yard and I\u2019ll try not to set fire to it to make a point.\u201d\n\nThe appointment with Mr. Kettle is half an hour of happiness disguised as a lecture on grids. He has a doormat that says Not Today and a collection of Victorian Cyanide Poison warnings framed in the loo because he says it reminds him not to put the wrong thing in anyone else\u2019s tea. He is the kind of man who calls Owen \u201cmy dear fellow\u201d and actually means dear and fellow in some old kind way. There are sweets in every room in little pressed glass bowls that have known many Christmases and have probably survived a house move like soldiers. He proudly shows them his change purse that has a snap you cannot buy anymore, he says, unless you know a woman called Beryl who deals in these things and is likely to outlive them all. He has the need to explain why he writes Ks when he does not know if he has been accused of anything. \u201cKevin,\u201d he says, and his cheeks do a flutter that is nearly a blush. \u201cI don\u2019t like Kevin. It has always made me feel like I am about to be called to the front of a class to spell something I already know I cannot spell. So K. Love K. It\u2019s ridiculous at my age but also life is ridiculous at my age and therefore there is a compatibility.\u201d He bought the peony for Marion last week, he says, because she was cross about hedges and there is no better treatment for hedge crossness than a thing that is aggressively not a hedge. He handed it to Wendy because Wendy likes to be the bringer. He has never been in Marion\u2019s house without permission and not even then because he doesn\u2019t like to catch people in their rooms with their mouths unbraced.\n\nHe speaks about Ken with the resigned affection of a man who has accepted a doctor for an ailment he isn\u2019t sure he has. \u201cHe tells me I should stop collecting people\u2019s shopping trolleys,\u201d he says. \u201cHe says I cannot push everyone\u2019s trolley to the coin return, and I say I can, and then the next week I bring him a tally. He is trying to be kind. He does it in a tone that reminds me of small sermons, but he does not take your money while he does it unless you give it with both hands, which I do, because I like a room where the tea is hot and nothing is thrown.\u201d He has no beef with anyone alive, and yet he carries himself like a man who has been armed with a sense of duty since he was nine. It is hard to file that under suspect and then it is irresponsible to file it under harmless; men who seem like saucers can carry knives like anyone else.\n\nThe day does that settling down thing where the town puts on the lights it can afford and hopes the rest will make its own arrangements. The paperwork is a tide coming in behind him and Owen allows himself to be stood in it up to the knees because if you pretend there is no water it still wets you. He puts the peony from the class on the shelf above his desk where past him used to put a football scarf in winter and a postcard from a seafront showing a painted donkey. Griggs passes by, sees the flower, opens his mouth to make a remark and then closes it again because the effort of forming the remark and the probable satisfaction once said will not pay for the ugliness it will leave afterwards. He says instead that Priorswood will want a visit because the copper pipe turned out to belong to a church undergoing a re-plumb and you cannot mess with churches even if you are a pagan about plumbing. On the whiteboard someone has added Paper K in green and someone else has put a question mark next to it that is so emphatic it has probably bruised the pen nib. The station smells of the coffee that has been made strong to prove a point and a portion of chips that has vanished in the time it takes to turn a wheel. The night men filter in with faces like people who have been told the punchline and are trying to frame their day as a setup that will justify it.\n\nAt home he does a strange thing that feels like cheating on the person he was last year. He clears a space on the table that most people would consider to be already empty and lays out tissue paper in squares like siding tiles on a house he will never own. His hands have learned to do the pinching without thinking but still require him to be present, which is a luxury. He teaches himself a leaf from a drawing he can find on the internet but doesn\u2019t because he has decided that it is possible to invent if you are willing to fail at something someone else could teach you in six minutes. The radio is a mumble in the corner and a man says the words of the day as if he is in charge of deciding what they mean. Owen makes three leaves that all look like they have been on different trees, which is fine with him because if they had agreed with each other it would have been a small lie. He puts the flower he never will give to his mother on the table with a new friend and the table does not notice, which is right, because he would like some things not to be enormous in the way that the world thinks they ought to be.\n\nHe does not sleep as a verb; he sleeps as a negotiation. His dream is a lecture hall with a craft table at the front, and he is required to stand and make peonies while explaining a case and every time he says the word motive the paper tears. He wakes in the grey that is not quite morning and goes to the window to watch the river not be about him, which is a discipline and a relief. A text from Maeve arrives with a photo of a leaflet for the Clarity group with the note: your boyfriend Ken is doing a weekend retreat. Do not attend unless you want to be told to tell your inner policeman to relax. He writes back that his inner policeman is too busy knitting and she sends an emoji that she would tell her nephew not to use.\n\nHe meets Katie again without meaning to because the town keeps its people like a handful of pebbles you think you have thrown and then find again in the pocket of an old coat. She is outside Paper & Thread chalking a sandwich board with a hand that can do italics without arrogance. She is writing, today: we are open and not in a hurry. Her hair has committed to being in the knot that it became by accident yesterday. He tells her about Marion in the edge-of-the-news way that he knows how to do now, careful to keep the details that would pull her into a room he can\u2019t close for her. \u201cWe have a Mr. Kettle,\u201d he says, and she brightens at the name as if she has been told a story she was already ready to enjoy. \u201cHe came in yesterday and asked me if I had a ribbon that looks like it knows how to behave itself,\u201d she says. \u201cI told him not a one. He bought the worst behaved ribbon I have and said excellent, that\u2019s what I like in a person.\u201d\n\nIf the world were the kind of world where you could smell coincidence, he would at this point have to sneeze. It is a small place. People like Ken identify the smallness and sell it back to you as intimacy. People like Silas exploit it as a map they can draw in versions that suit them. People like Mr. Kettle make it an economy of kindness. People like Marion live in it and ask it to be practical. People like Owen walk through it with heavy keys and try to keep all the doors honourably on their hinges.\n\nAt midweek there is a new event that is not dramatic in the way the newspaper likes to be fed but is the sort of thing that makes the strings on the map in the briefing room want to tug. There is a night-time taking-attempt from the back room of Paper & Thread and it is not the till, which is what you take when you are not acquainted with a person\u2019s looking. It is the boxes of wire and the good glue gun that has a chrome bit on it as if one day it knew what it was like to be a car. The lock is prised with an intelligence that is not refined but is confident. On the floor in the mess of tissue and ribbon is a shoe print that is a half-moon of bossing from a brand that sells itself on young men believing their ankles are doing something important. The world is like that\u2014a man will spend on ankle drama what he might not spend on lunch. Katie is shaken in the way of a person who finds the place where she keeps her sleep disturbed. She wants to tidy while talking and folds paper while worrying, which is like rain explaining itself.\n\n\u201cWhy take wire,\u201d Maeve asks out loud as if the wire might develop a conscience in response and arrange a return. Katie\u2019s answer is both craft and town. \u201cThe wedding over the weekend,\u201d she says, \u201cthe one at the rugby club with the backdrop that lights up, the lads used all my stock last-minute because the first lot went missing in the van crash. They told me I should be grateful because they paid cash, as if cash makes everything into a better story. I think someone saw me write down that I would order more and thought if I order and it arrives before I am here then this is the kind of shop that will prop its door with a broom and hope the world is good. Maybe someone wanted to try their hand at bending things. People like to play God with wire. It does the thing you want at speed, which is dangerous.\u201d\n\nInside that answer is a small shape Owen turns with his mind like a coin. Wire from a craft shop is cleaner and more predictable than the scrap at Rook\u2019s, which is a tangle of old fences and bits of bedsprings and something that once held a sign that said SLOW near a school. If he were to be a person with ambition for making a different thing that looks like a thing that ought not to exist, he would buy his wire new. He would want regularity, obedient length. He would want the cut to be clean. He does not say it because it is not yet a thought that has anywhere to sit. He logs the shoe print, he notes the lock, he tells Katie to get a camera that isn\u2019t insulting to the future and she says she already has one and it is cheerful yellow which is a choice she has made with hope.\n\nThat evening he takes Maeve to the Ken meeting because anything done with a witness is less likely to become an anecdote with sharp teeth. The Quaker room is all the calm you would give a person if they were afraid of today. The chairs are laid in a semi-circle less because semi-circles are optimal for learning and more because the person laying them wanted to feel less like they were arranging a jury. Ken writes on his whiteboard slowly as if afraid his pen will feel used, and his words are saying nothing new and managing to be what some people need and that contradiction is chewable if you don\u2019t mind the taste. Silas is there in the back making a face like a schoolboy and choosing not to hide from himself. Mr. Kettle is at the front with his hands on his knees and his absence of need arranged in a shape that will not frighten anyone. There is a woman who is trying not to be the crying person and a man who is too busy telling his own story in his head to hear anyone else\u2019s. There are biscuits and the least haughty tea he has tasted in a week and a poster that says today\u2019s you is okay. Ken says things about breath and noticing and the three-minute vacation you can give yourself if you sit in your car and listen to traffic without making any of it your fault. The part of Owen that mistrusts being told to notice things when he notices things for a living is belligerent. The part of him that has been doing pelmanism with Silas under the table for a decade relaxes anyway when someone else is allowed to say a sentence that is a soft landing. Maeve watches with the intent of a person who is going to take the piss later and then will make him bacon in the morning because she wants good outcomes.\n\nAfter, when coats find their arms and chairs return to their little lines, Ken tries a question as if trying a new tie. \u201cWhat do you do when you are not making sure we are not parts of a riot,\u201d he asks Owen, and the room manages that paradoxical attention where everyone is being polite about not looking and everyone wants to hear the answer. He says, \u201cI make paper peonies,\u201d because there is freedom in being ridiculous on purpose and he finds that he wants to root his week in something that isn\u2019t a filing system and a siren. The room breathes out in laughter that is not about him and he likes it for that. Silas says, \u201cOh good,\u201d and Ken, to his credit, doesn\u2019t turn it into a prompt about softness. He writes the word hobby on the board and then rubs a bit of it out absentmindedly and leaves hobb, and Owen watches the word more keenly than is sensible because it looks like a thing from a fairy story.\n\nBack in the street the night has decided what kind of dark it wants to be and it is the hospitable one with enough lamps. Owen can feel the case putting out little roots now, bits that will either make a plant given space and time or will die in the soil and nourish other worries. He has a Mr. Kettle who is a conduit. He has a Ken who gathers and therefore knows. He has a Katie who is in the vulnerable category of person you want to be friends with your whole life. He has a Silas learning to breathe in a group and making that fact make a noise. He has a watch-shaped nothing and the faintest whisper of a bruise. He has paper, which is silly and also ought not to be dismissed because sometimes the silly is the thing that makes the room bearable enough to do the serious.\n\nOn his way home, just for the satisfaction that being in motion brings, he cuts across the bus station and the weather is doing the thing with its sleeves again, rolling them up like it means to get involved. A boy is making aimless shapes with his bike and he is the kind of boy who has invented a way of making eye contact that doesn\u2019t risk it. It takes a second to recognise him without the posture of errands and a message, but then it is Aiden, shoes less white now, fewer sharp lines. He sees Owen and decides in an instant not to be someone else for the purposes of this conversation. \u201cThat thing the other day,\u201d he says instead of hello, and he means the five boys and the bins and the relief disguised as shouting. \u201cMy mum said if I see you to tell you she liked that you didn\u2019t say feral. She said a lot of people like that word too much. She says feral is a cat, not a person. She said,\u201d and he has to push this next bit out because he is sixteen and kind and the combination burns, \u201cshe said to tell you she is a person and it was a bad day and if you see her she will not run.\u201d Owen nods and says tell her I said sorry for the day being bad. Aiden leans on the bike like it feels like furniture he brought from home. \u201cI got a job,\u201d he says, which is not true, not yet, but it is an intention that is wearing boots. \u201cAt the yard. Not heavy work. Tidy work. Sorting work. The bald man said he would teach me the names of woods and I could maybe not steal them after if I know them. He\u2019s funny. He says he\u2019ll make a church boy of me. I don\u2019t know what that is. Do you.\u201d Owen thinks of Silas in the back of a Quaker room pretending to have invented breath and he laughs, and the night looks at him in a surprised way and does not report him to anyone for enjoying something.\n\nWhen he gets home, because the day has not finished and it will not until he decides to let it, he takes the peony from the shelf and attaches one of the leaves he made badly and the leaf sits there like a joke that landed anyway. He writes Marion\u2019s name in his book with care as if by writing it the right way he is paying a fee he has owed to the day. He writes Kettle, Ken, Katie, Rook, peony\u2014class\u2014and the act of putting the words near each other brings with it a small fizz, as if he has shaken something carbonated and now must decide whether to open it or leave it overnight to quieten. He writes watch and underlines it because watches mark you if you let them. Before sleep he texts Maeve: do not let Ken make me write my feelings on a post-it. She replies: he can\u2019t afford the amount of post-it that would require. He goes to bed and in the hour where he usually listens to the pipes practice their rhythms, he hears, very faintly, the town, leaning into a curve and getting around it with only a small wobble, and that, for one night, is enough.",

Owen stands with his coat half on and watches the rain make punctuation marks on the station\u2019s steps, commas and ellipses that can be read as either encouragement or delay depending on the reader. Maeve arrives with coffee that has considered being coffee and decided to remain an implication; she hands it over like a conspirator and shrugs out of her hood with the affronted dignity of a cat. Griggs passes through the foyer with a folder under his arm which is the shape all his optimism takes, and says in the general direction of everyone that the pathologist\u2019s preliminary says probably natural for Marion Vale and definitely inconvenient for the paperwork, then adds to the room at large that the watch is still a noun with no adjective and he would appreciate people going out into the world and supplying one.\n\nThey begin with the obvious because the obvious is not stupid until you have proved it is. Wendy lives in a terrace with a front garden that is more ornaments than soil, a collection of ceramic frogs that all have opinions. She wears her carnival pink in daylight the way some people carry a torch, to make dark corners belong to them, and she welcomes them in with the sort of energy that tells you she has already cried and is trying on three substitutes to see which will keep the day aloft. The house is middle-of-the-week tidy, which is to say the dishes are done and the cushions are behaving but nobody has performed theatre for strangers. She talks without being asked for a bit because silence is a muscle you have to warm up for, and when she is ready she says she took the peony last Thursday because it looked like luxury you could put your thumb through, and she put it on the mantel and made a joke about it being the one flower Marion would never kill by forgetting water. She says Marion told her off for the ribbon being a bit much and then stroked the ribbon with two fingers like a person remembering a skirt she once had that swished.\n\nThey do the hour with Wendy in a way that makes time behave. She puts two mugs out and adds sugar without asking because it is easier to be told off for generosity than to anticipate the needs of strangers, and she sits and tries to picture Thursday in a way that will please them. She remembers the weather being the kind that cannot commit and the delivery man frustrated by his own existence and Marion\u2019s mouth set in a line that meant the council had annoyed her into eloquence. She does not remember the watch coming off because she never saw the watch off in ten years of Thursdays, which is a fact that hangs in the room like a polite ghost. There was a man at the door just before she left, she says, and then grimaces because that has the shape of plot when she is only telling them about a man who wanted to clear gutters and spoke as if he wanted to be believed as a career. He had a jacket in that particular hi-vis that looks tired even when new, and he had a clipboard you could have made at home. She told him she did the gutters personally up a ladder in heels and he said she was a card, and she said what kind of card, and he did not have the wit to answer, and she closed the door on his usefulness. It was ten to four, ish, because she had to pick up her granddaughter at four and she is a woman who watches the edges of hours.\n\nThey check the street\u2019s camera as if asking a wall to present a memory and the wall tries, offering them a slice of world with the colour taken down a notch. There is a van that could be any van and a man who could be a hundred men, the sort of shape that the universe produces when it is tired of people and wants only silhouettes. He walks quickly because walking slowly invites chat, and his hood is up not because of weather but because anonymity is a habit. They can\u2019t see his face and they can\u2019t see his clipboard and still a feeling moves across both of them at the same time, the feeling you get when life repeats itself in little, irritating ways. Halcon had a man with a clipboard who knew the sound a tin of meter coins makes even through a cupboard door and had a way of being as domesticated as a wolf can look through glass.\n\nOn the way back they stop in a shop that deals in things the previous generation used to call valuables and now we have learned to call sentimental because only one of those names pays. The pawnbroker has glasses that have seen everything and refuse to be impressed by it twice, and he leans on the counter and makes them a world-weary cup of tea without offering milk because he has learned to be a neutral host. The description of Marion\u2019s watch is too precise to be interesting\u2014it is the kind of watch that tells the time and disapproves of novelty\u2014and he listens like a man who likes a story even if he cannot sell it. He shakes his head and then says a thing that is not no, not exactly; a man brought in a watch yesterday that had a back engraved, and pawnbrokers do not love engraved things because they carry too much biography. The man made a face when he was told the engraving made it a problem of belonging, and the man had the particular angry carefulness of someone who wants to appear not angry. He had a beard that wished it was an argument and a jacket that once belonged to a better man. He gave the name Dave because of course he did and left the watch in a pocket as if it was the sort of pocket that doesn\u2019t make things more complicated the longer they stay.\n\nThey do the rounds of the scrap-yards and the small shops where cash still behaves like a cousin you can borrow things from, and the watch has not presented itself like a dog that knows its own name. It is an absence that keeps being itself. On a side street just past the barbers that calls itself a lounge, Maeve slows to look at a poster for Chair Yoga with a woman sitting in a chair like a person who has decided elegance can compromise if it wants to. \u201cShe teaches on Thursdays,\u201d she says, and she points with her chin because her hands are busy with a thought. \u201cThe hall two minutes from Greenway. If Marion wasn\u2019t for Ken with his whiteboard she might have been for a woman who offers to move with your bones rather than against them.\u201d It is nothing more than weather until it is something else, and they put it on a mental list because their physical lists already insist they are at capacity.\n\nBack at Paper & Thread, the aftershock of the attempted break-in is still in the room like someone\u2019s breath, a temperature change and an untucked corner. Katie has done the thing a certain kind of person does when shaken by the way the world insists on being itself; she has arranged everything more perfectly than yesterday, as if kindness to objects can talk the air out of a bad mood. The lock is a new lock because she has a friend who is a locksmith or is in love with one, and the camera at the back is now a little yellow bird with a black pupil, brighter than anything else in the alley. She does not ask for an update on Marion because she is afraid that an update turns you into the sort of person who is entitled to one, and that is not who she wants to be. She asks instead about the shoe print, and when they tell her it is a brand of trainer that smells of lunchtime fights and birthday money, she nods because she knows it was a child-man and she knows how children wear menace like an oversized coat.\n\nOwen kneels and fixes the cable run for the camera with the kind of carefulness he gives to everyday things he respects and sometimes forgets to respect. He asks about the order that went missing for the rugby club and she snorts and says the lads wanted to build a backdrop that made the room forget what it was, and when one of them knocked her card machine off the counter with his enormous romance she made them pay in notes. He asks without asking if anyone new has been interested in wire and she says yes, a man with not a lot of hair and an interest in his own elbows came in two days ago and asked how much wire it would take to make a forest, which is the kind of thing men who want to test you say, and she said depends on your trees. He didn\u2019t buy anything because he was there to learn how to speak her language and left with three words and a picture of the till in his head. It is not Silas because Katie would have said Silas; she is a woman who uses names like stepping stones when she crosses a stream.\n\nIn the afternoon they sit at their hot desk purgatory and eat things that insist they were food based on paperwork alone. The pathologist rings to say the bruise on the wrist is a shy thing that cannot quite decide what it wants to be when it grows up. It is small and oblong and in the place where watch straps pinch if a hand is snatched without courtesy, which is not proof but is a story a person can tell themselves about a last carefulness that became an indignity. He says there is nothing of hand on mouth and nothing of knee in a bad place and nothing that demands anyone be led away for a dramatic conversation with the custody desk. He says also that hearts are manufactories and they stop without warning when components get old under fluorescent lights, and that is not poetry and not not-poetry either.\n\nThey go and see Chair Yoga because the day has decided to be themed. The hall smells like tea and dust as if it has been faithful to an era longer than any of its users, and a row of women in cardigans that resemble clouds are doing very small things with their spines while a voice tells them they are doing magnificently. The instructor is younger than the women and older than the girls who will replace her, and she has the patience of someone who has watched people be furious with their own backs and forgiven them for it. She remembers Marion because Marion said the chair was a friend who had become boring and she was trying to be kind to a boring friend. She remembers Marion wearing the watch and tapping its face as if intimidating time into agreeing to behave, and she remembers no gutters man in that hour because the hall has a noticeboard where such men leave their leaflets, and she personally rips them down and gives them to the school for cutting out because the children do not care for scams yet. She knows Wendy because of course she does and she says of Wendy that she is a good weather system in a cold room.\n\nAt the Meeting House Ken is holding a one-to-one with a man who looks like a wardrobe whose shelves are overloaded, and he catches Owen\u2019s eye in the way of someone who would like to be seen to be helpful. They speak alleys and gutters with the shorthand of two people who have become temporary colleagues in a theatre where neither of them owns the stage. Ken tells him that three of his old ladies have had visitors lately with talk of water damage that is less about water and more about entering. He says he wrote down a plate number badly because he does his best thinking in loops and straight lines frighten him, and he offers the paper in his pocket that has two possible eights and a five that could be an S. There\u2019s a small satisfaction in being the recipient of someone else\u2019s care, even if it is chaotic care, and Owen takes the paper as if it is a guinea pig.\n\nSilas is not at the yard and not in the places where he likes to be seen being not, and when Owen does catch him he is on the river path doing nothing with his arms, which for Silas is a performance. They walk side by side as if it had been arranged and avoid looking like they are avoiding the looking. Owen mentions the gutter men and Rook sucks his teeth because he hates amateurs who think a disguise is a fluorescent jacket. He says there is a cousin-cousin with a van who does legitimate roof work and an illegitimate tendency to let his friends borrow credibility in exchange for forever owing him sausages. He says he will ask without making it look like a policeman asked through him and he will report back whether there is any love in that lineage. He says the thing about watches is not time, it is that they are small and gold-looking and a certain kind of boy thinks that makes them coins with faces. He says he will return to Ken to be told to slow down his jaw and he will consider chewing each mouthful for a county-approved number of times and he will probably lie and reduce it by three.\n\nThe pawnshop rings just before five and the man with the glasses that do not get excited twice says the beard has returned and is now calling itself Gary because Dave is a name that gets used up quickly in these types. He says the watch is now in a different pocket and the beard has learned to say his girlfriend gave it to him, which is a sentence that is supposed to plug moral holes and somehow never once has. They go and the beard is the sort of beard that has become a shelter for a face that wants to be older, and the man attached to it has the twitchy kindness of a person who will apologise even when he has been robbed. He says he found the watch under a bench in Goodlands Park while throwing a ball for a dog with one ear and he says this too quickly for belief to be an option. He introduces the dog\u2019s name as if that helps and the dog is called Nigel, which is either a lie so grand it deserves applause or proof there is a God of small comic touches.\n\nThey take the watch and the man because evidence must be accompanied by a narrative, and the back of the watch says To M, time keeps us honest and the date is a summer from before whoever you are was born. Laura comes to the station because someone should be the person who says oh and then yes and then something untranslatable, and she holds the watch like it is both a crime scene and a photograph. The relief on her face is difficult even to be near because it disguises two other feelings as itself, fear and guilt, and Owen watches her swallow and wants the moment to pass only because it would be indecent to stand there and make a snack of it. She says she will keep it and he says keep it until we say differently and she nods with that dazed compliance good people have when the systems that take days from them also sometimes return a thing.\n\nThere is a list in the office now with a heading written in a hand Maeve uses when she has decided she will not be ashamed of her own neatness: DOOR MEN. Beneath are notes that could belong to a school play if they didn\u2019t matter. Van possibly white. Plate possibly two 8s. Jackets that glow like a hazard conceived by an accountant. No logo or logo you can peel off. Patience limited by weather. They add to it as the hours present new fragments; Mr. Kettle texted to say Elsie had a caller who offered to check batteries in smoke alarms, which is a new script that needs rehearsing. Ken sent an email with three bullet points though Owen does not approve of bullet points in principle: trust your doubt, ask for ID, ring a number you already know. Griggs passes the room, reads the list, and makes a face like he has bitten a grape that presented as sweet and turned herbal. He says good and then ruins it by asking if the watch is going to come with an alibi and then adds that he expects the press to want to commemorate the retrieved sentiment out of all proportion to its utility.\n\nThat night Owen goes to Katie\u2019s because he is carrying the residue of everybody\u2019s afternoon and some rooms are good at taking residue and turning it back into air. She has an evening class for small hands, which comes with a kind of noise he tires of and misses in the same breath, and she moves through the room with an attention that is the exact width of each person\u2019s day. Ro is there because Min cannot say no to a boy with a new word in his pocket and the word today is structure, which he likes because it is both a thing you can touch and a thing you can pretend to understand. They make flowers that have little paper insects tucked between petals because this is how happiness hides, and Ro tells him he has written a story where a bee hides in a rose because the bee is frightened of being famous, and Owen says remind me never to be your bee because I would not survive the attention, and Ro says it is fine, the bee gets to go to Minehead and have a look at the edge.\n\nThey talk about nothing and everything, the way you do when doing with your hands frees your mouth from proving it is clever. Katie tells him about a customer who asked for a sympathy bouquet that wasn\u2019t funereal because she wanted the room to feel like an apology rather than a wake, and she tells him about glue brands as if brands are football teams, and she tells him about having burned her finger again because some people\u2019s competence is professional and their humanity is clumsy and both are required in a room. He tells her about the watch and about Goodlands Park and Nigel the one-eared liar and she laughs with the sort of laughter that is relief performing a waltz. He doesn\u2019t tell her about the bruise because he does not want to give her wrists a story they will then carry for two days.\n\nOn the way home he passes the bus station again because it has become almost a route he trusts even when the town bends. Aiden is not there because a good day for Aiden would mean he is where he said he would be, and Owen lets himself believe in good days because his job only costs him entirely when he forgets they exist. Outside the Castle Hotel a couple argue quietly in the careful tones of polite society who have mislaid their poise, and a man in a long coat that is not a choice stands in the doorway and smokes in a way that says he would quite like to be a better version of himself and is waiting to be given permission. A gull does the noise that will not be improved upon by any God and a small group of teenagers decide to pretend they are not cold as the evening throws down its mildness like a damp towel.\n\nHe sleeps in a way that would not pass assessment and wakes too early, which is a habit he has broken and resumed more times than he has visited the optician. He walks to his window and the river is available but refuses to be about him still, which is what he pays it for, and the lights hold the bridge like jewellery and the jogger who passes is one of those men who runs like he is smiling and Owen forgives him for it. In the kitchen he peels the sticker off a new pack of tissue paper with ceremonial slowness because nobody is going to give him a ribbon to cut and yet rituals help, and he folds until the part of his mind that writes sentences about risk and harm is tired enough to sleep again. He makes two leaves that are finally cousins and not strangers and he places them next to the peony that has become the week\u2019s lit candle.\n\nThe next day begins with a van stop because sometimes coincidence will reward you if you kick it in the shins. Pond calls from Roman Road with a voice that belongs in a slightly older policeman and says we have a van that is either white or it would be if it was not acquainted with rural life and a plate that has more eights than is strictly beautiful. They go and the van is what vans are\u2014a mess of paperwork that is never what you want and sandwich remains\u2014and the two men inside are versions of a man that a town like this produces when it wants doorways to have to work harder. They do the polite work and then the unapologetic work and there are clipboards that do not have logos and leaflets that say things illiterate printers have made uglier. The men are wearing the expression of people who consider their job to be a kind of service and the universe to be their consenting customer.\n\nThe worry is that this is not dramatic enough to be a plot and dramatic enough to bruise a week. They take details that will be misremembered and bettered in the retelling and they tell the men to stop doing the thing they are doing and the men say what thing is that and they say the thing with old women who would like to die without being talked at by people with fake safety vests. They issue the piece of paper that carries what little it can carry and they watch the men become the kind of angry that is mostly relieved at being told by someone in a proper coat to stop rehearsing being a wolf. When they return to the station there is the peculiar satisfaction of having made a small dent in a hallway of dents, and there is the familiar irritation of having to write it down without being able to say we did a thing that counts, we might have stopped a bruise.\n\nBy the end of the week, Marion\u2019s watch has a chain of custody that would satisfy a pedant and a small parade of people have put their head round the station door to say a sentence that begins with at least, as if they have been deputised by hope to do post. The bruise remains noncommittal and the peony remains evidence of nothing but a world where kindness and glue share a shelf. Griggs gives them a noise that, for him, is encouraged and tells them to keep their eyes on Rook because Rook is a weather map printed in someone else\u2019s ink. Maeve tells Owen to sleep and then tells him she knows he cannot because his eyes have that polished look, and she leaves a packet of crisps on his desk with a note that says for when the vending machine disrespects you.\n\nOn Saturday he goes to the class because he has promised his hands that if they do weekday duty they will be let off the leash for ninety minutes in a room where nothing has to be solved. The table is full of people who have discovered that folding is a form of prayer that allows blasphemy, and Katie has put a small jug of jonquils by the biscuits because she is not afraid to mix paper with real, as if to say they are friends. Greg is there and tells him about caulking with a seriousness that suggests caulking saved his life once, and Min listens to Ro explain photosynthesis to his own flower and nods like a scientist. They work and do the sort of talking that makes rooms safe; there is gossip about a hen night that required diplomatic intervention and there is a kindness left anonymously for someone whose dog is about to do the brave thing and there is one brief moment where a woman looks at nothing as if something has just left her, and Katie is in front of her with a cup before the group has even noticed.\n\nAt clean-up, whilst the tissue is being told off for being everywhere, Katie finds a scrap in the corner under the table that has been trodden into something resembling a message. It is a torn bit of a leaflet with only two letters and an arrow on it, and it can belong to any advert because arrows and letters are the lingua franca of people who put paper in public places. Still, Owen pockets it like a man who collects bits of luck in case the day needs topping up. He walks home in the kind of rain that does not consider itself rain and he thinks about watches and paper and the cost of breath. He catches his reflection in a charity shop window next to a row of orphaned dinner suits, and he pauses because the man in the glass looks like someone who has found a new corner in his own room. It is not joy. It is not sadness. It is the soft thing that sits between when you let it.\n\nSunday brings football on the County Ground and language in the street that believes itself only audible to the weather, and it brings a message from Mr. Kettle that he has decided to write K with his left hand forever because it slows him down and perhaps that is good medicine. It brings also a photograph from Ken of a whiteboard with the word boundary written and then circled and then circled again, and Owen laughs out loud and scares a pigeon into a sincerity it did not intend. He texts Maeve to say the boys with clipboards have been sat on and she asks if the dent left by their sitting is permanent, and he says nothing is, and she says that doesn\u2019t make a case to my taste and then sends a picture of a pub roast with the caption officer down.\n\nOn Monday a call comes from Greenway Avenue, not from the house with the affronted chair but from next door where the lilac fleece lives. The woman in the fleece has a voice like a cardigan and she says there has been a man in the street with an argument and the argument was with either the world or a hedge, she could not tell which because both remained unresponsive. They go because arguments have a way of acquiring spectators and therefore plot, and find a man not young who is remonstrating with a bin as if it has betrayed his trust. He is wearing a tweed waistcoat that has seen rain and he smells like barley sugar and old tobacco and he is Kevin Kettle and he is, apparently, angry at the concept of waste collection schedules. He looks at Owen like a man who has been found mid-monologue and is mildly embarrassed. He says he has been experimenting with not swallowing all his feelings because Ken says you must sometimes give them little windows and he has decided to test the advice on a Thursday\u2019s bin because the bin cannot be hurt. He laughs and says that perhaps he will choose a tree next time because bins draw crowds and he is too old to be beheld.\n\nOwen stands with him and says he is proud of him for sparing the bin any more eloquence and Mr. Kettle says in a small voice that his hands shook on Friday and he does not know why and he would like to know why but not the sort of why that has a price tag. He says he has been alive a long time and does not want to reach the end and think that all his feelings were receipts he never read. Owen realizes, standing in that tidy street, that the watch has returned to its wrist, the peony has returned to a room as a thing and not a symbol, and the town is back to its fidgeting and its tiny tenderness and its always-almost disasters. He realizes also that the case is not closed because cases never are, they are only moved to a shelf where they can look at other cases and nod politely.\n\nHe goes back to the station and puts a note in the file that says the watch was found and the bruise remains undecided and the gutter men are being discouraged with legal paper and volume, and he writes a line to remind himself later that what mattered was not whether a peony is evidence but that it was a thing people held onto when the room was a bit too much. On his desk, the paper flower looks less ridiculous than it did and more like a standard he has chosen to carry. He writes a message to Katie to say that if she needs wire he knows a yard where the man selling it will pretend not to be generous and the boy measuring it will be learning the names of trees from the ends of splinters. She replies with a picture of a ribbon misbehaving on purpose and he feels the peculiar satisfaction of being included in someone else\u2019s inventory of small victories.\n\nSilas appears at four without fanfare because even he has days when he does not need an entrance, and he leans on the corner of the desk until Griggs gives him a look that would peel paint. He says the cousin-cousin with the van has been told to stop lending credibility to people with clipboards because credibility is the only currency he has left that isn\u2019t counterfeit. He says he has found something at the river, and he produces from his pocket an object wrapped in a piece of his own shirt because theatre might be silly and also why waste an opportunity. It is a watch strap, not a watch, the leather chewed by water into something that would consider being a fish. He says it was snagged on a hook near the low bridge and it could belong to anybody and he thought of Owen because he is merciless to himself and mercy for others is something he is trying under adult supervision.\n\nOwen takes the strap and he thinks of the park and Nigel and the way objects get lost in a town like this by moving not far and by people who know the wrongness of their own hands and want not to. He logs it and labels it and gives it a number that will not flinch and thanks Silas in a tone that is not a truce but is not not a truce. Silas smiles like an abandoned pier being flattered by the tide and says he will bring biscuit donations to Ken because Ken\u2019s biscuits are ambitious but not quite generous enough, and he leaves with that small satisfying spin that means he would like the last image of him to be of a man who can be claimed for goodness at least once a week.\n\nAt shift\u2019s end, Owen goes to the river and leans because leaning is a vice he can defend in court. The peony is at home and he misses it in the pocket of his coat like a talisman he keeps telling himself is just paper. He watches a swan do that thing swans do where they pretend to be ballet and actually they are knives with feathers, and he listens to the town clear its throat for evening. Somewhere, in a room with shut curtains, a woman is writing down the names of the people who came when she asked for help and the names of the people who came when she didn\u2019t, and she is deciding she prefers the second list. Somewhere, in the salvage yard, Aiden is learning to distinguish oak from ash by its weight as if the world were a person you could know by how they sit on your lap. Somewhere, in a back room that smells of tissue and tea, Katie is counting ribbon by hand and letting herself cheat on three because she is human and so are we.\n\nHe goes home and opens his window with the caution he has for objects that have decided to be in his care, and he sits at his table and makes a peony that is less showy than the first and more like something that would last in a room which has had to learn the trick of lasting. He thinks not in conclusions because they don\u2019t trust him, but in the good half-thoughts that later become a way of being. He thinks that sometimes a bruise is a comma and not a full stop. He thinks that sometimes a watch goes on a small tour of the town and returns in time for the sentence to make sense. He thinks that sometimes paper is a truth because it remembers the hands that made it, and he thinks that if he is going to continue to be the sort of man who knocks on doors and collects other people\u2019s nights in trays, then he had better also continue to be the sort of man who sits quietly and folds, and lets the room be a room and not a report. He thinks this and then lets the thought be boring on purpose, because boredom is rest dressed as something else, and he puts down the scissors and eats toast and answers Maeve\u2019s text with a photograph of the flower on the table and the words: chief superintendent of tissue reporting a small, unimportant success, over.",

The tents go up along Fore Street like bright little arguments, the tarpaulins shivering at the idea of rain, the air already scented with onions learning to be burgers and coffee that has ambitions it may or may not fulfil. Owen stands by the station window with his coat half on and watches the traders lay out the objects that will, for a handful of hours, be the town\u2019s priorities. There is a stall of wools in improbable sherbets, another of tools that look like they were born to outlive men, and a table covered in old crockery that someone will call vintage because it is nicer to lie if the lie is pretty. He thinks that somewhere in this street there will be a watch that once belonged to someone else, and he tells his head that we are done with watches, we have done what we can for watches, and then his hands put themselves in his pockets because they do not trust him not to go looking anyway.\n\nMaeve arrives with a pastry she insists is medicinal and a face that is pretending to disapprove of weekends. She drops into the chair opposite with the neat collapse of a gymnast who only displays it when nobody is asking for it and pushes the pastry at him as if it has offended her. \u201cGriggs is vibrating,\u201d she says. \u201cTrading Standards want a hand with the door-to-door men, and he says words like joint operation as if he is asking us to marry a bureaucracy. Also, I promised my nephew I\u2019d get him a knock-off football shirt that will disintegrate the second it sees a washing machine, and I don\u2019t want to die in prison for complicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll make you go to court for wearing trainers,\u201d Owen says, taking a bite of the pastry and trying not to grimace at the sugar deciding to be his entire mouth. \u201cWhat\u2019s our pitch to the clipboard men.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, we too have clipboards,\u201d she says, and taps her temple with a pencil. \u201cWe\u2019re to be visible without frightening the elderly into not making tea. Smile, but only with the top half of your face, and try to look like a leaflet. And then,\u201d she adds, leaning in because if a thing is said leaning in it becomes something else, \u201cKatie\u2019s doing a stall outside Paper & Thread for the workshop\u2014Mother\u2019s Day prequel\u2014and I said we could hover. Community reassurance. Also, she said she\u2019s got new wire and I want to see what new wire looks like when you\u2019ve been burgled for old wire.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew wire looks like a promise,\u201d Owen says, and Maeve, who spots his soft sentences and saves them for blackmail, raises an eyebrow and lets it pass without harvesting. She has patience for the little enthusiasms he has chosen; she has a list of them in her head and she keeps it to herself like a child\u2019s pocket collection of good stones.\n\nGriggs does indeed vibrate. He does it by changing the colour of the word urgent in his voice and then pretending he didn\u2019t. He stands in the briefing room next to a blown-up photograph of a fluorescent jacket with no logo, and he points at it like a man introducing a relative he would rather not have to acknowledge. \u201cWe share this town with opportunists,\u201d he says, and at opportunists his lip does a small and involuntary curl as if he has bitten lemon. \u201cIf they knock and talk, you knock and talk louder. I don\u2019t want to read on Facebook that a man in a hat with a pen defeated the Queen of Taunton with chat. Trading Standards, TS to their mates, will say their bit about cold calling zones. We will not roll our eyes where they can see us. We will, as ever, be professional.\u201d\n\nThe map of the town on the wall is beginning to look to Owen like a board game invented by someone who was very fond of rules and rather less fond of fun. He traces, without moving, the route from the salvage yard to the Meeting House to Paper & Thread to Greenway Avenue and back to the station, and it draws an untidy heart he will not name. He and Maeve go out into the market and let the noise of buying things that may not be required do the blanket thing to the background anxieties of the week, and for a small set of minutes he lets himself be the kind of stranger who drinks a paper cup of coffee and nods at a dog carrier full of knitted hats. He sees Mr. Kettle long before Mr. Kettle sees him because Mr. Kettle is at a stall offering old postcards of seaside towns, and he is giving an impromptu lecture on the ethics of hand-tinting to a teenager who is politely pretending to be interested and who will later buy one to prove to himself he is kind.\n\nPaper & Thread has come out to meet the day. The sandwich board promises paper peonies with the encouragement of a midwife, and Katie has a table under a small tent the colour of childhood dresses. The tissue is stacked like a sweetshop and the wire is coiled into neat little crowns, and there are three finished blooms for show that look impossible enough to begin conversations. Katie is in a jumper that is the blue of tins on good shelves and her hair has formed a compromise with itself that manages to look intentional. She sees Owen and then registers the badge and smooths her face into the I-know-where-we-are smile that small business owners develop to survive both the public and officialdom, and then she remembers herself and does her other smile, which is a thing she gives her chosen people.\n\n\u201cYou look like PC Plod\u2019s handsome cousin,\u201d she says, lightly, and he blushes because he is not used to handsome being used anywhere near his vicinity unless it is in a joke about antique furniture. \u201cStaying?\u201d\n\n\u201cHovering,\u201d he says. \u201cOfficial hovering. Supportive presence slash threat to pickpockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can work with that,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll sell peonies and you sell the idea of moral improvement.\u201d\n\nMr. Kettle ambles over with the quickness of a man who has seen three diversions and chosen the fourth. He has a tweed waistcoat on because of course he does, and his beard is a tidy compromise with his age. He brings with him the smell of barley sugar out of habit, and he produces from his pocket without fanfare three wrapped sweets as if he is paying a toll. \u201cOfficer Tissue,\u201d he says to Owen with a tiny bow, and to Katie he offers his hands for ribbon duty like a man approaching Communion. \u201cI am to make something inadequate for a lady whose grandchildren have bought her an iPad,\u201d he says. \u201cI refuse to be bested by a rectangle. Give me wire, give me paper, give me a fight I can win.\u201d\n\nKen Wright appears in the way of a man who has the timings of other people\u2019s towns in his diary. He wears a jacket that has forgiven him for being Ken and a smile that is not the whole of his face, and he stands just outside the tent as if waiting to be asked for his opinion. He does his public-spirited thing where he buys a flower and then makes sure no one is watching when he produces a loyalty card for coffee, and for two minutes he is only a man making a morning look like a choice he has elected to make well. He tells Owen very quietly that he has given a talk to the WI about the dangers of believing men with laminated ID, and he says it with the tone of a man who expects a trophy and will happily accept a biscuit in its stead.\n\nThe butcher is where he always is at this time, arms folded, mouth set into a grin rueful enough to be used as seasoning. He calls across the road, \u201cSarge, are those real,\u201d and Owen shouts back without using a shout that, no, they are made of the tears of social workers, and Katie chokes on a laugh so sudden she turns it into a cough. There is weather in the air like a rumour, and the gulls are being articulate about a chip two streets away, and the town is busy making the argument for itself without needing anyone to moderate.\n\nThe first thing goes wrong and it does not look like a thing going wrong because it is polite. A woman whose bag has a strap like a belt and a face like someone who has been kind for a long time reaches for her purse to pay for a bloom and finds that the purse is behaving like magic. It is not there, and it is not anywhere, and the moment makes a very small silence around her, a circle of suddenly uncooperative air. She says, lightly, that she is an idiot and then more quietly that she had it at the cake stall and then she describes the purse to Owen as if it is an old friend who has run off with a stranger. He and Maeve do the little triangle dance of police in a crowd, the one that says we are here and not here, and they exchange a look that says we are back to theft when we wanted to be at craft.\n\nRo is along the edge of the stall with Min, his fingers investigating a length of wire as if it has a song. He is doing that pre-adolescent thing where his attention could feed a city and you can watch the moment when it narrows into sense. \u201cHat man,\u201d he says, not looking up, and points with his chin. \u201cSame as pawnshop? Beard like he\u2019s hiding a biscuit. Brown hat that doesn\u2019t like his head. He is practicing being not noticed.\u201d\n\nThe beard that called itself Dave and then Gary is browsing the mugs two stalls down, and browsing is too generous because his eyes do not rest anywhere long enough to describe having enjoyed resting. He has a brown felt hat that makes him look worse, which is an achievement, and his jacket is the colour of compromise. His hands are the wrong kind of careful. When his eyes pass over Owen you can see the instinct to be pleasant, to be charming, to be the sort of person men shake hands with in pubs, and you can see the calculation that says that this particular target has read that book and returns it with annotations.\n\nOwen doesn\u2019t give chase because there is nothing to chase yet and because he has learned the economies of movement available to him. He lets the crowd take him and he slides sideways into the wake of the man whose aliases have all begun to resemble each other. He hears behind him the smooth, unrelated conversations of a town on a Saturday morning\u2014someone wanting peas without the peas, someone else making hard weather of a simple technical matter\u2014and he lets the sound be there while his eyes do their job. The man with the hat does the thing where he looks in a shop window without seeing anything behind the glass and then makes a decision that looks like indecision. He turns toward the multi-storey like a man who has considered walking to the moon and settled for the level just below the roof of Sainsbury\u2019s.\n\nUp in the car park the air has a different temperature, a sort of concrete weariness, and the man\u2019s hat looks suddenly like theatre in a foyer where no one is yet seated. He slows, which is either fatigue or performance, and then he bends to tie an already tied shoe, which is the move thieves learned in the year nineteen whenever and have been loyal to ever since. Owen lets the distance be what it needs to be to make his voice arrive as if it has walked, and he says the man\u2019s name as if it is a shared secret from another time. \u201cGary,\u201d he says, and when the head comes up too quickly he says, \u201cOr was it Dave. It changes for me as well. Do we need to pick a new one for you in front of a desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cFound it,\u201d the man says, as if they have just discovered a spoon under a sofa cushion and the whole of a complicated social exchange can be reset to kindly domestic irritation. He puts a hand in his inside pocket and produces a purse with the casual guilt of a child who knows the adult already knows. It is the right purse, of course it is, the little silver clip like a smile, and he holds it out as if he is donating it to a raffle. \u201cI was going to hand it in,\u201d he says, and then laughs at himself because the lie arrives late and tired and makes no difference to what happens next.\n\nThey do the talk on the stairwell because it is private enough and public enough and because the whole point is to make the man understand he is being treated as a person even as he is being treated as a man who will be, in about eleven minutes, asked to sit somewhere he does not want to sit. Owen uses the tone he saves for people who are not strangers to the idea that they are better than their day and he asks the questions that are less about catching and more about making a map. The watch is not on him, which would have been too neat, but there are two wallets, both of which are returned to their owners within half an hour in an exchange that feels like putting back a word in the right sentence. There is also wire in the boot of his car, which is the wrong kind of wire because it is new and clean and bought with intent. He says he was going to mend a trellis; he says his girlfriend likes roses; he says he has more than one girlfriend and all of them like roses; and he stops talking when he hears the footstep of a man arriving with paperwork in his pocket.\n\n\u201cWho are you working for today,\u201d Owen asks, because men like this always are, and the answer comes with the rolled eyes of someone who thinks the hierarchy he belongs to is a joke even as it keeps him fed. \u201cBlake,\u201d he says, and then because he has had to tell the truth somewhere in a week for it to go down and this is his moment, \u201cTwo-Eights. He calls himself that. For the plate. For luck. He thinks the number eight is his mother. He thinks the council owes him a road.\u201d\n\nTwo-Eights is the man in the white van with more eights than a reasonable plate ought to, and the satisfaction is small and present because it says the town is not reinventing its wolves every morning; it is borrowing them from the last night and changing the hats. Owen waits for the trade to show in the man\u2019s face, the one that says what he will give and what he will keep, and he lets the arrest be untheatrical because dignity is both policy and, if he is honest, a superstition. In the market below, life continues to sell itself, which is the most reassuring and least comforting fact he knows.\n\nBy the time he brings the purse back to the woman at the stall it has become a story she will tell with gratitude and a quiet embarrassment, and she tries to give him a five-pound note for his trouble as if this is a fairy tale, and he says please don\u2019t because he has never known what to do with that kind of tender. Katie does the competent person\u2019s magic lady act where she makes the only right words available to a person whose day has wrong in it. She tells the woman she has lovely hands and puts the flower aside as if it has a name and she will not sell it to anyone else, and she tucks a tag into the ribbon and for a second the market becomes a place where people are supervised by a kind god.\n\nSomething goes wrong again, in a different key. One of the finished flowers on the table disappears and is back and disappears and is back and then is not back, and it is small but it hurts because things have been taken from this small room under a tent enough times, and Katie stands straighter because uprightness is resistance, and then it turns out to be a little girl with a fringe like a lawn and eyes that are prepared to cry, and she has been in possession of the peony for three minutes without understanding that possession can be complicated, and her father returns it with a clumsy speech about honesty, and Owen watches the exact moment when shame gets introduced into someone\u2019s house and decides to be a door that opens rather than a wall that instructs. He gives the little girl a scrap of tissue and shows her a fold you can teach a person in thirty seconds that gives them ownership of their hand, and she looks at the crumpled thing as if it has given her back something she did not know she needed.\n\nMidday is all edges. Trading Standards arrive in hi-vis that actually means something, and the clipboard men sidle off to be elsewhere, and Mr. Kettle completes the ribbon-pinning with the solemnity of a man performing dentistry on a doll. Ken does a round of handshakes as if he is running for a very small office and slips Owen a card that says boundary on it in his own careful handwriting, and then immediately asks if it was too much and if so he will withdraw the word. Maeve, who has a capacity for being useful while appearing to be entirely ornamental, does ten conversations at once, two of which are with dogs, and concludes that the town is in a mood to be told not to be careless without being told it is careless. The butcher sells a man sausages with the air of a priest distributing absolution, and a teenager practices a trick with a fidget spinner as if he intends to make it his trade.\n\nSilas passes by with his gravity set to charming and makes a point of not seeing Owen until he has already been seen, and then he does a little bow like a man who has rehearsed grace. He buys a flower and takes a long time doing it and longs to be taken for a man who knows what to do with paper in the presence of a woman who knows what to do with paper, and he compliments the wire in a way that can be taken three ways. He has a boy at his shoulder who is not Aiden because the world is more generous in its malice than to repeat itself, and he gives the boy money he calls lunch rather than wages, and the boy looks like someone who has been paid for the first time and suspects the note will evaporate if he unfolds it in the wrong shop.\n\nWhen the cake stall begins toothless gossip about the arrest up in the car park the air shifts in that way where the town remembers what it is supposed to do for itself. People are suddenly grateful for each other in principle, even if they are quite cross with each other in the detail, and somebody buys a bouquet they do not need and then remembers someone who might and takes it to them and by the end of the hour Katie\u2019s box is half empty in the way boxes are ideally empty. Owen lets himself be pleased that his presence is part of the right theatre and not the wrong one, and he lets himself think, for three seconds, that perhaps it is possible to have a job that takes and a hobby that gives and let both swim in the same sea without making a killing.\n\nOf course the day would not be the day without a small, good thing being spoiled. Halfway through a demonstration of the crease-friend trick something grabs the back of Owen\u2019s arm through his coat and when he turns it is not danger but an urgency that looks like danger to someone who has not had to practice the difference. Laura Vale stands there with a face that has either cried or is about to and she is holding the watch at an angle that suggests she is afraid of damaging the time. \u201cIt\u2019s not hers,\u201d she says, and the sentence is an admission ticket into another hour. \u201cThe engraving\u2014the date is right but the wear is wrong. I woke last night and I just knew. I took Mum\u2019s jewellery box out of the drawer and I looked at pictures and I knew. I\u2019m sorry. It is not hers.\u201d\n\nHe takes the watch because he has to and because he wants to save her hands from the job they have taken on, and he registers the small quake in her voice that comes when a person has to unravel a relief they have prematurely laid on themselves. It is not the first time something has come back wrong in the shape of right and it will not be the last, and it is not anyone\u2019s fault in particular and yet it will insist on making itself someone\u2019s for the purposes of the person who wants to sleep tonight. He tells her they will take it back without letting go of the fact that the last week needed this to be neat and it is not going to be, and she presses her lips together as if to stop the word at least coming out and then says it anyway and then asks how you return a thing to the wrong sort of belonging.\n\nAfternoon draws its own little borders. Trading Standards pack away their pop-up gravitas and leave leaflets about not letting men in no matter how persuasive their fluorescent vests, and the market gives up on itself in patches and then all at once as the stalls disassemble into the luckless shapes they are when not on duty. A child has lost a shoe and is laughing about it as if this is a win, and a man has bought a painting of a dog because the artist was disappointed in a way that required rescue, and a gull is making its case to be included in the general amnesty for nuisances. Katie counts the cash into the jar with the concentration of a person honouring the pact between honest work and honest reward, and between notes she checks her phone because a woman who runs a shop is in a permanent relationship with a device that lets the world tell her what it wants from her.\n\nThey take statements in the back room with the kettle doing its journey from hum to sing like a friend pretending a talent. The purse lady thanks them three times, each time for a different thing\u2014the manner, the speed, the absence of contempt\u2014and Owen files this away as if it will feed him when he has a day that does not. They give Gary/Dave to custody with the amicable sternness of teachers finally sending a boy to the head, and he goes with that mixture of relief and outrage that is the standard uniform of the temporarily caught. There will be a court and a story and there will be the attempt to make out of his day an aberration rather than a summary, and Owen will do his lines and not enjoy them and then he will go to the river and make himself into a person who can fold paper without the paper thinking he is occupying the room too loudly.\n\nIn the quiet after the quiet, between taking their coats off and deciding they have taken them off for the last time today, he and Maeve find themselves in the evidence store in front of a box that has not been kind enough to resolve into a utility. The door-to-door operation has a smell, and it is stress and cheap deodorant and sometimes private fear leaked into public space, and it clings. Maeve, who has a capacity for cruelty when it is kind, says, \u201cYou look like the market let you be a person,\u201d and he says, \u201cIt did,\u201d and then he adds, \u201cLaura\u2019s watch is not her watch,\u201d and they both stand in the do-not-touch of what that requires. \u201cWe will find out who Nigel\u2019s Nigel is,\u201d she says. \u201cWe will talk to Two-Eights again and I will count that as a weekend activity.\u201d She is writing a joke and a promise into the same sentence and the fact it works is the reason he will follow her into rooms until one of them forgets that you can come back out of them.\n\nKen\u2019s email lands with his set of polite bullet points and a photograph of the whiteboard with boundary written and then improved by someone at the meeting to include the word porous in small letters underneath, and Owen laughs because the word makes him think of bread. He writes back thank you in a tone that is careful not to be either snide or wooed, and he closes his eyes in his chair for the kind of rest that could be legitimately described as blinking. When he opens them again there is a strip of late light on the floor in front of his boots like tape for an actor, and the station is full of the sounds of people convincing themselves they are nearing the end of something.\n\nHe goes to Paper & Thread because the day will sulk if he doesn\u2019t. The shop has taken back its afternoon and looks as if it has inhaled, and Katie is elbow-deep in ribbon and triumph and minor grief and she has that look of someone who has been good all day and will now, if permitted, be silly. They stand on the floor among the shelves and talk about wire as if it is a moral choice and he holds the wrong watch in his palm and says too much and she edits it into the amount she can bear to own. She tells him she will teach him to do a centre that won\u2019t sulk and he realises he has been waiting his whole week to be told to do something in that exact tone. She gives him three sheets of tissue in a colour that does not exist on glorified screens and a piece of ribbon that will not behave, and she says, \u201cTake this home and make it misbehave correctly,\u201d and he finds himself wanting to pass that instruction on to his job.\n\nThe text from Aiden arrives at the bus stop, a message that is both proud and tentative because boys are trained to be cautious with proud. Got paid, it says, and a picture of a fiver with a thumb in it, and then, as if covering his own joy with a blanket, still got to tell my mum I didn\u2019t spend it. Owen writes back good boys tell their mums and brave boys do it badly and still do it, and Aiden replies with an emoji that he will later disavow because softness is a liability and a superpower and he is not yet able to hold those two facts in the same pocket.\n\nThat night, because not sleeping is a skill he has and he refuses to treat it as one, he puts the wrong watch on the table next to the flowers and he watches the hands agree to disagree with the hour. He takes the tissue and he makes a centre that does not sulk, not all at once and not beautifully, but he makes it, and he sits in the small room that making opens up and he stays there the length of a song he does not like, and then a silence he does. He thinks of Silas pretending not to improve, of Ken pretending to be a man you cannot dislike, of Mr. Kettle actually being one, of Laura refusing the easy comfort to make room for the truth, of Maeve putting crisps on his desk like a sacrament, of Katie making the town friendlier than it would have been without her, and he thinks that if you collect enough small domestic braveries they make a defence you can stand behind without having to memorise a speech.\n\nIn the morning the inevitable happens, not dramatically, not with sirens, but with an email and a sigh and then a phone call because everything has to have three forms now. The rugby club reports a loss of wire delivered to a back door that had been asking the universe to prove itself unkind, and the loss is discovered because a man who does balloons has a conscience about tickets. The shoe prints match the brand that smells like lunchtime fights and birthday money, and there is a picture from a cheerful yellow camera mounted above a back lane that shows a hood that reveals nothing and a gait that reveals a little too much. Owen puts it with the rest and resists the urge to draw a cartoon wolf on the map with a speech bubble saying \u201cI did not bring a logo,\u201d and instead he writes up the thing the way it wants to be written.\n\nThey go to see Two-Eights because this is the game and because there is a pleasure to be had in a conversation you know you will win by not needing anything immediate from it. He has a van that has undergone three different eras of care and none recently, and he has a face that looks as if he would practise being honest if there was an app. He denies everything and graciously allows that some things might have happened adjacent to him without his knowledge, and he says that wire is wire and a boy is a boy and who can be expected to understand the tides of either. Maeve does that thing she does where she speaks as if she has just woken from a restorative nap and tells him that the town has decided to learn his number, and he smiles the non-smile of a man who thinks the town can be made amnesiac on demand and will enjoy being wrong.\n\nOn his way back, Owen crosses the bridge and looks down at the river in its usual state of mind. A man is throwing a stick for a dog that is not named Nigel and the stick is not in competition with the river for the dog\u2019s attention because the river is winning the game the dog is not playing, and the man laughs like a person who needed to hear his own noise. The town is already one foot into Monday, regulations and injustices and washing machines arguing back, and he lets the crowd fold him without thinking better of it. He has a centre that does not sulk in his pocket and it is ridiculous and helpful and he decides to be both about it. He thinks about stopping by the Quaker Meeting House to read the board that says there is something of God in everyone without wanting to fight the sentence, and then he thinks he will not, he will go to the shop that sells brass screws and ask unnecessary questions about countersinking because talking in that shop is a form of meditation for older men and he is trying on the idea.\n\nBy the time he reaches the station he has the shape of a small plan for his hands for tonight and the shape of a much less satisfying plan for his day, and he is greeted by the whiteboard which now features, under the green heading DOOR MEN, a new line in someone else\u2019s hand that says FLOWERS?, which is both a joke and a decision waiting to be made. Griggs passes and reads it and pretends he doesn\u2019t understand what the question is because if he acknowledges that nice things can be involved in ugly work he will have to stop storing his shirts in the freezer. \u201cYardley,\u201d he says, \u201cif you bring me good news I will pretend I deserve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have news,\u201d Owen says, and he holds out a watch that isn\u2019t, and he holds back a centre that is, and he watches his boss be a man who requires a format. The day exists and he will go through it and he will find, later, that the part of it that stays is a ribbon he made behave, and he will be both annoyed and grateful, and he will tell no one and tell everyone by becoming someone\u2019s quiet, manageable friend. He will text Maeve a photograph of a bowl of apples and ask if she wants to be sad about something on purpose, and she will answer with an emoji of a bin, and he will know that they are, despite the universe being what it is, going to make it to unimportant successes at least twice before Friday.",

The station had the particular Tuesday smell of wet coats resigning themselves to radiators, and the whiteboard, which had acquired a life that occasionally bit, now featured FLOWERS? written in a more hopeful green than the person who wrote it would admit to owning. Griggs stood beneath the question like a man at a museum confronted by an installation he suspects is insulting him. He did a small sigh that could have been wind or could have been a comment on human nature and said, \u201cIf flower deliveries are now reconnaissance, I will require this town to find a new hobby.\u201d\n\nThey were supposed to be writing the boring bits\u2014doorstep warnings turned into numbers for the Home Office to argue over\u2014but Marion Vale\u2019s name was still sitting in the long corridor between case and file, and it made Owen\u2019s pen drag when he wrote it. Laura had called early to say the funeral director had dates, as if dates were logical in an illogical week, and he had done the thing he does where he is helpful without committing his insides to the conversation. He had almost said, when she said they were thinking of flowers, that paper was an option. He had almost told her about a room above a shop where you could sit and make something that admitted it wasn\u2019t going to last and decided to be beautiful anyway. He had not said it, because there are times when mixing your rooms is a species of theft.\n\nMr. Kettle solved the morning\u2019s purpose by phoning to say Elsie\u2019s door had been flirted with. His description: two men, both with the posture of men who have practised looking taller, one with new trainers that squeaked their own guilt, the other with a confidence that had to have been imported. They had leaflets that claimed the authority of lamination and a forged sense of neatness, and when he\u2019d told them he would be calling their office to check, both had the flinch of men who do not enjoy being called offices. \u201cAnd then,\u201d he said, with the pleased dignity of a man who has crafted his own anecdote, \u201cthey posted a note through Elsie\u2019s letterbox to say sorry they\u2019d missed her and signed it, Love K. I have never been so furious at a letter of the alphabet.\u201d\n\nOwen held the note in a plastic sleeve twenty minutes later and tried not to recognise the shape of a joke he hated. The paper was cheap, the kind that thinks it is already a memory, the K done with a hand trying for friendliness and landing in sales. There was a tiny smear where the pen had been lifted too slow. It was not Katie\u2019s left-handed wonk; it was someone who had watched kindness and attempted an impression. The ribbon that had been attached with a bit of tape had a very particular rib, and he saw Katie\u2019s shelves as if they were a field map\u2014the cheap satin, the expensive silk, the middle child she bought because people like options. This ribbon was the middle child, cream with a faint wire edge. The men had the sense to buy good material in small parcels. It made his throat feel thick with something he did not, strictly, have words for in this capacity. You cannot call ribbon evidence with the same face you use for blood.\n\nElsie, perched in her dressing gown like a small queen who had accidentally invited the village into her chamber, told the story of the knock as if it had been both a fright and a fable in the same minute. Her front room smelled of last night\u2019s toast and old lavender. She showed them how Mr. Kettle had stood, exactly there, angled so he could see both men and still block them with a politeness they could not argue with without becoming too obvious. \u201cThey said the word vulnerable twice in the first minute,\u201d she said, affronted. \u201cPeople who use the word vulnerable at my gate often require me to teach them the meaning of the word no.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re collecting the rubbish they post,\u201d Maeve said, with the smile she uses for women who have decided their house is sovereign territory. \u201cIs the ribbon familiar?\u201d\n\nElsie peered and sniffed it, because some women consider their noses to be an instrument of authority. \u201cThat is from the nice girl\u2019s shop,\u201d she said, as if identifying a cousin in a line-up. \u201cThe paper flowers. I bought one and it lasted five books. It did not make me think about watering. It made me think about being alive.\u201d Then, because she had to reclaim some power from the morning, she added, \u201cAnd I am not very cross. I am a bit cross. I am mostly tired of men with vans.\u201d\n\nOn the way back, the rain remembered it had other towns and took itself off to annoy someone else. The air felt emptied out and newly available. They cut by the Meeting House because Ken had arranged himself into their week and because his flyers were suddenly part of the way certain men learned certain corners of the town. He was in the foyer with a woman who had the edges of grief pressed in so far it looked like neatness. He saw them and held up a finger in apology, then finished whatever word he was giving her\u2014the kind of advice that can be moved from person to person without losing too much heat. When the woman had gone, he accepted the plastic sleeve like a man accepting a test. He looked at Love K and his mouth did the precise thing between insult and understanding.\n\n\u201cThese bastards,\u201d he said, very softly, in the way of a man who has once in his life deliberately chosen a swear word and is now very good at it. \u201cThey did this two years ago with my old logo. I wrote the words Talk to someone who cares on a leaflet and they stole the words and the font and used them to sell double glazing to widows. I changed everything. I got a lawyer who is six foot four in case that helps, and it didn\u2019t.\u201d He put the sleeve down with care, as if it might bruise. \u201cYou know this already, but I\u2019ll say it anyway. Kindness is a currency and currencies get counterfeited. Take the ribbons, take the phrases, the colours, the bit of your day that assumes something soft is safe. They use the tone as a crowbar. It is why I do the rules now, even though they make me feel like a headmaster: trust your doubt, don\u2019t make decisions at the door, ring a number you already know.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they come to your sessions,\u201d Maeve asked. \u201cThe men who counterfeit kindness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey come once,\u201d Ken said, and smiled a little with his mouth and not his eyes. \u201cThey come to see whether the room can be turned into a shop. They don\u2019t come back because the tea is free.\u201d\n\nThey found themselves at Paper & Thread without saying they would go there, which was becoming a habit and therefore a risk. The bell did its small, self-conscious bird and Katie looked up with a what-now expression that softened when she saw it was them. She listened to the description of the note with her hands in ribbon, the way people stand better when holding something. She didn\u2019t swear because she saved her swearing for glue and injustice, but her eyebrows did a curse. She fetched the middle-child ribbon and measured the rib between finger and thumb as if verifying a rumour. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey bought four little rolls on Saturday\u2014the day of the market. A man in a hat that had an argument with his head and a boy who took off and put back on his hood four times because he was rehearsing. They were charmers in the way that is born of a mother who is tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cHat,\u201d Owen said. \u201cBrown, felt. Beard like he\u2019s keeping a snack safe under it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one,\u201d she said. \u201cHe bought and did not flirt, which should be a relief and made me angrier.\u201d She reached under the counter and did a magician\u2019s flourish with the cheerful yellow camera. \u201cI listened to you and bought this. It likes to tell me it is uploading to a cloud, which sounds like a death. Do you want to look at my clouds.\u201d\n\nThe pictures gave them the hat in a cloudy margin and the shape of a boy who could be six boys and the currency of cash. They had a time: eleven-forty-one. On the back of the receipt book Katie had written in pencil, because she writes her day down in little ways, ribbon x 4, wire medium x 2, cash, hat. She had also drawn a rectangle and shaded it because sometimes hands need a shape to sit in after they have dealt with a man who believed his politeness protected him.\n\nBack at the station, the ribbon sat on the table like a polite animal that might bite. Griggs did his brief hover\u2014he has at least three\u2014and looked at the sleeve long enough to convey his displeasure at the universe\u2019s insistence on being ironic. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, which meant be careful. \u201cIf I see Love G anywhere in this town I will retire. I will fold.\u201d He left, carrying his weather with him. Maeve took her neat pen and added to the whiteboard under FLOWERS?: door decoy, ribbon from P&T, hat + hood, eleven forty-one, and then, because she can never resist making lists into something you can breathe inside, she wrote KINDNESS COUNTERFEIT in small letters above and then drew a line through it, not to cross it out but to hang things from it. Owen loved her for and despite that. He took a photograph of the board for his pocket and told himself he would delete it later because it looked like a poem and he didn\u2019t trust poems in his phone.\n\nAt lunch he and Maeve were assigned to support Trading Standards on a street in Galmington that had decided to be watchful. TS were out in their tidy vests that meant something, talking about cold-calling zones like people introducing a diet to a room of pastries. Owen had refined his walk for these things: neither prowling nor strolling, an official amble. Two-Eights\u2019 van was nowhere near because he was not stupid, but a cousin-cousin white transit with a winking indicator did a slow sweep and then kept on, which was as good as a wave. They spoke to three people on doorsteps who had had a knock and one who had had to close the door on an entire conversation he would once have felt obliged to finish. They met a woman who held her phone as if it were a weapon and took photographs of high-vis men without their permission \u201cfor the neighbourhood group,\u201d which is a way of saying for her heart. A man in a fleece asked what the point of a no-cold-calling zone was when the cold was everywhere, and Owen, who is paid to answer those, said sometimes signs are like saints, sufficient to make a certain type of person rethink sin. The man in the fleece bought that and put it in his pocket for later.\n\nThe salvage yard presented itself to the afternoon like a thought you\u2019d been trying to hold down. Owen went because either you go to the thing you are thinking about or it grows teeth while you attend to paperwork. Silas was in the back doing a practical man\u2019s ballet with a length of copper that wanted to be unmanageable. Aiden was sweeping with a focus that suggested sweeping was either a meditation or a penance, and given his age perhaps both. When he saw Owen he straightened in the way boys straighten for approval even when they have decided they will not need it this week. Silas did not look up immediately, which meant he was practicing not giving Owen his entrance.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making your place very dishonest-looking,\u201d Owen said, because the best way to turn a weather into a conversation is to punch it lightly in the arm. \u201cDid your life coach tell you to rearrange the sign that says \u2018we are legitimate\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told Ken I collect rude sentences for my private entertainment,\u201d Rook said, finally taking a hand off the copper. \u201cHe said I might consider whether the entertainment was a symptom of loneliness. I told him to invoice my loneliness and we would see if it pays. He wrote it on his board, which made the loneliness feel seen and therefore smug.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got men using paper flowers to test houses,\u201d Owen said. \u201cLeaving notes that say Love K as if they have our sense of humour. They bought ribbon from Katie. Tell your boys if anyone uses the word Love in a font at a door I will personally teach them that affection can include court.\u201d\n\nSilas\u2019s face did a flicker of something that had to work to get through. \u201cI\u2019ve seen one of those notes,\u201d he said, as if confessing to finding poetry in a skip. \u201cLeft under a mat up by the old people\u2019s bungalows. The boys you\u2019re describing are hungry, and not for poetry. I told Two-Eights if I see his men pretending to be post, I will feed his van to a magnet. He laughed and sent me a message of a magnet with a sad face. It\u2019s exhausting being charming when charm has gone out of fashion.\u201d He thought for a beat, eyes going to the place in the yard where decades of municipal railings whispered to each other. \u201cAlso, for what it\u2019s worth, one of that lot commissioned a frame,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not build it. I declined because the breath on the words smelled wrong. Asked about a trellis large enough to carry three men behind it. Asked about wheels he could bolt on and off. He thought he was being clever by not saying why. I thought I would consider breathing instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrame,\u201d Owen said. \u201cFor what.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor parties, he said,\u201d Silas replied, and the word parties came from his mouth like a joke that had not learned its own punchline. \u201cFor wedding backdrops. For the bit where the bride can pretend to be a vine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWire from Paper & Thread went missing the same hour,\u201d Owen said. \u201cRugby club ordered the week before. We have a hood in a cheerful yellow camera\u2019s idea of a lane. If you see a rolling wall of flowers and men behind it, perhaps throw a chair through it.\u201d\n\nRook hitched a shoulder. \u201cWe live in a town that can be talked into thinking it is smaller than it is,\u201d he said. \u201cA wall that rolls is a piece of theatre. Street theatre is a way to be a thief with applause. Tell your TS people to watch the back doors when the pretty thing goes by. And tell Ken that if he writes boundary again I will tattoo it on my forehead so he has to find a new word.\u201d\n\nHe walked away before Owen could decide whether to forgive him for being useful. Aiden followed, then hesitated and came back with the awkward bravery of boys who have decided to do a kindness and wish the world would not make a fuss. He held out a bag from Paper & Thread. Inside was wire, medium, two. He said, \u201cHe sent me to pay Katie back,\u201d and looked defiant and then immediately embarrassed that he had used the wrong face. \u201cNot for the bad men. For something else he didn\u2019t do. For buying time he didn\u2019t spend. I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s rubbish at explanations.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d Owen said. \u201cHe is recently rehearsing not being rubbish. It is very tiring to watch.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon had the left-behind feeling the town sometimes gets when the children are at school and the day is clearing its throat for later. The rugby club sent over CCTV that did, beyond reasonable doubt, show a piece of moving scenery being wheeled past their back door\u2014a trellis, improvised from builders\u2019 mesh and the sort of pipe you buy when you are too nostalgic to commit to scaffolding. The flowers on it weren\u2019t real but they weren\u2019t embarrassing. Owen thought of the word glamour\u2014glamour as a spell that changes the way a thing looks, glamour as the magic that makes you look and not see\u2014and he said it out loud and Maeve nodded because she had been looking for that word all week. They watched the hood and the hat and a third man whose job seemed to be to frown in front of the wheels and make passersby feel impolite for interrupting a performance. Nobody could be expected to call the police on a backdrop.\n\n\u201cHow did we arrive at villains with props,\u201d Griggs said when shown, like a man confronted by an avant-garde production of a play he once liked in a village hall. \u201cI am not funded for props.\u201d Then, because even he can enjoy competence when it is happening in front of him, he put a finger on the hat in the printout and said, \u201cGet him. If you can, get the grillman too.\u201d\n\nThey did not get him that day because life is not a montage and because rolling walls are moves you make twice at most. They instead did the long small work\u2014calls to clubs and halls and function rooms, to anyone who rented tables and joy by the hour, to ask if a frame had been ordered and if it had arrived with men who could charm a room into looking the other way. Trading Standards, cheeks flushed because being useful flips the blood to a new setting, began talking to neighbourhood groups about hospitality as tactic. Maeve did a radio spot, her voice trying not to sound like a school assembly, and told the town that love notes do not come through doors at tea time.\n\nIn the middle of that civics, a text arrived from Katie that said: a man is here buying ten peonies all in cream, says he can\u2019t write with his hand because he broke it, could I tag each one Love K for him please, and I said no and he said I was unhelpful and I smiled like a saint. Also, he smells of a new van and old trouble.\n\nOwen and Maeve did not run\u2014there are times when you do not run to a shop because you do not want to bring your job\u2019s heartbeat to a room where glue should be the loudest thing. They arrived briskly enough for the bell to do a flustered version of itself. Hat man was at the counter, hand in a sling that had not been tied by anyone trained in tying, speaking in a tone that had misused charm so long it had become sarcasm. He turned and saw their coats, and he did the brief, ridiculous calculation of whether he could hide ten cream peonies about his person, and then he did a smile that said he had decided to pretend he enjoyed being arrested.\n\n\u201cGary,\u201d Owen said, and that time the name landed like a stone. He took in the sling with the glance of a man counting exits and did not buy it, because the sling sat too high and had the wrong kind of knot, and because men like this rarely changed sides mid-week and broke themselves honestly. The shop\u2019s ceiling seemed to lower itself as if to listen. He told hat man that he was wanted for a conversation because of a purse, because of a watch-shaped argument, because of a van and its numbers, because of a rolling trellis with a dishonest sense of theatre. The man tried to produce indignation like a trick and dropped it. Katie watched over the counter with the kind of attention that could flay or bless and decided on the second.\n\nOn the way out, before the door bell could perform, Ro and Min came in with the wind, Ro holding a bundle of wire like a champion holds a bouquet. He stopped dead at the sight of the sling and the hat and the constellations of adult faces that still hadn\u2019t unclenched. He said, too loud, because children in rooms with cowboys either whisper or shout, \u201cIs this the man who steals watches,\u201d and the man said \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d and in that don't everything he did rearranged itself into the very shape of a yes.\n\nCustody smelled like it always does, a mix of long day and recent mop. The paperwork was speeded by the fact that the hat man\u2019s name had been collected three ways and would satisfy a judge. There was a moment, there is always a moment, when you see the thing inside the person you were concentrating on catching. He cradled his fake sling arm with a real tenderness that had not yet been used up by the morning, and he asked if he could keep the ribbon, and Owen, puzzled and irritated and human, put the small coil back into his pocket, because even men who counterfeit kindness sometimes need a bit of white silk to worry between their fingers while the afternoon tells them about themselves.\n\nThat evening the town allowed itself a little sunshine like a treat it had been promised on condition of good behaviour. Owen stood with his coat unbuttoned on the pavement outside Paper & Thread while Katie locked up, the key juddering because the world had taught it to fear being necessary. The butcher across the road was chalking prices and pretending to hate it. Ken passed and did his two-finger salute like a man in a film who had joined the army very late. Mr. Kettle emerged from a side street with two jonquils in a jar as if he had conjured them, and complimented the lock for surviving, and told Owen that Elsie had decided to write a fierce letter to the council and he had supplied adjectives by the bucket. They spoke, for three minutes, about nothing and everything, which is the only way to get through a Wednesday if you enforce laws in a town you also insist on liking.\n\nInside, the shop smelled like paper had decided to be a plant. Katie put the open till tray on the counter and counted with the seriousness of a person weighing something that wasn\u2019t money. \u201cThey will be cross that you got hat man in my shop,\u201d she said, and he braced for anger that did not come. \u201cI am cross that they have learned the shape of a love note. I am cross that they are using my ribbon to teach fear to women who will die one day and do not need any more practice. I am possibly also cross that you made me like you and then brought your job into my room. It will pass. It has to.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and did not say the careful thing he had prepared. He said instead, because his head had turned words over all afternoon until one unaddled itself, \u201cI keep thinking about counterfeit. It would hurt less if it didn\u2019t look so much like the thing. Real kindness leaves fingerprints that don\u2019t show until later. Counterfeit kindness leaves a residue that is sticky on day one. We should teach that. That\u2019s not very police.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can do both,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can teach law. I can teach ribbons. Ken can teach breathing and then I\u2019ll bully him in the doorway about it. Mr. Kettle can give old ladies barley sugar and make them tell him their adult children aren\u2019t telephoning enough. Rook can be wrong in public and right once a week for fun. You can catch the hat. I\u2019ll sell cream. We\u2019ll manage a town.\u201d\n\nThey stood there, the two of them, in a small shop that sometimes performed theatre and sometimes saved the day\u2019s balance with glue, and they agreed, without saying it, that the world would not be better if only it admitted the shape of criminal minds. It might be better if paper was allowed to be paper and hands were allowed to be hands.\n\nHe went home by the river because it would have been rude not to. The light had entered that late stage where it apologised to windows privately and made bridges into ideas. He made the centre that did not sulk because he had promised himself he would, and this one did not sulk in a way that felt like a tiny negotiated peace. He made a leaf that did not want to be in the same family as the other two and decided that sometimes families function regardless. He wrote down in his book not the arrests and the times and the names, though those went somewhere too, but a sentence he would not have owned last year: do not let the counterfeit teach you to distrust the real. He thought it might be a thing he could live in for a week.\n\nJust before sleep could trick him, his phone made the noise that meant someone who wasn\u2019t quite allowed was asking to be allowed anyway. It was Laura. She had been through her mother\u2019s drawers again, she said. She had found an old jeweller\u2019s box with the impression of a watch long gone on velvet. Beneath the velvet, in the space where a spare link had once lived, there was a scrap of paper folded so small it had thought it was dust. On it, in a script that had remembered how to be young, was written K\u2014Pls fetch hedgehog from Wendy\u2019s, x. It was nothing, she said, and also faced the right way. Owen, who had spent a day watching notes make rooms bigger and smaller, said, \u201cKeep it,\u201d and then added, because it was the thing he had, \u201cand bring it to the funeral so we can put it in the bowl with the apples.\u201d She did not ask him why apples, and he did not tell her about October, and the language they didn\u2019t have found them a room and let them sit down.",
