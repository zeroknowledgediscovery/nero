     "novel_text": "The first bus out of Tonbridge groaned past the river, the driver drumming his fingers on the wheel like he was keeping time with something only he could hear. The grey light threw up low shimmers from the Medway, and the swans looked like badly folded napkins dotted along the water. On Quarry Hill Road, the shop shutters shivered awake. One by one: a fishmonger with a fractured green sign, the charity shop that smelt of lavender and dust and bright wool, the carpet place with the display rolled up like the tongues of dragon dogs. On the corner, a half-dead tree scratched a page of sky. You could almost smell toast, if you wanted it enough.\n\nTom Merriweather walked to work with a key ring like a small planet orbiting his palm. He was thirty-eight and had a face people said was trustworthy when they'd lost something. He had shoulders that sloped like he'd grown used to carrying poles, planks, ladders, children who'd fallen, guilt about leaks. He worked at St. Pilgrim\u2019s Primary, a practical building that never decided if it wanted to be hopeful or petty, and after ten years he could listen to the walls and know which was about to peel.\n\nHe talked to the doors. \"Morning, you.\" The doors never answered, but responded in a way, the way a door does: swinging more easily for people who wag fair words at them.\n\nThe custodian's cupboard smelt of mop and medicinal soap and yesterday. He clicked the light, listened to the whirr of the fixture warming up\u2014half a second, then the blossom of humming. It sounded, in his better moods, like the beginning of a song. He sang to himself because it made the mops dance and the broom handles softened their hard stares. He had a voice that, to him, seemed to enter a room half a beat before he did.\n\nIt was an old song he favoured this morning, something his mum used to hum while shelling peas\u2014Molly Malone, poor girl, or the one about a river that was never the same river twice. He liked the way the vowels lifted like kites and then went slack on their strings. He liked imagining that they could fly to a place where he fit. He ran the mop along the assembly hall like a man sweeping a stage, paused to look at his own reflection in the polished wood and saw one of those faces that can't keep still. He hit a note at the ceiling and held it longer than the light held its breath.\n\n\"Again?\" Mrs Penney said from the doorway. She was somewhere between stern and soft, and wore shoes that knew where they wanted to go.\n\nTom straightened, the mop head dangling. \"Keeps the acoustics exercised.\" He tried a joke like he always did.\n\nShe smiled with only two thirds of her mouth. \"The sound system keeps the acoustics exercised. You've the caretaker's cupboard today. Leaking bleach. And the Year 2 play equipment hasn't come, so be a magician.\"\n\nHe pulled the mop upright like a soldier. \"Righto, righto. You want me to build a donkey or a spaceship?\"\n\n\"Both. It\u2019s Goldilocks in space this year. Budget cuts. And\u2014\" She hesitated, turned, decided against whatever she was about to say, then decided for it. \"Keep the singing for after three, will you? They're doing tests. And you know some of them complain.\"\n\n\"Who complains?\"\n\n\"Parents. Mostly. The children like you. Or they like the idea of you.\" She left on that odd note, and Tom felt an old bruise of embarrassment bloom at his collar.\n\n\"You can't shush a river,\" he murmured. He did not sing again, which was not the same thing as stopping.\n\nHe liked the little jobs that nobody noticed. There was a satisfaction in the quiet heroism of a hinge that no longer squeaked. He took the box of screws from the toolbox, lifting handfuls like pistachios, cupping each tiny head between finger and thumb and turning, turning, until it bit and held. He was good at turning until things held. He was less good at knowing when to stop.\n\nAt break, a group of boys gathered by the back step and watched him wind the hose onto its reel. The newest one, a small boy with a forehead like a cliff, asked, \"Sir, why do your eyes sing when your mouth does?\" Which was nonsense strictly speaking, but true in a way Tom liked more.\n\n\"You hear with more than your ears,\" Tom said. \"Watches can hear time pass you know.\"\n\n\"That's just ticking,\" said a sensible boy with a tight mouth.\n\n\"Ticking is sighing for machines.\" Tom winked and the small cliff nodded as if he'd deciphered something.\n\nThey asked him to sing. He shook his head toward the staffroom window, where a silhouette moved dangerously like a teacher with opinions, and he sang anyway, but quietly. \"When I was one-and-twenty...\" The boys leaned in, mown-grass smell, scabby knees, a chorus of the bored and the fervent. Halfway through, the sensible boy giggled and then they all did, a ripple moving through them like a fish. Tom smiled and finished the verse. After they ran away, he looked up to see his own reflection in the staffroom window, mouth open, eyes partly closed. It wasn't pretty. He decided it looked serious.\n\nHis phone vibrated like an insect in his pocket at lunch. He ate in the little cafe beyond the station some days, but more often he went to The Oast House, which had learned his name without asking. Kira, who worked the noon shift and wore eyeliner as if it were armour, poured him a pint of lemonade without asking, and placed it in front of him like a truce.\n\n\"You singing tonight, Tom?\" she asked. She was used to the question stealing the lift from her eyebrows when she saw the way he lit.\n\n\"Not formally,\" he said. \"But I will if conjured. I'm thinking of\u2014\"\n\n\"Please don't say My Way.\"\n\n\"\u2014My Way.\" He grinned at her as if he had done something clever.\n\n\"You know the contest?\" Kira nodded at a poster pinned near the back door, where it would attract exactly as much attention as a notice about a missing cat. SOUTH EAST SONG QUEST, it read, a star and musical notes climbing a ladder. Heat from the kitchen had curled one corner. The paper looked as though it was tired of making promises.\n\nTom's eyes landed like magpies. \"Is that\u2014\" He got up too quickly and his lemonade sloshed.\n\n\"That's old,\" Kira said over the clink of plates. \"Came last year, I think. The bloke never collected the posters. They do a new one every spring. You can go to Tunbridge Wells and stand in a queue and two minutes later they'll tell you what you've got. Or not. It was funny last time. There was a man did Blackbird who sounded like one.\"\n\n\"Blackbird's easy to confuse,\" Tom said gravely, closer to the paper than any grown man should need to be. The print had been smudged so the dates smudged with it. A tear-off strip had only one ragged number left: 0777something, the rest lost to time or teenagers.\n\n\"There's more online,\" Kira said. \"It's always online.\"\n\n\"I don't have the online.\" He said it lightly, in case it was a confession.\n\n\"You don't have the online?\" She laughed the way she did, an unexpected delighted sound like dice in a cup. \"You don't have a phone?\"\n\n\"I have a phone. It's a phone that phones. It's... a talking machine.\"\n\n\"Eyes to floor, Granddads,\" she teased. \"Well, maybe you get a leaflet from the library. Or ask Gary. Gary has everything. He's a mole with Wi-Fi.\"\n\n\"I'll ask Gary,\" he said, pocketing the poster tab, though it lacked the piece a person would need. He liked the feel of torn paper. He liked talismans.\n\nHe ate his shepherd's pie in a daze, counted out the coins, and left a chip in neat halves, because leaving a whole would be wasteful, and eating it would be greed. Outside, the afternoon air had taken on that peculiar crispness that happens when a coastal wind gets lost inland. He used the back lane, because it was quicker and because it had a mural that changed every few months, messages painted over messages, an archaeology of spray paint. Today it said YOU ARE GOLD in letters that slumped at the edges. He imagined the mural talking to him when he couldn't sleep. He tried not to imagine the mural telling him something truer: you are brass, you are tin, you are not the thing you think.\n\nWhen he finished the day, he took the long way home for no reason other than that he wanted to pass the old cinema. He liked the names on the marquee even when they were for films he would never watch. He liked that wishes could be lit, letter by letter, even if they spelt out nothing you\u2019d recognise later. He lived in a bedsit above Finnerty Carpets, with a stovetop that made a sound like a throat clearing when it was ready, and a window that didn't face anywhere useful.\n\nHis upstairs neighbour was Mr Dray, who coughed through the floorboards and played the shipping forecast for comfort, low but relentless. If Tom put his ear to the skirting he could hear the shape of it, the hush and swell of weather where he had never been. Sometimes he hummed along. It didn't fit, and that was the point.\n\nThe walls were thin enough that you could borrow things from your neighbour without asking, like heat or the scent of burned jam. Tonight he borrowed a sliver of cricket commentary and the smell from Finnerty's of new carpet: plastic and glue and hope that this would be the one that didn't stain. He boiled spaghetti until it surrendered. He wrote his name on a post-it note, because it amused him to imagine a policeman holding it up to his face in a future where he had forgotten. He placed the note on the fridge and looked at it for a while, noticing how the letters hunched like people in a bus shelter.\n\nHe tried the number on the poster tab even though it wasn't complete, because he believed in mercy. He dialed 0777 and then the ghost of digits, his thumb hovering over blankness as if he could fill it with wanting. The tone told him to stop being foolish. He laughed at himself and didn't feel silly at all, which is a little worrying if you look at it too hard.\n\nHe went downstairs, locking the carpet shop on the way with the key Finnerty had given him for emergencies. Finnerty said he had a face like someone who wouldn't steal, which was both an insult and an honour. The evening had a bruise in it now. He walked along the High Street and turned into the coin laundrette with its neon that made everyone look a little dead. Gary ran the place, sort of. He sat behind the counter with a flat cap and a flat expression and eyes like a caravan site: all of it temporary.\n\n\"You look like someone who needs to know the internet,\" Gary said by way of greeting. \"Or a stiff drink. I can only help with one legally.\"\n\n\"Do you know South East Song Quest?\" Tom asked, and it pleased him that the name made a pattern in his mouth. ACK. ST. Q. You could sing those letters.\n\n\"I know everything that has a forum,\" Gary said. \"And I've had the misfortune of reading one about that. Why?\"\n\n\"I want to enter,\" Tom said, which felt like pushing open a door and finding a meadow or a cliff, and then finding out it was a mirror.\n\nGary typed with two fingers and a solemnity that made the task seem holy. The screen lit his face from below and stole his age. He made noises at the screen, low key exasperations. \"All right. There's heats all over Kent. You go and you do your party piece and then people get angry in the comments. Final's at the Assembly Hall in Tunbridge Wells like always. They moved one to Maidstone once and no one stopped going on about it. There's an email address. There's a phone number, but you don't ring it because you'll get a person who needs to be rebooted.\"\n\n\"I'd like to skip the queue,\" Tom said, as if saying it might make it true. \"I'm not really a queuer. I\u2019m a late-comer-and-then-anointed sort.\"\n\nGary snorted. \"You'll want the wildcard. They do a 'community hero' thing. The kind of person who helps old people with their bags and rescues dogs and then everyone claps regardless of whether he can hold a tune.\"\n\nTom looked appropriately saintly. \"I rescue chairs. Does that count?\"\n\n\"Depends on the chair.\" Gary handed him a pad and a pencil. \"Write down your full name, your real one not the one you give girls at the pub, and your mobile and your email and I'll pretend to be you for five minutes and send them your sob story.\"\n\n\"I haven't a sob story,\" Tom said quickly. There was too much of one to choose from. It wouldn't sort itself in a paragraph. And it wasn't quite sob, besides. It was something with a different weather system.\n\n\"Fine. We'll call you The Singing Caretaker and make up the rest. People love a title. Like The Laughing Plumber and The Psychic Fishmonger. We will say... you repair things. And sing.\"\n\n\"I do repair things,\" Tom said.\n\nGary wrote. He typed. He clicked. He sucked his teeth like a mechanic negotiating a stubborn part. \"Done. They'll either ignore me, or they'll be in a bind and they'll pounce on you because a caretaker is human enough to project decency onto. You'll get your moment. Could be fun. Or a catastrophe, which is also fun.\"\n\n\"Did you ever sing?\" Tom asked, because he couldn't imagine Gary being younger than granite.\n\n\"I was in a ska band for six weeks,\" Gary said, straight-faced. \"We were called skA+ which seemed clever at the time. It's not a talent thing. Crowd decides if you're allowed or not. Most of the time you learn your people are mean. Still want to do it?\"\n\n\"More than the other things,\" Tom said, which was true.\n\nHe went to bed astonished that he'd done something. The bedsit had that brittle quiet of single-occupancy places, soft objects arranged to look like they weren't assigned to one pair of hands. He lay on his back and thought about lights. The kind that make a tunnel out of the world and put you inside it. He had been under those lights once\u2014well, twice. The first time was Year Six Play, a scandal of paper crowns and cellophane stars. He was an angel then, a sacred mistake in wings made of net curtaining, and the light made him feel as if somebody had finally seen the shape of him. The second time was when his mum went. The hospital lights made everything look like a coin you found in a gutter. He stored both experiences in the same cupboard of his brain that he couldn't bear to open or to forget.\n\nHe woke before his alarm, because his body didn't trust clocks. He shaved with a razor that had lost interest. He sang to the mirror and believed he improved marginally around the lower notes. He ate toast and put jam on it with discipline. On the way out, he ran his hand along the banister, which, despite appearances, had one loose nail that gave a secret thrill like a hinge with a plan. He told Mr Dray's door, \"Good luck today\" because he believed in inter-apartment relations like that. He was answered with a cough that could have been agreement or despair.\n\nBack at St. Pilgrim's, he found the noticeboard disorganised in a way that made you want to blow at it and watch the papers reorder themselves like flocking birds. He took the pins out of one corner at a time, sighed each sheet into place, tacked them back with care. It made the day gentler, knowing something in the world had been sorted. He fixed a radiator that had decided to impersonate a glacier. He re-grouted a bit of the Year 3 boys' loos with a patience that would shame saints. He fetched a box of cardboard shapes and elastic bands from the storage cupboard and turned it into a twentieth-century spaceship with a donkey's head. The children saw it at lunchtime and yelped as if he had conjured a dog.\n\nHe was wiping glue from his hands with the ease of habit when his phone made that uncertain sound it made when it received a message. It was the sound of a small thing dropping into a bigger thing. Unknown number. He opened it as one opens a fortune cookie, with equal parts hope and amusement. Please call re: South East Song Quest. It had numbers in the message, complete and not smudged at all.\n\nHe felt a hot thing move up his spine. A tingle at the base of the skull that people talk about like it's magic. He stepped into the cleaner's cupboard because he wanted walls around him when he rang. The smell of bleach and almond made his eyes water. He dialed and he waited and the line picked up with a recorded voice that told him he was important and then a real voice that sounded like someone with a smile that had been stapled to her face.\n\n\"Hello, South East Song Quest. You've reached Marianne.\"\n\n\"Hello, Marianne. I am... I'm Tom. I sent you an email. I mean a friend did. I'm the caretaker. He is. We are the caretaker. Are. Am.\"\n\n\"Lovely,\" Marianne said, proof that you can say nothing and still sound like you're in charge. \"Yes, so, we've looked at your application. We don't normally\u2014well, this is unusual\u2014\" She laughed, a professional laugh. \"We have a wildcard final slot for a community champion this year. One of our finalists had to pull out. If you could attend the final, next month, we would love to have you. We've had a look at your profile, and it's really touching. 'You fix the world while humming.'\"\n\n\"Gary,\" Tom said softly, because there was such a thing as a friend who could choose better words than you could when you needed them.\n\n\"Sorry?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said brightly to cover it. \"Yes. Yes. The final.\"\n\n\"We'll sort your song choice nearer the time. You can't do My Way, I'm afraid. Or Hallelujah. Legal reasons mostly. And we might do a small film about you in your day-to-day if that's all right. Nothing intrusive.\"\n\n\"I can do not-My-Way,\" Tom said, feeling delightful. He thought of the boys by the steps. Perhaps they'd be proud.\n\n\"We'll send you a pack. There will be forms. It's not glamorous. But the stage is.\"\n\n\"I know.\" The words came out like a prayer you'd say in a church you'd wandered into because of weather.\n\nMarianne rattled off details: dates he would forget immediately, times he wrote on his palm with a Bic that read only on the third attempt, what to wear and what not to, where to stand and what not to say to sponsors. He said yes too many times. He hung up and put his head against the door and laughed, a small neat laugh that could turn mean if you took away the air.\n\nHe went back to the hall dazed, to find Mrs Penney adjusting a microphone stand. \"You look like someone who has swallowed a helium balloon,\" she said.\n\n\"I have... news.\" He wasn't good at saying big things like they were small things. He was either too loud or too careful.\n\nMrs Penney put her hands into her pockets, the signal of a woman who is about to weigh. \"Is it news I want to know, or a morale hazard?\"\n\n\"I've been invited to the final of a singing contest. The last\u2014well, the last bit. In Tunbridge Wells. I'll be on... a stage.\"\n\n\"You'll be on a stage,\" she repeated, her tone revealing nothing. Then she gave him a little smile, the kind she kept for children who'd made something recognisable out of glue. \"Well then. We'll put up a notice for you in the staffroom. 'Big Tom. Small Stage.' No. 'Stage Tom, Thin Ice.'\"\n\n\"Don't be horrid,\" he said, and then a pity came over her face like a veil and she reached out and patted the back of his hand, once, quick, as if that made a difference to the shape of any of it. She didn't say the thing she could have said, which was either kind or lazy.\n\nWord got around because words fly better than birds. The Year 5 girls wore expressions of sarcasm that had been pinned to their faces by older sisters. A TA called Sandra told him she was \"dead proud if it's on the level.\" Gary sent a text with three thumbs up and a skull, which counted as serious endorsement. Kira wrote on a napkin, which she handed him ceremonially when he came in for his lemonade: You're going to smash it! She drew a microphone that looked like a lollipop. He folded the napkin and put it in his wallet like a prayer card.\n\nHe phoned his sister because he didn't want to. Nina lived in Gravesend and could not imagine living anywhere smaller than London or bigger than a lap. She was what people call capable like it's a compliment and an accusation both.\n\n\"You what,\" she said after he had told her. It wasn't a question so much as a scalpel.\n\n\"They have a thing for a community champion,\" he explained, loving how noble that sounded. \"For someone who works with\u2014\"\n\n\"You mop floors, Tom,\" she said. \"I mean. Yes. It's good. It's honest. But don't let them do a thing on you like you're Mother Teresa with a squeegee. People like to laugh. At you, which you know, or at the story. Promise me you don't sign anything without\u2014\"\n\n\"They're not out to hurt me,\" he said, hearing the child's turn in his voice. \"It's a nice thing. I'm being... included. I haven't been... included. Not like this.\"\n\nShe was quiet long enough for him to know she was choosing between being the sister who cares and the sister who wins. \"Okay,\" she said eventually. \"I will come. If you want me. Or I won't, if that makes it easier. Either way, I'm here, which is ridiculous because I am there, but I'm here.\"\n\n\"Come,\" he said, suddenly, wanting her in a seat if only to have someone to look up at who would remind him he didn't come from nowhere. \"Wear something that doesn't rustle.\"\n\n\"You're absurd,\" she said, and he felt like someone had draped a blanket over a chair and called it a tent.\n\nThe days changed their shape. The school stayed itself, stubborn, a river that would not be told what to do by a man with a bucket. But around it, everything in him sharpened. He began to rehearse without permission. He sang in the hall when empty, and in the cleaner's cupboard with the light off, and in the echoing cavity of the gym store where netballs nested. He found a song in his throat that he didn't know he had: something old, almost liturgical, that had a place for a trembling voice. He hummed in the corridor and the children hummed back, unaware of what they were doing: being accomplices.\n\nAt the pub, Kira tried to give him a shot of something that tasted like burnt oranges. He sipped and winced and said it was good with an honesty that made her laugh. In the laundrette, Gary made him watch videos of people being ruined by the internet, then videos of people being made by it. They all had the same light in their eyes, which either meant the light had to be there or the light came on when it was pointed at you. He studied their mouths. He practised standing with one foot slightly in front of the other, like a person in a magazine. He bought a shirt that didn't belong to him yet from a shop where young men rolled the sleeves the way people on telly do.\n\nHe didn't sleep well. The bedsit magnified the smallest sounds, as small rooms do, so that every mote became a mote with a face. He sat up and drank water and thought of his mother humming. She had had a voice like a kettle just before it whistles. You could hear the promise in it, the potential for something louder. He thought about his dad, who had had a voice like a door closing. He tried to remember the last time someone had clapped for him. He couldn't, so he made a time up. He decided it had happened when he fixed the lift that one winter, and Mrs Penney clapped, because she did sometimes, with a single crisp sound that meant well done and please stop.\n\nWhat surprised him was the way people came to him with their stories. A boy from Year 6 told him about his mum's midnight shifts because of the electricity. A teacher told him about a man she had wanted to be with and wasn't. The postman told him about singing in a bar in Malaga every August, because his wife made him and then he didn't want to stop. He absorbed all of it. It lent weight to the idea that he was part of something. That he could be embellished with all their could-have-beens.\n\nOn a Friday, the school held its assembly for \"Music Through the Ages\" which was mostly an opportunity for Mrs Penney to play the piano and for the students to move their mouths in a way that could be called singing if the lights were low. Tom watched from the side like a stagehand. At the end, someone\u2014Sandra probably\u2014called him up. \"Mr Merriweather will sing us out.\" It wasn't ordered; it wasn't kindness exactly. It was like being pushed gently into a pool.\n\nHe went. The hall was indiscretely bright. The piano waited like furniture. He stood and he put one foot in front of the other like a magazine and he opened his mouth and the sound came. He thought it good. He thought it strong on certain vowels. He thought it wobbled on purpose. The children watched him with that odd attention children have for adults who are being the wrong sort of adult. He finished and there was clapping, thin and combined like the sound of rain on a tin roof. He caught Gary in the doorway because of course he had come and of course he was leaning, and Kira next to him with eyes like a cartoon. He tried not to cry, which would have made everything worse and better.\n\nHe received a packet in the post the following Tuesday, which made the day open like a mouth. It had his name on a label he kept and placed under a magnet shaped like a strawberry. Inside there were forms, as Marianne had said, asking about allergies and availability and whether he agreed to be filmed in the vicinity of his workplace and what charity he would dedicate his performance to. He chose the hospice because the hospice was the only place people had said his name with gentleness in their mouths that week in his whole life. He signed where required. He used his best pen, which meant it didn't work on the first try.\n\nThe film crew said they'd come on Friday afternoon, to catch him at his work and at his leisure. He spent twenty minutes wondering if he had leisure, decided he did not, decided it could be invented. He told Mrs Penney, who nodded stiffly and ordered the children to be feral somewhere else. He told Kira and she did something to her hair that made it look like an apology. He told Gary, who said he would be available to play himself as the \"sarcastic friend with heart of gold\" if the budget allowed. He cleaned the corridor twice that morning, because he wanted it to shine in a way that the camera would think was natural.\n\nThey arrived with equipment in cases that made him feel as if he had been cast as a destination. Two people: a cameraman who had tattoos peeking like secrets from under his sleeves, and a producer whose ponytail could have been a metronome. They had names, but they said them quickly, as if they were interchangeable. They had a list of shots that had been chosen to make him look competent and humble and, ideally, charming in an entirely non-threatening way. \"Can we get you opening a door?\" the producer asked as if this were a test.\n\n\"I can open a door,\" he said, with the gravity of someone who could.\n\nThey filmed him opening three doors, from different angles. They filmed him sweeping a corridor. They filmed him adjusting a chair. They asked him if he could sing while sweeping and he said yes and then he did, and it felt silly until it felt right, and then it felt silly again. Children wandered into frame and were gently moved by the corralling arms of the producer, who did this without touching anyone, like a magician. They asked him questions, and he answered in sentences that made sense until later when he thought perhaps they had not. \"Why do you want this?\" \"Because it's a wanted thing.\" \"What does music mean to you?\" \"It's a coat that fits.\" \"What will you do if you win?\" \"Probably cry. Then mop up.\"\n\nThey filmed him in his bedsit, which made him flinch. He had tidied but there is a way that a room reveals a person even when the person thinks they have closed curtains over their soul. The camera saw everything: the strawberry magnet, the folded napkin with a drawing of a microphone, the post-it with his name on it, the old teapot that had belonged to a woman who hummed. They asked him to sing there too. He did. It was strange how the room absorbed the noise, how the walls listened like friends trying not to smile.\n\nAfter they left, he sat in the quiet and felt like someone had taken a blueprint of him and folded it back into something else. He tried not to wonder how he would look on a screen. He tried not to imagine the sound of strangers clapping. He went to the window and put his palm flat against the cool glass, because sometimes a person needs to be stopped by something.\n\nHe ate beans on toast and forgot to put pepper on it, which his mother would have called a sin even if she hadn't believed in anything. He lay on the bed and stared at the crack in the ceiling he called Norway because of its shape. He tried to pray, but it looked like talking to himself and he laughed instead. The laugh sounded thin. A bus wheezed past. The floorboard above squeaked and was still. He logged into nothing and thought about all the songs he couldn't choose. He practised silence, because he'd been told once that the best singers knew it. He called Nina and hung up before it connected. He picked up the phone again and put it down again and then he slept because he'd exhausted his options.\n\nThe film ran on the local news on Wednesday. Gary recorded it in a way that involved an external hard drive and swearing. They gathered at The Oast House to watch it because it turns out there are rituals even for people who don't have rituals. The pub smelled of damp coats and chips and wet wood. Kira wiped down the bar with theatrical thoroughness. When the segment came on, everyone noticed at once, because the atmosphere changed; it became the sort of quiet that isn't quiet at all.\n\nThere he was, on the screen, a smaller him inside a bigger him. He watched himself roll a bin, beautiful in its ugliness. He watched himself open a door with the tenderness of a man touching a sleeping baby. He watched himself answer questions and he looked like a person who had been told a joke that he didn't get but decided to laugh at anyway. He heard his own voice and thought it strange that it sounded like that, both thinner and thicker than the one he knew. The children were in it too in a blur, faces left anonymous by the cunning of editing. The piece ended with him on the steps outside, the river behind him doing its best to look like it meant it, and him saying, \"We deserve lights sometimes, even if it's just a torch under a chin.\" The pub clapped because of course it did, and the sound made him want to sit on the floor.\n\nAfterwards, people came up and touched his arm like it was a talisman. A woman said he reminded her of her husband, who could do almost what he could but didn't. A man said he'd vote for him if voting was allowed. Someone bought him a pint of lemonade and then someone else upgraded it to a proper pint that he accepted because refusing made people feel embarrassed about their generosity. Nina texted a picture of her TV with his face on it and wrote: Honestly, you. Then: I'm proud, which he read three times because it didn't look like a word she would write unless she was choosing.\n\nHe walked home a local hero, which is to say people decided to see him. A teenager called him Legend which is the word all teenagers keep in their pockets for anyone who looks them in the eye without flinching or selling them something. He took it and tucked it somewhere he would find when he needed it. He climbed the stairs and put his key in the lock and listened to the tiny sound it made. The hinges greeted him like he had taught them to. The carpet smelt like new, which it never did. He sat on the bed and tried not to rehearse winning and losing. He rehearsed instead the moment when he would walk on to the stage and there would be that tunnel of light and he would be in it and he would not be afraid. He was tired beyond the place tiredness comes from. He lay down and the bedsit held him like a carton holds an egg, and he slept\u2014he slept like someone who has a job to do and wants to do it well, even if the job is waking up.\n\nThe next morning, everything went wrong in small polite ways. The kettle refused to boil to the required level of anger. His shirt decided to be crumpled in a pattern he had no iron for. The sky might rain, or not. On the way to school, a bus sprayed him with a courteous arc of clean water. \"Bless you,\" he said to the bus, because he could be generous.\n\nAt St. Pilgrim's, a pipe burst in the Year 1 cloakroom and wrote its name in damp along the baseboard. He shored it up with a bar towel and a clamp and a prayer and later with a plumber who came in with an attitude and revised it to something workable. Children skated on the wet floor because that is what they do when faced with a hazard. He swore under his breath in a language Nina would have recognised. He held the door for a teacher whose hands overflowed with art. He made a tea that looked right and did nothing and he drank it anyway.\n\nHis phone vibrated around midday. Another number. He answered because he had learned to answer now that there were more things that might be news.\n\n\"Tom? It's Marianne,\" she sang, her bright tone dented. \"Everything's fine. It's fine. Just\u2014there has been a tiny change. It's nothing. Don't worry.\"\n\n\"I will worry if you say don't,\" he said. \"That's how I am.\"\n\n\"It's about the dinner,\" she said. \"The pre-final dinner next week with the sponsors. It's quite small. Will you be all right? It's at Le Pingouin. There's a menu. We\u2014someone mentioned you might be vegetarian. Are you?\"\n\n\"Only by accident,\" he said, and he meant it. \"I'll be fine. I'll be brilliant. I'll wear my shirt.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she said. \"All right then. See you Friday for the rehearsal bit. You're doing so well.\" The last sentence sounded like something she says to children who had made numbers on a sheet happen in a certain order. He wanted to be offended and couldn't quite be.\n\nLe Pingouin was not a place he went to. He had walked past it and felt the chill that comes off posh places like a air-conditioning set to discomfort. He imagined now what he would look like inside it, with his new shirt and the eager way he would speak and the way his hands spoke for him. He practised saying \"medium rare\" and then corrected to \"well-done\" because he'd never quite learned to trust red. He imagined linen napkins, and everyone saying each other\u2019s names over and over.\n\nHe told Gary, who said, \"Don't let them put anything into your drink that glows in the dark. And don't let them make you sing into a cutlery holder. That's a trick.\"\n\nHe told Kira, who said, \"People like you or they don't, Tom. Fancy knives don't change that. Don't go in hungry. Wear your heart in your chest, not your sleeve. And for the love of the gods of Kent, don't take a selfie with a prawn.\"\n\nHe promised all the things a man promises when he wants to be trustworthy and has few tools beyond the sincerity of his face. He could feel the days narrowing, a funnel to a point that glinted. He could feel that there would be a moment when he would think a thought he wouldn't be able to change. He had had those before. He tried not to look for them.\n\nThat evening, a new poster appeared on the mural wall that said, THIS IS YOUR MOMENT in a font so enthusiastic it was almost rude. He thought of crossing out the word YOUR and writing OUR but he had no pen.\n\nHe went home with a bag of shopping that had aspirations. The little Tesco near the river had put the posh pasta on special and he felt fancy choosing the shells that looked like something you could put to your ear. He bought tomatoes and the basil that came in a pot so even the leaves sounded like they've got something to live for. He chose a kilogram of lemons because it seemed like a thing a person who could sing might do for reasons that would be revealed later. He put everything on the counter like offerings.\n\nMr Dray knocked after nine. He never knocked. He coughed through the open air instead, most days. He stood in the doorway with a face like someone who had looked for something all day and found he ought to have been looking somewhere else.\n\n\"You made the telly,\" he said, as if he were translating from a dialect. \"You sounded all right.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Tom said. He stepped aside. \"Do you\u2014do you want to come in?\"\n\nMr Dray looked at the threshold like it had rules. \"No. No. Just. Don't get silly. They make you silly. Sing into your pillow when you need to. Not for them. For you.\" He left without a goodbye, which counted as kindness in his language.\n\nTom closed the door and leaned his head against it because it was becoming a habit. He could feel the world on the other side of the wood. He could feel all the versions of himself he'd been gathering like paperweights. He whispered the names of songs to the crack in the ceiling. He decided which one would show him at his best, which is a different question to which one he loved.\n\nHe tried to picture the stage in Tunbridge Wells. He had been to the Assembly Hall once, university girls singing a cappella in dresses that knew what they wanted. He remembered the feel of the seats, a bit too polite. He remembered not knowing where to put his hands. He imagined now hearing his name through the speakers, a small local name carried proudly to the far corners of a very ordinary soundscape. He practised walking onto the stage. He practised not tripping. He practised saying \"Thank you\" without a bleat.\n\nHe slept finally with the window crack-open and the river smuggling in its breath. He dreamed of a corridor that went on so long it had to be a lie, and of a mop that was also a microphone, and of his mother standing in the wings with her hands wrapped in her jumper sleeves, watching him like everything was happening for the right reasons.\n\nMorning came. It does. He was tired. He put on his new shirt for no good reason other than to test it for fits. It fit. He made tea, and the tea was the right colour, which happens sometimes and you should not pretend it isn't a blessing. The day went as days do. He swept and fixed and opened and closed. He thought about the dinner and the stage and the light. He kept thinking of the corridor in his dream. Some doors staying shut, and some opening, and some painted to look like they would.\n\nHe found a feather in the cloakroom, grubby at the end, beautiful at the top. He picked it up and tucked it behind his ear and then took it out because he remembered he was seen. He put it in his pocket instead. He did not imagine himself a bird. He imagined himself a man with a feather in his pocket, which is different, and gentler.\n\nHe whistled. He forgot he was not supposed to. The corridor looked down at him fondly and with reproach. He accepted both. He moved along the day toward the promise of a small white tablecloth and the first bite of a dinner that would make him think he had been invited to the inside of something. He moved along the day toward an evening in which someone would pour him a glass of wine and, perhaps, a person would say, \"So, Tom, tell us about yourself,\" and he would say, \"I repair things,\" and that would be enough. He moved along the day toward the part of the story he had begun telling himself at night, in the places between waking and whatever that other thing is that isn't dying and isn't peace and isn't even rest, but stands in for them when there is no time left for thinking.\n\nIn the corridor by the Year 3 classroom, the sunlight made a rectangle on the floor that looked like a window you could step into. He stepped into it, because he had a second, and in that shaft of gold he raised his arms and he sang one note, long and ridiculous. The lights didn't shake. The walls didn't crack. A child walked by and laughed and then did a cartwheel, uninvited, perfect. He bowed to the child like she was an audience of many, and she bowed back, solemn as a tiny monarch, and then was gone, and the day went on.The week shuffled forward like a deck that refused to be cut clean. He could feel the dinner ahead of him the way you feel weather through a window: something pressing and interesting that didn't have to do with the room you were in until it did. He tried to pick a song the way a person tries to choose a suitcase for a long trip, not too heavy and not too flimsy, something that would arrive intact no matter how it was handled. He tried them on in the hall at St. Pilgrim\u2019s with his mouth for a mirror and the sprung floor judging him gently. Molly Malone made him think too much about his mother and not enough about the notes. A hymn nudged at him and he pushed it away because he didn't want to be mistaken for pious when all he was was faithful. Then in the cleaner's cupboard, where the light always came on with the lag of a thought, he found himself singing something that had been part of the furniture of his head so long he'd forgotten it had a name: The Water Is Wide, the kind of song that makes room for mistakes and means them. He sang it once and then he sang it again quieter and found that the second time the cupboards held their breath for him.\n\nHe took himself to the library because he trusted rooms full of paper to tell the truth without flinching. The librarian had a brooch shaped like a lark and a way of stamping dates like she was pinning butterflies. He told her he needed books on folk songs and she led him to a shelf as if to say, Here are other people's mouths you can borrow. He sat at a table scored by pencils that had lived a long time and traced lyrics with his finger like they might smudge. He read old words that had outlasted the hands that had made them and thought that perhaps that was the least he could ask for a night on a stage: to be a conduit. He hummed into the pages, which was ridiculous and made him feel happy, and the lark-brooch lady didn't scold him, which made him love her. He copied out The Water Is Wide in his own handwriting because he had an idea that if he wrote it down he could carry it with more respect. When he reached the line about leaning on a trusty friend, he smiled without meaning to and thought of a laundrette with a man behind a counter who could hack an election if he felt like it and chose instead to fix people's spin cycles.\n\nHe told Gary his choice and Gary approved with a face that didn't let on that it approved, which is the only way Gary ever approved of anything. \"It's old enough not to sue you and strong enough to keep you upright,\" he said, turning the pronouns in a way that made Tom feel steadied. \"Sing it like you aren't trying to impress anyone you'll never meet. And for the love of everything, do not attempt a key change unless you are offered a knighthood midway.\" Kira listened as if she were learning the shape of a storm and said she would take a long break and stand in the back during the final so he could pretend the dark was full of people who wanted what he wanted. \"Also,\" she added, wiping a glass that had no smudge, \"if Marianne asks you to do your song as a snippet at the dinner, you tell her you will give them a hum and a smile and they can pay for the full show later. No freebies for the penguins.\"\n\nOn Thursday, he went to the hospice because he had written their name on a form and it seemed sensible to show his face to the place he had given his heart. The reception smelled like clean laundry and dignity. A nurse with a tattoo of a forget-me-not on her wrist recognised him from the news and laughed the kind of laugh people do when the world has done something benign and inexplicable. She walked him along a corridor that had soft pictures of trees where there would be windows if money and architecture were kinder. He didn't go into any rooms because he had resolved not to make anyone's last days into a thing that gave him something, but he sang a verse under his breath to the carpet anyway. At the end of the corridor a woman in a green dressing gown sat with her feet in slippers that looked like boats. \"Oh,\" she said, as if she had found a coin. \"You are that caretaker. Sing the river one.\" He did a fragment, nothing that would break the air, and her eyes shone in a way that could have been pain or joy or merely eyes doing their job in a room where something sort-of nice had happened. The nurse squeezed his elbow, which is not a place people often squeeze, and as he left he thought of Nina saying, Don't let them use you, and of how complicated the word them always is.\n\nFriday's rehearsal at the Assembly Hall made him feel like an ant in a jewellery box. He signed his name on a sheet next to other names that had better angles than his did. He watched a girl in a red coat flocked with tiny moths warm up by turning her mouth into a trumpet and admired the efficiency of it. A boy with hair that looked rehearsed had a guitar in a case that could have survived a crash, and an older man with a waistcoat you could draw maps on stood with his hands in pockets like the pockets might talk if he let them. Marianne materialised with her ponytail and her clipboard and the kind of smile you put on when you're about to direct traffic on a motorway no one agreed to stand on. She touched his arm like it was a button that would reassure him and pointed him towards a stagehand called Shaz who smelled faintly of fresh sawdust and wore a radio like a second ear. \"Mic check, love,\" Shaz said, handing him a microphone with tape around it that announced the number 3 as if it were auspicious.\n\nThe stage was a country all of its own. The floor was black and sticky with history and the lights were the kind that don't decide whether to flatter or expose you until it's too late. A man in the back who answered to FOH and Matt in equal measure asked him to say his name and address like a person on a complaint call. He said them and heard his voice come back at him smug and bigger than it had ever been. He thought of what his mother would have said: Stand up straight or you'll tell them you don't mean it. Shaz told him, \"Don't eat the mic, pet. Let it hear you like you trust it. Sing past it, not into it.\" He tried, and the first note snuck out as if worried it was in the wrong place, and then the second drew itself up and the third did something good around the edges. He put one foot in front of the other like the magazine had taught him and tried not to watch himself in his head as he did it.\n\nIn the corner, Marianne watched with two other people who were probably important, if only because they looked like they were rehearsing being unimpressed in case the real thing turned up. She smiled at his chorus with her teeth and at his verse with her eyes and made a note when he tangled his tongue at a line that had never tangled before. \"It's the lights,\" Shaz said later, friendly and fierce in the same sentence. \"They don't just light you. They weigh you. Don't let them. Park your nerves in the wings with the push-brooms. We'll guard them. Go on then, once more for me and imagine you're singing to a wall you love.\"\n\nHe did and the wall obliged him by becoming the river in his head and the corridor at school and his mother's face at two in the morning when the kettle hasn't quite told you yet what it intends. When he finished, Matt in the back nodded, which might have been a trick of the light but felt like a thing a person could put in a pocket. He thanked the air, because there was no one else to thank without looking like a man who needed a hug. The other contestants clapped like people who understood exactly where they were and how much it took to get there, which was to say politely and without the dangerous generosity that can scupper a person who isn't expecting it.\n\nAfter rehearsal, Marianne handed him a lanyard with his face on it in glossy and text that made him look called. \"Le Pingouin on Tuesday,\" she said, the French drifting in her mouth like a decorative fish. \"Seven for seven-thirty. Dress smart. Smart-smart, not just smart.\" He didn't ask her to define it because he was learning that sometimes the trick is to guess and let people tell you how well you guessed afterwards. She mentioned sponsors like a weather forecast: a local bank that had renamed itself after a kind of tree, a chain of garden centres with confusing ambitions, a telecoms firm that turned out to be a man. \"They're lovely,\" she said. \"They all think music saved them and want to return the favour at scale.\"\n\nSaturday he wanted to be useful, so he over-shined the hall floor until it stared back at him offended. He oiled the hinges of the cupboard that refused to let the netballs breathe. He fixed a high window with a pole and a patience that would have chastened monks. Children weren't there and the building made its building noises unselfconsciously; the sighs and ticks and the gurgle in the radiators like someone telling a joke with too much preamble. He sang into the emptiness and it took the sound and laid it down somewhere he couldn't see. He told himself not to think of dinner and failed by lunchtime. He took his new shirt out of its bag and ironed it as if he were flattening a landscape. He borrowed a jacket from the charity shop with lavender and bright wool and it fitted in the way some things fit when you pretend not to care if they don't.\n\nHe called Nina and it rang unusually long, then her voice turned up brisk and textured like toast. He told her when and where and she told him to send a drop pin, which he couldn't, so he promised to text the name and a description of the door. \"Don't let anyone take you outside to show you a car,\" she said, as if this were the kind of place where men in coats would attempt to sell him timeshares in shame. \"Sit near someone you can talk about the weather with if it goes wrong. Weather saves conversations. And if they make you speak, keep it under thirty seconds and say a joke that doesn't ask anyone to laugh. Then everyone will.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Le Pingouin presented itself like a bird that had heard rumours about swans. The windows were glossy and the door had a handle that made your hand feel judged. Inside, everything was flatteringly lit and the tables wore white like a promise. Tom stood in the entrance and tried not to look like he was thinking of carpet stains. Marianne appeared in a dress that would have been a different person if it had a choice and steered him into a room where noise made little fountains in corners. \"Tom,\" she said brightly to a cluster of people who were both one person and many, \"this is Tom Merriweather, our Community Champion wildcard. Tom, these are our partners.\" They said their names and their roles and their companies, and he nodded at the appropriate times and produced his handshake like a good coat.\n\nThe other finalists were arranged like a set of possibilities. Red-coat trumpet-mouth was called Lana and had a laugh she kept under the table where she could kick it if necessary. The boy with the guitar was Dev and he did something in IT that he treated like a hobby when he talked about singing, which made Tom like him more. The waistcoat man was Mr Crozier and he showed his teeth when he smiled as if he were paying tax on the gesture. There was Aisha, seventeen and exacting and accompanied by parents who were trying hard not to look as if they had smuggled their hearts in under their jackets. There were two more: a woman named Paula who ran a choir in Sittingbourne and had very careful hair, and an ex-club singer everyone called Les because that was his name and also because it was the right size.\n\nThey ate things that tasted like concepts before they tasted like food. Tom took small sips of wine and then larger sips of water and looked at the menu as if it had opinions about him. He found the cheapest thing and couldn't order it without confessing, so he picked a chicken dish with a name that had gone to university. Conversation eddied and broke against him and rejoined elsewhere. Someone asked him what time he started work and he said six and they said, \"Oh, your day is our nightmare,\" and he laughed because it was true and not. A woman from the bank asked him if he believed music had the power to heal communities, and he said it had the power to make them stand still for a bit and that was a start, and she wrote that down as if he had said something clever, which he supposed he had by accident.\n\nHalfway through the main course, a man with a tie that resembled a quiet argument stood and tapped a spoon on a glass. The sound made Tom want to reach for a Jacob's cracker. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" the man said, and the room did what rooms do to that phrase. \"What an honour to support such talent. We thought, perhaps, we might persuade one of our fabulous finalists to give us a little foretaste of Friday? Just a bar or two.\" He smiled at the group in a way that made them all feel hospitable. Tom looked at Marianne, whose smile did something not entirely kind to her face and then recovered. Dev was looking studiously at a bread roll as if it had embarrassed him. Lana shook her head once in a small circle that said not tonight in a dialect only performers use. Les was halfway to standing because Les was born standing in rooms like this and sat back down because someone put a hand on his sleeve.\n\nTom felt people glance at him in that way the English have when they want someone else to be brave so they can applaud quietly without admitting to having wanted anything. He thought of Kira's voice in his head telling him no freebies for the penguins and of Shaz saying park your nerves in the wings. He put his napkin down slowly to give himself time not to be heroic. \"I could hum,\" he said, and the table laughed as if he had told a joke, which perhaps he had. \"Or,\" he added, more steady now that he had a sentence sitting in front of him, \"I could say that you'll hear us all properly when we're meant to be heard. I think I'll keep mine for the stage. Or the corridor. I'm very good in corridors.\" There was a ripple that might have been disappointment and might have been respect, and the tie-man nodded like a person who had been refused kindly and knew not to push it.\n\nHe went outside anyway between pudding and speeches because he needed air and also needed the feeling of being in a place he recognised. The alley beside the restaurant smelled of lemons that had been made to suffer and of the back of the world. A kitchen porter in a paper hat stood smoking a cigarette as if it owed him money. \"All right?\" the porter said, as if they were both in a queue for something that might change them. \"I saw you on the telly. My nan fancies you.\" Tom considered the compliment, decided to enjoy it, and laughed. He told the porter he was going to sing a river and the porter said, \"Make it a clean one then. I'm sick of dirty water,\" and dropped his cigarette into a tin of sand like a ceremony. Tom hummed two bars and the alley felt better and then he went in before anyone could decide he'd been gone too long.\n\nThe speeches were as speeches tend to be: time converted into syllables. People said words like platform and journey and passion as if they were buying train tickets. Tom clapped whenever eyes turned to him. He drank his coffee as small as possible because he had seen men make mistakes on the third coffee and didn't want to join them. At the end, Marianne squeezed his shoulder with her hand shaped like a metronome and said, \"You handled that beautifully,\" and he could hear the relief in it like a draught. \"We don't actually want it, you know, the song in the dining room. We only want to say we asked.\"\n\nHe walked back to the station because the night deserved someone to witness it on foot. The windows of the shops were full of things pretending to be asleep. He paused at the old cinema even though it was out of his way and read the names on the marquee, which were not names he knew but did the job anyway. A fox loped across the road like a man late for a meeting he didn't want to attend. He felt, for a brief ridiculous second, that everything had arranged itself carefully so that he could be in this exact spot to feel exactly what he felt, which was the kind of thought that if you pick at it becomes arrogance or a poem.\n\nWednesday morning he found a note under the door at St. Pilgrim's written in pencil on lined paper: Dear Mr Merriweather, will you sing us out on Friday before your big sing? Love, Year 3. Someone had drawn a microphone that might have been a lollipop and a star with more points than was strictly necessary. He showed it to Mrs Penney who made a face like one does when tasting soup that was better than expected. \"Ten minutes at the end,\" she said. \"No sob story. We'll do that at the fete when the summer fails us. We'll have the children hum with you, on the chorus, so you don't get lonely.\" He put the note in his wallet next to Kira's napkin and the strawberry magnet pressed it all flat on his fridge when he got home, because that was how talismans liked to be kept: close together, being quietly useful.\n\nGary kept him from the internet as if he were warding off a cold. \"They've started to discuss you,\" he said at the laundrette, scrolling with his thumb as if politely rubbing a stain. \"You are 'authentic' and 'one of those kooky ones' and someone has written that you're fake and cynical and there to tick a box. That's three out of four internet food groups. Do not read it. I'm not even reading it. I'm reading it for you and telling you not to read it.\" Tom nodded and looked instead at the washing machines going around in their little universes and felt grateful to live in a time when something so ordinary looked like a miracle.\n\nThursday night he paced his bedsit the way a man paces who is not allowed to run away and does not want to. He pressed his hand to the wall where Mr Dray's cough came from when it came, and it didn't, and he thought about knocking and didn't, and then he did knock and Mr Dray opened the door as if he'd been standing just behind it waiting for something to turn. \"Sing into your pillow?\" Mr Dray said without preamble, and when Tom shook his head he said, \"Good. Save it. They'll give you light. Take what you need and leave before the light changes its mind.\" It was more words than Tom had ever heard from him in one breath and it felt like a benediction delivered by a man who had resigned from the priesthood in 1979 and still knew the motions.\n\nHe barely slept and when he did he found himself in the corridor again, the one that had continued beyond itself for the length of a dream, doors numbered in a logic that could not have stood up under cross-examination. He walked past BRAVERY and HUMOUR and REGRET and STOP SINGING, which had been stuck on with playful cruelty. He tried the handle marked WATER and it opened onto a room that was all windows and somewhere there was his mother humming, not to him this time but to herself as if she liked the company. He woke with his mouth open and a note in it he had to swallow.\n\nFriday at St. Pilgrim's had the feel of a day that had remembered itself. The children were noisy without malice. A glue stick went missing and turned up in the place you keep glue sticks when you want to be found. He made a last round that wasn't last and corrected a wobbly display of planets so that Saturn didn't look like a hat. At two-fifty, he stood in the hall and the school collected itself like a flock that had decided to be one thing for five minutes. He told them that songs were bridges you could put down between two places that didn't agree about the river and that if they wanted they could stand on it and look, and they laughed because he sounded like a teacher and he wasn't. He sang The Water Is Wide and asked them to hum the chorus and the hum came, a woolly blanket of sound that covered the floor and the walls and the time between the bell and whatever came after.\n\nWhen he walked off the stage-that-was-a-stage-and-also-a-hall, he didn't trip. His legs felt as if he had gone somewhere far and returned with nothing you could show and everything you could use. The day tightened behind him like a knot that holds. He folded the lanyard he had been told not to fold and put it in his pocket anyway. He put the feather from the cloakroom into his wallet next to the napkin and the note and the form that had named his charity. He checked his tool bag because it calmed him. He told the door on the way out, \"Wish me a light that doesn't lie,\" and the door swung as if to say, You'll have what you have, and that will be enough.\n\nHe met Nina at the bus stop because good sisters arrive at bus stops like small miracles. She hugged him in that older-sister way that is half scolding, half armour. She had brought a bottle of water and a packet of mints and a look that said she could fight a dragon with a biro. \"Don't be late,\" she said, and he said, \"I won't,\" and she said, \"Don't be early either,\" and he laughed because she had, with that one sentence, explained everything about him that needed explaining. They walked to the Assembly Hall without saying anything invented. He could feel the tilt of the earth under his shoes and believed for the first time that he might not fall off. Inside, the lights waited and the seats waited and somewhere in the wings Shaz was waiting with a radio and Matt with a nod, and behind his heart the part of him that had always wanted a small merciless stage had stopped hiding. He stood in the corridor that led to the wings and thought of the rectangle of sunlight by Year 3 and of the cartwheel and of the bow and this time when he raised his arms he didn't sing. He breathed, and the breath was the size of a life.Backstage smelled of paint that had not fully decided to be dry and of metal scaffolds turning light into geometry. Tom stood with his back to a wall that had met more performances than any critic and breathed as if the air had to be persuaded. Nina was beside him with her handbag like a shield and a calm that was ninety percent act, ten percent training. She spoke softly because the space asked for it, the way churches do, and reminded him of things he already knew: that his feet belonged under him, that his mouth could find the shapes it needed, that the worst thing that would happen would be that he would sing and then he would stop. Shaz buzzed past like a friendly wasp, eyes everywhere, radio chattering. She checked his mic pack and smoothed the cable on his shirt as if it were a ribbon on a present she intended to give the room, then told him again not to eat the mic and to sing past it, not into it. He nodded too many times and she gave him a face which translated as, one nod is enough, sweetheart, save the others for later.\n\nThe host strode on in a blue suit that had been chosen by a person who hated blue and the audience responded with that particular British enthusiasm that manages to be loud and self-conscious at the same time. Tom couldn't see much of them yet, just a hint of heads beyond the wings and the curve of the balcony like the lip of a cup. He listened to the patter that warmed them up, the jokes about Tunbridge Wells and parking and how this was the night dreams were made and politely declined, and he felt a wave of affection for people who showed up to be part of something even when they couldn't name what it was. Marianne glided in, clipboard held like a hymn book, and put a hand on his upper arm to steady him or herself. She gave him the order\u2014the first half would belong to three, then an interval and a raffle and a photo op where he would have to stand near a banner that pretended to be a real thing. He was fourth, she said, just after Dev and before Mr Crozier, which felt like standing between a boy at the beginning of a climb and a man who had already decided the view wasn't as good as advertised.\n\nFrom the wings he watched Lana become a mouth made for trumpets and sorrow and light. She sang something he didn't know but recognised the shape of, and the audience made a sound that wasn't clapping, not yet, but was the sound you make when your attention has been captured. She left the stage with her shoulders relaxed by two degrees and didn't look at anyone because she didn't want to let the look turn into anything else. Dev went next and made the guitar behave as if it had applied for the role of spine and been hired. He had the decency to look terrified between verses and charmed during them, which made the audience believe him. Tom clapped in the dark and shook his hands loose the way Shaz had shown him, fingers tingling, wrists warm, and he thought of the hall at school and the rectangular sunlight, which was a much smaller light but had the same merciless kindness.\n\nWhen the stage manager held up three fingers and then two and then one, he stepped forward like a man walking onto a ferry. He hadn't expected the floor to sound like that under his shoes; it sounded like it knew the weight of him and it wasn't offended. The mic stand was at his height already because Shaz was a witch for measurements, and the stage lights did their best to turn him into a person who was both only himself and not singular at all. He looked out and saw not faces but the suggestion of faces, the way you know a flock is birds without counting. He thought of the corridor at St. Pilgrim's and of Mrs Penney\u2019s hybrid smile and of Gary's thumbs-up with a skull, which was how some men say prayer. He breathed again as if it mattered and said his name because the host had asked him to and added, against his own preparations, \"I fix things,\" which was not a sob story and not nothing and made two women in row E look at each other with that pleased surprise people keep for a phrase that tucks under the rib.\n\nThe first note came from far back in him, somewhere near where the winter coats live, and arrived at his mouth intact. He had started gentler in the rehearsals, but the room asked for a thread drawn firmly and so he drew it. The Water Is Wide moved through him as if it had found a riverbed where it had not expected one and decided to be hospitable. He didn't look at the judges with their pens and their medals and their eyes that had seen everything. He looked at a point just beyond the front row where the darkness holds, and then at the corner where a piece of set met its partner and made a right angle that had never hurt anyone, and then at the space above his head where the dust danced like arguments forgiven. He kept his hands mostly still because Shaz had said stillness terrifies rooms in the right way, and because he wanted to see if his mouth was enough.\n\nIn the second verse he heard a cough as delicate as a teaspoon against a saucer and refused to let it be important. He leaned into the lines that knew him and allowed the ones that didn't to borrow his shape for the evening. In the chorus he didn't ask anyone for anything with words, but his voice angled the suggestion at the darkness and a handful of people accepted it without knowing they had. The hum arrived like a mistake everyone agreed to keep, and then grew because it had been welcomed, and then settled into a level that made him feel, for the first time that night, like he was exactly the right size. He didn't smile because smiling would have broken the glass of it, but the corners of his mouth did a thing they hadn't done in months, and Nina in the stalls started to breathe like a person who had been holding it too long.\n\nHe didn't attempt the showy fall-off at the end because he had promised Gary he wouldn't, and because he knew in some older part of himself that landing clean is more honest than attempting air and missing. The last word left him and hung for a second that was three seconds long and then the room returned to itself and clapped, which is what rooms do when they have been given something they hadn't ordered and found they liked. It wasn't a roar, because Kent is careful, but it was layered and warm and it grew when a man in the balcony decided to start it again, as if he'd dropped it and wanted a clean take. He bowed the way Shaz had shown him, small and sincere, and the light did not punish him for it.\n\nThe host came back on with a smile that had been ironed and said words that meant competent and surprising without saying them. The judges spoke their portion as if they were putting a dressing on something that had lived long enough without one. The radio man, who had a blazer that had known better evenings, said he had found the performance \"authentic,\" which is a word that can be friend or enemy, then added that he liked that Tom hadn't been tempted into tricks. The theatre director, a woman with a fringe like a guillotine, talked about the architecture of the song and the way he understood space, which made him want to look under the stage to see which beams she meant. The former pop star, who wore memory like perfume, said his pitch had wobbled at the top of the second verse but that if all wobbles were like that then childbirth would be easier, which earned him a laugh he didn't quite deserve but took anyway. Someone asked him about the hospice and he said one clean sentence and stopped, because he had promised Nina and also because grief blunts a room faster than it sharpens it.\n\nBack in the wings the air felt like the inside of his mouth after mint. He could hear the audience in the corridor of sound they made between acts and it no longer frightened him. Dev appeared and clapped his shoulder with the kind of hope men his age only allow themselves in the presence of guitars, and said something about the run into the third chorus that Tom would not remember properly later. Lana hugged him fiercely and quickly, all cheekbone and salt, and mused that his vowels were very Kent, which she meant as an astonishment. Mr Crozier nodded like a vicar seeing a good harvest and told him to never, under any circumstances, accept a cruise contract without reading the bit about hurricanes. He laughed and found himself wanting to tell his mother everything that had just occurred, which was ridiculous and correct.\n\nMr Crozier went on with a song that had a hundred nights in it and three marriages, and Paula followed with something choral and tidy that unfolded like a map, and Aisha sang like a blade being sharpened and the room remembered how young it isn't. The ex-club singer did the thing men like him do, which is to remind you that a room can be made to stand up even if it doesn't feel like it, and the audience stood for him because he ordered them to and they wanted to. Tom watched it all with the eyes of a man who had been allowed to put his spoon into the bowl and found the soup was shared. He did not compare, because comparing would be to look away from what had happened to him and make it smaller.\n\nInterval came with plastic cups and raffle tickets and a person shouting numbers into a semi-receptive din. Kira and Gary found him in a swipe of corridor where light and dark negotiated and told him what they were allowed to tell him without letting their faces break into the faces they wanted to make. Kira said he had made the room hush like she had seen only twice, once when a brawl had nearly started and once when a footballer had come in after a loss and everyone remembered they were people. Gary said he had not embarrassed himself and then rolled his eyes at himself and added that he had, in fact, more than achieved the brief, which was his way of kissing a man on the forehead without having to be present at the scene. Nina handed him water and a mint and pressed his hand harder than was strictly necessary, and in her eyes he saw the version of him that could go home now and be content even if no one said his name again from the stage.\n\nThey called them all back for a group bow because someone had decided there was time for it. The host spoke about votes, though the judging was mostly already judged, and about journeys, and about the way the region had talent like a hedgerow has sparrows if you'd only pay attention. Tom stood on his mark, which Shaz had made with tape like a small secret, and pretended to have learned how to share space. He held his lanyard in one hand because he liked the weight of his face on plastic and because it grounded him as well as any saint's bone. He looked out and this time he saw a few faces; people do that once the lights settle and the audience forgets to be one organism. He saw someone from the bakery and a kid from Year 6 with a father who looked surprised to be sitting and Mrs Penney in the aisle looking like a woman who approves of nothing and allows everything.\n\nWhen the time came to announce things, the room did that paradoxical thing and tightened while pretending to relax. Marianne stood in the wings counting on her fingers like a person at a bus stop to whom time had become a fruit. The judges murmured together with faces like knotty wood, and the host made an applause line where there didn't need to be one and everyone clapped anyway because it filled a dangerous second. Third place went to Dev, and he grinned with his eyes closed as if he were listening to a song no one else could hear. Second went to Lana, and she shook her head as if to dislodge a year and then bowed so beautifully that Tom wanted to take lessons in humility from her elbows. The first went to Aisha, because the world is occasionally tidy in its judgements, and her parents turned into statues that had to check their joints before they could sit. The roar for her came from teenagers who had arranged themselves in a block like a choir that knows a chant and from grandmothers who recognised what it had been like to have a twelve-note name at seventeen and carry it.\n\nAfter the big three, the sponsors did their bit in a line of photos with handshakes and oversized cheques that looked as if they had been ironed. There was a pause long enough for people to check their phones and then the ex-pop star leaned into the mic and mentioned, almost casually, that there was a special commendation for \"contribution to community,\" which is the kind of phrase that can go either way. He said Tom's name like he had been practising, and the applause happened in that gentle wave again and didn't die too soon, which is the courtesy applause dreams of. They invited him forward and he did his walking and shook the hand of a man who was more telecoms than flesh and held a plaque that would look like a certificate in dim light and a car park voucher in bright. The hospice got a cheque that made a nurse cry somewhere because that's what small cheques do; they arrive in a place that knows how to use small things properly. Tom said thank you and nothing else, because he could feel the hole in the floor that opens for men who think they have more to say than they do and he did not intend to fall into it tonight.\n\nAfter the photos and the thanks and the bit where everyone pretended food was imminent and then found it wasn't, they were released into a lobby that had opinions about carpet. People came up in drifts and told Tom that their cousin or their dog or their late grandfather would have loved that song, which is how humans measure proximity to the holy. A man with a face like an endangered bird said he didn't know the song but felt like he had and that this was a compliment; Tom accepted it as such and watched the man float away, lighter for having said words to a stranger. A local councillor with a tie that meant business told him that the council cared deeply about arts in the community and that perhaps there could be a mural with his face on it, and he laughed until she realised he was laughing and laughed too as if it had been a joke she had told.\n\nIn the corner by a stand of palms that had seen too much, Marianne leaned against a pillar briefly and closed her eyes. When she opened them, she saw Tom looking and gave him a small shrug that in her language equalled confession and relief. She told him quietly that they had worried about the wildcard, that visions of cynical tweets had haunted her, that she had imagined men in newspaper offices making tidy cruelty out of his laces and his face. He said he was glad he had taken that worry from her even if only for a night, and she laughed in shock and then hugged him because people hug men who make their jobs briefly resemble the thing they thought they'd wanted when they were twenty-four and earnest.\n\nWhen the lobby began to empty and the buzz faded to scraps that would be swept up with programmes, he took his plaque and his lanyard and his small important envelope and found a quiet bit of stair that had been painted grey because grey forgives. Nina sat beside him with her shoes in her hand and her chin tilted up like a person letting rain meet it. She told him he had done it, which was both true and unimportant now that it was done, and he told her she had been there, which was both obvious and vital. They didn't talk about Mum and they didn't talk about Dad because their names were in the air anyway eating up oxygen, and after a while they talked about the bus because there had to be something fixed and human to end on.\n\nThe night outside had the particular emptiness that follows crowds. He walked down the hill from the Assembly Hall holding the plaque a little away from his body because he didn't want to accidentally absorb any authority from it that wasn't earned. Gary and Kira peeled off toward the pub with promises of chips and a stern look that said there would be no singing tonight, only salt and vinegar and other ancient cures. Nina headed for her train with the kind of wave you give when you intend to see someone again on purpose, and he turned toward the river because all roads in his head led there now when they could.\n\nHe stood on the bridge as he had stood many times and let the water remind him that you can only step into it as yourself, not as the idea of yourself other people like to hold up like a lantern. The lights on the other side had done what lights do and softened the edges of everything, even the ugly bits, even the bits that had been designed by committees that didn't understand corners. He thought about the hum in the chorus and how it had needed no invitation beyond a steady line and a space to settle. He thought about the corridor at school and the girl doing a cartwheel and how some movements are involuntary and perfect when you are nine and almost impossible later when your bones learn about revenge.\n\nHe went home the long way because winners and losers alike should have to take the long way after any kind of battle. Finnerty's carpets had been locked properly by someone else for once and the stairs felt like they were more interested in holding him than tripping him. In the bedsit he put the plaque on the table next to the strawberry magnet and the napkin and the feather and the folded lanyard, and it looked ridiculous there, as if the table had put on a hat and regretted it. He boiled water twice because kettles are dramatic after big nights and made tea that was almost right. He sat on the bed and let the quiet introduce itself, which it did, politely and a little smug.\n\nSleep was slow to come because his body had decided to turn the night over and examine it for defects. As he lay there, he listened for Mr Dray and heard only the kind of silence that knows what it is doing. He put the palm of his hand against the wall the way you do with animals you want to make friends with and thought, very clearly, that he had placed himself under lights and been seen and had not been burned. He allowed himself a small silly thought that the door at St. Pilgrim's would swing a little easier for him on Monday out of respect, and then he told himself not to anthropomorphise wood and he laughed quietly and it sounded like it belonged to him.\n\nIn the morning, the day resembled other days more than one expects after a night that has dressed itself up. The toast was toast and not a symbol. The tea did its work without grandstanding. He took the plaque down to the carpet shop because Finnerty liked to display local successes next to the Axminster with pride, and Finnerty made a show of giving him a place near the till as if the plaque were a relative stopping by. He walked to St. Pilgrim's with his key ring in his palm and the key ring felt the same weight as ever and he did not resent it. The building flexed its muscles and yawned in pipes and gullies and allowed him in, and he told the doors good morning and meant it in a way he had not known he was capable of.\n\nChildren are excellent barometers of change; they decide which weather to believe in within seconds and rarely revise. In the Year 3 corridor, a boy with a cliff for a forehead asked him if he'd met anyone famous and Tom told him he had met himself, which made the boy pull a face as if presented with broccoli. In the hall, a Year 5 girl performed a sarcastic curtsy as she passed him and then turned it into a real one because she had misjudged the day and wanted to adjust. Sandra held his elbow and told him she'd recorded it and watched it twice and cried on the second time because the first was reconnaissance. Mrs Penney looked at him with her shoes pointing in a different direction, which is how she told him she was pleased and needed to be on time for Year 2's phonics regardless.\n\nHe fixed a locker that had learned to stutter and enjoyed the exactness of bolts. He uncoiled the hose and told it that it had never looked more serpentine and it allowed itself to be amused. The mop watched him from the corner with a level of respect it had previously reserved for visitors from the council. At lunch, he went to The Oast House and Kira tried to make him eat something with an egg on top and he declined and then accepted because she knew when he was being noble for no audience. Gary arrived late with eyes that had slept and printed a photo of him under the lights from a place on the internet where kindness had happened without supervision and sat it on the table like a small, harmless god.\n\nIn the days that followed, the world did not call him to bigger stages, which was a comfort if he was honest and a disappointment if he was being a clich\u00e9. There were a few emails that Marianne forwarded, some from people who wanted him to sing at fundraisers and one from a man who wanted to sell him slippers that corrected posture. He said yes to the first kind with the hospitality he had been shown and no to the second with the brevity the internet requires. He went to the hospice on a Thursday with the cheque and the nurse with the forget-me-not on her wrist grinned like a girl at a fair and let him sing in the corridor two full verses this time because a woman in Room 4 had asked and because rules are made by people who have never had to measure hours like that.\n\nSomething in him had been rearranged, but it wasn't a furniture you could point at. It was more like someone had moved a plug to a different wall and he could charge parts of himself he hadn't been able to before. He found himself humming when he fixed things and not worrying if anyone heard unless they were taking a test. He found that some of the children hummed back when they were supposed to be fetching lunchboxes, and he pretended to scold them and didn't really. He found that when he walked past the mural that currently said THIS IS YOUR MOMENT he didn't instinctively reach for a pen to edit it. He thought of adding and tomorrow too, but he decided the wall had earned a day off from commentary.\n\nNina phoned on a Sunday and told him that their Auntie Kel had seen him via a nephew's Facebook and had thoughts about trousers. He listened and agreed to disagree about the hems because there is a kind of argument that keeps people in the right relation to each other if conducted with enough tea. She asked him, at the end, quiet in her mouth, whether he was all right with having had a night and then returning to days, and he thought about lying and didn't. He told her it had been like standing under a waterfall and then walking to the corner shop, that both activities had turned out to be more related than he would have guessed. She told him he had always been a poet even when he was trying to be a cupboard and laughed at herself with affection.\n\nOn a damp Tuesday, he found a slip of paper in his pigeonhole at school with a note in a child's hand declaring that he should start a singing club because otherwise how would anyone know how. He held it and thought of rooms he could make slowly and carefully; rooms where humming was the weave and glue was permitted and posters were hand-drawn and the door would always be slightly ajar. He took the paper to Mrs Penney as if he were offering a foundling and she pursed her lips as if tasting soup again and said they'd make a slot on Wednesdays if he promised not to cause a riot. He promised to cause only manageable revolutions and she nodded like a queen being generous after a nap.\n\nThe first club met in the gym store because there was a plug and enough echo to flatter small braveries. Six children arrived and then two more and then Aisha's younger brother turned up with a recorder which he brandished like a weapon and was reassured was welcome. They sang a bit and talked a lot and he discovered that the thing he enjoyed more than singing for people might be convincing people that they can do it too, that their voices are not accidents but instruments with dust you can blow off. He taught them The Water Is Wide in a key that didn't frighten anyone and when they hummed the chorus he closed his eyes for a second and thought of the Assembly Hall and of how space can be persuaded to listen if you speak to it kindly.\n\nWhen he walked home that evening there was a thin light that can't be relied upon but makes promises anyway. Finnerty's sign clicked on with hope and the bedsit smelled like whatever Mr Dray had cooked\u2014something with onions and something else that felt proprietary\u2014and he stood in the doorway and felt, with what he realised was surprise, that his life fitted him. It was not a tailored thing. It didn't sit on the shoulders as if a man in a tape measure had sighed over it; it was a good charity-shop jacket that he had warmed into shape and that now felt like it would resist rain longer than it had a right to. He put the kettle on and it hissed its approval and he sang half a verse to the teapot because he could and because the room had earned a lullaby without an audience. The song floated into the corners and settled with the dust and with what had always been there, and if the mops stiffened a little less and the hinges minded their manners, well, that was only fair.It wasn't a new beginning exactly, but the days grew edges he could feel with his fingers. If he had been the sort of man to number things he'd have said it was chapter six, though he didn't write in chapters and he certainly did not keep an index. What he noticed instead was that the morning light came into his bedsit with a new habit of tapping at the glass, and that the kettle, when it boiled, sounded less like a reprimand and more like encouragement. He went to St. Pilgrim's with his ring of keys spinning a little faster than they had, like small moons taking their cue from a parent planet that had remembered to pull. The building greeted him with its usual creaks and he greeted it with his usual murmurs, but the conversation had shifted by a degree; it was as if the walls had decided to take him at his word.\n\nThe singing club began with six children and accrued two, then shed one to football and gained one from netball and ended up with nine, which felt like a number books liked. He ran it in the gym store because the echo there was friendly and the plug was in a place that didn't argue with extension leads. They began with humming because humming was democratic, then graduated to a round that made the space stack itself into a new shape. There was a boy called Keir who wanted to turn everything into beatboxing and a girl called Amara who sang so quietly that the sound seemed to draw itself with a pencil, and an older sister who arrived to collect a younger one and pretended not to care until she failed at pretending and stayed. Tom stood and moved his hands the way he'd seen conductors do on telly and discovered that the trick wasn't to command but to invite, and that if you left a gap people filled it with courage.\n\n\"What's the point of a singing club?\" a Year 4 boy asked bluntly on the second week, poking at the concept like it might be undercooked. \"We're not a choir. We don't even have uniforms.\"\n\n\"The point is to breathe together in a room,\" Tom said, pleased to hear himself say it and slightly appalled at the poetry of it. \"And to make something that didn't exist before the bell went. Also, biscuits on the last Thursday.\" The last sentence made immediate sense. He had learned that sugar bridged any gap that metaphysics couldn't.\n\nWhen he wasn't coaxing voices out of children he was building a universe out of cardboard because Goldilocks in Space had a deadline and Year 2 had expectations that were at once vague and adamant. The donkey-ship had grown a nose cone and a tail that looked like ambition. He had begged elastic bands from the office and bought silver paint with his own money after someone in the PTA declared that glitter was microplastic and therefore immoral. He hummed while he glued because it made the glue less sulky. He scraped a line of dried PVA off the tabletop with his thumbnail and thought about how all technologies end up being about holding and letting go in the right doses.\n\nAt The Oast House, Kira put a chalkboard up near the till that read, in an uncharacteristically neat hand, Singing Club Cake Sale, Friday 3:30, Please Be Nice. She claimed she would make brownies that could settle disputes between kingdoms and dared Tom to sing Mozart with his mouth full. Gary, who had rolled his eyes at the idea of helping in public and then turned up with a float tin and a cheap card reader that required coaxing, declared every fourth slice to be on the house if the purchaser could name a folk song that hadn't had its words changed by at least three great-aunts. Tom watched them and felt the odd ache of being held in place by a web of people who could find jokes in seriousness without untying the knot.\n\nMarianne rang on a Wednesday just after he'd retrieved a small pair of wellies from a gutter and was feeling benevolent. \"How would you feel about a feature?\" she asked, and he nearly dropped the phone because he'd never been asked how he'd feel about a feature before, unless you counted his dentist. It would be a \"where are they now\" for the regional show in three months, she said, a little piece to check in on his community heroism and perhaps find out whether he had been corrupted by fame. He laughed because he had not, unless you counted buying a second shirt. She laughed back in the way professionals do when they are pleased by an answer that fits a narrative they've already drafted. \"We'll call nearer the time,\" she said, which he now knew translated to, We will call when we need to fill three minutes and we think your face will be kind to our viewers.\n\nThe weather turned showy the way spring in Kent likes to, performing four seasons across a morning. One minute the Medway lay polite as a ribbon and the next it shrugged itself brown and busy. He stared down over the railings on the way to work and thought about the line in the song that had made people hum without being asked, and he decided that the river was not any one thing; it was a collection of attempts. He liked being an attempt. Attempts had more room to move in.\n\nOfsted announced themselves with an email that made the staffroom tilt. Mrs Penney read it aloud in a tone that suggested she could disarm a bomb if asked, and the room made the noises of people recalling the very best bits of themselves at speed. Lists appeared on the whiteboard with arrows that turned into new lists, and everyone said safeguarding to each other in the way people say hello in churches. Tom was handed a stack of policies thick enough to prop up a wobbly table and asked, very nicely but indisputably, to ensure that every door closed as if it had been designed by a manufacturer with a conscience.\n\n\"We don't have any time for singing,\" Mrs Penney told him shortly, which meant she had too much affection to lie. \"It is all paperwork and bleaches until Friday. Hide the donkey. The donkey is an Ofsted temptation.\"\n\n\"We could get Outstanding for the donkey alone,\" he protested mildly. \"It has emotional depth.\"\n\n\"It has a nasal cone held on by elastic bands, Mr Merriweather,\" she said, but she softened it with a glance at the cardboard and the way his hand had absently found the grain of the glue. \"All right, the donkey can survive in a neutralised environment. Put a sign on it that says This Is A Placeholder.\"\n\nThe first inspector to stride into St. Pilgrim's had a notebook with corners sharp enough to cut bread and a smile like a polite apology. Tom hovered at the edges of their path with his tool belt cinched and his mop behaving like a soldier at attention. He opened doors for them that had been oiled into compliance and said good morning in five different levels of sincerity because he didn't have time to check which tone matched which person. He liked two of them immediately and decided to be competent in front of the third. He fixed a sudden tantrum in the Year 4 dip taps and stood by in the corridor while the lead inspector stopped at the safeguarding board and nodded in that way that suggested boxes were being gently ticked. The children were unnerved for the first hour and then remembered they had small lives to get on with, which was a relief to everyone.\n\nAt breaktime, a girl from the singing club snuck up to him with the stealth of a cat and asked if they would still meet later. \"Just humming,\" she bargained, eyes large, as if humming could be smuggled under the inspection radar. He considered the timetable of the day, the plank of policies, the width of the corridor and his own capacity for mischief, then nodded. \"Humming in a whisper,\" he said, and she grinned like the strike of a match.\n\nThey hummed at lunch, nine of them with biscuits they had not technically been allocated by any system that would hold up in court. It sounded like a kettle not quite ready to confess, and it made the gym store feel conspiratorial and safe. He liked that they were doing something gentle and possibly illegal, which is the best category of things in schools if you are careful. When an inspector passed in the corridor and peered in, he raised a hand and said, \"Repairing echo,\" and she smiled properly because she was human and once sang alto in a choir in Cheltenham.\n\nOfsted left with a verdict that could be described as tidy and the staff drank tea in mugs that had been acquired at summer fetes and glared victoriously at the photocopier as if it were an enemy vanquished. Mrs Penney thanked him in front of people, which she rationed like sugar, and added, as if the universe owed her a balancing clause, that budgets would be a problem by May. He knew what that meant without needing Nina to translate. It meant that positions acquired adjectives like non-essential and discretionary and that sometimes people who knew where things were kept were told to put them down and leave.\n\nHe found the mural had been over-painted again when he took his long way home, the YOU ARE GOLD gone in favour of a scrawl that browned at the edges: YOU ARE HERE, which struck him as both either/or and exactly right. The letters sagged a little, but then so did he in the right light. There was a new tag underneath that looked like pool balls scattered in a triangle without the triangle, and he wondered for the first time about the hands that did this under cover of night and whether they ever came to his cake sales.\n\nMr Dray knocked two evenings after Ofsted had gone as if the inspection had approved his right to appear. He stood with his cough tucked away and his hair trying to remember it existed. \"I have a spare forecast,\" he said, with the formality of someone delivering a family heirloom. \"Shipping. I recorded it for my brother who never liked the nights and then he died and I kept the habit, and, well. I've got one left over, if you wanted to see what my living room sounds like.\" Tom could think of no answer that sounded less than sentimental and more than adequate, so he made tea and carried it upstairs where the carpets muffled worries and the furniture was arranged like it had been given instructions by a person who trusted corners.\n\nThey listened to the shipping forecast in the odd reverence it commands if you let it. It had been dropped into the room from another age and sat there smelling of salt you couldn't actually smell. Tom knew the names because he had borrowed them in the nights when he wanted syllables instead of thoughts, but hearing them with Mr Dray had altered the weight of them; Viking, North Utsire, South Utsire, Cromarty, Forties, Bailey, Fair Isle, Faeroes, Southeast Iceland. They were incantations that did not pretend to fix anything but had the decency to try. \"I did the radios once,\" Mr Dray said, eyes on the patch of wall that had been scaffold for a different life. \"On ships. Men with hands like spanners saying words into boxes and hoping the air had learned to listen. You can sing at the air if you teach it. Took me too long to work that out.\"\n\n\"I sang to a wall in Tunbridge Wells,\" Tom confessed, relieved to have a man in front of whom admissions could be made without fuss. \"A woman told me I had used space correctly. It felt like being told I'd cut up an onion properly and being moved to tears at the same time.\"\n\n\"You'll be careful,\" Mr Dray said, in the voice of a man who has deployed his ration of advice in fits and starts across too many years. \"The light makes people think they are saints or thieves. Most of us are electricians, really. Wires. Circuits. Fixing the bit that made the thing go dark.\"\n\nTom went home from the forecast feeling like he'd been allowed to touch a book in a museum. He slept badly because Ofsted had dislodged a weight he had been using to hold the furniture still, and now things were shifting again. He dreamed of doors with signs on them that changed when he blinked. OPEN morphed to NOT YET and then to WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING and then to PLEASE, which he supposed was a fair representation of his heart.\n\nThe day of Goldilocks in Space brought in grandparents who smelt of mints and optimism and siblings whose knees were made of questions. The donkey-ship rolled into the hall with a solemnity nobody had anticipated and then refused to turn left at the point where it was critical to turn left. Tom coaxed it as if it were a nervous dog and the audience clapped in that defusing way people do when a child forgets a line and someone in the third row says, Oh love, and everyone decides to love them. The play was a delightful catastrophe, which is to say it did the important things and none of the unimportant ones. Goldilocks discovered oxygen and sat on a geologically unwise chair and the Captain of the spaceship learned about porridge viscosity, and Tom moved behind the curtains like a man doing small honest miracles and felt himself in his element in the dark.\n\nThe cake sale made the corridor smell like every Thursday had decided to stand still and be grateful. The brownies were the kind of sticky that arranges peace treaties, and Gary's card reader failed in ways that made him swear softly and invent new forms of contactless that involved eye contact and hope. An old lady from the hospice appeared with a twenty-pound note that she crisply flattened on the table and a story about a lad in 1978 who had sung Danny Boy during a power cut and made all the babies sleep. By the end of the hour they had raised enough to buy new songbooks and a pack of biscuits that could calm small armies, and Tom took the money to the office with an expression he reserved for carrying hot liquids.\n\nIt was in the middle of that small domestic triumph that the email about budgets turned into a meeting that had the feel of a weather warning you could smell. Mrs Penney sat with a document printed on paper that knew it was not enough, and behind it was a table that had borne many hurried lunches and occasional weeps. \"We have been asked to model scenarios,\" she began, which is the sort of sentence that kills appetite. \"One of the scenarios is that the caretaker role goes from full-time to half-time. It is not the one I like. It is the one that has been put in front of me by a man with smooth shoes. I am telling you because I prefer to keep loyalty between us and not test it.\"\n\nHe watched the paper in her hands because it was easier than watching her face. He felt the familiar tightening of the day at the edges, the way it does when someone has lifted a glass and you realise it's you and the world will watch to see whether you will spill. \"You need a full-time person,\" he said, hearing the ridiculousness of stating the obvious with a logic that wanted something better than obvious in response. \"The pipes don't go part-time and neither does the glue. Children break things on a schedule that mocks calendars. You need two of me most weeks and a spare on Tuesdays.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said simply, and there was a fatigue in her voice that was not about sleep. \"I will fight for you. I may not win. You will not be blindsided, whatever happens, because I will not have that. There is a possibility in here\"\u2014she tapped the sheet as if it were a recalcitrant animal\u2014\"about moving you over to the trust's big site as a facilities assistant. It would be more money and less community. I do not know if it's the sort of thing that would keep you upright.\"\n\nHe thought of glass doors and lanyards that didn't have the right weight. He thought of a place where a singing club would be a form to fill rather than a biscuit to share. He thought of the river and the corridor and the janitor's cupboard, which smelt consistently of yesterday and had taught him to trust repetition. \"I'll think,\" he said, and she nodded because she knew that this was his way of shouting.\n\nThe mural had acquired a thin figure in chalk when he walked past it that evening, a personified stick man holding a broom like a standard and a speech bubble that declared, WHO CLEANS UP THE STARS. He stopped and laughed, then looked around to see if the artist was leaning nearby, acting like he didn't care. A boy who might have been sixteen with a face that had not yet found a category lurked by the bins, pretending to be married to his phone. Tom held up a thumb and the boy shrugged in that capacious way teenagers have, and then smiled at the ground which, in teenage language, is often a yes.\n\nNina sent a message that made his phone light up like a sensible promise: Come up Saturday. I have roast. Also a friend I want you to meet who is not a romance, so calm down. He calmed down and said yes and then spent fifteen minutes catastrophising about trains before remembering that people had been catching them before phones had learned tricks. He looked at his bedsit and made a list in his head of the objects he liked as if he were saying goodbye to them, which was absurd and instructive. The teapot. The potato peeler with the nick in the handle. The post-it with his name. The feather in his wallet that hadn't flown but had consented to be carried.\n\nSaturday in Gravesend brought Nina's kitchen, which had been tamed into a place where jars knew their names. She wore an apron as if it owed her money and ignored the roasting pan's complaints. The friend turned out to be a man named Roland who ran something at a community radio station and had hair that had committed to being two styles at once. He talked about microphones as if they were pets and invited Tom to come on a late-night show to talk about songs that had saved people if he wanted, which felt like the kind of temptation you could accept without losing anything you couldn't afford. Nina poured gravy with the determination of a general and told Tom he looked handsome, which in her mouth was almost always a dare to disagree. They ate and argued about trains and he told her about the scenario plan and she swore like a Christian and put more carrots on his plate. After tea, Roland played him the jingles for his show and Tom smiled through them because there are parts of modern life you have to submit to with grace to get to the parts that nourish.\n\nHe went home on a train that paused at stations long enough for him to decide if he lived there. He watched small allotments glide by in their diorama earnestness and thought about growing things that didn't ask to be big, which was what he had been trying to do in his cupboard of a life. He fell asleep for six minutes and woke with the picture of a tap in his head and felt a tenderness for it that made him laugh to himself, and the woman across the aisle smiled at him as if she saw the joke.\n\nThe week decided to be long and succeeded. On Tuesday the pipe behind the Year 1 cloakroom remembered how to explode and did, and there was a small river down the corridor before Tom could make it into a stream and then into a sulk. He waded in his socks because there wasn't time to bother with anything else and the children watched him like a man in a nature documentary and started to narrate him in whispers. A small boy in wellies asked if this was like the Medway and Tom said yes but nicer, and the boy walked away with the satisfied air of someone who had just had geography become personal. He called the plumber and the plumber was a man who treated emergencies like opportunities for anecdotes, and the two of them got the pipe to stop telling its life story. He wrung his socks out in the sink and felt heroic in the way that matters.\n\nIt was that afternoon, while his socks steamed quietly on the radiator in the cleaner's cupboard and he was barefoot in his boots like a fisherman of corridors, that a woman from the trust arrived with an expression like a policy. She wore a coat that didn't crease and smelt of a perfume that tried to be neutral. \"Hello,\" she said, locating him with her eyes as if he had been an item on a list and she was pleased to have found it. \"I'm here to have a chat about flexible deployment across the trust estate. Can we talk in your\u2026 office?\"\n\n\"My office is a cupboard,\" he said, with undefensive pride. \"You will have to fold.\"\n\nShe folded elegantly and declined a chair because the chair made excuses. She explained what he already knew in longer sentences, and then she asked the question that had been humming under the others. \"How attached are you to Pilgrim's?\" she asked, and he tried to answer without the melodrama of a man who writes songs for pipes. He told her the truth, which was that he was attached as a person is attached to the mug he drinks out of every morning, and that sometimes the mug is chipped but your hand has learned the chip and to ask it to accept a saucer would be rude. She looked at him in the way of people who are both taking notes mentally and checking their hair in their head. \"We will be pragmatic,\" she said eventually, which meant nothing and everything. \"I appreciate your\u2026 local capital.\"\n\n\"Kira says I'm more of a lowercase,\" he said lightly because it was that or say a thing that would not help either of them. They left it there because sometimes you must, and she took her coat and her smell away and he stood in the cupboard with his socks attempting sainthood and sang one line into the mop so he wouldn't swear.\n\nThe radio show with Roland happened on a Thursday that smelt of wet newspaper. The studio was small and industrious and filled with pieces of equipment that had opinions. Roland gave him headphones that made him feel like a man about to be important and a mug that said Tea Before Talent. They talked between songs about the way music makes rooms decide to behave, and people called in with voices that had been softened by midnight. A lorry driver by the Dartford Crossing told him that he sang to stay in his lane when the rain fought him, and a lady called Eileen offered that she had sung to her geraniums for thirty-seven years and nobody had died yet, which must count. Tom sang a little because it would have been rude to turn up and refuse, and the microphone was the forgiving kind that finds something good even in a voice that trembles. When they played the shipping forecast at the end because Roland had found a recording for him, he closed his eyes in a room not built for closing eyes and felt for a moment like all the names belonged to him and none of them stuck.\n\nHe expected to be embarrassed at hearing himself when he got home and wasn't, which made him suspect that perhaps he had turned a corner and not noticed. He went up the stairs and paused at Mr Dray's door because the shipping forecast had done that thing where it rearranges the furniture of your chest. He knocked and waited and got nothing. He put his ear to the wood and heard a quiet that was louder than the shipping forecast ever was. He tried the handle because boundaries are real until they're not and found it not locked. He said the man's name the way you do when you don't want to frighten it and walked in.\n\nMr Dray was on the floor in the place where the carpet had given up long ago, a man who had watched the weather for others and now needed his own weather reported. Tom didn't think of the right things. He thought of tea first because he was English, then he thought of calling the ambulance because he belonged to a century that had taught him a number, and then he was doing both at once and somehow his hand was on the man's shoulder, which felt like a sensible place to put a hand. The phone made its endless questions and he answered like a man who had practised in movies. He spoke in metres and breaths and kept his own voice quiet because there is nothing more panic-making than someone else's panic arriving to join your own.\n\n\"Sing,\" Mr Dray said unexpectedly, his mouth doing the work his chest could not. It wasn't a theatrical request. It was diagnostic. Tom sang because of course he did, not loudly, not the way you sing to rooms, but the way you sing to a baby that hasn't decided about the world yet. He chose something with a tune that didn't ask anyone to climb and made two notes do the work of six. The ambulance came with the displeasure of professionals who have seen too many floors and gathered him up and took him into the night with a speed that felt like rudeness and respect both. Tom followed as far as the curb because men like him don't get to ride in other people's emergencies unless they are invited, and then he stood a long time and watched a patch of tarmac learn silence again.\n\nThe hospital smelt like hope and ketchup. He sat in A&E on a chair that had opinions and waited because he had nothing else that would help. A woman with hair like a question mark asked him what the relationship was and he said neighbour and it came out like brother because sometimes that's the same thing. He texted Nina because you text the person who will put the thing into a box you can carry, and she told him to ask for an update every hour even if the desk told him no because the trick with hospitals is to be politely present. He did as he was told and was told very little and considered himself lucky because the telling had not been bad. He went home at three when the receptionist turned the lights up slightly in an attempt to make everyone go home without saying the words, and he slept the way people sleep who have to take their dreams in sips.\n\nHe told Kira in the morning and she swore beautifully and made him a coffee that could have done masonry. He told Gary and Gary said he would go and sit in the hospital for him as if waiting could be outsourced, then went anyway because some things are not determined by language. He told Mrs Penney and she was brisk and kind and told him to go in an hour late because she trusted him not to stretch an hour into a day. He went to St. Pilgrim's to tell the mop and the hinges and then he went back to the hospital and found that Mr Dray was mended enough to be cross. They spoke in the way men speak when they intend to cover later with jokes what they feel in the instant. Tom left with a small list in his pocket\u2014milk, bread, a particular kind of apple\u2014the way people leave altars with candles.\n\nThere were emails waiting at home because the world is poor at moderating itself. One was from the trust with a preliminary schedule of meetings where his role would become a line weighted by numbers. One was from Marianne with a suggestion of dates in July for a television thing that would require him to be filmed painting a fence he hadn't planned to paint. One was from someone who had seen him on Roland's show and wanted him to sing at a wedding in August in a marquee that would probably pretend to be waterproof. He said yes to the wedding because he liked the idea of singing to love while it tried to dress itself without catching its hem, and he wrote to Marianne to say that if they were going to film him, they could film him moving chairs in a way that would make his back feel seen. He wrote to the trust to thank them for sending the document and asked if he could send them a list of things that go wrong in a week that aren't on a spreadsheet. He did not receive an answer that day, which did not surprise him.\n\nThe school summer fete arrived with bunting that looked like arguments settled for the afternoon. There was a tombola manned by a PTA stalwart with eyes like a hawk and a cake stall that had discovered that paper plates were a lie. The caretaker had been asked to set up the tables, then asked to run the tug-of-war, then asked to judge the pet talent show, then asked to be at two places at once and had agreed to all of it with the absent courage of a man who likes to be needed more than he likes the idea of sitting. His singing club had a slot on the small stage that had been borrowed from the Scouts and he had rehearsed them until they were bored and hungry, which was the correct amount. They sang The Water Is Wide because of course they did, and they did it like a group of nine children with wider ranges than their ages, and the parents hummed and so did a man who might have been a distant uncle and so did a woman from the hospice who had come to buy a jar of jam and stayed for a chorus. He looked out and saw not the Assembly Hall but the exact corner of the field where the clover had decided to try again, and he felt, more than thought, that this might be the proper use of his voice.\n\nHe went home that night sun-tired and full in that way fetes do to you when the bunting has been taken down and the grass bears the imprint of tables. He put the cash box on the table with its strawberry magnet and its plaque and its feather and it looked like a shrine to small civic duties. He poured himself lemonade and stood at the window and watched the evening do its tidy folding and thought of the teenager with the chalk and the stick man and wanted, quite suddenly, to write on walls. He did not because he was a caretaker and the job is simple and confusing: you clean up after things, but you also decide what mess is worth keeping. He made a list of repairs in his head and it sounded like a song and he laughed out loud because sometimes sentences do that.\n\nIt occurred to him, in the days after, that there might be a way to fight for his job that didn't involve shouting at people in coats. He started to gather stories like bolts. He wrote down the time he stopped a pipe from telling secrets to a corridor. He wrote down the afternoon a child who didn't speak much had told him her father sang badly and it made her feel safe. He wrote down the morning he had found a burnt plug just before it could become a lesson in fire and gratitude, the evening he had held a teacher's hand in the storeroom while she pretended not to cry because a relationship had decided to end without consulting her timetable. He wrote down the hum. He wrote down the way corridors were thinner on days when the rain couldn't decide, and how a man with a mop could make them wider. He wrote down that he sang and that some days the song fixed things he couldn't reach. He wrote all of it in his own handwriting because he trusted it more than fonts.\n\nHe took the pages to Mrs Penney and put them in front of her like a practical offering. She read and did the thing she does when touched, which is to clear her throat as if there had been dust. \"This is not a petition,\" she said, which puzzled him until she smiled in that two-thirds way that had become their language. \"It's better. It's evidence.\" She took the pages to a meeting and left them there like a helpful ghost. The man with the smooth shoes read and did whatever men with smooth shoes do when confronted by a list of small things that threatened to make their big things look silly. Nothing changed that day. This is not that sort of story. But the shoes might have scuffed at the edges, and in July when the trust proposed the part-time line, a governor who had carried his own list with him to adulthood argued until the letter of offer acquired the phrase to be reviewed in twelve months, which is not much but it lets a man breathe for another winter.\n\nOn a Thursday that might have been August, he stood on the bridge and watched the river shrug and thought about water he couldn't name. He had a wedding in a marquee on Saturday and a hospice corridor on the Thursday after and a girl in Year 3 whose mother had promised to bring her on Wednesdays for the club because it had become the thing they shared that didn't cost a miracle. He had the trust meeting in September where his job had to be translated into money in a room that had never met a corridor with a leak. He had Kira at the pub who had started to hum while she polished glasses and stopped apologising for it. He had Gary who pretended the internet didn't matter and then made it do what he wanted when it was useful to him. He had Nina who could turn a roast into a manifesto and had promised to come down for the arts week and heckle gently. He had Mr Dray who had returned to his chair like a man who had reupholstered his existence and now found it adequate, and who had forbidden him, on pain of derisive snort, to bring him a fruit basket.\n\nOn his way back past the mural, there was a new phrase, neat and almost shy beside the chalk outlines: YOU ARE HERE, WE ARE HERE. He ran a finger along the R like a man checking that paint had dried and then walked away because the wall did not need him to bless it in public. He went up the stairs to the bedsit and the hinges congratulated him for not falling down and he sang one verse to the teapot and one to the mop and one to the part of himself that still thought he needed permission. He lay on his bed and looked up at Norway and thought about what to do with the next long corridor the world would offer him, and he slept before the answer had a chance to make a mess.\n\nThe wedding was on a farm with a marquee that sweated lightly and an aunt who had commandeered the buffet with an energy that suggested she had been waiting her whole life for her canap\u00e9 moment. The bride had a laugh that did not ask anyone to behave and the groom cried in a way that improved his face. Tom sang where he could be useful, which was at the bit between speeches and dancing when people's attention wanders like sheep. He sang The Water Is Wide because the couple had asked for a folk song and then, because the bride's grandfather had requested it in a voice that could still turn a room, he sang a verse of The Parting Glass, which he had once thought belonged to other people but discovered, in that moment, belonged to anybody willing to mean it. The tent breathed and the fairy lights considered him without judgement and a child fell asleep under a table and he felt tired in his spine and happy in his feet. He took his envelope money with embarrassment and then accepted it like a grown man accepts pay, and he gave half of it to the hospice on Monday because he'd promised himself that when he earned with his throat he would pay his debt to the corridor.\n\nBy the end of summer the singing club had a song of their own about St. Pilgrim's that rhymed glue with through in a way that redeemed both words. They had asked to perform it at assembly and had been advised by Mrs Penney that the world was not yet prepared, and then she booked them for five minutes on the last day anyway, which is how she does kindness without denting her reputation. They made posters by hand because printers are not to be trusted, and Kira came in her day clothes and Gary stood at the back pretending to fix a socket and Mr Dray sat in the aisle with his radio ear turned on, and for five minutes a school hall tilted toward the right. After, in the corridor, the children said thank you in voices that didn't quite know where to put their new bigness and Tom said you're welcome in a way that didn't make a fuss, and Sandra cried because she does and then laughed at herself because she also does that.\n\nSeptember went back on, as it always does, like a cardigan that smells of pencil cases and rain. The trust meeting happened in a room that had a carpet designed to dissuade comfort and a water cooler that made confidential noises. He brought his pages and his stories and his list of repairs and wore his shirt that had been careful for him in Tunbridge Wells. They discussed headings and figures and the meaning of essential and in the end the compromise was a promise dressed in a formality; he would stay in place with the threat of being redistributed hovering like weather, and there would be a review, and he would be invited to contribute to the long-term facilities plan as if his hands had been suddenly noticed by the plan's eyes. He left with fatigue that wrapped itself around his ribs and with a small laminated card that asserted his expertise, which he put in his wallet next to the feather because both things needed safe keeping.\n\nHe walked home along the river because even when life is mercilessly practical, the Medway will do you a favour if you let it. The water was not doing anything impressive and he loved it for that. He breathed and tilted his head like a man listening for train announcements and heard only air that had been through lungs before, and he was grateful. He turned towards Finnerty's and the bedsit and the shipping forecast that would declare its small sovereignties later and the doors at St. Pilgrim's that would swing tomorrow without taking offence, and he thought, with a steadiness that surprised him, that whatever having a chapter meant, he had one and it was his to keep or misplace as he liked. He decided to keep it, and he decided to keep it with other people, and the decisions, for once, felt like turning a screw until it held and knowing when to stop.Autumn fell into its habit of pretending to be winter early, the way some people try out a haircut before they've made up their minds. The Medway wore a shawl of mist that didn't keep it warm, and the mornings had a crispness that made keys drag on their ring like old bones. St. Pilgrim\u2019s returned to its palette of navy and grey and mud, and the corridors remembered how to smell of wet coats and ambition. Tom swore he could hear the building brace, small adjustments in pipes and frames as if an orchestra had lifted instruments to their chins and settled before the first note. He did the same with his day. The singing club met on Wednesdays in the gym store and on Thursdays wherever there was a plug that hadn't been claimed by a laminator, and in between he fixed things with the devotional cheer of a man who has given up on miracles and begun to trust ritual.\n\nThe mural had been repainted decisively and then embellished sheepishly. YOU ARE HERE had sprouted a neat additional pronoun: WE. Beneath it the stick man with the broom had been joined by a stick woman with a bucket and a crown, and somebody had drawn a figure with a microphone and a key ring the size of Saturn. Tom took this as evidence that the teenager with the phone and the surrogate shrug had either been busy or had acquired allies. He began to look for the boy deliberately on his way home and found him twice and pretended, both times, that he was not looking. Their conversation blossomed the way teenage conversations do with adults they have not yet decided are police: sideways, over time, and with an emphasis on weather.\n\n\"You draw?\" Tom asked eventually, in a tone he reserved for questions he was willing to watch die ungathered.\n\n\"I design,\" the boy replied, without arrogance. \"I only draw when the wall's right. Can't waste lines on bad wall.\"\n\n\"That wall's had so many coats it ought to have a winter wardrobe,\" Tom said. \"I'm Tom. I fix things.\"\n\n\"Jay,\" the boy offered after an appraisal that lasted a beat longer than comfort. \"I make them worse and then prettier. The council hates me in the abstract and uses my photos to look current. It's all right. Everyone has to be a hypocrite somewhere.\"\n\n\"You want to paint scenery that won't wash off in the rain?\" Tom asked, surprising them both with the speed of the offer. \"Year 2's got space left in its galaxy, and my donkey is holding out for his close-up.\"\n\nJay's mouth did something that might have been almost a smile before he remembered himself and stole the expression back. \"Yeah. Maybe. Paper lies beautifully if you treat it right. I could make your stars for you. And your planets. Proper rings, not those stupid hula-hoops people do.\"\n\n\"Done,\" Tom said, as if he had just signed a treaty that would bring peace to a corridor.\n\nThe trust wrote to say that the review would be in twelve months and that the phrase flexible deployment would acquire a working definition, which is the kind of future that doesn't fit nicely into a mind. Tom printed the email because he wanted to hold it in his hands and feel its unhelpfulness. He folded it and unfolded it and put it under the strawberry magnet, then took it down because the magnet made it look like something you keep on a fridge to keep hope fresh. He wrote instead on a card the sentence Nina had given him to memorise and kept forgetting: There will be another day to fight, and perhaps a better one. He placed that under the magnet and found the strawberry's frivolity reassuring.\n\nThe weather pivoted in a way that had not been announced in any forecast Mr Dray had played for him. Rain practiced for two days and then turned up to see what it could get away with. The river swelled and walked itself up the banks like a visitor who had found the spare key. The school whispered about sandbags, the way people whisper about old flames, half disapproving and half eager for the drama. Tom spent a morning in the caretaker\u2019s cupboard making piles make sense, putting torches with batteries and batteries with their right friends, checking that the mop heads were not planning mutiny. He took delivery of three dozen grey sacks with a willingness that startled the man who had to carry them and wrote sand with a marker on them in letters that were too neat.\n\nIt began with a trickle in the playground where the drain had never quite learned its lesson. It continued with a suggestion of damp where the Year 1 corridor joined the cloakroom, and then the suggestion became declarative. At eleven, a teacher whose calm had been made in a forge knocked on the cupboard door and told him that the river had decided to make an appearance by the back gate. He stepped outside into air that had gone greenish with worry and saw the water testing the school like a burglar checks windows. He called the council with the efficient despair of someone who had called them before and then he called Gary because if you wanted something turned into a temporary solution with a lifespan of six hours and a story to dine out on, you called Gary.\n\nBy noon the world smelled of wet cardboard and effort. He and two TAs who had known him long enough to mimic his jokes built a low defence that looked like ambition and hope had been translated into grey. The children ate lunch in classrooms because the hall was flirting with puddles, and there was a hum in the building that was not singing and not panic but a third thing that coordinates bodies without arguing with hearts. Kira arrived with a flask the size of a small moon and six cups that had once been mismatched and were now, through use, a set. Gary brought a dehumidifier on a dolly and swore that he had bartered it for a bag of 10p pieces and a favour owed from a man who had no name, which meant he had bought it in cash from a man named Stuart. Mrs Penney moved along the corridors with her hands in her pockets the way a general keeps his behind his back, seeing the whole.\n\nAt one, the water asked for more and the sky gave it. The back classrooms looked out on a new pond and the sound altered in a way that made everyone 5% more aware of their knees. Tom lifted chairs like he was rescuing cats and thought not at all about what would happen if water decided to be a tenant. He spoke to doors and meant it; Keep this line, he said to one that had always fancied itself a leader. Be the hero you were made to be, he said to another that squeaked when nervous. He didn't sing because singing tears the membrane that keeps calm intact and he needed that membrane today, but he hummed a line that had nothing to do with rivers and everything to do with not dropping things. Jay turned up in a hoodie that had aspirations and calm on his face, looked at the river, and shrugged in an appraising way. \"I can get pallets,\" he said. \"From behind Aldi. They owe me for art. I\u2019ll build you a catwalk.\"\n\nThey built a catwalk, because of course they did, and for an hour the school walked on wood and felt like a ship remembering itself. In Year 3, a child decided to test physics by crying loudly enough to cause weather, and Tom sat on a low chair and explained that rain was not personal and that sometimes water needed to see other places and would return, and the child doubted him correctly and then put her head on his knee as if she had chosen to trust the chair instead. When, at two, the headteacher from across town rang to see how they were managing, Mrs Penney stood in the office and said words that would reassure a person who needed to be told that the world could still be organised, and Tom watched her and felt a surge of admiration for a woman who could tell reality how to behave respectfully.\n\nThe water stopped where it was supposed to stop. It considered an inch, had the grace to think about it, and then held. The day lengthened in the particular way days do when they have been asked to hold a little too much. Parents came early and later, depending on the river and the buses, and the school became a cloakroom for anxieties and umbrellas. Tom lifted children over the last mind of water and made a joke about pirates until it became boring and then stopped because there is nothing more infuriating than a person who continues to be funny after the joke has retired. At three-thirty, when the bell sounded like it was working for its living, the corridor hum happened again, unbidden, in the place where the floor had dried and the light made a rectangle on the tiles. He stood in it with his key ring heavy in his hand and didn't sing because it would have been theatre, and instead he checked the sandbags with the gravity of a man who has invented a new hobby.\n\nWhen the last child had been claimed and the last teacher had sighed in relief and guilt, they sat in the staffroom with tea and the high of getting away with something. Gary discovered biscuits somewhere and rationed them with cruel wisdom. Kira took off her eyeliner with a tissue like a flag of surrender and tucked her feet under her as if she had been born to that sofa. Jay hovered near the door and pretended to look at his phone and then sat because nobody told him not to. Mrs Penney said thank you without frill and without calling it anything else, which made the thank you weigh the right amount. Tom looked at his hands and found them river-dirty and good for nothing except more useful things, and he felt tired in the way men feel tired when they have done the thing they can do and kept something from breaking that didn't have to break that day.\n\nThat night the Medway sulked and then pretended it had never had ideas above its station. The world outside the bedsit smelled of clean-up, that particular odour of defeat and victory mixed. Tom washed his hands for longer than necessary and the water seemed to forgive him for having sworn at it earlier. He knocked on Mr Dray's door out of habit born of the day's edges, and the older man opened wearing the cardigan that had had to learn his shape. They listened to the forecast together without speaking because sometimes you borrow another man's habit to put your own away. Cody, Fitzroy, Biscay, German Bight, the names came, more confident and less wet than they had any right to be given the evidence outside. When it was done, Mr Dray coughed with dignity and pointed his chin at the wall. \"Never trust a low that calls itself manageable,\" he said, and Tom laughed with such relief he worried he would cry.\n\nJay turned up the next day with a roll of paper that had been saved from a bonfire and an authority over tape that would have impressed the council. He had brought two friends who behaved like apprentices in a guild they didn't know they'd joined. They filled the stage with a galaxy that wasn't real but could be believed by anyone who looked up tired after a day of adding and subtracting. Jay worked fast, the kind of fast that comes from not planning and having planned secretly for months, and he let Tom cut stars while making conversation an optional extra. At the end, when the donkey-ship rolled out through a field of perfect planets, Jay made a sound that could have been approval and photographed it like he was stealing a moment to sell later to himself in a poorer mood.\n\n\"You do singing,\" he said then, as if the information had been presented and verified by a third party. \"I don't sing. I draw loud, though.\"\n\n\"You drew us a sky,\" Tom said. \"Always handy for a song.\"\n\n\"You're weird,\" Jay said, with accuracy and something like fondness, then tightened the tape on a corner and disappeared in the way teenagers can when the room thinks it has more time to say the right thing.\n\nThe Wednesday singing club doubled because children have a nose for good rooms. It was still only twelve, but it felt like a choir if you squinted and believed. They stood among the vaulting poles and the crash mats and made a sound that understood the space. Tom printed out lyrics with a font that refused to apologise and introduced a new song because a club needs to believe it can produce novelty or it will lose momentum like a bike that has decided to become a chair. He had written it in his head while counting sandbags because that was when the mind agreed to multitask, and it was about hinges, because of course it was, and about doors that know your name and about the particular mercy of a corridor that curves and still gets you somewhere. The children laughed when the door got a line, and then they sang it carefully because laughing and careful often travel together in the young.\n\nHe wrote to Marianne when the rain had given up, because the television people had begun their sniffing for feel-good, and told her about the river and the sandbags and the pallets from behind Aldi and the catwalk and the hum, and suggested gently that if the region liked people who were part of their places, perhaps their cameras could point at the people who had done the saving with their quieter hands. Marianne phoned the next day, sounding as if she had enjoyed putting something obvious over a small flame for just long enough to call it cooking. She said she wanted to send a crew to film the singing club and the painted stars, and he said all right, but that the club was not television-friendly in the way shows like; it was full of small pauses and jokes that require context and biscuits. She laughed and said biscuits are universally legible and promised no staged humming. He believed her because she knew what he meant about the light making people think the wrong things were important.\n\nThe hospice wrote on paper with a logo that had flowers that managed to be sincere, and asked whether, at the Christmas fair, he would sing while the raffle destroyed the flow of time, because people are gentler with their money when there are carols. He had a complicated relationship with carols because they were songs he had learned at an age when he thought songs came with rules for being a person and things had deteriorated afterwards, but he said yes because the corridors there had held him up when he leaned, and because he wanted to be the kind of man who sang between mince pies and a secondhand jigsaw. He told Nina, who told him not to be manipulated by anyone with tinsel, and then said she would come and wear a jumper that could light a village.\n\nNovember brought a cold that didn't announce itself with sneezing so much as with the increasing unwillingness of batteries. The hall lights took half a second longer to remember their brilliance, and the photocopier, which was powered by demons and acronyms, demanded sacrifice. Tom oiled and buffed and tightened and discovered a new squeak in the Year 2 cupboard that sounded like a toy horse confessing, and he found himself liking it because it was a noise he could solve. He bought plasters with cartoons on for a child who had become fascinated by the edges of doors and the consequences of distraction. He taped up a poster for the Christmas fete that had been designed by someone enthusiastic about clip art and considered writing 'and music' under 'mulled wine' with a pen, then decided that smugness is often the enemy of community and let the poster be.\n\nHe went to Gravesend two Sundays in a row because Nina needed him to build a shelf and because she had a cackle that improved roast potatoes. Roland came round with an armful of records and a suggestion that Tom come back on the radio to talk about songs people share at funerals, which was either ghoulish or practical and possibly both. Tom agreed because it would mean saying out loud things that people say to him in corridors and bringing them into a room where everyone could pretend to be alone together. He helped Nina put the shelf up and pretended to know how to use a spirit level with more confidence than he had, and when it was done she looked at it and declared it useful and then hugged him in the manner of a person who is fixing something that cannot be fixed but wants to mark attendance.\n\nThe day the television crew came back for their small where-are-they-now, the school smelled of glitter glue and new cardigans. The producer with the ponytail turned up with ginger biscuits which meant she had been promoted by a minor god. They filmed the club from a respectable distance and caught Keir making a beat under The Water Is Wide that was inappropriate and perfect, and they recorded Jay painting a small comet on a corner nobody would film properly, and no one told him not to because the law of classrooms is that a boy with paint can be contained by kindness more efficiently than by rules. Marianne asked if Tom would sing a bit to camera and he said he would hum if the room did, and then the room hummed and the camera looked pleased because it had caught an accident behaving itself.\n\nIt was in the middle of that humming that the trust woman arrived again, smelling of compromise and good handbags. She stood in the doorway and watched for ten seconds longer than was necessary and then caught herself and began speaking in bullet points. The review had been pushed to spring because budgets had decided to become pumpkins at midnight and the trust wanted to see how winter was going to treat the pipes, she said, turning even water into an agenda item. She spoke about estates strategy and the need to develop talent across sites, and he heard the irony and decided to step into it.\n\n\"Let me teach caretakers how to listen to buildings,\" he said, surprising himself with the audacity of suggesting anything that wasn't defensive. \"Let me run a morning somewhere with a room of people with mops and give them a list of tricks that aren't on the spreadsheet. How to make a door behave without breaking its pride. How to speak to radiators in a language they respect. How to get chalk off walls without making the wall give up. How to be part of a school without being swallowed.\"\n\nShe blinked because it is not every day a man with glue on his cuffs presents you with a curriculum. \"We don't have budget for training,\" she began, by reflex, and then stopped because there was a camera capturing a humming that might make donors feel generous at breakfast. \"But we do have staff conference day in February. I'll put you on, if you send me a title that makes it sound like we meant it all along.\"\n\n\"Care of Fabric,\" he said immediately, because he'd been giving his sessions the names he wished buildings had. \"Fabric meaning cloth and thread and bodies. Fabric meaning walls and doors. Care meaning both. I'll bring biscuits. No PowerPoint. Just hands.\"\n\nShe laughed despite the part of her that wanted to be immune to charm and wrote it down, and later he would tell Gary that the first lesson in advocacy is to wait until a person is standing near a camera and then suggest a thing that sounds like you've only just thought of it even if you've been rehearsing for days.\n\nDecember found him at the hospice with a song list that he had made the way you make tea for unexpected company. He sang carols without making them fancy because some songs don't appreciate your embroidery. He did Once in Royal not because he had loved it as a child but because his mother had sung the alto line over the top by accident, and because he liked the way the third verse let you breathe. He sang The Parting Glass because a woman with a hat that had seen war asked for it and because the room had needed a song that didn't square its shoulders. He sang the hinge song because a child had gravitated toward the keyboard and hit middle C with dogged devotion, and the hum happened in the corridor without him asking and he watched the nurse with the forget-me-not touch her wrist as if the flower had warmed. Nina wore a jumper with a reindeer that blinked and shouted at him in whispers when he had almost cried near the raffle table, which is what you pay sisters for.\n\nBack at St. Pilgrim\u2019s, the Christmas production arrived like a bus that had been expected at four and rolled in at half past five with apologies and a horn. There were shepherds with attitudes and angels with hair decisions and a donkey whose ship had learned to turn left if coaxed in a voice that promised biscuits later. Jay's stars glittered under lights they had not been designed for and got away with it. The singing club stood at the side and discovered a new talent for being ready and then waiting, and Tom stood behind the curtain and held his breath while the Year 2 narrator declared that space was like a porridge you had to stir with a rocket and was pummelled gently by three grandmothers who could not cope with the logic. The audience clapped in the right places and laughed in the wrong places and loved everything because everything had been made by hands they recognised. After, in the hall, Tom mopped glitter with a resignation that had learnt to be fond, and told the door that had been the hero that it had performed beyond specifications and would be thanked appropriately with oil in January.\n\nThat night, upstairs, Mr Dray produced from a drawer a Morse key that had been kept alive by tea and habit. He placed it on the table with a reverence that made the lamp stand still. \"I can't use it anymore without dragging ghosts up with it,\" he said, flatly and without pleading, \"but it ought to be used or it will sulk, and sulky instruments haunt houses. Learn it. Or take it to your club and let them pretend to be ships at sea. Teach them what a dot feels like. Teach them how to ask for help with a finger.\"\n\nTom took it the way you take a small animal someone trusts you with and found that holding it made his back straighten. He tapped once, twice, idiotically, and Mr Dray made a face that a better friend would have anticipated and softened. He showed him the rhythm for S and O with a patience that made the table like him more. They sat and tapped, and the room became a room where other men had sat and tapped and hoped for ears, and Tom thought about rhythm as a kind of watching that makes sound behave.\n\nThe singing club learned Morse in the way children learn anything under the guise of drama. They sent messages across the crash mats with their fingers like spies whose passwords are biscuits, and Tom didn't tell them that one day they might need to tell a room they were not all right without frightening their own voices, because that was not a thing you teach in a gym store. He asked Jay to paint them a simple code on the back of a piece of scenery, and Jay wrote dots and dashes with the precision of a man who enjoyed systems but only in private and only if they could be defaced later for art. Keir, who had been born with a rhythm machine where other boys store their disinclination to tidy, tapped a backbeat under SOS and then had the grace to stop when Amara gave him a look that could cut wire.\n\nTwo days before term ended, the trust sent round a flyer for the staff conference day in February with a schedule that had been assembled by a person who believed in verbs. Care of Fabric sat at eleven o'clock in a font that did not apologise for itself next to sessions on trauma-informed pedagogy and teaching maths through dance, which made Tom both proud and anxious for the world. Nina rang to say that she had found a secondhand suit for a tenner and would be bringing it down because you ought to have something that makes you walk differently for days like that, and he told her he would consider his walking and she told him he had better consider it out loud where she could hear. Kira threatened to stand at the back with a placard that read HE'S FUNNY REALLY and Gary offered to heckle with love and then, unexpectedly, told him he wasn't allowed to fail because he'd already bought a notebook for the quotes.\n\nOn the last morning before the holidays, he arrived at St. Pilgrim\u2019s to find a note in the pigeonhole that had not come through the usual channels. It was folded over neatly and had his name in pencil in a hand that made its letters sit up straight. Inside there was a drawing of the corridor rectangle of light and a cartwheel that somebody had smudged with a thumb, and underneath, in their new careful writing, the words Thank you for the hum. It was not signed because sometimes thank yous don't need to be attached to a throat to be true. He stood in the cupboard and held it and thought about the part of his job that would never go on a spreadsheet and never make it into a policy and never be used as evidence when the trust brought its forms to town, and he thought about the day in February when he would be allowed to tell other caretakers to listen to walls, and he felt a closeness to himself that was not vanity but something that resembled fidelity.\n\nThe mural had changed again, because the wall never allowed itself boredom. WHO CLEANS UP THE STARS had acquired an answer written in a different hand: WE DO, WITH OUR COATS ON. It made him laugh in the street in a way that made two older ladies turn and approve. He reached out and touched the edge of the chalk R with one finger as if checking if a cake was done and then thought about telling Jay and decided not to because some compliments were better overheard than delivered. He went into The Oast House because Kira had told him there would be sausage rolls only fit for men who had faced rivers, and found her and Gary and two TA's and a parent governor and the postman and a child who had won a raffle prize he couldn't carry, and for half an hour he sat and let other people talk while he ate, and the grindcore of the coffee machine tried to fight the hum of the room and failed because this was a place that had been taught by use how to hold sound without bruising.\n\nIn his bedsit that night he laid the Morse key on the table next to the feather and the plaque and the strawberry magnet's stubborn cutesiness, and the arrangement looked like a museum of a person who had found uses for both the beautiful and the blunt. He tapped S, O, S like a man checking whether a song worked upside down, and then he tapped, tentatively, OK in the code he had been taught by a man who had made himself into radio, and there was a sense in the room that something had answered. He laughed at himself and put the key away in a drawer with a reverence that was only half pretending, and then he lay on his bed and looked at Norway and thought about flood water and the sound children's humming had made in the corridor and the way sandbags can persuade a river to consider its options, and he slept because it had been earned.\n\nChristmas did its capable thing and moved on, leaving behind oranges with redundant cloves and strings of lights that had become discussions. January walked in with its hands in its pockets and the wrong shoes, and the school returned with a cheer that was at once real and minimal. He stood at the doors on the first day back and told them they were beautiful, because he had promised himself to do it on days when it was not obvious. The hinges responded with a confidence he chose to attribute to compliments rather than new oil, and the hall, when he switched on the lights, chose to cooperate without drama. In the gym store, the crash mats waited with the stoicism of soldiers, and he felt sudden gratitude for things that keep their shape when asked to more than usual.\n\nOn the second Wednesday of term he brought the Morse key to the club and told them they were going to learn to say hello and I'm here and can you hear me and sorry, not yet, and somebody asked if there was a code for biscuit and he told them he'd invent one. They tapped and giggled and tapped like people inventing a language that adults would feel left out of, and he found himself thinking that if he had been given this small instrument at nine he might have stayed in certain rooms longer, or at least not blamed them for failing to notice he was in them. He glanced at the doorway and found Jay leaning there, pretending to look for attention and finding it, and asked if he'd paint them a code to keep, and Jay nodded as if asked to memorialise something the council would never read.\n\nWhen he walked home that night the river behaved itself and the air had given up on being dramatic. He paused on the bridge because he didn't like letting days turn into other days without consent, and watched the water look like a difficult essay that had finally been handed in. He thought about February and the staff conference and about the trust's careful vocabulary and about the boy in Year 3 who had lost a tooth in assembly and held it up like a white flag and about a woman at the hospice who had sung three words with him and then stopped because that had been exactly enough. He thought about what he could tell other caretakers that would not feel like showing off and would not be a waste of their tea, and it occurred to him quite calmly that he had a thing somebody else might need. He held the thought as if it were a bolt he intended to put down somewhere safe, and then he went home and told the doors goodnight, and the doors said nothing, and he trusted them.",

The grey light threw up low shimmers from the Medway, and the swans looked like badly folded napkins dotted along the water. On Quarry Hill Road, the shop shutters shivered awake. One by one: a fishmonger with a fractured green sign, the charity shop that smelt of lavender and dust and bright wool, the carpet place with the display rolled up like the tongues of dragon dogs. On the corner, a half-dead tree scratched a page of sky. You could almost smell toast, if you wanted it enough.\n\nTom Merriweather walked to work with a key ring like a small planet orbiting his palm. He was thirty-eight and had a face people said was trustworthy when they'd lost something. He had shoulders that sloped like he'd grown used to carrying poles, planks, ladders, children who'd fallen, guilt about leaks. He worked at St. Pilgrim\u2019s Primary, a practical building that never decided if it wanted to be hopeful or petty, and after ten years he could listen to the walls and know which was about to peel.\n\nHe talked to the doors. \"Morning, you.\" The doors never answered, but responded in a way, the way a door does: swinging more easily for people who wag fair words at them.\n\nThe custodian's cupboard smelt of mop and medicinal soap and yesterday. He clicked the light, listened to the whirr of the fixture warming up\u2014half a second, then the blossom of humming. It sounded, in his better moods, like the beginning of a song. He sang to himself because it made the mops dance and the broom handles softened their hard stares. He had a voice that, to him, seemed to enter a room half a beat before he did.\n\nIt was an old song he favoured this morning, something his mum used to hum while shelling peas\u2014Molly Malone, poor girl, or the one about a river that was never the same river twice. He liked the way the vowels lifted like kites and then went slack on their strings. He liked imagining that they could fly to a place where he fit. He ran the mop along the assembly hall like a man sweeping a stage, paused to look at his own reflection in the polished wood and saw one of those faces that can't keep still. He hit a note at the ceiling and held it longer than the light held its breath.\n\n\"Again?\" Mrs Penney said from the doorway. She was somewhere between stern and soft, and wore shoes that knew where they wanted to go.\n\nTom straightened, the mop head dangling. \"Keeps the acoustics exercised.\" He tried a joke like he always did.\n\nShe smiled with only two thirds of her mouth. \"The sound system keeps the acoustics exercised. You've the caretaker's cupboard today. Leaking bleach. And the Year 2 play equipment hasn't come, so be a magician.\"\n\nHe pulled the mop upright like a soldier. \"Righto, righto. You want me to build a donkey or a spaceship?\"\n\n\"Both. It\u2019s Goldilocks in space this year. Budget cuts. And\u2014\" She hesitated, turned, decided against whatever she was about to say, then decided for it. \"Keep the singing for after three, will you? They're doing tests. And you know some of them complain.\"\n\n\"Who complains?\"\n\n\"Parents. Mostly. The children like you. Or they like the idea of you.\" She left on that odd note, and Tom felt an old bruise of embarrassment bloom at his collar.\n\n\"You can't shush a river,\" he murmured. He did not sing again, which was not the same thing as stopping.\n\nHe liked the little jobs that nobody noticed. There was a satisfaction in the quiet heroism of a hinge that no longer squeaked. He took the box of screws from the toolbox, lifting handfuls like pistachios, cupping each tiny head between finger and thumb and turning, turning, until it bit and held. He was good at turning until things held. He was less good at knowing when to stop.\n\nAt break, a group of boys gathered by the back step and watched him wind the hose onto its reel. The newest one, a small boy with a forehead like a cliff, asked, \"Sir, why do your eyes sing when your mouth does?\" Which was nonsense strictly speaking, but true in a way Tom liked more.\n\n\"You hear with more than your ears,\" Tom said. \"Watches can hear time pass you know.\"\n\n\"That's just ticking,\" said a sensible boy with a tight mouth.\n\n\"Ticking is sighing for machines.\" Tom winked and the small cliff nodded as if he'd deciphered something.\n\nThey asked him to sing. He shook his head toward the staffroom window, where a silhouette moved dangerously like a teacher with opinions, and he sang anyway, but quietly. \"When I was one-and-twenty...\" The boys leaned in, mown-grass smell, scabby knees, a chorus of the bored and the fervent. Halfway through, the sensible boy giggled and then they all did, a ripple moving through them like a fish. Tom smiled and finished the verse. After they ran away, he looked up to see his own reflection in the staffroom window, mouth open, eyes partly closed. It wasn't pretty. He decided it looked serious.\n\nHis phone vibrated like an insect in his pocket at lunch. He ate in the little cafe beyond the station some days, but more often he went to The Oast House, which had learned his name without asking. Kira, who worked the noon shift and wore eyeliner as if it were armour, poured him a pint of lemonade without asking, and placed it in front of him like a truce.\n\n\"You singing tonight, Tom?\" she asked. She was used to the question stealing the lift from her eyebrows when she saw the way he lit.\n\n\"Not formally,\" he said. \"But I will if conjured. I'm thinking of\u2014\"\n\n\"Please don't say My Way.\"\n\n\"\u2014My Way.\" He grinned at her as if he had done something clever.\n\n\"You know the contest?\" Kira nodded at a poster pinned near the back door, where it would attract exactly as much attention as a notice about a missing cat. SOUTH EAST SONG QUEST, it read, a star and musical notes climbing a ladder. Heat from the kitchen had curled one corner. The paper looked as though it was tired of making promises.\n\nTom's eyes landed like magpies. \"Is that\u2014\" He got up too quickly and his lemonade sloshed.\n\n\"That's old,\" Kira said over the clink of plates. \"Came last year, I think. The bloke never collected the posters. They do a new one every spring. You can go to Tunbridge Wells and stand in a queue and two minutes later they'll tell you what you've got. Or not. It was funny last time. There was a man did Blackbird who sounded like one.\"\n\n\"Blackbird's easy to confuse,\" Tom said gravely, closer to the paper than any grown man should need to be. The print had been smudged so the dates smudged with it. A tear-off strip had only one ragged number left: 0777something, the rest lost to time or teenagers.\n\n\"There's more online,\" Kira said. \"It's always online.\"\n\n\"I don't have the online.\" He said it lightly, in case it was a confession.\n\n\"You don't have the online?\" She laughed the way she did, an unexpected delighted sound like dice in a cup. \"You don't have a phone?\"\n\n\"I have a phone. It's a phone that phones. It's... a talking machine.\"\n\n\"Eyes to floor, Granddads,\" she teased. \"Well, maybe you get a leaflet from the library. Or ask Gary. Gary has everything. He's a mole with Wi-Fi.\"\n\n\"I'll ask Gary,\" he said, pocketing the poster tab, though it lacked the piece a person would need. He liked the feel of torn paper. He liked talismans.\n\nHe ate his shepherd's pie in a daze, counted out the coins, and left a chip in neat halves, because leaving a whole would be wasteful, and eating it would be greed. Outside, the afternoon air had taken on that peculiar crispness that happens when a coastal wind gets lost inland. He used the back lane, because it was quicker and because it had a mural that changed every few months, messages painted over messages, an archaeology of spray paint. Today it said YOU ARE GOLD in letters that slumped at the edges. He imagined the mural talking to him when he couldn't sleep. He tried not to imagine the mural telling him something truer: you are brass, you are tin, you are not the thing you think.\n\nWhen he finished the day, he took the long way home for no reason other than that he wanted to pass the old cinema. He liked the names on the marquee even when they were for films he would never watch. He liked that wishes could be lit, letter by letter, even if they spelt out nothing you\u2019d recognise later. He lived in a bedsit above Finnerty Carpets, with a stovetop that made a sound like a throat clearing when it was ready, and a window that didn't face anywhere useful.\n\nHis upstairs neighbour was Mr Dray, who coughed through the floorboards and played the shipping forecast for comfort, low but relentless. If Tom put his ear to the skirting he could hear the shape of it, the hush and swell of weather where he had never been. Sometimes he hummed along. It didn't fit, and that was the point.\n\nThe walls were thin enough that you could borrow things from your neighbour without asking, like heat or the scent of burned jam. Tonight he borrowed a sliver of cricket commentary and the smell from Finnerty's of new carpet: plastic and glue and hope that this would be the one that didn't stain. He boiled spaghetti until it surrendered. He wrote his name on a post-it note, because it amused him to imagine a policeman holding it up to his face in a future where he had forgotten. He placed the note on the fridge and looked at it for a while, noticing how the letters hunched like people in a bus shelter.\n\nHe tried the number on the poster tab even though it wasn't complete, because he believed in mercy. He dialed 0777 and then the ghost of digits, his thumb hovering over blankness as if he could fill it with wanting. The tone told him to stop being foolish. He laughed at himself and didn't feel silly at all, which is a little worrying if you look at it too hard.\n\nHe went downstairs, locking the carpet shop on the way with the key Finnerty had given him for emergencies. Finnerty said he had a face like someone who wouldn't steal, which was both an insult and an honour. The evening had a bruise in it now. He walked along the High Street and turned into the coin laundrette with its neon that made everyone look a little dead. Gary ran the place, sort of. He sat behind the counter with a flat cap and a flat expression and eyes like a caravan site: all of it temporary.\n\n\"You look like someone who needs to know the internet,\" Gary said by way of greeting. \"Or a stiff drink. I can only help with one legally.\"\n\n\"Do you know South East Song Quest?\" Tom asked, and it pleased him that the name made a pattern in his mouth. ACK. ST. Q. You could sing those letters.\n\n\"I know everything that has a forum,\" Gary said. \"And I've had the misfortune of reading one about that. Why?\"\n\n\"I want to enter,\" Tom said, which felt like pushing open a door and finding a meadow or a cliff, and then finding out it was a mirror.\n\nGary typed with two fingers and a solemnity that made the task seem holy. The screen lit his face from below and stole his age. He made noises at the screen, low key exasperations. \"All right. There's heats all over Kent. You go and you do your party piece and then people get angry in the comments. Final's at the Assembly Hall in Tunbridge Wells like always. They moved one to Maidstone once and no one stopped going on about it. There's an email address. There's a phone number, but you don't ring it because you'll get a person who needs to be rebooted.\"\n\n\"I'd like to skip the queue,\" Tom said, as if saying it might make it true. \"I'm not really a queuer. I\u2019m a late-comer-and-then-anointed sort.\"\n\nGary snorted. \"You'll want the wildcard. They do a 'community hero' thing. The kind of person who helps old people with their bags and rescues dogs and then everyone claps regardless of whether he can hold a tune.\"\n\nTom looked appropriately saintly. \"I rescue chairs. Does that count?\"\n\n\"Depends on the chair.\" Gary handed him a pad and a pencil. \"Write down your full name, your real one not the one you give girls at the pub, and your mobile and your email and I'll pretend to be you for five minutes and send them your sob story.\"\n\n\"I haven't a sob story,\" Tom said quickly. There was too much of one to choose from. It wouldn't sort itself in a paragraph. And it wasn't quite sob, besides. It was something with a different weather system.\n\n\"Fine. We'll call you The Singing Caretaker and make up the rest. People love a title. Like The Laughing Plumber and The Psychic Fishmonger. We will say... you repair things. And sing.\"\n\n\"I do repair things,\" Tom said.\n\nGary wrote. He typed. He clicked. He sucked his teeth like a mechanic negotiating a stubborn part. \"Done. They'll either ignore me, or they'll be in a bind and they'll pounce on you because a caretaker is human enough to project decency onto. You'll get your moment. Could be fun. Or a catastrophe, which is also fun.\"\n\n\"Did you ever sing?\" Tom asked, because he couldn't imagine Gary being younger than granite.\n\n\"I was in a ska band for six weeks,\" Gary said, straight-faced. \"We were called skA+ which seemed clever at the time. It's not a talent thing. Crowd decides if you're allowed or not. Most of the time you learn your people are mean. Still want to do it?\"\n\n\"More than the other things,\" Tom said, which was true.\n\nHe went to bed astonished that he'd done something. The bedsit had that brittle quiet of single-occupancy places, soft objects arranged to look like they weren't assigned to one pair of hands. He lay on his back and thought about lights. The kind that make a tunnel out of the world and put you inside it. He had been under those lights once\u2014well, twice. The first time was Year Six Play, a scandal of paper crowns and cellophane stars. He was an angel then, a sacred mistake in wings made of net curtaining, and the light made him feel as if somebody had finally seen the shape of him. The second time was when his mum went. The hospital lights made everything look like a coin you found in a gutter. He stored both experiences in the same cupboard of his brain that he couldn't bear to open or to forget.\n\nHe woke before his alarm, because his body didn't trust clocks. He shaved with a razor that had lost interest. He sang to the mirror and believed he improved marginally around the lower notes. He ate toast and put jam on it with discipline. On the way out, he ran his hand along the banister, which, despite appearances, had one loose nail that gave a secret thrill like a hinge with a plan. He told Mr Dray's door, \"Good luck today\" because he believed in inter-apartment relations like that. He was answered with a cough that could have been agreement or despair.\n\nBack at St. Pilgrim's, he found the noticeboard disorganised in a way that made you want to blow at it and watch the papers reorder themselves like flocking birds. He took the pins out of one corner at a time, sighed each sheet into place, tacked them back with care. It made the day gentler, knowing something in the world had been sorted. He fixed a radiator that had decided to impersonate a glacier. He re-grouted a bit of the Year 3 boys' loos with a patience that would shame saints. He fetched a box of cardboard shapes and elastic bands from the storage cupboard and turned it into a twentieth-century spaceship with a donkey's head. The children saw it at lunchtime and yelped as if he had conjured a dog.\n\nHe was wiping glue from his hands with the ease of habit when his phone made that uncertain sound it made when it received a message. It was the sound of a small thing dropping into a bigger thing. Unknown number. He opened it as one opens a fortune cookie, with equal parts hope and amusement. Please call re: South East Song Quest. It had numbers in the message, complete and not smudged at all.\n\nHe felt a hot thing move up his spine. A tingle at the base of the skull that people talk about like it's magic. He stepped into the cleaner's cupboard because he wanted walls around him when he rang. The smell of bleach and almond made his eyes water. He dialed and he waited and the line picked up with a recorded voice that told him he was important and then a real voice that sounded like someone with a smile that had been stapled to her face.\n\n\"Hello, South East Song Quest. You've reached Marianne.\"\n\n\"Hello, Marianne. I am... I'm Tom. I sent you an email. I mean a friend did. I'm the caretaker. He is. We are the caretaker. Are. Am.\"\n\n\"Lovely,\" Marianne said, proof that you can say nothing and still sound like you're in charge. \"Yes, so, we've looked at your application. We don't normally\u2014well, this is unusual\u2014\" She laughed, a professional laugh. \"We have a wildcard final slot for a community champion this year. One of our finalists had to pull out. If you could attend the final, next month, we would love to have you. We've had a look at your profile, and it's really touching. 'You fix the world while humming.'\"\n\n\"Gary,\" Tom said softly, because there was such a thing as a friend who could choose better words than you could when you needed them.\n\n\"Sorry?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said brightly to cover it. \"Yes. Yes. The final.\"\n\n\"We'll sort your song choice nearer the time. You can't do My Way, I'm afraid. Or Hallelujah. Legal reasons mostly. And we might do a small film about you in your day-to-day if that's all right. Nothing intrusive.\"\n\n\"I can do not-My-Way,\" Tom said, feeling delightful. He thought of the boys by the steps. Perhaps they'd be proud.\n\n\"We'll send you a pack. There will be forms. It's not glamorous. But the stage is.\"\n\n\"I know.\" The words came out like a prayer you'd say in a church you'd wandered into because of weather.\n\nMarianne rattled off details: dates he would forget immediately, times he wrote on his palm with a Bic that read only on the third attempt, what to wear and what not to, where to stand and what not to say to sponsors. He said yes too many times. He hung up and put his head against the door and laughed, a small neat laugh that could turn mean if you took away the air.\n\nHe went back to the hall dazed, to find Mrs Penney adjusting a microphone stand. \"You look like someone who has swallowed a helium balloon,\" she said.\n\n\"I have... news.\" He wasn't good at saying big things like they were small things. He was either too loud or too careful.\n\nMrs Penney put her hands into her pockets, the signal of a woman who is about to weigh. \"Is it news I want to know, or a morale hazard?\"\n\n\"I've been invited to the final of a singing contest. The last\u2014well, the last bit. In Tunbridge Wells. I'll be on... a stage.\"\n\n\"You'll be on a stage,\" she repeated, her tone revealing nothing. Then she gave him a little smile, the kind she kept for children who'd made something recognisable out of glue. \"Well then. We'll put up a notice for you in the staffroom. 'Big Tom. Small Stage.' No. 'Stage Tom, Thin Ice.'\"\n\n\"Don't be horrid,\" he said, and then a pity came over her face like a veil and she reached out and patted the back of his hand, once, quick, as if that made a difference to the shape of any of it. She didn't say the thing she could have said, which was either kind or lazy.\n\nWord got around because words fly better than birds. The Year 5 girls wore expressions of sarcasm that had been pinned to their faces by older sisters. A TA called Sandra told him she was \"dead proud if it's on the level.\" Gary sent a text with three thumbs up and a skull, which counted as serious endorsement. Kira wrote on a napkin, which she handed him ceremonially when he came in for his lemonade: You're going to smash it! She drew a microphone that looked like a lollipop. He folded the napkin and put it in his wallet like a prayer card.\n\nHe phoned his sister because he didn't want to. Nina lived in Gravesend and could not imagine living anywhere smaller than London or bigger than a lap. She was what people call capable like it's a compliment and an accusation both.\n\n\"You what,\" she said after he had told her. It wasn't a question so much as a scalpel.\n\n\"They have a thing for a community champion,\" he explained, loving how noble that sounded. \"For someone who works with\u2014\"\n\n\"You mop floors, Tom,\" she said. \"I mean. Yes. It's good. It's honest. But don't let them do a thing on you like you're Mother Teresa with a squeegee. People like to laugh. At you, which you know, or at the story. Promise me you don't sign anything without\u2014\"\n\n\"They're not out to hurt me,\" he said, hearing the child's turn in his voice. \"It's a nice thing. I'm being... included. I haven't been... included. Not like this.\"\n\nShe was quiet long enough for him to know she was choosing between being the sister who cares and the sister who wins. \"Okay,\" she said eventually. \"I will come. If you want me. Or I won't, if that makes it easier. Either way, I'm here, which is ridiculous because I am there, but I'm here.\"\n\n\"Come,\" he said, suddenly, wanting her in a seat if only to have someone to look up at who would remind him he didn't come from nowhere. \"Wear something that doesn't rustle.\"\n\n\"You're absurd,\" she said, and he felt like someone had draped a blanket over a chair and called it a tent.\n\nThe days changed their shape. The school stayed itself, stubborn, a river that would not be told what to do by a man with a bucket. But around it, everything in him sharpened. He began to rehearse without permission. He sang in the hall when empty, and in the cleaner's cupboard with the light off, and in the echoing cavity of the gym store where netballs nested. He found a song in his throat that he didn't know he had: something old, almost liturgical, that had a place for a trembling voice. He hummed in the corridor and the children hummed back, unaware of what they were doing: being accomplices.\n\nAt the pub, Kira tried to give him a shot of something that tasted like burnt oranges. He sipped and winced and said it was good with an honesty that made her laugh. In the laundrette, Gary made him watch videos of people being ruined by the internet, then videos of people being made by it. They all had the same light in their eyes, which either meant the light had to be there or the light came on when it was pointed at you. He studied their mouths. He practised standing with one foot slightly in front of the other, like a person in a magazine. He bought a shirt that didn't belong to him yet from a shop where young men rolled the sleeves the way people on telly do.\n\nHe didn't sleep well. The bedsit magnified the smallest sounds, as small rooms do, so that every mote became a mote with a face. He sat up and drank water and thought of his mother humming. She had had a voice like a kettle just before it whistles. You could hear the promise in it, the potential for something louder. He thought about his dad, who had had a voice like a door closing. He tried to remember the last time someone had clapped for him. He couldn't, so he made a time up. He decided it had happened when he fixed the lift that one winter, and Mrs Penney clapped, because she did sometimes, with a single crisp sound that meant well done and please stop.\n\nWhat surprised him was the way people came to him with their stories. A boy from Year 6 told him about his mum's midnight shifts because of the electricity. A teacher told him about a man she had wanted to be with and wasn't. The postman told him about singing in a bar in Malaga every August, because his wife made him and then he didn't want to stop. He absorbed all of it. It lent weight to the idea that he was part of something. That he could be embellished with all their could-have-beens.\n\nOn a Friday, the school held its assembly for \"Music Through the Ages\" which was mostly an opportunity for Mrs Penney to play the piano and for the students to move their mouths in a way that could be called singing if the lights were low. Tom watched from the side like a stagehand. At the end, someone\u2014Sandra probably\u2014called him up. \"Mr Merriweather will sing us out.\" It wasn't ordered; it wasn't kindness exactly. It was like being pushed gently into a pool.\n\nHe went. The hall was indiscretely bright. The piano waited like furniture. He stood and he put one foot in front of the other like a magazine and he opened his mouth and the sound came. He thought it good. He thought it strong on certain vowels. He thought it wobbled on purpose. The children watched him with that odd attention children have for adults who are being the wrong sort of adult. He finished and there was clapping, thin and combined like the sound of rain on a tin roof. He caught Gary in the doorway because of course he had come and of course he was leaning, and Kira next to him with eyes like a cartoon. He tried not to cry, which would have made everything worse and better.\n\nHe received a packet in the post the following Tuesday, which made the day open like a mouth. It had his name on a label he kept and placed under a magnet shaped like a strawberry. Inside there were forms, as Marianne had said, asking about allergies and availability and whether he agreed to be filmed in the vicinity of his workplace and what charity he would dedicate his performance to. He chose the hospice because the hospice was the only place people had said his name with gentleness in their mouths that week in his whole life. He signed where required. He used his best pen, which meant it didn't work on the first try.\n\nThe film crew said they'd come on Friday afternoon, to catch him at his work and at his leisure. He spent twenty minutes wondering if he had leisure, decided he did not, decided it could be invented. He told Mrs Penney, who nodded stiffly and ordered the children to be feral somewhere else. He told Kira and she did something to her hair that made it look like an apology. He told Gary, who said he would be available to play himself as the \"sarcastic friend with heart of gold\" if the budget allowed. He cleaned the corridor twice that morning, because he wanted it to shine in a way that the camera would think was natural.\n\nThey arrived with equipment in cases that made him feel as if he had been cast as a destination. Two people: a cameraman who had tattoos peeking like secrets from under his sleeves, and a producer whose ponytail could have been a metronome. They had names, but they said them quickly, as if they were interchangeable. They had a list of shots that had been chosen to make him look competent and humble and, ideally, charming in an entirely non-threatening way. \"Can we get you opening a door?\" the producer asked as if this were a test.\n\n\"I can open a door,\" he said, with the gravity of someone who could.\n\nThey filmed him opening three doors, from different angles. They filmed him sweeping a corridor. They filmed him adjusting a chair. They asked him if he could sing while sweeping and he said yes and then he did, and it felt silly until it felt right, and then it felt silly again. Children wandered into frame and were gently moved by the corralling arms of the producer, who did this without touching anyone, like a magician. They asked him questions, and he answered in sentences that made sense until later when he thought perhaps they had not. \"Why do you want this?\" \"Because it's a wanted thing.\" \"What does music mean to you?\" \"It's a coat that fits.\" \"What will you do if you win?\" \"Probably cry. Then mop up.\"\n\nThey filmed him in his bedsit, which made him flinch. He had tidied but there is a way that a room reveals a person even when the person thinks they have closed curtains over their soul. The camera saw everything: the strawberry magnet, the folded napkin with a drawing of a microphone, the post-it with his name on it, the old teapot that had belonged to a woman who hummed. They asked him to sing there too. He did. It was strange how the room absorbed the noise, how the walls listened like friends trying not to smile.\n\nAfter they left, he sat in the quiet and felt like someone had taken a blueprint of him and folded it back into something else. He tried not to wonder how he would look on a screen. He tried not to imagine the sound of strangers clapping. He went to the window and put his palm flat against the cool glass, because sometimes a person needs to be stopped by something.\n\nHe ate beans on toast and forgot to put pepper on it, which his mother would have called a sin even if she hadn't believed in anything. He lay on the bed and stared at the crack in the ceiling he called Norway because of its shape. He tried to pray, but it looked like talking to himself and he laughed instead. The laugh sounded thin. A bus wheezed past. The floorboard above squeaked and was still. He logged into nothing and thought about all the songs he couldn't choose. He practised silence, because he'd been told once that the best singers knew it. He called Nina and hung up before it connected. He picked up the phone again and put it down again and then he slept because he'd exhausted his options.\n\nThe film ran on the local news on Wednesday. Gary recorded it in a way that involved an external hard drive and swearing. They gathered at The Oast House to watch it because it turns out there are rituals even for people who don't have rituals. The pub smelled of damp coats and chips and wet wood. Kira wiped down the bar with theatrical thoroughness. When the segment came on, everyone noticed at once, because the atmosphere changed; it became the sort of quiet that isn't quiet at all.\n\nThere he was, on the screen, a smaller him inside a bigger him. He watched himself roll a bin, beautiful in its ugliness. He watched himself open a door with the tenderness of a man touching a sleeping baby. He watched himself answer questions and he looked like a person who had been told a joke that he didn't get but decided to laugh at anyway. He heard his own voice and thought it strange that it sounded like that, both thinner and thicker than the one he knew. The children were in it too in a blur, faces left anonymous by the cunning of editing. The piece ended with him on the steps outside, the river behind him doing its best to look like it meant it, and him saying, \"We deserve lights sometimes, even if it's just a torch under a chin.\" The pub clapped because of course it did, and the sound made him want to sit on the floor.\n\nAfterwards, people came up and touched his arm like it was a talisman. A woman said he reminded her of her husband, who could do almost what he could but didn't. A man said he'd vote for him if voting was allowed. Someone bought him a pint of lemonade and then someone else upgraded it to a proper pint that he accepted because refusing made people feel embarrassed about their generosity. Nina texted a picture of her TV with his face on it and wrote: Honestly, you. Then: I'm proud, which he read three times because it didn't look like a word she would write unless she was choosing.\n\nHe walked home a local hero, which is to say people decided to see him. A teenager called him Legend which is the word all teenagers keep in their pockets for anyone who looks them in the eye without flinching or selling them something. He took it and tucked it somewhere he would find when he needed it. He climbed the stairs and put his key in the lock and listened to the tiny sound it made. The hinges greeted him like he had taught them to. The carpet smelt like new, which it never did. He sat on the bed and tried not to rehearse winning and losing. He rehearsed instead the moment when he would walk on to the stage and there would be that tunnel of light and he would be in it and he would not be afraid. He was tired beyond the place tiredness comes from. He lay down and the bedsit held him like a carton holds an egg, and he slept\u2014he slept like someone who has a job to do and wants to do it well, even if the job is waking up.\n\nThe next morning, everything went wrong in small polite ways. The kettle refused to boil to the required level of anger. His shirt decided to be crumpled in a pattern he had no iron for. The sky might rain, or not. On the way to school, a bus sprayed him with a courteous arc of clean water. \"Bless you,\" he said to the bus, because he could be generous.\n\nAt St. Pilgrim's, a pipe burst in the Year 1 cloakroom and wrote its name in damp along the baseboard. He shored it up with a bar towel and a clamp and a prayer and later with a plumber who came in with an attitude and revised it to something workable. Children skated on the wet floor because that is what they do when faced with a hazard. He swore under his breath in a language Nina would have recognised. He held the door for a teacher whose hands overflowed with art. He made a tea that looked right and did nothing and he drank it anyway.\n\nHis phone vibrated around midday. Another number. He answered because he had learned to answer now that there were more things that might be news.\n\n\"Tom? It's Marianne,\" she sang, her bright tone dented. \"Everything's fine. It's fine. Just\u2014there has been a tiny change. It's nothing. Don't worry.\"\n\n\"I will worry if you say don't,\" he said. \"That's how I am.\"\n\n\"It's about the dinner,\" she said. \"The pre-final dinner next week with the sponsors. It's quite small. Will you be all right? It's at Le Pingouin. There's a menu. We\u2014someone mentioned you might be vegetarian. Are you?\"\n\n\"Only by accident,\" he said, and he meant it. \"I'll be fine. I'll be brilliant. I'll wear my shirt.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she said. \"All right then. See you Friday for the rehearsal bit. You're doing so well.\" The last sentence sounded like something she says to children who had made numbers on a sheet happen in a certain order. He wanted to be offended and couldn't quite be.\n\nLe Pingouin was not a place he went to. He had walked past it and felt the chill that comes off posh places like a air-conditioning set to discomfort. He imagined now what he would look like inside it, with his new shirt and the eager way he would speak and the way his hands spoke for him. He practised saying \"medium rare\" and then corrected to \"well-done\" because he'd never quite learned to trust red. He imagined linen napkins, and everyone saying each other\u2019s names over and over.\n\nHe told Gary, who said, \"Don't let them put anything into your drink that glows in the dark. And don't let them make you sing into a cutlery holder. That's a trick.\"\n\nHe told Kira, who said, \"People like you or they don't, Tom. Fancy knives don't change that. Don't go in hungry. Wear your heart in your chest, not your sleeve. And for the love of the gods of Kent, don't take a selfie with a prawn.\"\n\nHe promised all the things a man promises when he wants to be trustworthy and has few tools beyond the sincerity of his face. He could feel the days narrowing, a funnel to a point that glinted. He could feel that there would be a moment when he would think a thought he wouldn't be able to change. He had had those before. He tried not to look for them.\n\nThat evening, a new poster appeared on the mural wall that said, THIS IS YOUR MOMENT in a font so enthusiastic it was almost rude. He thought of crossing out the word YOUR and writing OUR but he had no pen.\n\nHe went home with a bag of shopping that had aspirations. The little Tesco near the river had put the posh pasta on special and he felt fancy choosing the shells that looked like something you could put to your ear. He bought tomatoes and the basil that came in a pot so even the leaves sounded like they've got something to live for. He chose a kilogram of lemons because it seemed like a thing a person who could sing might do for reasons that would be revealed later. He put everything on the counter like offerings.\n\nMr Dray knocked after nine. He never knocked. He coughed through the open air instead, most days. He stood in the doorway with a face like someone who had looked for something all day and found he ought to have been looking somewhere else.\n\n\"You made the telly,\" he said, as if he were translating from a dialect. \"You sounded all right.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Tom said. He stepped aside. \"Do you\u2014do you want to come in?\"\n\nMr Dray looked at the threshold like it had rules. \"No. No. Just. Don't get silly. They make you silly. Sing into your pillow when you need to. Not for them. For you.\" He left without a goodbye, which counted as kindness in his language.\n\nTom closed the door and leaned his head against it because it was becoming a habit. He could feel the world on the other side of the wood. He could feel all the versions of himself he'd been gathering like paperweights. He whispered the names of songs to the crack in the ceiling. He decided which one would show him at his best, which is a different question to which one he loved.\n\nHe tried to picture the stage in Tunbridge Wells. He had been to the Assembly Hall once, university girls singing a cappella in dresses that knew what they wanted. He remembered the feel of the seats, a bit too polite. He remembered not knowing where to put his hands. He imagined now hearing his name through the speakers, a small local name carried proudly to the far corners of a very ordinary soundscape. He practised walking onto the stage. He practised not tripping. He practised saying \"Thank you\" without a bleat.\n\nHe slept finally with the window crack-open and the river smuggling in its breath. He dreamed of a corridor that went on so long it had to be a lie, and of a mop that was also a microphone, and of his mother standing in the wings with her hands wrapped in her jumper sleeves, watching him like everything was happening for the right reasons.\n\nMorning came. It does. He was tired. He put on his new shirt for no good reason other than to test it for fits. It fit. He made tea, and the tea was the right colour, which happens sometimes and you should not pretend it isn't a blessing. The day went as days do. He swept and fixed and opened and closed. He thought about the dinner and the stage and the light. He kept thinking of the corridor in his dream. Some doors staying shut, and some opening, and some painted to look like they would.\n\nHe found a feather in the cloakroom, grubby at the end, beautiful at the top. He picked it up and tucked it behind his ear and then took it out because he remembered he was seen. He put it in his pocket instead. He did not imagine himself a bird. He imagined himself a man with a feather in his pocket, which is different, and gentler.\n\nHe whistled. He forgot he was not supposed to. The corridor looked down at him fondly and with reproach. He accepted both. He moved along the day toward the promise of a small white tablecloth and the first bite of a dinner that would make him think he had been invited to the inside of something. He moved along the day toward an evening in which someone would pour him a glass of wine and, perhaps, a person would say, \"So, Tom, tell us about yourself,\" and he would say, \"I repair things,\" and that would be enough. He moved along the day toward the part of the story he had begun telling himself at night, in the places between waking and whatever that other thing is that isn't dying and isn't peace and isn't even rest, but stands in for them when there is no time left for thinking.\n\nIn the corridor by the Year 3 classroom, the sunlight made a rectangle on the floor that looked like a window you could step into. He stepped into it, because he had a second, and in that shaft of gold he raised his arms and he sang one note, long and ridiculous. The lights didn't shake. The walls didn't crack. A child walked by and laughed and then did a cartwheel, uninvited, perfect. He bowed to the child like she was an audience of many, and she bowed back, solemn as a tiny monarch, and then was gone, and the day went on.",

He could feel the dinner ahead of him the way you feel weather through a window: something pressing and interesting that didn't have to do with the room you were in until it did. He tried to pick a song the way a person tries to choose a suitcase for a long trip, not too heavy and not too flimsy, something that would arrive intact no matter how it was handled. He tried them on in the hall at St. Pilgrim\u2019s with his mouth for a mirror and the sprung floor judging him gently. Molly Malone made him think too much about his mother and not enough about the notes. A hymn nudged at him and he pushed it away because he didn't want to be mistaken for pious when all he was was faithful. Then in the cleaner's cupboard, where the light always came on with the lag of a thought, he found himself singing something that had been part of the furniture of his head so long he'd forgotten it had a name: The Water Is Wide, the kind of song that makes room for mistakes and means them. He sang it once and then he sang it again quieter and found that the second time the cupboards held their breath for him.\n\nHe took himself to the library because he trusted rooms full of paper to tell the truth without flinching. The librarian had a brooch shaped like a lark and a way of stamping dates like she was pinning butterflies. He told her he needed books on folk songs and she led him to a shelf as if to say, Here are other people's mouths you can borrow. He sat at a table scored by pencils that had lived a long time and traced lyrics with his finger like they might smudge. He read old words that had outlasted the hands that had made them and thought that perhaps that was the least he could ask for a night on a stage: to be a conduit. He hummed into the pages, which was ridiculous and made him feel happy, and the lark-brooch lady didn't scold him, which made him love her. He copied out The Water Is Wide in his own handwriting because he had an idea that if he wrote it down he could carry it with more respect. When he reached the line about leaning on a trusty friend, he smiled without meaning to and thought of a laundrette with a man behind a counter who could hack an election if he felt like it and chose instead to fix people's spin cycles.\n\nHe told Gary his choice and Gary approved with a face that didn't let on that it approved, which is the only way Gary ever approved of anything. \"It's old enough not to sue you and strong enough to keep you upright,\" he said, turning the pronouns in a way that made Tom feel steadied. \"Sing it like you aren't trying to impress anyone you'll never meet. And for the love of everything, do not attempt a key change unless you are offered a knighthood midway.\" Kira listened as if she were learning the shape of a storm and said she would take a long break and stand in the back during the final so he could pretend the dark was full of people who wanted what he wanted. \"Also,\" she added, wiping a glass that had no smudge, \"if Marianne asks you to do your song as a snippet at the dinner, you tell her you will give them a hum and a smile and they can pay for the full show later. No freebies for the penguins.\"\n\nOn Thursday, he went to the hospice because he had written their name on a form and it seemed sensible to show his face to the place he had given his heart. The reception smelled like clean laundry and dignity. A nurse with a tattoo of a forget-me-not on her wrist recognised him from the news and laughed the kind of laugh people do when the world has done something benign and inexplicable. She walked him along a corridor that had soft pictures of trees where there would be windows if money and architecture were kinder. He didn't go into any rooms because he had resolved not to make anyone's last days into a thing that gave him something, but he sang a verse under his breath to the carpet anyway. At the end of the corridor a woman in a green dressing gown sat with her feet in slippers that looked like boats. \"Oh,\" she said, as if she had found a coin. \"You are that caretaker. Sing the river one.\" He did a fragment, nothing that would break the air, and her eyes shone in a way that could have been pain or joy or merely eyes doing their job in a room where something sort-of nice had happened. The nurse squeezed his elbow, which is not a place people often squeeze, and as he left he thought of Nina saying, Don't let them use you, and of how complicated the word them always is.\n\nFriday's rehearsal at the Assembly Hall made him feel like an ant in a jewellery box. He signed his name on a sheet next to other names that had better angles than his did. He watched a girl in a red coat flocked with tiny moths warm up by turning her mouth into a trumpet and admired the efficiency of it. A boy with hair that looked rehearsed had a guitar in a case that could have survived a crash, and an older man with a waistcoat you could draw maps on stood with his hands in pockets like the pockets might talk if he let them. Marianne materialised with her ponytail and her clipboard and the kind of smile you put on when you're about to direct traffic on a motorway no one agreed to stand on. She touched his arm like it was a button that would reassure him and pointed him towards a stagehand called Shaz who smelled faintly of fresh sawdust and wore a radio like a second ear. \"Mic check, love,\" Shaz said, handing him a microphone with tape around it that announced the number 3 as if it were auspicious.\n\nThe stage was a country all of its own. The floor was black and sticky with history and the lights were the kind that don't decide whether to flatter or expose you until it's too late. A man in the back who answered to FOH and Matt in equal measure asked him to say his name and address like a person on a complaint call. He said them and heard his voice come back at him smug and bigger than it had ever been. He thought of what his mother would have said: Stand up straight or you'll tell them you don't mean it. Shaz told him, \"Don't eat the mic, pet. Let it hear you like you trust it. Sing past it, not into it.\" He tried, and the first note snuck out as if worried it was in the wrong place, and then the second drew itself up and the third did something good around the edges. He put one foot in front of the other like the magazine had taught him and tried not to watch himself in his head as he did it.\n\nIn the corner, Marianne watched with two other people who were probably important, if only because they looked like they were rehearsing being unimpressed in case the real thing turned up. She smiled at his chorus with her teeth and at his verse with her eyes and made a note when he tangled his tongue at a line that had never tangled before. \"It's the lights,\" Shaz said later, friendly and fierce in the same sentence. \"They don't just light you. They weigh you. Don't let them. Park your nerves in the wings with the push-brooms. We'll guard them. Go on then, once more for me and imagine you're singing to a wall you love.\"\n\nHe did and the wall obliged him by becoming the river in his head and the corridor at school and his mother's face at two in the morning when the kettle hasn't quite told you yet what it intends. When he finished, Matt in the back nodded, which might have been a trick of the light but felt like a thing a person could put in a pocket. He thanked the air, because there was no one else to thank without looking like a man who needed a hug. The other contestants clapped like people who understood exactly where they were and how much it took to get there, which was to say politely and without the dangerous generosity that can scupper a person who isn't expecting it.\n\nAfter rehearsal, Marianne handed him a lanyard with his face on it in glossy and text that made him look called. \"Le Pingouin on Tuesday,\" she said, the French drifting in her mouth like a decorative fish. \"Seven for seven-thirty. Dress smart. Smart-smart, not just smart.\" He didn't ask her to define it because he was learning that sometimes the trick is to guess and let people tell you how well you guessed afterwards. She mentioned sponsors like a weather forecast: a local bank that had renamed itself after a kind of tree, a chain of garden centres with confusing ambitions, a telecoms firm that turned out to be a man. \"They're lovely,\" she said. \"They all think music saved them and want to return the favour at scale.\"\n\nSaturday he wanted to be useful, so he over-shined the hall floor until it stared back at him offended. He oiled the hinges of the cupboard that refused to let the netballs breathe. He fixed a high window with a pole and a patience that would have chastened monks. Children weren't there and the building made its building noises unselfconsciously; the sighs and ticks and the gurgle in the radiators like someone telling a joke with too much preamble. He sang into the emptiness and it took the sound and laid it down somewhere he couldn't see. He told himself not to think of dinner and failed by lunchtime. He took his new shirt out of its bag and ironed it as if he were flattening a landscape. He borrowed a jacket from the charity shop with lavender and bright wool and it fitted in the way some things fit when you pretend not to care if they don't.\n\nHe called Nina and it rang unusually long, then her voice turned up brisk and textured like toast. He told her when and where and she told him to send a drop pin, which he couldn't, so he promised to text the name and a description of the door. \"Don't let anyone take you outside to show you a car,\" she said, as if this were the kind of place where men in coats would attempt to sell him timeshares in shame. \"Sit near someone you can talk about the weather with if it goes wrong. Weather saves conversations. And if they make you speak, keep it under thirty seconds and say a joke that doesn't ask anyone to laugh. Then everyone will.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Le Pingouin presented itself like a bird that had heard rumours about swans. The windows were glossy and the door had a handle that made your hand feel judged. Inside, everything was flatteringly lit and the tables wore white like a promise. Tom stood in the entrance and tried not to look like he was thinking of carpet stains. Marianne appeared in a dress that would have been a different person if it had a choice and steered him into a room where noise made little fountains in corners. \"Tom,\" she said brightly to a cluster of people who were both one person and many, \"this is Tom Merriweather, our Community Champion wildcard. Tom, these are our partners.\" They said their names and their roles and their companies, and he nodded at the appropriate times and produced his handshake like a good coat.\n\nThe other finalists were arranged like a set of possibilities. Red-coat trumpet-mouth was called Lana and had a laugh she kept under the table where she could kick it if necessary. The boy with the guitar was Dev and he did something in IT that he treated like a hobby when he talked about singing, which made Tom like him more. The waistcoat man was Mr Crozier and he showed his teeth when he smiled as if he were paying tax on the gesture. There was Aisha, seventeen and exacting and accompanied by parents who were trying hard not to look as if they had smuggled their hearts in under their jackets. There were two more: a woman named Paula who ran a choir in Sittingbourne and had very careful hair, and an ex-club singer everyone called Les because that was his name and also because it was the right size.\n\nThey ate things that tasted like concepts before they tasted like food. Tom took small sips of wine and then larger sips of water and looked at the menu as if it had opinions about him. He found the cheapest thing and couldn't order it without confessing, so he picked a chicken dish with a name that had gone to university. Conversation eddied and broke against him and rejoined elsewhere. Someone asked him what time he started work and he said six and they said, \"Oh, your day is our nightmare,\" and he laughed because it was true and not. A woman from the bank asked him if he believed music had the power to heal communities, and he said it had the power to make them stand still for a bit and that was a start, and she wrote that down as if he had said something clever, which he supposed he had by accident.\n\nHalfway through the main course, a man with a tie that resembled a quiet argument stood and tapped a spoon on a glass. The sound made Tom want to reach for a Jacob's cracker. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" the man said, and the room did what rooms do to that phrase. \"What an honour to support such talent. We thought, perhaps, we might persuade one of our fabulous finalists to give us a little foretaste of Friday? Just a bar or two.\" He smiled at the group in a way that made them all feel hospitable. Tom looked at Marianne, whose smile did something not entirely kind to her face and then recovered. Dev was looking studiously at a bread roll as if it had embarrassed him. Lana shook her head once in a small circle that said not tonight in a dialect only performers use. Les was halfway to standing because Les was born standing in rooms like this and sat back down because someone put a hand on his sleeve.\n\nTom felt people glance at him in that way the English have when they want someone else to be brave so they can applaud quietly without admitting to having wanted anything. He thought of Kira's voice in his head telling him no freebies for the penguins and of Shaz saying park your nerves in the wings. He put his napkin down slowly to give himself time not to be heroic. \"I could hum,\" he said, and the table laughed as if he had told a joke, which perhaps he had. \"Or,\" he added, more steady now that he had a sentence sitting in front of him, \"I could say that you'll hear us all properly when we're meant to be heard. I think I'll keep mine for the stage. Or the corridor. I'm very good in corridors.\" There was a ripple that might have been disappointment and might have been respect, and the tie-man nodded like a person who had been refused kindly and knew not to push it.\n\nHe went outside anyway between pudding and speeches because he needed air and also needed the feeling of being in a place he recognised. The alley beside the restaurant smelled of lemons that had been made to suffer and of the back of the world. A kitchen porter in a paper hat stood smoking a cigarette as if it owed him money. \"All right?\" the porter said, as if they were both in a queue for something that might change them. \"I saw you on the telly. My nan fancies you.\" Tom considered the compliment, decided to enjoy it, and laughed. He told the porter he was going to sing a river and the porter said, \"Make it a clean one then. I'm sick of dirty water,\" and dropped his cigarette into a tin of sand like a ceremony. Tom hummed two bars and the alley felt better and then he went in before anyone could decide he'd been gone too long.\n\nThe speeches were as speeches tend to be: time converted into syllables. People said words like platform and journey and passion as if they were buying train tickets. Tom clapped whenever eyes turned to him. He drank his coffee as small as possible because he had seen men make mistakes on the third coffee and didn't want to join them. At the end, Marianne squeezed his shoulder with her hand shaped like a metronome and said, \"You handled that beautifully,\" and he could hear the relief in it like a draught. \"We don't actually want it, you know, the song in the dining room. We only want to say we asked.\"\n\nHe walked back to the station because the night deserved someone to witness it on foot. The windows of the shops were full of things pretending to be asleep. He paused at the old cinema even though it was out of his way and read the names on the marquee, which were not names he knew but did the job anyway. A fox loped across the road like a man late for a meeting he didn't want to attend. He felt, for a brief ridiculous second, that everything had arranged itself carefully so that he could be in this exact spot to feel exactly what he felt, which was the kind of thought that if you pick at it becomes arrogance or a poem.\n\nWednesday morning he found a note under the door at St. Pilgrim's written in pencil on lined paper: Dear Mr Merriweather, will you sing us out on Friday before your big sing? Love, Year 3. Someone had drawn a microphone that might have been a lollipop and a star with more points than was strictly necessary. He showed it to Mrs Penney who made a face like one does when tasting soup that was better than expected. \"Ten minutes at the end,\" she said. \"No sob story. We'll do that at the fete when the summer fails us. We'll have the children hum with you, on the chorus, so you don't get lonely.\" He put the note in his wallet next to Kira's napkin and the strawberry magnet pressed it all flat on his fridge when he got home, because that was how talismans liked to be kept: close together, being quietly useful.\n\nGary kept him from the internet as if he were warding off a cold. \"They've started to discuss you,\" he said at the laundrette, scrolling with his thumb as if politely rubbing a stain. \"You are 'authentic' and 'one of those kooky ones' and someone has written that you're fake and cynical and there to tick a box. That's three out of four internet food groups. Do not read it. I'm not even reading it. I'm reading it for you and telling you not to read it.\" Tom nodded and looked instead at the washing machines going around in their little universes and felt grateful to live in a time when something so ordinary looked like a miracle.\n\nThursday night he paced his bedsit the way a man paces who is not allowed to run away and does not want to. He pressed his hand to the wall where Mr Dray's cough came from when it came, and it didn't, and he thought about knocking and didn't, and then he did knock and Mr Dray opened the door as if he'd been standing just behind it waiting for something to turn. \"Sing into your pillow?\" Mr Dray said without preamble, and when Tom shook his head he said, \"Good. Save it. They'll give you light. Take what you need and leave before the light changes its mind.\" It was more words than Tom had ever heard from him in one breath and it felt like a benediction delivered by a man who had resigned from the priesthood in 1979 and still knew the motions.\n\nHe barely slept and when he did he found himself in the corridor again, the one that had continued beyond itself for the length of a dream, doors numbered in a logic that could not have stood up under cross-examination. He walked past BRAVERY and HUMOUR and REGRET and STOP SINGING, which had been stuck on with playful cruelty. He tried the handle marked WATER and it opened onto a room that was all windows and somewhere there was his mother humming, not to him this time but to herself as if she liked the company. He woke with his mouth open and a note in it he had to swallow.\n\nFriday at St. Pilgrim's had the feel of a day that had remembered itself. The children were noisy without malice. A glue stick went missing and turned up in the place you keep glue sticks when you want to be found. He made a last round that wasn't last and corrected a wobbly display of planets so that Saturn didn't look like a hat. At two-fifty, he stood in the hall and the school collected itself like a flock that had decided to be one thing for five minutes. He told them that songs were bridges you could put down between two places that didn't agree about the river and that if they wanted they could stand on it and look, and they laughed because he sounded like a teacher and he wasn't. He sang The Water Is Wide and asked them to hum the chorus and the hum came, a woolly blanket of sound that covered the floor and the walls and the time between the bell and whatever came after.\n\nWhen he walked off the stage-that-was-a-stage-and-also-a-hall, he didn't trip. His legs felt as if he had gone somewhere far and returned with nothing you could show and everything you could use. The day tightened behind him like a knot that holds. He folded the lanyard he had been told not to fold and put it in his pocket anyway. He put the feather from the cloakroom into his wallet next to the napkin and the note and the form that had named his charity. He checked his tool bag because it calmed him. He told the door on the way out, \"Wish me a light that doesn't lie,\" and the door swung as if to say, You'll have what you have, and that will be enough.\n\nHe met Nina at the bus stop because good sisters arrive at bus stops like small miracles. She hugged him in that older-sister way that is half scolding, half armour. She had brought a bottle of water and a packet of mints and a look that said she could fight a dragon with a biro. \"Don't be late,\" she said, and he said, \"I won't,\" and she said, \"Don't be early either,\" and he laughed because she had, with that one sentence, explained everything about him that needed explaining. They walked to the Assembly Hall without saying anything invented. He could feel the tilt of the earth under his shoes and believed for the first time that he might not fall off. Inside, the lights waited and the seats waited and somewhere in the wings Shaz was waiting with a radio and Matt with a nod, and behind his heart the part of him that had always wanted a small merciless stage had stopped hiding. He stood in the corridor that led to the wings and thought of the rectangle of sunlight by Year 3 and of the cartwheel and of the bow and this time when he raised his arms he didn't sing. He breathed, and the breath was the size of a life.",

                              "content": "Backstage smelled of paint that had not fully decided to be dry and of metal scaffolds turning light into geometry. Tom stood with his back to a wall that had met more performances than any critic and breathed as if the air had to be persuaded. Nina was beside him with her handbag like a shield and a calm that was ninety percent act, ten percent training. She spoke softly because the space asked for it, the way churches do, and reminded him of things he already knew: that his feet belonged under him, that his mouth could find the shapes it needed, that the worst thing that would happen would be that he would sing and then he would stop. Shaz buzzed past like a friendly wasp, eyes everywhere, radio chattering. She checked his mic pack and smoothed the cable on his shirt as if it were a ribbon on a present she intended to give the room, then told him again not to eat the mic and to sing past it, not into it. He nodded too many times and she gave him a face which translated as, one nod is enough, sweetheart, save the others for later.\n\nThe host strode on in a blue suit that had been chosen by a person who hated blue and the audience responded with that particular British enthusiasm that manages to be loud and self-conscious at the same time. Tom couldn't see much of them yet, just a hint of heads beyond the wings and the curve of the balcony like the lip of a cup. He listened to the patter that warmed them up, the jokes about Tunbridge Wells and parking and how this was the night dreams were made and politely declined, and he felt a wave of affection for people who showed up to be part of something even when they couldn't name what it was. Marianne glided in, clipboard held like a hymn book, and put a hand on his upper arm to steady him or herself. She gave him the order\u2014the first half would belong to three, then an interval and a raffle and a photo op where he would have to stand near a banner that pretended to be a real thing. He was fourth, she said, just after Dev and before Mr Crozier, which felt like standing between a boy at the beginning of a climb and a man who had already decided the view wasn't as good as advertised.\n\nFrom the wings he watched Lana become a mouth made for trumpets and sorrow and light. She sang something he didn't know but recognised the shape of, and the audience made a sound that wasn't clapping, not yet, but was the sound you make when your attention has been captured. She left the stage with her shoulders relaxed by two degrees and didn't look at anyone because she didn't want to let the look turn into anything else. Dev went next and made the guitar behave as if it had applied for the role of spine and been hired. He had the decency to look terrified between verses and charmed during them, which made the audience believe him. Tom clapped in the dark and shook his hands loose the way Shaz had shown him, fingers tingling, wrists warm, and he thought of the hall at school and the rectangular sunlight, which was a much smaller light but had the same merciless kindness.\n\nWhen the stage manager held up three fingers and then two and then one, he stepped forward like a man walking onto a ferry. He hadn't expected the floor to sound like that under his shoes; it sounded like it knew the weight of him and it wasn't offended. The mic stand was at his height already because Shaz was a witch for measurements, and the stage lights did their best to turn him into a person who was both only himself and not singular at all. He looked out and saw not faces but the suggestion of faces, the way you know a flock is birds without counting. He thought of the corridor at St. Pilgrim's and of Mrs Penney\u2019s hybrid smile and of Gary's thumbs-up with a skull, which was how some men say prayer. He breathed again as if it mattered and said his name because the host had asked him to and added, against his own preparations, \"I fix things,\" which was not a sob story and not nothing and made two women in row E look at each other with that pleased surprise people keep for a phrase that tucks under the rib.\n\nThe first note came from far back in him, somewhere near where the winter coats live, and arrived at his mouth intact. He had started gentler in the rehearsals, but the room asked for a thread drawn firmly and so he drew it. The Water Is Wide moved through him as if it had found a riverbed where it had not expected one and decided to be hospitable. He didn't look at the judges with their pens and their medals and their eyes that had seen everything. He looked at a point just beyond the front row where the darkness holds, and then at the corner where a piece of set met its partner and made a right angle that had never hurt anyone, and then at the space above his head where the dust danced like arguments forgiven. He kept his hands mostly still because Shaz had said stillness terrifies rooms in the right way, and because he wanted to see if his mouth was enough.\n\nIn the second verse he heard a cough as delicate as a teaspoon against a saucer and refused to let it be important. He leaned into the lines that knew him and allowed the ones that didn't to borrow his shape for the evening. In the chorus he didn't ask anyone for anything with words, but his voice angled the suggestion at the darkness and a handful of people accepted it without knowing they had. The hum arrived like a mistake everyone agreed to keep, and then grew because it had been welcomed, and then settled into a level that made him feel, for the first time that night, like he was exactly the right size. He didn't smile because smiling would have broken the glass of it, but the corners of his mouth did a thing they hadn't done in months, and Nina in the stalls started to breathe like a person who had been holding it too long.\n\nHe didn't attempt the showy fall-off at the end because he had promised Gary he wouldn't, and because he knew in some older part of himself that landing clean is more honest than attempting air and missing. The last word left him and hung for a second that was three seconds long and then the room returned to itself and clapped, which is what rooms do when they have been given something they hadn't ordered and found they liked. It wasn't a roar, because Kent is careful, but it was layered and warm and it grew when a man in the balcony decided to start it again, as if he'd dropped it and wanted a clean take. He bowed the way Shaz had shown him, small and sincere, and the light did not punish him for it.\n\nThe host came back on with a smile that had been ironed and said words that meant competent and surprising without saying them. The judges spoke their portion as if they were putting a dressing on something that had lived long enough without one. The radio man, who had a blazer that had known better evenings, said he had found the performance \"authentic,\" which is a word that can be friend or enemy, then added that he liked that Tom hadn't been tempted into tricks. The theatre director, a woman with a fringe like a guillotine, talked about the architecture of the song and the way he understood space, which made him want to look under the stage to see which beams she meant. The former pop star, who wore memory like perfume, said his pitch had wobbled at the top of the second verse but that if all wobbles were like that then childbirth would be easier, which earned him a laugh he didn't quite deserve but took anyway. Someone asked him about the hospice and he said one clean sentence and stopped, because he had promised Nina and also because grief blunts a room faster than it sharpens it.\n\nBack in the wings the air felt like the inside of his mouth after mint. He could hear the audience in the corridor of sound they made between acts and it no longer frightened him. Dev appeared and clapped his shoulder with the kind of hope men his age only allow themselves in the presence of guitars, and said something about the run into the third chorus that Tom would not remember properly later. Lana hugged him fiercely and quickly, all cheekbone and salt, and mused that his vowels were very Kent, which she meant as an astonishment. Mr Crozier nodded like a vicar seeing a good harvest and told him to never, under any circumstances, accept a cruise contract without reading the bit about hurricanes. He laughed and found himself wanting to tell his mother everything that had just occurred, which was ridiculous and correct.\n\nMr Crozier went on with a song that had a hundred nights in it and three marriages, and Paula followed with something choral and tidy that unfolded like a map, and Aisha sang like a blade being sharpened and the room remembered how young it isn't. The ex-club singer did the thing men like him do, which is to remind you that a room can be made to stand up even if it doesn't feel like it, and the audience stood for him because he ordered them to and they wanted to. Tom watched it all with the eyes of a man who had been allowed to put his spoon into the bowl and found the soup was shared. He did not compare, because comparing would be to look away from what had happened to him and make it smaller.\n\nInterval came with plastic cups and raffle tickets and a person shouting numbers into a semi-receptive din. Kira and Gary found him in a swipe of corridor where light and dark negotiated and told him what they were allowed to tell him without letting their faces break into the faces they wanted to make. Kira said he had made the room hush like she had seen only twice, once when a brawl had nearly started and once when a footballer had come in after a loss and everyone remembered they were people. Gary said he had not embarrassed himself and then rolled his eyes at himself and added that he had, in fact, more than achieved the brief, which was his way of kissing a man on the forehead without having to be present at the scene. Nina handed him water and a mint and pressed his hand harder than was strictly necessary, and in her eyes he saw the version of him that could go home now and be content even if no one said his name again from the stage.\n\nThey called them all back for a group bow because someone had decided there was time for it. The host spoke about votes, though the judging was mostly already judged, and about journeys, and about the way the region had talent like a hedgerow has sparrows if you'd only pay attention. Tom stood on his mark, which Shaz had made with tape like a small secret, and pretended to have learned how to share space. He held his lanyard in one hand because he liked the weight of his face on plastic and because it grounded him as well as any saint's bone. He looked out and this time he saw a few faces; people do that once the lights settle and the audience forgets to be one organism. He saw someone from the bakery and a kid from Year 6 with a father who looked surprised to be sitting and Mrs Penney in the aisle looking like a woman who approves of nothing and allows everything.\n\nWhen the time came to announce things, the room did that paradoxical thing and tightened while pretending to relax. Marianne stood in the wings counting on her fingers like a person at a bus stop to whom time had become a fruit. The judges murmured together with faces like knotty wood, and the host made an applause line where there didn't need to be one and everyone clapped anyway because it filled a dangerous second. Third place went to Dev, and he grinned with his eyes closed as if he were listening to a song no one else could hear. Second went to Lana, and she shook her head as if to dislodge a year and then bowed so beautifully that Tom wanted to take lessons in humility from her elbows. The first went to Aisha, because the world is occasionally tidy in its judgements, and her parents turned into statues that had to check their joints before they could sit. The roar for her came from teenagers who had arranged themselves in a block like a choir that knows a chant and from grandmothers who recognised what it had been like to have a twelve-note name at seventeen and carry it.\n\nAfter the big three, the sponsors did their bit in a line of photos with handshakes and oversized cheques that looked as if they had been ironed. There was a pause long enough for people to check their phones and then the ex-pop star leaned into the mic and mentioned, almost casually, that there was a special commendation for \"contribution to community,\" which is the kind of phrase that can go either way. He said Tom's name like he had been practising, and the applause happened in that gentle wave again and didn't die too soon, which is the courtesy applause dreams of. They invited him forward and he did his walking and shook the hand of a man who was more telecoms than flesh and held a plaque that would look like a certificate in dim light and a car park voucher in bright. The hospice got a cheque that made a nurse cry somewhere because that's what small cheques do; they arrive in a place that knows how to use small things properly. Tom said thank you and nothing else, because he could feel the hole in the floor that opens for men who think they have more to say than they do and he did not intend to fall into it tonight.\n\nAfter the photos and the thanks and the bit where everyone pretended food was imminent and then found it wasn't, they were released into a lobby that had opinions about carpet. People came up in drifts and told Tom that their cousin or their dog or their late grandfather would have loved that song, which is how humans measure proximity to the holy. A man with a face like an endangered bird said he didn't know the song but felt like he had and that this was a compliment; Tom accepted it as such and watched the man float away, lighter for having said words to a stranger. A local councillor with a tie that meant business told him that the council cared deeply about arts in the community and that perhaps there could be a mural with his face on it, and he laughed until she realised he was laughing and laughed too as if it had been a joke she had told.\n\nIn the corner by a stand of palms that had seen too much, Marianne leaned against a pillar briefly and closed her eyes. When she opened them, she saw Tom looking and gave him a small shrug that in her language equalled confession and relief. She told him quietly that they had worried about the wildcard, that visions of cynical tweets had haunted her, that she had imagined men in newspaper offices making tidy cruelty out of his laces and his face. He said he was glad he had taken that worry from her even if only for a night, and she laughed in shock and then hugged him because people hug men who make their jobs briefly resemble the thing they thought they'd wanted when they were twenty-four and earnest.\n\nWhen the lobby began to empty and the buzz faded to scraps that would be swept up with programmes, he took his plaque and his lanyard and his small important envelope and found a quiet bit of stair that had been painted grey because grey forgives. Nina sat beside him with her shoes in her hand and her chin tilted up like a person letting rain meet it. She told him he had done it, which was both true and unimportant now that it was done, and he told her she had been there, which was both obvious and vital. They didn't talk about Mum and they didn't talk about Dad because their names were in the air anyway eating up oxygen, and after a while they talked about the bus because there had to be something fixed and human to end on.\n\nThe night outside had the particular emptiness that follows crowds. He walked down the hill from the Assembly Hall holding the plaque a little away from his body because he didn't want to accidentally absorb any authority from it that wasn't earned. Gary and Kira peeled off toward the pub with promises of chips and a stern look that said there would be no singing tonight, only salt and vinegar and other ancient cures. Nina headed for her train with the kind of wave you give when you intend to see someone again on purpose, and he turned toward the river because all roads in his head led there now when they could.\n\nHe stood on the bridge as he had stood many times and let the water remind him that you can only step into it as yourself, not as the idea of yourself other people like to hold up like a lantern. The lights on the other side had done what lights do and softened the edges of everything, even the ugly bits, even the bits that had been designed by committees that didn't understand corners. He thought about the hum in the chorus and how it had needed no invitation beyond a steady line and a space to settle. He thought about the corridor at school and the girl doing a cartwheel and how some movements are involuntary and perfect when you are nine and almost impossible later when your bones learn about revenge.\n\nHe went home the long way because winners and losers alike should have to take the long way after any kind of battle. Finnerty's carpets had been locked properly by someone else for once and the stairs felt like they were more interested in holding him than tripping him. In the bedsit he put the plaque on the table next to the strawberry magnet and the napkin and the feather and the folded lanyard, and it looked ridiculous there, as if the table had put on a hat and regretted it. He boiled water twice because kettles are dramatic after big nights and made tea that was almost right. He sat on the bed and let the quiet introduce itself, which it did, politely and a little smug.\n\nSleep was slow to come because his body had decided to turn the night over and examine it for defects. As he lay there, he listened for Mr Dray and heard only the kind of silence that knows what it is doing. He put the palm of his hand against the wall the way you do with animals you want to make friends with and thought, very clearly, that he had placed himself under lights and been seen and had not been burned. He allowed himself a small silly thought that the door at St. Pilgrim's would swing a little easier for him on Monday out of respect, and then he told himself not to anthropomorphise wood and he laughed quietly and it sounded like it belonged to him.\n\nIn the morning, the day resembled other days more than one expects after a night that has dressed itself up. The toast was toast and not a symbol. The tea did its work without grandstanding. He took the plaque down to the carpet shop because Finnerty liked to display local successes next to the Axminster with pride, and Finnerty made a show of giving him a place near the till as if the plaque were a relative stopping by. He walked to St. Pilgrim's with his key ring in his palm and the key ring felt the same weight as ever and he did not resent it. The building flexed its muscles and yawned in pipes and gullies and allowed him in, and he told the doors good morning and meant it in a way he had not known he was capable of.\n\nChildren are excellent barometers of change; they decide which weather to believe in within seconds and rarely revise. In the Year 3 corridor, a boy with a cliff for a forehead asked him if he'd met anyone famous and Tom told him he had met himself, which made the boy pull a face as if presented with broccoli. In the hall, a Year 5 girl performed a sarcastic curtsy as she passed him and then turned it into a real one because she had misjudged the day and wanted to adjust. Sandra held his elbow and told him she'd recorded it and watched it twice and cried on the second time because the first was reconnaissance. Mrs Penney looked at him with her shoes pointing in a different direction, which is how she told him she was pleased and needed to be on time for Year 2's phonics regardless.\n\nHe fixed a locker that had learned to stutter and enjoyed the exactness of bolts. He uncoiled the hose and told it that it had never looked more serpentine and it allowed itself to be amused. The mop watched him from the corner with a level of respect it had previously reserved for visitors from the council. At lunch, he went to The Oast House and Kira tried to make him eat something with an egg on top and he declined and then accepted because she knew when he was being noble for no audience. Gary arrived late with eyes that had slept and printed a photo of him under the lights from a place on the internet where kindness had happened without supervision and sat it on the table like a small, harmless god.\n\nIn the days that followed, the world did not call him to bigger stages, which was a comfort if he was honest and a disappointment if he was being a clich\u00e9. There were a few emails that Marianne forwarded, some from people who wanted him to sing at fundraisers and one from a man who wanted to sell him slippers that corrected posture. He said yes to the first kind with the hospitality he had been shown and no to the second with the brevity the internet requires. He went to the hospice on a Thursday with the cheque and the nurse with the forget-me-not on her wrist grinned like a girl at a fair and let him sing in the corridor two full verses this time because a woman in Room 4 had asked and because rules are made by people who have never had to measure hours like that.\n\nSomething in him had been rearranged, but it wasn't a furniture you could point at. It was more like someone had moved a plug to a different wall and he could charge parts of himself he hadn't been able to before. He found himself humming when he fixed things and not worrying if anyone heard unless they were taking a test. He found that some of the children hummed back when they were supposed to be fetching lunchboxes, and he pretended to scold them and didn't really. He found that when he walked past the mural that currently said THIS IS YOUR MOMENT he didn't instinctively reach for a pen to edit it. He thought of adding and tomorrow too, but he decided the wall had earned a day off from commentary.\n\nNina phoned on a Sunday and told him that their Auntie Kel had seen him via a nephew's Facebook and had thoughts about trousers. He listened and agreed to disagree about the hems because there is a kind of argument that keeps people in the right relation to each other if conducted with enough tea. She asked him, at the end, quiet in her mouth, whether he was all right with having had a night and then returning to days, and he thought about lying and didn't. He told her it had been like standing under a waterfall and then walking to the corner shop, that both activities had turned out to be more related than he would have guessed. She told him he had always been a poet even when he was trying to be a cupboard and laughed at herself with affection.\n\nOn a damp Tuesday, he found a slip of paper in his pigeonhole at school with a note in a child's hand declaring that he should start a singing club because otherwise how would anyone know how. He held it and thought of rooms he could make slowly and carefully; rooms where humming was the weave and glue was permitted and posters were hand-drawn and the door would always be slightly ajar. He took the paper to Mrs Penney as if he were offering a foundling and she pursed her lips as if tasting soup again and said they'd make a slot on Wednesdays if he promised not to cause a riot. He promised to cause only manageable revolutions and she nodded like a queen being generous after a nap.\n\nThe first club met in the gym store because there was a plug and enough echo to flatter small braveries. Six children arrived and then two more and then Aisha's younger brother turned up with a recorder which he brandished like a weapon and was reassured was welcome. They sang a bit and talked a lot and he discovered that the thing he enjoyed more than singing for people might be convincing people that they can do it too, that their voices are not accidents but instruments with dust you can blow off. He taught them The Water Is Wide in a key that didn't frighten anyone and when they hummed the chorus he closed his eyes for a second and thought of the Assembly Hall and of how space can be persuaded to listen if you speak to it kindly.\n\nWhen he walked home that evening there was a thin light that can't be relied upon but makes promises anyway. Finnerty's sign clicked on with hope and the bedsit smelled like whatever Mr Dray had cooked\u2014something with onions and something else that felt proprietary\u2014and he stood in the doorway and felt, with what he realised was surprise, that his life fitted him. It was not a tailored thing. It didn't sit on the shoulders as if a man in a tape measure had sighed over it; it was a good charity-shop jacket that he had warmed into shape and that now felt like it would resist rain longer than it had a right to. He put the kettle on and it hissed its approval and he sang half a verse to the teapot because he could and because the room had earned a lullaby without an audience. The song floated into the corners and settled with the dust and with what had always been there, and if the mops stiffened a little less and the hinges minded their manners, well, that was only fair.",

                              "content": "It wasn't a new beginning exactly, but the days grew edges he could feel with his fingers. If he had been the sort of man to number things he'd have said it was chapter six, though he didn't write in chapters and he certainly did not keep an index. What he noticed instead was that the morning light came into his bedsit with a new habit of tapping at the glass, and that the kettle, when it boiled, sounded less like a reprimand and more like encouragement. He went to St. Pilgrim's with his ring of keys spinning a little faster than they had, like small moons taking their cue from a parent planet that had remembered to pull. The building greeted him with its usual creaks and he greeted it with his usual murmurs, but the conversation had shifted by a degree; it was as if the walls had decided to take him at his word.\n\nThe singing club began with six children and accrued two, then shed one to football and gained one from netball and ended up with nine, which felt like a number books liked. He ran it in the gym store because the echo there was friendly and the plug was in a place that didn't argue with extension leads. They began with humming because humming was democratic, then graduated to a round that made the space stack itself into a new shape. There was a boy called Keir who wanted to turn everything into beatboxing and a girl called Amara who sang so quietly that the sound seemed to draw itself with a pencil, and an older sister who arrived to collect a younger one and pretended not to care until she failed at pretending and stayed. Tom stood and moved his hands the way he'd seen conductors do on telly and discovered that the trick wasn't to command but to invite, and that if you left a gap people filled it with courage.\n\n\"What's the point of a singing club?\" a Year 4 boy asked bluntly on the second week, poking at the concept like it might be undercooked. \"We're not a choir. We don't even have uniforms.\"\n\n\"The point is to breathe together in a room,\" Tom said, pleased to hear himself say it and slightly appalled at the poetry of it. \"And to make something that didn't exist before the bell went. Also, biscuits on the last Thursday.\" The last sentence made immediate sense. He had learned that sugar bridged any gap that metaphysics couldn't.\n\nWhen he wasn't coaxing voices out of children he was building a universe out of cardboard because Goldilocks in Space had a deadline and Year 2 had expectations that were at once vague and adamant. The donkey-ship had grown a nose cone and a tail that looked like ambition. He had begged elastic bands from the office and bought silver paint with his own money after someone in the PTA declared that glitter was microplastic and therefore immoral. He hummed while he glued because it made the glue less sulky. He scraped a line of dried PVA off the tabletop with his thumbnail and thought about how all technologies end up being about holding and letting go in the right doses.\n\nAt The Oast House, Kira put a chalkboard up near the till that read, in an uncharacteristically neat hand, Singing Club Cake Sale, Friday 3:30, Please Be Nice. She claimed she would make brownies that could settle disputes between kingdoms and dared Tom to sing Mozart with his mouth full. Gary, who had rolled his eyes at the idea of helping in public and then turned up with a float tin and a cheap card reader that required coaxing, declared every fourth slice to be on the house if the purchaser could name a folk song that hadn't had its words changed by at least three great-aunts. Tom watched them and felt the odd ache of being held in place by a web of people who could find jokes in seriousness without untying the knot.\n\nMarianne rang on a Wednesday just after he'd retrieved a small pair of wellies from a gutter and was feeling benevolent. \"How would you feel about a feature?\" she asked, and he nearly dropped the phone because he'd never been asked how he'd feel about a feature before, unless you counted his dentist. It would be a \"where are they now\" for the regional show in three months, she said, a little piece to check in on his community heroism and perhaps find out whether he had been corrupted by fame. He laughed because he had not, unless you counted buying a second shirt. She laughed back in the way professionals do when they are pleased by an answer that fits a narrative they've already drafted. \"We'll call nearer the time,\" she said, which he now knew translated to, We will call when we need to fill three minutes and we think your face will be kind to our viewers.\n\nThe weather turned showy the way spring in Kent likes to, performing four seasons across a morning. One minute the Medway lay polite as a ribbon and the next it shrugged itself brown and busy. He stared down over the railings on the way to work and thought about the line in the song that had made people hum without being asked, and he decided that the river was not any one thing; it was a collection of attempts. He liked being an attempt. Attempts had more room to move in.\n\nOfsted announced themselves with an email that made the staffroom tilt. Mrs Penney read it aloud in a tone that suggested she could disarm a bomb if asked, and the room made the noises of people recalling the very best bits of themselves at speed. Lists appeared on the whiteboard with arrows that turned into new lists, and everyone said safeguarding to each other in the way people say hello in churches. Tom was handed a stack of policies thick enough to prop up a wobbly table and asked, very nicely but indisputably, to ensure that every door closed as if it had been designed by a manufacturer with a conscience.\n\n\"We don't have any time for singing,\" Mrs Penney told him shortly, which meant she had too much affection to lie. \"It is all paperwork and bleaches until Friday. Hide the donkey. The donkey is an Ofsted temptation.\"\n\n\"We could get Outstanding for the donkey alone,\" he protested mildly. \"It has emotional depth.\"\n\n\"It has a nasal cone held on by elastic bands, Mr Merriweather,\" she said, but she softened it with a glance at the cardboard and the way his hand had absently found the grain of the glue. \"All right, the donkey can survive in a neutralised environment. Put a sign on it that says This Is A Placeholder.\"\n\nThe first inspector to stride into St. Pilgrim's had a notebook with corners sharp enough to cut bread and a smile like a polite apology. Tom hovered at the edges of their path with his tool belt cinched and his mop behaving like a soldier at attention. He opened doors for them that had been oiled into compliance and said good morning in five different levels of sincerity because he didn't have time to check which tone matched which person. He liked two of them immediately and decided to be competent in front of the third. He fixed a sudden tantrum in the Year 4 dip taps and stood by in the corridor while the lead inspector stopped at the safeguarding board and nodded in that way that suggested boxes were being gently ticked. The children were unnerved for the first hour and then remembered they had small lives to get on with, which was a relief to everyone.\n\nAt breaktime, a girl from the singing club snuck up to him with the stealth of a cat and asked if they would still meet later. \"Just humming,\" she bargained, eyes large, as if humming could be smuggled under the inspection radar. He considered the timetable of the day, the plank of policies, the width of the corridor and his own capacity for mischief, then nodded. \"Humming in a whisper,\" he said, and she grinned like the strike of a match.\n\nThey hummed at lunch, nine of them with biscuits they had not technically been allocated by any system that would hold up in court. It sounded like a kettle not quite ready to confess, and it made the gym store feel conspiratorial and safe. He liked that they were doing something gentle and possibly illegal, which is the best category of things in schools if you are careful. When an inspector passed in the corridor and peered in, he raised a hand and said, \"Repairing echo,\" and she smiled properly because she was human and once sang alto in a choir in Cheltenham.\n\nOfsted left with a verdict that could be described as tidy and the staff drank tea in mugs that had been acquired at summer fetes and glared victoriously at the photocopier as if it were an enemy vanquished. Mrs Penney thanked him in front of people, which she rationed like sugar, and added, as if the universe owed her a balancing clause, that budgets would be a problem by May. He knew what that meant without needing Nina to translate. It meant that positions acquired adjectives like non-essential and discretionary and that sometimes people who knew where things were kept were told to put them down and leave.\n\nHe found the mural had been over-painted again when he took his long way home, the YOU ARE GOLD gone in favour of a scrawl that browned at the edges: YOU ARE HERE, which struck him as both either/or and exactly right. The letters sagged a little, but then so did he in the right light. There was a new tag underneath that looked like pool balls scattered in a triangle without the triangle, and he wondered for the first time about the hands that did this under cover of night and whether they ever came to his cake sales.\n\nMr Dray knocked two evenings after Ofsted had gone as if the inspection had approved his right to appear. He stood with his cough tucked away and his hair trying to remember it existed. \"I have a spare forecast,\" he said, with the formality of someone delivering a family heirloom. \"Shipping. I recorded it for my brother who never liked the nights and then he died and I kept the habit, and, well. I've got one left over, if you wanted to see what my living room sounds like.\" Tom could think of no answer that sounded less than sentimental and more than adequate, so he made tea and carried it upstairs where the carpets muffled worries and the furniture was arranged like it had been given instructions by a person who trusted corners.\n\nThey listened to the shipping forecast in the odd reverence it commands if you let it. It had been dropped into the room from another age and sat there smelling of salt you couldn't actually smell. Tom knew the names because he had borrowed them in the nights when he wanted syllables instead of thoughts, but hearing them with Mr Dray had altered the weight of them; Viking, North Utsire, South Utsire, Cromarty, Forties, Bailey, Fair Isle, Faeroes, Southeast Iceland. They were incantations that did not pretend to fix anything but had the decency to try. \"I did the radios once,\" Mr Dray said, eyes on the patch of wall that had been scaffold for a different life. \"On ships. Men with hands like spanners saying words into boxes and hoping the air had learned to listen. You can sing at the air if you teach it. Took me too long to work that out.\"\n\n\"I sang to a wall in Tunbridge Wells,\" Tom confessed, relieved to have a man in front of whom admissions could be made without fuss. \"A woman told me I had used space correctly. It felt like being told I'd cut up an onion properly and being moved to tears at the same time.\"\n\n\"You'll be careful,\" Mr Dray said, in the voice of a man who has deployed his ration of advice in fits and starts across too many years. \"The light makes people think they are saints or thieves. Most of us are electricians, really. Wires. Circuits. Fixing the bit that made the thing go dark.\"\n\nTom went home from the forecast feeling like he'd been allowed to touch a book in a museum. He slept badly because Ofsted had dislodged a weight he had been using to hold the furniture still, and now things were shifting again. He dreamed of doors with signs on them that changed when he blinked. OPEN morphed to NOT YET and then to WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING and then to PLEASE, which he supposed was a fair representation of his heart.\n\nThe day of Goldilocks in Space brought in grandparents who smelt of mints and optimism and siblings whose knees were made of questions. The donkey-ship rolled into the hall with a solemnity nobody had anticipated and then refused to turn left at the point where it was critical to turn left. Tom coaxed it as if it were a nervous dog and the audience clapped in that defusing way people do when a child forgets a line and someone in the third row says, Oh love, and everyone decides to love them. The play was a delightful catastrophe, which is to say it did the important things and none of the unimportant ones. Goldilocks discovered oxygen and sat on a geologically unwise chair and the Captain of the spaceship learned about porridge viscosity, and Tom moved behind the curtains like a man doing small honest miracles and felt himself in his element in the dark.\n\nThe cake sale made the corridor smell like every Thursday had decided to stand still and be grateful. The brownies were the kind of sticky that arranges peace treaties, and Gary's card reader failed in ways that made him swear softly and invent new forms of contactless that involved eye contact and hope. An old lady from the hospice appeared with a twenty-pound note that she crisply flattened on the table and a story about a lad in 1978 who had sung Danny Boy during a power cut and made all the babies sleep. By the end of the hour they had raised enough to buy new songbooks and a pack of biscuits that could calm small armies, and Tom took the money to the office with an expression he reserved for carrying hot liquids.\n\nIt was in the middle of that small domestic triumph that the email about budgets turned into a meeting that had the feel of a weather warning you could smell. Mrs Penney sat with a document printed on paper that knew it was not enough, and behind it was a table that had borne many hurried lunches and occasional weeps. \"We have been asked to model scenarios,\" she began, which is the sort of sentence that kills appetite. \"One of the scenarios is that the caretaker role goes from full-time to half-time. It is not the one I like. It is the one that has been put in front of me by a man with smooth shoes. I am telling you because I prefer to keep loyalty between us and not test it.\"\n\nHe watched the paper in her hands because it was easier than watching her face. He felt the familiar tightening of the day at the edges, the way it does when someone has lifted a glass and you realise it's you and the world will watch to see whether you will spill. \"You need a full-time person,\" he said, hearing the ridiculousness of stating the obvious with a logic that wanted something better than obvious in response. \"The pipes don't go part-time and neither does the glue. Children break things on a schedule that mocks calendars. You need two of me most weeks and a spare on Tuesdays.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said simply, and there was a fatigue in her voice that was not about sleep. \"I will fight for you. I may not win. You will not be blindsided, whatever happens, because I will not have that. There is a possibility in here\"\u2014she tapped the sheet as if it were a recalcitrant animal\u2014\"about moving you over to the trust's big site as a facilities assistant. It would be more money and less community. I do not know if it's the sort of thing that would keep you upright.\"\n\nHe thought of glass doors and lanyards that didn't have the right weight. He thought of a place where a singing club would be a form to fill rather than a biscuit to share. He thought of the river and the corridor and the janitor's cupboard, which smelt consistently of yesterday and had taught him to trust repetition. \"I'll think,\" he said, and she nodded because she knew that this was his way of shouting.\n\nThe mural had acquired a thin figure in chalk when he walked past it that evening, a personified stick man holding a broom like a standard and a speech bubble that declared, WHO CLEANS UP THE STARS. He stopped and laughed, then looked around to see if the artist was leaning nearby, acting like he didn't care. A boy who might have been sixteen with a face that had not yet found a category lurked by the bins, pretending to be married to his phone. Tom held up a thumb and the boy shrugged in that capacious way teenagers have, and then smiled at the ground which, in teenage language, is often a yes.\n\nNina sent a message that made his phone light up like a sensible promise: Come up Saturday. I have roast. Also a friend I want you to meet who is not a romance, so calm down. He calmed down and said yes and then spent fifteen minutes catastrophising about trains before remembering that people had been catching them before phones had learned tricks. He looked at his bedsit and made a list in his head of the objects he liked as if he were saying goodbye to them, which was absurd and instructive. The teapot. The potato peeler with the nick in the handle. The post-it with his name. The feather in his wallet that hadn't flown but had consented to be carried.\n\nSaturday in Gravesend brought Nina's kitchen, which had been tamed into a place where jars knew their names. She wore an apron as if it owed her money and ignored the roasting pan's complaints. The friend turned out to be a man named Roland who ran something at a community radio station and had hair that had committed to being two styles at once. He talked about microphones as if they were pets and invited Tom to come on a late-night show to talk about songs that had saved people if he wanted, which felt like the kind of temptation you could accept without losing anything you couldn't afford. Nina poured gravy with the determination of a general and told Tom he looked handsome, which in her mouth was almost always a dare to disagree. They ate and argued about trains and he told her about the scenario plan and she swore like a Christian and put more carrots on his plate. After tea, Roland played him the jingles for his show and Tom smiled through them because there are parts of modern life you have to submit to with grace to get to the parts that nourish.\n\nHe went home on a train that paused at stations long enough for him to decide if he lived there. He watched small allotments glide by in their diorama earnestness and thought about growing things that didn't ask to be big, which was what he had been trying to do in his cupboard of a life. He fell asleep for six minutes and woke with the picture of a tap in his head and felt a tenderness for it that made him laugh to himself, and the woman across the aisle smiled at him as if she saw the joke.\n\nThe week decided to be long and succeeded. On Tuesday the pipe behind the Year 1 cloakroom remembered how to explode and did, and there was a small river down the corridor before Tom could make it into a stream and then into a sulk. He waded in his socks because there wasn't time to bother with anything else and the children watched him like a man in a nature documentary and started to narrate him in whispers. A small boy in wellies asked if this was like the Medway and Tom said yes but nicer, and the boy walked away with the satisfied air of someone who had just had geography become personal. He called the plumber and the plumber was a man who treated emergencies like opportunities for anecdotes, and the two of them got the pipe to stop telling its life story. He wrung his socks out in the sink and felt heroic in the way that matters.\n\nIt was that afternoon, while his socks steamed quietly on the radiator in the cleaner's cupboard and he was barefoot in his boots like a fisherman of corridors, that a woman from the trust arrived with an expression like a policy. She wore a coat that didn't crease and smelt of a perfume that tried to be neutral. \"Hello,\" she said, locating him with her eyes as if he had been an item on a list and she was pleased to have found it. \"I'm here to have a chat about flexible deployment across the trust estate. Can we talk in your\u2026 office?\"\n\n\"My office is a cupboard,\" he said, with undefensive pride. \"You will have to fold.\"\n\nShe folded elegantly and declined a chair because the chair made excuses. She explained what he already knew in longer sentences, and then she asked the question that had been humming under the others. \"How attached are you to Pilgrim's?\" she asked, and he tried to answer without the melodrama of a man who writes songs for pipes. He told her the truth, which was that he was attached as a person is attached to the mug he drinks out of every morning, and that sometimes the mug is chipped but your hand has learned the chip and to ask it to accept a saucer would be rude. She looked at him in the way of people who are both taking notes mentally and checking their hair in their head. \"We will be pragmatic,\" she said eventually, which meant nothing and everything. \"I appreciate your\u2026 local capital.\"\n\n\"Kira says I'm more of a lowercase,\" he said lightly because it was that or say a thing that would not help either of them. They left it there because sometimes you must, and she took her coat and her smell away and he stood in the cupboard with his socks attempting sainthood and sang one line into the mop so he wouldn't swear.\n\nThe radio show with Roland happened on a Thursday that smelt of wet newspaper. The studio was small and industrious and filled with pieces of equipment that had opinions. Roland gave him headphones that made him feel like a man about to be important and a mug that said Tea Before Talent. They talked between songs about the way music makes rooms decide to behave, and people called in with voices that had been softened by midnight. A lorry driver by the Dartford Crossing told him that he sang to stay in his lane when the rain fought him, and a lady called Eileen offered that she had sung to her geraniums for thirty-seven years and nobody had died yet, which must count. Tom sang a little because it would have been rude to turn up and refuse, and the microphone was the forgiving kind that finds something good even in a voice that trembles. When they played the shipping forecast at the end because Roland had found a recording for him, he closed his eyes in a room not built for closing eyes and felt for a moment like all the names belonged to him and none of them stuck.\n\nHe expected to be embarrassed at hearing himself when he got home and wasn't, which made him suspect that perhaps he had turned a corner and not noticed. He went up the stairs and paused at Mr Dray's door because the shipping forecast had done that thing where it rearranges the furniture of your chest. He knocked and waited and got nothing. He put his ear to the wood and heard a quiet that was louder than the shipping forecast ever was. He tried the handle because boundaries are real until they're not and found it not locked. He said the man's name the way you do when you don't want to frighten it and walked in.\n\nMr Dray was on the floor in the place where the carpet had given up long ago, a man who had watched the weather for others and now needed his own weather reported. Tom didn't think of the right things. He thought of tea first because he was English, then he thought of calling the ambulance because he belonged to a century that had taught him a number, and then he was doing both at once and somehow his hand was on the man's shoulder, which felt like a sensible place to put a hand. The phone made its endless questions and he answered like a man who had practised in movies. He spoke in metres and breaths and kept his own voice quiet because there is nothing more panic-making than someone else's panic arriving to join your own.\n\n\"Sing,\" Mr Dray said unexpectedly, his mouth doing the work his chest could not. It wasn't a theatrical request. It was diagnostic. Tom sang because of course he did, not loudly, not the way you sing to rooms, but the way you sing to a baby that hasn't decided about the world yet. He chose something with a tune that didn't ask anyone to climb and made two notes do the work of six. The ambulance came with the displeasure of professionals who have seen too many floors and gathered him up and took him into the night with a speed that felt like rudeness and respect both. Tom followed as far as the curb because men like him don't get to ride in other people's emergencies unless they are invited, and then he stood a long time and watched a patch of tarmac learn silence again.\n\nThe hospital smelt like hope and ketchup. He sat in A&E on a chair that had opinions and waited because he had nothing else that would help. A woman with hair like a question mark asked him what the relationship was and he said neighbour and it came out like brother because sometimes that's the same thing. He texted Nina because you text the person who will put the thing into a box you can carry, and she told him to ask for an update every hour even if the desk told him no because the trick with hospitals is to be politely present. He did as he was told and was told very little and considered himself lucky because the telling had not been bad. He went home at three when the receptionist turned the lights up slightly in an attempt to make everyone go home without saying the words, and he slept the way people sleep who have to take their dreams in sips.\n\nHe told Kira in the morning and she swore beautifully and made him a coffee that could have done masonry. He told Gary and Gary said he would go and sit in the hospital for him as if waiting could be outsourced, then went anyway because some things are not determined by language. He told Mrs Penney and she was brisk and kind and told him to go in an hour late because she trusted him not to stretch an hour into a day. He went to St. Pilgrim's to tell the mop and the hinges and then he went back to the hospital and found that Mr Dray was mended enough to be cross. They spoke in the way men speak when they intend to cover later with jokes what they feel in the instant. Tom left with a small list in his pocket\u2014milk, bread, a particular kind of apple\u2014the way people leave altars with candles.\n\nThere were emails waiting at home because the world is poor at moderating itself. One was from the trust with a preliminary schedule of meetings where his role would become a line weighted by numbers. One was from Marianne with a suggestion of dates in July for a television thing that would require him to be filmed painting a fence he hadn't planned to paint. One was from someone who had seen him on Roland's show and wanted him to sing at a wedding in August in a marquee that would probably pretend to be waterproof. He said yes to the wedding because he liked the idea of singing to love while it tried to dress itself without catching its hem, and he wrote to Marianne to say that if they were going to film him, they could film him moving chairs in a way that would make his back feel seen. He wrote to the trust to thank them for sending the document and asked if he could send them a list of things that go wrong in a week that aren't on a spreadsheet. He did not receive an answer that day, which did not surprise him.\n\nThe school summer fete arrived with bunting that looked like arguments settled for the afternoon. There was a tombola manned by a PTA stalwart with eyes like a hawk and a cake stall that had discovered that paper plates were a lie. The caretaker had been asked to set up the tables, then asked to run the tug-of-war, then asked to judge the pet talent show, then asked to be at two places at once and had agreed to all of it with the absent courage of a man who likes to be needed more than he likes the idea of sitting. His singing club had a slot on the small stage that had been borrowed from the Scouts and he had rehearsed them until they were bored and hungry, which was the correct amount. They sang The Water Is Wide because of course they did, and they did it like a group of nine children with wider ranges than their ages, and the parents hummed and so did a man who might have been a distant uncle and so did a woman from the hospice who had come to buy a jar of jam and stayed for a chorus. He looked out and saw not the Assembly Hall but the exact corner of the field where the clover had decided to try again, and he felt, more than thought, that this might be the proper use of his voice.\n\nHe went home that night sun-tired and full in that way fetes do to you when the bunting has been taken down and the grass bears the imprint of tables. He put the cash box on the table with its strawberry magnet and its plaque and its feather and it looked like a shrine to small civic duties. He poured himself lemonade and stood at the window and watched the evening do its tidy folding and thought of the teenager with the chalk and the stick man and wanted, quite suddenly, to write on walls. He did not because he was a caretaker and the job is simple and confusing: you clean up after things, but you also decide what mess is worth keeping. He made a list of repairs in his head and it sounded like a song and he laughed out loud because sometimes sentences do that.\n\nIt occurred to him, in the days after, that there might be a way to fight for his job that didn't involve shouting at people in coats. He started to gather stories like bolts. He wrote down the time he stopped a pipe from telling secrets to a corridor. He wrote down the afternoon a child who didn't speak much had told him her father sang badly and it made her feel safe. He wrote down the morning he had found a burnt plug just before it could become a lesson in fire and gratitude, the evening he had held a teacher's hand in the storeroom while she pretended not to cry because a relationship had decided to end without consulting her timetable. He wrote down the hum. He wrote down the way corridors were thinner on days when the rain couldn't decide, and how a man with a mop could make them wider. He wrote down that he sang and that some days the song fixed things he couldn't reach. He wrote all of it in his own handwriting because he trusted it more than fonts.\n\nHe took the pages to Mrs Penney and put them in front of her like a practical offering. She read and did the thing she does when touched, which is to clear her throat as if there had been dust. \"This is not a petition,\" she said, which puzzled him until she smiled in that two-thirds way that had become their language. \"It's better. It's evidence.\" She took the pages to a meeting and left them there like a helpful ghost. The man with the smooth shoes read and did whatever men with smooth shoes do when confronted by a list of small things that threatened to make their big things look silly. Nothing changed that day. This is not that sort of story. But the shoes might have scuffed at the edges, and in July when the trust proposed the part-time line, a governor who had carried his own list with him to adulthood argued until the letter of offer acquired the phrase to be reviewed in twelve months, which is not much but it lets a man breathe for another winter.\n\nOn a Thursday that might have been August, he stood on the bridge and watched the river shrug and thought about water he couldn't name. He had a wedding in a marquee on Saturday and a hospice corridor on the Thursday after and a girl in Year 3 whose mother had promised to bring her on Wednesdays for the club because it had become the thing they shared that didn't cost a miracle. He had the trust meeting in September where his job had to be translated into money in a room that had never met a corridor with a leak. He had Kira at the pub who had started to hum while she polished glasses and stopped apologising for it. He had Gary who pretended the internet didn't matter and then made it do what he wanted when it was useful to him. He had Nina who could turn a roast into a manifesto and had promised to come down for the arts week and heckle gently. He had Mr Dray who had returned to his chair like a man who had reupholstered his existence and now found it adequate, and who had forbidden him, on pain of derisive snort, to bring him a fruit basket.\n\nOn his way back past the mural, there was a new phrase, neat and almost shy beside the chalk outlines: YOU ARE HERE, WE ARE HERE. He ran a finger along the R like a man checking that paint had dried and then walked away because the wall did not need him to bless it in public. He went up the stairs to the bedsit and the hinges congratulated him for not falling down and he sang one verse to the teapot and one to the mop and one to the part of himself that still thought he needed permission. He lay on his bed and looked up at Norway and thought about what to do with the next long corridor the world would offer him, and he slept before the answer had a chance to make a mess.\n\nThe wedding was on a farm with a marquee that sweated lightly and an aunt who had commandeered the buffet with an energy that suggested she had been waiting her whole life for her canap\u00e9 moment. The bride had a laugh that did not ask anyone to behave and the groom cried in a way that improved his face. Tom sang where he could be useful, which was at the bit between speeches and dancing when people's attention wanders like sheep. He sang The Water Is Wide because the couple had asked for a folk song and then, because the bride's grandfather had requested it in a voice that could still turn a room, he sang a verse of The Parting Glass, which he had once thought belonged to other people but discovered, in that moment, belonged to anybody willing to mean it. The tent breathed and the fairy lights considered him without judgement and a child fell asleep under a table and he felt tired in his spine and happy in his feet. He took his envelope money with embarrassment and then accepted it like a grown man accepts pay, and he gave half of it to the hospice on Monday because he'd promised himself that when he earned with his throat he would pay his debt to the corridor.\n\nBy the end of summer the singing club had a song of their own about St. Pilgrim's that rhymed glue with through in a way that redeemed both words. They had asked to perform it at assembly and had been advised by Mrs Penney that the world was not yet prepared, and then she booked them for five minutes on the last day anyway, which is how she does kindness without denting her reputation. They made posters by hand because printers are not to be trusted, and Kira came in her day clothes and Gary stood at the back pretending to fix a socket and Mr Dray sat in the aisle with his radio ear turned on, and for five minutes a school hall tilted toward the right. After, in the corridor, the children said thank you in voices that didn't quite know where to put their new bigness and Tom said you're welcome in a way that didn't make a fuss, and Sandra cried because she does and then laughed at herself because she also does that.\n\nSeptember went back on, as it always does, like a cardigan that smells of pencil cases and rain. The trust meeting happened in a room that had a carpet designed to dissuade comfort and a water cooler that made confidential noises. He brought his pages and his stories and his list of repairs and wore his shirt that had been careful for him in Tunbridge Wells. They discussed headings and figures and the meaning of essential and in the end the compromise was a promise dressed in a formality; he would stay in place with the threat of being redistributed hovering like weather, and there would be a review, and he would be invited to contribute to the long-term facilities plan as if his hands had been suddenly noticed by the plan's eyes. He left with fatigue that wrapped itself around his ribs and with a small laminated card that asserted his expertise, which he put in his wallet next to the feather because both things needed safe keeping.\n\nHe walked home along the river because even when life is mercilessly practical, the Medway will do you a favour if you let it. The water was not doing anything impressive and he loved it for that. He breathed and tilted his head like a man listening for train announcements and heard only air that had been through lungs before, and he was grateful. He turned towards Finnerty's and the bedsit and the shipping forecast that would declare its small sovereignties later and the doors at St. Pilgrim's that would swing tomorrow without taking offence, and he thought, with a steadiness that surprised him, that whatever having a chapter meant, he had one and it was his to keep or misplace as he liked. He decided to keep it, and he decided to keep it with other people, and the decisions, for once, felt like turning a screw until it held and knowing when to stop.",

                              "content": "Autumn fell into its habit of pretending to be winter early, the way some people try out a haircut before they've made up their minds. The Medway wore a shawl of mist that didn't keep it warm, and the mornings had a crispness that made keys drag on their ring like old bones. St. Pilgrim\u2019s returned to its palette of navy and grey and mud, and the corridors remembered how to smell of wet coats and ambition. Tom swore he could hear the building brace, small adjustments in pipes and frames as if an orchestra had lifted instruments to their chins and settled before the first note. He did the same with his day. The singing club met on Wednesdays in the gym store and on Thursdays wherever there was a plug that hadn't been claimed by a laminator, and in between he fixed things with the devotional cheer of a man who has given up on miracles and begun to trust ritual.\n\nThe mural had been repainted decisively and then embellished sheepishly. YOU ARE HERE had sprouted a neat additional pronoun: WE. Beneath it the stick man with the broom had been joined by a stick woman with a bucket and a crown, and somebody had drawn a figure with a microphone and a key ring the size of Saturn. Tom took this as evidence that the teenager with the phone and the surrogate shrug had either been busy or had acquired allies. He began to look for the boy deliberately on his way home and found him twice and pretended, both times, that he was not looking. Their conversation blossomed the way teenage conversations do with adults they have not yet decided are police: sideways, over time, and with an emphasis on weather.\n\n\"You draw?\" Tom asked eventually, in a tone he reserved for questions he was willing to watch die ungathered.\n\n\"I design,\" the boy replied, without arrogance. \"I only draw when the wall's right. Can't waste lines on bad wall.\"\n\n\"That wall's had so many coats it ought to have a winter wardrobe,\" Tom said. \"I'm Tom. I fix things.\"\n\n\"Jay,\" the boy offered after an appraisal that lasted a beat longer than comfort. \"I make them worse and then prettier. The council hates me in the abstract and uses my photos to look current. It's all right. Everyone has to be a hypocrite somewhere.\"\n\n\"You want to paint scenery that won't wash off in the rain?\" Tom asked, surprising them both with the speed of the offer. \"Year 2's got space left in its galaxy, and my donkey is holding out for his close-up.\"\n\nJay's mouth did something that might have been almost a smile before he remembered himself and stole the expression back. \"Yeah. Maybe. Paper lies beautifully if you treat it right. I could make your stars for you. And your planets. Proper rings, not those stupid hula-hoops people do.\"\n\n\"Done,\" Tom said, as if he had just signed a treaty that would bring peace to a corridor.\n\nThe trust wrote to say that the review would be in twelve months and that the phrase flexible deployment would acquire a working definition, which is the kind of future that doesn't fit nicely into a mind. Tom printed the email because he wanted to hold it in his hands and feel its unhelpfulness. He folded it and unfolded it and put it under the strawberry magnet, then took it down because the magnet made it look like something you keep on a fridge to keep hope fresh. He wrote instead on a card the sentence Nina had given him to memorise and kept forgetting: There will be another day to fight, and perhaps a better one. He placed that under the magnet and found the strawberry's frivolity reassuring.\n\nThe weather pivoted in a way that had not been announced in any forecast Mr Dray had played for him. Rain practiced for two days and then turned up to see what it could get away with. The river swelled and walked itself up the banks like a visitor who had found the spare key. The school whispered about sandbags, the way people whisper about old flames, half disapproving and half eager for the drama. Tom spent a morning in the caretaker\u2019s cupboard making piles make sense, putting torches with batteries and batteries with their right friends, checking that the mop heads were not planning mutiny. He took delivery of three dozen grey sacks with a willingness that startled the man who had to carry them and wrote sand with a marker on them in letters that were too neat.\n\nIt began with a trickle in the playground where the drain had never quite learned its lesson. It continued with a suggestion of damp where the Year 1 corridor joined the cloakroom, and then the suggestion became declarative. At eleven, a teacher whose calm had been made in a forge knocked on the cupboard door and told him that the river had decided to make an appearance by the back gate. He stepped outside into air that had gone greenish with worry and saw the water testing the school like a burglar checks windows. He called the council with the efficient despair of someone who had called them before and then he called Gary because if you wanted something turned into a temporary solution with a lifespan of six hours and a story to dine out on, you called Gary.\n\nBy noon the world smelled of wet cardboard and effort. He and two TAs who had known him long enough to mimic his jokes built a low defence that looked like ambition and hope had been translated into grey. The children ate lunch in classrooms because the hall was flirting with puddles, and there was a hum in the building that was not singing and not panic but a third thing that coordinates bodies without arguing with hearts. Kira arrived with a flask the size of a small moon and six cups that had once been mismatched and were now, through use, a set. Gary brought a dehumidifier on a dolly and swore that he had bartered it for a bag of 10p pieces and a favour owed from a man who had no name, which meant he had bought it in cash from a man named Stuart. Mrs Penney moved along the corridors with her hands in her pockets the way a general keeps his behind his back, seeing the whole.\n\nAt one, the water asked for more and the sky gave it. The back classrooms looked out on a new pond and the sound altered in a way that made everyone 5% more aware of their knees. Tom lifted chairs like he was rescuing cats and thought not at all about what would happen if water decided to be a tenant. He spoke to doors and meant it; Keep this line, he said to one that had always fancied itself a leader. Be the hero you were made to be, he said to another that squeaked when nervous. He didn't sing because singing tears the membrane that keeps calm intact and he needed that membrane today, but he hummed a line that had nothing to do with rivers and everything to do with not dropping things. Jay turned up in a hoodie that had aspirations and calm on his face, looked at the river, and shrugged in an appraising way. \"I can get pallets,\" he said. \"From behind Aldi. They owe me for art. I\u2019ll build you a catwalk.\"\n\nThey built a catwalk, because of course they did, and for an hour the school walked on wood and felt like a ship remembering itself. In Year 3, a child decided to test physics by crying loudly enough to cause weather, and Tom sat on a low chair and explained that rain was not personal and that sometimes water needed to see other places and would return, and the child doubted him correctly and then put her head on his knee as if she had chosen to trust the chair instead. When, at two, the headteacher from across town rang to see how they were managing, Mrs Penney stood in the office and said words that would reassure a person who needed to be told that the world could still be organised, and Tom watched her and felt a surge of admiration for a woman who could tell reality how to behave respectfully.\n\nThe water stopped where it was supposed to stop. It considered an inch, had the grace to think about it, and then held. The day lengthened in the particular way days do when they have been asked to hold a little too much. Parents came early and later, depending on the river and the buses, and the school became a cloakroom for anxieties and umbrellas. Tom lifted children over the last mind of water and made a joke about pirates until it became boring and then stopped because there is nothing more infuriating than a person who continues to be funny after the joke has retired. At three-thirty, when the bell sounded like it was working for its living, the corridor hum happened again, unbidden, in the place where the floor had dried and the light made a rectangle on the tiles. He stood in it with his key ring heavy in his hand and didn't sing because it would have been theatre, and instead he checked the sandbags with the gravity of a man who has invented a new hobby.\n\nWhen the last child had been claimed and the last teacher had sighed in relief and guilt, they sat in the staffroom with tea and the high of getting away with something. Gary discovered biscuits somewhere and rationed them with cruel wisdom. Kira took off her eyeliner with a tissue like a flag of surrender and tucked her feet under her as if she had been born to that sofa. Jay hovered near the door and pretended to look at his phone and then sat because nobody told him not to. Mrs Penney said thank you without frill and without calling it anything else, which made the thank you weigh the right amount. Tom looked at his hands and found them river-dirty and good for nothing except more useful things, and he felt tired in the way men feel tired when they have done the thing they can do and kept something from breaking that didn't have to break that day.\n\nThat night the Medway sulked and then pretended it had never had ideas above its station. The world outside the bedsit smelled of clean-up, that particular odour of defeat and victory mixed. Tom washed his hands for longer than necessary and the water seemed to forgive him for having sworn at it earlier. He knocked on Mr Dray's door out of habit born of the day's edges, and the older man opened wearing the cardigan that had had to learn his shape. They listened to the forecast together without speaking because sometimes you borrow another man's habit to put your own away. Cody, Fitzroy, Biscay, German Bight, the names came, more confident and less wet than they had any right to be given the evidence outside. When it was done, Mr Dray coughed with dignity and pointed his chin at the wall. \"Never trust a low that calls itself manageable,\" he said, and Tom laughed with such relief he worried he would cry.\n\nJay turned up the next day with a roll of paper that had been saved from a bonfire and an authority over tape that would have impressed the council. He had brought two friends who behaved like apprentices in a guild they didn't know they'd joined. They filled the stage with a galaxy that wasn't real but could be believed by anyone who looked up tired after a day of adding and subtracting. Jay worked fast, the kind of fast that comes from not planning and having planned secretly for months, and he let Tom cut stars while making conversation an optional extra. At the end, when the donkey-ship rolled out through a field of perfect planets, Jay made a sound that could have been approval and photographed it like he was stealing a moment to sell later to himself in a poorer mood.\n\n\"You do singing,\" he said then, as if the information had been presented and verified by a third party. \"I don't sing. I draw loud, though.\"\n\n\"You drew us a sky,\" Tom said. \"Always handy for a song.\"\n\n\"You're weird,\" Jay said, with accuracy and something like fondness, then tightened the tape on a corner and disappeared in the way teenagers can when the room thinks it has more time to say the right thing.\n\nThe Wednesday singing club doubled because children have a nose for good rooms. It was still only twelve, but it felt like a choir if you squinted and believed. They stood among the vaulting poles and the crash mats and made a sound that understood the space. Tom printed out lyrics with a font that refused to apologise and introduced a new song because a club needs to believe it can produce novelty or it will lose momentum like a bike that has decided to become a chair. He had written it in his head while counting sandbags because that was when the mind agreed to multitask, and it was about hinges, because of course it was, and about doors that know your name and about the particular mercy of a corridor that curves and still gets you somewhere. The children laughed when the door got a line, and then they sang it carefully because laughing and careful often travel together in the young.\n\nHe wrote to Marianne when the rain had given up, because the television people had begun their sniffing for feel-good, and told her about the river and the sandbags and the pallets from behind Aldi and the catwalk and the hum, and suggested gently that if the region liked people who were part of their places, perhaps their cameras could point at the people who had done the saving with their quieter hands. Marianne phoned the next day, sounding as if she had enjoyed putting something obvious over a small flame for just long enough to call it cooking. She said she wanted to send a crew to film the singing club and the painted stars, and he said all right, but that the club was not television-friendly in the way shows like; it was full of small pauses and jokes that require context and biscuits. She laughed and said biscuits are universally legible and promised no staged humming. He believed her because she knew what he meant about the light making people think the wrong things were important.\n\nThe hospice wrote on paper with a logo that had flowers that managed to be sincere, and asked whether, at the Christmas fair, he would sing while the raffle destroyed the flow of time, because people are gentler with their money when there are carols. He had a complicated relationship with carols because they were songs he had learned at an age when he thought songs came with rules for being a person and things had deteriorated afterwards, but he said yes because the corridors there had held him up when he leaned, and because he wanted to be the kind of man who sang between mince pies and a secondhand jigsaw. He told Nina, who told him not to be manipulated by anyone with tinsel, and then said she would come and wear a jumper that could light a village.\n\nNovember brought a cold that didn't announce itself with sneezing so much as with the increasing unwillingness of batteries. The hall lights took half a second longer to remember their brilliance, and the photocopier, which was powered by demons and acronyms, demanded sacrifice. Tom oiled and buffed and tightened and discovered a new squeak in the Year 2 cupboard that sounded like a toy horse confessing, and he found himself liking it because it was a noise he could solve. He bought plasters with cartoons on for a child who had become fascinated by the edges of doors and the consequences of distraction. He taped up a poster for the Christmas fete that had been designed by someone enthusiastic about clip art and considered writing 'and music' under 'mulled wine' with a pen, then decided that smugness is often the enemy of community and let the poster be.\n\nHe went to Gravesend two Sundays in a row because Nina needed him to build a shelf and because she had a cackle that improved roast potatoes. Roland came round with an armful of records and a suggestion that Tom come back on the radio to talk about songs people share at funerals, which was either ghoulish or practical and possibly both. Tom agreed because it would mean saying out loud things that people say to him in corridors and bringing them into a room where everyone could pretend to be alone together. He helped Nina put the shelf up and pretended to know how to use a spirit level with more confidence than he had, and when it was done she looked at it and declared it useful and then hugged him in the manner of a person who is fixing something that cannot be fixed but wants to mark attendance.\n\nThe day the television crew came back for their small where-are-they-now, the school smelled of glitter glue and new cardigans. The producer with the ponytail turned up with ginger biscuits which meant she had been promoted by a minor god. They filmed the club from a respectable distance and caught Keir making a beat under The Water Is Wide that was inappropriate and perfect, and they recorded Jay painting a small comet on a corner nobody would film properly, and no one told him not to because the law of classrooms is that a boy with paint can be contained by kindness more efficiently than by rules. Marianne asked if Tom would sing a bit to camera and he said he would hum if the room did, and then the room hummed and the camera looked pleased because it had caught an accident behaving itself.\n\nIt was in the middle of that humming that the trust woman arrived again, smelling of compromise and good handbags. She stood in the doorway and watched for ten seconds longer than was necessary and then caught herself and began speaking in bullet points. The review had been pushed to spring because budgets had decided to become pumpkins at midnight and the trust wanted to see how winter was going to treat the pipes, she said, turning even water into an agenda item. She spoke about estates strategy and the need to develop talent across sites, and he heard the irony and decided to step into it.\n\n\"Let me teach caretakers how to listen to buildings,\" he said, surprising himself with the audacity of suggesting anything that wasn't defensive. \"Let me run a morning somewhere with a room of people with mops and give them a list of tricks that aren't on the spreadsheet. How to make a door behave without breaking its pride. How to speak to radiators in a language they respect. How to get chalk off walls without making the wall give up. How to be part of a school without being swallowed.\"\n\nShe blinked because it is not every day a man with glue on his cuffs presents you with a curriculum. \"We don't have budget for training,\" she began, by reflex, and then stopped because there was a camera capturing a humming that might make donors feel generous at breakfast. \"But we do have staff conference day in February. I'll put you on, if you send me a title that makes it sound like we meant it all along.\"\n\n\"Care of Fabric,\" he said immediately, because he'd been giving his sessions the names he wished buildings had. \"Fabric meaning cloth and thread and bodies. Fabric meaning walls and doors. Care meaning both. I'll bring biscuits. No PowerPoint. Just hands.\"\n\nShe laughed despite the part of her that wanted to be immune to charm and wrote it down, and later he would tell Gary that the first lesson in advocacy is to wait until a person is standing near a camera and then suggest a thing that sounds like you've only just thought of it even if you've been rehearsing for days.\n\nDecember found him at the hospice with a song list that he had made the way you make tea for unexpected company. He sang carols without making them fancy because some songs don't appreciate your embroidery. He did Once in Royal not because he had loved it as a child but because his mother had sung the alto line over the top by accident, and because he liked the way the third verse let you breathe. He sang The Parting Glass because a woman with a hat that had seen war asked for it and because the room had needed a song that didn't square its shoulders. He sang the hinge song because a child had gravitated toward the keyboard and hit middle C with dogged devotion, and the hum happened in the corridor without him asking and he watched the nurse with the forget-me-not touch her wrist as if the flower had warmed. Nina wore a jumper with a reindeer that blinked and shouted at him in whispers when he had almost cried near the raffle table, which is what you pay sisters for.\n\nBack at St. Pilgrim\u2019s, the Christmas production arrived like a bus that had been expected at four and rolled in at half past five with apologies and a horn. There were shepherds with attitudes and angels with hair decisions and a donkey whose ship had learned to turn left if coaxed in a voice that promised biscuits later. Jay's stars glittered under lights they had not been designed for and got away with it. The singing club stood at the side and discovered a new talent for being ready and then waiting, and Tom stood behind the curtain and held his breath while the Year 2 narrator declared that space was like a porridge you had to stir with a rocket and was pummelled gently by three grandmothers who could not cope with the logic. The audience clapped in the right places and laughed in the wrong places and loved everything because everything had been made by hands they recognised. After, in the hall, Tom mopped glitter with a resignation that had learnt to be fond, and told the door that had been the hero that it had performed beyond specifications and would be thanked appropriately with oil in January.\n\nThat night, upstairs, Mr Dray produced from a drawer a Morse key that had been kept alive by tea and habit. He placed it on the table with a reverence that made the lamp stand still. \"I can't use it anymore without dragging ghosts up with it,\" he said, flatly and without pleading, \"but it ought to be used or it will sulk, and sulky instruments haunt houses. Learn it. Or take it to your club and let them pretend to be ships at sea. Teach them what a dot feels like. Teach them how to ask for help with a finger.\"\n\nTom took it the way you take a small animal someone trusts you with and found that holding it made his back straighten. He tapped once, twice, idiotically, and Mr Dray made a face that a better friend would have anticipated and softened. He showed him the rhythm for S and O with a patience that made the table like him more. They sat and tapped, and the room became a room where other men had sat and tapped and hoped for ears, and Tom thought about rhythm as a kind of watching that makes sound behave.\n\nThe singing club learned Morse in the way children learn anything under the guise of drama. They sent messages across the crash mats with their fingers like spies whose passwords are biscuits, and Tom didn't tell them that one day they might need to tell a room they were not all right without frightening their own voices, because that was not a thing you teach in a gym store. He asked Jay to paint them a simple code on the back of a piece of scenery, and Jay wrote dots and dashes with the precision of a man who enjoyed systems but only in private and only if they could be defaced later for art. Keir, who had been born with a rhythm machine where other boys store their disinclination to tidy, tapped a backbeat under SOS and then had the grace to stop when Amara gave him a look that could cut wire.\n\nTwo days before term ended, the trust sent round a flyer for the staff conference day in February with a schedule that had been assembled by a person who believed in verbs. Care of Fabric sat at eleven o'clock in a font that did not apologise for itself next to sessions on trauma-informed pedagogy and teaching maths through dance, which made Tom both proud and anxious for the world. Nina rang to say that she had found a secondhand suit for a tenner and would be bringing it down because you ought to have something that makes you walk differently for days like that, and he told her he would consider his walking and she told him he had better consider it out loud where she could hear. Kira threatened to stand at the back with a placard that read HE'S FUNNY REALLY and Gary offered to heckle with love and then, unexpectedly, told him he wasn't allowed to fail because he'd already bought a notebook for the quotes.\n\nOn the last morning before the holidays, he arrived at St. Pilgrim\u2019s to find a note in the pigeonhole that had not come through the usual channels. It was folded over neatly and had his name in pencil in a hand that made its letters sit up straight. Inside there was a drawing of the corridor rectangle of light and a cartwheel that somebody had smudged with a thumb, and underneath, in their new careful writing, the words Thank you for the hum. It was not signed because sometimes thank yous don't need to be attached to a throat to be true. He stood in the cupboard and held it and thought about the part of his job that would never go on a spreadsheet and never make it into a policy and never be used as evidence when the trust brought its forms to town, and he thought about the day in February when he would be allowed to tell other caretakers to listen to walls, and he felt a closeness to himself that was not vanity but something that resembled fidelity.\n\nThe mural had changed again, because the wall never allowed itself boredom. WHO CLEANS UP THE STARS had acquired an answer written in a different hand: WE DO, WITH OUR COATS ON. It made him laugh in the street in a way that made two older ladies turn and approve. He reached out and touched the edge of the chalk R with one finger as if checking if a cake was done and then thought about telling Jay and decided not to because some compliments were better overheard than delivered. He went into The Oast House because Kira had told him there would be sausage rolls only fit for men who had faced rivers, and found her and Gary and two TA's and a parent governor and the postman and a child who had won a raffle prize he couldn't carry, and for half an hour he sat and let other people talk while he ate, and the grindcore of the coffee machine tried to fight the hum of the room and failed because this was a place that had been taught by use how to hold sound without bruising.\n\nIn his bedsit that night he laid the Morse key on the table next to the feather and the plaque and the strawberry magnet's stubborn cutesiness, and the arrangement looked like a museum of a person who had found uses for both the beautiful and the blunt. He tapped S, O, S like a man checking whether a song worked upside down, and then he tapped, tentatively, OK in the code he had been taught by a man who had made himself into radio, and there was a sense in the room that something had answered. He laughed at himself and put the key away in a drawer with a reverence that was only half pretending, and then he lay on his bed and looked at Norway and thought about flood water and the sound children's humming had made in the corridor and the way sandbags can persuade a river to consider its options, and he slept because it had been earned.\n\nChristmas did its capable thing and moved on, leaving behind oranges with redundant cloves and strings of lights that had become discussions. January walked in with its hands in its pockets and the wrong shoes, and the school returned with a cheer that was at once real and minimal. He stood at the doors on the first day back and told them they were beautiful, because he had promised himself to do it on days when it was not obvious. The hinges responded with a confidence he chose to attribute to compliments rather than new oil, and the hall, when he switched on the lights, chose to cooperate without drama. In the gym store, the crash mats waited with the stoicism of soldiers, and he felt sudden gratitude for things that keep their shape when asked to more than usual.\n\nOn the second Wednesday of term he brought the Morse key to the club and told them they were going to learn to say hello and I'm here and can you hear me and sorry, not yet, and somebody asked if there was a code for biscuit and he told them he'd invent one. They tapped and giggled and tapped like people inventing a language that adults would feel left out of, and he found himself thinking that if he had been given this small instrument at nine he might have stayed in certain rooms longer, or at least not blamed them for failing to notice he was in them. He glanced at the doorway and found Jay leaning there, pretending to look for attention and finding it, and asked if he'd paint them a code to keep, and Jay nodded as if asked to memorialise something the council would never read.\n\nWhen he walked home that night the river behaved itself and the air had given up on being dramatic. He paused on the bridge because he didn't like letting days turn into other days without consent, and watched the water look like a difficult essay that had finally been handed in. He thought about February and the staff conference and about the trust's careful vocabulary and about the boy in Year 3 who had lost a tooth in assembly and held it up like a white flag and about a woman at the hospice who had sung three words with him and then stopped because that had been exactly enough. He thought about what he could tell other caretakers that would not feel like showing off and would not be a waste of their tea, and it occurred to him quite calmly that he had a thing somebody else might need. He held the thought as if it were a bolt he intended to put down somewhere safe, and then he went home and told the doors goodnight, and the doors said nothing, and he trusted them.",
