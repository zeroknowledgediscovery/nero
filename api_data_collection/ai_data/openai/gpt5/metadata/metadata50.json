     "novel_text": "They said the last trolls died when the old roads were ripped up and the iron bridges were welded quiet, that they starved without tolls and songs. They lied. Or maybe greed invented a new kind, a city-grown thing with the knotted patience of weeds forcing through concrete, the same green insistence in the pupil when the pupils are shot wide by the promise of money. The sort of creature that wraps itself in our language and smiles from the dark of a drain.\n\nJana learned to keep her breath silent. She could slow each draw and hide it inside the rumble of a freight elevator three streets over. She could nest in a culvert while traffic passed above, face painted dull with the powdered spoil of old brick and a veil of spider silk. The splurge-gun rested against her shoulder, easy, feather-balanced, no recoil. She had built it in pieces sourced from markets that existed between districts like dreamland alleys. The purple cartridges looked like children's cough syrup poured into bullet sleeves. She liked that. The decoy, the toy. The misdirection of color.\n\nThe first boy had walked right into it. He was not a boy, she corrected herself, he had a driver's license and a belt with a copper buckle that said TOMMY in a font that wanted to be bigger than his waist. He carried his jaw forward like men in their first suits. He had the arrogance of never being preyed upon. He laughed into his phone. His skin was perfect where he shaved in the mornings and he thought he was alone. All the things a hunter listens for.\n\nJana's bare feet touched water and her toes curled with the cold. She let him hear the coin roll. The oldest lure. A little brass disc twirled and dropped on the walkway, a bright sound with a history in it. He turned his head. He bent. The bridge overhead sent down a cough of rust-dry grit like a retail snow globe. Jana shot him in the throat.\n\nThe splurge hit and bloomed. Purple, silly, quietly devastating. It gripped, it climbed the nerves, it sang underneath the skin with its proprietary hum until his laughter got trapped behind it like a fly behind a screen. He tried to shout. He gurgled instead. Not poison. Never poison. Jana didn't like poison because it wasted property, and a living, frightened man always negotiated more tenderly than a corpse. She stepped up from the culvert, squinting through the damp, thumb at the trigger for control. One more pull to catch his wrists when they flailed. See? Now we can talk. Now we can transact.\n\n\"You'll keep your eyes on me,\" she told him. \"No turning. Blink if you understand. Blink.\"\n\nHe blinked, quick, reptile, overexcited. She smiled, a small tired curving. \"Good. I like a quick learner. Here's the number. Five hundred is the floor. If you try to bargain me lower I add attachments you don't want. Blink if you have it.\"\n\nHis pupils widened. He blinked once, then furiously, then his jaw trembled with the effort of words. Jana held up a rectangle of black that hummed when presented to a bank's invisible machine. \"Hold it with your teeth. Good boy. No, don't bite. Keep your mouth gentle. You can pick the account; I already picked you.\"\n\nShe always picked by the clean lines. The ones who wore their money like cologne: you could smell it even when it wasn't on the skin. He worked for a contractor that worked for a larger contractor that washed old stories off new buildings. He had a deposit due.\n\nShe watched him move his head and watched the transaction occur. A tickle in her palm when the device read a figure. Five hundred settled. Jana felt that old ache behind her right eye, the ache that took her back to kitchens where she counted bent coins in weak light. Greed and need were not the same voice, but they sat at the same table. She kept them apart by force.\n\n\"You did well,\" she said. \"There is one thing more. Don't move.\"\n\nShe took the razor from the pouch she wore on a cord across her chest. It was older than the gun, older than most of her. The handle had belonged to a barber who sang half-remembered opera between clacks. The blade had been honed flat until it could split a hair and name the strand it belonged to. Jana dipped it in the rainwater in the small steel cup she carried and flicked it dry. She touched the man's cheek with the back of her fingers. He rattled with the need to be brave. She moved the razor.\n\nFirst his jawline. Then his cheeks. Clean, slow, no cuts; she was gentle. She took his eyebrows last and that mattered to her; it was the sign. When he cried he cried silently but the sound was everywhere, like the river against the pilings. She shaved him until he looked new, like the stone figures in the civic hall that had never been named, those anonymous martyrs soft at the edges. She wiped his face and kissed her thumb and pressed it to his brow. See? Done. Paid. Marked.\n\n\"Next time,\" she said, \"you will recognize the story when it calls. It's an old one. Pay the toll.\"\n\nThen she melted back into the culvert, into the threads that tied the undercity together, and the hum in the cartridge settled into quiet small fizzles. He would be able to move soon. He would tell them a troll took his money and shaved him. He would prove it with a mirror and a mouth that made the story ring wrong.\n\nBy dawn the river had forgotten him. He, however, remembered every small detail of the splurge's touch, and between his mirror and his phone's black eye, the story traveled.\n\nThe first time Sergeant Twyning saw one of Jana\u2019s marks, it was on the cover of a convenience store magazine. A glossy youth, pretty-mad, with the headline: TROLL TERROR? HAIRCUT OF SHAME! The words made something old move in Twyning, a muscle that hadn\u2019t been trained in years. She lit a cigaret she was technically not allowed to own inside the Brethren building and let the first breath of smoke fill the small square between her sternum and her coat.\n\n\"Put that out,\" said Jallo from the door, but he didn't mean it, or he meant it as a courtesy, a line from a script. The Brethren like their scripts. They like their white halls and the recycled air and the way the doors seal your intentions in.\n\nTwyning had been a caretaker so long that caretaking had become a bone habit. You spool fiber through a city and somebody has to keep the spool from snarling. The district used to call them wardens; the newer term sounded gentler. Caretaker. Like they might be hired to water your houseplants. It made people easier when the whistles blew. She wore it well because she could speak to grandmothers in stairwells and they fed her soup, and she could stand in front of a riot with the same spoon and tell them no. Under the badge she wore the breath of someone who used to be a soldier and never got an honorable write-off. There was a little stitched prayer in her pocket that a woman in the Brethren had given her the day the water came up over the third step.\n\n\"That thing again?\" Jallo thumbed at the magazine, his face thin as a spade, his hairline drawn back in near-perfect geometry.\n\n\"It's not a haircut,\" Twyning said, hearing her voice heavier than she meant. \"It's a mark. It says: I found you. It says: you can't hide in your face.\"\n\n\"God. You actually read it.\"\n\n\"I can read something without believing it. And my job is to read.\"\n\nJallo leaned on the doorframe. He wore the white of a junior less like a promise and more like a borrowed shirt, too big, rumpled where he thought no one would see. \"Care sent a notification out,\" he said, \"about somebody in Drain Four. Lads keep coming to Guards with their eyebrows gone and their savings light. It's been a week. Command says we keep it to property crime, for the time being.\"\n\n\"Command says a lot of things. What does Command call it when someone breaks the law in a way that makes people start to speak a language they thought was folklore.\"\n\n\"I think that's called 'Branding.'\"\n\nTwyning made a sound that meant almost a laugh. \"Where's the lad?\"\n\n\"Down at First Aid. They say he's embarrassed but safe.\" Jallo's smile was a thin coin, warmed by someone else's hand. \"They say it's a prank. The word 'prank' came up nine times.\"\n\n\"Nine's a spell number,\" Twyning said. \"Did they tell the press?\"\n\n\"You think we control that now? The press were waiting when we fetched him off the rail.\"\n\nTwyning folded the magazine and tucked it under her arm like it was evidence, which it wasn't, not technically. It felt like it had weight anyway. She put her cigarette out against the door metal in a gesture of apology she did not feel. The Brethren liked their walls clean. They liked their caretakers tidy. She went where the boy was.\n\nHe looked like he wasn't used to needing help. He was in the big chair with the machine that huffed under him, bright at the edges with the smell of antiseptic. He had the look of a person who had once been hit in the face by a tree: stunned, angry with himself for not moving, ashamed of the way the bruise refuses to be private. He covered his head with a crocheted blanket that said PROPERTY OF CLINIC in letters so cheerful they might have been singing.\n\n\"You Sergeant Twyning?\" he said, looking at the floor.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. She pulled a chair out of habit, positioned herself so her knees framed his. \"I'm here to make sure that if someone did this there can be consequences, and if you did this there's nothing further to bother you. I've seen more serious.\"\n\nHe laughed. It came out as a hiccup. \"It's not serious. It's stupid.\"\n\n\"Stupid hurts more than serious,\" she said. \"Tell me. All of it. Tell me exactly. I won't make a face. I have practice.\"\n\n\"I don't want to tell you.\"\n\n\"That's the thing with me. I keep asking.\"\n\nThe boy picked at the blanket edge, the yarn already fuzzed from other hands. He tried to make the story small. It insisted on being large. Twenty minutes later he had told her about the coin sound, about the purple foam that held him without bruising, about the way it felt like being sung to wrong. He told her the money, he told her the card, he told her the razor. He cried when he said she took his eyebrows last. Then, embarrassed by his tears, he laughed again, strangled, and said: \"I look like an idiot. My mates are calling me Mr. Clean. I shouldn't have told my mates.\"\n\n\"You'd be worse off if you'd told nobody,\" Twyning said. \"There are men and women and in-betweens who go home with their throats cut because they don't want the world to know they let somebody touch their neck. Your shame is not a duty. Not here. Try not to pay it.\"\n\nHe sniffed. He wiped his face with the taken edge of the blanket. \"You're not like the others.\"\n\n\"I'm older than the others.\"\n\n\"You look like one of those statues. No offense.\"\n\n\"None taken. They haven't shaved me yet.\"\n\nHe made a face, then looked up as if he had heard his own courage misbehave. \"She was... she wasn't like I imagined. Not big. Not small, either. She talked like, like she had a job and this was part of her job. She told me what to do. And I wanted to do it. That's the worst of it.\"\n\nTwyning thought of the magazine. The froth of it, the merchandise. She thought of the old story that a troll takes coin and hair. She thought of the bridges still standing in the parts of the city where the high water hadn't eaten the roads.\n\n\"Did she have a name?\"\n\nHe hesitated. \"She said, 'You can call me Jana,' like a joke. Like the name itself was a trick.\"\n\n\"It probably is. Names have work to do.\" Twyning stood. The boy flinched and then apologized for flinching. \"You'll be all right,\" she said. \"You may feel a little haunted if you liked the way she organized you. That goes away. Eventually. Try not to buy anything from anyone online who says they can fix your eyebrows with a kit. If they can fix them, they'll also steal them.\"\n\nHe laughed like a cough. Then his face went quiet. \"They said it's happening all over. Messages from my cousin in the North. Some guy by the docks in Santiago. A girl in Haverfell who shaved her boyfriend to prove she's brave.\"\n\nTwyning looked at him. \"You're very observant. You'll live longer than your mates.\"\n\n\"They're going to do a challenge, aren't they? On their channels.\"\n\n\"They are. They will. And they will be sorry for awhile and then they'll pretend they weren't.\"\n\nShe left him and stood in the hall. The light there had the washed-out look of winter mornings even in summer. She put the magazine in a bin marked for paper. She took it out again. She went to her small desk in the room that had once been a closet for mops and had been upgraded to an office when the Brethren decided caretakers should have windows. Her window looked at the hospital. She looked back. She had the feeling of being looked at from below.\n\nJallo came in without knocking. \"Your eyebrows look great, if anybody asks.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Go away.\"\n\n\"Command says to put patrol on the bridges, show presence.\"\n\n\"Presence is a substance,\" she said, \"and has its uses. But if this Jana is what I think she is, she lives in the angles and tunnels. Put a uniform on a bridge and she'll put a poster of his face on the drain wall with hearts around it.\"\n\n\"What do you think she is?\"\n\n\"A troll,\" said Twyning. She tasted the word. It was not stupid on the tongue. \"I think she is a way of making money. And I think she's ritualized it because ritual robs us of our shame.\"\n\n\"Command says not to use fairytale terms in reports.\"\n\n\"I'll be sure to call her a serial mugger with signature.\"\n\n\"You can't help yourself, can you?\" Jallo loved her because she made him feel the long line behind him. Loved her like a child loves a stubborn old dog it can't keep for much longer. \"There's something else. Someone leaked a video. The shave part. It's on everything.\"\n\n\"Show me.\"\n\nHe showed her. It was a smear, a surreptitious capture from someone's window across. Jana was a blur with a careful hand. The man was a geometry of stiffness and trembling. The sound was a river and a song in a language nobody claimed. The camera shake made it worse, more real, less. At the end Jana put her thumb on his brow like a blessing and the camera stopped. The comments rolled like rain.\n\nTwyning watched the numbers climb. She felt the little bones in her ear grind where they had been broken in another life. \"They'll love her,\" she said. \"They love neat violence and people who believe in their work.\"\n\n\"They're already making jokes. The police in New Attlee are saying it's a fraternities thing. Pranking. Hazing.\"\n\n\"And in a week,\" she said, \"someone will die.\"\n\nHe looked like he didn't want to know she was right. He always looked like that, which was one reason she kept him around her. She kept people who were not yet convinced that she could predict ugliness.\n\n\"How do we find her?\" he said. \"How do you catch a story.\"\n\n\"It bites its tail because it doesn't know where else to end,\" she said. \"We put a question in front of it and see if it answers.\"\n\nTwyning didn't go to the bridges. She went under them. She went in uniform, because uniforms had certain rights and caused certain confusions, and because she didn't like to pretend. Her boots remembered the slope of the old milky stones. Her hand remembered the way to lift a curtain of vines without breaking the stem where it fed. The water smelled like money and old laundry. The iron under the bridges whispered, rust pitched high like a child's singing.\n\n\"You're too old for this,\" she told herself. \"You're too old to chase girls into pipes.\" She went anyway.\n\nThere were marks. They were\u2014 what: notches? Tokens? The way children mark how tall they've grown against a wall until the wall is a graph of hunger. There were little thumbprints of purple on brick, half-hidden under the chalk tags of teenagers and the condolence notes they write to themselves when a boy goes in the water and doesn't come out. There were slick places where feet had worn a path, but the city is full of those. The river is a legible book if you know the script.\n\nUnder the fourth bridge, the one \u0441alled Angel's Crossback for a soldier who once died there twice in the stories, she found a thing. It was not a big thing. It was a blade-steel hair that had been tied into a knot that couldn't exist. She held it on her palm. It flashed when it caught the lane of clean daylight. She did not know the trick. She pocketed it. She looked up and saw a child on the rail watch her, and the child's mouth shaped the word: troll.\n\nShe made the kid a face that said don't be afraid and go away now in the same breath. The kid went. The river smiled, full of teeth.\n\nBy the time the sun angled home the news had shifted. In New Attlee a woman called Torolina decided to shave her boyfriend live while a purple balloon hung over her bed \"for color.\" He struggled. He laughed. The laugh snapped off and the feed ended and his throat had a line across it when they found him. They said it was an accident, or a fight, or an accident of a fight. The throw of the story was already wrong.\n\nBy midnight there were copycats in Cape Town and in Kyiv and in Kentish New. Most were pranks. Some were worse. An ocean away a boy with a new splurge-gun printed cheap in a kitchen made a mess of his friend. The death counter, the one the stations will not admit to but watch with feral attention, changed number with a little, almost-joyful click. Exponential is a word we give to the way things mate in darkness. It looked like that.\n\nJana watched it all from a room that was once a locker space for a pool that had been emptied of water when the city started rationing. She liked dry pools. They reminded her of gods who had lost their patience and gone away. The tiles echoed her steps. She had a mattress under the lifeguard chair because irony suited her between jobs. There were little lines on the wall where the chlorine had wept down over a decade of hands and laughter and bodies and then stopped. She warmed her hands over the battery heater and counted her money. She wasn't much for counting except when counting meant she would not have to listen to any man's explanation ever again.\n\n\"You're a little famous,\" said a voice from the doorway, knowing exactly how to say both little and famous at the same time like a pain. Jana did not startle. Mavery was a thin woman with a face like a well made of scars and sweetness. Mavery sold devices and listened to frequencies. She knew where the markets went when they wanted to be private. She had found Jana a cartridge supplier and a way to know when a bank got anxious. She walked barefoot even in glass.\n\n\"You shouldn't use doors you don't own,\" Jana said. \"I might take a razor to you and you'll have to eat through a straw.\"\n\n\"Promises,\" Mavery said. She came and crouched and peered into Jana's pile. \"So many blues and warm oranges. You could buy yourself a car.\"\n\n\"I don't like cars. They make promises they can't keep.\"\n\n\"You could buy yourself a pardon.\"\n\n\"They sell those now? The Brethren really are pivoting.\"\n\nMavery smiled. \"You scared, little troll?\"\n\n\"Of whom.\"\n\n\"The ones who love you. They'll ruin you first, then they'll turn on you. They're not your friends.\"\n\n\"I don't have friends.\"\n\n\"I am your friend.\"\n\n\"You're my supplier, and my conscience that keeps telling me to change the color of the cartridges so the Boy Scouts don't die by accident.\"\n\n\"You listen every other Thursday,\" Mavery said, stepping on the butt of one of Jana's jokes and flattening it. \"I brought you a copycat count. It's going to give you a tickle.\"\n\n\"I don't care.\"\n\n\"You do. You plan on a territory. You plan on a harvest. You don't want a boy with a sugar-water squirt gun tipping your markets and making the mothers take weapons classes.\"\n\n\"Let the mothers,\" Jana said. \"They're known to be good shots.\"\n\n\"You're sour because the boy you shaved yesterday had prettier skin than yours,\" Mavery said, patient. \"Here. It's already in the high hundred. The death pieces are small, but the trending is jagged. The algorithm thinks you\u2019re a dance.\"\n\nJana did care and hated that. She took the device and read the little lines. \"Little birds will always think they're hawks.\"\n\n\"I love your metaphors. They're like knives that forgot to be buttered.\" Mavery sat on the edge of the lifeguard chair, swinging her legs like a child. \"The Brethren put a woman on you.\"\n\n\"No, a woman put herself on me. The Brethren don't have that kind of taste.\"\n\n\"Sergeant Twyning. Caretaker. They call her the Quiet Stalker. Not to her face. She walked a battalion out of a ditch once with a broken loudspeaker and a pocketful of chalk. My friend says she used to talk to snipers like she was their aunt and they none of them shot her because she did the thing with the voice.\"\n\nJana, against her will, felt curiosity shift in her mouth. \"The thing with the voice.\"\n\n\"You know the thing. The voice you had when you told the boy to blink.\"\n\n\"Stop watching me through other people's windows.\"\n\n\"I can't. You're good tape. Also if the mothers arm themselves like I told you, it will be better if there is a woman out there who knows how to make them put the guns down. You're a selfish thing, Jana. But not all bad.\" Mavery reached into her tunic and brought out a wrapped bundle. She unwrapped it like a gift and the unwrap itself made content. \"Here. Found you a different purple. This one stains like shame. Lasts forty-eight hours. Washes off when they cry under hot water. The chemical bond is intrusive and it smells like grapes. Which is disgusting but\u2014\"\n\n\"Good,\" Jana said. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for my own sense of humor. The boys will smell like grapes for two days and their lads will make jokes about wine and they'll want to die.\"\n\n\"I don't want them to die.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Mavery said. \"But they are dying now. And not because of you. Because they want to be you, or they want to be yours. That's how it goes.\"\n\n\"Don't turn this into a fable,\" Jana said, but she held the cartridges like a child holds her mother's lost hairpin.\n\nNight pressed on the empty pool and all the sounds were magnified. Out the window, a siren wrote its long sentence along the block. Jana sat cross-legged and thought about bridges. The thing with the voice. She had learned it from watching nuns talk a drunk down from a steeple. Not her nuns. She had no nuns. But the city offers you almost everything if you are patient enough to accept its gifts out of harm's hand.\n\nTwyning did not sleep so much as do little sums with her eyes closed on the bed that pretended to be a sofa in the caretaker room. She wore socks because the floor conducted cold like a gossip. In her mind she laid string. Bridge to drain. Coin to bank. Blade to ritual. She made the shape the story had agreed to be and then she set the shape against other shapes and waited for the friction where they overlapped. That is where you set your trap. She turned and the little prayer in her pocket scratched her stomach through the fabric and she didn't mind. She imagined offering a sandwich to a girl with bare feet in the wet and the girl not taking it. She imagined war as a song. Different wars. Same song. Exponential. No one rehearsed for those parts; they learned in the chorus and then walked out as soloists with their mouths open the wrong way.\n\nShe woke to the sound of the wrong alarm: not the building, not the hospital, but the city-first emergency that only the caretakers could hear, a tone calibrated to taste like copper in the throat. She sat up and reached for her jacket. Jallo stumbled into the door.\n\n\"Angel's Crossback,\" he said, too pale. \"Two of them. Shot with purple. One's blueing, the other's saying the word 'grape' like it's a prayer. The press got there before we did. The kids threw things at the paramedics.\"\n\nTwyning stood. She did not bother a mirror. She pocketed the little impossible hair without thinking about it. \"By now they're throwing at everyone,\" she said. \"Call the water company and ask them to shut the bottom gate by the river.\"\n\n\"That makes the Lower Blocks flood.\"\n\n\"No, it makes them damp. But it turns Angel's Crossback into a dead end and if you want to catch a person who moves in tunnels you take away the tunnels one at a time.\"\n\n\"You'll get fired.\"\n\n\"I've been fired in every uniform I've ever worn. Then they hired me back because the people they replaced me with were good and I am not good, I'm useful. Do it.\"\n\nHe went, swearing, loving her. She went, walking like a person with nothing to prove. When she reached the bridge the air was thick with bad questions and lights that made everyone's fear look like a fashion show. She walked through the cordon. She knelt by the boy who could only say \"grape\" and smiled as if it were their first day of school and she was handing him a pencil. He stopped saying it and he said, \"She smelled like penny.\" He meant copper. He meant the taste of the alarm.\n\n\"Good lad. Very good. Remember that you are not the worst thing that happened today. Remember that you survived.\" She stood. She made the shape of her trap by moving her men. There were not many men. There were women in orange and elders in brown. There were kids on rails filming her so they could edit her into a witch. She let them. Witches were sometimes right.\n\nThen, because she needed something old to wake, she went under, into the drain, into the dark that had her name scratched in it from twenty-four years ago. The water company liked her enough to do as she asked. The lower gates trembled and closed. The current softened. The undercity held its breath.\n\nJana felt the water slack and turned her head like an animal in a forest looking toward the tree that had changed its mind about falling. She had been planning to slip under the river and pop out five blocks away like a magic trick. Now the trick's floor had vanished. She smiled without fixing it. It had been a while since a caretaker did something clever. \"Well, then,\" she said to the air. \"We will be polite about this.\"\n\nShe took her splurge and checked the gauge. Where she crouched the wall sweated. There were names written in soot, old ones and new. People practiced their letters underground. The words did not like the light.\n\nThe first time she saw the woman coming it was a silhouette with a haircut that had never been shaved against its will. The second time it was a voice that didn't bend to echo. The third time it was a pair of eyes that had a capacity for sorrow in them large enough to float a house. Jana, who never apologized for what she was, felt that apology-like pain in her chest settle and look up.\n\n\"Jana,\" the voice said, and did the thing with the name: not asking, not accusing, just laying the cloth. \"We've been walking toward each other all week.\"\n\n\"Sergeant,\" Jana said. \"If I come up you'll do that thing where you make all my money look silly.\"\n\n\"I will take you somewhere safe and I will keep idiots from copying you with real weapons. I will make a room where people can't shoot you with their phones. I will try. And then I will listen, and then I will charge you. These things are all true.\"\n\n\"There's a tax on everything,\" Jana said. \"I'm the one who says that.\"\n\n\"Taxes make civilizations. Tolls make bridges. You and I might agree on more than you think. Please come up.\"\n\n\"Please,\" Jana repeated, delighted. \"Do you know how long it has been since anyone with a badge said please.\"\n\n\"I say it all the time. Everyone hears it as an order. They do what they were taught.\" Twyning stepped closer. There was fluid in the drain a hand's width deep. She put her foot in and made no face. \"Mavery told me you are better than the people who love you. Mavery is sometimes right.\"\n\nJana did not change expression, only her pupils. \"Mavery talks.\"\n\n\"Mavery sings. You know that.\"\n\n\"Why should I come up. The world is better when I am under it. The city is more itself. It has its story again.\"\n\n\"The story isn't yours,\" said Twyning, very simply, although nothing had ever been simple in her mouth. \"You made a mark so others could find you. Now they've found the mark and they think they own it. They are shaving their friends and killing their friends and broadcasting sorrow that looks like advertisement. You are greedy. I know greed. So be greedy for the shape of your story. Don't let them ruin it. Come up.\"\n\nJana thought of the boy who had said Mr. Clean and then had cried like a child with soap in his eyes. She thought of grape. She thought of scarcity. She lifted the splurge a fraction, not to shoot: she wanted to remind herself what she was. She did not lift it further. Her bare toes curled with the wet.\n\n\"I came here to shave a man who beats his wife,\" she said. \"I do good, sometimes, sergeant. I've been told. He has a tattoo of a dog on his shoulder and he calls it courage.\"\n\n\"You do good as a side effect of your wants. That is better than never doing it. If you come up, you can point me at him, and I will go to his house with a sandwich in my pocket and a warrant in my shoe. I will do my job. And you will do yours, which is\u2014 I don't know yet. You'll tell me. Come up.\"\n\n\"You're very sure I won't shoot you in the throat.\"\n\n\"I am not at all sure,\" said Twyning. She took one more step, into the thin water, into the list of names that had never been read out loud. \"But I asked. I said please. And I would like to hear you say my name because then we will be more equal.\"\n\n\"Equality is a tax, too,\" Jana said. She smiled the soft smile that has undone men in wars and weddings. \"Twyning,\" she said, tasting it, making it hers. \"Twyning. It tastes like old rope.\"\n\n\"It tastes like salt,\" said Twyning. \"Come up.\"\n\nThe sound from above shifted, subtle as a breath. Jana watched it in the way light fractured on the drain-water surface. A crowd leaned wrong. A child shouted. A glass bottle rolled. She felt the copycats up there, practicing their swagger, folding their faces into a mask she had made with her fingers. She made a choice. It didn't feel like anything at all. Choices seldom do.\n\nShe came up but not as surrender. She walked into the mouth of the drain like a woman stepping through a curtain backstage. The hole made a frame around her and the camera lenses drank her hard. She didn't care about the camera lenses because the only pair of eyes that mattered were five feet from her, watching like a woman watches a tide. She lifted the splurge and felt the crowd flinch collectively and she smiled to show her very small teeth.\n\n\"The man with the dog on his shoulder,\" she said. \"He lives in the brown Muscovy under the damp graffiti of a name that was once 'Lice' and then 'Nice' and then 'Lice' again. His wife wears pink slippers and she keeps her hair long because she thinks it will save her from something. I am greedy. I want to take his eyebrows. Your turn, Sergeant. Do you like pickles on your sandwiches. I don't. It's a flaw.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Twyning, who had the sense to accept a gift as a gift and not make it tax at once. \"I will take the pickles off for you. Put down the gun so I can give you your sandwich. I'm a woman of my word.\"\n\nNobody heard that line except the two of them. The others heard the words but not the promise because everyone was editing their own story in their head at that moment. Everybody wanted to cut a version where they were brave and righteous and one day their kids would ask what they did and they could say: I was there at the bridge when they took the troll out of the drains. Someone's mother cried because she thought her son would be the one to die today. Someone's father wondered how much the clips would sell for in the old coin markets. The water smell got into the hair of everybody present and they would keep catching it when they walked past clean rooms for weeks.\n\nJana shifted the splurge. She put it on the ground. She kept the razor. She never didn't. She took the sandwich out of the air when Twyning gave it. It was the worst sandwich she'd ever eaten. It was almost perfect. It tasted like someone who knew that you survive on bread when bread is all there is decided there should also be a sweetness, once in a while, to remind you of your teeth. She took a bite and the grape smell rose from her hands where the cartridges had leaked a little. The wrong kind of memory. The crowd laughed and gagged and shouted and delaminated like a bad poster in rain.\n\nBehind them, downriver, the number changed again on a screen in a room that didn't admit to existing. A producer clapped and a politician practiced a look. A girl in a country that was a republic and a monarchy and a colony all at once tied a razor to a string and spun it until it sang. The death count climbed and the angle of the climb steepened because that is what angles do when everyone agrees not to be boring any longer.\n\nTwyning stepped close enough that Jana could have cut her if she wanted to. Jana didn't. \"I will walk with you,\" the sergeant said. \"I will not hold your arm because you are not my prisoner yet. But you are also not mine to lose.\"\n\n\"I'm nobody's,\" Jana said reflexively, and then swallowed the word like a bit of stale bread. \"I might be the city's. A little bit.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Twyning. \"We are all pieces they forgot to sweep after the party.\"\n\nThey walked. The cameras folded their content. The copycats watched and learned all the wrong lessons. Jallo made a hero's face because he thought it would help someone, and maybe it did. On the rail, the child who had written the word troll with his mouth pointed and turned to his brother and said, \"See? It's like when you go to the dentist. They make you open your mouth. It's not about your teeth. It's about the chair.\" And the brother nodded like that made any sense at all.\n\nBehind them, under Angel's Crossback, the impossible hair that Twyning had taken from the wall sat warm against her hip, and if it had been a story it would have woken and asked to be told. But it wasn't a story. Not yet. It was a knot she couldn't untie with a knife. It was a sign. It was a tax. It would be waiting when they went to sleep and when they woke, and everything the city invented between those hours would be, as ever, both brand-new and ancient as a toll collected in a language no one now pronounces right.They walked with a steady slowness that made the crowd\u2019s noise fold over itself and exhaust, a kind of reverse wave where expectation met boredom and turned to commentary. Twyning held the shape of the space between her and Jana like a fence made from hands and calendar pages; she had learned how to make an absence do the work of a wall. Jallo flanked them with his clipboard and his too-new boots and the kind of face a mother would forgive for bringing home a stray, and the cameras tried to sluice around his edges, but he was a better dam than he looked. When a boy stepped forward holding his phone in both hands like a sacrament, Twyning said, in that schoolroom voice that made bad choices put their heads down for a second, \u201cThank you, not now,\u201d and the boy found himself listening to a woman from a decade he had seen only in remastered clips.\n\nThe Brethren van was not a cage. Jana saw that and let herself be amused by it without relaxing. The interior was scarred white, the kind of clean that remembers filthy days, and it smelled like peppermints someone had spilled in an emergency. Jallo opened the side door and then remembered to look at Twyning to see if opening doors was still his privilege. Twyning nodded because commanding is a shared pastime when you\u2019re tired. Jana swung in without showing the blade of her foot. The splurge lay on the floor between them like a candy someone had dropped and nobody wanted to be caught picking up.\n\n\u201cNot straight to Command,\u201d Jana said, glancing out at the angle of the bridge. \u201cYou promised me pickles off a sandwich and a dog on a shoulder.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promised you pickles off a sandwich. The dog-man is an intention. Intentions need sequencing if you don\u2019t want to lose your appetite,\u201d said Twyning. She had that air of someone who had eaten field rations and could therefore hold off a hunger bawling at her ankles for an extra hour. \u201cIf we walk to Muscovy directly, the press will gild it until it stops being a visit and becomes a pilgrimage. The woman in the slippers will have to move, even if I take him. I want her to stay until she wants to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes she ever want to go,\u201d Jana said, and it wasn\u2019t a question so much as a diagnosis. She folded her legs under her on the bench as if she were in someone\u2019s kitchen. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll play your game first if you play mine second.\u201d\n\nJallo inhaled as if to declare nothing like that could be written on a form and then exhaled because he had been around Twyning long enough to know forms arrived after the story, not before. \u201cWe have fifteen minutes of privacy,\u201d he said, which meant two. \u201cCommand wants to see if you can be made to sit still. They have scripts.\u201d\n\n\u201cScripts are for boys who need lines,\u201d Jana said, not unkindly. She peered at the van\u2019s ceiling and watched a spider that had made a life there move across a field of dents. \u201cI prefer improvisation. It\u2019s cheaper. It leaves more money on the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is cheaper until it costs,\u201d Twyning said, which was the closest she would get to a sermon while the city still held its breath. She leaned forward. \u201cYou killed no one. Do you know what the count is this hour for people trying to be you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stopped counting so I could keep working,\u201d Jana said, and for once there was no lacquer on her voice. \u201cThere\u2019s a smell to it now. Grapes in hot rooms. If I could repent for a scent, I would. It\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t stupid, it\u2019s a design flaw that a thousand boys adopt because it is easy to repeat,\u201d Twyning said, and she watched the little nod Jana never gave anyone, the one she had given only to gravity. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix the scent. We\u2019ll fix the ease. That\u2019s what caretaking is. You narrow the door until the wolf can\u2019t get its shoulders through.\u201d\n\nThey pulled out of the knot at the bridge. The van took a street that pretended to be a lane and then kinked back on itself the way old roads do when they\u2019ve had to learn the shape of a river twice. The gates below Angel\u2019s Crossback were still closed. The Lower Blocks had begun to consider their damp with an offended solidarity; women in plastic shoes were moving carpets onto steps, men were carrying radios that had never been allowed to touch water. Two children sailed a sheet pan and argued about who got to be the captain of a vessel with no oars.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll blame me,\u201d Jana said, watching it all through the slit of a half-raised blind. The van\u2019s windows were smoked in a just-barely legal way; the Brethren liked to see without being seen until it served them to be seen. \u201cThey\u2019ll blame the troll. It\u2019ll make them feel old and safe and angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll blame me,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cI called the gate. I\u2019ll be the one who eats bread for a week and never sees a dessert coupon again. I have been unpopular longer than you have been paid. That\u2019s another kind of protection.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you take compliments in sandwiches, too,\u201d Jana said. She felt the van breathe as if it had lungs. The city had that trick. Everything organizes itself around breath if you let it.\n\nThe Brethren building had doors that you could open with a hand and a sentence and doors that you could only open by performing a specific shame in front of a camera. Twyning took Jana through the ones that were invented when caretaking had meant war-walking, not disease counting. In a hallway that had once been a barracks they passed a mural done in paint the Brethren pretended had always been there. It showed a woman carrying a child through water that reached her waist while men on scooters filmed her. Someone had scrawled a comment bubble above the child\u2019s head. It said a word that meant \"like\" and \"hurt\" at the same time, which was a language kids had learned without lessons.\n\nMavery knew exactly which window to meet. She leaned in at a half-open pane as if it were a cousin\u2019s gossip slot and showed her teeth the way useful women do when they want to pretend affection until someone pays them. \u201cYou made a crowd watch you be somebody,\u201d she said, very softly, and it didn\u2019t reach further than Jana\u2019s earlobe. \u201cGood tape. Bad angle. They\u2019ll think you came up because the aunt told you please. They\u2019ll write you smaller if you let them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m eating a sandwich,\u201d Jana said. \u201cThe aunt kept her word. The aunt gets two more sentences for free.\u201d\n\n\u201cTorches are being manufactured as we speak. Plastic ones. They learned how to print your splurge but it jams; the cough-syrup cheapens in heat,\u201d Mavery murmured. She let her eyes flick up to Twyning and nod very slightly. Respect where it made her merchandise move. \u201cI will dirty the circuits around Muscovy for ten minutes and make the microphones forget to be on. For this gift, I want the other purple. The one that stains teeth, not faces.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a worse person than I am,\u201d Jana said, grateful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a better vendor,\u201d Mavery said. \u201cAlso your friend. Don\u2019t argue; it wastes breath you will need later.\u201d She vanished in a fold of brick and a bad potted palm whose fronds had bruises from fingers.\n\nThe room Twyning chose was small because small rooms make men\u2019s voices drop into usefulness. No cameras. No mirror pretending to be a wall. A table, two chairs, a sink that had counted hands and tears. She set the sandwich down and took the pickles off without lecture. She poured water from a bottle because the tap had a politics she didn\u2019t want to involve in this lunch.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re famous,\u201d Jallo said from the door, and it was not flattery so much as hazard signage. \u201cCommand wants an hour. After that, if you haven\u2019t given them a story they can sell as safety, someone in a blazer taller than his authority will call this a kidnapping and we will all get demoted to counting parking meters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m allergic to blazers,\u201d Jana said, chewing. \u201cThe man\u2019s tattoo is a bull terrier. It was done in a kitchen and the ears are wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d said Twyning, and she watched the way the admission eased the muscles in Jana\u2019s throat, which had been the color of someone looking at a snake that wasn\u2019t sleeping. \u201cFirst, talk to me about the knot.\u201d\n\nThe word made Jana\u2019s mouth do the thing it did when the bread was stale but there was butter, after all. She pulled her legs up and wrapped her arms around her knees the way orphan girls never entirely forget to do, and she looked at Twyning as if giving her part of a story was not a mistake but a gift that she could charge for later.\n\n\u201cYou found one,\u201d Jana said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t ask if you hadn\u2019t. They don\u2019t show themselves unless someone deserving looks. Or else someone makes them and hopes the deserving will come.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a single hair. Blade-steel. Tied like a problem. It could not be untied without salt and time. I am short on time. I have only medium salt,\u201d said Twyning. She put it on the table. The knot sat there like a trick a child does with a cherry stem and keeps for a year as a token of dexterity. \u201cTell me this palindrome before the clock eats us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re called scumbles in my mouth because my mouth likes words that smudge,\u201d Jana said. \u201cIn the old stories, the ones I pretend not to read, trolls were given bridges by saints and taxes by devils and they drew their circle with stones. In the city, stones move, and circles become maze corners. So you tie what you can\u2019t move. Hair is good because it has memory. Knots are good because they are language and trap at the same time. You take a hair from the first three you shave. You twist them into a knot that says: I live here now. It tells the old things that you will take care of the passage and demand a toll that isn\u2019t blood. It tells the new things that there is an adult in the basement. If a caretaker finds it and takes it, the contract is reviewed. The bridge remembers that human eyes have seen it and the bargain resets.\u201d\n\nTwyning turned the knot in her palm and the memory of it pressed against the lines the way a stray cat presses its cheek against a leg to make a claim. \u201cI found it in a spot where the river stutters. It was not your bridge. Was it you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tied mine under the third, under the one that drops rust flakes like sugar. Angel\u2019s Crossback should not have had my knot. So either I sleepwalk and make duplicate leases or somebody wants me to think I am larger than I am,\u201d Jana said, and the thought pleased and then alarmed her in quick succession. \u201cThere is a kind that comes after profit. They have no receipts. They do it for the look. They tie with stolen hair. They don\u2019t pay old things with soup and songs so the pipes go angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have noticed the pipes,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cThey talk to me when I fall asleep. I thought it was age.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is age,\u201d Jana said, and she grinned like a fox drawing a culture line in frost. \u201cOf everything that is not you.\u201d\n\nJallo coughed and made a tapping gesture at his wrist which meant the Command had moved from patience to mail. Twyning ignored him with old-lady impunity. She took a breath that had been earned. \u201cWe are going to Muscovy first. We will be overpolite. We will take him to a room like this and ask his wife if she wants to sign a paper that says she is safe without him. If she refuses, we will not eat our own hands. We will leave food with her. We will leave a number that rings me, not a clearinghouse. We will remember our own weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour sermon suits you because you don\u2019t enjoy it,\u201d Jana said. \u201cTeach me your voice and I\u2019ll teach you how to walk in drains the way a cat walks on piano keys. You can stop stepping on songs that don\u2019t belong to you.\u201d\n\nTwyning\u2019s smile was a line that had seen a lot of winter and refused to apologize for its cracks. \u201cDeal. After we do this thing right now.\u201d She stood and put the knot in her pocket again because she didn\u2019t believe in leaving signs on tables where men could pick them up and think they were souvenirs. \u201cJallo, tell Command that the room we are in does not exist. Use the old code. If they argue, ask them if they have their swimming badges up to date. We\u2019re closing the gates again in ten if they don\u2019t behave.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod,\u201d Jallo said, with the helpless adoration of a clerk for a field hand. \u201cI love you when you do policy by threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never threaten. I predict,\u201d said Twyning, and they moved.\n\nMuscovy had been built in a decade that liked rectangles and forgot about wind. It held its damp like a man with a secret holds a grin, tight in the corners, wider than it wants to be. The graffiti that was once \u201cLice\u201d and had become \u201cNice\u201d and then decided to be \u201cLice\u201d again had been layered like sediment; someone had tried to scrub it at some point, and the rectangle of cleaner brick made the word louder. Two men on the stoop had the patience of people who have small jobs and wait for their small jobs to start. A woman on the second-floor balcony watered geraniums with a plastic bottle that had been a sports drink once and now was a different kind of endurance.\n\nTwyning went first because there is power in being the first to put your foot on the squeaky step and not apologize. She greeted the men without making them a threat. \u201cWe came to speak to the dog-man,\u201d she said in a voice that would have made a bouncer step back and check his list. \u201cWe have a question and a sandwich. Only one of those is for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just,\u201d said the older man, and then he trailed off because she had a way of making \u201cjust\u201d sound like a luxury nobody could afford.\n\n\u201cI can just,\u201d she said pleasantly. \u201cAnd you can just let me. That would be neighborly. What\u2019s your name so I can use it when I talk to your grandmother about how polite you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cStas,\u201d he said, caught. \u201cI don\u2019t have a grandmother here.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone has a grandmother somewhere. I will tell the nearest one and she will nod because you were raised right today.\u201d\n\nJana lingered three steps behind. She watched the way fear reduced and gathered in the doorway; she watched the room like a recipe she wanted to steal. She could have slipped past and done it the simple way: a coin and a laugh and a purple sting, a neat shaving until the ink-dog sat above blank eyes and could not pretend to be brave. But the crowd had grown on the pavement and the woman in pink slippers had her face pressed to a curtain, and Jana had decided, once, in a dry pool, that there were rules that made the city better to live in even when you didn\u2019t get to be the one who wrote them.\n\nThe apartment smelled like broth and cigarettes and a shampoo that had lied on its label. The dog on the man\u2019s shoulder had been done with a needle charmed by a cousin and an oven cleaner\u2019s courage; it was a geometry of anger, more square than a dog ought to be. He didn\u2019t look like a monster. He looked like a man who had learned to put his hands in places where they had no work to do. He looked at Twyning and measured whether her coat could be convinced to be a costume.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know you,\u201d he said, trying for a long vowel in a short mouth.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d she said. \u201cSit, please. I won\u2019t embarrass you in front of your friends if you sit and make your voice fit in your throat instead of the hall.\u201d She put the sandwich on the table and she put a paper under it that had stamps on it and she put her hands flat as if she were showing him there were no weapons in them besides time.\n\nThe woman in pink slippers had beautiful hair, and Jana, who liked hair and watched what people did with it, saw the way the woman held it across her collarbone like a life vest. She made herself smaller because she knew how to watch without turning the watched into a performance. Her razor felt light and patient against her sternum.\n\n\u201cThis is a warrant for your screams,\u201d the man said, laughing at his own wit.\n\n\u201cThis is a paper that says, in boring language, that if you have been unkind with your body in this room we can move you and feed you while we decide where kindness lives,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cIf we are wrong, you will go back to your chair and eat something your neighbor burns. If we are right, you will sleep somewhere clean and maybe learn how to make soup. You will pretend to hate it. You will be grateful in your kidneys.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the sandwich and at the slippered woman and at the engraved dog, and he put every face he knew on his own until one looked useful. \u201cShe\u2019s lying,\u201d he said, pointing without looking. \u201cShe lies like some people blink. It\u2019s a habit.\u201d\n\nThe woman moved, one inch. It was a brave inch and the room noticed. \u201cI don\u2019t lie,\u201d she said, and her voice was small but accurate. \u201cI hide. You taught me.\u201d\n\nJana didn\u2019t mean to step, but she stepped. She had never been good with other people\u2019s inches. The razor in her hand made a small silver apology to the air as it turned. Twyning saw the turn and did not flinch, because flinching would make the room sharper. Her hand went out in the same breath that a mother catches a falling cup before the water hits the rug. She touched Jana\u2019s wrist without force. Jana stopped because the touch was not an order but an information: we are being filmed by a god with bad taste.\n\n\u201cLater,\u201d Twyning said, and she meant later later, the kind with furniture moved and witnesses sent home, not the kind that means never. \u201cWe\u2019ll take him now. He\u2019ll be brave in the hallway and small in the van. You can tell me his friends\u2019 names in low voice. We do this gently because if we do it hard the neighbors will pretend tomorrow that kindness is the same as conquest, and then a boy will buy a gun in a kitchen again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour math is heavy,\u201d Jana said, and she let the razor go down. The man laughed because he thought he had won. He did not know about afternoons.\n\nThey took him without breaking the table. Jallo had his polite face on, and it worked like an anesthetic. The woman in slippers looked at her geraniums as they passed and then she looked at Jana, and there was a brief electrical exchange that had no language to carry it, a sort of handover of chores. Jana wanted to take the woman\u2019s hair into her palm and tie a knot that would hang above the threshold and make the apartment remember itself, but she didn\u2019t because she had watched too many men bless women with objects and call it protection and then demand interest. She said, instead, \u201cThere is a knot under the third bridge that knows my name. If you go there and you touch it, you can say a sentence about safety and forget it later, as a trick. If you meet a policeman and he looks like a child with a clipboard, tell him to find Sergeant Twyning. She is the one who removes pickles.\u201d\n\nThe woman smiled and the smile was a broken fence that would soon be mended because someone was coming with wire. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like pickles either.\u201d\n\nOutside, the air had moved sideways into heat. News traveled faster than weather now, but the weather was catching up. Someone had tagged the word TOLL on the side of the van with a marker that smelled like sad grapes. A boy across the street filmed the ink in time lapse and added a filter that turned everything to winter. A girl posted a challenge where she shaved her boyfriend\u2019s knee and called it kneeverse good luck. A man in a tie did a segment on facial hair as heritage. The flatscreen that hung in the lobby of the building across from Muscovy had a crawl at the bottom that said: BRETHREN NEGOTIATE WITH TROLL, EXPERT SAYS: BRAND RISK OR OPPORTUNITY.\n\nOn the way back, Mavery\u2019s dirtying of circuits held long enough that the microphones recorded their own hum and the cameras made beautiful, useless loops of light. She fell in step for half a block with the van and then peeled away to sell something to a woman who made candles that smelled like fear and productivity. She knocked twice on the panel of the van as if it were a boat she wished luck. \u201cAnother knot came undone by the docks,\u201d she said through the glass, casual as weather. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t one of yours. Somebody is making counterfeit circles. They want tribute without the tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course they do,\u201d Jana said, and her shoulders did a little roll like a dog shaking off a glove. \u201cGreed never dies. It just changes brand.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you smell it,\u201d asked Twyning. She didn\u2019t mean the grapes. She meant the wrongness. She meant the flaring edges where a story takes off its own skin and runs around causing accidents.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jana said. She put her hand over the place where the razor lay, an old habit that had begun as comfort and had become, lately, a superstition. \u201cIt smells like old sugar and cheap metal. It smells like what I would be if nobody had taught me how to ask a man to blink.\u201d\n\nCommand tried to own an hour and got twelve minutes. They sat her at a table and asked her to be contrite in public in exchange for the chance to be mythic later, and Jana found herself almost laughing because of the adjacency of the words contrite and mythic. Twyning sat to her right and said absolutely nothing, which was a trick men didn\u2019t know how to do. Explainers in tidy jackets leaned on phrases about harm reduction and exploiting the moment to teach consent and weapon literacy; one of them used the term \u201cnarrative hygiene\u201d and looked very pleased with it. Jana ate the second half of her sandwich and tried not to enquire about the price of their haircuts.\n\nIt turned while they were inside, as things always turn when you look away. A boy with a printed splurge that dripped panic in blue had cornered his friend in a stairwell ten blocks north, and the friend had done the thing that doomed friendships do: laughed too loud in a small space. The cartridge jammed and burped a bloom of foam that held and then slipped. The boy with the gun panicked because panic is a muscle teenagers can outlift, and he did something with his hand, and the stair was old, and the fall was short and fatal. By the time the Brethren room breathed that news in, a mother had already recorded her grief on three platforms and a brand had bought a hashtag that didn\u2019t belong to it.\n\nJana put her forehead on the table like a woman saying grace badly. Twyning closed her eyes. Jallo swore in a language he used only in church. Command made phone calls like a puppeteer with burnt fingers. For a moment you could hear the city\u2019s heart as if it were under a stethoscope held by a beginner.\n\n\u201cWe go back under,\u201d Twyning said at last, and she said it the way you say we go back into the burning houses with buckets that leak because that is what living here means. \u201cWe close gates where we must and open them where we must and we tell them a better story, loud. Mavery will throw dirt at cameras. Jallo will lie to a minister about resource allocation and repent later when he finds a priest. Jana will tie knots that mean enough-sit-down. And we will look for the thief of circles.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to tie scumbles to stop boys from being idiots,\u201d Jana said, incredulous and delighted because it was neat. \u201cYou want me to ritualize the exit. You want a mark they can\u2019t perform without a teacher. You think making the pattern harder will make the dance less deadly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the city wants to be sung to in its right key,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cYou have one note. It is clear. I have one note. It is lower. Between us we can make a song that isn\u2019t catchy but is hard to kill.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if the other one\u2014 if somebody like me with worse manners\u2014 ties theirs,\u201d Jana said. \u201cIf they knot with stolen hair. If they declare their bridges while I build mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we go to their bridge and we untie it with salt and we speak into the pipe one sentence until it learns who its mother is,\u201d said Twyning, and it sounded like wisdom and luck had met in a stairwell and framed each other for each other\u2019s crimes. \u201cDo you know the sentence.\u201d\n\nJana did. Every city teaches a different version, but the bones are the same. It\u2019s the sentence a grandmother says when she walks past boys with bad tattoos and wants to bless them without being accused of condescension. It\u2019s the sentence that unhooks knives. It starts with the word \u201cnow\u201d because nothing else is as true and ends with \u201chome\u201d because nothing else ever will be. She didn\u2019t say it out loud. You don\u2019t speak that one to strangers.\n\nShe stood and the room adjusted its gravity around her without complaint. She looked at the sandwich ends and considered stealing the pickles back because nothing in this world will ever completely erase spite. She tucked her razor back so it lay as it should. She took the knot from Twyning\u2019s hand and held it in her palm until the warmth woke a little bit of its lazy wanting. \u201cThis isn\u2019t mine,\u201d she said, very softly. \u201cWhoever tied it wants me to think bigger or smaller than I am. That\u2019s either flattery or a trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreed left us a mirror,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cWe will look and then we will walk away.\u201d\n\nOn the way out, in the hallway that pretended to have been a library once, a kid from the Lower Blocks that the damp had made glamorous in the way hardship often does stood in front of Jana and Twyning with a face that refused to admit to trembling. He had chalk on his fingers. He held them up like a confession. \u201cI drew a toll in front of our house,\u201d he said, his voice both proud and terrified. \u201cSo people would be good on the stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it work,\u201d Jana asked, and she crouched, and the boy saw her eyebrows and didn\u2019t look away.\n\n\u201cMy little sister tripped and didn\u2019t fall,\u201d he said. \u201cShe grabbed the banister. I think that\u2019s like paying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is exactly like paying,\u201d said Twyning, and she gave him a coin, not for the toll, but for his story. \u201cYou keep the change. Don\u2019t spend it on grape things.\u201d\n\nThe van made the shape of a long breath on the street. The river adjusted to the gates. Somewhere, on a dock with its boards written over by the feet of men who think they are permanent, a knot that didn\u2019t belong did the small cruel work that copycats do: it hummed without knowing the tune, and the hum was catchy. Somewhere, in a room that had once been a dance studio, three boys rehearsed an apology they didn\u2019t intend to need. Somewhere, in the pool with its tiles much too patient, a woman sat on a mattress and wrapped purple cartridges in brown paper as if she were mailing candy to a school, and she wished she liked pickles so she could inherit the world as it was instead of the world as she wanted to collect it.\n\nThey drove toward the drains. They drove toward the bridges. They drove toward a sentence that begins in the mouth and ends under the tongue like a secret you keep there because it is your toll to pay, every day, across every span you dare.Chapter Five\n\nThe van moved like a well-trained beast, patient even when the street snapped at its heels. Dusk made a bruise out of the sky and pressed it to the river, and the river took it without complaint because being a river means being complicit in every weather. Twyning held the plastic throat of the intercom that spoke to the gates and said a sentence too low for the microphones and too plain for the poets; the gate-keeper on duty, Rell with the gray braid and knuckles like knots in a rope, answered out of the belly of the city with a cough and a yes that had more trust than protocol would have allowed. Jana watched Twyning talk to the water as if it were a nephew that might grow up decent if someone would only stop buying it fireworks. She liked that. She liked that the old woman said please to concrete and the concrete moved its shoulder just enough to show it had heard.\n\n\u201cYour voice sits where a hand would go if there was a shoulder,\u201d Jana said, leaning back until the van\u2019s ceiling touched her hair in an intimacy no architecture had earned. \u201cHow long did it take you to find that place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree wars and a choir practice,\u201d said Twyning. She considered her laugh and rejected it because the boy had died in a stairwell while men in neat jackets arranged sympathy into paragraphs. \u201cRell, close the ship gate by Mill Fire for six minutes. Do it like you\u2019re telling a lie and you\u2019ll get caught if you enjoy it.\u201d\n\nRell made a sound that could have been a prayer or a curse and the city shifted in the knee. The van took the hint and turned itself into an alley that had once been a path for cows and weddings and now delivered pizza and men with alarms tied to their belts. Jallo was on his communicator talking to a minister who had never met rain from below; he had swiveled his face into the shape men use when they are promising that consequences are a future species, not a present animal. Jana let his words wash through her. She had a ship to board in her head and it did not float on sentences like \u201coptics\u201d and \u201coutcome.\u201d\n\nThe third bridge wore its sugar of rust and then shrugged it off when the van\u2019s brakes kissed the curb. Children collected at the edges of caution tape the way bees gather at citrus peel; they knew something sweet was being articulated, even if they could not yet name it. Jana hopped down not like a prisoner and not like a hero, but with the vague disrespect of a person who has always expected stairs to be honest about their angles. She felt the air cool under the bridge the way breath cools on teeth and liked that too. Some days the city touched the parts of her that had been turned iron-hot by bad jobs and told them to sit down on the tile and drink water.\n\nHer knot under the third was where she\u2019d left it, which is not a sentence you can often say in a place where drunk men correct graffiti with philosophy and bored girls untie ribbons because they can. She took it in her hand and felt in her palm the history of three clean shaves gone precise as arithmetic. She had tied those hairs tighter than hunger because she respected anything that might be asked to hold. The knot hummed like a throat with a cough that had decided to be a hymn instead. She glanced to see if Twyning had heard it. Of course she had. The sergeant\u2019s hearing was not ears so much as a map of old wounds that told her how the weather would travel through them.\n\n\u201cShow me,\u201d said Twyning, and that was the whole trick of her. She didn\u2019t say teach me so she could repeat it later with more authority. She said show me because she liked being the second pair of hands on a job.\n\nJana crouched and licked salt from her wrist where the city had left it like a kiss. She drew with a stub of chalk on the wet brick, not circles because circles are doors for stories to wander in, but figure-eights that crossed at the place every grandmother keeps her spare key. She tied a new scumble with two fresh hairs she had pulled that morning and one from the sergeant\u2019s coat where it had caught and made plans. She tucked the knot where water whispered old tax law and she spoke a sentence that had no poetry in it whatsoever and therefore worked. The sentence did what sentences once did in kitchens when a mother told a child to sit with their feet flat on the floor and a glass of milk ready to be drunk. It was not magic. It was manners tied to memory. The current softened one half-note and somebody above them laughed and then stopped because suddenly you could hear yourself breathing and it seemed rude.\n\nChildren stared like she had taken something out of a hat and it had learned their names. Jana did not look at them because looking at children makes them put on a show, and shows are a terrible diet for small souls. She looked at Twyning instead and saw the recognition pass across the woman\u2019s face like a weather front, gentle and thorough. \u201cNow,\u201d said Jana under her breath, placing the knot as if it were a plate at a thrift-store wedding. \u201cNow go home,\u201d said Twyning, not as instruction to people, but to water that had forgotten where it slept.\n\nThey worked the underside of three bridges in an hour because haste knew when to make itself useful. At each, the chalk made the figure-eights and the knot was speaking with hair instead of plastic, and the sentence\u2014the right kind\u2014pressed its small authoritative palm to the pipe\u2019s forehead and checked for fever. Mavery\u2019s dirty magic made cameras pick up only the sound of their own fans, and a man with a drone discovered that his drone had suddenly remembered that it was a toy, not a god. Jallo stood by the tape and told parents that standing at a railing and watching old women talk to mortar builds better bone than a year of supplements, and a mother believed him enough to put her cigarettes in her pocket and stop narrating disaster in a voice that taught her children to sing it later.\n\nBy the time they turned their attention to the docks, the light had fallen into that hour that makes even a bad man want to build a small clean thing with his hands. The boardwalk complained under their steps like an old aunt who expected people to respect her linoleum. Tar and brine and a sweetness like a factory had married and had offspring that clung to the sinuses with stubborn delight. Mavery met them out of a crooked office that sold permits to tie hopes to pilings. She had purple on her fingers and grin creases that made a better shirt than most shirts.\n\n\u201cThree counterfeit scumbles in a line and one up a ladder where only a fool or a saint would bother,\u201d she said, tucking herself between Jana and Twyning as if triangulation were her birthright. \u201cThe hum is wrong. It\u2019s dirty-sweet, like fruit that has been told a joke and won\u2019t stop laughing at itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow us,\u201d said Twyning. She had taken her hands out of her pockets and was letting the attention flow across her like a cloak. She knew better than to take off her authority in public, but she knew how to fold it thin. Mavery led them to a stanchion where an old metal ring still believed it would be useful to a rope, and there in the grime was a knot that had stolen hair off a brush and tied it into a loop that did not understand why it was a loop at all. Zip ties held it in a faithless hug. Jana felt a temper in her blood that had always pretended to be a different thing rise up and look for a hammer.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to own what they did not pay for,\u201d she said, not to the women but to the waterfaced thing that waits for human voices under planks. \u201cThey are trying to make the river say their names back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to sell a password,\u201d Mavery said, popping her gum like a charm. \u201cAnd you cannot sell one that keeps a door shut. You can only sell one that opens it.\u201d\n\nTwyning took the counterfeit scumble up with gloved fingers as if lifting a half-dead bird off a schoolyard. She put it on her palm and looked at Jana because asking is a habit that keeps people alive. Jana shook salt into the knot from a paper twist Mavery had conjured, and then she said the sentence again, the one with the now and the home, and when she reached the middle, Twyning folded her note into it, lower and capable of turning a crowd away from a burning building without making them feel they had lost. The zip ties shuddered. One snapped like a gamine\u2019s cheap bracelet. The water under the boards stopped trying to brag.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll tie more,\u201d Jana said, but her shoulders came down because we are built to appreciate even unknowable victories. \u201cThey\u2019ll tie them where we cannot smell them for a day or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we set bait,\u201d said Mavery. She did not mean to be cruel; she was merely ambitious about making the world choose her stalls instead of anyone else\u2019s. \u201cWe let one sit somewhere a camera wants to go and then we watch for who comes to preen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou enjoy working for both sides until you can fold them into one,\u201d said Twyning, and it would have sounded like condemnation if there had not been admiration in it. \u201cBe careful. Some men build only to pull things apart with their hands later when someone else is watching.\u201d\n\nMavery\u2019s mouth made a shape like sewing. \u201cThe men you worry about spelled their names on the underside of a bridge last night so the city would have to say them when it coughs. I am going to unteach the pipes their names. Go find me a villain I can invoice.\u201d\n\nJallo made a noise at their backs that meant Command had learned to type the word \u201cnarrative\u201d into a memo and believed technology had saved them from needing to know how stories function. He waved a hand like a drowned man signaling to a boat and then pretended he had only been stretching. \u201cThey are getting a sponsor for their press conference about decency,\u201d he said, and his face said he was embarrassed to belong to the species. \u201cThey want Jana to stand behind them with her eyebrows meaningful. They want Sergeant to say the word partnership.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them to print those words on paper and attach them to kites,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cThere is wind enough for everyone today.\u201d She looked out at the water and the water looked back with a face that refused to be photogenic. \u201cWe have work that cannot be panel-discussed.\u201d\n\nThey heard the voice before they saw the man, which is how it goes with certain kinds of danger. He came out of a warehouse door that had been painted an emphatic blue and had then learned humility under rain and porters\u2019 hands. He wore a jacket that made the word tactical into a catalogue, and his beard had been arranged an hour ago into an argument about masculinity. He smiled with his mouth and did numbers with his eyes. He had that look of a person who stands three feet from a mirror every morning and negotiates, successfully, with his reflection. Two boys behind him carried a bag that whispered the sound plastic makes when it believes it contains consent.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the artisan,\u201d he said to Jana, and managed to make artisan sound like something you wipe off a shoe. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who understood virality as if it were a river. We could have made a lot together if you had answered my message instead of acting like a fable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t answer men who ask me to monetise my grandmother,\u201d Jana said, and her voice located the place in the boards where they would break if everyone ran at once. \u201cYou tied a knot with stolen hair and told a pipe that it was a celebrity. The pipe laughed until it broke a boy.\u201d\n\nHe winced and then made it look like a smile because he had not been taught how to deal with a verb like broke when it applied to someone not him. \u201cCollateral tragedies are the tax that the new city pays to get old city out of its way,\u201d he said, and it was almost clever enough to live. \u201cI am not your enemy. I am brand safety with knees. I am the person who can make your tolls turn into dividends for you and a public-health initiative for the municipality. I know men in rooms. They are almost as tired as you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you hear yourself,\u201d Mavery asked, delighted and almost ashamed of her delight. \u201cYou talk like a man trying to sell aspirin to a river.\u201d\n\nTwyning stepped forward in such a manner that men in rooms would have gotten out of the way without later recognizing that they had been moved. \u201cSee,\u201d she said, softly enough that he had to step closer to be insulted. \u201cYou have inverted the grammar. You think first-person is a tide, and that you are its moon. You are, in fact, a barge with a loudhailer. Take your boys and their bag and go back to the place where men explain things to other men. We are removing your knots with the correct salt. We are teaching the river its house number.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have that authority,\u201d he said, and felt foolish while he said it because some authority advertisements you recognize too late. \u201cYou\u2019re a civil servant. You own a whistle, not a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cI own a sandwich and the memory of drowning and a city that answers when I call it by its birth name,\u201d said Twyning, and the boys behind him set the bag down like obedience had been a marble someone tossed to them and it had rolled into their palms. \u201cWhich is more authority than you will ever buy.\u201d\n\nHe tried to pivot because pivoting had saved him in rooms and alleys and marriages. He turned toward Jana and made an offer with his mouth that was probably a list of numbers leaned against a single word: freedom. She lifted the splurge and pointed it at his voice and smiled until he could not tell whether it was a kindness or her teeth. \u201cYou are the new kind of toll,\u201d she said, without moving the barrel enough to make anyone flinch. \u201cThe one greed invented when bridges started crying. The kind that thinks everything can be wrapped in language and therefore owned. You smell like sugar and metal and a mother who told you you\u2019d be a king if you smiled while you were cruel. Leave the docks. Leave the drains. Tie your knots in your own hair if you must tie something.\u201d\n\nThe boys behind him did the arithmetic that boys do when the ground refuses to be impressed by the pressure of their shoes. One put his hand in the bag and pulled out a splurge that had been manufactured like a rumor, and he held it like a toy he\u2019d been told was a god. Twyning didn\u2019t move faster than them. She did not need to. She said the sentence to the wooden ribs beneath them and the dock remembered that it knows how to creak at exactly the right time. The boy stumbled and the gun he was trying to make into a man fell against Jana\u2019s foot with all the resistance of a dog that has learned it will be fed even if it stops growling. Jana stepped on it lightly, not to break it but to remind it of its ancestry. Mavery had a hand at the boy\u2019s elbow and the kind of smile that made men tell the truth to save time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put you on a scooter and make you take your breakfast to your mother,\u201d Mavery said to him, calm as a judge with a cup of tea. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a mother, borrow one from a neighbor and bring the cup back. Don\u2019t buy grapes on the way.\u201d\n\nThe man with the beard had gone pale in points, like someone had erased him with a kneaded eraser. He looked at his boys and saw that they were already leaking their future back into the cracks of the dock. He made a noise like a plan and substituted it with a shrug like a curse. \u201cThis city will eat you,\u201d he said to Jana because prophecy is what men say when they want to sound like gravity. \u201cIt eats girls who think they own its stories.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a girl,\u201d she said, pleasantly. \u201cI am a troll. The city knows what to do with me. It is confused about you.\u201d\n\nHe left by a door that had always been there in buildings where men need exits to the street and to their cars and to their excuses. Twyning watched him go, not because she liked to watch enemies\u2019 backs but because she had a list of where to write to make sure he did not get to talk about narrative hygiene in any room where chairs had wheels. Jallo made notes like little oars. The water underfoot made a contented shape with its mouth.\n\nBy the time they had untied six counterfeit scumbles in a line that made too much sense and therefore had never been a river plan, Command had discovered a way to use the phrase \u201ccommunity partnership\u201d in a sentence without choking on the community or the partnership. They wanted to hold a demonstration of safety under Angel\u2019s Crossback at full noon and make people stand in squares and say the sentence into the air. They wanted a blessed angle and a sponsor that sold razors to men who feared age like a dog fears thunder. Mavery snorted until her gum surrendered its last grace. \u201cWe will do our demonstration now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will do it in a way that the algorithm cannot sell. We will do it with soup.\u201d\n\nThey did it with soup because soup is the content that refuses to be content. Twyning called three caretakers whose faces had learned to be multitudes and told them to bring vats. Mavery told a woman who made candles that smelled like safety to bring wicks that wouldn\u2019t burn in wind, which is to say she told her to bring nothing but a smile, and the woman came because women who make candles know that sometimes the wax is invisible. Jana stood under the third bridge and shaved a length of rope instead of a man, and the hair of the rope fell in curls that looked like laughter and children picked them up and made moustaches and no one died of ambition. Twyning said the sentence, once, twice, three times, and the third time the water made a sound like a person who has turned a pillow to the cool side and returned to a dream they can manage. Mothers dipped bread. Boys put down their phones long enough to burn their mouths. The grape smell lost a fight with onion and pepper and a bone that had given everything it owned without an invoice.\n\nIt didn\u2019t trend. It couldn\u2019t. It tasted good and it made an argument for bedtimes. The algorithm licked it once and put it away because it was like a grandmother, not a dance. Jana watched that failure with a happiness that embarrassed her a little because she had come to rely on that other species of success, the one that makes men in buttoned shirts say her name as if they had invented it. Twyning watched it with the calm of someone who has seen a crowd saved by boredom and knows what a miracle that is. Jallo ate two bowls and told the truth to his supervisor and did not get fired because a child on the rail had posted a clip of him wiping soup off his tie in a way that made the comments kinder for a full fifteen minutes.\n\nAfter soup, the grief that had been sitting on the curb like a dog with ribs came and sat under the rail, because grief knows where the food is. The mother from the stairwell came with a picture, and the picture had the kind of edges that small prints from old kiosks used to have, and she could not speak the word justice without making it sound like a street name. Jana did not know how to talk to mothers. She knew how to take men\u2019s money. She knew how to shave a soft jaw until it was eager to listen. She knew how to sleep under a pool that had been emptied of water and not dream of drowning. She stood a step away and let Twyning be the one who held the mother\u2019s elbow and took her coin because paying the toll is what keeps bridges from collapsing. They did not fix anything. They moved the next minute away from the drop.\n\nThey went back under to look for the other impossible knot\u2014the one that had done its work by the dock and claimed a name\u2014and found only the mark of it, a little burn in the brick like someone had held a lit cigarette to the city and asked it to admit to being alive. Jana ran her finger over it and felt the past sit up and cough. \u201cContractors,\u201d she said, almost surprised to hear the word and then not at all because she had been smelling their solvent in alleyways for a year. \u201cThe ones who wash old stories off new buildings. The ones who work for the ones who hate rust and love steel. This is their brand of wrong. They want gentlemen to feel safe in trousers that cost more than ducks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think they are tying circles to make a new sidewalk religion,\u201d Mavery said, and she loved the idea like a jeweler loves a flaw that gives a stone character and tells a story at a party. \u201cYou think they want to manage fear the way you manage breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they want to own the price of crossing,\u201d Jana said, and she spat into the drain because some gestures still count as punctuation when the city reads them. \u201cThey saw me making a living and they drew a business plan. They put hair on an invoice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always do,\u201d said Twyning. She was tired in that way that means the job is exactly where it ought to be. \u201cThey will put a charm on a crane and call it heritage. They will call me to cut a ribbon while they lay more cement where the river needs a mouth. We will find their yard. We will find their man with the beard and we will find his boss who knows how to sit very still when his name is said.\u201d\n\nJallo had already found the yard because he was an uncomplicated miracle when asked to follow trucks that pretended to be anonymous. He had a map traced in his notebook in a hand so neat a nun would have kissed it, and he pointed with his pencil because pointing with a finger causes temper. \u201cOut by the salt stacks,\u201d he said. \u201cBehind the place that used to sell pigeons, which now sells storage for people who will never be at home long enough to unpack. They have a security guard who reads novels and a camera that thinks fog is a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Twyning. She tucked the knot she had taken earlier back into the pocket where the little prayer lived, and the two things quarrelled pleasantly against her hip. \u201cWe will go in as caretakers bringing a complaint about drains because men in suits cannot resist telling caretakers about drainage. We will carry clipboards and our finest bored faces. Jana, you will be invisible because you do not own a clipboard and because men cannot see women they have not paid to insult them. Mavery, you will be in the ceiling, as usual. Jallo, you will make friends with the man who reads novels and find out whether he likes soup.\u201d\n\nThey went not like a raid, which would have made everyone on site gather their words into weapons, but like women going to correct a bill. The storage yard had the posture of a place that knows it is temporarily important and permanently vulnerable. The salt stacks made white hills like snow had been convinced to hold still for a portrait. A crane made its slow wet cross in the distance and the sky leaned close to hear if it would sing. The guard at the gate had a book whose cover had been loved to transparency. He saw the clipboards and his shoulders went down because clipboards are the form of weather that tells you your roof is not about to blow away.\n\n\u201cAfternoon,\u201d said Twyning, and her smile made him younger because grown women condescend less than radios. \u201cWe came about the drains at Angel\u2019s Crossback and signage about industrial water. I can give you only one of those today; the other is a meal we will cook together when you can explain to me who on your team likes to make friends with pipes using hair and lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this a survey,\u201d he asked, because sometimes men need a category before they can let their mouths be useful.\n\n\u201cIt is a conversation that ends better if you help it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name so I don\u2019t have to call you \u2018officer\u2019 and make you feel like you\u2019re captured.\u201d\n\n\u201cLen,\u201d he said, honest by accident. \u201cI don\u2019t like pickles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are solving a citywide pickle,\u201d said Jana, and she didn\u2019t mean to speak but the sentence borrowed her as a ventriloquist does a wooden friend. \u201cWe have soup. Somebody used your yard as a loading dock for counterfeit stories. They tied bad knots under our bridges and made the pipes sing the wrong tune. We came to ask whom you rent your reasons from.\u201d\n\nLen looked at Jana and, for a second, saw her because she had said his preference aloud without knowing it, and a heart that has been met on its own trivial hill cannot deny that a meeting has occurred. He scratched his eyebrow as if he\u2019d like to have someone shave it off so he could start over. \u201cYou talk like my aunt,\u201d he said to Twyning, and it was not an accusation. \u201cThe manager is in the hangar with the skylights that leak. He doesn\u2019t like weather unless it is in a forecast on a big screen. You can talk at him until he lets you sit down.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cWe are weather. Lead us to his leak.\u201d\n\nThey crossed a yard where pallets made rectangles like Lego cities built by a child who had absorbed the logic of urban planning by smelling it. Mavery\u2019s shadow slid over them once, twice, a gull behaving more intelligently than gulls ought, and then it was gone because she\u2019d found the break in the fence that let a woman become a rumor. Inside the hangar, the air tasted of solvents and ambition. Men in shirts that wanted to be made of money moved rolled-up blueprints back and forth like they were setting a table for a ghost banquet. The manager had a tie that pretended to be a harness. He smiled when he saw Twyning the way a man smiles when he has decided a woman is going to explain to him how he can have what he wants without paying.\n\n\u201cWe are in compliance,\u201d he said, before she had identified herself in any manner. \u201cIf you are here about runoff, we have forms. If you are here about hair, you will need to be more explicit, because my team does not run a salon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour team runs stories through drains,\u201d said Twyning, and once you had heard her say that you would have forgiven any sin to get her to teach you how to do it. \u201cUnder Angel\u2019s Crossback, a knot with stolen hair was tied with zip ties that your supplier buys in lots of five thousand and signs for with the name of a man who pretends not to read novels. Under the docks, a knot hummed in a key that is not the river\u2019s. In the Lower Blocks, a child fell because a boy who watched your video thought he could become a bridge by bullying his friend. I want the name of the department in your company that handles superstition. We will be shutting it down by tea.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because sometimes men laugh when the part of their body that believes in sovereign immunity realizes there is a court that does not recognize its flag. \u201cThere\u2019s no such department,\u201d he said, and then added, with the tiny cunning that has gotten him a window, \u201cbut if there were, we would be shuttering it ourselves in the name of brand stewardship.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour brand is a kind of mildew,\u201d Mavery said from somewhere that made three men look up and see only glass. \u201cIt comes in after the flood and leaves its ghost on curtains forever.\u201d\n\nJana drifted around the edges of the hangar like an old song people think they have forgotten, and looked for knots tied where men never glance. She found the altar in the corner, which was a joke for men and a thing for the city: three zip ties, a coil of cheap chain, a nail bent into a hook, and a printed flier for an event that promised to explain the undercity to investors in two hours with cocktails. The hair twisted into a loop had been cut, not shed, and that mattered in a way that made her teeth press themselves together to keep in a prayer. She scooped the mess into a plastic bin marked FLOOR MATS and carried it to Twyning, who lifted a brow like a weapons test.\n\nThe manager looked at the bin and performed innocence. He had done it in rooms where the carpet was thick as the promises, and it had made his salary clap its hands. Here on concrete, it made no sound at all. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d he said, and he did not make his mouth smaller before he lied, which is how you can tell which men have been allowed to practice their lies too long without kindly correction. \u201cThat could be from any one of a dozen subcontractors who consider tradition part of their going-to-market strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cTradition is something you are allowed to speak about when your shoes have learned to read the names on stairs,\u201d said Twyning. She did not lift her voice. It lifted itself. \u201cYou will give me the names of twelve, and I will make soup for the ones who tell me the truth first. The others can eat grape.\u201d\n\nA forklift beeped in a corner like a child with a new recorder. Men shuffled paper until it made them feel serious. Jallo handed the manager a pen that he had washed in a sink so often it had become gentle. The pen made neat black marks that said, in different spellings and with varying degrees of reluctance, a set of names that behaved like a family. Jana recognized two from contracts that had glanced the yards where she bought cartridges and carefully forgot her face. She put a finger on one, the one that pretended to be a charity at weekends, and she looked at Twyning and nodded because sometimes women perform telepathy at a professional level.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Twyning, and if he had been a better man he would have heard the absolution in the sound. \u201cWe will go now and teach a few men not to speak to pipes without permission. If you tie one more thing under my bridges, I will put you on a poster with hearts around your face. They\u2019ll call you the Pretty of Angel\u2019s Crossback and your mother will deny you three times before dinner.\u201d\n\nWhen they stepped back into the yard, the light had gone into that uncompromising clarity that cities sometimes give as a treat to people who have not lied to themselves for a few hours. The salt stacks shone like people who can afford to forgive. Len held out a thermos as if he were daring them to refuse gratitude. \u201cIt\u2019s soup,\u201d he said, unnecessarily. \u201cIt\u2019s not as good as the soup you make, but it\u2019s the kind my aunt taught me when I thought I could drink sugar for dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will drink it and tell her you are famous in the Lower Blocks for reading novels,\u201d said Twyning. Jana took a swallow and let the hot fat coat her throat as if it were a small, edible armor. She remembered being small on a floor counting coins with edges that would bite if you didn\u2019t respect them. She remembered not liking pickles and not being brave enough to say it aloud.\n\nThey were almost to the van when the air went wrong. You learn it if you live where weather and men compete for the right to make days sudden. The crowd noise under Angel\u2019s Crossback folded onto itself like a paper boat when a child pokes the bottom. Someone ran in a direction you do not run unless you are moving away from a thing with teeth. Mavery was gone by the time Jana turned to look because she was a professional, and professionals do not say, \u201coh,\u201d when the work appears; they vanish into it.\n\nIt was a knot in the wrong place that did it, tied clever where a camera had just enough angle and a child had just enough curiosity. It had made the pipe sing in the thin register that turns laughter into screaming, and a boy\u2019s hand had gone to his throat because human hands are eager to learn that gesture now. Jana ran. Twyning ran different, conserving strength because experience has shown her how long a sprint will be when the city decides to set an exam. They reached the mouth of the drain to find the scuffle that is not violence yet but wants very much to be promoted. A man with a phone had his arms out as if he could hold back consequence with two forearms and some moral fiber he\u2019d found in a TED talk. A girl had climbed onto a rail and was shouting the sentence wrong because she had only heard it secondhand, and the pipe did not recognize a badly hummed lullaby.\n\nJana did the thing with the breath. She put her mouth over her own panic and held it like an egg, then cracked it into the room and let the smell of onions and salt and steel and soap and old bread that lives in cupboards live there instead. She stepped into the center, which is not a place you ought to stand unless you are clear about who you are. She cupped the counterfeit scumble with both hands because sometimes puppets only stop performing when someone bigger picks them up. She said the sentence the right way, with the now in her left palm and the home in her right, and she did not say it to people. She said it to a pipe that had been made to feel like it was trending. Beside her, not touching but close enough to lend gravity, Twyning said the second note, the one only women who have packed sandbags in dresses and boots know how to hit. The hum dropped. The crowd\u2019s shoulders dropped. The girl came down off the rail like a bird who has remembered that flying isn\u2019t an argument, it\u2019s a private art.\n\nSomeone cried because the body needs a signal to say, \u201cwe will not die this minute.\u201d Someone else clapped because relief is an actor that does old bits in the wrong places. The knot in Jana\u2019s hands went slack and then crumbled because Mavery had found, days ago, a powder in a drawer that makes plastic forget it once thought it could be permanent. The camera caught nothing useful and then a great deal of soup, which the algorithm pushed dutifully at noon tomorrow under the tag COMFORT, and men turned the volume down and watched it without telling anyone that their throats had tightened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a child\u2019s hour now,\u201d said Twyning, when the immediate need had been taught to sit. \u201cChildren should be put to bed in rooms where something smells like a pot that remembers being warm. Let\u2019s go steal a flier and nail it to the door of the charity that launders fear. Mavery, throw dirt. Jallo, sharpen your pen. Jana, tie me three knots that say not here with a tooth in each.\u201d\n\nThey did not get to sleep. They rode the city like the horses that know which way the soldiers are going before the captain has made the map. They tied scumbles and untied lies. They turned gates precisely and they opened them wide when a woman with pink slippers needed to hear a river speak softly under her window because her house had been quiet too long. At dawn, a gull lit on the rail at Angel\u2019s Crossback and preened as if it had invented the word ritual. At dawn, a minister went on television and got one sentence almost right and another entirely wrong, and the wrong one got quoted because it had a joke in it about trolls that made a man in a studio laugh in a way that made children say he looked like their father.\n\nAt dawn, in the locker-room pool, the battery heater failed and Jana\u2019s hands went cold in the way that tells you what kind of person you are before breakfast. She pulled a blanket around herself that had once been a field flag at a parade and thought about the price of bridges and of shaving a man who had a dog on his shoulder and thought that perhaps she had taken on an unpaid internship as an older technology than she had intended. The razor lay beside her like a friend too well-behaved to wake her for gossip, and she let her eyes close because even trolls have to sleep if they intend to tie a city together tight enough that boys with sugar-water guns cannot loosen it by pointing them badly at throats.\n\nShe dreamed of a single hair bent into an impossible knot that someone kept tugging with greedy fingers until it screamed. She dreamed of a sentence that started with now and ended with home and the word in the middle changed each time, sometimes war and sometimes bread and sometimes children and sometimes tax. She dreamed of Twyning\u2019s voice saying it in a church with no walls and a ceiling made of river, and of Mavery selling admission at the door for the price of admitting you had once been frightened. She dreamed of a boy with a bricked phone putting it down and picking up a piece of chalk and drawing a figure-eight on his step so his sister would not fall.\n\nWhen she woke her hand was already reaching for the cartridges she had promised herself she would change. Mavery had been right. The grape had become a joke boys were dying for. She took the vials with their ridiculous cheerfulness and tipped them into a jar with salt and dish soap and hot water and watched the color sink like a show-off swallowing his tongue. She wrote a note and taped it to the wall with surgical tape that had once held a wound closed. The note said: Purple is retired. Bring me a shade that makes boys admit to crying and keeps them home long enough to stop laughing. Mavery would understand. Mavery understood more than was good for anyone in this city who planned to be alive two years from Tuesday.\n\nBy midmorning, the charity had been named aloud by a woman with a spoon, and the manager with the tie that thought it was a harness had given a quote about partnerships that the news cut just before he said the word stewardship. Twyning had a meeting on a bench with a grandmother who wore a coat like a ship and told her that it would be all right to put a chalk line on the stoop and ask men to pay by putting their phones in their pockets. Jallo took a call from a boy who wanted to confess to not being brave on a stairwell and told him he would be given the job of not being brave again tomorrow and the next day and the rest of the year until the habit took. The river tasted like metal and soup and coins and a sweetness that might once have been grapes and was now turning into something else, something like patience.\n\nNear noon, a message slid under the door of the caretaker\u2019s room with the precision of a cat\u2019s paw. It was a single hair, blade-steel, tied in a knot that neither belonged to Jana nor had been tied by a fool. It sat on an envelope with no return address. Inside, there was a sentence written in ink the color of sidewalks after rain. The sentence did not threaten and it did not brag. It said: Now we will see if your home is bigger than mine. It said it without capital letters, as if it had decided religion could be discussed only in lowercase.\n\nTwyning read it first and folded it back into the envelope and put the envelope in her pocket next to the little prayer and the scumble that had not yet decided who it belonged to. She looked at Jana and did not smile because smiles weigh a lot when you make them do so much. \u201cWe have our thief of circles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have our next bridge. Eat your soup. Bring your razor. Wear your tired like a ribbon. We are going to ask the city to love us enough to be inconvenient in all the right places.\u201d\n\nJana finished the last of the soup because you cannot bargain with hunger and win unless you sit at the same table. She put her hand on the van as it coughed into willingness and felt, through its metal, the hum of the undercity listening, curious and bored and mean and kind the way children are. She set her splurge down beside her. She set her razor against her wrist. She thought about tolls, and taxes, and the way a good story steals the shame out of your mouth and replaces it with a sentence that fits a bridge as perfectly as hair fits a scumble. Then they went, not because a minister had made a speech, but because the river had asked in its old quiet voice and neither of them knew how to say anything but yes to it when it remembered their names.They took the van along streets that had learned the grammar of sirens and sleeping dogs, the envelope with its lowercase dare folded beside Twyning\u2019s prayer as if paper could argue with paper and come to a truce. Jana read the sentence again because repetition is a kind of scent you lay down in front of yourself so you can find your way back if the city forgets you, and she said, without meaning to give the thought air, that the person who had written it understood the difference between address and threat. Twyning agreed without opening her mouth, which was something Jana had started to notice and not fear; it felt like standing in a kitchen where somebody who had worked out a recipe with stubborn patience watched you try your hand at it and did not correct you until you reached for the salt with the wrong fingers. Jallo drove as if he were ferrying a sleeping child and a fuse in the same blanket, and he made notes out loud to keep himself honest; he listed the bridges that were awake, the drains that were dreaming badly, the names they had collected on their clipboard like birds that might come when called to soup.\n\nMavery met them two turns shy of the river\u2019s oldest brick with a bag she had stitched from billboard vinyl that had once pretended to sell clean skies. She brought cartridges the color of smoked glass and said, with relish held in a little bowl of restraint, that she had bottled the scent of rain after a first lightning and taught it to live politely inside a bullet. Jana held one up to the light and saw the amber not as a trinket but as a recipe written in solvent and luck, and her shoulders loosened because this was not an invitation to a joke; it was a request that boys who wanted to be brave in kitchens would have to think before they imitated it. Twyning took two and put them in her coat like a woman sliding notes from a choir director into the lining for later use, and she told Mavery she had been generous in a way that would cost her customers, which is another way of saying brave when you don\u2019t want to flatter a friend so hard she falls over.\n\nThe knot on the envelope had not been Jana\u2019s and not the amateur\u2019s, and the more she rolled it in her hand the more she felt the grammar of someone who had been taught rituals from a different anthology than hers. It had been tied with patience and the small malice of neatness, the way a person stacks coins to make sound go quiet, and she did not know yet whether the hair it held would sing when you called it by its river name. Twyning said the word museum in the middle of a sentence about drains and made the van believe that their next stop would not be a bridge, and Jana smiled because she understood; you go to where people keep their versions of home catalogued and under lights when you want to find the man who thinks his home is larger than everyone else\u2019s because he has insured it. The museum in the Iron Ward had been a train shed and then a warehouse and then an empty rumor and now it held models of the city carved from wood and poured in resin and printed from plans until the entire undercity had been turned into a toy that boys in suits could move with one finger and feel godlike about without getting their hands river-wet.\n\nThey walked in with clipboards and exhaustion that read as authority, and the guard at the door took one look at Twyning and decided to trust his morning instead of his training. The model of Angel\u2019s Crossback was larger than a table and smaller than a pride, its rivets picked out in solder, its drains represented by polished tubes you could see through if your eyes knew how to look at glass and not see yourself first. A man stood with a pointer and a certainty and told three people who wanted to be ready for the floodgates how safety could be a brand if you made it less boring, and Jana thought he spoke like the letter that had slipped under their door: lowercase and clean and designed to be repeated until it sounded like prayer. He did not have the tactical beard; he had the jaw of a boy the city had forgiven for too much too early, and his hands were the good kind of soft, the sort that have known paper and chalk and the weight of a name in a ledger.\n\nTwyning joined the group as if she had been there all along and asked a question about the pitch of a pipe in a tone that made the pointer slow down and check whether he had mispronounced volume. He smiled with relief because he had been waiting for an adult to arrive and make the room behave, and he told her that the plan for managing folklore had been assigned to his team because you cannot leave myth to police or to profit alone, and the word assigned carried so much priest and so much accountant that Jana almost laughed before she remembered the stairwell and the boy with the wrong kind of blue on his fingers. The pointer called himself Curator of Underspeech and had a card printed on recycled something that would never rot, and he disapproved of the term troll because it distracted from outcomes, which were measurable and therefore useful. Jana did not give him her name because she had learned that there are people you shouldn\u2019t let pronounce you until they have earned the right not to grind you between their teeth in front of an audience.\n\nHe had tied knots, she could smell it even with the resin and the varnish pretending to be air, and he had meant them to be helpful, which made her heart and her mouth argue over who should be in charge of insults. He talked about community gateways and participatory tolling in a way that made the skin on the back of Twyning\u2019s hands get ready to go cold, and he said softly that the city needed something to stitch it in places where stitches had been forbidden by budgets, and that men like him could be the needle if only the thread would come without knots. Mavery made a sound in the back of her throat that meant she could sell him his own shoes and have him thank her for the way she tied the laces, and she drifted away up into the rafters to find the camera that was definitely watching this exhibition of reason.\n\nThey did not arrest him. They did not cut his card in half and press the pieces into his palm until the letters imprinted themselves onto his life line. They let him show them his plan, which was an imitation of a ritual drawn by someone who loved diagrams more than bridges, and they humored his pilfered sentence, which started with when instead of now and ended with harbor instead of home because he had never had to think about what it meant to live in a block that kept its doors open for air. Twyning told him, while looking at the model of a pipe, that if he tied one more community gateway without the permission of a woman who knew how to make soup and a man who could accept pickles being taken off his lunch, she would have to take it personally, and he blinked twice because he had just learned how large a person can be without making any noise.\n\nAfter that courtesy they went hunting, not for him but for the knot he had promised in lowercase, and the scent of it took them uphill, away from the river\u2019s brag, into the district where buildings remembered being mills and held the smell of flour in their wood the way hands remember smoke years after the fire has moved on. The sentence on the envelope had started a measure, and they followed it to a place called the Spindle, where threads used to be given to machines and turned into wages and then into funerals; now it was a mixed-use temple where yoga pretended to be forgiveness and forgiveness pretended to be a drink you could buy with oat milk. The knot had been tied inside the atrium, under a skylight that a contractor had convinced to stop leaking by promising it a plaque with his name on it, and it was hung from the ribs of the building like a charm meant to prevent lawsuits. It was beautiful because it had been made by a hand that instinctively turned function into show, and it was deadly because it had stolen hair from a hundred brushes and did not know what those heads had prayed for when they cut it.\n\nJana stood under it and felt every mistake she had ever made assemble itself for a roll call, and she resisted the urge to slice the thing free with one flick and call it over, because she had begun to understand that the city never lets you finish something satisfying when a crowd is nearby. Twyning took in the room as if she were a tailor measuring guilt for a suit, and she pointed at the corners where the voices would become ugly if someone said the wrong word. Mavery had already ghosted up the metalwork and tapped the knot with a fingernail, and the hum that came back was exquisite and stupid and full of self-regard. Jallo went and stood by the entrance and started talking about a maintenance issue because a maintenance issue is the spell that keeps people from coming into a room with their phones open when they should not come into a room at all.\n\nThere was no grape to cut through; the smell here was new, a varnished hope that men buy because it looks good on a mantlepiece, and Jana knew that the only way to unmake this one was to pay more dearly than she liked. She took a strand of her own hair, not the surface kind that falls when you pull a sweater over your head, but one rescued from the point above the ear where tenderness lives, and she laid it on the floor with the carefulness she brought to money that could not be got again. She took from inside her shirt the thread she had wound months ago from the eyebrow hairs of the first three men she had shaved until their faces thought they were statutes and their minds learned to be quiet for a hour; that thread had seen bridges and soup and the back of a van, and it had been her passport, and she tied it into the knot at the Spindle with her own, making a scumble inside the counterfeit that would not let the big neat loop do its showy harm. The hair sang when she touched it with warm fingers, and the sound went down the ribs of the building and into the bones of its oldest beams and made them remember the voices of women who had once worked here and made this place run and ran while men owned them on paper and in law and in beds that had been bought with their fingers.\n\nTwyning stood below and said the sentence like a woman saying grace over steam, and she let the middle word be bread because bread had been a god here, and the end be home because even mills need to go somewhere to sleep. The knot trembled like a rich person being told no and then sagged because Mavery, predictable as a sun in her mischief, had emptied a pouch of ground salt into the exact seam of the exact beam that would carry the weight where it would learn manners. The crowd in the lobby, arrested by the news of a maintenance issue, did that slow turn away you get when boredom wins its small victory over spectacle, and Jana felt the floor the way a woman feels a baby roll inside her and realized the city would tolerate their correction today if they stopped making it look like a performance.\n\nThey finished the untying with hands that had performed grief the hour before and would need to perform soup soon, and then the lesser sound began\u2014the squawk of drones that had been sent to film a different triumph and had decided to take a detour. Mavery swore with elegance and snapped a little chrysalis of wire and resin from her pocket that coughed radio boredom into the air, and the drones lost interest and went to stare at a puddle where a sunbeam was doing what sunbeams do best. Twyning nodded to Len\u2019s cousin, who had plainly taken a job at the Spindle because his aunt had told him grown men should have coats even in August, and the cousin nodded back because sometimes cities are nothing but families pretending to be bureaucracies to keep the furniture from turning into weapons.\n\nThey took their leave before gratitude made the building\u2019s manager come and give a speech, and on the way down the stairs Jana said, without pride and without apology, that she had tied her hair to a counterfeit because sometimes you have to invest yourself in an enemy to persuade it to stop howling. Twyning replied that she had eaten stranger sacrifices in other uniforms and found them good for the digestion if taken with bread and a little onion, and then she called Rell and asked if the north gate could be made to burp with theatricality at three in the afternoon, because she had decided to make a crowd move away from an amphitheatre with a river noise instead of a baton. Rell promised her a burp so dignified it would be quoted in alleys for a week, and Jana felt the peculiar happiness of a day in which women who have never met are pulling on the same rope and the rope has decided to be useful.\n\nBy mid-afternoon they had answered three messages written in chalk and one note carved into paint with a key, and the charity that had been laundering fear came to them with a clean statement and an empty ledger and the boss with the beard somewhere learning that you cannot invoice a river without first paying for your name. They were a block from Angel\u2019s Crossback again because all stories when they are honest end up under their first bridge, and there the child who had drawn a figure-eight on his step stood with a borrowed broom and a plan in his face; he explained that the older boys had tried to draw circles on the sidewalk at the place where the scooter delivery men like to ruin ankles, and he had corrected them by throwing water and telling them about the sentence, and he had said now and they had laughed at him, and then the gate had burped like a man who has had more soup than fits in his suit and the boys had decided to go shoplift snacks somewhere else. Twyning awarded him the authority of being right by asking him to show her his chalk and asking him if he would be offended if she stole a piece because grown women have to learn from children without taking their pockets along with the lesson.\n\nThe Curator of Underspeech sent them another envelope, lighter paper this time, and inside it a smaller knot tied with hair that glinted like something the river itself might have dropped when it thought no one was watching, and a sentence that said that he had found his home and would defend it with rituals approved by committees. Jana held the knot up and said, with honest respect edged with a need to win, that he had been clever to let his hair be what it was without pretending to be old, and Twyning said that she had known men who tied their family names to deeds and believed it was the same as children, and that this man would learn the difference when a drain refused his permission. They did not go to him. They made him come to a place that did not love him, which in this case was the undercarriage of the tram line between the hospital and the stadium, where the concrete had taken the weight of a thousand touchdowns and a million sodium-lit apologies and felt no obligation to pretend it was a cathedral.\n\nHe arrived in a coat that believed weather took orders and a face that had arranged itself to be disappointed, and he stood under the tram and tried to make a stage out of a place where rust actually grows from air and not just from water. Jana waited until he had placed his feet on the terrible green kiss of pigeon leavings, and then she told him the truth that men in coat rooms never hear spoken below carpets; she said that any ritual worth doing could be done in the dark with one hand because you have a baby on your hip with the other, and his knot had hands that had never picked up a child who had fallen asleep in a doorway while waiting for soup. He steadied himself by producing a certificate and a permit in a clear sleeve and announcing that he had been tasked with standardizing undercity engagement, and he spoke the sentence in an accent that had learned its vowels from countries that call rain an event.\n\nTwyning listened like a riverbed listens, which is to say she measured him against the way the water will behave and found him lighter than he had admitted to being, and then she spoke, not to the man but to the tram line, in the same voice she used when she asked Rell for gates and grandmothers for forgiveness; she said there would be noise now because a crowd needed to step back, and the tram complied by ignoring her because it was busy, but the people complied by finding themselves twelve inches further away from the undercarriage than they had been when the man\u2019s permit was new. Mavery stood directly above the Curator on the platform and tossed into the air a handful of dull glitter she had made from ground zip ties and lint, and when it came down in the light it looked like a bad idea deciding not to be born.\n\nThey argued, but they did it not as men and women do on television with words sharpened for brand, and not as mobs do when they smell blood and want theater, but as neighbors who have to share a hallway and an elevator and a garbage chute and therefore know the price of winning. The Curator said that if the city did not invent a taxonomy for its monsters, someone else would, and he preferred the monsters to have footnotes and grants; Jana replied that the monsters had already invented themselves when the roads had been ripped up and that no footnote has ever stopped a boy from wanting to put his hands on a friend\u2019s throat to see what science feels like. Twyning told him that his lowercase was a trick to make violence whisper, and that she had been trained by shouting and silence and neither had fooled her, and he blinked because she had moved his pointer to the other side of the room without touching it.\n\nWhen it was over\u2014because argument has end points like bridges do if you have the good sense to stop building somewhere\u2014the Curator gave up a list without admitting that it was a list; he named the two community partners who had provided him with hair and access to drains and he excused it by saying something about lived experience that would have read better in a brochure; he confessed the gate he\u2019d bribed to open not to water but to donors; he claimed that if they let him keep one bridge he could prove that community can be managed. Jana told him he could keep a model and speak into its plastic as long as he liked and she would cut his microphone when he tried to make his toy swallow a river, and Mavery offered to sell him a candle that smelled like humility for his office and then told him she was joking and watched the relief curdle into a promise of revenge he probably couldn\u2019t afford. Jallo took a photograph of the underside of the tram, not because it would look good in a report but because there is value in showing men who make maps that their city has angles they cannot print.\n\nNight requested permission to perform itself and was told to come in and make tea. The gates sounded like old friends unashamed of their coughs. Under Angel\u2019s Crossback, soup happened again, not as a demonstration but as something to do with hands that had been making fists all day and had run out of useful targets. Someone hung a string of lights from one rail to the other as if bridges were arms that wanted to wear jewelry when the work was not too heavy, and Jana got a glimpse of what the undercity could be if greed were persuaded to shave its eyebrows for a year and sit quietly and learn to slice onions without cutting its fingers. Twyning counted children by the sound of their shoes and adulthoods by the sound of their sighs and knew that tonight very few of them would be demanded by good television because the river had been fed sentences and broth and had chosen to stop escalating.\n\nAfter midnight, when the van had done its animal breaths and the city had become domestic in the way of beasts that have eaten well and are thinking about sleeping near the fire instead of hunting the dark for myth, they went to the pool. Jana\u2019s mattress was there because home is sometimes where the lifeguard chair has a shadow that knows your name, and the tiles had decided not to remember water for a few hours to spare her dreams. They did not talk about the next day because talking about the next day attracts gods who think you are daring them to ruin your plans, and they did not say the sentence because you only say it when you need to instruct a pipe or a crowd and the only thing that required instructing here was the desire to tell a story that made you sound braver than you had been. Twyning took out the knot from her pocket and untied it in her mind and retied it as an absence, which is how caretakers sleep when they can.\n\nIn the morning, which arrived like a bill\u2014expected, dull, and requiring money you had already spent\u2014they were summoned by a sound that was not gate, not police, not hospital. It was a whistle from the old factories, a child of steam that had learned to imitate a man shouting across water and refusing to be drowned, and it came from a quarter that had not yet had to admit that the river could be an employer. The message underneath was easy to read if you had spent long enough letting markets in dreamland alleys teach you their shorthand: the charity with the Friday-night face was emptying itself before dawn, and trucks were moving plastic crates that had never held food. Mavery rolled off a bench, braided her hair like a plan, and said she had a friend at the gate who preferred soup to paperwork, and Jana stretched and found that sleep had braided itself around her in a knot you could untie without cutting if you were gentle.\n\nThey reached the yard before the sun climbed into fussy clarity and found the men who had run the charity\u2019s laundering\u2014of fear, of ritual, of small, clean community work\u2014loading a pallet with the kind of caution that comes from carrying things that should have been declared significantly earlier in the week. Twyning showed them her clipboard first because there is a species of thief who respects the shape of an office more than they fear any weapon, and she asked whether their exit interview had gone well in a voice that made one man, the one with sleeves that ended in ink and regret, tell her which truck had the hair and which had the money. Jana saw the coil of zip ties that had been used to persuade a pipe to say the wrong names and she felt that thin clean anger that she knew to be a better tool than rage because it has handles and you can set it down without burning the room.\n\nThey did not do raids, which leave bruises that become a martyr\u2019s explanation for later crimes; they did inventory, which leaves audits and signed forms and the kind of boredom that makes bad men forget to run. Jallo took numbers like a harvester brings in wheat, precise and tired and briefly happy, and wrote receipts for things nobody should have owned and filed them in a folder that had quiet teeth. Mavery sipped from a cup that had never seen tea and leaned into a corner where a camera believed the night had not ended, and she said into the dark that she had candles that smelled like waiting and she would trade them for names; someone gave her a name spelled in two languages and a secret in one, and she put one in her pocket and gave the other to the floor where secrets get turned into chalk later.\n\nBy noon, Command had invented a patrol for the manipulation of ritual, which was almost funny, and the minister had broken a sentence in two and left the wrong half lying on the floor of a studio. The Curator of Underspeech sent a third envelope, this one with hair that had been washed in something expensive that claimed to be river-colored, and inside there was a chart with lines that wanted to prove that ritual could be measured and sold at wholesale if you put enough commas between the words. Jana tacked it to the wall of the pool and threw a paper airplane at it and Mavery clapped because failure is a kind of performance art you don\u2019t have to charge admission for if you are generous.\n\nIn the afternoon, a mother took a chalk and drew a figure-eight on the door of a school and told three girls that they could say now and home when they were frightened, and a boy took his grandmother\u2019s coin and rolled it until it sang like a small loud river and did not go into the stairwell with the printed splurge a boy offered him in exchange for content. In the late afternoon, the old soldier who had given his name to the Angel\u2019s Crossback in stories twice died in a way nobody can write because he had in fact moved two towns over and decided to grow beans, and the bridge continued to collect taxes in the language of footsteps and soup spills and brief apologies, and Twyning made a note to visit the beans when this lull finished. In the evening, a woman tied her own hair into a knot over her door and said out loud that if anybody came to sell her safety she would ask them whether they took pickles off sandwiches for their friends, and when the salesman frowned she knew to shut the door.\n\nThey wanted to sleep, but there was the envelope and the hair and the quiet promise that someone else had a map and was laying it over theirs, and so they went out into the dark city that knows merit and marks it in ways a minister cannot list. They went to the place where men plan floods and they scratched a figure-eight into a wall they would never admit to scratching and they left a bowl of soup where a rat who could have been a saint could eat it. They went to the place where a girl had tied a razor to a string and spun it until it sang and they told the balcony the sentence and the balcony let go of a habit it had been cultivating in secret and felt better. They went until the river looked up and said, in its not-voice, that it had been wavering and now it would settle, and for a few hours, enough to let people put their heads down without bargaining with air, it kept its promise.\n\nMorning was waiting behind curtains because cities hoard dawn for people who have earned it, and when the light came mending through the fissures of the pool\u2019s glass, Jana had a thought that belonged to old women and young liars: that staying would kill her faster than running and that leaving would solve nothing except the problem of her own breathing. Twyning woke with a list already unspooling behind her eyes and a craving for bread that had to be dipped, and she considered writing a letter to the caretaker who would take her chair when she was finally made to stop walking and say: the city is good when you ask it to be better, and sometimes that is the only technology that matters. Mavery blew smoke into a jar and sealed it and wrote on the lid the word luck and put it on a shelf because she was tired of pretending she did not believe in stupid, solid things.\n\nThey took the van to a place where cranes rested their necks and listened to women swear, and the river flat-out refused a sponsor that wanted to rename a pier after a detergent, and somewhere, holding a coffee that had taught itself how to be bitter without being deep, the Curator stared at his empty knot box and decided to come and see if the undercity\u2019s home was bigger than his because lowercase was not saving him from wanting capital. He came without a camera and without his coat, and he stood under Angel\u2019s Crossback at an hour when only people who have errands and losses are awake, and he said please in a way that made Twyning lend him a chair and a bowl because she believed in being paid with better enemies. He asked how to tie the knot that meant not here and how to untie the one that meant me first, and Jana showed him with her hands in the air so he would have to come to the drain if he wanted to repeat it, and when he did, later, with salt and with a hair that had not been stolen, the pipe did not mock him. He told them, while he was learning, that there was a last bridge where someone neither of them owned had tied something ancient and airtight, and that it had pulled at him the way a train pulls at a coin left on its rail, and that he could not do anything about it with lowercase or permits or men whose shoes did not squeak.\n\nThey went. Of course they went. They went because the sentence in the envelope had been a bell and because the city likes to see if the people who claim it are willing to count the steps to a place where even daylight crouches low. They went to a bridge that had no name because history had mislaid it and the current administration didn\u2019t want to encourage sentiment about things that could not be monetized. It wore vines like a widow and clung to a bank that had been promised a park if the funds came through by winter, and underneath, in the place where girls who need to scream go when they cannot alarm their mothers, a knot hung that did not incorporate hair at all. Jana felt its pull and knew that whoever had tied it belonged to neither soup nor permit; it had been made of twine and sins and one of the old languages that forgets vowels when it curses, and it did not hum, it listened. Twyning stood with her feet apart and her mouth shut and her bones ready to protest, and she felt in her hip the little prayer grow very still as if an older religious practice had entered the room and wanted to see its papers.\n\nThis one would not be cut by razors or softened by salt. This one had to be addressed and asked; it had to be treated like a grandmother with a knife\u2014respected, negotiated with, refused only if you had nothing else to lose. They stood together with the Curator a step back because he had been told to be humble and had decided to practice once in his life, and they let the city make a sound that was not whistle, not pipe, not drone, not applause. It was the sound a home makes when rent is due and payday is an hour too far and the bridge between what you have and what you need has to be made out of sentences you can afford. Jana spoke first because trolls have to, and she said now so it would hear her, and Twyning ended with home because she wanted it to know she was not advising, she was promising, and Mavery picked out of her pocket a coin that had been rolled smooth by four generations and put it in the knot as if giving a god a tip for being patient, and the knot did not change shape but the air did, and with that small breath, something in the city agreed to be slightly less cruel in the morning.Chapter Nine\n\nThe morning that had agreed to be slightly less cruel kept its promise until the hour when men in offices stand up and decide to move pieces they think are theirs. Twyning was summoned with a document that pretended to be a courtesy and a panel that called itself Public Assurance, and the Curator of Underspeech was already in a chair when she entered, lowercase tucked in his collar like a saint\u2019s relic. They had a screen with the city peeled like fruit on it and a bar at the bottom for sentiments. They had a plan to formalize rituals, to number tolls, to turn sentences into bullet points that could be financed. Twyning sat with a patience that made one junior official check his clock because he felt late for something, and when they asked her whether the Brethren would accept a pilot project to standardize community gateways, she smiled like a woman who is honest about her age and said she had seen men standardize grief and had watched women continue to invent funerals that worked. The Curator avoided her eyes until she mentioned soup, and then he looked up because he had not yet learned how to dislike being taught by a person with broth on her sleeve.\n\nJana had woken with the old knot sitting on her tongue like a word she wasn\u2019t allowed to say in a polite house. The thing under the nameless bridge pulled sideways on her breath all day, and every drain she passed hummed in a key shifted a fractional hair low, as if the city had been told a joke and was trying not to laugh because the telling had been bad. Children had begun to leave offerings that belonged to them in the way only children\u2019s offerings do: a marbled shooter with a crack and therefore more luck trapped inside it, a ribbon from a braid that had been cut because heat makes girls rash, a stone too thin to be useful and therefore valuable. Someone tucked between the bricks three bones from a soup that had lasted a week and tasted better each day, and Jana touched them with two fingers and recognized hunger turned into currency. The old knot was listening. It had a grandmother\u2019s ears and a blade warming on her apron. It would not be bought with sponsorships or shots where a drone tilted politely to turn suffering into weather.\n\nBy noon the pipes spoke in a new register that could not be captured by any microphone. Words failed on screens in little patches as if the algorithm had caught a skin complaint. Up on the rail a boy started to tell a story about the stairwell and found himself bereft of adjectives, and the silence that followed his mouth was more dangerous than a shout. The grandmother with the knife had reached a hand into the room and closed it around the trick we had all adopted, the one where we survive by ornamenting our regret until it sells. The price, when it came, was the only one worth paying. She wanted stories told true and heard, not performed, in exchange for a city that would continue to hum. Twyning understood the levy before anyone wrote it on a whiteboard. She sent children to carry cards to stoops and benches, and the cards said with pantry-plain words: bring your voice and your bread under a bridge tonight; sit down; be the audience someone else has never had; the toll is to listen.\n\nCommand tried to call it a program and to issue a hashtag, and the hashtag sputtered like a match in the wet. The river took the habit of evenings and made it liturgy. Under the third bridge, under the Angel\u2019s Crossback, under a broken arch in a back alley with a drain that had never seen daylight, people sat in an ellipse with bowls, and a man whose face had been shaved by Jana until it could pass for statuary told a story about the time his mother had refused a medal so she could keep the box and hide her rent in it. A girl with a knee scar the shape of a bread slice told about falling and the grandmother who salted each scrape as if healing were a stew that required seasoning to remember its work. They were not good at it at first. They narrated the way people do when they are still applying for a job that doesn\u2019t exist. Little by little the old knot\u2019s knife relaxed. Little by little the pipes began to lean their heads in as if courted by a song for once tailored to their age.\n\nThe new cartridges Mavery had brewed uncurled like weather, amber as a traffic light that knows when to let the children cross. Their smell was rain after the first lightning, a clean the city remembers in its joints the way a dancer remembers a step a decade after she quits. Boys who might have printed their courage in kitchens paused a minute longer when confronted with a shade that didn\u2019t promise marvelous, only consequence. One tried to copy and ended up with a brown sugar sludge that jammed first and then fell in love with the floor, and the laughter that followed that moment was the useful kind, the sort that leaves its thumbprint on shame and then shakes your hand.\n\nThe contractors did not stop because money does not know how to hear \u201cenough.\u201d They rolled out Public Safety Corridors in the Lower Blocks with an app that wanted you to register your fear for points you could redeem for a discount on a branded lantern. The guards they hired wore empathy on their uniforms like a patch you iron on because it costs less than learning the skill, and they called their batons \u201cbehavior correctors\u201d while insisting they had never in their lives struck anything without remorse. The Curator stood with a clipboard four feet from those men and hated that his name was now on their paperwork. He sent Jallo a copy of a contract in which the word ritual had been defined by a man who filed a patent on grief the year the water climbed the third step, and Jallo, who had never before performed espionage and prepared to repent for it, walked the pages down to Twyning with his collar warm and his face set in the shape he wore when he lied to a minister about resource allocation and said it later in the kind of confessional that still makes old women get up and make a sandwich.\n\nIt would have been easier if all wrongs stood in one line, if the bearded brand-safety man could be flattened by one sentence and a well-timed burp from the north gate. But the city is a dial, not a switch. It turns incremental, it ratchets, it needs wrenching and release in alternation until the thread catches. Mavery\u2019s supply lines were threatened by men with delicate shoes who sent her health code inspections as flirtations and warnings that her stall would be removed to make room for a vendor who sold candles that smelled like contracts. She strung the ceiling over her corner of the market with rain cartridges connected by a wire as thin as superstition and as strong, and when a man in shoes stepped through with a measuring tape and a smile learned in a mirror, she pulled a string and made the whole block smell like a storm. He turned his head the way a child does when thunder is new and left with his tape feeling smaller in his pocket and a plan to file paperwork that would die in a pile because the city had decided to prefer weather over men\u2019s increments for the afternoon.\n\nThe woman in pink slippers came to the van with her hair braided not as plea but as statement, and said in a voice scrubbed like a bowl after bread dough has been taken out of it that she had signed a paper that made her safe and that her man with the dog had been moved to a room where the windows didn\u2019t open and would stay as long as she needed him not to be walking around. She asked if there was a rule about shaving that applied to women who had been told that if they changed their hair they would change their luck, and Jana answered before Twyning because this piece belonged to her. She said she did not shave women to mark them, that razors turned away from the story written under the jawline and toward the story written on the scalp too easily, and that if the woman wanted a new face to greet herself with she could sit with Mavery for the price of a cartridge and a debt that didn\u2019t smell like grapes, and Mavery would tend the eyebrows back with patience instead of taking a tax with chrome. The woman nodded and left with a small bag that looked like a drug only to people who do not keep combs in their houses, and the pink slippers slapped the stairs with gladness in a rhythm that made three children think of drums, and the dog tattoo across the hall lifted two ears because there are signs even ink learns to respect.\n\nWhen the old knot tested them, it did it by removing a sound nobody knew they needed until it was absent. The undercity went quiet between two breaths. The pipes held their noise as a teacher holds a scolding to let it gather effect, and the crowd standing under Angel\u2019s Crossback felt the hair on their arms do that thing that makes the mouth assemble prayers it had deleted. It wasn\u2019t the emergency tone that tastes like copper, and it wasn\u2019t the building alarm that makes you remember whether you left the burner on. It was the loss of hum, of city\u2019s throat singing to itself, that big animal comfort. Jana placed the razor on the rail because superstition wanted its hands free, and she and Twyning did the sentence divide as if it had always been a duet; Jana took the now and let it ripen across her tongue until it was a verb big enough to shelter a dozen frightened knees, and Twyning hugged the home in from the edges with a gravity that made the bolts in the bridge turn their heads. Plastic cameras caught nothing but their own fans. The hum returned not like an apology but like a friend who has been asked to be quiet for a minute so someone else could say their piece and who returns, grudging and loyal.\n\nThey understood what the old thing wanted then. It wanted a tithe in attention. It wanted the city to learn to be an audience before it would agree to continue to be a stage. So they built nights around telling. They forbade clapping and encouraged breath. They outlawed commentary and permitted soup, which kept mouths busy. Grandmothers taught boys how to sit on their hands. A pair of teenage girls told the second half of a story they had never been allowed to begin, and the second half proved sufficient for a week. Len from the gate came one evening and spoke about his aunt in the old factory, about thread and how machines learn your hands and then betray your sleep, and the river made a softer shape with its mouth when he said her name.\n\nIt is possible to love an enemy the way a locksmith loves a door. The Curator proved it by showing up at strange hours with permits he had decided to ignore and a willingness to carry folding chairs. He had decided to defect from a piece of his salary and it had cost his jaw an unhappy tension; lowercase does not survive revolution well. He told them about the board where the brand-safety man had a seat, about the old donor whose child had never had to count steps in the dark and had convinced fairness that it was a synonym for content moderation. He told them the routes the security men took and the spot under the tram where a third envelope had been planned, and he confessed that he had used to believe in stitchable communities until he heard a drain say no. He inched toward a name people could say without wanting to roll it in flour, and in the meantime Twyning called him by a nonsense word that meant \u201cnot enemy yet,\u201d and it sat well on him.\n\nThe bearded man returned with his superior, who was a superior in the old way, the way that has several suits in a closet and a house that will never forgive its own mortgage because both parties have agreed to pretend the other is important. They pushed for injunctions and sent letters stamped with a red that had never seen blood or beets. Mavery printed their faces on paper, put hearts around them, and taped them to the underside of a pedestrian bridge where the pigeons could review their expressions. The city\u2019s affection is hungry for a particular kind of shame, and the men found themselves recognized in bakeries where they had never paid with cash and looked over their shoulders under the eyes of laundries that had recorded their grandmothers\u2019 skirts. They signed something they did not have time to read and found themselves rebranded away from ritual management and toward flood insurance, which made them sad because terror is less marketable when it is honest.\n\nJallo, who had given up sleep for a week and had started to speak to the coffee machine as if it were a friend whose character could be improved, made a map of wrong knots with a pencil and a thread stolen from a grandmother\u2019s repair basket. He traced the line from the docks to the nameless bridge to the Spindle to the tram and saw that somebody tried to make a neat square in a city that hates squares unless they are made of bread. He brought the map to the pool and pinned it to the bulletin board next to a flyer for a dance class for people whose knees tell the truth, and as he did it his hand paused over the nameless bridge and drew a circle without meaning to. Jana saw the circle and felt the twine-and-sins knot pull, and she said \u201cwe go now\u201d like promise and hunger braided, and Twyning nodded because it was the hour when adults do things children ought not to.\n\nThey went with the Curator carrying a stool and Mavery carrying a secret, and the river took a breath that wasn\u2019t drama, just preparation. The nameless bridge wore its vines like an inaccurate history, and the knot beneath it listened with a severity that made even the smart-mouths in the group swallow their lines. You could not cut this one. To cut would be to teach the city that old things have to defend themselves with a lawsuit, and this one would have lost, and then who would keep knives honest. Twyning took a slice of stale bread from her bag, and the stale mattered because fresh suggests you can afford to bake every day and compromise works only if you admit your pantry. Mavery put on the ground a candle that smelled like soap and rain and burned almost not at all because air here was a cousin of water. Jana took the razor and laid it heavy on the rail; that meant she would use her voice instead of her steel and it was the larger concession of the two.\n\nLen\u2019s aunt came because none of their mouths knew the oldest rituals and hers did. She wore a coat like a ship and shoes of a geometry that cities respect. She did not like soup when it has too much pepper, and she had a story that began with Now because she woke to owls in a dormitory and the night nurse had no sugar for her tea and the girl in the bed across had a cough that took her three winters later fixed to a man\u2019s chest and would not be quiet. She said it slow like hem stitch, and at the right place she put in a detail about twine because that was the debt this knot had asked for. The city is practical; it pays attention when you get the costuming right. Jana lifted her own hair and tied a single long strand to the fringe of the old knot, not to own it or dress it, but to leash herself to its mercy for the length of a breath. The Curator did the humble thing and gave one hair in view of his own lowercased pride, and Twyning laundered a coin with spit in a grandmother\u2019s gesture that ignores germs and attends to bad luck, and she pressed it into the knot with a thumb that will ache when the rain is honest. The knot shifted. That is all the kind of agreement you can expect from grandmothers with knives. It shifted and listened as if someone had finally answered a question and not just responded.\n\nThe old thing took its tithe. For three nights people sat under bridges and told stories that had to be true for once and had to be about shame and kindness and vegetables and being wrong about someone and paying later on purpose. There were no drones because detecting sincerity is above their grade. Command sent one caretaker with a clipboard to each sitting and told them to collect data, and each caretaker put the clipboard under their chair and learned a story and then went home and slept without having to count breaths to trick their heart into slowing. The pipes settled into their older song, a major key clink that no conservatory would praise because it was too necessary. The bearded man wrote a think piece and nobody bought it because the city had turned its head to listen elsewhere and missed his performance.\n\nJana went to see the girl with the razor on the string and found her sitting on a balcony with her hair in a tight coil like a snake that has decided to nap instead of bite. They talked about wrists and risk and the way a thing can sing you into stupidity if you let its hum take your balance, and then they went under the balcony and tied a scumble that said not here without showing off while a boy in a shirt that made a noise when he moved tried to make a joke and failed and felt better because failure in front of women who do not mock you is rare and restorative.\n\nTwyning met a woman on a bench with a bag of bread that had been meant for pigeons and convinced her that pigeons do better on pretensions than on carbohydrates, and they fed the bread to a girl who had sung her throat sore telling the truth three nights and needed something to line it with. Jallo went to see a priest and confessed to stealing a contract and was absolved with a laugh that tasted like onions and paper, and he went back to his desk and took three calls from boys who had been brave in the wrong direction and wanted someone older to tell them it would not be a habit if they did not let it be. The Curator collected a new card from his office that said Consultant and brought it to Twyning to ask if he should keep it. She told him to write Auntie\u2019s Boy on the back and show it to anyone who wanted to hire him to make myth into metrics, and he walked away laughing and then stopped because there was a knot of anger in his chest he had mistaken for conviction for years and he needed to undo it with salt and with apologies.\n\nOn the fourth night the old knot sent a sign as odd as any they had seen. A bundle of twine had been left under the nameless bridge, tied around a chunk of ballast worn smooth by a thousand river mouths and four floods, and stuffed inside were three items that came from different centuries and endured the same city: a bus ticket with the ink half-slept off by a pocket with lint, a needle rusted to a romantic color, and a butter knife with a mother-of-pearl handle that would have lived in a drawer beside acceptable lies and holiday napkins. Mavery unwrapped them as if in front of a camera though there wasn\u2019t one, and Jana recognized the ugliness and utility of each and felt a dignity rise in her that had nothing to do with notoriety. Twyning took the knife and used it to slice an onion over a pot and cried from the onion and from the thought that someone had chosen the right relic for this soup, and they fed the neighborhood until the bowl was polished by repetition and the old knot breathed out through the vines like a woman at a window watching her street up to the hour it is safe to sleep.\n\nThe quiet challenge of the envelope returned with dawn, slid under a door by a hand that had begun to learn how to repress flourish. The sentence on this paper was different. It said: now I will listen if you will teach, and it was signed not with a name but with a drawing of a figure-eight that crossed itself at a point slightly higher than the chalk version, as if the writer believed in breath held a second too long before laughter, which is a kind of vanity but less deadly than many. Jana put the page beside the knot in her palm that had been tied by him earlier and saw that taste, under discipline, could migrate toward usefulness. Twyning placed her finger on the dot where the figure-eight met and said a word that women keep to themselves because it loses value when men polish it with their mouths. Mavery wrote the name of the bearded man\u2019s sponsor on a piece of tape and stuck it to the sole of her shoe so she could grind it on pavement without fuss.\n\nThere were still boys printing splurges in kitchens, but now they were likely to walk to a bridge and sit outside the circle and listen until their shoulders stopped trying on shapes they could not afford. There were still knives tied to strings on balconies, but now they were being used to slice bread, and the cuts that happened were the kind that tell you how to hold your fingers forever afterward. There were still men with cards in their pockets that said they owned the undercity, and those cards still worked in rooms where the air-conditioning had been instructed to compel the poor to wear sweaters, but in the drains names had changed. Under Angel\u2019s Crossback someone had scrawled in soot and soap: Pay with attention. Under the Spindle, a child had written home in a sharp childish hand and drawn a figure-eight the size his fingers could comfortably manage. Under the nameless bridge, the old knot heard it all and worked a little faster because knitting for company is kinder than knitting alone.\n\nIt rained. Real rain, not bottled, not perplexed through cartridges, the sort that cities loathe for their own reasons and love because afterwards they are forgiven for a day. The gates held in a manner that makes workers curse and admire their own luck. Rell at the controls fell asleep in her chair for ten minutes and dreamed of beans growing up in polite green steps over the third stair where the water had once promised to move in. Twyning kept a towel around her neck and her mouth ready to speak a sentence that would keep foolishness off the rail. Jana stood barefoot in a puddle until the bottoms of her feet told her a story about childhood she had not consented to hear and did not object to. Mavery hung a string from the lifeguard chair and watched rain bead along it into her cup, and she drank and told nobody that it tasted like a very old woman carrying a knife under her skirt so a man would talk less and work more, because some compliments you keep to yourself to use like coin when the city forgets you paid last time.\n\nThe day ended as workdays end in cities that have earned their sleep. There were fewer drones, and the ones that came were baffled and ended up filming soup, which was good tape but stubbornly unprofitable. There were more chalk marks, some drawn wrong, some corrected by muffled household hands. There were in-boxes filled with questions about ritual submitted by men who spelled it correctly and meant revenue, and there were women outside Council doors with prepared stories and no compulsion to smile. There were curtains drawn back and lines for bread made shorter by boys who understood that lines indicate a possibility you are expected to honor. There were knots tied right and knots tied wrong and the knowledge that neither would stay unless someone fed them with attention like yeast.\n\nThey slept that night because the old knot had accepted payment and because the city was too tired to be clever. They slept because soup had been consumed and pickles had been removed where appropriate and a man with a dog on his shoulder had been told to sit and his value in the economy of fear had been correctly discounted. They slept because in the pool a candle that smelled like soap burned out and left only clean air behind. They slept because the sentence had done its work and would do it again and because now and home were not just words but plumbing, and the pipes appreciated that. They slept because tomorrow there would be more boys with cartridges, and more contracts written by men who call themselves stewards and mean owners, and more bridges that wanted necklaces, and because they had decided to be the sort of tired you wear as a ribbon, not the sort that makes you mean.\n\nIn the morning the envelope lay at the threshold again, and this time the hair tied in the knot was gray and wiry as wire scrubbers and looped as if the fingers that tied it had arthritis. It smelled not of rain, not of grapes, not of fear, but of flour and oil and coins, a grandmother\u2019s pocket. There were no words. There was a crumb of bread stuck in the twist. Jana laughed quietly at nothing and everything and kissed her thumb and pressed it to the knot as she had once pressed it to men\u2019s brows, and Twyning nodded like a captain whose ship has finally learned to like the ocean and who can sleep in storms if the ropes sing correctly. They went back to work because the work was older than them and would outlast them, and that is a relief when you choose not to be the center of a city but its decent gravity.",

They lied. Or maybe greed invented a new kind, a city-grown thing with the knotted patience of weeds forcing through concrete, the same green insistence in the pupil when the pupils are shot wide by the promise of money. The sort of creature that wraps itself in our language and smiles from the dark of a drain.\n\nJana learned to keep her breath silent. She could slow each draw and hide it inside the rumble of a freight elevator three streets over. She could nest in a culvert while traffic passed above, face painted dull with the powdered spoil of old brick and a veil of spider silk. The splurge-gun rested against her shoulder, easy, feather-balanced, no recoil. She had built it in pieces sourced from markets that existed between districts like dreamland alleys. The purple cartridges looked like children's cough syrup poured into bullet sleeves. She liked that. The decoy, the toy. The misdirection of color.\n\nThe first boy had walked right into it. He was not a boy, she corrected herself, he had a driver's license and a belt with a copper buckle that said TOMMY in a font that wanted to be bigger than his waist. He carried his jaw forward like men in their first suits. He had the arrogance of never being preyed upon. He laughed into his phone. His skin was perfect where he shaved in the mornings and he thought he was alone. All the things a hunter listens for.\n\nJana's bare feet touched water and her toes curled with the cold. She let him hear the coin roll. The oldest lure. A little brass disc twirled and dropped on the walkway, a bright sound with a history in it. He turned his head. He bent. The bridge overhead sent down a cough of rust-dry grit like a retail snow globe. Jana shot him in the throat.\n\nThe splurge hit and bloomed. Purple, silly, quietly devastating. It gripped, it climbed the nerves, it sang underneath the skin with its proprietary hum until his laughter got trapped behind it like a fly behind a screen. He tried to shout. He gurgled instead. Not poison. Never poison. Jana didn't like poison because it wasted property, and a living, frightened man always negotiated more tenderly than a corpse. She stepped up from the culvert, squinting through the damp, thumb at the trigger for control. One more pull to catch his wrists when they flailed. See? Now we can talk. Now we can transact.\n\n\"You'll keep your eyes on me,\" she told him. \"No turning. Blink if you understand. Blink.\"\n\nHe blinked, quick, reptile, overexcited. She smiled, a small tired curving. \"Good. I like a quick learner. Here's the number. Five hundred is the floor. If you try to bargain me lower I add attachments you don't want. Blink if you have it.\"\n\nHis pupils widened. He blinked once, then furiously, then his jaw trembled with the effort of words. Jana held up a rectangle of black that hummed when presented to a bank's invisible machine. \"Hold it with your teeth. Good boy. No, don't bite. Keep your mouth gentle. You can pick the account; I already picked you.\"\n\nShe always picked by the clean lines. The ones who wore their money like cologne: you could smell it even when it wasn't on the skin. He worked for a contractor that worked for a larger contractor that washed old stories off new buildings. He had a deposit due.\n\nShe watched him move his head and watched the transaction occur. A tickle in her palm when the device read a figure. Five hundred settled. Jana felt that old ache behind her right eye, the ache that took her back to kitchens where she counted bent coins in weak light. Greed and need were not the same voice, but they sat at the same table. She kept them apart by force.\n\n\"You did well,\" she said. \"There is one thing more. Don't move.\"\n\nShe took the razor from the pouch she wore on a cord across her chest. It was older than the gun, older than most of her. The handle had belonged to a barber who sang half-remembered opera between clacks. The blade had been honed flat until it could split a hair and name the strand it belonged to. Jana dipped it in the rainwater in the small steel cup she carried and flicked it dry. She touched the man's cheek with the back of her fingers. He rattled with the need to be brave. She moved the razor.\n\nFirst his jawline. Then his cheeks. Clean, slow, no cuts; she was gentle. She took his eyebrows last and that mattered to her; it was the sign. When he cried he cried silently but the sound was everywhere, like the river against the pilings. She shaved him until he looked new, like the stone figures in the civic hall that had never been named, those anonymous martyrs soft at the edges. She wiped his face and kissed her thumb and pressed it to his brow. See? Done. Paid. Marked.\n\n\"Next time,\" she said, \"you will recognize the story when it calls. It's an old one. Pay the toll.\"\n\nThen she melted back into the culvert, into the threads that tied the undercity together, and the hum in the cartridge settled into quiet small fizzles. He would be able to move soon. He would tell them a troll took his money and shaved him. He would prove it with a mirror and a mouth that made the story ring wrong.\n\nBy dawn the river had forgotten him. He, however, remembered every small detail of the splurge's touch, and between his mirror and his phone's black eye, the story traveled.\n\nThe first time Sergeant Twyning saw one of Jana\u2019s marks, it was on the cover of a convenience store magazine. A glossy youth, pretty-mad, with the headline: TROLL TERROR? HAIRCUT OF SHAME! The words made something old move in Twyning, a muscle that hadn\u2019t been trained in years. She lit a cigaret she was technically not allowed to own inside the Brethren building and let the first breath of smoke fill the small square between her sternum and her coat.\n\n\"Put that out,\" said Jallo from the door, but he didn't mean it, or he meant it as a courtesy, a line from a script. The Brethren like their scripts. They like their white halls and the recycled air and the way the doors seal your intentions in.\n\nTwyning had been a caretaker so long that caretaking had become a bone habit. You spool fiber through a city and somebody has to keep the spool from snarling. The district used to call them wardens; the newer term sounded gentler. Caretaker. Like they might be hired to water your houseplants. It made people easier when the whistles blew. She wore it well because she could speak to grandmothers in stairwells and they fed her soup, and she could stand in front of a riot with the same spoon and tell them no. Under the badge she wore the breath of someone who used to be a soldier and never got an honorable write-off. There was a little stitched prayer in her pocket that a woman in the Brethren had given her the day the water came up over the third step.\n\n\"That thing again?\" Jallo thumbed at the magazine, his face thin as a spade, his hairline drawn back in near-perfect geometry.\n\n\"It's not a haircut,\" Twyning said, hearing her voice heavier than she meant. \"It's a mark. It says: I found you. It says: you can't hide in your face.\"\n\n\"God. You actually read it.\"\n\n\"I can read something without believing it. And my job is to read.\"\n\nJallo leaned on the doorframe. He wore the white of a junior less like a promise and more like a borrowed shirt, too big, rumpled where he thought no one would see. \"Care sent a notification out,\" he said, \"about somebody in Drain Four. Lads keep coming to Guards with their eyebrows gone and their savings light. It's been a week. Command says we keep it to property crime, for the time being.\"\n\n\"Command says a lot of things. What does Command call it when someone breaks the law in a way that makes people start to speak a language they thought was folklore.\"\n\n\"I think that's called 'Branding.'\"\n\nTwyning made a sound that meant almost a laugh. \"Where's the lad?\"\n\n\"Down at First Aid. They say he's embarrassed but safe.\" Jallo's smile was a thin coin, warmed by someone else's hand. \"They say it's a prank. The word 'prank' came up nine times.\"\n\n\"Nine's a spell number,\" Twyning said. \"Did they tell the press?\"\n\n\"You think we control that now? The press were waiting when we fetched him off the rail.\"\n\nTwyning folded the magazine and tucked it under her arm like it was evidence, which it wasn't, not technically. It felt like it had weight anyway. She put her cigarette out against the door metal in a gesture of apology she did not feel. The Brethren liked their walls clean. They liked their caretakers tidy. She went where the boy was.\n\nHe looked like he wasn't used to needing help. He was in the big chair with the machine that huffed under him, bright at the edges with the smell of antiseptic. He had the look of a person who had once been hit in the face by a tree: stunned, angry with himself for not moving, ashamed of the way the bruise refuses to be private. He covered his head with a crocheted blanket that said PROPERTY OF CLINIC in letters so cheerful they might have been singing.\n\n\"You Sergeant Twyning?\" he said, looking at the floor.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. She pulled a chair out of habit, positioned herself so her knees framed his. \"I'm here to make sure that if someone did this there can be consequences, and if you did this there's nothing further to bother you. I've seen more serious.\"\n\nHe laughed. It came out as a hiccup. \"It's not serious. It's stupid.\"\n\n\"Stupid hurts more than serious,\" she said. \"Tell me. All of it. Tell me exactly. I won't make a face. I have practice.\"\n\n\"I don't want to tell you.\"\n\n\"That's the thing with me. I keep asking.\"\n\nThe boy picked at the blanket edge, the yarn already fuzzed from other hands. He tried to make the story small. It insisted on being large. Twenty minutes later he had told her about the coin sound, about the purple foam that held him without bruising, about the way it felt like being sung to wrong. He told her the money, he told her the card, he told her the razor. He cried when he said she took his eyebrows last. Then, embarrassed by his tears, he laughed again, strangled, and said: \"I look like an idiot. My mates are calling me Mr. Clean. I shouldn't have told my mates.\"\n\n\"You'd be worse off if you'd told nobody,\" Twyning said. \"There are men and women and in-betweens who go home with their throats cut because they don't want the world to know they let somebody touch their neck. Your shame is not a duty. Not here. Try not to pay it.\"\n\nHe sniffed. He wiped his face with the taken edge of the blanket. \"You're not like the others.\"\n\n\"I'm older than the others.\"\n\n\"You look like one of those statues. No offense.\"\n\n\"None taken. They haven't shaved me yet.\"\n\nHe made a face, then looked up as if he had heard his own courage misbehave. \"She was... she wasn't like I imagined. Not big. Not small, either. She talked like, like she had a job and this was part of her job. She told me what to do. And I wanted to do it. That's the worst of it.\"\n\nTwyning thought of the magazine. The froth of it, the merchandise. She thought of the old story that a troll takes coin and hair. She thought of the bridges still standing in the parts of the city where the high water hadn't eaten the roads.\n\n\"Did she have a name?\"\n\nHe hesitated. \"She said, 'You can call me Jana,' like a joke. Like the name itself was a trick.\"\n\n\"It probably is. Names have work to do.\" Twyning stood. The boy flinched and then apologized for flinching. \"You'll be all right,\" she said. \"You may feel a little haunted if you liked the way she organized you. That goes away. Eventually. Try not to buy anything from anyone online who says they can fix your eyebrows with a kit. If they can fix them, they'll also steal them.\"\n\nHe laughed like a cough. Then his face went quiet. \"They said it's happening all over. Messages from my cousin in the North. Some guy by the docks in Santiago. A girl in Haverfell who shaved her boyfriend to prove she's brave.\"\n\nTwyning looked at him. \"You're very observant. You'll live longer than your mates.\"\n\n\"They're going to do a challenge, aren't they? On their channels.\"\n\n\"They are. They will. And they will be sorry for awhile and then they'll pretend they weren't.\"\n\nShe left him and stood in the hall. The light there had the washed-out look of winter mornings even in summer. She put the magazine in a bin marked for paper. She took it out again. She went to her small desk in the room that had once been a closet for mops and had been upgraded to an office when the Brethren decided caretakers should have windows. Her window looked at the hospital. She looked back. She had the feeling of being looked at from below.\n\nJallo came in without knocking. \"Your eyebrows look great, if anybody asks.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Go away.\"\n\n\"Command says to put patrol on the bridges, show presence.\"\n\n\"Presence is a substance,\" she said, \"and has its uses. But if this Jana is what I think she is, she lives in the angles and tunnels. Put a uniform on a bridge and she'll put a poster of his face on the drain wall with hearts around it.\"\n\n\"What do you think she is?\"\n\n\"A troll,\" said Twyning. She tasted the word. It was not stupid on the tongue. \"I think she is a way of making money. And I think she's ritualized it because ritual robs us of our shame.\"\n\n\"Command says not to use fairytale terms in reports.\"\n\n\"I'll be sure to call her a serial mugger with signature.\"\n\n\"You can't help yourself, can you?\" Jallo loved her because she made him feel the long line behind him. Loved her like a child loves a stubborn old dog it can't keep for much longer. \"There's something else. Someone leaked a video. The shave part. It's on everything.\"\n\n\"Show me.\"\n\nHe showed her. It was a smear, a surreptitious capture from someone's window across. Jana was a blur with a careful hand. The man was a geometry of stiffness and trembling. The sound was a river and a song in a language nobody claimed. The camera shake made it worse, more real, less. At the end Jana put her thumb on his brow like a blessing and the camera stopped. The comments rolled like rain.\n\nTwyning watched the numbers climb. She felt the little bones in her ear grind where they had been broken in another life. \"They'll love her,\" she said. \"They love neat violence and people who believe in their work.\"\n\n\"They're already making jokes. The police in New Attlee are saying it's a fraternities thing. Pranking. Hazing.\"\n\n\"And in a week,\" she said, \"someone will die.\"\n\nHe looked like he didn't want to know she was right. He always looked like that, which was one reason she kept him around her. She kept people who were not yet convinced that she could predict ugliness.\n\n\"How do we find her?\" he said. \"How do you catch a story.\"\n\n\"It bites its tail because it doesn't know where else to end,\" she said. \"We put a question in front of it and see if it answers.\"\n\nTwyning didn't go to the bridges. She went under them. She went in uniform, because uniforms had certain rights and caused certain confusions, and because she didn't like to pretend. Her boots remembered the slope of the old milky stones. Her hand remembered the way to lift a curtain of vines without breaking the stem where it fed. The water smelled like money and old laundry. The iron under the bridges whispered, rust pitched high like a child's singing.\n\n\"You're too old for this,\" she told herself. \"You're too old to chase girls into pipes.\" She went anyway.\n\nThere were marks. They were\u2014 what: notches? Tokens? The way children mark how tall they've grown against a wall until the wall is a graph of hunger. There were little thumbprints of purple on brick, half-hidden under the chalk tags of teenagers and the condolence notes they write to themselves when a boy goes in the water and doesn't come out. There were slick places where feet had worn a path, but the city is full of those. The river is a legible book if you know the script.\n\nUnder the fourth bridge, the one \u0441alled Angel's Crossback for a soldier who once died there twice in the stories, she found a thing. It was not a big thing. It was a blade-steel hair that had been tied into a knot that couldn't exist. She held it on her palm. It flashed when it caught the lane of clean daylight. She did not know the trick. She pocketed it. She looked up and saw a child on the rail watch her, and the child's mouth shaped the word: troll.\n\nShe made the kid a face that said don't be afraid and go away now in the same breath. The kid went. The river smiled, full of teeth.\n\nBy the time the sun angled home the news had shifted. In New Attlee a woman called Torolina decided to shave her boyfriend live while a purple balloon hung over her bed \"for color.\" He struggled. He laughed. The laugh snapped off and the feed ended and his throat had a line across it when they found him. They said it was an accident, or a fight, or an accident of a fight. The throw of the story was already wrong.\n\nBy midnight there were copycats in Cape Town and in Kyiv and in Kentish New. Most were pranks. Some were worse. An ocean away a boy with a new splurge-gun printed cheap in a kitchen made a mess of his friend. The death counter, the one the stations will not admit to but watch with feral attention, changed number with a little, almost-joyful click. Exponential is a word we give to the way things mate in darkness. It looked like that.\n\nJana watched it all from a room that was once a locker space for a pool that had been emptied of water when the city started rationing. She liked dry pools. They reminded her of gods who had lost their patience and gone away. The tiles echoed her steps. She had a mattress under the lifeguard chair because irony suited her between jobs. There were little lines on the wall where the chlorine had wept down over a decade of hands and laughter and bodies and then stopped. She warmed her hands over the battery heater and counted her money. She wasn't much for counting except when counting meant she would not have to listen to any man's explanation ever again.\n\n\"You're a little famous,\" said a voice from the doorway, knowing exactly how to say both little and famous at the same time like a pain. Jana did not startle. Mavery was a thin woman with a face like a well made of scars and sweetness. Mavery sold devices and listened to frequencies. She knew where the markets went when they wanted to be private. She had found Jana a cartridge supplier and a way to know when a bank got anxious. She walked barefoot even in glass.\n\n\"You shouldn't use doors you don't own,\" Jana said. \"I might take a razor to you and you'll have to eat through a straw.\"\n\n\"Promises,\" Mavery said. She came and crouched and peered into Jana's pile. \"So many blues and warm oranges. You could buy yourself a car.\"\n\n\"I don't like cars. They make promises they can't keep.\"\n\n\"You could buy yourself a pardon.\"\n\n\"They sell those now? The Brethren really are pivoting.\"\n\nMavery smiled. \"You scared, little troll?\"\n\n\"Of whom.\"\n\n\"The ones who love you. They'll ruin you first, then they'll turn on you. They're not your friends.\"\n\n\"I don't have friends.\"\n\n\"I am your friend.\"\n\n\"You're my supplier, and my conscience that keeps telling me to change the color of the cartridges so the Boy Scouts don't die by accident.\"\n\n\"You listen every other Thursday,\" Mavery said, stepping on the butt of one of Jana's jokes and flattening it. \"I brought you a copycat count. It's going to give you a tickle.\"\n\n\"I don't care.\"\n\n\"You do. You plan on a territory. You plan on a harvest. You don't want a boy with a sugar-water squirt gun tipping your markets and making the mothers take weapons classes.\"\n\n\"Let the mothers,\" Jana said. \"They're known to be good shots.\"\n\n\"You're sour because the boy you shaved yesterday had prettier skin than yours,\" Mavery said, patient. \"Here. It's already in the high hundred. The death pieces are small, but the trending is jagged. The algorithm thinks you\u2019re a dance.\"\n\nJana did care and hated that. She took the device and read the little lines. \"Little birds will always think they're hawks.\"\n\n\"I love your metaphors. They're like knives that forgot to be buttered.\" Mavery sat on the edge of the lifeguard chair, swinging her legs like a child. \"The Brethren put a woman on you.\"\n\n\"No, a woman put herself on me. The Brethren don't have that kind of taste.\"\n\n\"Sergeant Twyning. Caretaker. They call her the Quiet Stalker. Not to her face. She walked a battalion out of a ditch once with a broken loudspeaker and a pocketful of chalk. My friend says she used to talk to snipers like she was their aunt and they none of them shot her because she did the thing with the voice.\"\n\nJana, against her will, felt curiosity shift in her mouth. \"The thing with the voice.\"\n\n\"You know the thing. The voice you had when you told the boy to blink.\"\n\n\"Stop watching me through other people's windows.\"\n\n\"I can't. You're good tape. Also if the mothers arm themselves like I told you, it will be better if there is a woman out there who knows how to make them put the guns down. You're a selfish thing, Jana. But not all bad.\" Mavery reached into her tunic and brought out a wrapped bundle. She unwrapped it like a gift and the unwrap itself made content. \"Here. Found you a different purple. This one stains like shame. Lasts forty-eight hours. Washes off when they cry under hot water. The chemical bond is intrusive and it smells like grapes. Which is disgusting but\u2014\"\n\n\"Good,\" Jana said. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for my own sense of humor. The boys will smell like grapes for two days and their lads will make jokes about wine and they'll want to die.\"\n\n\"I don't want them to die.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Mavery said. \"But they are dying now. And not because of you. Because they want to be you, or they want to be yours. That's how it goes.\"\n\n\"Don't turn this into a fable,\" Jana said, but she held the cartridges like a child holds her mother's lost hairpin.\n\nNight pressed on the empty pool and all the sounds were magnified. Out the window, a siren wrote its long sentence along the block. Jana sat cross-legged and thought about bridges. The thing with the voice. She had learned it from watching nuns talk a drunk down from a steeple. Not her nuns. She had no nuns. But the city offers you almost everything if you are patient enough to accept its gifts out of harm's hand.\n\nTwyning did not sleep so much as do little sums with her eyes closed on the bed that pretended to be a sofa in the caretaker room. She wore socks because the floor conducted cold like a gossip. In her mind she laid string. Bridge to drain. Coin to bank. Blade to ritual. She made the shape the story had agreed to be and then she set the shape against other shapes and waited for the friction where they overlapped. That is where you set your trap. She turned and the little prayer in her pocket scratched her stomach through the fabric and she didn't mind. She imagined offering a sandwich to a girl with bare feet in the wet and the girl not taking it. She imagined war as a song. Different wars. Same song. Exponential. No one rehearsed for those parts; they learned in the chorus and then walked out as soloists with their mouths open the wrong way.\n\nShe woke to the sound of the wrong alarm: not the building, not the hospital, but the city-first emergency that only the caretakers could hear, a tone calibrated to taste like copper in the throat. She sat up and reached for her jacket. Jallo stumbled into the door.\n\n\"Angel's Crossback,\" he said, too pale. \"Two of them. Shot with purple. One's blueing, the other's saying the word 'grape' like it's a prayer. The press got there before we did. The kids threw things at the paramedics.\"\n\nTwyning stood. She did not bother a mirror. She pocketed the little impossible hair without thinking about it. \"By now they're throwing at everyone,\" she said. \"Call the water company and ask them to shut the bottom gate by the river.\"\n\n\"That makes the Lower Blocks flood.\"\n\n\"No, it makes them damp. But it turns Angel's Crossback into a dead end and if you want to catch a person who moves in tunnels you take away the tunnels one at a time.\"\n\n\"You'll get fired.\"\n\n\"I've been fired in every uniform I've ever worn. Then they hired me back because the people they replaced me with were good and I am not good, I'm useful. Do it.\"\n\nHe went, swearing, loving her. She went, walking like a person with nothing to prove. When she reached the bridge the air was thick with bad questions and lights that made everyone's fear look like a fashion show. She walked through the cordon. She knelt by the boy who could only say \"grape\" and smiled as if it were their first day of school and she was handing him a pencil. He stopped saying it and he said, \"She smelled like penny.\" He meant copper. He meant the taste of the alarm.\n\n\"Good lad. Very good. Remember that you are not the worst thing that happened today. Remember that you survived.\" She stood. She made the shape of her trap by moving her men. There were not many men. There were women in orange and elders in brown. There were kids on rails filming her so they could edit her into a witch. She let them. Witches were sometimes right.\n\nThen, because she needed something old to wake, she went under, into the drain, into the dark that had her name scratched in it from twenty-four years ago. The water company liked her enough to do as she asked. The lower gates trembled and closed. The current softened. The undercity held its breath.\n\nJana felt the water slack and turned her head like an animal in a forest looking toward the tree that had changed its mind about falling. She had been planning to slip under the river and pop out five blocks away like a magic trick. Now the trick's floor had vanished. She smiled without fixing it. It had been a while since a caretaker did something clever. \"Well, then,\" she said to the air. \"We will be polite about this.\"\n\nShe took her splurge and checked the gauge. Where she crouched the wall sweated. There were names written in soot, old ones and new. People practiced their letters underground. The words did not like the light.\n\nThe first time she saw the woman coming it was a silhouette with a haircut that had never been shaved against its will. The second time it was a voice that didn't bend to echo. The third time it was a pair of eyes that had a capacity for sorrow in them large enough to float a house. Jana, who never apologized for what she was, felt that apology-like pain in her chest settle and look up.\n\n\"Jana,\" the voice said, and did the thing with the name: not asking, not accusing, just laying the cloth. \"We've been walking toward each other all week.\"\n\n\"Sergeant,\" Jana said. \"If I come up you'll do that thing where you make all my money look silly.\"\n\n\"I will take you somewhere safe and I will keep idiots from copying you with real weapons. I will make a room where people can't shoot you with their phones. I will try. And then I will listen, and then I will charge you. These things are all true.\"\n\n\"There's a tax on everything,\" Jana said. \"I'm the one who says that.\"\n\n\"Taxes make civilizations. Tolls make bridges. You and I might agree on more than you think. Please come up.\"\n\n\"Please,\" Jana repeated, delighted. \"Do you know how long it has been since anyone with a badge said please.\"\n\n\"I say it all the time. Everyone hears it as an order. They do what they were taught.\" Twyning stepped closer. There was fluid in the drain a hand's width deep. She put her foot in and made no face. \"Mavery told me you are better than the people who love you. Mavery is sometimes right.\"\n\nJana did not change expression, only her pupils. \"Mavery talks.\"\n\n\"Mavery sings. You know that.\"\n\n\"Why should I come up. The world is better when I am under it. The city is more itself. It has its story again.\"\n\n\"The story isn't yours,\" said Twyning, very simply, although nothing had ever been simple in her mouth. \"You made a mark so others could find you. Now they've found the mark and they think they own it. They are shaving their friends and killing their friends and broadcasting sorrow that looks like advertisement. You are greedy. I know greed. So be greedy for the shape of your story. Don't let them ruin it. Come up.\"\n\nJana thought of the boy who had said Mr. Clean and then had cried like a child with soap in his eyes. She thought of grape. She thought of scarcity. She lifted the splurge a fraction, not to shoot: she wanted to remind herself what she was. She did not lift it further. Her bare toes curled with the wet.\n\n\"I came here to shave a man who beats his wife,\" she said. \"I do good, sometimes, sergeant. I've been told. He has a tattoo of a dog on his shoulder and he calls it courage.\"\n\n\"You do good as a side effect of your wants. That is better than never doing it. If you come up, you can point me at him, and I will go to his house with a sandwich in my pocket and a warrant in my shoe. I will do my job. And you will do yours, which is\u2014 I don't know yet. You'll tell me. Come up.\"\n\n\"You're very sure I won't shoot you in the throat.\"\n\n\"I am not at all sure,\" said Twyning. She took one more step, into the thin water, into the list of names that had never been read out loud. \"But I asked. I said please. And I would like to hear you say my name because then we will be more equal.\"\n\n\"Equality is a tax, too,\" Jana said. She smiled the soft smile that has undone men in wars and weddings. \"Twyning,\" she said, tasting it, making it hers. \"Twyning. It tastes like old rope.\"\n\n\"It tastes like salt,\" said Twyning. \"Come up.\"\n\nThe sound from above shifted, subtle as a breath. Jana watched it in the way light fractured on the drain-water surface. A crowd leaned wrong. A child shouted. A glass bottle rolled. She felt the copycats up there, practicing their swagger, folding their faces into a mask she had made with her fingers. She made a choice. It didn't feel like anything at all. Choices seldom do.\n\nShe came up but not as surrender. She walked into the mouth of the drain like a woman stepping through a curtain backstage. The hole made a frame around her and the camera lenses drank her hard. She didn't care about the camera lenses because the only pair of eyes that mattered were five feet from her, watching like a woman watches a tide. She lifted the splurge and felt the crowd flinch collectively and she smiled to show her very small teeth.\n\n\"The man with the dog on his shoulder,\" she said. \"He lives in the brown Muscovy under the damp graffiti of a name that was once 'Lice' and then 'Nice' and then 'Lice' again. His wife wears pink slippers and she keeps her hair long because she thinks it will save her from something. I am greedy. I want to take his eyebrows. Your turn, Sergeant. Do you like pickles on your sandwiches. I don't. It's a flaw.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Twyning, who had the sense to accept a gift as a gift and not make it tax at once. \"I will take the pickles off for you. Put down the gun so I can give you your sandwich. I'm a woman of my word.\"\n\nNobody heard that line except the two of them. The others heard the words but not the promise because everyone was editing their own story in their head at that moment. Everybody wanted to cut a version where they were brave and righteous and one day their kids would ask what they did and they could say: I was there at the bridge when they took the troll out of the drains. Someone's mother cried because she thought her son would be the one to die today. Someone's father wondered how much the clips would sell for in the old coin markets. The water smell got into the hair of everybody present and they would keep catching it when they walked past clean rooms for weeks.\n\nJana shifted the splurge. She put it on the ground. She kept the razor. She never didn't. She took the sandwich out of the air when Twyning gave it. It was the worst sandwich she'd ever eaten. It was almost perfect. It tasted like someone who knew that you survive on bread when bread is all there is decided there should also be a sweetness, once in a while, to remind you of your teeth. She took a bite and the grape smell rose from her hands where the cartridges had leaked a little. The wrong kind of memory. The crowd laughed and gagged and shouted and delaminated like a bad poster in rain.\n\nBehind them, downriver, the number changed again on a screen in a room that didn't admit to existing. A producer clapped and a politician practiced a look. A girl in a country that was a republic and a monarchy and a colony all at once tied a razor to a string and spun it until it sang. The death count climbed and the angle of the climb steepened because that is what angles do when everyone agrees not to be boring any longer.\n\nTwyning stepped close enough that Jana could have cut her if she wanted to. Jana didn't. \"I will walk with you,\" the sergeant said. \"I will not hold your arm because you are not my prisoner yet. But you are also not mine to lose.\"\n\n\"I'm nobody's,\" Jana said reflexively, and then swallowed the word like a bit of stale bread. \"I might be the city's. A little bit.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Twyning. \"We are all pieces they forgot to sweep after the party.\"\n\nThey walked. The cameras folded their content. The copycats watched and learned all the wrong lessons. Jallo made a hero's face because he thought it would help someone, and maybe it did. On the rail, the child who had written the word troll with his mouth pointed and turned to his brother and said, \"See? It's like when you go to the dentist. They make you open your mouth. It's not about your teeth. It's about the chair.\" And the brother nodded like that made any sense at all.\n\nBehind them, under Angel's Crossback, the impossible hair that Twyning had taken from the wall sat warm against her hip, and if it had been a story it would have woken and asked to be told. But it wasn't a story. Not yet. It was a knot she couldn't untie with a knife. It was a sign. It was a tax. It would be waiting when they went to sleep and when they woke, and everything the city invented between those hours would be, as ever, both brand-new and ancient as a toll collected in a language no one now pronounces right.",

                              "content": "They walked with a steady slowness that made the crowd\u2019s noise fold over itself and exhaust, a kind of reverse wave where expectation met boredom and turned to commentary. Twyning held the shape of the space between her and Jana like a fence made from hands and calendar pages; she had learned how to make an absence do the work of a wall. Jallo flanked them with his clipboard and his too-new boots and the kind of face a mother would forgive for bringing home a stray, and the cameras tried to sluice around his edges, but he was a better dam than he looked. When a boy stepped forward holding his phone in both hands like a sacrament, Twyning said, in that schoolroom voice that made bad choices put their heads down for a second, \u201cThank you, not now,\u201d and the boy found himself listening to a woman from a decade he had seen only in remastered clips.\n\nThe Brethren van was not a cage. Jana saw that and let herself be amused by it without relaxing. The interior was scarred white, the kind of clean that remembers filthy days, and it smelled like peppermints someone had spilled in an emergency. Jallo opened the side door and then remembered to look at Twyning to see if opening doors was still his privilege. Twyning nodded because commanding is a shared pastime when you\u2019re tired. Jana swung in without showing the blade of her foot. The splurge lay on the floor between them like a candy someone had dropped and nobody wanted to be caught picking up.\n\n\u201cNot straight to Command,\u201d Jana said, glancing out at the angle of the bridge. \u201cYou promised me pickles off a sandwich and a dog on a shoulder.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promised you pickles off a sandwich. The dog-man is an intention. Intentions need sequencing if you don\u2019t want to lose your appetite,\u201d said Twyning. She had that air of someone who had eaten field rations and could therefore hold off a hunger bawling at her ankles for an extra hour. \u201cIf we walk to Muscovy directly, the press will gild it until it stops being a visit and becomes a pilgrimage. The woman in the slippers will have to move, even if I take him. I want her to stay until she wants to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes she ever want to go,\u201d Jana said, and it wasn\u2019t a question so much as a diagnosis. She folded her legs under her on the bench as if she were in someone\u2019s kitchen. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll play your game first if you play mine second.\u201d\n\nJallo inhaled as if to declare nothing like that could be written on a form and then exhaled because he had been around Twyning long enough to know forms arrived after the story, not before. \u201cWe have fifteen minutes of privacy,\u201d he said, which meant two. \u201cCommand wants to see if you can be made to sit still. They have scripts.\u201d\n\n\u201cScripts are for boys who need lines,\u201d Jana said, not unkindly. She peered at the van\u2019s ceiling and watched a spider that had made a life there move across a field of dents. \u201cI prefer improvisation. It\u2019s cheaper. It leaves more money on the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is cheaper until it costs,\u201d Twyning said, which was the closest she would get to a sermon while the city still held its breath. She leaned forward. \u201cYou killed no one. Do you know what the count is this hour for people trying to be you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stopped counting so I could keep working,\u201d Jana said, and for once there was no lacquer on her voice. \u201cThere\u2019s a smell to it now. Grapes in hot rooms. If I could repent for a scent, I would. It\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t stupid, it\u2019s a design flaw that a thousand boys adopt because it is easy to repeat,\u201d Twyning said, and she watched the little nod Jana never gave anyone, the one she had given only to gravity. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix the scent. We\u2019ll fix the ease. That\u2019s what caretaking is. You narrow the door until the wolf can\u2019t get its shoulders through.\u201d\n\nThey pulled out of the knot at the bridge. The van took a street that pretended to be a lane and then kinked back on itself the way old roads do when they\u2019ve had to learn the shape of a river twice. The gates below Angel\u2019s Crossback were still closed. The Lower Blocks had begun to consider their damp with an offended solidarity; women in plastic shoes were moving carpets onto steps, men were carrying radios that had never been allowed to touch water. Two children sailed a sheet pan and argued about who got to be the captain of a vessel with no oars.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll blame me,\u201d Jana said, watching it all through the slit of a half-raised blind. The van\u2019s windows were smoked in a just-barely legal way; the Brethren liked to see without being seen until it served them to be seen. \u201cThey\u2019ll blame the troll. It\u2019ll make them feel old and safe and angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll blame me,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cI called the gate. I\u2019ll be the one who eats bread for a week and never sees a dessert coupon again. I have been unpopular longer than you have been paid. That\u2019s another kind of protection.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you take compliments in sandwiches, too,\u201d Jana said. She felt the van breathe as if it had lungs. The city had that trick. Everything organizes itself around breath if you let it.\n\nThe Brethren building had doors that you could open with a hand and a sentence and doors that you could only open by performing a specific shame in front of a camera. Twyning took Jana through the ones that were invented when caretaking had meant war-walking, not disease counting. In a hallway that had once been a barracks they passed a mural done in paint the Brethren pretended had always been there. It showed a woman carrying a child through water that reached her waist while men on scooters filmed her. Someone had scrawled a comment bubble above the child\u2019s head. It said a word that meant \"like\" and \"hurt\" at the same time, which was a language kids had learned without lessons.\n\nMavery knew exactly which window to meet. She leaned in at a half-open pane as if it were a cousin\u2019s gossip slot and showed her teeth the way useful women do when they want to pretend affection until someone pays them. \u201cYou made a crowd watch you be somebody,\u201d she said, very softly, and it didn\u2019t reach further than Jana\u2019s earlobe. \u201cGood tape. Bad angle. They\u2019ll think you came up because the aunt told you please. They\u2019ll write you smaller if you let them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m eating a sandwich,\u201d Jana said. \u201cThe aunt kept her word. The aunt gets two more sentences for free.\u201d\n\n\u201cTorches are being manufactured as we speak. Plastic ones. They learned how to print your splurge but it jams; the cough-syrup cheapens in heat,\u201d Mavery murmured. She let her eyes flick up to Twyning and nod very slightly. Respect where it made her merchandise move. \u201cI will dirty the circuits around Muscovy for ten minutes and make the microphones forget to be on. For this gift, I want the other purple. The one that stains teeth, not faces.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a worse person than I am,\u201d Jana said, grateful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a better vendor,\u201d Mavery said. \u201cAlso your friend. Don\u2019t argue; it wastes breath you will need later.\u201d She vanished in a fold of brick and a bad potted palm whose fronds had bruises from fingers.\n\nThe room Twyning chose was small because small rooms make men\u2019s voices drop into usefulness. No cameras. No mirror pretending to be a wall. A table, two chairs, a sink that had counted hands and tears. She set the sandwich down and took the pickles off without lecture. She poured water from a bottle because the tap had a politics she didn\u2019t want to involve in this lunch.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re famous,\u201d Jallo said from the door, and it was not flattery so much as hazard signage. \u201cCommand wants an hour. After that, if you haven\u2019t given them a story they can sell as safety, someone in a blazer taller than his authority will call this a kidnapping and we will all get demoted to counting parking meters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m allergic to blazers,\u201d Jana said, chewing. \u201cThe man\u2019s tattoo is a bull terrier. It was done in a kitchen and the ears are wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d said Twyning, and she watched the way the admission eased the muscles in Jana\u2019s throat, which had been the color of someone looking at a snake that wasn\u2019t sleeping. \u201cFirst, talk to me about the knot.\u201d\n\nThe word made Jana\u2019s mouth do the thing it did when the bread was stale but there was butter, after all. She pulled her legs up and wrapped her arms around her knees the way orphan girls never entirely forget to do, and she looked at Twyning as if giving her part of a story was not a mistake but a gift that she could charge for later.\n\n\u201cYou found one,\u201d Jana said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t ask if you hadn\u2019t. They don\u2019t show themselves unless someone deserving looks. Or else someone makes them and hopes the deserving will come.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a single hair. Blade-steel. Tied like a problem. It could not be untied without salt and time. I am short on time. I have only medium salt,\u201d said Twyning. She put it on the table. The knot sat there like a trick a child does with a cherry stem and keeps for a year as a token of dexterity. \u201cTell me this palindrome before the clock eats us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re called scumbles in my mouth because my mouth likes words that smudge,\u201d Jana said. \u201cIn the old stories, the ones I pretend not to read, trolls were given bridges by saints and taxes by devils and they drew their circle with stones. In the city, stones move, and circles become maze corners. So you tie what you can\u2019t move. Hair is good because it has memory. Knots are good because they are language and trap at the same time. You take a hair from the first three you shave. You twist them into a knot that says: I live here now. It tells the old things that you will take care of the passage and demand a toll that isn\u2019t blood. It tells the new things that there is an adult in the basement. If a caretaker finds it and takes it, the contract is reviewed. The bridge remembers that human eyes have seen it and the bargain resets.\u201d\n\nTwyning turned the knot in her palm and the memory of it pressed against the lines the way a stray cat presses its cheek against a leg to make a claim. \u201cI found it in a spot where the river stutters. It was not your bridge. Was it you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tied mine under the third, under the one that drops rust flakes like sugar. Angel\u2019s Crossback should not have had my knot. So either I sleepwalk and make duplicate leases or somebody wants me to think I am larger than I am,\u201d Jana said, and the thought pleased and then alarmed her in quick succession. \u201cThere is a kind that comes after profit. They have no receipts. They do it for the look. They tie with stolen hair. They don\u2019t pay old things with soup and songs so the pipes go angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have noticed the pipes,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cThey talk to me when I fall asleep. I thought it was age.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is age,\u201d Jana said, and she grinned like a fox drawing a culture line in frost. \u201cOf everything that is not you.\u201d\n\nJallo coughed and made a tapping gesture at his wrist which meant the Command had moved from patience to mail. Twyning ignored him with old-lady impunity. She took a breath that had been earned. \u201cWe are going to Muscovy first. We will be overpolite. We will take him to a room like this and ask his wife if she wants to sign a paper that says she is safe without him. If she refuses, we will not eat our own hands. We will leave food with her. We will leave a number that rings me, not a clearinghouse. We will remember our own weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour sermon suits you because you don\u2019t enjoy it,\u201d Jana said. \u201cTeach me your voice and I\u2019ll teach you how to walk in drains the way a cat walks on piano keys. You can stop stepping on songs that don\u2019t belong to you.\u201d\n\nTwyning\u2019s smile was a line that had seen a lot of winter and refused to apologize for its cracks. \u201cDeal. After we do this thing right now.\u201d She stood and put the knot in her pocket again because she didn\u2019t believe in leaving signs on tables where men could pick them up and think they were souvenirs. \u201cJallo, tell Command that the room we are in does not exist. Use the old code. If they argue, ask them if they have their swimming badges up to date. We\u2019re closing the gates again in ten if they don\u2019t behave.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod,\u201d Jallo said, with the helpless adoration of a clerk for a field hand. \u201cI love you when you do policy by threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never threaten. I predict,\u201d said Twyning, and they moved.\n\nMuscovy had been built in a decade that liked rectangles and forgot about wind. It held its damp like a man with a secret holds a grin, tight in the corners, wider than it wants to be. The graffiti that was once \u201cLice\u201d and had become \u201cNice\u201d and then decided to be \u201cLice\u201d again had been layered like sediment; someone had tried to scrub it at some point, and the rectangle of cleaner brick made the word louder. Two men on the stoop had the patience of people who have small jobs and wait for their small jobs to start. A woman on the second-floor balcony watered geraniums with a plastic bottle that had been a sports drink once and now was a different kind of endurance.\n\nTwyning went first because there is power in being the first to put your foot on the squeaky step and not apologize. She greeted the men without making them a threat. \u201cWe came to speak to the dog-man,\u201d she said in a voice that would have made a bouncer step back and check his list. \u201cWe have a question and a sandwich. Only one of those is for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just,\u201d said the older man, and then he trailed off because she had a way of making \u201cjust\u201d sound like a luxury nobody could afford.\n\n\u201cI can just,\u201d she said pleasantly. \u201cAnd you can just let me. That would be neighborly. What\u2019s your name so I can use it when I talk to your grandmother about how polite you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cStas,\u201d he said, caught. \u201cI don\u2019t have a grandmother here.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone has a grandmother somewhere. I will tell the nearest one and she will nod because you were raised right today.\u201d\n\nJana lingered three steps behind. She watched the way fear reduced and gathered in the doorway; she watched the room like a recipe she wanted to steal. She could have slipped past and done it the simple way: a coin and a laugh and a purple sting, a neat shaving until the ink-dog sat above blank eyes and could not pretend to be brave. But the crowd had grown on the pavement and the woman in pink slippers had her face pressed to a curtain, and Jana had decided, once, in a dry pool, that there were rules that made the city better to live in even when you didn\u2019t get to be the one who wrote them.\n\nThe apartment smelled like broth and cigarettes and a shampoo that had lied on its label. The dog on the man\u2019s shoulder had been done with a needle charmed by a cousin and an oven cleaner\u2019s courage; it was a geometry of anger, more square than a dog ought to be. He didn\u2019t look like a monster. He looked like a man who had learned to put his hands in places where they had no work to do. He looked at Twyning and measured whether her coat could be convinced to be a costume.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know you,\u201d he said, trying for a long vowel in a short mouth.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d she said. \u201cSit, please. I won\u2019t embarrass you in front of your friends if you sit and make your voice fit in your throat instead of the hall.\u201d She put the sandwich on the table and she put a paper under it that had stamps on it and she put her hands flat as if she were showing him there were no weapons in them besides time.\n\nThe woman in pink slippers had beautiful hair, and Jana, who liked hair and watched what people did with it, saw the way the woman held it across her collarbone like a life vest. She made herself smaller because she knew how to watch without turning the watched into a performance. Her razor felt light and patient against her sternum.\n\n\u201cThis is a warrant for your screams,\u201d the man said, laughing at his own wit.\n\n\u201cThis is a paper that says, in boring language, that if you have been unkind with your body in this room we can move you and feed you while we decide where kindness lives,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cIf we are wrong, you will go back to your chair and eat something your neighbor burns. If we are right, you will sleep somewhere clean and maybe learn how to make soup. You will pretend to hate it. You will be grateful in your kidneys.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the sandwich and at the slippered woman and at the engraved dog, and he put every face he knew on his own until one looked useful. \u201cShe\u2019s lying,\u201d he said, pointing without looking. \u201cShe lies like some people blink. It\u2019s a habit.\u201d\n\nThe woman moved, one inch. It was a brave inch and the room noticed. \u201cI don\u2019t lie,\u201d she said, and her voice was small but accurate. \u201cI hide. You taught me.\u201d\n\nJana didn\u2019t mean to step, but she stepped. She had never been good with other people\u2019s inches. The razor in her hand made a small silver apology to the air as it turned. Twyning saw the turn and did not flinch, because flinching would make the room sharper. Her hand went out in the same breath that a mother catches a falling cup before the water hits the rug. She touched Jana\u2019s wrist without force. Jana stopped because the touch was not an order but an information: we are being filmed by a god with bad taste.\n\n\u201cLater,\u201d Twyning said, and she meant later later, the kind with furniture moved and witnesses sent home, not the kind that means never. \u201cWe\u2019ll take him now. He\u2019ll be brave in the hallway and small in the van. You can tell me his friends\u2019 names in low voice. We do this gently because if we do it hard the neighbors will pretend tomorrow that kindness is the same as conquest, and then a boy will buy a gun in a kitchen again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour math is heavy,\u201d Jana said, and she let the razor go down. The man laughed because he thought he had won. He did not know about afternoons.\n\nThey took him without breaking the table. Jallo had his polite face on, and it worked like an anesthetic. The woman in slippers looked at her geraniums as they passed and then she looked at Jana, and there was a brief electrical exchange that had no language to carry it, a sort of handover of chores. Jana wanted to take the woman\u2019s hair into her palm and tie a knot that would hang above the threshold and make the apartment remember itself, but she didn\u2019t because she had watched too many men bless women with objects and call it protection and then demand interest. She said, instead, \u201cThere is a knot under the third bridge that knows my name. If you go there and you touch it, you can say a sentence about safety and forget it later, as a trick. If you meet a policeman and he looks like a child with a clipboard, tell him to find Sergeant Twyning. She is the one who removes pickles.\u201d\n\nThe woman smiled and the smile was a broken fence that would soon be mended because someone was coming with wire. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like pickles either.\u201d\n\nOutside, the air had moved sideways into heat. News traveled faster than weather now, but the weather was catching up. Someone had tagged the word TOLL on the side of the van with a marker that smelled like sad grapes. A boy across the street filmed the ink in time lapse and added a filter that turned everything to winter. A girl posted a challenge where she shaved her boyfriend\u2019s knee and called it kneeverse good luck. A man in a tie did a segment on facial hair as heritage. The flatscreen that hung in the lobby of the building across from Muscovy had a crawl at the bottom that said: BRETHREN NEGOTIATE WITH TROLL, EXPERT SAYS: BRAND RISK OR OPPORTUNITY.\n\nOn the way back, Mavery\u2019s dirtying of circuits held long enough that the microphones recorded their own hum and the cameras made beautiful, useless loops of light. She fell in step for half a block with the van and then peeled away to sell something to a woman who made candles that smelled like fear and productivity. She knocked twice on the panel of the van as if it were a boat she wished luck. \u201cAnother knot came undone by the docks,\u201d she said through the glass, casual as weather. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t one of yours. Somebody is making counterfeit circles. They want tribute without the tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course they do,\u201d Jana said, and her shoulders did a little roll like a dog shaking off a glove. \u201cGreed never dies. It just changes brand.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you smell it,\u201d asked Twyning. She didn\u2019t mean the grapes. She meant the wrongness. She meant the flaring edges where a story takes off its own skin and runs around causing accidents.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jana said. She put her hand over the place where the razor lay, an old habit that had begun as comfort and had become, lately, a superstition. \u201cIt smells like old sugar and cheap metal. It smells like what I would be if nobody had taught me how to ask a man to blink.\u201d\n\nCommand tried to own an hour and got twelve minutes. They sat her at a table and asked her to be contrite in public in exchange for the chance to be mythic later, and Jana found herself almost laughing because of the adjacency of the words contrite and mythic. Twyning sat to her right and said absolutely nothing, which was a trick men didn\u2019t know how to do. Explainers in tidy jackets leaned on phrases about harm reduction and exploiting the moment to teach consent and weapon literacy; one of them used the term \u201cnarrative hygiene\u201d and looked very pleased with it. Jana ate the second half of her sandwich and tried not to enquire about the price of their haircuts.\n\nIt turned while they were inside, as things always turn when you look away. A boy with a printed splurge that dripped panic in blue had cornered his friend in a stairwell ten blocks north, and the friend had done the thing that doomed friendships do: laughed too loud in a small space. The cartridge jammed and burped a bloom of foam that held and then slipped. The boy with the gun panicked because panic is a muscle teenagers can outlift, and he did something with his hand, and the stair was old, and the fall was short and fatal. By the time the Brethren room breathed that news in, a mother had already recorded her grief on three platforms and a brand had bought a hashtag that didn\u2019t belong to it.\n\nJana put her forehead on the table like a woman saying grace badly. Twyning closed her eyes. Jallo swore in a language he used only in church. Command made phone calls like a puppeteer with burnt fingers. For a moment you could hear the city\u2019s heart as if it were under a stethoscope held by a beginner.\n\n\u201cWe go back under,\u201d Twyning said at last, and she said it the way you say we go back into the burning houses with buckets that leak because that is what living here means. \u201cWe close gates where we must and open them where we must and we tell them a better story, loud. Mavery will throw dirt at cameras. Jallo will lie to a minister about resource allocation and repent later when he finds a priest. Jana will tie knots that mean enough-sit-down. And we will look for the thief of circles.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to tie scumbles to stop boys from being idiots,\u201d Jana said, incredulous and delighted because it was neat. \u201cYou want me to ritualize the exit. You want a mark they can\u2019t perform without a teacher. You think making the pattern harder will make the dance less deadly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the city wants to be sung to in its right key,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cYou have one note. It is clear. I have one note. It is lower. Between us we can make a song that isn\u2019t catchy but is hard to kill.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if the other one\u2014 if somebody like me with worse manners\u2014 ties theirs,\u201d Jana said. \u201cIf they knot with stolen hair. If they declare their bridges while I build mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we go to their bridge and we untie it with salt and we speak into the pipe one sentence until it learns who its mother is,\u201d said Twyning, and it sounded like wisdom and luck had met in a stairwell and framed each other for each other\u2019s crimes. \u201cDo you know the sentence.\u201d\n\nJana did. Every city teaches a different version, but the bones are the same. It\u2019s the sentence a grandmother says when she walks past boys with bad tattoos and wants to bless them without being accused of condescension. It\u2019s the sentence that unhooks knives. It starts with the word \u201cnow\u201d because nothing else is as true and ends with \u201chome\u201d because nothing else ever will be. She didn\u2019t say it out loud. You don\u2019t speak that one to strangers.\n\nShe stood and the room adjusted its gravity around her without complaint. She looked at the sandwich ends and considered stealing the pickles back because nothing in this world will ever completely erase spite. She tucked her razor back so it lay as it should. She took the knot from Twyning\u2019s hand and held it in her palm until the warmth woke a little bit of its lazy wanting. \u201cThis isn\u2019t mine,\u201d she said, very softly. \u201cWhoever tied it wants me to think bigger or smaller than I am. That\u2019s either flattery or a trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreed left us a mirror,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cWe will look and then we will walk away.\u201d\n\nOn the way out, in the hallway that pretended to have been a library once, a kid from the Lower Blocks that the damp had made glamorous in the way hardship often does stood in front of Jana and Twyning with a face that refused to admit to trembling. He had chalk on his fingers. He held them up like a confession. \u201cI drew a toll in front of our house,\u201d he said, his voice both proud and terrified. \u201cSo people would be good on the stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it work,\u201d Jana asked, and she crouched, and the boy saw her eyebrows and didn\u2019t look away.\n\n\u201cMy little sister tripped and didn\u2019t fall,\u201d he said. \u201cShe grabbed the banister. I think that\u2019s like paying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is exactly like paying,\u201d said Twyning, and she gave him a coin, not for the toll, but for his story. \u201cYou keep the change. Don\u2019t spend it on grape things.\u201d\n\nThe van made the shape of a long breath on the street. The river adjusted to the gates. Somewhere, on a dock with its boards written over by the feet of men who think they are permanent, a knot that didn\u2019t belong did the small cruel work that copycats do: it hummed without knowing the tune, and the hum was catchy. Somewhere, in a room that had once been a dance studio, three boys rehearsed an apology they didn\u2019t intend to need. Somewhere, in the pool with its tiles much too patient, a woman sat on a mattress and wrapped purple cartridges in brown paper as if she were mailing candy to a school, and she wished she liked pickles so she could inherit the world as it was instead of the world as she wanted to collect it.\n\nThey drove toward the drains. They drove toward the bridges. They drove toward a sentence that begins in the mouth and ends under the tongue like a secret you keep there because it is your toll to pay, every day, across every span you dare.",

Dusk made a bruise out of the sky and pressed it to the river, and the river took it without complaint because being a river means being complicit in every weather. Twyning held the plastic throat of the intercom that spoke to the gates and said a sentence too low for the microphones and too plain for the poets; the gate-keeper on duty, Rell with the gray braid and knuckles like knots in a rope, answered out of the belly of the city with a cough and a yes that had more trust than protocol would have allowed. Jana watched Twyning talk to the water as if it were a nephew that might grow up decent if someone would only stop buying it fireworks. She liked that. She liked that the old woman said please to concrete and the concrete moved its shoulder just enough to show it had heard.\n\n\u201cYour voice sits where a hand would go if there was a shoulder,\u201d Jana said, leaning back until the van\u2019s ceiling touched her hair in an intimacy no architecture had earned. \u201cHow long did it take you to find that place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree wars and a choir practice,\u201d said Twyning. She considered her laugh and rejected it because the boy had died in a stairwell while men in neat jackets arranged sympathy into paragraphs. \u201cRell, close the ship gate by Mill Fire for six minutes. Do it like you\u2019re telling a lie and you\u2019ll get caught if you enjoy it.\u201d\n\nRell made a sound that could have been a prayer or a curse and the city shifted in the knee. The van took the hint and turned itself into an alley that had once been a path for cows and weddings and now delivered pizza and men with alarms tied to their belts. Jallo was on his communicator talking to a minister who had never met rain from below; he had swiveled his face into the shape men use when they are promising that consequences are a future species, not a present animal. Jana let his words wash through her. She had a ship to board in her head and it did not float on sentences like \u201coptics\u201d and \u201coutcome.\u201d\n\nThe third bridge wore its sugar of rust and then shrugged it off when the van\u2019s brakes kissed the curb. Children collected at the edges of caution tape the way bees gather at citrus peel; they knew something sweet was being articulated, even if they could not yet name it. Jana hopped down not like a prisoner and not like a hero, but with the vague disrespect of a person who has always expected stairs to be honest about their angles. She felt the air cool under the bridge the way breath cools on teeth and liked that too. Some days the city touched the parts of her that had been turned iron-hot by bad jobs and told them to sit down on the tile and drink water.\n\nHer knot under the third was where she\u2019d left it, which is not a sentence you can often say in a place where drunk men correct graffiti with philosophy and bored girls untie ribbons because they can. She took it in her hand and felt in her palm the history of three clean shaves gone precise as arithmetic. She had tied those hairs tighter than hunger because she respected anything that might be asked to hold. The knot hummed like a throat with a cough that had decided to be a hymn instead. She glanced to see if Twyning had heard it. Of course she had. The sergeant\u2019s hearing was not ears so much as a map of old wounds that told her how the weather would travel through them.\n\n\u201cShow me,\u201d said Twyning, and that was the whole trick of her. She didn\u2019t say teach me so she could repeat it later with more authority. She said show me because she liked being the second pair of hands on a job.\n\nJana crouched and licked salt from her wrist where the city had left it like a kiss. She drew with a stub of chalk on the wet brick, not circles because circles are doors for stories to wander in, but figure-eights that crossed at the place every grandmother keeps her spare key. She tied a new scumble with two fresh hairs she had pulled that morning and one from the sergeant\u2019s coat where it had caught and made plans. She tucked the knot where water whispered old tax law and she spoke a sentence that had no poetry in it whatsoever and therefore worked. The sentence did what sentences once did in kitchens when a mother told a child to sit with their feet flat on the floor and a glass of milk ready to be drunk. It was not magic. It was manners tied to memory. The current softened one half-note and somebody above them laughed and then stopped because suddenly you could hear yourself breathing and it seemed rude.\n\nChildren stared like she had taken something out of a hat and it had learned their names. Jana did not look at them because looking at children makes them put on a show, and shows are a terrible diet for small souls. She looked at Twyning instead and saw the recognition pass across the woman\u2019s face like a weather front, gentle and thorough. \u201cNow,\u201d said Jana under her breath, placing the knot as if it were a plate at a thrift-store wedding. \u201cNow go home,\u201d said Twyning, not as instruction to people, but to water that had forgotten where it slept.\n\nThey worked the underside of three bridges in an hour because haste knew when to make itself useful. At each, the chalk made the figure-eights and the knot was speaking with hair instead of plastic, and the sentence\u2014the right kind\u2014pressed its small authoritative palm to the pipe\u2019s forehead and checked for fever. Mavery\u2019s dirty magic made cameras pick up only the sound of their own fans, and a man with a drone discovered that his drone had suddenly remembered that it was a toy, not a god. Jallo stood by the tape and told parents that standing at a railing and watching old women talk to mortar builds better bone than a year of supplements, and a mother believed him enough to put her cigarettes in her pocket and stop narrating disaster in a voice that taught her children to sing it later.\n\nBy the time they turned their attention to the docks, the light had fallen into that hour that makes even a bad man want to build a small clean thing with his hands. The boardwalk complained under their steps like an old aunt who expected people to respect her linoleum. Tar and brine and a sweetness like a factory had married and had offspring that clung to the sinuses with stubborn delight. Mavery met them out of a crooked office that sold permits to tie hopes to pilings. She had purple on her fingers and grin creases that made a better shirt than most shirts.\n\n\u201cThree counterfeit scumbles in a line and one up a ladder where only a fool or a saint would bother,\u201d she said, tucking herself between Jana and Twyning as if triangulation were her birthright. \u201cThe hum is wrong. It\u2019s dirty-sweet, like fruit that has been told a joke and won\u2019t stop laughing at itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow us,\u201d said Twyning. She had taken her hands out of her pockets and was letting the attention flow across her like a cloak. She knew better than to take off her authority in public, but she knew how to fold it thin. Mavery led them to a stanchion where an old metal ring still believed it would be useful to a rope, and there in the grime was a knot that had stolen hair off a brush and tied it into a loop that did not understand why it was a loop at all. Zip ties held it in a faithless hug. Jana felt a temper in her blood that had always pretended to be a different thing rise up and look for a hammer.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to own what they did not pay for,\u201d she said, not to the women but to the waterfaced thing that waits for human voices under planks. \u201cThey are trying to make the river say their names back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to sell a password,\u201d Mavery said, popping her gum like a charm. \u201cAnd you cannot sell one that keeps a door shut. You can only sell one that opens it.\u201d\n\nTwyning took the counterfeit scumble up with gloved fingers as if lifting a half-dead bird off a schoolyard. She put it on her palm and looked at Jana because asking is a habit that keeps people alive. Jana shook salt into the knot from a paper twist Mavery had conjured, and then she said the sentence again, the one with the now and the home, and when she reached the middle, Twyning folded her note into it, lower and capable of turning a crowd away from a burning building without making them feel they had lost. The zip ties shuddered. One snapped like a gamine\u2019s cheap bracelet. The water under the boards stopped trying to brag.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll tie more,\u201d Jana said, but her shoulders came down because we are built to appreciate even unknowable victories. \u201cThey\u2019ll tie them where we cannot smell them for a day or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we set bait,\u201d said Mavery. She did not mean to be cruel; she was merely ambitious about making the world choose her stalls instead of anyone else\u2019s. \u201cWe let one sit somewhere a camera wants to go and then we watch for who comes to preen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou enjoy working for both sides until you can fold them into one,\u201d said Twyning, and it would have sounded like condemnation if there had not been admiration in it. \u201cBe careful. Some men build only to pull things apart with their hands later when someone else is watching.\u201d\n\nMavery\u2019s mouth made a shape like sewing. \u201cThe men you worry about spelled their names on the underside of a bridge last night so the city would have to say them when it coughs. I am going to unteach the pipes their names. Go find me a villain I can invoice.\u201d\n\nJallo made a noise at their backs that meant Command had learned to type the word \u201cnarrative\u201d into a memo and believed technology had saved them from needing to know how stories function. He waved a hand like a drowned man signaling to a boat and then pretended he had only been stretching. \u201cThey are getting a sponsor for their press conference about decency,\u201d he said, and his face said he was embarrassed to belong to the species. \u201cThey want Jana to stand behind them with her eyebrows meaningful. They want Sergeant to say the word partnership.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them to print those words on paper and attach them to kites,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cThere is wind enough for everyone today.\u201d She looked out at the water and the water looked back with a face that refused to be photogenic. \u201cWe have work that cannot be panel-discussed.\u201d\n\nThey heard the voice before they saw the man, which is how it goes with certain kinds of danger. He came out of a warehouse door that had been painted an emphatic blue and had then learned humility under rain and porters\u2019 hands. He wore a jacket that made the word tactical into a catalogue, and his beard had been arranged an hour ago into an argument about masculinity. He smiled with his mouth and did numbers with his eyes. He had that look of a person who stands three feet from a mirror every morning and negotiates, successfully, with his reflection. Two boys behind him carried a bag that whispered the sound plastic makes when it believes it contains consent.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the artisan,\u201d he said to Jana, and managed to make artisan sound like something you wipe off a shoe. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who understood virality as if it were a river. We could have made a lot together if you had answered my message instead of acting like a fable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t answer men who ask me to monetise my grandmother,\u201d Jana said, and her voice located the place in the boards where they would break if everyone ran at once. \u201cYou tied a knot with stolen hair and told a pipe that it was a celebrity. The pipe laughed until it broke a boy.\u201d\n\nHe winced and then made it look like a smile because he had not been taught how to deal with a verb like broke when it applied to someone not him. \u201cCollateral tragedies are the tax that the new city pays to get old city out of its way,\u201d he said, and it was almost clever enough to live. \u201cI am not your enemy. I am brand safety with knees. I am the person who can make your tolls turn into dividends for you and a public-health initiative for the municipality. I know men in rooms. They are almost as tired as you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you hear yourself,\u201d Mavery asked, delighted and almost ashamed of her delight. \u201cYou talk like a man trying to sell aspirin to a river.\u201d\n\nTwyning stepped forward in such a manner that men in rooms would have gotten out of the way without later recognizing that they had been moved. \u201cSee,\u201d she said, softly enough that he had to step closer to be insulted. \u201cYou have inverted the grammar. You think first-person is a tide, and that you are its moon. You are, in fact, a barge with a loudhailer. Take your boys and their bag and go back to the place where men explain things to other men. We are removing your knots with the correct salt. We are teaching the river its house number.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have that authority,\u201d he said, and felt foolish while he said it because some authority advertisements you recognize too late. \u201cYou\u2019re a civil servant. You own a whistle, not a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cI own a sandwich and the memory of drowning and a city that answers when I call it by its birth name,\u201d said Twyning, and the boys behind him set the bag down like obedience had been a marble someone tossed to them and it had rolled into their palms. \u201cWhich is more authority than you will ever buy.\u201d\n\nHe tried to pivot because pivoting had saved him in rooms and alleys and marriages. He turned toward Jana and made an offer with his mouth that was probably a list of numbers leaned against a single word: freedom. She lifted the splurge and pointed it at his voice and smiled until he could not tell whether it was a kindness or her teeth. \u201cYou are the new kind of toll,\u201d she said, without moving the barrel enough to make anyone flinch. \u201cThe one greed invented when bridges started crying. The kind that thinks everything can be wrapped in language and therefore owned. You smell like sugar and metal and a mother who told you you\u2019d be a king if you smiled while you were cruel. Leave the docks. Leave the drains. Tie your knots in your own hair if you must tie something.\u201d\n\nThe boys behind him did the arithmetic that boys do when the ground refuses to be impressed by the pressure of their shoes. One put his hand in the bag and pulled out a splurge that had been manufactured like a rumor, and he held it like a toy he\u2019d been told was a god. Twyning didn\u2019t move faster than them. She did not need to. She said the sentence to the wooden ribs beneath them and the dock remembered that it knows how to creak at exactly the right time. The boy stumbled and the gun he was trying to make into a man fell against Jana\u2019s foot with all the resistance of a dog that has learned it will be fed even if it stops growling. Jana stepped on it lightly, not to break it but to remind it of its ancestry. Mavery had a hand at the boy\u2019s elbow and the kind of smile that made men tell the truth to save time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put you on a scooter and make you take your breakfast to your mother,\u201d Mavery said to him, calm as a judge with a cup of tea. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a mother, borrow one from a neighbor and bring the cup back. Don\u2019t buy grapes on the way.\u201d\n\nThe man with the beard had gone pale in points, like someone had erased him with a kneaded eraser. He looked at his boys and saw that they were already leaking their future back into the cracks of the dock. He made a noise like a plan and substituted it with a shrug like a curse. \u201cThis city will eat you,\u201d he said to Jana because prophecy is what men say when they want to sound like gravity. \u201cIt eats girls who think they own its stories.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a girl,\u201d she said, pleasantly. \u201cI am a troll. The city knows what to do with me. It is confused about you.\u201d\n\nHe left by a door that had always been there in buildings where men need exits to the street and to their cars and to their excuses. Twyning watched him go, not because she liked to watch enemies\u2019 backs but because she had a list of where to write to make sure he did not get to talk about narrative hygiene in any room where chairs had wheels. Jallo made notes like little oars. The water underfoot made a contented shape with its mouth.\n\nBy the time they had untied six counterfeit scumbles in a line that made too much sense and therefore had never been a river plan, Command had discovered a way to use the phrase \u201ccommunity partnership\u201d in a sentence without choking on the community or the partnership. They wanted to hold a demonstration of safety under Angel\u2019s Crossback at full noon and make people stand in squares and say the sentence into the air. They wanted a blessed angle and a sponsor that sold razors to men who feared age like a dog fears thunder. Mavery snorted until her gum surrendered its last grace. \u201cWe will do our demonstration now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will do it in a way that the algorithm cannot sell. We will do it with soup.\u201d\n\nThey did it with soup because soup is the content that refuses to be content. Twyning called three caretakers whose faces had learned to be multitudes and told them to bring vats. Mavery told a woman who made candles that smelled like safety to bring wicks that wouldn\u2019t burn in wind, which is to say she told her to bring nothing but a smile, and the woman came because women who make candles know that sometimes the wax is invisible. Jana stood under the third bridge and shaved a length of rope instead of a man, and the hair of the rope fell in curls that looked like laughter and children picked them up and made moustaches and no one died of ambition. Twyning said the sentence, once, twice, three times, and the third time the water made a sound like a person who has turned a pillow to the cool side and returned to a dream they can manage. Mothers dipped bread. Boys put down their phones long enough to burn their mouths. The grape smell lost a fight with onion and pepper and a bone that had given everything it owned without an invoice.\n\nIt didn\u2019t trend. It couldn\u2019t. It tasted good and it made an argument for bedtimes. The algorithm licked it once and put it away because it was like a grandmother, not a dance. Jana watched that failure with a happiness that embarrassed her a little because she had come to rely on that other species of success, the one that makes men in buttoned shirts say her name as if they had invented it. Twyning watched it with the calm of someone who has seen a crowd saved by boredom and knows what a miracle that is. Jallo ate two bowls and told the truth to his supervisor and did not get fired because a child on the rail had posted a clip of him wiping soup off his tie in a way that made the comments kinder for a full fifteen minutes.\n\nAfter soup, the grief that had been sitting on the curb like a dog with ribs came and sat under the rail, because grief knows where the food is. The mother from the stairwell came with a picture, and the picture had the kind of edges that small prints from old kiosks used to have, and she could not speak the word justice without making it sound like a street name. Jana did not know how to talk to mothers. She knew how to take men\u2019s money. She knew how to shave a soft jaw until it was eager to listen. She knew how to sleep under a pool that had been emptied of water and not dream of drowning. She stood a step away and let Twyning be the one who held the mother\u2019s elbow and took her coin because paying the toll is what keeps bridges from collapsing. They did not fix anything. They moved the next minute away from the drop.\n\nThey went back under to look for the other impossible knot\u2014the one that had done its work by the dock and claimed a name\u2014and found only the mark of it, a little burn in the brick like someone had held a lit cigarette to the city and asked it to admit to being alive. Jana ran her finger over it and felt the past sit up and cough. \u201cContractors,\u201d she said, almost surprised to hear the word and then not at all because she had been smelling their solvent in alleyways for a year. \u201cThe ones who wash old stories off new buildings. The ones who work for the ones who hate rust and love steel. This is their brand of wrong. They want gentlemen to feel safe in trousers that cost more than ducks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think they are tying circles to make a new sidewalk religion,\u201d Mavery said, and she loved the idea like a jeweler loves a flaw that gives a stone character and tells a story at a party. \u201cYou think they want to manage fear the way you manage breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they want to own the price of crossing,\u201d Jana said, and she spat into the drain because some gestures still count as punctuation when the city reads them. \u201cThey saw me making a living and they drew a business plan. They put hair on an invoice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always do,\u201d said Twyning. She was tired in that way that means the job is exactly where it ought to be. \u201cThey will put a charm on a crane and call it heritage. They will call me to cut a ribbon while they lay more cement where the river needs a mouth. We will find their yard. We will find their man with the beard and we will find his boss who knows how to sit very still when his name is said.\u201d\n\nJallo had already found the yard because he was an uncomplicated miracle when asked to follow trucks that pretended to be anonymous. He had a map traced in his notebook in a hand so neat a nun would have kissed it, and he pointed with his pencil because pointing with a finger causes temper. \u201cOut by the salt stacks,\u201d he said. \u201cBehind the place that used to sell pigeons, which now sells storage for people who will never be at home long enough to unpack. They have a security guard who reads novels and a camera that thinks fog is a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Twyning. She tucked the knot she had taken earlier back into the pocket where the little prayer lived, and the two things quarrelled pleasantly against her hip. \u201cWe will go in as caretakers bringing a complaint about drains because men in suits cannot resist telling caretakers about drainage. We will carry clipboards and our finest bored faces. Jana, you will be invisible because you do not own a clipboard and because men cannot see women they have not paid to insult them. Mavery, you will be in the ceiling, as usual. Jallo, you will make friends with the man who reads novels and find out whether he likes soup.\u201d\n\nThey went not like a raid, which would have made everyone on site gather their words into weapons, but like women going to correct a bill. The storage yard had the posture of a place that knows it is temporarily important and permanently vulnerable. The salt stacks made white hills like snow had been convinced to hold still for a portrait. A crane made its slow wet cross in the distance and the sky leaned close to hear if it would sing. The guard at the gate had a book whose cover had been loved to transparency. He saw the clipboards and his shoulders went down because clipboards are the form of weather that tells you your roof is not about to blow away.\n\n\u201cAfternoon,\u201d said Twyning, and her smile made him younger because grown women condescend less than radios. \u201cWe came about the drains at Angel\u2019s Crossback and signage about industrial water. I can give you only one of those today; the other is a meal we will cook together when you can explain to me who on your team likes to make friends with pipes using hair and lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this a survey,\u201d he asked, because sometimes men need a category before they can let their mouths be useful.\n\n\u201cIt is a conversation that ends better if you help it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name so I don\u2019t have to call you \u2018officer\u2019 and make you feel like you\u2019re captured.\u201d\n\n\u201cLen,\u201d he said, honest by accident. \u201cI don\u2019t like pickles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are solving a citywide pickle,\u201d said Jana, and she didn\u2019t mean to speak but the sentence borrowed her as a ventriloquist does a wooden friend. \u201cWe have soup. Somebody used your yard as a loading dock for counterfeit stories. They tied bad knots under our bridges and made the pipes sing the wrong tune. We came to ask whom you rent your reasons from.\u201d\n\nLen looked at Jana and, for a second, saw her because she had said his preference aloud without knowing it, and a heart that has been met on its own trivial hill cannot deny that a meeting has occurred. He scratched his eyebrow as if he\u2019d like to have someone shave it off so he could start over. \u201cYou talk like my aunt,\u201d he said to Twyning, and it was not an accusation. \u201cThe manager is in the hangar with the skylights that leak. He doesn\u2019t like weather unless it is in a forecast on a big screen. You can talk at him until he lets you sit down.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d said Twyning. \u201cWe are weather. Lead us to his leak.\u201d\n\nThey crossed a yard where pallets made rectangles like Lego cities built by a child who had absorbed the logic of urban planning by smelling it. Mavery\u2019s shadow slid over them once, twice, a gull behaving more intelligently than gulls ought, and then it was gone because she\u2019d found the break in the fence that let a woman become a rumor. Inside the hangar, the air tasted of solvents and ambition. Men in shirts that wanted to be made of money moved rolled-up blueprints back and forth like they were setting a table for a ghost banquet. The manager had a tie that pretended to be a harness. He smiled when he saw Twyning the way a man smiles when he has decided a woman is going to explain to him how he can have what he wants without paying.\n\n\u201cWe are in compliance,\u201d he said, before she had identified herself in any manner. \u201cIf you are here about runoff, we have forms. If you are here about hair, you will need to be more explicit, because my team does not run a salon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour team runs stories through drains,\u201d said Twyning, and once you had heard her say that you would have forgiven any sin to get her to teach you how to do it. \u201cUnder Angel\u2019s Crossback, a knot with stolen hair was tied with zip ties that your supplier buys in lots of five thousand and signs for with the name of a man who pretends not to read novels. Under the docks, a knot hummed in a key that is not the river\u2019s. In the Lower Blocks, a child fell because a boy who watched your video thought he could become a bridge by bullying his friend. I want the name of the department in your company that handles superstition. We will be shutting it down by tea.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because sometimes men laugh when the part of their body that believes in sovereign immunity realizes there is a court that does not recognize its flag. \u201cThere\u2019s no such department,\u201d he said, and then added, with the tiny cunning that has gotten him a window, \u201cbut if there were, we would be shuttering it ourselves in the name of brand stewardship.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour brand is a kind of mildew,\u201d Mavery said from somewhere that made three men look up and see only glass. \u201cIt comes in after the flood and leaves its ghost on curtains forever.\u201d\n\nJana drifted around the edges of the hangar like an old song people think they have forgotten, and looked for knots tied where men never glance. She found the altar in the corner, which was a joke for men and a thing for the city: three zip ties, a coil of cheap chain, a nail bent into a hook, and a printed flier for an event that promised to explain the undercity to investors in two hours with cocktails. The hair twisted into a loop had been cut, not shed, and that mattered in a way that made her teeth press themselves together to keep in a prayer. She scooped the mess into a plastic bin marked FLOOR MATS and carried it to Twyning, who lifted a brow like a weapons test.\n\nThe manager looked at the bin and performed innocence. He had done it in rooms where the carpet was thick as the promises, and it had made his salary clap its hands. Here on concrete, it made no sound at all. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d he said, and he did not make his mouth smaller before he lied, which is how you can tell which men have been allowed to practice their lies too long without kindly correction. \u201cThat could be from any one of a dozen subcontractors who consider tradition part of their going-to-market strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cTradition is something you are allowed to speak about when your shoes have learned to read the names on stairs,\u201d said Twyning. She did not lift her voice. It lifted itself. \u201cYou will give me the names of twelve, and I will make soup for the ones who tell me the truth first. The others can eat grape.\u201d\n\nA forklift beeped in a corner like a child with a new recorder. Men shuffled paper until it made them feel serious. Jallo handed the manager a pen that he had washed in a sink so often it had become gentle. The pen made neat black marks that said, in different spellings and with varying degrees of reluctance, a set of names that behaved like a family. Jana recognized two from contracts that had glanced the yards where she bought cartridges and carefully forgot her face. She put a finger on one, the one that pretended to be a charity at weekends, and she looked at Twyning and nodded because sometimes women perform telepathy at a professional level.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Twyning, and if he had been a better man he would have heard the absolution in the sound. \u201cWe will go now and teach a few men not to speak to pipes without permission. If you tie one more thing under my bridges, I will put you on a poster with hearts around your face. They\u2019ll call you the Pretty of Angel\u2019s Crossback and your mother will deny you three times before dinner.\u201d\n\nWhen they stepped back into the yard, the light had gone into that uncompromising clarity that cities sometimes give as a treat to people who have not lied to themselves for a few hours. The salt stacks shone like people who can afford to forgive. Len held out a thermos as if he were daring them to refuse gratitude. \u201cIt\u2019s soup,\u201d he said, unnecessarily. \u201cIt\u2019s not as good as the soup you make, but it\u2019s the kind my aunt taught me when I thought I could drink sugar for dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will drink it and tell her you are famous in the Lower Blocks for reading novels,\u201d said Twyning. Jana took a swallow and let the hot fat coat her throat as if it were a small, edible armor. She remembered being small on a floor counting coins with edges that would bite if you didn\u2019t respect them. She remembered not liking pickles and not being brave enough to say it aloud.\n\nThey were almost to the van when the air went wrong. You learn it if you live where weather and men compete for the right to make days sudden. The crowd noise under Angel\u2019s Crossback folded onto itself like a paper boat when a child pokes the bottom. Someone ran in a direction you do not run unless you are moving away from a thing with teeth. Mavery was gone by the time Jana turned to look because she was a professional, and professionals do not say, \u201coh,\u201d when the work appears; they vanish into it.\n\nIt was a knot in the wrong place that did it, tied clever where a camera had just enough angle and a child had just enough curiosity. It had made the pipe sing in the thin register that turns laughter into screaming, and a boy\u2019s hand had gone to his throat because human hands are eager to learn that gesture now. Jana ran. Twyning ran different, conserving strength because experience has shown her how long a sprint will be when the city decides to set an exam. They reached the mouth of the drain to find the scuffle that is not violence yet but wants very much to be promoted. A man with a phone had his arms out as if he could hold back consequence with two forearms and some moral fiber he\u2019d found in a TED talk. A girl had climbed onto a rail and was shouting the sentence wrong because she had only heard it secondhand, and the pipe did not recognize a badly hummed lullaby.\n\nJana did the thing with the breath. She put her mouth over her own panic and held it like an egg, then cracked it into the room and let the smell of onions and salt and steel and soap and old bread that lives in cupboards live there instead. She stepped into the center, which is not a place you ought to stand unless you are clear about who you are. She cupped the counterfeit scumble with both hands because sometimes puppets only stop performing when someone bigger picks them up. She said the sentence the right way, with the now in her left palm and the home in her right, and she did not say it to people. She said it to a pipe that had been made to feel like it was trending. Beside her, not touching but close enough to lend gravity, Twyning said the second note, the one only women who have packed sandbags in dresses and boots know how to hit. The hum dropped. The crowd\u2019s shoulders dropped. The girl came down off the rail like a bird who has remembered that flying isn\u2019t an argument, it\u2019s a private art.\n\nSomeone cried because the body needs a signal to say, \u201cwe will not die this minute.\u201d Someone else clapped because relief is an actor that does old bits in the wrong places. The knot in Jana\u2019s hands went slack and then crumbled because Mavery had found, days ago, a powder in a drawer that makes plastic forget it once thought it could be permanent. The camera caught nothing useful and then a great deal of soup, which the algorithm pushed dutifully at noon tomorrow under the tag COMFORT, and men turned the volume down and watched it without telling anyone that their throats had tightened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a child\u2019s hour now,\u201d said Twyning, when the immediate need had been taught to sit. \u201cChildren should be put to bed in rooms where something smells like a pot that remembers being warm. Let\u2019s go steal a flier and nail it to the door of the charity that launders fear. Mavery, throw dirt. Jallo, sharpen your pen. Jana, tie me three knots that say not here with a tooth in each.\u201d\n\nThey did not get to sleep. They rode the city like the horses that know which way the soldiers are going before the captain has made the map. They tied scumbles and untied lies. They turned gates precisely and they opened them wide when a woman with pink slippers needed to hear a river speak softly under her window because her house had been quiet too long. At dawn, a gull lit on the rail at Angel\u2019s Crossback and preened as if it had invented the word ritual. At dawn, a minister went on television and got one sentence almost right and another entirely wrong, and the wrong one got quoted because it had a joke in it about trolls that made a man in a studio laugh in a way that made children say he looked like their father.\n\nAt dawn, in the locker-room pool, the battery heater failed and Jana\u2019s hands went cold in the way that tells you what kind of person you are before breakfast. She pulled a blanket around herself that had once been a field flag at a parade and thought about the price of bridges and of shaving a man who had a dog on his shoulder and thought that perhaps she had taken on an unpaid internship as an older technology than she had intended. The razor lay beside her like a friend too well-behaved to wake her for gossip, and she let her eyes close because even trolls have to sleep if they intend to tie a city together tight enough that boys with sugar-water guns cannot loosen it by pointing them badly at throats.\n\nShe dreamed of a single hair bent into an impossible knot that someone kept tugging with greedy fingers until it screamed. She dreamed of a sentence that started with now and ended with home and the word in the middle changed each time, sometimes war and sometimes bread and sometimes children and sometimes tax. She dreamed of Twyning\u2019s voice saying it in a church with no walls and a ceiling made of river, and of Mavery selling admission at the door for the price of admitting you had once been frightened. She dreamed of a boy with a bricked phone putting it down and picking up a piece of chalk and drawing a figure-eight on his step so his sister would not fall.\n\nWhen she woke her hand was already reaching for the cartridges she had promised herself she would change. Mavery had been right. The grape had become a joke boys were dying for. She took the vials with their ridiculous cheerfulness and tipped them into a jar with salt and dish soap and hot water and watched the color sink like a show-off swallowing his tongue. She wrote a note and taped it to the wall with surgical tape that had once held a wound closed. The note said: Purple is retired. Bring me a shade that makes boys admit to crying and keeps them home long enough to stop laughing. Mavery would understand. Mavery understood more than was good for anyone in this city who planned to be alive two years from Tuesday.\n\nBy midmorning, the charity had been named aloud by a woman with a spoon, and the manager with the tie that thought it was a harness had given a quote about partnerships that the news cut just before he said the word stewardship. Twyning had a meeting on a bench with a grandmother who wore a coat like a ship and told her that it would be all right to put a chalk line on the stoop and ask men to pay by putting their phones in their pockets. Jallo took a call from a boy who wanted to confess to not being brave on a stairwell and told him he would be given the job of not being brave again tomorrow and the next day and the rest of the year until the habit took. The river tasted like metal and soup and coins and a sweetness that might once have been grapes and was now turning into something else, something like patience.\n\nNear noon, a message slid under the door of the caretaker\u2019s room with the precision of a cat\u2019s paw. It was a single hair, blade-steel, tied in a knot that neither belonged to Jana nor had been tied by a fool. It sat on an envelope with no return address. Inside, there was a sentence written in ink the color of sidewalks after rain. The sentence did not threaten and it did not brag. It said: Now we will see if your home is bigger than mine. It said it without capital letters, as if it had decided religion could be discussed only in lowercase.\n\nTwyning read it first and folded it back into the envelope and put the envelope in her pocket next to the little prayer and the scumble that had not yet decided who it belonged to. She looked at Jana and did not smile because smiles weigh a lot when you make them do so much. \u201cWe have our thief of circles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have our next bridge. Eat your soup. Bring your razor. Wear your tired like a ribbon. We are going to ask the city to love us enough to be inconvenient in all the right places.\u201d\n\nJana finished the last of the soup because you cannot bargain with hunger and win unless you sit at the same table. She put her hand on the van as it coughed into willingness and felt, through its metal, the hum of the undercity listening, curious and bored and mean and kind the way children are. She set her splurge down beside her. She set her razor against her wrist. She thought about tolls, and taxes, and the way a good story steals the shame out of your mouth and replaces it with a sentence that fits a bridge as perfectly as hair fits a scumble. Then they went, not because a minister had made a speech, but because the river had asked in its old quiet voice and neither of them knew how to say anything but yes to it when it remembered their names.",

                              "content": "They took the van along streets that had learned the grammar of sirens and sleeping dogs, the envelope with its lowercase dare folded beside Twyning\u2019s prayer as if paper could argue with paper and come to a truce. Jana read the sentence again because repetition is a kind of scent you lay down in front of yourself so you can find your way back if the city forgets you, and she said, without meaning to give the thought air, that the person who had written it understood the difference between address and threat. Twyning agreed without opening her mouth, which was something Jana had started to notice and not fear; it felt like standing in a kitchen where somebody who had worked out a recipe with stubborn patience watched you try your hand at it and did not correct you until you reached for the salt with the wrong fingers. Jallo drove as if he were ferrying a sleeping child and a fuse in the same blanket, and he made notes out loud to keep himself honest; he listed the bridges that were awake, the drains that were dreaming badly, the names they had collected on their clipboard like birds that might come when called to soup.\n\nMavery met them two turns shy of the river\u2019s oldest brick with a bag she had stitched from billboard vinyl that had once pretended to sell clean skies. She brought cartridges the color of smoked glass and said, with relish held in a little bowl of restraint, that she had bottled the scent of rain after a first lightning and taught it to live politely inside a bullet. Jana held one up to the light and saw the amber not as a trinket but as a recipe written in solvent and luck, and her shoulders loosened because this was not an invitation to a joke; it was a request that boys who wanted to be brave in kitchens would have to think before they imitated it. Twyning took two and put them in her coat like a woman sliding notes from a choir director into the lining for later use, and she told Mavery she had been generous in a way that would cost her customers, which is another way of saying brave when you don\u2019t want to flatter a friend so hard she falls over.\n\nThe knot on the envelope had not been Jana\u2019s and not the amateur\u2019s, and the more she rolled it in her hand the more she felt the grammar of someone who had been taught rituals from a different anthology than hers. It had been tied with patience and the small malice of neatness, the way a person stacks coins to make sound go quiet, and she did not know yet whether the hair it held would sing when you called it by its river name. Twyning said the word museum in the middle of a sentence about drains and made the van believe that their next stop would not be a bridge, and Jana smiled because she understood; you go to where people keep their versions of home catalogued and under lights when you want to find the man who thinks his home is larger than everyone else\u2019s because he has insured it. The museum in the Iron Ward had been a train shed and then a warehouse and then an empty rumor and now it held models of the city carved from wood and poured in resin and printed from plans until the entire undercity had been turned into a toy that boys in suits could move with one finger and feel godlike about without getting their hands river-wet.\n\nThey walked in with clipboards and exhaustion that read as authority, and the guard at the door took one look at Twyning and decided to trust his morning instead of his training. The model of Angel\u2019s Crossback was larger than a table and smaller than a pride, its rivets picked out in solder, its drains represented by polished tubes you could see through if your eyes knew how to look at glass and not see yourself first. A man stood with a pointer and a certainty and told three people who wanted to be ready for the floodgates how safety could be a brand if you made it less boring, and Jana thought he spoke like the letter that had slipped under their door: lowercase and clean and designed to be repeated until it sounded like prayer. He did not have the tactical beard; he had the jaw of a boy the city had forgiven for too much too early, and his hands were the good kind of soft, the sort that have known paper and chalk and the weight of a name in a ledger.\n\nTwyning joined the group as if she had been there all along and asked a question about the pitch of a pipe in a tone that made the pointer slow down and check whether he had mispronounced volume. He smiled with relief because he had been waiting for an adult to arrive and make the room behave, and he told her that the plan for managing folklore had been assigned to his team because you cannot leave myth to police or to profit alone, and the word assigned carried so much priest and so much accountant that Jana almost laughed before she remembered the stairwell and the boy with the wrong kind of blue on his fingers. The pointer called himself Curator of Underspeech and had a card printed on recycled something that would never rot, and he disapproved of the term troll because it distracted from outcomes, which were measurable and therefore useful. Jana did not give him her name because she had learned that there are people you shouldn\u2019t let pronounce you until they have earned the right not to grind you between their teeth in front of an audience.\n\nHe had tied knots, she could smell it even with the resin and the varnish pretending to be air, and he had meant them to be helpful, which made her heart and her mouth argue over who should be in charge of insults. He talked about community gateways and participatory tolling in a way that made the skin on the back of Twyning\u2019s hands get ready to go cold, and he said softly that the city needed something to stitch it in places where stitches had been forbidden by budgets, and that men like him could be the needle if only the thread would come without knots. Mavery made a sound in the back of her throat that meant she could sell him his own shoes and have him thank her for the way she tied the laces, and she drifted away up into the rafters to find the camera that was definitely watching this exhibition of reason.\n\nThey did not arrest him. They did not cut his card in half and press the pieces into his palm until the letters imprinted themselves onto his life line. They let him show them his plan, which was an imitation of a ritual drawn by someone who loved diagrams more than bridges, and they humored his pilfered sentence, which started with when instead of now and ended with harbor instead of home because he had never had to think about what it meant to live in a block that kept its doors open for air. Twyning told him, while looking at the model of a pipe, that if he tied one more community gateway without the permission of a woman who knew how to make soup and a man who could accept pickles being taken off his lunch, she would have to take it personally, and he blinked twice because he had just learned how large a person can be without making any noise.\n\nAfter that courtesy they went hunting, not for him but for the knot he had promised in lowercase, and the scent of it took them uphill, away from the river\u2019s brag, into the district where buildings remembered being mills and held the smell of flour in their wood the way hands remember smoke years after the fire has moved on. The sentence on the envelope had started a measure, and they followed it to a place called the Spindle, where threads used to be given to machines and turned into wages and then into funerals; now it was a mixed-use temple where yoga pretended to be forgiveness and forgiveness pretended to be a drink you could buy with oat milk. The knot had been tied inside the atrium, under a skylight that a contractor had convinced to stop leaking by promising it a plaque with his name on it, and it was hung from the ribs of the building like a charm meant to prevent lawsuits. It was beautiful because it had been made by a hand that instinctively turned function into show, and it was deadly because it had stolen hair from a hundred brushes and did not know what those heads had prayed for when they cut it.\n\nJana stood under it and felt every mistake she had ever made assemble itself for a roll call, and she resisted the urge to slice the thing free with one flick and call it over, because she had begun to understand that the city never lets you finish something satisfying when a crowd is nearby. Twyning took in the room as if she were a tailor measuring guilt for a suit, and she pointed at the corners where the voices would become ugly if someone said the wrong word. Mavery had already ghosted up the metalwork and tapped the knot with a fingernail, and the hum that came back was exquisite and stupid and full of self-regard. Jallo went and stood by the entrance and started talking about a maintenance issue because a maintenance issue is the spell that keeps people from coming into a room with their phones open when they should not come into a room at all.\n\nThere was no grape to cut through; the smell here was new, a varnished hope that men buy because it looks good on a mantlepiece, and Jana knew that the only way to unmake this one was to pay more dearly than she liked. She took a strand of her own hair, not the surface kind that falls when you pull a sweater over your head, but one rescued from the point above the ear where tenderness lives, and she laid it on the floor with the carefulness she brought to money that could not be got again. She took from inside her shirt the thread she had wound months ago from the eyebrow hairs of the first three men she had shaved until their faces thought they were statutes and their minds learned to be quiet for a hour; that thread had seen bridges and soup and the back of a van, and it had been her passport, and she tied it into the knot at the Spindle with her own, making a scumble inside the counterfeit that would not let the big neat loop do its showy harm. The hair sang when she touched it with warm fingers, and the sound went down the ribs of the building and into the bones of its oldest beams and made them remember the voices of women who had once worked here and made this place run and ran while men owned them on paper and in law and in beds that had been bought with their fingers.\n\nTwyning stood below and said the sentence like a woman saying grace over steam, and she let the middle word be bread because bread had been a god here, and the end be home because even mills need to go somewhere to sleep. The knot trembled like a rich person being told no and then sagged because Mavery, predictable as a sun in her mischief, had emptied a pouch of ground salt into the exact seam of the exact beam that would carry the weight where it would learn manners. The crowd in the lobby, arrested by the news of a maintenance issue, did that slow turn away you get when boredom wins its small victory over spectacle, and Jana felt the floor the way a woman feels a baby roll inside her and realized the city would tolerate their correction today if they stopped making it look like a performance.\n\nThey finished the untying with hands that had performed grief the hour before and would need to perform soup soon, and then the lesser sound began\u2014the squawk of drones that had been sent to film a different triumph and had decided to take a detour. Mavery swore with elegance and snapped a little chrysalis of wire and resin from her pocket that coughed radio boredom into the air, and the drones lost interest and went to stare at a puddle where a sunbeam was doing what sunbeams do best. Twyning nodded to Len\u2019s cousin, who had plainly taken a job at the Spindle because his aunt had told him grown men should have coats even in August, and the cousin nodded back because sometimes cities are nothing but families pretending to be bureaucracies to keep the furniture from turning into weapons.\n\nThey took their leave before gratitude made the building\u2019s manager come and give a speech, and on the way down the stairs Jana said, without pride and without apology, that she had tied her hair to a counterfeit because sometimes you have to invest yourself in an enemy to persuade it to stop howling. Twyning replied that she had eaten stranger sacrifices in other uniforms and found them good for the digestion if taken with bread and a little onion, and then she called Rell and asked if the north gate could be made to burp with theatricality at three in the afternoon, because she had decided to make a crowd move away from an amphitheatre with a river noise instead of a baton. Rell promised her a burp so dignified it would be quoted in alleys for a week, and Jana felt the peculiar happiness of a day in which women who have never met are pulling on the same rope and the rope has decided to be useful.\n\nBy mid-afternoon they had answered three messages written in chalk and one note carved into paint with a key, and the charity that had been laundering fear came to them with a clean statement and an empty ledger and the boss with the beard somewhere learning that you cannot invoice a river without first paying for your name. They were a block from Angel\u2019s Crossback again because all stories when they are honest end up under their first bridge, and there the child who had drawn a figure-eight on his step stood with a borrowed broom and a plan in his face; he explained that the older boys had tried to draw circles on the sidewalk at the place where the scooter delivery men like to ruin ankles, and he had corrected them by throwing water and telling them about the sentence, and he had said now and they had laughed at him, and then the gate had burped like a man who has had more soup than fits in his suit and the boys had decided to go shoplift snacks somewhere else. Twyning awarded him the authority of being right by asking him to show her his chalk and asking him if he would be offended if she stole a piece because grown women have to learn from children without taking their pockets along with the lesson.\n\nThe Curator of Underspeech sent them another envelope, lighter paper this time, and inside it a smaller knot tied with hair that glinted like something the river itself might have dropped when it thought no one was watching, and a sentence that said that he had found his home and would defend it with rituals approved by committees. Jana held the knot up and said, with honest respect edged with a need to win, that he had been clever to let his hair be what it was without pretending to be old, and Twyning said that she had known men who tied their family names to deeds and believed it was the same as children, and that this man would learn the difference when a drain refused his permission. They did not go to him. They made him come to a place that did not love him, which in this case was the undercarriage of the tram line between the hospital and the stadium, where the concrete had taken the weight of a thousand touchdowns and a million sodium-lit apologies and felt no obligation to pretend it was a cathedral.\n\nHe arrived in a coat that believed weather took orders and a face that had arranged itself to be disappointed, and he stood under the tram and tried to make a stage out of a place where rust actually grows from air and not just from water. Jana waited until he had placed his feet on the terrible green kiss of pigeon leavings, and then she told him the truth that men in coat rooms never hear spoken below carpets; she said that any ritual worth doing could be done in the dark with one hand because you have a baby on your hip with the other, and his knot had hands that had never picked up a child who had fallen asleep in a doorway while waiting for soup. He steadied himself by producing a certificate and a permit in a clear sleeve and announcing that he had been tasked with standardizing undercity engagement, and he spoke the sentence in an accent that had learned its vowels from countries that call rain an event.\n\nTwyning listened like a riverbed listens, which is to say she measured him against the way the water will behave and found him lighter than he had admitted to being, and then she spoke, not to the man but to the tram line, in the same voice she used when she asked Rell for gates and grandmothers for forgiveness; she said there would be noise now because a crowd needed to step back, and the tram complied by ignoring her because it was busy, but the people complied by finding themselves twelve inches further away from the undercarriage than they had been when the man\u2019s permit was new. Mavery stood directly above the Curator on the platform and tossed into the air a handful of dull glitter she had made from ground zip ties and lint, and when it came down in the light it looked like a bad idea deciding not to be born.\n\nThey argued, but they did it not as men and women do on television with words sharpened for brand, and not as mobs do when they smell blood and want theater, but as neighbors who have to share a hallway and an elevator and a garbage chute and therefore know the price of winning. The Curator said that if the city did not invent a taxonomy for its monsters, someone else would, and he preferred the monsters to have footnotes and grants; Jana replied that the monsters had already invented themselves when the roads had been ripped up and that no footnote has ever stopped a boy from wanting to put his hands on a friend\u2019s throat to see what science feels like. Twyning told him that his lowercase was a trick to make violence whisper, and that she had been trained by shouting and silence and neither had fooled her, and he blinked because she had moved his pointer to the other side of the room without touching it.\n\nWhen it was over\u2014because argument has end points like bridges do if you have the good sense to stop building somewhere\u2014the Curator gave up a list without admitting that it was a list; he named the two community partners who had provided him with hair and access to drains and he excused it by saying something about lived experience that would have read better in a brochure; he confessed the gate he\u2019d bribed to open not to water but to donors; he claimed that if they let him keep one bridge he could prove that community can be managed. Jana told him he could keep a model and speak into its plastic as long as he liked and she would cut his microphone when he tried to make his toy swallow a river, and Mavery offered to sell him a candle that smelled like humility for his office and then told him she was joking and watched the relief curdle into a promise of revenge he probably couldn\u2019t afford. Jallo took a photograph of the underside of the tram, not because it would look good in a report but because there is value in showing men who make maps that their city has angles they cannot print.\n\nNight requested permission to perform itself and was told to come in and make tea. The gates sounded like old friends unashamed of their coughs. Under Angel\u2019s Crossback, soup happened again, not as a demonstration but as something to do with hands that had been making fists all day and had run out of useful targets. Someone hung a string of lights from one rail to the other as if bridges were arms that wanted to wear jewelry when the work was not too heavy, and Jana got a glimpse of what the undercity could be if greed were persuaded to shave its eyebrows for a year and sit quietly and learn to slice onions without cutting its fingers. Twyning counted children by the sound of their shoes and adulthoods by the sound of their sighs and knew that tonight very few of them would be demanded by good television because the river had been fed sentences and broth and had chosen to stop escalating.\n\nAfter midnight, when the van had done its animal breaths and the city had become domestic in the way of beasts that have eaten well and are thinking about sleeping near the fire instead of hunting the dark for myth, they went to the pool. Jana\u2019s mattress was there because home is sometimes where the lifeguard chair has a shadow that knows your name, and the tiles had decided not to remember water for a few hours to spare her dreams. They did not talk about the next day because talking about the next day attracts gods who think you are daring them to ruin your plans, and they did not say the sentence because you only say it when you need to instruct a pipe or a crowd and the only thing that required instructing here was the desire to tell a story that made you sound braver than you had been. Twyning took out the knot from her pocket and untied it in her mind and retied it as an absence, which is how caretakers sleep when they can.\n\nIn the morning, which arrived like a bill\u2014expected, dull, and requiring money you had already spent\u2014they were summoned by a sound that was not gate, not police, not hospital. It was a whistle from the old factories, a child of steam that had learned to imitate a man shouting across water and refusing to be drowned, and it came from a quarter that had not yet had to admit that the river could be an employer. The message underneath was easy to read if you had spent long enough letting markets in dreamland alleys teach you their shorthand: the charity with the Friday-night face was emptying itself before dawn, and trucks were moving plastic crates that had never held food. Mavery rolled off a bench, braided her hair like a plan, and said she had a friend at the gate who preferred soup to paperwork, and Jana stretched and found that sleep had braided itself around her in a knot you could untie without cutting if you were gentle.\n\nThey reached the yard before the sun climbed into fussy clarity and found the men who had run the charity\u2019s laundering\u2014of fear, of ritual, of small, clean community work\u2014loading a pallet with the kind of caution that comes from carrying things that should have been declared significantly earlier in the week. Twyning showed them her clipboard first because there is a species of thief who respects the shape of an office more than they fear any weapon, and she asked whether their exit interview had gone well in a voice that made one man, the one with sleeves that ended in ink and regret, tell her which truck had the hair and which had the money. Jana saw the coil of zip ties that had been used to persuade a pipe to say the wrong names and she felt that thin clean anger that she knew to be a better tool than rage because it has handles and you can set it down without burning the room.\n\nThey did not do raids, which leave bruises that become a martyr\u2019s explanation for later crimes; they did inventory, which leaves audits and signed forms and the kind of boredom that makes bad men forget to run. Jallo took numbers like a harvester brings in wheat, precise and tired and briefly happy, and wrote receipts for things nobody should have owned and filed them in a folder that had quiet teeth. Mavery sipped from a cup that had never seen tea and leaned into a corner where a camera believed the night had not ended, and she said into the dark that she had candles that smelled like waiting and she would trade them for names; someone gave her a name spelled in two languages and a secret in one, and she put one in her pocket and gave the other to the floor where secrets get turned into chalk later.\n\nBy noon, Command had invented a patrol for the manipulation of ritual, which was almost funny, and the minister had broken a sentence in two and left the wrong half lying on the floor of a studio. The Curator of Underspeech sent a third envelope, this one with hair that had been washed in something expensive that claimed to be river-colored, and inside there was a chart with lines that wanted to prove that ritual could be measured and sold at wholesale if you put enough commas between the words. Jana tacked it to the wall of the pool and threw a paper airplane at it and Mavery clapped because failure is a kind of performance art you don\u2019t have to charge admission for if you are generous.\n\nIn the afternoon, a mother took a chalk and drew a figure-eight on the door of a school and told three girls that they could say now and home when they were frightened, and a boy took his grandmother\u2019s coin and rolled it until it sang like a small loud river and did not go into the stairwell with the printed splurge a boy offered him in exchange for content. In the late afternoon, the old soldier who had given his name to the Angel\u2019s Crossback in stories twice died in a way nobody can write because he had in fact moved two towns over and decided to grow beans, and the bridge continued to collect taxes in the language of footsteps and soup spills and brief apologies, and Twyning made a note to visit the beans when this lull finished. In the evening, a woman tied her own hair into a knot over her door and said out loud that if anybody came to sell her safety she would ask them whether they took pickles off sandwiches for their friends, and when the salesman frowned she knew to shut the door.\n\nThey wanted to sleep, but there was the envelope and the hair and the quiet promise that someone else had a map and was laying it over theirs, and so they went out into the dark city that knows merit and marks it in ways a minister cannot list. They went to the place where men plan floods and they scratched a figure-eight into a wall they would never admit to scratching and they left a bowl of soup where a rat who could have been a saint could eat it. They went to the place where a girl had tied a razor to a string and spun it until it sang and they told the balcony the sentence and the balcony let go of a habit it had been cultivating in secret and felt better. They went until the river looked up and said, in its not-voice, that it had been wavering and now it would settle, and for a few hours, enough to let people put their heads down without bargaining with air, it kept its promise.\n\nMorning was waiting behind curtains because cities hoard dawn for people who have earned it, and when the light came mending through the fissures of the pool\u2019s glass, Jana had a thought that belonged to old women and young liars: that staying would kill her faster than running and that leaving would solve nothing except the problem of her own breathing. Twyning woke with a list already unspooling behind her eyes and a craving for bread that had to be dipped, and she considered writing a letter to the caretaker who would take her chair when she was finally made to stop walking and say: the city is good when you ask it to be better, and sometimes that is the only technology that matters. Mavery blew smoke into a jar and sealed it and wrote on the lid the word luck and put it on a shelf because she was tired of pretending she did not believe in stupid, solid things.\n\nThey took the van to a place where cranes rested their necks and listened to women swear, and the river flat-out refused a sponsor that wanted to rename a pier after a detergent, and somewhere, holding a coffee that had taught itself how to be bitter without being deep, the Curator stared at his empty knot box and decided to come and see if the undercity\u2019s home was bigger than his because lowercase was not saving him from wanting capital. He came without a camera and without his coat, and he stood under Angel\u2019s Crossback at an hour when only people who have errands and losses are awake, and he said please in a way that made Twyning lend him a chair and a bowl because she believed in being paid with better enemies. He asked how to tie the knot that meant not here and how to untie the one that meant me first, and Jana showed him with her hands in the air so he would have to come to the drain if he wanted to repeat it, and when he did, later, with salt and with a hair that had not been stolen, the pipe did not mock him. He told them, while he was learning, that there was a last bridge where someone neither of them owned had tied something ancient and airtight, and that it had pulled at him the way a train pulls at a coin left on its rail, and that he could not do anything about it with lowercase or permits or men whose shoes did not squeak.\n\nThey went. Of course they went. They went because the sentence in the envelope had been a bell and because the city likes to see if the people who claim it are willing to count the steps to a place where even daylight crouches low. They went to a bridge that had no name because history had mislaid it and the current administration didn\u2019t want to encourage sentiment about things that could not be monetized. It wore vines like a widow and clung to a bank that had been promised a park if the funds came through by winter, and underneath, in the place where girls who need to scream go when they cannot alarm their mothers, a knot hung that did not incorporate hair at all. Jana felt its pull and knew that whoever had tied it belonged to neither soup nor permit; it had been made of twine and sins and one of the old languages that forgets vowels when it curses, and it did not hum, it listened. Twyning stood with her feet apart and her mouth shut and her bones ready to protest, and she felt in her hip the little prayer grow very still as if an older religious practice had entered the room and wanted to see its papers.\n\nThis one would not be cut by razors or softened by salt. This one had to be addressed and asked; it had to be treated like a grandmother with a knife\u2014respected, negotiated with, refused only if you had nothing else to lose. They stood together with the Curator a step back because he had been told to be humble and had decided to practice once in his life, and they let the city make a sound that was not whistle, not pipe, not drone, not applause. It was the sound a home makes when rent is due and payday is an hour too far and the bridge between what you have and what you need has to be made out of sentences you can afford. Jana spoke first because trolls have to, and she said now so it would hear her, and Twyning ended with home because she wanted it to know she was not advising, she was promising, and Mavery picked out of her pocket a coin that had been rolled smooth by four generations and put it in the knot as if giving a god a tip for being patient, and the knot did not change shape but the air did, and with that small breath, something in the city agreed to be slightly less cruel in the morning.",

Twyning was summoned with a document that pretended to be a courtesy and a panel that called itself Public Assurance, and the Curator of Underspeech was already in a chair when she entered, lowercase tucked in his collar like a saint\u2019s relic. They had a screen with the city peeled like fruit on it and a bar at the bottom for sentiments. They had a plan to formalize rituals, to number tolls, to turn sentences into bullet points that could be financed. Twyning sat with a patience that made one junior official check his clock because he felt late for something, and when they asked her whether the Brethren would accept a pilot project to standardize community gateways, she smiled like a woman who is honest about her age and said she had seen men standardize grief and had watched women continue to invent funerals that worked. The Curator avoided her eyes until she mentioned soup, and then he looked up because he had not yet learned how to dislike being taught by a person with broth on her sleeve.\n\nJana had woken with the old knot sitting on her tongue like a word she wasn\u2019t allowed to say in a polite house. The thing under the nameless bridge pulled sideways on her breath all day, and every drain she passed hummed in a key shifted a fractional hair low, as if the city had been told a joke and was trying not to laugh because the telling had been bad. Children had begun to leave offerings that belonged to them in the way only children\u2019s offerings do: a marbled shooter with a crack and therefore more luck trapped inside it, a ribbon from a braid that had been cut because heat makes girls rash, a stone too thin to be useful and therefore valuable. Someone tucked between the bricks three bones from a soup that had lasted a week and tasted better each day, and Jana touched them with two fingers and recognized hunger turned into currency. The old knot was listening. It had a grandmother\u2019s ears and a blade warming on her apron. It would not be bought with sponsorships or shots where a drone tilted politely to turn suffering into weather.\n\nBy noon the pipes spoke in a new register that could not be captured by any microphone. Words failed on screens in little patches as if the algorithm had caught a skin complaint. Up on the rail a boy started to tell a story about the stairwell and found himself bereft of adjectives, and the silence that followed his mouth was more dangerous than a shout. The grandmother with the knife had reached a hand into the room and closed it around the trick we had all adopted, the one where we survive by ornamenting our regret until it sells. The price, when it came, was the only one worth paying. She wanted stories told true and heard, not performed, in exchange for a city that would continue to hum. Twyning understood the levy before anyone wrote it on a whiteboard. She sent children to carry cards to stoops and benches, and the cards said with pantry-plain words: bring your voice and your bread under a bridge tonight; sit down; be the audience someone else has never had; the toll is to listen.\n\nCommand tried to call it a program and to issue a hashtag, and the hashtag sputtered like a match in the wet. The river took the habit of evenings and made it liturgy. Under the third bridge, under the Angel\u2019s Crossback, under a broken arch in a back alley with a drain that had never seen daylight, people sat in an ellipse with bowls, and a man whose face had been shaved by Jana until it could pass for statuary told a story about the time his mother had refused a medal so she could keep the box and hide her rent in it. A girl with a knee scar the shape of a bread slice told about falling and the grandmother who salted each scrape as if healing were a stew that required seasoning to remember its work. They were not good at it at first. They narrated the way people do when they are still applying for a job that doesn\u2019t exist. Little by little the old knot\u2019s knife relaxed. Little by little the pipes began to lean their heads in as if courted by a song for once tailored to their age.\n\nThe new cartridges Mavery had brewed uncurled like weather, amber as a traffic light that knows when to let the children cross. Their smell was rain after the first lightning, a clean the city remembers in its joints the way a dancer remembers a step a decade after she quits. Boys who might have printed their courage in kitchens paused a minute longer when confronted with a shade that didn\u2019t promise marvelous, only consequence. One tried to copy and ended up with a brown sugar sludge that jammed first and then fell in love with the floor, and the laughter that followed that moment was the useful kind, the sort that leaves its thumbprint on shame and then shakes your hand.\n\nThe contractors did not stop because money does not know how to hear \u201cenough.\u201d They rolled out Public Safety Corridors in the Lower Blocks with an app that wanted you to register your fear for points you could redeem for a discount on a branded lantern. The guards they hired wore empathy on their uniforms like a patch you iron on because it costs less than learning the skill, and they called their batons \u201cbehavior correctors\u201d while insisting they had never in their lives struck anything without remorse. The Curator stood with a clipboard four feet from those men and hated that his name was now on their paperwork. He sent Jallo a copy of a contract in which the word ritual had been defined by a man who filed a patent on grief the year the water climbed the third step, and Jallo, who had never before performed espionage and prepared to repent for it, walked the pages down to Twyning with his collar warm and his face set in the shape he wore when he lied to a minister about resource allocation and said it later in the kind of confessional that still makes old women get up and make a sandwich.\n\nIt would have been easier if all wrongs stood in one line, if the bearded brand-safety man could be flattened by one sentence and a well-timed burp from the north gate. But the city is a dial, not a switch. It turns incremental, it ratchets, it needs wrenching and release in alternation until the thread catches. Mavery\u2019s supply lines were threatened by men with delicate shoes who sent her health code inspections as flirtations and warnings that her stall would be removed to make room for a vendor who sold candles that smelled like contracts. She strung the ceiling over her corner of the market with rain cartridges connected by a wire as thin as superstition and as strong, and when a man in shoes stepped through with a measuring tape and a smile learned in a mirror, she pulled a string and made the whole block smell like a storm. He turned his head the way a child does when thunder is new and left with his tape feeling smaller in his pocket and a plan to file paperwork that would die in a pile because the city had decided to prefer weather over men\u2019s increments for the afternoon.\n\nThe woman in pink slippers came to the van with her hair braided not as plea but as statement, and said in a voice scrubbed like a bowl after bread dough has been taken out of it that she had signed a paper that made her safe and that her man with the dog had been moved to a room where the windows didn\u2019t open and would stay as long as she needed him not to be walking around. She asked if there was a rule about shaving that applied to women who had been told that if they changed their hair they would change their luck, and Jana answered before Twyning because this piece belonged to her. She said she did not shave women to mark them, that razors turned away from the story written under the jawline and toward the story written on the scalp too easily, and that if the woman wanted a new face to greet herself with she could sit with Mavery for the price of a cartridge and a debt that didn\u2019t smell like grapes, and Mavery would tend the eyebrows back with patience instead of taking a tax with chrome. The woman nodded and left with a small bag that looked like a drug only to people who do not keep combs in their houses, and the pink slippers slapped the stairs with gladness in a rhythm that made three children think of drums, and the dog tattoo across the hall lifted two ears because there are signs even ink learns to respect.\n\nWhen the old knot tested them, it did it by removing a sound nobody knew they needed until it was absent. The undercity went quiet between two breaths. The pipes held their noise as a teacher holds a scolding to let it gather effect, and the crowd standing under Angel\u2019s Crossback felt the hair on their arms do that thing that makes the mouth assemble prayers it had deleted. It wasn\u2019t the emergency tone that tastes like copper, and it wasn\u2019t the building alarm that makes you remember whether you left the burner on. It was the loss of hum, of city\u2019s throat singing to itself, that big animal comfort. Jana placed the razor on the rail because superstition wanted its hands free, and she and Twyning did the sentence divide as if it had always been a duet; Jana took the now and let it ripen across her tongue until it was a verb big enough to shelter a dozen frightened knees, and Twyning hugged the home in from the edges with a gravity that made the bolts in the bridge turn their heads. Plastic cameras caught nothing but their own fans. The hum returned not like an apology but like a friend who has been asked to be quiet for a minute so someone else could say their piece and who returns, grudging and loyal.\n\nThey understood what the old thing wanted then. It wanted a tithe in attention. It wanted the city to learn to be an audience before it would agree to continue to be a stage. So they built nights around telling. They forbade clapping and encouraged breath. They outlawed commentary and permitted soup, which kept mouths busy. Grandmothers taught boys how to sit on their hands. A pair of teenage girls told the second half of a story they had never been allowed to begin, and the second half proved sufficient for a week. Len from the gate came one evening and spoke about his aunt in the old factory, about thread and how machines learn your hands and then betray your sleep, and the river made a softer shape with its mouth when he said her name.\n\nIt is possible to love an enemy the way a locksmith loves a door. The Curator proved it by showing up at strange hours with permits he had decided to ignore and a willingness to carry folding chairs. He had decided to defect from a piece of his salary and it had cost his jaw an unhappy tension; lowercase does not survive revolution well. He told them about the board where the brand-safety man had a seat, about the old donor whose child had never had to count steps in the dark and had convinced fairness that it was a synonym for content moderation. He told them the routes the security men took and the spot under the tram where a third envelope had been planned, and he confessed that he had used to believe in stitchable communities until he heard a drain say no. He inched toward a name people could say without wanting to roll it in flour, and in the meantime Twyning called him by a nonsense word that meant \u201cnot enemy yet,\u201d and it sat well on him.\n\nThe bearded man returned with his superior, who was a superior in the old way, the way that has several suits in a closet and a house that will never forgive its own mortgage because both parties have agreed to pretend the other is important. They pushed for injunctions and sent letters stamped with a red that had never seen blood or beets. Mavery printed their faces on paper, put hearts around them, and taped them to the underside of a pedestrian bridge where the pigeons could review their expressions. The city\u2019s affection is hungry for a particular kind of shame, and the men found themselves recognized in bakeries where they had never paid with cash and looked over their shoulders under the eyes of laundries that had recorded their grandmothers\u2019 skirts. They signed something they did not have time to read and found themselves rebranded away from ritual management and toward flood insurance, which made them sad because terror is less marketable when it is honest.\n\nJallo, who had given up sleep for a week and had started to speak to the coffee machine as if it were a friend whose character could be improved, made a map of wrong knots with a pencil and a thread stolen from a grandmother\u2019s repair basket. He traced the line from the docks to the nameless bridge to the Spindle to the tram and saw that somebody tried to make a neat square in a city that hates squares unless they are made of bread. He brought the map to the pool and pinned it to the bulletin board next to a flyer for a dance class for people whose knees tell the truth, and as he did it his hand paused over the nameless bridge and drew a circle without meaning to. Jana saw the circle and felt the twine-and-sins knot pull, and she said \u201cwe go now\u201d like promise and hunger braided, and Twyning nodded because it was the hour when adults do things children ought not to.\n\nThey went with the Curator carrying a stool and Mavery carrying a secret, and the river took a breath that wasn\u2019t drama, just preparation. The nameless bridge wore its vines like an inaccurate history, and the knot beneath it listened with a severity that made even the smart-mouths in the group swallow their lines. You could not cut this one. To cut would be to teach the city that old things have to defend themselves with a lawsuit, and this one would have lost, and then who would keep knives honest. Twyning took a slice of stale bread from her bag, and the stale mattered because fresh suggests you can afford to bake every day and compromise works only if you admit your pantry. Mavery put on the ground a candle that smelled like soap and rain and burned almost not at all because air here was a cousin of water. Jana took the razor and laid it heavy on the rail; that meant she would use her voice instead of her steel and it was the larger concession of the two.\n\nLen\u2019s aunt came because none of their mouths knew the oldest rituals and hers did. She wore a coat like a ship and shoes of a geometry that cities respect. She did not like soup when it has too much pepper, and she had a story that began with Now because she woke to owls in a dormitory and the night nurse had no sugar for her tea and the girl in the bed across had a cough that took her three winters later fixed to a man\u2019s chest and would not be quiet. She said it slow like hem stitch, and at the right place she put in a detail about twine because that was the debt this knot had asked for. The city is practical; it pays attention when you get the costuming right. Jana lifted her own hair and tied a single long strand to the fringe of the old knot, not to own it or dress it, but to leash herself to its mercy for the length of a breath. The Curator did the humble thing and gave one hair in view of his own lowercased pride, and Twyning laundered a coin with spit in a grandmother\u2019s gesture that ignores germs and attends to bad luck, and she pressed it into the knot with a thumb that will ache when the rain is honest. The knot shifted. That is all the kind of agreement you can expect from grandmothers with knives. It shifted and listened as if someone had finally answered a question and not just responded.\n\nThe old thing took its tithe. For three nights people sat under bridges and told stories that had to be true for once and had to be about shame and kindness and vegetables and being wrong about someone and paying later on purpose. There were no drones because detecting sincerity is above their grade. Command sent one caretaker with a clipboard to each sitting and told them to collect data, and each caretaker put the clipboard under their chair and learned a story and then went home and slept without having to count breaths to trick their heart into slowing. The pipes settled into their older song, a major key clink that no conservatory would praise because it was too necessary. The bearded man wrote a think piece and nobody bought it because the city had turned its head to listen elsewhere and missed his performance.\n\nJana went to see the girl with the razor on the string and found her sitting on a balcony with her hair in a tight coil like a snake that has decided to nap instead of bite. They talked about wrists and risk and the way a thing can sing you into stupidity if you let its hum take your balance, and then they went under the balcony and tied a scumble that said not here without showing off while a boy in a shirt that made a noise when he moved tried to make a joke and failed and felt better because failure in front of women who do not mock you is rare and restorative.\n\nTwyning met a woman on a bench with a bag of bread that had been meant for pigeons and convinced her that pigeons do better on pretensions than on carbohydrates, and they fed the bread to a girl who had sung her throat sore telling the truth three nights and needed something to line it with. Jallo went to see a priest and confessed to stealing a contract and was absolved with a laugh that tasted like onions and paper, and he went back to his desk and took three calls from boys who had been brave in the wrong direction and wanted someone older to tell them it would not be a habit if they did not let it be. The Curator collected a new card from his office that said Consultant and brought it to Twyning to ask if he should keep it. She told him to write Auntie\u2019s Boy on the back and show it to anyone who wanted to hire him to make myth into metrics, and he walked away laughing and then stopped because there was a knot of anger in his chest he had mistaken for conviction for years and he needed to undo it with salt and with apologies.\n\nOn the fourth night the old knot sent a sign as odd as any they had seen. A bundle of twine had been left under the nameless bridge, tied around a chunk of ballast worn smooth by a thousand river mouths and four floods, and stuffed inside were three items that came from different centuries and endured the same city: a bus ticket with the ink half-slept off by a pocket with lint, a needle rusted to a romantic color, and a butter knife with a mother-of-pearl handle that would have lived in a drawer beside acceptable lies and holiday napkins. Mavery unwrapped them as if in front of a camera though there wasn\u2019t one, and Jana recognized the ugliness and utility of each and felt a dignity rise in her that had nothing to do with notoriety. Twyning took the knife and used it to slice an onion over a pot and cried from the onion and from the thought that someone had chosen the right relic for this soup, and they fed the neighborhood until the bowl was polished by repetition and the old knot breathed out through the vines like a woman at a window watching her street up to the hour it is safe to sleep.\n\nThe quiet challenge of the envelope returned with dawn, slid under a door by a hand that had begun to learn how to repress flourish. The sentence on this paper was different. It said: now I will listen if you will teach, and it was signed not with a name but with a drawing of a figure-eight that crossed itself at a point slightly higher than the chalk version, as if the writer believed in breath held a second too long before laughter, which is a kind of vanity but less deadly than many. Jana put the page beside the knot in her palm that had been tied by him earlier and saw that taste, under discipline, could migrate toward usefulness. Twyning placed her finger on the dot where the figure-eight met and said a word that women keep to themselves because it loses value when men polish it with their mouths. Mavery wrote the name of the bearded man\u2019s sponsor on a piece of tape and stuck it to the sole of her shoe so she could grind it on pavement without fuss.\n\nThere were still boys printing splurges in kitchens, but now they were likely to walk to a bridge and sit outside the circle and listen until their shoulders stopped trying on shapes they could not afford. There were still knives tied to strings on balconies, but now they were being used to slice bread, and the cuts that happened were the kind that tell you how to hold your fingers forever afterward. There were still men with cards in their pockets that said they owned the undercity, and those cards still worked in rooms where the air-conditioning had been instructed to compel the poor to wear sweaters, but in the drains names had changed. Under Angel\u2019s Crossback someone had scrawled in soot and soap: Pay with attention. Under the Spindle, a child had written home in a sharp childish hand and drawn a figure-eight the size his fingers could comfortably manage. Under the nameless bridge, the old knot heard it all and worked a little faster because knitting for company is kinder than knitting alone.\n\nIt rained. Real rain, not bottled, not perplexed through cartridges, the sort that cities loathe for their own reasons and love because afterwards they are forgiven for a day. The gates held in a manner that makes workers curse and admire their own luck. Rell at the controls fell asleep in her chair for ten minutes and dreamed of beans growing up in polite green steps over the third stair where the water had once promised to move in. Twyning kept a towel around her neck and her mouth ready to speak a sentence that would keep foolishness off the rail. Jana stood barefoot in a puddle until the bottoms of her feet told her a story about childhood she had not consented to hear and did not object to. Mavery hung a string from the lifeguard chair and watched rain bead along it into her cup, and she drank and told nobody that it tasted like a very old woman carrying a knife under her skirt so a man would talk less and work more, because some compliments you keep to yourself to use like coin when the city forgets you paid last time.\n\nThe day ended as workdays end in cities that have earned their sleep. There were fewer drones, and the ones that came were baffled and ended up filming soup, which was good tape but stubbornly unprofitable. There were more chalk marks, some drawn wrong, some corrected by muffled household hands. There were in-boxes filled with questions about ritual submitted by men who spelled it correctly and meant revenue, and there were women outside Council doors with prepared stories and no compulsion to smile. There were curtains drawn back and lines for bread made shorter by boys who understood that lines indicate a possibility you are expected to honor. There were knots tied right and knots tied wrong and the knowledge that neither would stay unless someone fed them with attention like yeast.\n\nThey slept that night because the old knot had accepted payment and because the city was too tired to be clever. They slept because soup had been consumed and pickles had been removed where appropriate and a man with a dog on his shoulder had been told to sit and his value in the economy of fear had been correctly discounted. They slept because in the pool a candle that smelled like soap burned out and left only clean air behind. They slept because the sentence had done its work and would do it again and because now and home were not just words but plumbing, and the pipes appreciated that. They slept because tomorrow there would be more boys with cartridges, and more contracts written by men who call themselves stewards and mean owners, and more bridges that wanted necklaces, and because they had decided to be the sort of tired you wear as a ribbon, not the sort that makes you mean.\n\nIn the morning the envelope lay at the threshold again, and this time the hair tied in the knot was gray and wiry as wire scrubbers and looped as if the fingers that tied it had arthritis. It smelled not of rain, not of grapes, not of fear, but of flour and oil and coins, a grandmother\u2019s pocket. There were no words. There was a crumb of bread stuck in the twist. Jana laughed quietly at nothing and everything and kissed her thumb and pressed it to the knot as she had once pressed it to men\u2019s brows, and Twyning nodded like a captain whose ship has finally learned to like the ocean and who can sleep in storms if the ropes sing correctly. They went back to work because the work was older than them and would outlast them, and that is a relief when you choose not to be the center of a city but its decent gravity.",
