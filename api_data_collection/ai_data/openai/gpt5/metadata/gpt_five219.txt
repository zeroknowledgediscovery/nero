The night got in through the skylight first. A thin wedge of city glow slipped across the staffroom whiteboard and chalked over words like safeguarding, term dates, staff karaoke. It haloed the mug rack and the fat little tin where detentions were clipped with paper hearts, the joke of a kind teacher who would never empty it again.

She moved with the careful quiet of something that had learned to be quiet before it learned to be anything else. Catalina unfolded from behind the photocopier, a grey green blur that was sometimes a shadow, sometimes the shape of a girl’s nightmare. If you looked straight at her she resolved: hunched shoulders beneath a threadbare coat, hair the colour of coin-bright moss, eyes that had stared too long at damp. If you looked to the side she was smaller. She was least frightening in the reflection on the staffroom microwave, which made her look like a child pressed against a window.

“Good evening,” she said, to no one there.

On the laminate table, Miss Hamish’s mouth had stopped. Catalina had stopped it. A heavy stapler had done the work and then a quick loop of coaxial cable because that was what was there. Her hands had been busy, almost fast enough to outrun the tightness in her throat. Almost. She had pushed Miss Hamish’s glasses up, gently, because the woman had once told a boy he could sing. The small mercy wasn’t for Miss Hamish but for the sound in Catalina’s head that had started when she was very young and never stopped, never let her sleep, the sound of an apology that would not be believed.

“I am not a monster,” she told the poster of departmental goals. “I am a poor decision speaking through old teeth.”

The words hiccuped. She laughed, and the laugh missed the place laughter normally lives.

Her camera was an old Nikon with tape across its battery cover, the kind that always worked even if you dropped it. She had found it on a brick at a car boot sale with rain still on the lens and the seller with a face like the underside of a kettle offering it to her for five pounds because no one prints anything anymore, love. Catalina had printed. Catalina still believed in paper.

She drew in close. The lips. Lipstick smudged by the day and by the last minute of it, by the rasp of breathing that had clawed and then surrendered. Miss Hamish had been reading a note when the weight fell on her; now the note was folded into the breast pocket of her blouse. Catalina did not look at it. She would look later, when the dark in her head needed an illustration.

Light flashed soft-blue in the room. She took three photographs. One dead centre. One with the lips slightly parted. One with her own nail, chipped green varnish, in the frame, like proof-of-life from the other side of a childhood.

“You told him he could sing,” she whispered to the lips. “And that is almost as good as telling me.”

On the whiteboard, under someone’s rushed handwriting about the phonics evening, there was a doodle of a goblin. Catalina tilted her head. The goblin had fangs and a speech bubble that read: Mark, stop stealing jam. She smiled at the crude little monster, and her mouth went all wrong with the smiling.

They had called her that once. When she was smaller, when her spine and her patience had grown sideways. Goblin girl, gobbling girl, greedy for attention, greedy for words. Because greed is what the small are accused of when their hunger is inconvenient to the tall.

She hung the camera back around her neck. The strap rasped her collarbone. She pulled a cheap plastic phone from the deep of her coat and clicked to her gallery to look at the other mouths. Mr. Perryman, who had taught maths and believed silence to be proof of comprehension. Ms. Rawlings, drama, all bangles and perfume and in the end a surprising steadiness when Catalina’s shadow fell across her. A deputy head with a voice like sandpaper. A supply who couldn’t keep the names right until everyone was wrong.

She had written names in a pale brown notebook. Beside each name, a single sentence. Slap for left-handedness. Chewing gum confiscated with two fingers and a laugh. Please use your inside voice. That last written three times.

Regret keeps you dignified, she wrote in her head, tasting the words, pressing them into herself the way a child presses acorns into mud. Regret keeps you upright, like a bad back. There had been no one to say this. There had been words like sorry directed at a space near her shoulder while the lips moved like a fish on a pier.

A scrape in the corridor.

Catalina froze. Her ears were sharper than most, not because she was not human — she had stopped believing that as soon as she became a secret — but because the sabotage of her upbringing had sharpened what was left. Nighttime school had many noises: radiators belching, a fox in the bin cage, a cleaner the budget could not afford. This was the key in the front door and the delayed oath of a caretaker.

She lowered herself to the floor with a sinuous little movement, like a cat who had learned shame. Under the table. The caretaker’s steps clicked, hesitant. He made a sound that might have been a name or a cough, and then the door opened.

“Miss?”

No answer. He took three steps in, then two steps back because he saw the strap of the camera.

Catalina did not kill the caretaker. He had been cruel in a small way once to a child he thought was lying about a mother’s absence, but there were so many small ways, and she could not carry them all. She slid along the underside of the table and melted into the dark angle behind the recycling bin. The caretaker swore softly and dialed a number.

She waited until he said the words. There’s someone. The police. Yes, immediately. Then Catalina rose up in a shadow that had already been in the room, and she slipped past him and along the corridor and out into the night. She had to duck under the iron gate, and she felt the grin scrape her face when the metal tried to comb her hair. When she reached the road she stood a moment in the orange flare of the streetlamp and she lifted the camera and shot herself, her own mouth, open like a wound, the awkward angle not flattering, but then she never was.

In the staffroom, Miss Hamish continued to be dead with a kind of politeness. On the whiteboard the doodle goblin kept guarding the jam. The caretaker said the words you say to dispatchers who know less of your building than you do, and nowhere in any of those words was the memory of the child the child the child with the small hands that had tried to offer him money to sign a permission slip because mother had lost her pen. He would remember later, when it would not be of use.

By the time the blue arrived, Catalina had walked under the railway bridge and into the brittle kind of November that cracks underfoot.

The call came at 03:17 and she was awake already, because some bodies learn the hour that expects them and then behave. Rea answered with one thumb while her other hand covered the alarm display because it was too much light.

“Doctor.”

A pause; she could hear the wire of it. The reluctance to put one label over another. “Detective,” she corrected softly. “I’m listening.”

“South of the river. Primary school. Female teacher. Likely homicide. Photographer did a—” The voice snagged on its own metaphor. “There’s a mark we think you should see.”

“I’m not the Met,” Rea said, not because it was a refusal, but because she needed to say it aloud. She needed to hear the sentence settle in the room like a small bird.

“Crawley sends its best. We’ve all seen your notes on similar,” the voice came back, a little kinder, like someone drawing their thumb along a crease.

The little flat on Pelling Rise was too warm. In the hallway the coat rack leaned to one side, swallowing umbrellas and a scarf that had been dipped in tea and then laundered. A half-packed box with chirurgic textbooks sat by the door with a paper label that read Not Now.

Rea kept a white coat in the wardrobe even though she no longer wore it. It had been a long time since she’d stood at the foot of a bed with a name written on an index card and said I’m sorry. A different apology now. Harder in some ways. Easier in others, perhaps because the dead did not expect as much of her once they had gone.

Her hair was tied already and she had slept in the black jersey she could put under a suit jacket and call it morning. She left the bedside lamp on and locked the door behind her and went out into a street that was still mostly made of the previous day.

Crawley was asleep, that utilitarian neatness only occasionally broken by somebody’s front garden going feral, or a crash of bins near the kebab shop. She drove out past the mall with its bright teeth, past the roundabout where her father had taught her the little dance of indicators, past the bit where concrete gives up and London starts without admitting it. She thought of what the voice had said. Photographer did. As if taking a picture were an action like grip, or choke, a verb with its own set of fingerprints.

The school looked the same as all of them do in weather like that: a block crouched in the small of the city, stained by the hands of many children. The police tape fluttered as if telling a story to itself. There was someone smoking by the bike rack, and someone else telling him to quit, and then both of them going quiet when Rea showed her ID.

“You’re the doc?” The uniformed man had timid eyebrows which made everything he said sound like a question.

“Yes,” she said, and then, because habit dies on its own schedule, “and no. Show me.”

The staffroom had been tidied in the way crime scenes are when they are still new: cups bunched away from the body; a highlighter pushed into the nest of a stapler; the window stayed open to confuse everyone with the cold. Rea smelled plastic and coffee and the faint sweetness of a spilt yoghurt. She smelled the difference, too, but didn’t let herself name that yet. In her mind the word kept itself behind glass: copper.

“Miss Hamish,” said the detective assigned to the scene, a man with a voice he had probably practiced because he didn’t like how it sounded at its natural register. “Head of Art. Thirty-one. Stayed late. Caretaker found her at three. He’s outside having a smoke he thinks we don’t know about.”

“Where’s the camera.” Rea didn’t modulate. She crouched.

“We didn’t touch it.” He pointed. It lay on the table by the laminated Health at Work poster, black tape and the faint scuff of someone’s thumbnail on the body. Around it, years’ worth of mugs and a sugar jar that would not close properly. The strap was frayed.

She looked at the mouth. People always look at the face when they meet you and then none of that matters once they meet you for the last time. The lips were relaxed now, the muscle gone three-quarter slack. She had seen different kinds of mouths in her training. The caught O of an aneurysm, the loose garden gate of sleep, the lips held tight out of habit even after the habit was irrelevant. What struck her in the sudden quiet, in the fluorescent hum that came in like weather, was the film of lipstick still glossy because the warm of the room had not given up until it had to.

She leaned in. Something in the red — not a colour, no, a pattern. Faint. She didn’t bring her face close; she had learned that people mistake proximity for empathy, and right now she needed the cooler view. She put a gloved finger near, pointed without touching. “There is something missing,” she said. “Here. A smear unlike the others. As if a kiss was borrowed and then returned.”

“The photos. The killer took photos,” the detective supplied, his practiced voice cracking like ice over a pond. “Worked over the lips. We found another body last week in Lambeth, English teacher, and a Polaroid in her handbag. The—”

But he stopped because Rea had found the little glint she had been tricked into by the poor light. On the corner of the table, half under a printed email about a PTA raffle, a flake of something that caught and held like fish scale. She slid a business card under it and lifted.

It was nothing much to look at. A translucent crescent like the memory of a nail clipping. In hospital she would have called it detritus. Here, it sat on the card like a promise.

“Glitter?” the detective said, and then felt silly because it wasn’t glitter and because the day was too early for glitter.

“Skin,” Rea said. “Dry skin. Flaking.” She put the card in a paper envelope someone provided without being asked. It felt good to ask for nothing.

“And the cause of—”

“Don’t ask me that,” she said, sharply enough to be rude, politely enough to close a door. “It’s too soon to be certain. I’m here because of the pattern. How many now?”

“Three.” He didn’t look at her. “Teachers. No defensive wounds. In each case, evidence of the subject taking photographs of the victims’ mouths. We found one of the images at the second scene. Just the lips. The first, nothing. The third—” He swallowed. The word third hurt because the word fourth came next, inevitable as weather. “—this.”

Rea went to the whiteboard. Sometimes people write things without knowing they’re writing the most important thing. She looked, not at the PSU meeting reminder but at the little drawing of a goblin with jam. She felt the unprofessional flicker of warmth at the clumsy pun, the office joke leavening an office life that could be so unbearable. She looked at the jam. She looked at the smudges of the caretaker’s fingers on the corner.

“Any witnesses.”

“A neighbour heard something like singing. Might have been the radio. Might have been—”

“Did she sing.”

“Who.”

“The victim.”

“Hamish? The art teacher? She had a karaoke night planned, see the board. But—”

“Not karaoke,” Rea said softly, almost smiling, because there were two kinds of people: the kind who made a song into a shout, and the kind who made a shout into a song. “It’s different.”

She crouched again, and this time she leaned in closer. The smudge. She could see now it was not random, not the way the corner of a mouth breaks when you turn your head to speak. The curve a little too symmetrical. The impression of a lip pressed to lip, a strange rite, the dead kissed after the fact. Except that the residue was wrong and it smelled faintly of something like old pennies and moss.

“Ms. Hamish taught art,” she said. “But the last thing she taught was whoever stood here what it is to be looked at. To be witnessed. Not all teachers are cruel. Make sure that’s in your head when you speak to her mother.”

The detective looked at her, the word mother doing its usual trick of rearranging the gravity in the room.

“Doctor,” he said, because to call her detective would mean admitting he needed something other than industry and good practice. “We pulled your file because of the Crawley incident. I hope that’s not out of line.”

Rea kept her eyes on the mouth on the table. “It would be strange if you hadn’t.”

“You saved a boy’s life. And then you left A&E.”

“Yes.”

“Why.”

“Because there are places where you wait for bad things to come to you, and then there are places where you go and find them. I am better at walking than sitting.” She straightened. “And because I could not stand another three a.m. where I had to tell a mother what she had always known.”

The corridor had light. Morning was smudging the city like thumbprints on glass. Rea moved through it with a focused gait, the kind you learn when you have to remind yourself to put one foot in front of the other. Outside, the caretaker smoked like a man in a cartoon. He looked the wrong way so as not to look at her.

“Was anyone unkind to you here,” she asked him, because she had found over the last year that this question produced better answers than Did you see anything suspicious.

He blinked. “You’re not police.”

“I am. And I am also somebody who believes that all stories start somewhere very small.”

“Kids throw apples sometimes.”

“And to you.”

“I do the bins.”

“Did anyone ever put something in them to make a point.” She could smell onions on him. You could tell a great deal about a man by whether the smell of his food lived in his coat.

He considered. “Last term someone left a pig mask on top. The drama teacher, I think. A joke. I don’t know. Someone made a fuss about it no one should have made that fuss and in the end she took it home to frighten her boyfriend.”

“Who made the fuss.”

“O’Connor. Supply. Heavy on the rules.”

“Is he still here.”

“Nah. He didn’t last. The kids liked him and he liked them and that’s never the way.”

Rea nodded. She thanked him. She went back inside to stand in a room where a new sort of pattern had been drawn over the common one. She thought: mouths. There are people who love mouths. The way they are architecture and music both, the way there are secrets behind them and the way they can be opened or closed like doors in bad weather.

She also thought: Crawley. Because you carry where you’re from in your pockets even after you wash your clothes.

When she signed her name to the evidence list, the pen snagged. She wrote an extra loop and then drew a small line through it. She added Doctor Rea. She did not know why the doctor mattered that morning except that she had woken with the memory of plaster dust under her nails from an old shift where the ceiling had given out under someone’s Christmas decorations, and she wanted to hold in her hand at least one thing that had not fallen through.

By ten, the television vans had arrived like birds. By eleven, the boy with the recorder who had once been a child asked questions he would be ashamed of later. By twelve, the city had rearranged itself around the new hole in it. Things accreted. Statements. Lunch eaten standing up. A brief report that a dog-walker had seen a small figure under the railway bridge which resolved itself into a drainpipe. All the things that do not help you until they suddenly do.

In her car, Rea listened to the radio talk about nothing. She called a number she did not know and listened to a voice say that the person she wished to reach could not be reached and then hung up and called it again, as if repetition could dent the world into a shape she could sit inside.

She drove to her mother’s because skins change with pressure and some days you choose to be a child again. The house in Southgate was exactly itself: an arrangement of chairs facing a television doing its best. Photos of ceremonies where none of the people shown remembered the words spoken. A framed fish made of shells from a granddaughter’s holiday a decade before. Her mother took a long time to open the door and then said, “Why do you look like a detective,” as if this were a joke.

“I am one,” Rea said, letting herself be her mother’s mirror. “Hi Ma.”

Her mother put the kettle on and did not ask whether she wanted tea because the question was considered indelicate: what if the answer were no. “Your father called,” she said, more accusation than news.

“He tends to.” She poured the tea and put the milk in and got exactly right the way her mother liked it by not trying too hard. “I have to ask you something. A silly thing.”

“Then call your friend Arthur. He loves silly things. Was that unkind. I have not slept.”

“Do you remember me in year three. Mrs. Kavanagh.”

Her mother frowned like a person who has learned that frowning gets the job done faster than thinking. “The one with the teeth.”

“She told me to be quiet for a whole day. She said it was a game. What did I do.”

“You were born,” her mother said, with love. “You talked too much. You always talk too much. You think talking will dilate a person’s grief until it becomes manageable.”

“Did she ever say it was a game to anyone else.”

“Everyone,” her mother said, and dipped a biscuit. “She was not cruel, Rea. She was busy. Perhaps she should have had fewer children.”

“Perhaps,” Rea said. She thought of the photographs of lips. She thought of someone somewhere who had been told to use their inside voice and had not known where to find it.

Her phone chimed. The message appeared as a block not long enough to be a paragraph and not short enough to be dismissed as a prank. No number. Just a small square of an image that struggled to resolve over the poor kitchen Wi-Fi. Her mother stood with her hand on the counter, her wedding ring turned so that the stone faced her palm, a habit she had never given up.

The image resolved. Lips. Not Miss Hamish’s. Different. Fuller. A little chapped. With a smudge of cherry chapstick like a child’s sick-day indulgence. The angle was strange. The light was the kind the city makes when too many windows decide to be kind at the same time. Across the lower lip, a fine line of something like ink. A word written very small.

Rea pinched her fingers, not at the image, but at herself. She zoomed. The letters were there, because the person responsible wanted them to be noticed, and also because that person could not help showing off. Two words written in a tidy childish script with a cheap pen: Say less.

“Spam,” her mother said. “It is telling us to buy something.”

“It is,” Rea agreed. She had not told her mother about the cases. She had not told anyone anything she did not have to, and this made her unkind in ways that made her more efficient.

She forwarded the image to her work phone. She responded with a single full stop. The instinct: show you I see you. The restraint: show you nothing.

Her work phone rang one second later, which is how she knew someone clever enough to be scared of knew her number. She answered and said nothing. She heard someone breathing very carefully. The carefulness was more horrifying than any panting would have been. Whoever had this voice had learned once that breathing wrong gave you away, and had never forgiven themselves.

“Hello,” said the voice.

Rea said, because sometimes the simplest tools are sharpest, “Hello.”

“Do you know me.”

“No,” said Rea, and let the lie sit there like a coin on a gravestone. “But I will.”

A small laugh, stifled like a cough in church. “He knew songs,” the voice said. “She told him he knew songs, when everyone else told him not to be so loud.”

“Is that why you chose her.”

“Silly. I didn’t choose her. She arrived. I am a thing that arrivals happen to.”

“What should I call you.”

The voice liked this. She could hear the body of the other person like a hand not quite steady. “Call me Catalina,” the voice said, as if that answered a question no one had asked.

“Is that your name.”

“Yes,” and then, with a small copse of rage hiding in it, “and also no.”

“Where are you.”

“Under,” Catalina said. “Most of the time I am under. Sometimes under bridges. Sometimes under stairs. Once under a pew. I saw so many shoes that year.”

“Where will you be at dusk.”

Silence. A good silence, the kind that furniture makes. “You’re from Crawley,” Catalina said. “You are a doctor. Why do you think this is your business.”

“Because everyone will make it theirs eventually and then it will no longer respond to gentle hands. I prefer to meet things while they still might be listened to.”

Another laugh, drier now. “Doctor Detective. You think this is a good joke.”

“I do,” said Rea. “Tell me your regret.”

The quiet that followed was not the telephone’s fault. “You want to steal it,” Catalina said, somewhere between curious and offended. “I’ve only got the one.”

“I can’t,” Rea said. “We both know that. What I can do is stop you stacking other people’s regrets on it like crockery.”

“Teachers,” Catalina said suddenly, as if remembering her shopping list. “I would pay for them, if anyone would take money for that. I would lay it all down on the table and say keep the change, but there is no cashier, Doctor. Only people being funny about jam.”

The line clicked. Not hung up; not quite. Reduced. The voice did not return. Rea looked at her mother who had been stirring a cup without tea in it this whole time, her finger going around and around, and the spoon left on the counter.

“You are the kind of girl,” her mother said finally, “who brings a wolf home because it was raining.”

“Yes,” said Rea. “I’m sorry.”

“Don’t be sorry,” her mother said. “Bring it in. And when it dries off or remembers itself, send it back to the forest.”

After she left her mother’s, Rea drove without the radio. The road was a ribbon. The light was a judgement. She went back to the station, sat in a room that had been painted white too many times to be forgiving, and gathered notes. Names: the three so far, their families, who had liked them, who had resented them, who had gone out of their way to give them small joy. People underestimate how often joy solves a case.

On the noticeboard, she wrote in a corner because she had earned the right to make small messes. She wrote: Lips. Songs. Inside voices. Under. And then she wrote the name. Catalina. She underlined it once, gently. She did not add goblin. That would come later, in someone else’s mouth, and she would have to lower that mouth into silence.

Arthur Moxon came in without knocking because some relationships can bear that. He had dragged her into this life and had then held the door so it did not slam. His tie was wrong in a way that made people trust him. “You’ve got a look,” he said, sitting down without asking. “The one where you are pretending you had a plan all along.”

“I spoke to her,” Rea said. “She called herself Catalina.”

“Spanish. Or adopted. Or nothing. It’s a good mouth name.”

“She’s obsessed with mouths.”

“She photographs them? The lips?”

“Yes.” Rea breathed. “She told me someone told a boy he could sing.”

Arthur nodded. “Art teacher?”

“Yes.”

“We did a sweep of her house. I’ll show you the footage. There’s a—” he stopped himself. “You’ll want to see.”

He plugged in the drive. He let it spool. He had the grace to turn the volume down. The camera walked through Miss Hamish’s flat. Books like uneven teeth. Duvet in the wrong aisle. Plants trying their best. On the fridge, a list written in a juvenile script: Tell Perrin he can sing. Encourage more singing in Year Four assembly. Try not to let O’Connor go. The way people write when their inner life is the head of a parade.

“She wrote it down,” Rea said. “She made an appointment with kindness.”

“She never got to keep it,” Arthur said. He rubbed his thumb over a stab of headache at his temple. “We found this in the bin.”

He set a small ziplock on the table. Inside, a photograph. The mouth of someone from a different life. Older. Lines that came from either laughter or venom. The lips painted a colour the name of which would probably be something unhelpful like Dust. Across them, in ballpoint pen, someone had written an address. Not a whole address. A street. A bridge. A poem, if you had eaten enough sugar.

“Battersea,” Arthur said. “That’s one bridge.”

“She’s under bridges,” Rea said. “She said she likes under.”

“We all love under. It’s easier to be the bottom than the top. Less weather.”

Rea made a note. She put the photograph beside the image on her phone and saw the handwriting was the same. The long tail on the s, the way the t was crossed as if someone was wiping a stain. She thought of a classroom. She thought of a child copying a date over and over because the teacher was busy.

“Why teachers,” Arthur said, half to himself. “Did she—”

“Don’t say school,” Rea snapped. “Everyone says school as if the word explained the rest. As if school is not a thousand rooms and a hundred lives in each. She is exacting a debt when the cashier is on break.”

Arthur looked at her for a long time, then smiled. “You get lyrical when you’re exhausted.”

“When I was little,” she said, because sometimes you need to tell the least relevant truth to bite the other truths into place, “a woman tied a scarf around my mouth because I was talking on the coach. Nobody noticed. I had to chew myself free. The scarf had bells on. Everyone knew I liked bells and thought I was happy.”

They sat for a while. The hum of the building filled the gaps. Outside, the sky dragged its feet toward evening. Arthur coughed. “We’ll have plainclothes at every bridge we can staff. We’ll send out the teacher list again. We’ll make ourselves useful.”

“She’ll make us feel stupid,” Rea said, and almost, almost smiled. “She’ll do something that looks like theatre that is actually admin. She’s been well trained.”

She went to the ladies and washed her hands even though she had not touched anything. She watched the water carry her tiredness into the basin. She pressed a paper towel to her mouth and remembered being a child holding lipstick to her lips and imagining adulthood as a room where you were allowed to speak at the volume you carried around inside without apologies.

At dusk, the air carried the day’s news like an aftertaste. Rea stood at the edge of the river and watched the city do its river theatre. Buses like fat arteries, boats like thoughts, bridges like a hand someone had put up to stop a story. She knew London as someone from outside knows it: everything together all the time, terrible at choosing what to show you. She loved it the way you love a stranger who unknowingly saves your life just by being there.

Her phone vibrated. A new image. Lips again. This time the blot was larger, as if the hand had trembled. The words wrote themselves on her bones: Second period.

“School,” she said, hating herself.

She sent the image on. She texted Arthur: Check supply rosters near river. Anyone with second period English. She put her phone in her pocket and stepped back because something in the corner of her vision had startled — no, not startled. Announced itself.

A small figure, not a child but not confident enough to be something else, was under the steps leading to the walkway. She saw the sheen of a coat that had been kept alive by many seasons. She saw hair like wet moss and a hand with nails she could not stop herself naming: careful. She saw the camera resting on the person’s chest like a confession.

“Catalina,” she said, as if greeting someone in her waiting room. “I was beginning to think you were another one of the river’s tricks.”

Catalina smiled. It happened on the right side of her face first, as if someone had told her that’s where smiling begins. “Doctor,” she said. “You came to the under.”

“I have always liked it,” Rea said. “It’s quieter. Fewer windows.”

“Windows are made of forgiveness,” Catalina said. “They let you look without being something in the room.”

They stood. People walked by with the tunnel-vision of tiredness. Somewhere a bus decided on a new route and told three people at once. A boy on a bicycle made a noise he would later commit to a song. Rea stayed as still as she could without becoming what she feared Catalina might turn her into: a piece of furniture in a room where the wrong thing had happened.

“Tell me,” Rea said. “Tell me the name of the boy whose song you are trying to have sung.”

Catalina held her camera very gently. “You want me to be crying,” she said. “Everyone wants me to be crying.”

“I want you to tell me one true thing you haven’t told yourself yet. I want to see if it takes.”

“A true thing,” Catalina said thoughtfully. “All right. I am not what they say I am.”

“What do they say you are.”

Catalina lifted her free hand and made the little shape with her fingers kids use when they’re about to tell you something they know you’ll hate. “Goblin girl,” she said, and then, because she liked the way the word tasted, “gobble-in. Greedy. Mean.” She tilted her head. “Did they call you witch.”

“Only when it was time to blame someone for a man’s boredom,” Rea said. “Catalina. You killed three people. You must stop. Come with me and we will make the stopping into a beginning. There are rooms where people will listen to you talk as long as you like, and they will write everything down, and no one will tie bells around your mouth.”

“You promise so easily,” Catalina said, and now there was something like sorrow in her voice. “You would make a very good teacher.”

“I was a very good doctor.”

Catalina took a photo then. Not of Rea. Of the space between them. The flash lit the underside of the bridge and made the chewing gum constellations on the path show their faces. “My regret,” she said, and now the word sounded like a little animal she fed treats to, “is not the thing you think. It is not that I did not sing. It is that I learned who applauds.”

“You can pick a different room,” Rea said. “There are so many rooms. We could go right now to one where someone will say your name without asking where it goes on the form.”

Catalina considered, as if tasting a new food. Then she shook her head. “You will catch me later,” she said. “When the light is good for it. When you can say London Bridge like a poem.”

“It is not a poem,” Rea said. “It is where people cross. It is a thing you survive at least twice a day if you are lucky.”

Catalina smiled. It didn’t reach her eyes because her eyes were busy elsewhere. “Doctor,” she said, almost politely. “You made me want to be the kind of thing people cross. Do you see. I will go now. I have marking to do.”

She slipped sideways into the river of people. She was small in the most obvious ways. She had learned to be. Rea let her go because there are hunts and there are chases and right now she had neither. She pulled her phone out and made a list down the notes app because paper could be stolen; because sometimes the only way to survive is to put a fence around the things you’ve learned:

- Catalina. Likely undernourished. Dry skin flaking. Glitter-like.

- Camera: Nikon tape strap. Habitual.

- Language: teacher, song, inside voice, under. Likes jokes when she thinks they are hers.

- Teachers targeted: kind, loud, or those with lists. Motive: a debt ledger with no cashier.

She added, and did not know why: Do not promise her something you cannot deliver in this life.

Her phone buzzed again. A final image. Lips pressed hard enough to blur. Two words. New teacher.

Rea stood under the bridge and felt the old engine in her chest knock once and then catch. She thought of the job she had left and the one she had taken. She thought of Crawley, flat and functional, and of London, always folding itself and then unfolding like a magician’s hanky. She thought that when she was a girl she had drawn mouths on her hands and made them speak for her because she did not know how to make her own say the right things.

“Second period,” she said aloud, and then she was moving, and the river watched her from the corner of its eye and did not trip her because sometimes even a river understands you are trying to stop someone who does not know how to stop herself.Chapter Three

Rea ran her finger along the edge of the city as if London were a rough piece of cloth she could hem. She talked while she drove, not out of nervousness, but because speech was a tool and sometimes tools must be kept oiled. Arthur stayed on the other end, saying yes and no and mm in the right places, those unheroic syllables that kept partnerships together longer than grand speeches did. She divided the banks and bridges into not just north and south, but what the school timetables looked like there, who started at eight-thirty because parents worked shifts, who started at nine because a headteacher had decided children deserved ten extra minutes to arrive as human beings instead of parcels. “Second period,” she said twice, letting the phrase change its weight by repetition. “Most primaries have literacy first thing, maths second. In secondaries, English likes to sit early. A new teacher would be timetabled where someone could watch them without admitting they were watching.”

Arthur’s type clacked like rain in another room. He read names as if they were medicines, careful to pronounce even the ones he would not be using. There were three new appointments within walking distance of three bridges, all provisional, all suddenly relevant to a woman who owned a camera and spoke as if language had done something personal to her. “Southwark,” he said. “St. Zachary’s has a second period Year Seven with a Miss J. Daines. NQT. Pastoral notes suggest she calls them ‘my loves’ and someone lodged a complaint because their boy is not your love, miss. At Lambeth, St. Wethelburg’s—who names these—has a Mr. K. Banerjee, second period Year Three. ECT. His mentor reports he is too soft. Battersea has an academy no one admits to having created, new English lead covering second period Year Nine because timetable gap.”

“An academy that no one admits to,” Rea said, and she could hear her own fond contempt, the way people fold cynicism into care when they talk about schools. She pictured corridors still smelling of paint and fear, a head with a business card rather than a vocation, a reception desk with a bowl of sweets and a laminated sign about respect. “Which one does she mean by ‘new teacher’.”

“The words want your certainty,” Arthur said, and she loved him a little for refusing to supply it. “Second period gives us time. New teacher gives us a colour to look for in a grey coat.”

Rea parked not where a detective would, which is to say she did not attempt theatre. She left the car two streets down, on a corner where foxes liked to meet and find out who had left out what in whose bin. The academy was scowlingly modern, a stack of light and glass that made you aware you were not part of it. On the fence someone had tied ribbons for something that had happened months ago and never entirely stopped. Through the clean, expensive entrance, she could see a woman explaining a sign-in system with the tiredness of a saint who had found the wrong religion. Rea walked around the building to its back where the old school had been, unaffected by new money and the insistence of philanthropists that steel is kinder than stone. There was a walkway that went under the stairwell to the staffroom, and there were two smokers pretending this was a bad habit they could quit and also a sacrament no one should have to. She stood behind the bin store and watched the doors.

At nine-thirty the building’s pulse altered. The release of first period sent a living current through it: vowel sounds and trainers and the complaint of children whose bodies are not allowed to be what they are larger than the chairs. The second period bell was too polite, the kind of bell that had sat a long time in a committee meeting. She checked her phone without looking like she was checking her phone. A message from Arthur opened and expanded like a cold breath. “We’ve got eyes at Southwark and Lambeth. Banerjee’s class is reading out loud today. Daines has announced ‘sharing circles’, which means she is doing training by stealth. Battersea at risk for being the kind of place that announces itself with enthusiasm and then has no staffroom mugs with handles.”

The new English lead was late. The deputy with sandpaper voice would have called that a character flaw, but the deputies who say things like that are not the ones who last. He appeared finally as a shape you recognize from a distance because the way a person carries a book is a signature. He was careful with his mouth the way careful men are when they have grown up being told they are not careful enough. He was new, and he wore newness like a suit you can’t sit down in. A teaching assistant said something kind to him and did not receive it because kindness is hard to recognise when you expect it to be a trick. Rea checked herself for impatience and found the older version of the feeling: dread shaped into something you can carry.

Catalina had already been in the building. Rea did not know this because of a sudden insight delivered to her by a benevolent narrative. She knew because the cleaner’s cage was unlocked and slightly open with that particular openness of a door that has been closed and then closed again by someone who scans the world slightly to the right of it. Inside, a black coat lay folded with an intimacy that suggested either ownership or worship. On top, a small grocery bag with a lipstick rolling inside it like a marble. Rea felt the prickle along the hinge of her jaw that had saved her life once and got her into trouble twice. She sent Arthur a single word, the kind of message you send when you have learned that writing more makes something less true. “Here.”

Second period began with a reading of poems about migration. The academy had decided to be good at being good this week, and the lesson plans were full of intention. The students read in the particular cadence of the self-conscious, in which every syllable begets its own apology. The new English lead was telling them the thing all English teachers tell children because it is both true and a thing you yourself need to hear when you are a fragile adult in a room of ninety-one per cent judgement. “There are no wrong answers if you can take me to the place you found yours,” he said twice, because the first time the boy at the back thought he was joking. He had the beginning of a cold and was wiping his nose with his hand in a way that told Rea he had spent a childhood in rooms where this was nobody’s problem.

Catalina’s entry was nothing. That was her particular talent. Not the glamour of villains who take credit; not the flourish of those who want to be caught with a flourish. A girl stepped out to the toilet and came back to the wrong room and nobody scolded because she had the face of someone who is often misled by buildings. Catalina blended into that mistake. She wore the high-visibility vest of a visitor, the pass that said Miss P, as if administratively she could abbreviate herself into acceptability. The new teacher saw her, registered her as figure of authority, and did his little good-man nod that said thank you for checking on me. Rea watched the exchange happen as if she were under very clear water and could see the fish deciding where to be.

There was a system in this academy where doors locked themselves and only opened for people whose faces had been given permission. Catalina had learned to keep her head angled to the light to scramble such recognitions. She held a folder that said Pastoral Support so convincingly that Rea believed it from a distance. Catalina’s hair made her into a thought about damp walls and moss, and in this building that particular seep did not exist; its problem was the absence of old things, not their persistence. She took a seat at the back of the classroom and wrote a note on the observation template she had stolen. “NQT,” she wrote, “establishes tone through smile not specificity, however children respond to cadence.” She made a small doodle of a goblin in the corner and then crossed it out because the joke was for her, not this room.

The lesson moved. The poem was by someone who had written it on a bus and then forgotten, which is to say it had been loved by teenagers. A boy who had learned not to raise his hand because the world was quicker than his wrists said something magnificent about tides. The new teacher rewarded him with a whole-body thank-you, the kind you give when you have been starved of conversations where the point is discovery. Catalina listened with the hollowy attention of a person who hopes to collect the sound of such moments on her own tongue. She was already making the second list in her pocket: new names, small sentences, the ledger of kindnesses she would prefer to owe.

Rea gave herself permission to enter. She could not hide in the corridor without becoming the corridor, and she had promised herself she would not be the furniture of her own life. She stepped into the room at the precise moment that made three children look up and miss that the rest did not. The new teacher’s smile changed from reflective to defensive. Catalina’s eyes flickered to the camera strap beneath her vest and then back to the poem. The teaching assistant, who had seen the world throw up more difficult puzzles than this, handed Rea a visitor badge because the universe runs on people like that.

“Observation,” Rea said, and let her lanyard flash and not lie. She stood at the side of the room and watched. She listened to the children taste the word estuary and say it like it contained a small amount of sugar. She watched the way Catalina hovered, how her body arranged itself as a spectator might who intends to step into the wings. Catalina’s nails tapped the folder in a rhythm that did not match the poem, which was how Rea knew she was counting something else entirely.

It was the sound that gave it away, the smallest of sounds, because Catalina was good and had learned to be better at being good than the good people were. As the new teacher leaned over a desk to praise a paragraph, there was the soft reek of a cap being eased off a tube, not the high hiss of an aerosol, no, the little breath a cheap pen makes when you uncap it after chewing. Catalina’s hand moved as if to annotate, and Rea remembered the smear on Miss Hamish’s lip, the neatness of the writing on the kiss. She saw Catalina’s pen, the child’s pen with the cartoon that had been rubbed away by other uses, and she moved while still looking like she was not moving, because the trick of saving a life is often to behave as if your body is no more remarkable than any other thing in the room.

She knocked a chair with her knee so it made a sound to cover the sound Catalina’s pen had made, and three children laughed because adults being clumsy are trustworthy. “Sorry,” she said aloud, and moved between Catalina and the new teacher with a casualness that almost killed her, because it meant she could not gather herself into any kind of brace. She looked the new teacher in the eye the way she had looked strangers in A&E when there were knives being held by hands that had failed other classes, and she said, “Could I borrow you for two?” in a tone that filled in the paperwork and signed it.

He blinked, did the little shoulder twitch of a person deciding to trust, and followed her into the corridor. “What’s—” he began, and then because perhaps the world had kept him alive so far, he closed his mouth and waited.

“There is a woman in your classroom who is not your colleague,” Rea said, and even now she found a way not to frighten him. “She is very good at looking as if she is meant to be where she is. You are going to finish your poem. You are going to tell a child named—” she told him the first name she had caught earlier, in this case the boy who had spoken about tides “—that he has a point you’d like to hear again at the end. Then you’ll step aside and let the assistant do the third question. You will ignore any instruction from the visitor that begins with ‘let me help’. Do you understand.”

He looked younger than he had looked moments ago, which is often what understanding removes from you. He nodded and glanced at the room through the salon hair of the small window. He had the sense to ask, “And you,” because this is also what good men do when they are not sure they are allowed to be saved.

“I am going to stand in a place that means she has to move past me to leave,” Rea said, and did not add that sometimes being a doctor confused your reflexes in unhelpful ways; you step into doors that close behind you, because that is how theatres work and because some of us never recovered from our first backstage pass.

She let him go in. She smiled at a poster that insisted excellence was a habit, like flossing. She counted along with Catalina’s tiny taps, three, five, seven, as if those numbers meant that anything in the world could be divided into useful quantities.

Catalina had understood the choreography. She was not stupid and did not even like the people who assumed she was. She backed away from the desk, made a small show of writing a note, and then moved past the teaching assistant, who stiffened like a good oak tree, bless her, and past the two boys who had built a small fort out of worksheets and then called it “the office” because office is what boys call forts when they are ten and trying on adulthood for the first time. When she reached the door, Rea stepped in, not aggressively, but as if they had been on a train and she had decided to change seats to be companionable. “Miss,” Rea said, as if she were helping a parent find the secondary phase office. “Could you wait a second. There’s an issue with the copier. They need you.”

“The copier,” Catalina said, and her smile was for once a natural thing, because printers and their temperaments were common ground and she enjoyed common ground when it could be used to bury things.

Rea did not touch her. She never touched unless touch was the last tool left. She leaned just enough that Catalina could smell the kind of soap Rea used and understand that this was a person who did small things consistently. “Catalina,” she said, softly enough that the name would feel like a coin slipped, not a bill demanded. “Don’t do this in front of children.”

For a moment the world bent around the single word Catalina in such a way that two people could stand in a doorway and a class could continue on behind them and the bell could not ring because bells do not ring when language is doing this. Catalina did not flinch at the sound of herself. She let the syllables move through her face. “Doctor,” she said, as if they were in a novel of manners and had met again in a conservatory.

“You’ve got ink on your fingers,” Rea said, and because she was still a doctor in her bones, she placed herself so that if Catalina moved quickly, she would be the first thing Catalina would have to negotiate and the last thing she would push past before a corridor full of cameras that could not decide whether they loved her.

Catalina showed her hand like a performer showing there had been nothing up the sleeve all along. The ink was the cheap kind that pretends to be waterproof and is a liar. “I was going to congratulate him,” she said, because lies spoken with an intention identical to the truth are the sweetest. “He has a mouth that says the right shape first time.”

“You can tell him later,” Rea said, and knew how to hollow the word later out so it did not look like never. “Come with me. Come be new at something that won’t put me in touch with your victims’ families before noon.”

Catalina tilted her head, and the moss of her hair darkened in the way damp makes things more vivid instead of less. “You say families as if their togetherness were their fault,” she said, and sometimes Catalina’s ideas were pretty enough to hide the cruelty in them. “Doctor. This isn’t the place. You’re right. I won’t do it here. I am not what they say I am.” She turned her face so the children could not see her mouth when she formed the words they had impossibly already heard earlier in their lives and would now hear under different lights. “Goblin.”

“You are not,” Rea said immediately, because certain lies are medicine if you say them while standing very straight. “People get tired and put their fear into an easy shape and it stays. Let me write you a different shape.”

Catalina looked over Rea’s shoulder at the board, where someone had done their best to draw an estuary. The chalky river went into the chalky sea and there was an arrow that read fresh and another that read salt and the small mouth of the chalk imagined they got along. “He will tell his mother,” she said, indicate the boy with tide thoughts with the lightest lift of the chin, “that a woman stood in the door and saved his teacher and then his mother will take off her shoes and stand in the kitchen and wonder whether to tell anyone that maybe it wasn’t that. Maybe the woman in the doorway saved herself. Will you let her have that.”

“Yes,” Rea said, and found that somewhere along her ribs a set of bells had stopped ringing. “I will let her have that. I will take the rest, if you’ll let me.”

Catalina stepped back. She rotated so the lanyard flipped obediently. “No,” she said, without anger. “Not today. Your friends are at the other bridges, yes. They will look into faces and see their own. It is a good day for it. I promised someone I would return something I borrowed. I’m very polite that way.”

Rea knew there were rules about what she should do next, and she knew also that women like her often end up punished, if not by the law then by the part of themselves that thinks they are the law. She raised her hand as if to touch Catalina’s sleeve without moving far enough to make it useful. “Come and let a woman who ties her hair back when she’s thinking listen to you. Come and let me put your list on a table and decide which names we can cross off by consent and which by effort.”

“He told me to say less,” Catalina said, and for the first time Rea saw something like an older person behind the moss hair, not older in years but older like a house no one goes into anymore. “I tried. It made the inside louder.”

In the room, the tide boy described what happens when rivers meet seas in school language so accurate and bright Rea wanted to put it in her pocket. Catalina stepped sideways and this time there was a gap where Rea was not, because she had made it, because sometimes you have to show someone you will not turn their life into a corner. “Later,” Catalina repeated, and she pulled the visitor vest off in one smooth movement as she went down the corridor, giving herself back the shadow she wore like a good dress when she wasn’t being watched.

Arthur’s voice arrived in Rea’s ear the way weather sometimes arrives: unavoidable, not impolite. “Lambeth quiet, Southwark had a fire drill no one admits to planning. What did you just not do.”

“She left,” Rea said, and she let her back touch the corridor wall only after the classroom door clicked shut. “I asked badly. Or perhaps I asked well and it meant I must wait. Either way, she did not make a theatre of their second period.”

“She’ll make one of someone else’s third,” Arthur said. He exhaled through his nose, which was the polite version of swearing. “We pulled body cam from a cleaner at the academy. She went in through the bins. We’ll never be as clever as trash. The new teacher’s safe today. We’re papering bridges. We’ll look undeservedly busy.”

Rea went back into the classroom to ask the children whether anyone could tell her what the line about “home being a boat made of words” made them think of, and three hands went up, and the boy with the tide thoughts explained the sense of brace when you do not resettle exactly as you left, and the girl with the hair the teachers feared because sometimes they feared girls’ hair explained that home is sometimes the point you pass through on the way to being kinder to yourself. The teaching assistant wrote “to be kinder” on the board and underlined it twice because she had become a teacher without being paid for it.

The bell released them. It did not thank anyone because bells never do that. The new teacher shook as if he had held a plank for longer than he had planned to. He let the children go and sat down and put his head on his hands in a gesture so naked Rea looked away. “I used to be a doctor,” she said after a moment, because certain confessions make rooms warmer. “I did night shifts and thought that meant I was in the business of darkness. A woman came in once with an injury she had given herself just so she could leave a place. She told me she had not eaten jam since she was seven because somebody told her jam was for the weekend. What I want to say is you are doing your job. And I would recommend jam on a Tuesday sometimes.”

He laughed in that watery way good men laugh when they are being offered permission by a stranger. “I’m Kian,” he said, because naming things is also how we thank people. “I don’t know what I’m doing. I thought I did, and then it started and all the knowledge I had turned into brochures.”

“You kept your mouth gentle when it counted,” Rea said, and now she could look him directly. “You changed your tone without making it someone else’s fault. There will be a day when the printer eats all your paper and a leadership person tells you the phrase ‘data miracle’, and on that day you can call someone and I will be that person if no one else is.”

He nodded with a gratefulness that was not embarrassing because there were no children left to watch him do it. “Who was she,” he asked, with the casualness of a man who knows he is stepping into a pool and wants to know whether the water is cold or just shocking.

“Catalina,” Rea answered, and the syllables put a mark on the room as if they had been written in weak tea. “She takes photographs of mouths because she is trying to return something she thinks was stolen from her before she had a way of naming property. She will look like a shadow even under fluorescent light. She will be kinder than you want her to be the moment before she kills you. Don’t be brave. Be quick. Be boring. Boring has saved more lives than courage.”

In the corridor, a girl dropped her tote bag and five hundred pens came out like currency. Rea helped her pick them up, handed them back without counting, and stepped into the stairwell that smelled of heating and adolescence. The day outside had arranged itself into that metallic cold the city likes to pretend is new every winter. She thought of the word under again and for a moment let herself be angry at the way cities give that word so many opportunities. Bridges, stairs, bleachers, tables, rules. If she had believed in gods she might have accused one of architecture.

Her phone buzzed. Arthur, without preface, said, “We found the lipstick brand. Not that it will help. It’s the one the pound shop puts near the till. There’s a smell to it, cheap cherries and old pennies. Forensic says the flake you found is consistent with someone using a steroid cream badly. Eczema or a relative. It leaves a glitter if you move in certain lights.”

“Make a note of pharmacies near the bridges,” Rea said, and she could hear her mother chide her for confusing kind with useful. “She’ll buy where she thinks no one would have looked at her even if she had asked them to. Ask for staff who talk to the small, not the loud. Ask who is always buying plasters and not enough food. She is not starving. That is a different person. But she is a person who eats in the wrong order.”

“And the phrase,” Arthur said. “Say less. It feels like something we’d have put on a mug for someone we barely know. It’s an instruction that makes the mouth an enemy. She’s telling us the task she set for herself and failing at it beautifully.”

Rea crossed the road and a bus made way for her, which she accepted as a small miracle the universe could afford. “Banerjee at Lambeth,” she said, because her brain liked to hold two tracks at once. “If he is too soft, someone has been unkind to him for it already. Check whether anyone asked him to cut back on stories. The ones who begged stories from someone when they were small punish them for telling them later. It feels personal and it is not personal, which is the most confusing kind of harm.”

She met Arthur at the bottom of a set of steps that led into the kind of cafe that calls itself a canteen. He handed her tea that had seen a tea bag, which was all any drink could promise on a day like that. On the table between them, he spread the photos again with the care of a man laying out a set of instruments. Lips, lips, lips. Painted, chapped, wiped, kissed after death by a person who thought returning a thing was a moral in itself. He pointed at the ballpoint words on two of them. “Say less,” he repeated. “Second period.” He waited, because talking in Rea’s vicinity sometimes meant you got outpaced.

“She is trying to organise her own acts into a lesson plan,” Rea said. “She is writing the concept on the board. She thinks if she arranges the terms the children in the room will grasp it. The first, an instruction she has received more times than is survivable. The second, a timetable unit, an architecture she can control if she occupies it. She gave us ‘new teacher’ because she thinks the only people who ever truly listened to her were new, and then they grew old in the wrong ways.”

Arthur nodded the way people do when something obvious is said in a voice that makes the obvious new. He reached into his pocket and pulled out something that had not been a plan. “This was at the Southwark site,” he said. “It fell out of a wound drawer. Don’t ask me why I opened it. It was stuck and that is all the reason any man needs.” He placed a badge in front of her, the cheap kind you print yourself and then cut wrong. It said PASTORAL in a font that thought trustworthiness could be bought. The name beneath was Miss Penny.

“Miss P,” Rea said, and the relief she felt was not because the world had gotten smaller but because it had gotten precise enough to be held. “She will have other badges. She will have a different name for every part of the building except the parts where she is seen by herself.”

Arthur sipped. The tea was terrible and did the work anyway. “We could go hard,” he said, because good men say things like that as a test of whether you’d like them to be the kind of person who ever says go hard. “Flood the river with uniforms. Announce safer schools and get a minister to stand near a bridge and pretend to love the smell of algae.”

“Do it,” Rea said, “and also don’t think it will help. She is not a force you gallop at. She is an understory. We have to make every under she likes occupied. We have to ask caretakers to sit on their mops and sing. We have to watch for a woman who wants to stand where the light from the microwave makes her smaller in reflection.”

He smiled without joy and rubbed a finger over his brow as if to erase it and start again. “We could do with you sleeping.”

“I slept,” she said, and then the memory of being a child and chewing a bell off a scarf came back so hard she pressed her fingers to her lips. “I slept next to a word I should not have tried to keep alive. That counts.”

Afternoon drew itself thin. The thing about cities is that they get tired differently to us. They don’t slump; they shimmer. Rea stood under one of the bridges she had decided not to call anything romantic and watched the water pretend to hurry. The cold crept up through her soles because boots do not actually protect you from anything you feel in your bones. Across the way a teacher who had decided not to cry on public transport forced herself to find something at the edge of the river to adore, even for a second. A man who had been rehearsing his resignation letter for three decades stood stock-still and told himself he was only looking at ducks.

Her phone buzzed again and she took a breath that looked like she was indulging a bad habit. The image loaded slower this time, as if the city itself were reluctant. Lips, but not complete this time. The edge of a mouth, the beginning of a smile, the hint of a freckle that would help later. The words written across it were untidy now, written in a hurry or on a moving surface. “Homework.”

Rea read the word and found herself almost laughing, because cruelty prefers formal structures. She sent Arthur a string of instructions like beads: check schools that still use paper plag-sheets for homework; check email systems with attachments that do not attach; find which headteacher has recently changed the policy on punitive homework because Ofsted said a thing in a report. She added: ask the pupil champions at the south academy what they think homework is for. If they say “to make sure we don’t run wild,” put eyes on their teachers.

Catalina, somewhere under something, chose her next doorway. The city provided and the city absolved and the city punished with equal efficiency. Rea knew there would come a point where the morsels of mercy Catalina dropped—a postponed kiss here, an observation about under there—would become neither evidence nor hope, simply glitter in poor light. There is a point in a case where everything is glue. You learn to stop touching it and wait for the air.

She stood with her back against cold brick and made herself one promise. She would not let anyone call the woman by the names people give to women who do what men have always done as if discovery were invention. She would not allow “monster,” except when Catalina spoke it in the way she spoke all her words, as old teeth speaking. She would find a room where Catalina’s list could be turned into a form and that form could be filed and that file could be read by someone who would never in their life tie bells to any child, and if such a room did not exist, then she would construct it in the way women have always constructed such rooms, by clearing a table and putting down a plate and saying sit and begin.

The river went on with its business. A cyclist sang two bars of a pop song and stopped as if scolded by a mother only he could see. Under the next bridge, a man arranged his sleeping space as if he were setting a stage for a matinee that sometimes sold out. The light thinned further. Her phone, again. Not a picture this time, but the first text she had been sent by Catalina to rely on only words. “Meet me where the goblin is funny,” it said, and beneath that: “Bring a teacher who doesn’t know if she is one.”

Rea thought of the doodle on the whiteboard. She thought of jam and jokes that soften rooms that might otherwise crack. She thought of Miss Hamish listing kindnesses like groceries, and of the phrase inside voices, and of the fact that sometimes the shortest route to a hunter is to offer her an honest companion. She dialled a number she had made a note of that morning in a small act of disobedience against the rule never to blur roles. Kian answered on the second ring, his hello tinged with the astonishment of men who have not yet learned that over the course of a long life, often the person who phones you is the person you most need to be on the other end of the line for. “I’m not a teacher yet,” he said, before she had spoken, and Rea smiled because sometimes the world does write your cues.

“You are precisely what she asked for,” Rea said, with the calm that comes when a pattern reveals itself unwillingly. “Bring your coat. Bring the poem they liked. Bring a jam sandwich if you have it in you to be defiant. And if at any point it feels like theatre, bow out and let me do the matinee alone.”

He hesitated in a million tiny ways and then performed the miracle of agreeing. She told him the place. She did not say the word goblin out loud because magic is a delicate thing when children have already been harmed by it.

Twilight found them at the primary in Lambeth where the office still had paper hearts left from February, faded and stubborn. On the whiteboard in the staffroom, someone had drawn the same goblin with the same jam joke that had made Rea warmer than she deserved to be. A caretaker was fixing a hinge and whistling a tune that had been taught to him by a woman who didn’t love him. Rea put Kian by the kettle and told him to pour very slowly. The under appeared not as a shadow this time but as a boredom. Catalina melted out of the shape of a plotting cupboard as if she had been there since Tuesday. The camera was around her neck, and it made her smaller, not bigger.

“You came,” she said, and for the first time she sounded less like she was in church and more like she was by a fire she had not built. “You brought a teacher who does not know yet the way children must be spoken to in order for them to answer you with their real mouths.”

“You asked,” Rea said, and moved so that the space between them belonged to none of them. “We can talk about the rules you have written for yourself. We can talk about what happens in your body when someone tells a boy he can sing. We can talk about the time between second period and lunch when everyone’s sugar is not where it should be. But if you have come here to take, I will not let you.”

Catalina looked at the doodle, at the goblin with jam, and she smiled in spite of herself because the joke was not good and that was the point. “They called me greedy,” she said, and her voice contained the school hall, the polished wood, the smell of butter the PTA had put on three hundred triangles of bread. “Greedy for language. Gobbling the chance to speak. It was funny until it wasn’t. There was a day a headteacher told me he would pay me one pound if I could keep quiet all of lunch. I lasted thirteen minutes. I am here because someone gave me a coin that day and I put it between my teeth, and I have been biting down ever since.”

Kian moved in a way that suggested he had forgotten his own body and had just remembered it. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said, and it was not gallant; it was true. “Sometimes I tell a boy to lower his voice because I cannot bear the noise and then I hear my own teacher telling my friend to lower his voice because he couldn’t bear being alive, and I wish I had not said anything. I make so many small wrong noises. I want to make better ones.” He held out the poem in the shake of his hand. “We read this. It’s not good, but they thought it was. I thought that was something.”

Catalina’s face went through identical expressions in the space of a long blink. She took in the teacher who did not know himself, and the doctor who did, and the goblin with the jam that had been left under a fluorescent light too bright for it. She walked to the board and, with the same cheap pen with which she wrote on lips, wrote a sentence where the meeting notes should have been. “Talking is not a sin,” she wrote, slowly, like she was letting the words learn themselves. “Taking a mouth is.”

She turned. Rea watched the way she kept her shoulder nearest the exit loose and told herself the truth: this would not be the day. It would be almost the day, and then the day would break in the wrong place. Catalina lifted the camera and gestured toward Kian in the small question movement that asks to take a thing and also asks to give it back.

“No,” Rea said, and she did not attach any kindness to it. “No photographs. Not of the living. Not of the dead. Not of the space between. Sit. Have tea. Say more than you have allowed yourself.”

Catalina stood for a long time. The kettle finished boiling and clicked, and Kian poured the water very slowly as if time could be martialled into increments that would end with everyone going home. Catalina’s hand hovered over the tea bag the way a thief’s hand hovers over a wallet he has decided not to steal. She sat down finally and placed the camera on the table like a person placing an animal she did not trust to sleep. “My list is short,” she said, and her voice did not wobble, because wobble is theatrical and she was done with theatre. “It is not the one you think. It is not the people who told me to use my inside voice. It is the ones who told me to lend it.”

“Then you owe less than you think,” Rea said, and she felt a courage that had nothing to do with running toward fires and everything to do with letting them burn out in front of you. “Start there. Tell him what you would have wanted someone to put on his fridge for him to do in the morning.”

Catalina took the pen again. She wrote very small in the corner of the whiteboard where only people who clean the room ever look. “Tell Perrin he can sing,” she wrote, and there were two errors in the way she formed the r that made Rea’s throat do its own private act of grief. “Encourage more singing in Year Four assembly. Try not to let O’Connor go.” She put the pen down and stood up so abruptly the chair made a sound. “I have to do something,” she said, and her smile was a broken thing that let light through.

Rea stopped herself from attempting touch. “Not today,” she said, and the words had grown heavy with her by now. “You have already done something by not doing something. That counts.”

Catalina’s camera strap rasped across her collarbone. She slid to the door, turned her face to avoid the light, and left in the way she enters, by becoming a version of the building it would not question. Kian exhaled, and one of the paper hearts on the noticeboard fell with that peculiar eloquence paper has when it remembers it is not meant to be vertical.

“She’ll go,” Kian said stupidly, because that is what humans do under fluorescent lights. “She’ll just go.”

“She’ll go,” Rea agreed, and gathered the sentence Catalina had left on the board as if it were a piece of evidence that could be pinned easily. “And she’ll arrive somewhere else. But next time she will arrive having sat down for tea, and next time, perhaps, we will get the chair far enough out for her to choose a different table.”

Arthur texted that the minister had indeed stood near algae and had kept his trousers clean, and also that a pharmacy on the south side had reported a woman who bought three different steroid creams and said she was comparison shopping, which is not a thing anyone with eczema ever says. Rea sent back a thank you that sounded like a scolding to anyone who did not know her, and put her phone away and let her body lean into a chair just enough to make it creak, so the room would know someone was in it who would make human noises without apologising.

In the late light, which makes everything seem like the last of something, she rubbed her fingers together and caught a flake of the cheap pen’s blackening, that glitter that wasn’t and was. She felt the old knowledge settle like dust: that you cannot fix the world you are inside of; you can only stop it enlarging its cruelties by naming them very precisely and then not adding to the list. She put the pen into an evidence bag because sometimes symbolism and procedure can live together on the same shelf.

Outside, under sky that will always be bigger than anyone can carry, the city prepared its evening. People who did not know about goblins or jam or the way a camera makes a person think they have a mouth began their walks home. Under the bridge, in the under that nourished her as if it were a root, Catalina counted to thirteen and bit down on the coin she still held under her tongue because the world had been crowded with bells for too long and everything else was starting to sound like forgiveness.Chapter Five

The morning arrived at her window as a paler version of itself, the kind of light that pretends to confess and then asks you to do the confessing. Rea had not entirely slept, but she had done the thing resembling sleep that the body offers when it intends to be forgiven later. The box by the door still read Not Now in her own hand, and she touched the lid as she went past, the same way you tap a friend’s shoulder without needing them to turn. The kettle took its time. The radio muttered about weather and one economist’s certainty. She let both run untreated in the air and sat at the table with three files and a list that had acquired the softness of being folded too many times.

Homework had come the day before like a switch flicked in the dark that illuminated nothing useful. After the staffroom tea, after Catalina had written Talking is not a sin and then left with all the authority of someone stepping out of a room with their own name in their mouth, there had been a silence. The kind that was either grace or a stretched elastic. At two that morning, a secondary thread of the case had tightened: a receptionist at a different school left a voicemail so formal it could only have been fear dressed as competence. A man had been standing in the foyer when the last parents left a meeting about targets; he had not spoken; he had watched the children’s mouths as they gave each other sweets. He had introduced himself as Pastoral. He had asked to borrow the megaphone for assembly. He had not taken it. He had waited under the stairs until he was told they were closing and then had thanked the carpet for listening.

Arthur had called her a few minutes after that, as if his bones and hers had set their watches to each other a long time back and then forgotten to undo the habit. “Either she’s sleeping or she’s making a promise she intends to keep later,” he said. “We’ve primed the caretakers. You were right. They’ll sing where we ask them to. It’s the first time anyone’s asked them to do something that doesn’t involve lifting.”

“Give them something better than a sandwich,” Rea said. “Put their names on a board where a child can see them. The children already know who keeps the building up. The parents don’t.”

“You really did become a detective,” Arthur said, in the soft tone you use when registering a miracle as if it were a mislaid object found safely in a drawer. “Try and do three nice things before ten. Adults suffer the illusion that good deeds are better after lunch.”

She set her nice things in motion without ceremony. She emailed Kian links to two free poems that had saved her from dreadful work the last time she had been expected to be effortless in front of children. She wrote to a head of year she had once spoken to at a training day, asking whether any child named Perrin could be accounted for in any known databases; she made it the least alarming version of a question it is possible to ask about a boy who had once been told he could sing. She texted her mother to say that the kettle’s whistle had finally broken and to ask for a recommendation, which was the way her mother preferred to be asked to participate in Rea’s life: formality around a spoonful of intimacy.

There is an energy that arrives when a case stops being a set of events and begins to be a place you can stand. It is not exhilaration. It is not hope. It is the kind of balance you achieve on a boat when you decide to hand yourself to the water and let it do the arithmetic. At eight-fifteen she was at a print shop that sold everything that tried too hard to be permanent: banners, memorial leaflets, business cards that would live in drawers. The man behind the counter had a face that had been practicing being kind for years and had only been paid for it twice. She held up the badge Arthur had found, the PASTORAL with its trustworthy font, and said, “Did you cut this.”

“Everyone cuts those,” he said, but he took the plastic in a way that suggested he would be nicer to it than it deserved. He turned it over. “I’ve done this exact clip. And I know the type, because you have to buy it in bulk and everyone hates doing that. The laminate’s old. That’s a genuine mistake on the left edge. We had a blade go. My apprentice nicked his thumb on it and bled on a batch of Haribo raffle signs.”

Rea surprised herself by smiling. “If I gave you three dates and three postcodes, could you tell me whether any badges were sold within a week on either side.”

He looked at her with the particular suspicion of men who have loved the wrong women and been made to feel silly for it. “That’s not data I’ve got lined up in a proud pile. But I can look. It’ll take me hours I’m not paid for.”

“I can pay you,” she said.

He shrugged like a champion. “What I meant is, it’s long and boring. You’re asking me to spend my morning in the under of my trade. That’s where I live anyway. Sit. The coffee’s only an insult if you grew up posh.”

She sat. He made coffee that tasted faintly of melted plastic lids. He typed. He called two other men, one of whom said “what’s it worth” and one of whom said “I’ve been waiting for someone to notice, to be honest,” because guilt lives in odd pockets. By nine-thirty they had a scatter of receipts that did not make a pattern until they were placed on a map of London. The badges had been purchased near bridges. The names used were a small stage show: Miss Park, Mr Penny, Ms Penn, Ms P. The email addresses were the sort you invent when dignity has already left the room: iamlatenotlazy@ provider, clickhere@ mail, and once, hilariously and therefore terribly, guidance@ aol. Rea wrote the addresses next to the bridge names and understood that Catalina had not been trying to be clever. She had been trying to be seen. A person who steals a megaphone and then politely returns it does not want to amplify herself. She wants someone to hand her the script where her lines have not been written in by a teacher in red.

“Thank you,” Rea told the print man. She wrote his name down in her notebook because she had learned not to let generosity pass through you unrecorded; it makes you worse at noticing later. He shrugged in that same champion way. “You’re going to do the thing you always do,” he said. “You’re going to protect people who won’t know they were protected and therefore will get angry about something else. Try and eat something not wrapped.”

The pharmacy work came in during her walk back to the car. The flake of skin she had lifted on a business card answered its own small question. Three branches within a mile of water had reported a woman who bought steroid creams two at a time and asked where the cheap cherry lipsticks were because she liked the smell; one pharmacist had refused her second tube because you’re not supposed to, and afterward the woman had stood under the security mirror and practiced saying I understand in a voice that made the staff wish they were nicer people. Rea asked for the footage and for a description, and what came back was a prayer in facts that were not quite facts: small, moss hair, coat like a parable, careful, shoulders that might capitulate under kindness and have not yet had the opportunity.

Arthur met her for ten minutes in a church car park because he liked to make God do double duty for once. He had crisp packets in his pocket. He had news in his eyes that did not know whether it intended to be helpful. “There was a report from a hostel near Vauxhall,” he said, opening the crisps and offering her the bag as if it were absolution. “A woman who books a bed for one night and then puts the key in a library book and leaves it on the shelf. She doesn’t stay. She wanted the option to be staying. The receptionist is a version of God even more tired than the one whose building this is. He says she always puts the key in the same book.”

“Which book,” Rea asked, and chewed a crisp that tasted formally of salt.

“Voice Exercises for Actors,” he said. “The 1977 edition. The librarian’s underlining could be a small thesis about the British relationship to breath.”

Rea pictured the library with its hum and its particular light that was the colour of floor cleaner and mercy. “She wants under that does not smell of algae,” she said. “She wants under where the tables are real wood and someone has thought about how high a chair should be for a child who wishes to become a person someday. We can wait there and capture a woman who will not arrive. Or we can go and find out whether the key has a number burned into it that looks like a date. Both are useful and neither is sufficient.”

“Do you ever stop being poetic,” Arthur asked, and then ruined his complaint by sounding fond.

“When I try, my back hurts,” Rea said. She folded the crisp bag as a small private service to the idea that waste deserves its rituals too. “O’Connor.”

Arthur followed her speed like he always had, letting her miss one step out of every five and catching her on the next. “We’ve got him,” he said. “Supply. Likes kids, something wrong with the adults. He’s got a hip that fell apart and a car that won’t. He told Perrin he could sing, if he was the same O’Connor as the one on the fridge list. He says he once wrote that on ten report cards in one afternoon just to see whether the world would tilt.”

“Bring him to me,” Rea said. “Bring him to a place where there is bad tea and a plug that doesn’t work and a window that looks onto a car park. He’ll understand the set. Tell him to bring the pig mask if he still has it. I am not joking. It will be better if the room can laugh once.”

O’Connor arrived with the weather glued to him. He had the way of moving that supply teachers get after years of assuming a door will be locked when it should be open, and the reverse. His hip made a noise that he attempted to pass off as the chair. He placed a plastic bag on the table with the formality of an altar boy and took out the pig mask. It had been made with a child’s hands, but those hands had not been attached to a child who wanted to be precious. It had teeth. It had a speech bubble glued to one ear that said 5-a-day in the worst handwriting Rea had seen that week. O’Connor looked at her with the pre-emptive apology of men who have been told off for wanting to save people they are not paid to save. “I get attached to the wrong things,” he said. “I get attached to children who will find better teachers than me and to masks that make no room feel serious enough for a harm to happen in it. I told a boy he could sing once and I think the room stood differently for a second. Either this is a story I tell myself so I don’t have to hate the week, or it is the beginning of a road I forgot to stay on.”

“You told him,” Rea said. “Miss Hamish wrote it down later. She was going to make it an appointment. That is two adults in one boy’s week telling him his mouth was an instrument, not a problem. That’s a cultural event, Mr. O’Connor, not a coincidence.”

He barked a small laugh that made room for sorrow to sit down. “I got written up for being too familiar,” he said. “A parent said I called their boy ‘my love’ and they pay rent with words like that. It’s fair. I should have stopped myself one before. My head said I was a distraction. This boy, Perrin, he had a way of letting his desire to sing win arguments. Lots of kids do. I liked it. That was my crime: liking it.”

Rea wrote the name again in her notebook. Perrin. She would write it until her wrist knew it and not just her mind. “We need to find him,” she said. “Not because being told you can sing puts you in danger but because someone thinks the moment she witnessed between you and that boy is a kind of church. She is building an altar in staffrooms. She is placing mouths on it like offerings. It is her way of paying for something that didn’t cost that much in the first place, and if we can find Perrin and let him speak, it might put the price back where it belongs.”

“You could have been a poet,” he said, and then made the face of a man aware that poets don’t pay rent with that.

“I tried,” Rea said. “It had too many meetings and not enough blood.”

They found Perrin with less drama than Rea had prepared for and more consequence. He was taller than the boy in the image she had created for him because of course he was. The people our memories ask to remain small always refuse. He was at a sixth-form college with a music room that had been thickened by students’ breath for decades. He wore his hair like a stash of optimism. He looked at Rea and O’Connor with a guardedness that suggested he had learned about social workers from internet jokes and was now adjusting to the fact that sometimes they looked like exhausted women carrying notebooks and sometimes like men carrying pig masks in carrier bags.

“You told me I could sing,” he said to O’Connor after the introductions had been arranged in the easiest possible order.

“You could and you can,” O’Connor said, and then swallowed because sometimes truth makes your throat sting. “I’m sorry if that made anything worse.”

“It made me taller,” Perrin said, and the words were delivered with the economy of a boy who does not want to embarrass anyone. “I got in trouble for it in French because I sang the verb endings. Madame said I was mocking. I just have a mouth that likes to be full. There was a woman,” he added, and his eyes flicked toward Rea because he understood she was a person who collected relevant nouns and verbs and pressed them into envelopes. “She was at our school last year. She took photos of people’s lips. She said she was doing photography for the newsletter. I didn’t make it into any newsletter. My girlfriend said she looked like a wet November. She smelled like old money. She said she liked the shape my words made.”

“Did she touch you,” Rea asked, not with suspicion but with the question’s own exhausted courtesy. She had said that question too many times in rooms where the kettle was loud. She did not inflect it.

“No,” he said. “She touched Mr. Dreamer. That’s not his name. The drama man. She drew a line on his mouth with a pen and said ‘say less’ like it was poetry. He laughed because when you have an audience you laugh. She didn’t come back. Then you came,” he added, establishing a timeline as a child might in a playground: events as beads, strung in the order in which they made the most sense.

Rea looked at O’Connor, who looked at the window, which had a view of a tree that insisted on being that tree every year and no one had convinced it not to. “Thank you,” she said to Perrin. “If anyone says you talk too much, send them to me. I am accumulating their names on a delightful small list. Can I ask you one more unkind favour. Don’t post about this. Don’t even text about it. You can sing about it if you must, in the shower, in a language your mother doesn’t understand.”

“That’s rude,” he said, and smiled because being rude on purpose with a stranger is an intimacy Britain allows itself only on high days. “I won’t. I’ll tell Mr. O’Connor if anything odd happens. He can use his teacher voice on me.”

The day wore its hours thin. A minister stood by algae and declared that safety was hearty and available while avoiding eye contact with a goose. The press learned the words spree and terror again and placed them in sentences where they did not belong because they often do not have the time to carry words to the right places. Rea went to the library where the hostel key was kept. The librarian had long fingers and a cardigan that looked like a disguise. She showed Rea the shelf. The book had the tender feel of something that had been forgiven many times. The key was not in it. The librarian said, “She takes the book out and sits in the window and turns the same page back and forward so the room won’t notice she’s not reading,” with the authority of people who have chosen the written word as a shield and then discovered it had holes in it. “She makes lists on the inside cover. We’ve left them there because we don’t throw lists away here. It’s not that kind of place.”

The list this time was shorter than the list on Miss Hamish’s fridge but it had the same ache in it. It said Assembly with a tick beside it and the date from a week ago. It said Parent Eve and a little drawing of a plate. It said Homework twice. It said Second, and she had circled it until the paper had gone thin. At the bottom she had written Practice under a line and then had crossed the whole thing out. Under that, squeezed in like a guilt, was Jam.

Rea copied the list into her own book. She asked the librarian whether she had ever been told to use her inside voice. The woman pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose and made a sound that was both laughter and irritation at herself. “I was born with only an inside voice,” she said. “I had to learn an outside one when I started telling the council we needed a lift. Everything else is elective.”

On the pavement outside, Rea called Arthur and told him the list. She let the word Jam sit there on the air where it could be heard by a passer-by who would think her domestically odd. Arthur took the words and stacked them the way he stacks cards on a table at three in the afternoon when the day’s plot requests an intermission. “She’s rehearsing,” he said. “She’s rehearsing not to do it. Or rehearsing to do it better so you’ll be impressed. That’s the thing about people like her. They want a mark. They want someone to underline. If we refuse to be impressed, perhaps she will be bored.”

“She doesn’t get bored,” Rea said. “I don’t think she is capable of it in the way other people are. She fills every under with a plan. If there’s nothing else, she will plan kindness into rooms that have never had it. It is her body’s rebellion and its punishment. Keep the bridges filled. Keep the staffrooms in company. Ask caretakers to whistle in corridors. Ask someone to draw a goblin on a board and laugh kindly at it again so the rooms remember they can.”

“To-do,” Arthur said. “You do realise if we survive this I am going to force you to write a memo no one will read and send it to everyone anyway.”

Kian phoned instead of texting because there are days when the sound of a voice is required to complete a sentence. He told her a headteacher had praised him for composure and asked him to submit a best practice paragraph about “holding the room” for the trust newsletter. He had written one that said tell the boy you liked his answer and don’t make it about you, then deleted it and written something about structured retrieval that made no sense to anyone who had never taught a class of humans. He asked whether he had done the right thing. She told him there was no right thing, that was the point, and he said he hated that, that was the point, and then they both laughed the way tired colleagues laugh through the gap between their ribs.

It was almost dark when Catalina stepped out from under a set of steps into a piece of city that had been papered with older crimes. She had eaten an apple with the precision of someone who had rationed crunchy things and then allowed herself a reprieve. She had the cheap cherry smell clinging to her like an anecdote. She carried the camera like penance. She had pinned her hair back with an elastic that had once done duty around a packet of basil; it made her look briefly like a person who might be one careless gesture away from dancing. She put her hands in her coat pockets and found the coin there and pressed it to her tongue, gently, like a woman kissing a photograph after deciding not to send it.

She had promised Rea in a way she did not understand. The promise had not been to stop. She did not know what the verb would be for the thing she had promised to do. To be honest near a person who had earned honesty? To stand in a room without arranging it into a stage? To let someone else’s idea of a list sit next to hers and enjoy the conflict? The city had set its outside voice to stun for the evening commute. The bridges did their work without comment. A caretaker under Blackfriars whistled two bars of something she could not place and then three bars of something she could; the point, she understood, was that he kept whistling. Under the next bridge another man sat with a mop and sang badly; it was an act of violence against despair so casual she could have laughed if she had not been so serious.

She thought of Miss Hamish’s mouth and the ink on it and the small neat letters she had made with a child’s pen. She thought of how the pen had been a toy and she had made it into an instrument and then into a weapon and none of those had been true. She thought of Rea’s hand hovering, not touching, and the way that had been the most intimate thing anyone had done to her in a year. She went to the library window and looked at the place where she sometimes sat with the voice book and she did not sit. She went to the hostel and watched a boy check in with his whole body, then watched him change his mind when his mother called him in tears. She went under the set of stairs where she had promised to meet herself and found instead a pair of pigeons conducting a relationship with admirable determination.

When the message came in, Rea was in her car, watching a woman teach her son how to blow on chips so they would not burn his mouth. The screen lit up almost politely. The image that loaded was one she had not been entirely prepared for. Not lips. Not a dead thing. A page torn from an exercise book. The date at the top was written in the child’s hand that Catalina had learned so well. The learning objective was written in a teacher’s rushed tidy: I can present to an audience. The success criteria had been underlined in green, a colour the trust had decided was less traumatising. At the bottom, where the comments live and the adult attempts to behave, there was a sentence that made Rea’s chest go peculiar. “Use your inside voice,” it said, “but let it fly.”

The photograph had a shadow in it. The shadow was of a camera strap. Rea magnified. In the curve of shadow was the edge of a mug with a fat rim and a tiny lip chip. She had seen that mug this week. She had poured from it and not drunk. The staffroom at St. Zachary’s. Or the staffroom at the academy that refused its own origins. The mugs are an unglamorous archive of institutional identity. She called Arthur and he said he could be wrong in the next five minutes if she preferred, but otherwise he thought it was the Southwark place where Daines had announced sharing circles. Rea swore under her breath because sometimes the words you are allowed to say in front of children do not get the job done.

They arrived without drama because drama was always happening elsewhere. The receptionist tilted her head at their IDs and tilted it further at their urgency. She said, “Second floor,” as if schools are their own planets, with staircases as orbits. In the staffroom there were the mugs. There was the microwave that made the room’s mirror. There was a goblin on the board, a new one drawn with effort by someone who felt the joke belonged to another school and drew it anyway in the hope that jokes travel. There was a teacher with her head in the fridge, counting yoghurts for a club that had more children than its grant. And there was Catalina, small and inevitable, sitting in a chair that was too low, with the camera on the table and her hands around a cup she had not prepared.

The teacher in the fridge looked up, saw Catalina, saw the camera, saw Rea and Arthur arriving as if they had been pushed gently by a friendly tide, and chose a very wise course. She said, “Do you want the good jam,” to no one in particular, and then left the room with a yoghurt and a purposeful gait that put a bulkhead between danger and the corridor.

“We can do this without a theatre,” Rea said softly. “We can do this in a key that doesn’t make anyone sing. Hello, Catalina.”

“It isn’t theatre if the room has always been a stage,” Catalina said. She drew the cup closer not because she wanted it but because she had taken from kitchens for long enough to be unable to resist. “There’s a girl,” she added, as if she were reporting an incident in a courtly way. “She’s eleven. She has a mouth like a question. She told a boy today to stop correcting her pronunciation and he cried because he recognised his own mother in the way she said stop. I sat on the stairs and wanted to put a line on someone’s lips that said Look, and I did not. That is my victory.”

Arthur stayed by the door, because he had learned in a hundred rooms that men standing where the door is closed need to practice being politely fearsome. He studied Catalina as if she were weather, the kind that ruins a picnic if you are lucky and a season if you are not. Rea sat and made her body smaller, not in apology and not in a trick. She did it so that Catalina’s body might return to a normal map of itself. “You sent me a page,” she said. “You chose the wrong margin. That will bother you later. I am sorry in advance. Tell me what you want. I mean it boringly.”

“I want a school where at least one teacher breaks and cries and the children don’t get punished for seeing it,” Catalina said, after a moment in which she weighed words like lemons and chose only the ones that had skin she could trust. “I want a list on every fridge that says tell him he can and tells the him exactly what the can is. I want to give back the idea that a mouth is for being small. I want one person, one, to say to me that the coin was cruelty and not wit.”

“It was cruelty,” Rea said. “It was a joke made by a man for whom quiet children are tidiness, not people. It was the kind of small harm that unthreads its way through a life and one day takes a photograph of someone’s mouth. Give me the coin.”

Catalina reached into her pocket and touched the metal and then looked at Rea in a way that resembled appetite and grief arguing quietly in a shop. “If I give you the coin I have to not have it,” she said. “If I don’t have it, I might make a new one and give it to someone else because I got good at passing pains on. You would be surprised how much technique there is in it. I’m an expert now. The world made me a specialist.”

“I believe you,” Rea said. “And I have a box in my house marked Not Now that has room for a coin. I can make it Now. I can make Now a place for this to sit where it won’t cut anyone’s tongue. You can come and look at it. You can even take it back, if one day you become the person who ought to keep it. This is a ridiculous offer but it is the one I have.”

Catalina smiled in that way that happened on one side of her face first. “Doctor,” she said. “I did not think there would be anyone left who offered me a ridiculous thing I could use. Everyone else offers me truth. I am full.”

Arthur coughed, and it was not the polite version. “We can’t take this to your house,” he said, and then corrected himself because he had long ago learned to translate his own instincts into something more negotiable. “We can’t only take it to your house. Catalina. We have rooms. We have people who sit in them and whose job it is to manage pain while making sure it doesn’t become spectacle. We have biscuits so boring they make a person tell the truth because otherwise why are they there. We have paperwork that will make you angry and also keep you alive. Come with us to one of those rooms. At some point what you want can be a formal request and not a manifesto written on a whiteboard between the dates of inset days.”

Catalina looked at the goblin with jam. She looked at the microwave reflection and saw the version of herself that looked like a child pressed to a window and she almost laughed at the absurd kindness of being able to choose that version. She put her hand in her pocket and took out the coin. It was not an old pound. It was a new one, less pleasing to the palm. It had teeth like a polite animal. She put it on the table as if it were a sleeping small thing and pushed it toward Rea with the tip of her finger. “I took a photograph today and then I deleted it,” she said, in a voice that had learned how to enjoy certain kinds of confession. “Do you know what that made me. Not good. It made me an editor. I hate that word. I want to be a student. I never got to be the good kind.”

“You’re being it now,” Rea said. She reached for the coin and did not let her hand tremble. “You’re being the kind of student who teaches the person at the front. It is the only kind worth being, unless you are rich.”

The building, infuriatingly, remembered it had systems. Somewhere a bell rang with that committee tone. The hallway filled with the movement of children who had not agreed to be dramatic and were therefore perfect. A woman pushed the staffroom door open and then stopped dead because the room was occupied by the kind of silence that suggests a secret. “Sorry,” she said, and pointed at the kettle. “I’m just—” and then wisely held her phrase and left without the tea, electing to go thirsty rather than disturb something that might do her good later if she was very careful.

Catalina moved her fingertip over the rim of her cup, collecting condensation like evidence. “There will be another one if I leave with you,” she said. “There is always another one of me. A girl who has had a scarf tied around her mouth during the coach trip. A girl who has been told to make her inside voice smaller until it’s useful. You’ll have to keep building rooms and making tea and asking caretakers to sing. You won’t win and you won’t lose. Are you up to being in the middle.”

“Yes,” Rea said. “It is where I moved. It was very unfashionable of me. Everyone else chose ends.”

Catalina nodded as if accepting a timetable. She lifted the camera strap off her head the way a person removes a collar and put it down beside the coin. Rea did not exhale because breathing is not relief; it is maintenance. The door opened again and a head appeared, this time a man who did not scan rooms for mood for a living and therefore did not see what he had walked into. “Fire drill,” he said brightly. “We’re doing it now. The person said.”

“The person,” Arthur said, and the phrase put his head up like a dog’s. “What person.”

“The person who said,” the man said, and smiled because he had become the messenger and was briefly enjoying the absence of responsibility that accompanies news.

Catalina stood up and looked at the wall where the fire drill procedures were printed. She looked at the bold text. She looked at the smaller text. She smiled in the way a woman smiles when she has been offered governance and declines it with grace. “I didn’t plan that,” she said. “I am not every mischief. Sometimes buildings make their own jokes.”

They walked with the adults to the yard the way adult bodies learn to walk in neatness when the sound that the bell makes insists. Catalina took her place among the visitors and did not fidget. The children did the little hop that drills encourage as a release for not being allowed to shout. A teacher took a register and shouted out names with the injustice of a witness at a wedding. Rea stood beside Catalina and looked straight ahead and tried, very hard, to make this be a photograph, to fix it: the woman without a coin, the camera asleep, a yard where the word Jam had been a joke and would perhaps be again. For a second the city held its breath and then released it, like a person walking under something that might fall and deciding to be brave enough not to glance up.

On the far side of the yard, beyond the railings where the world did not have to be watched, a small boy took a deep breath. He had been told earlier that his voice carries and he must be careful with it. He had been very careful for forty minutes. Then he let go and sang two lines of a song he had been on the verge of loving for months and had now given permission to himself to own. It was not good singing. It was the only kind that makes you want to be kinder. A teacher put her hand over her mouth in the involuntary way people do when they have seen the real thing in a room where it was not expected. Catalina made a noise that was not laughter and not crying. Rea put a finger to her own lip to contain something that did not need to be contained and let it go anyway.

When the crowd drifted back in and doors started their little chorus of closing, a woman whose job was to count visitors and forget them approached Rea with a clipboard and the innocent confidence of bureaucrats. “Miss Penny,” she said, and looked at Catalina as one looks at a lump in a batter that must mean something. “You haven’t signed out.”

“She’s with me,” Rea said, and the me did not mean police and did not mean doctor and did not mean saviour. It meant the middle.

Catalina nodded. “Yes,” she said. “I am with her.”

They got as far as the corridor that smelled of perfume and laminating before the building remembered it was a building. Somewhere an alarm that was not a drill tripped. Somewhere a voice on a tannoy began a sentence that was not a drill sentence and then stopped. Arthur’s phone did that thing where a grown man jumps, because modernity has made him so. He listened, his face doing the arithmetic you do when the world changes your plan without asking. “Lambeth,” he said, already moving. “Parents’ evening. Homework. She’s not the only under we’ve been missing.”

Rea heard a sentence echo its way down the corridor and find her. It was Catalina’s voice. It belonged to neither of them and to both. “You’re going to have to choose,” she said, and did not mean between the outside and the inside, or the river and the road, or the old job and the new one. She meant between two rooms that had both decided to need her. Rea looked at the coin in her pocket and the camera in her hand and the corridor that had decided to be longer than usual and then she chose, because that is what a body does when the bell rings and not enough people know which door takes them out into air.Chapter Eight

She handed Arthur the camera and the coin in the same movement, palm to palm, as if she were passing a baby to someone who had not admitted he wanted to carry it. He made the little grunt men make when responsibility gets heavier than expected, and tucked both away as if a pocket could be loyal. Catalina watched without pretence. She had chosen to stay seated while the corridors discovered an alarm they liked better than the last one, and she did not reach for the strap that had lived on her collarbone like a thin animal for months. She was learning the muscle that holds a decision in place after the light has moved. Rea touched two fingers to the table to ground herself against the building’s hum, looked once, very directly, at Catalina, and said, “I will come back for you,” which was not theatre and not promise; it was a timetable written on a board in a room where everyone had already brought their pens.

She slid into the corridor, moving the way you learn to move if your first career taught you that the difference between panic and speed is angle. The building was doing its own marshalling, a slightly embarrassed version, lights apologising for being too bright, loudspeakers choosing a register only committees ever choose. Arthur asked a uniform to sit in the doorway with his body at an angle that suggested welcome to some and obstacle to others. He crouched so his head was level with Catalina’s because he had once been surprised to find his height had turned him into a method, and he disliked unexamined methods more than he disliked not knowing how to make tea. “We’ll walk slowly to a room with soft chairs,” he said. “If anyone in there calls you anything you don’t like, you can call me Arthur very loudly and I will give them paperwork to eat. We have blankets terrible enough to inspire truth and biscuits that have outlived three governments. Do you need anything before we move.”

Catalina slid a fingertip under the cup and felt for the circle of wet it had left as if a stain were data. She nodded once and then again, not to agree but to practise not disagreeing. “When I was little,” she said, “I thought pastoral meant fields and sheep. It turned out to be stairs and men with clipboards. If you call me Miss Penny I will go back under the table.”

“Catalina,” he said. He took his tone down to where good men talk to children about foxes they might meet. “We will call you Catalina.”

The drive to Lambeth was a tension between the city’s arrangement and Rea’s refusal to be late to a thing only she had heard phrased correctly. She cut over a bridge and did not look at the water because for once she did not trust it not to ask for her attention at an unfair price. Her phone ticked out little scraps of other people’s work: Southwark steady, the caretaker at Blackfriars had started on Bohemian Rhapsody and was being adored by three teenagers who did not yet know how to give that particular adoration safely, a pharmacist on the north bank had remembered a woman who had asked whether a certain cream made the lips less likely to bleed in the cold and had been ashamed of her own biology when told no. The call from the Lambeth site was not a scream; it was a very competent woman in a blazer who had chosen a career in admin and discovered late that it meant air traffic control. “Parents’ evening doubled with homework amnesty,” she said, and Rea loved and hated the phrase equally. “We thought it would be kind to get it all done in one room. One of the fathers says he’s Pastoral and wants to address us all. No one exactly told him he couldn’t in time.”

“Where is he,” Rea asked, angling the car down into a street that had been a horses’ idea of a good time a long time ago and now was a bin’s. “Tall? Small? Alone.”

“He’s the kind of height that means you’d describe his shoes instead,” came back, with a breath that sounded expensive and then forgave itself. “He smells like toner and limescale. He keeps touching the megaphone and then not. He asked whether the homework policy had been agreed by governors or gods. He is standing under the big banner that says Your Voice Matters and I have already decided to burn it after this.”

The hall was the kind of room that pretends to be humble until it discovers microphones. Parents’ evenings are theatres in spite of themselves; folded chairs, tables with the small cloths like compliance, teachers with faces they had prepared at home and will remove on the bus. There was a “Homework Amnesty” table made festive by two harassed sixth-formers who had been told resilience looks like bunting. A board showed a mind map titled What is Homework For, with arrows suggesting such confident concepts as Consolidation and Parental Engagement, and one smaller bubble in a child’s hand, mis-spelt and perfect: becos it is ours. The megaphone sat on the deputy’s chair like a dog unsure whether it had been good.

He stood where the light from the high windows made everybody’s faces a little unkind. He had the Pastoral badge you could buy two bridges down, laminated imprecisely. His shirt was the colour men pick when they want to be trusted by other men and ignored by women. He was not Catalina’s cousin, he was not her complement; he was a citizen of a parallel wound. When Rea entered he saw her and did his own arithmetic. He did not lift the megaphone. He lifted a child’s exercise book instead, the kind that smells of graphite and ambition, and placed it at the edge of the amnesty table with exaggerated care, like a man returning a borrowed thing in a fairy tale and daring the room to appreciate his etiquette.

“This is a conversation,” he said, without any amplification, and he had a voice that had learned to stand in doorways. “This school sends home work as if home were a room that always exists. I am not Pastoral and I am not a governor. I am a father who owns a rented kettle and a child who cries when the paper gets wet. I am here to have my say and then to leave.”

Rea did not tell him to stop. She let the first square of his speech lay itself on the hall floor like tiles. Parents had their tired faces on, the particular bone-deep pain of leaving work early to be told their child is bright in class and a challenge in transitions. Teachers folded their hands over lapels as if they were covering an open pocket. A woman who was undoubtedly the school’s heart stood by the display about phonics with tears already in her throat because some people live near the surface and have been punished for it enough to know how to hide until it matters. Rea moved to stand not near him, not opposite him, but at an angle that would mean he would have to twist to make a theatre of any objection.

“What would you like us to do with your say,” she asked, taking the megaphone off the chair and handing it to the deputy without looking at her. “Would you like it to become policy. Anecdote. Someone’s story at the bus stop. We can do two out of three. The third will make itself whatever it wants to be.”

He blinked as if she had put a fan in front of his idea and it was going to have to keep its hair on. “I wrote the policy for my house,” he said, as if that made him impressive. “No homework on a Tuesday because that’s the day she has her mother. Fifteen minutes on a Thursday because that’s the day we’ve got Wi-Fi if the upstairs man is feeling philanthropic. At weekends she reads out loud to me while I pretend to sleep so my back stops hurting. Your policy says thirty minutes every night regardless. I am here to ask: can the men who write policies come to my house and look at the fixtures.”

The deputy had taken the megaphone and was cradling it like a child she didn’t want anyone to know she’d had. Teachers inched into clusters the way bodies do when they decide their numbers are their shield. A security man who had not been hired to understand paradox laid his weight across his feet and decided to watch Rea because he had a sense for where the temperature lives in a room. She nodded as the father spoke, not performatively, not the nod that suggests cameras, but the nod that says I am using your information now, in real time.

“I can write down your Tuesday,” she said. “I can write it on a whiteboard in an office where a policy likes to pretend paper is neutral. I can take it to a person who has convinced themselves that Ofsted is an adjective. You will not be in that room. This will make you right and sad at the same time. Do you have anything else you need to leave us before you depart.”

He did not expect to be invited to relinquish. He was tuned to resistance, not receipt. He had a pen in his hand, the cheap kind that leaks on thumbs like evidence. He looked at it and thought about being theatrical. He thought about drawing a line on a mouth and writing a word, because people are magpies when it comes to harm; they see a shining method and try it on. He turned the pen in his fingers and then put it behind his ear because his mother had taught him that trick when he was a boy and had discovered later that tricks are sometimes the only family you get to keep. “I wanted to say less,” he said, and the choice of words was coincidence or contagion and Rea was too tired to decide which. “But then I realised that in this building less means silence. I cannot afford silence. It has a ruinous price. I would like you to say on your website that on a Tuesday we do not send things home that make a child lie about a father’s patience.”

Rea breathed, and it made a sound because the body likes to be unladylike when the stakes are boring. “We can do that,” she said. She tilted her head at the deputy in a way that carried no rank and absolute instruction. “Put it on the website. Put it in the letters. If anyone complains we will give them two words to learn to love: local context. And if they complain louder, we will ask them whether they have ever lived in a building whose walls were made out of other people’s televisions.”

A hand went up. It was muscle memory, the way hands go up in halls. A woman in a cardigan so textured you could have lived in it said, “We used to do homework breakfast,” and she looked ashamed, as if kindness were an imposition on a school that prides itself on grit. “Toast in the hall. A teacher would sit, anyone could bring whatever they had not done, and we would do it together so home didn’t have to do more than it had done already. We stopped when the funding went. We could start again if we called it something else and pretended bread is free.”

The father with the badge that was not his turned his face so that he would not have to show the room what relief looks like when it is belated and therefore suspicious. Rea looked at the children walking through on their way to the choir club, teaching their mouths to belong to them. On the amnesty table, three exercise books sat like offerings, and she made herself not flinch, because offerings are often what you have when you have nothing else, and who was she to sneer at the economy of worship. “Start again,” she said. “Call it whatever the spreadsheet will respect. Use words like Catch Up and Intervention if you must. Parents will translate on the way home.”

He almost smiled. He almost put the pen down in the cup provided for pens. He almost left. This is the problem with almosts; they are so obedient to narrative that the body forgets it is allowed to disturb the script. A boy who had been eating crisps as if they were a plan ran into the back of a chair and yelped in that small, pure way that sounds like a parent’s past. The father’s attention shot to the boy’s mouth, and the hand that had placed the pen behind his ear went up without his permission. He wrote on that mouth without touching it because air is also a surface, and the word he wrote was No. Rea watched the letters take form in the air and then fall away because language cannot usually be made literal outside theatre. She stepped between the man and the boy without making either of them feel insulted by the fact of her body. “We’re done,” she said, with a finality that did not need to be loud because everything in her tone held the corridor where she had already made a choice.

The deputy exhaled a laugh that everyone in the room was grateful to mistake for wit. The security man moved, slowly, as if his shoes had learned manners. The father loosened his grip on the room because someone had shown him what letting go looked like. He put the Pastoral badge on the table like a surrender note, and it made the small clack of plastic against wood that bad ideas make when they are retired. A woman whose hair said “I do thirty things before nine” pressed a cup of tea into his hands because some people come equipped with triage. He looked at Rea as if he would like to change allegiance mid-battle and then nodded, not to bow and not to defy, but to confirm that he could leave without being chased.

Back at St. Zachary’s the soft room turned its lights down and did its job of being kinder than the corridor without congratulating itself. Catalina sat with the blanket and did not put it around her shoulders because heat from outside has always made her suspicious. The detective with the practiced voice had left the room after telling her his name as if he were giving her a tissue. In his place a woman with hands that had unpacked too many photocopier boxes sat and asked questions whose answers were not the point. “When did you last sleep,” she said, and Catalina said, “Last week,” and they both knew that this did not matter and might be everything. Arthur stood at the glass that is not supposed to be anything and watched without the glove of a mirror. He did not interfere because he had promised himself years ago to let women do clever things when clever things were what a room required.

Catalina did not narrate her childhood because some stories have been overfished. She did not produce a neat line to the present because neatness is a product and she had no interest in marketing. She said, “He isn’t mine,” and the woman across from her said, “Who isn’t,” and she said, “The man with the badge. He is carrying a smaller debt that does not want my currency. He will put it down if someone lets him keep his Tuesdays.” She said, “My list is not an inheritance. I wrote it myself and I held the pen wrong.” She said, “If you put me in a room with fluorescent lights and a peeling poster about your rights I will bite until my mouth is mine again. If you put me in a room with a plant I will water it. This is intelligence about nothing, I am aware.”

The woman made a sound that was not mm and not ah. “Do you want to be charged today,” she asked, not because it was a choice, but because offering a choice makes both of you people. “We can hold the papers like a line and iron them later, or we can make a ceremony of them now. You have returned a camera and a coin. You have not returned time. We are not prosecutors in here. We are secretaries with better shoes. You can rest if you like.”

Catalina smiled that one-sided smile that meant the other side of her face was being reserved for a day when it would be safer. “No,” she said. “No to rest and no to ceremony. Yes to time later. Yes to being watched by someone who does not want to turn me into a story with a neat arc. Yes to a sandwich I will share because if I eat alone I still become a table. I would like Rea’s hand near me when the papers start shouting. She has a way of making hands mind their mouths.”

Slowly, as if the building were making room for a small and very precise event, the evening at Lambeth resolved itself into what it had been all along: a school night where children were asked to be older than the room allowed and adults were asked to perform an understanding of adolescence that their own adolescent selves would have found laughable. The father finished his tea and left his badge on the table. The deputy struck the megaphone with her finger as if to test whether it was tuning to her authority. The “Homework Amnesty” sign sagged and then reasserted itself with admirable cheer. Rea stood in the noticer’s position and let her body find the lower gear it likes after an alarm.

“You can have my number,” the woman in the cardigan said, appearing at Rea’s elbow with the stealth care of librarians. “For the breakfast. If anyone higher than us says ‘liability’ I will tell them my cardigan has jurisdiction. You can give my number to the father and tell him Tuesdays are a religion in this building now.”

“Bread is a religion,” Rea said. “We will say it’s maths. Thank you.” She looked down at the amnesty books. The top one had an essay with the learning objective I can argue politely. The child had written that politeness was a kind of armour and asked whether you could wear it over pyjamas if fear had made you not dress properly. The teacher had circled the question mark and written, yes. She pressed the book closed and let the teacher’s certainty stand taller than her own.

When she reached for her phone she found that someone had sent her a picture that did not look like a picture until it resolved. It was the soft room at St. Zachary’s from a security camera angle only the building could love. Catalina, bent over a table, making a new list very neatly. At the top she had written Room Where I Cannot Make A Stage, and beneath, she had written three names and a thing to do beside each. Tell Perrin he can lead. Kian to be told boredom saves lives. O’Connor to forgive himself out loud. Beside her hand lay the coin, flat and obedient, and beside that the camera, turned off and sulking. Arthur had sent the photo with no commentary because men like him avoid the sentimental until after the paperwork, but the fact of it landed in Rea’s chest like a warm parcel.

On the way back across the river the city tried to make her consider profound things and she refused. She allowed herself instead one small indigestion of pride for a room where a girl had sung two lines without permission, and one small mercy extended to a man who had put his pen behind his ear instead of on a mouth. She parked in a place where you are not supposed to because nobody was using it and this is how civilisation collapses, and walked in through the back entrance because front doors in schools always make a scene. The soft room had the light of a waiting room in heaven and the carpet of a council chamber on a hot day. Catalina looked up when Rea opened the door and did not say hello because some greetings only work once.

“You chose,” Catalina said, as if they had been in the middle of a conversation and the intervening hour had been a parenthesis.

“I did,” Rea said. “I chose the corridor first and then the hall and then the sandwich. Now I choose you because the others are balanced and you are the piece currently rolling.”

They did not touch. They sat close enough that the blanket reached both their knees and neither of them resented it for that familiarity. The detective with the practiced voice set a file down exactly where it would be useful later and left, shutting the door in a way that suggested he had learned the art of a quiet hinge. Arthur leaned against the glass and did not make the joke he could have made about a coin in a woman’s pocket and a camera turned to face the wall.

“You will be charged,” Rea said, and the fairness of telling someone the shape of what is about to happen is a version of food. “You will be written into cold language and then warmed only by the way someone says your name on a tape. You will be tried. In both senses. Some people will call you names that belong to men whose acts were paid for differently. Some people will call you a symptom. Some will call you a cause. I will call you Catalina because it is the only name that makes the maths right in my head.”

Catalina rested her chin on the heel of her hand and looked less like a goblin than she had ever allowed herself to. “Will there be a room where I get to say the words I have been practising that sound like apologies but are not surrender letters,” she asked, and behind the question was a landscape you could live your whole life in, if you had the wrong guide.

“There will,” Rea said. “It will make you angry that it is the right room. We will keep that anger and pour it into a quiet thing that eats cruelty without fuss. We will put your lists on a wall where children can see them and not know they are reading a woman’s spine. You will hate me. You will also ask me to bring you a plant and I will bring you one because I want to find out whether we can keep anything alive in here.”

Catalina laughed properly, once, because absurdity had finally found a seat it liked. “Bring a plant that forgives,” she said. “If you bring a succulent I will bite it.”

Outside, the station did its late routine: the tired jokes, the bad coffee counting as a meeting, the man who stays past his hours because he is afraid to go home to a woman who loves him and the quiet that stands behind her. Arthur came in with a sandwich so unambitious it felt Christian. He offered it without comment and Catalina opened it with the skill of a person who has made a life of unwrapping things and finding them not quite as promised but edible. When she bit, she closed her eyes as if to keep from crying, and then opened them as if to keep from laughing.

Somewhere in the file stack a form asked a box to be ticked for whether an offender had demonstrated remorse, and the decision about where that tick belongs would be made by a person who had never been in this room. Rea held that in one hand and Catalina’s coin in the other and found, to her surprise, that she was old enough now not to let either ruin her.

The night put its hand flat on the city. Bridges slept without malice. Under them, the men with mops whistled themselves brave because someone had told them they were useful and not just economically. A father in Lambeth wrote Tuesday on a calendar so insistently the square tore and took a little of the week with it. A boy called Perrin caught himself singing in a supermarket aisle and did not apologise. Kian stood at his sink practicing a sentence he was going to say to a child in the morning that began with “thank you” and did not end with “but.” O’Connor put the pig mask back into its bag with the reverence of a man who understands props. Rea, finally, wrote on her own whiteboard in the privacy of a flat with a coat rack that leaned and a box that still read Not Now. She wrote: Mouths are not problems. Then she went to sleep with the radio on low and let the city mumble to her the way a person does when they are trying not to confess and are relieved to be asked.Chapter Nine

The charge room had the air of a church hall after a jumble sale, the holiness gone but the sense of having hosted something human still clinging to its corners. Paperwork made its small, relentless weather on the table. A two-bar heater clicked like an insect that has learned to be punctual. Rea brought the plant she had promised, a spider plant with a shaggy confidence and three fresh offshoots that looked like children leaning over a balcony. She had chosen it because it was the sort of green that forgives, all elasticity and second chances, a thing that propagates itself whenever a room is looking elsewhere. The officer at the door examined it with the solemnity usually reserved for backpacks and bad intentions, and then waved it through as if sparing himself the embarrassment of arguing with chlorophyll.

Catalina had slept and it had not repaired her, which was in keeping with sleep’s limitations when a life has run its mouth ragged. She looked smaller without the camera, her collarbones declared without the strap’s black underline. The duty solicitor sat beside her, a woman with the pragmatic kindness of someone who neither imagines herself a saviour nor tolerates being mistaken for a machine. She had a biro tucked into her bun and the clipped politeness of a person who had been trained to survive in rooms where the air was owned by men and the truth was expected to queue. She glanced at the plant, at Rea, at the single paper cup someone had placed in a way that suggested they had once read about hospitality and were doing their best to emulate the concept in hostile architecture.

“We can take a statement,” the solicitor said, opening a notebook that already contained lives. “We can leave one gap neat enough to be filled later. We can decline to make you into a shape that will be convenient for a press release. Catalina, is that all right. Doctor Rea will not interrupt unless interruption becomes a form of medicine.”

Catalina touched one of the spider plant’s dangling babies and the plant answered by swinging a fraction, a tiny conga of grace. “You can write,” she said. “But if you write goblin I will leave the room and go under the table and tie my own bells back on. You can write teacher and mouth and lists. You can write coin. You will write the word jam six times because I like the way it steadies the hand.”

It was not confession and not theatre. It was the slow laying down of a path with stones, each small weight an act of ownership and relinquishment. She gave them the walks under bridges and the lipsticks purchased near till points; she described the way some classrooms smelled like pencils and mothballs and others like exhaustion trying its luck. She told them what she had done to the bodies without naming the parts you name when you want to make a thing into a weapon. “I looked at their mouths,” she said, and the solicitor looked at the plant and breathed through her nostrils in the manner of women keeping their own hearts away from sharp edges. “I waited for them to stop using them. I put words on them that were mine because I had been asked to use fewer. I returned an idea to a face, that’s all. It isn’t all. I am practising saying the larger sentence.”

The detective with the practiced voice stood behind the glass and did not practice it now. He watched Rea place the plant at the edge of the table, watched Catalina’s hand avoid touching the pot in case it counted as need. He had been to training sessions with bullet-pointed slides about empathy and boundaries and words you put in reports when you feel things you shouldn’t, and none of that suggested what to do when a woman you had feared for a month petted a plant like it was a kitten unfit for the outside world.

After, there were charges. The words were large and unkind and insisted on their own power. Three counts of murder. One of attempted harm with intent where a camera had been left like a promise. One of unlawful entry in rooms where the light had been set for other stories. The CPS barrister was tidy in a way that might have been personal or cultural and there was no point blaming him for either. He asked Rea to step out twice and the second time she did, because even in the rooms she can run, there are doors that don’t need her to be a hinge. In the corridor she leaned her shoulder to the strip-lit hum and called Arthur to tell him that there was now to be a leak, and she preferred it came from a carton she’d chosen rather than a drain someone had weaponised.

The superintendent wanted a label. They always do. He tried on two and watched them fail in the mirror’s light. Mouth killer sounded like a cheap horror and invited the wrong audience. The Under-Bridge Photographer sounded like a man and that was instructive. “We will not,” Rea said, and did not raise her voice because he had been in the room long enough to know when quiet carries. “We will use names and acts. We will not make her a noun that prints well. You may talk about patterns if you must. You will not call her clever. Clever is how you pay women who scare you without having to feel anything that costs you sleep.”

He was not her enemy and he had a marriage that allowed him to disagree with women without sulking about it for two weeks. He nodded and asked for three sentences he could give to the microphones that would keep cameras from camping in front of parents’ houses. She gave him five because the day was filthy with mercy and she’d developed a habit. He asked if she was tired and she did not insult him by pretending she wasn’t. He told her he was sorry for the bit where they had pulled her old file, and she told him it would have been ridiculous if they hadn’t. They did the small ritual of colleagues promising not to damage each other on purpose and then walked out to give the city the minimum number of syllables required by accountability.

Miss Hamish’s mother was not theatrical in her grieving. She wore a cardigan that made sense on her even with the sleeves pushed up as if she were still making packed lunches. The flat smelled of a plant that had been with them long enough to remember the accident with a radiator, and of onions because onions do not abandon you even when you are not hungry. Rea took her tea in a mug that had seen better mouths and worse, and she did not correct the older woman when she called her Doctor twice and then Detective once, because all three were versions of what Rea had come there to be. She told her what had happened in a way that made room for the past rather than cannibalising it. She avoided nouns that picked fights. She described the lists on the fridge as appointments with kindness and watched the mother’s mouth do something like math when she said the words out loud, the way grief must always inventory before it can allow itself any ceremony.

“They came for her art,” the mother said, and Rea could not tell whether she meant still life fruit and collages made with sugar paper or the thing her daughter had done with children’s inner weather. “She wrote things down because she always thought the future was taking notes. She was a good girl,” and here, the woman winced at herself, because the phrase is a country with a border that moves depending on who is in power. “She made everything into an instruction. I used to tell her to stop being a timetable. It isn’t fair, is it, to be that and then to end up a line someone else tries to put under their own words.”

“No,” Rea said, and allowed the monosyllable to be a blessing. “It isn’t fair. It’s also not the end of the line. We’re not neat enough to make endings stick. I would like to take a photograph from her wall,” she added, surprised at herself, “not of a person, just a colour she used too much. Sometimes evidence wants to help and doesn’t know how.”

The picture was of a jam jar, painted too red for realism, the lid a silly blue, the label blank. It had the quality of a joke told at precisely the wrong time and therefore redeemed. Miss Hamish had painted light at the edge as if the sun had just remembered it had plans. The mother let Rea take it down and wrap it in newspaper and carry it away like a small risk. On the way out, she touched Rea’s sleeve and said, “If you see the girl, the one with the camera. If you see her mouth when she isn’t being looked at, tell me whether it looks like the kind of mouth you can teach to blow on tea. I don’t know why I want to know. It would help me, I think, to know the weather inside that expression.”

Kian didn’t wait for permission because new teachers cannot, or they lose their shape entirely. He started Homework Breakfast on a Wednesday because that is sometimes the only way to get to a Tuesday. The caretaker carried in the trestles with the gentle pride of a man who had never been asked to position furniture at the centre of pedagogy, and he whistled something that wanted to be a musical and wasn’t. The first day, three children came and two ate and one pretended to, and it rained toast crumbs onto the floor as if an altar had been doing small miracles no one had thought to record. The second day, six came and a boy whose father had asked for Tuesdays paused at the door and then came in sideways and said he was only here to see whether jam was as good as songs. On the third day, a girl who hated mornings brought her mother because she had learned something you cannot expect Year Five to tell you in the language of policy: that breakfast is work you can do together without becoming an argument.

O’Connor sent a voice note because gods had invented them to make certain apologies possible without eye contact, and Rea listened sitting on the floor by her shelves because her chair had become a far country. He said he had forgiven himself enough to write it down and then he had read it to another teacher and the woman had said, fair play, and he had cried in the car and the pig mask had fallen off the passenger seat and he had almost laughed himself into a ditch. He said Perrin had auditioned for a thing he did not quite understand and he had celebrated with a biscuit. He asked Rea whether she could recommend a biscuit for when the world’s edges got keen and she told him ginger because it bites you back kindly.

The press did their work with the professionalism of people who genuinely believe that making a metaphor for strangers is a public service. They did not call her a goblin because Rea had spent ten minutes in a corridor making sure that did not happen, and they did not call her an angel of death because no one had the energy. Somebody at a tabloid wrote Mouths Are For and then stopped because the sentence would have gone poorly for them either way. The minister returned to the algae to praise safeguarding in a suit that fought with his shoes. A woman who had once run a library wrote a blog about how inside voices had tricked a country into treating care like a luxury. A young man on a music forum made a playlist called Second Period and put on it all the songs that had saved him from handing his mouth over to someone else’s use.

Arthur found a man who owed him a favour at the lab and they pulled the last week from the camera’s card, the near-deleted together with the reluctant. There was the under-bridge flash and the gum constellations and Rea’s face in profile, caught when she thought she was only a shadow. There was Kian’s classroom doorway and the way children at the edges of the frame grew less blurry when the lens loved them. There was one image that caught the soft room’s glass and contained two women and a plant and the idea of a coin so present you almost saw it. There was also, buried deep, an old picture that had never belonged to their case: a boy in a school coach with a scarf across his mouth and bells that had begun as a joke and turned into a leash, his eyes looking out of the frame like someone who has decided to learn what power tastes like and then to dislike it forever. Rea stared at it until the rooms in her body rearranged themselves into an order she could live in for the rest of the day.

In court, the first hearing performed the ritual it had been instructed by centuries to perform, and everyone pretended not to be acting. Catalina stood at a single remove from her own body and every clerk’s pen. The charge read, the reply entered, the dates set, the sighs kept polite. Her solicitor’s hand was near enough that if Catalina had needed touch it could have been summoned without ceremony, and this was a form of civilization that didn’t fit into legislation and mattered anyway. The magistrate had a face that might have been kind if it had not processed so many days into product. Bail was not a question because the city had not yet remembered how to be brave. They remanded her, and Rea’s spine did the small private ache it always did when a woman was placed delicately into a box and told to wait inside her own life.

After, outside on the court steps where cameras do their main feeding, a woman shouted, “monster,” and the syllables sank in front of Catalina’s feet like stones in slow water. Rea did not stop walking and she did not turn and she did not believe in saints. She felt the coin in her pocket like an idea committing to circulation. She had written NOW over the box’s Not in thick pen before she left the flat, and when she got home she would put the coin in there because it had a job to do in the dark.

They allowed the plant into the remand wing and this would have been funny if it hadn’t been so dourly kind. A custody officer with eyebrows like suspect punctuation frowned at the pot and then softened, as if green had just reminded him of parks and he wished to be the sort of person who permitted them. Rea brought a cutting in a small cup the next day, in case anyone else had a cell that needed forgiving. The woman in the next room accepted it with a seriousness that revised the week.

Rea visited Miss Hamish’s class because closure is a word grown-ups like to use about children and it is almost never accurate. The new art teacher had hair in a brave arrangement and a voice that knew when not to be tidy. They had painted mouths that morning, not as roses or as warnings, but as doors. The children had written words under them that they wanted to hear and could not rely upon the world to provide. Thank you. Stay. Enough. A girl had painted an outline with thirteen unauthorised colours and named it Singing. A boy had written the word Jam and then edited it with a second pen to read Jam Today, and Rea had to pretend to rummage in a cupboard for a minute because some weeks a body that has been raised to behave prefers not to be watched while it does the mathematics of love.

In the evening her father called and said nothing for a while, just radio in the background and a spoon being placed on a saucer with the carefulness of a man who cannot bear more mistakes for a day. He said he had seen her on the news with a sternness she must have borrowed from her mother’s sister. He said, “you have your mother’s frown,” and she said, “yes,” and he said, “are you sleeping,” and she said, “in responsible instalments,” and he said, “I can come and fix the curtain rod,” and because the world is not all harm, she said yes and meant it.

The box marked NOW took the coin without complaint. It sat in there with old index cards that had done duty at bedsides, and a lanyard from a job whose heat had altered the fabric, and a sheet of paper that had become a map during a night she refused to let be called bad. She closed the lid and wrote another word on the cardboard on a whim and then left it because sometimes whim is the only honest tool you have. The word was Later and it was not a threat this time.

Catalina wrote letters that were not allowed to go anywhere yet, and the act did something to her shoulders that any doctor would recognise. She wrote to the caretaker who had sworn at three a.m. and then become a tenor by accident; she wrote to Miss Hamish’s mother, not to ask for forgiveness, because she had learned not to request such expensive things by post, but to describe the picture of the jam jar and the way light had been made to sit like a well-behaved guest at the table. She wrote to herself and folded that letter into the plant pot under a centimetre of soil, and the officer with the suspect eyebrows did not remove it because he had never been trained to police botany.

Arthur kept the camera in a locker that had held once a pair of boots that belonged to a man who could not stand anymore, and he checked it without a reason because sometimes you look at objects in case they have learned to disobey you. He stayed later than he meant to and found he did not resent it. He called the Crawley superintendent to tell her that the training they’d ignored last year would be offered again and this time he would attend, and he caught himself sounding pious and corrected by offering to bring biscuits himself. On the way out he passed a constable practicing saying sorry into a telephone recorder and decided to grant the world one free reprieve by not teasing him about it.

At the choir practice that had become church by stealth, Perrin sang beyond what he meant to, which is a form of practice you cannot buy. Kian stood at the back with his hands shoved into his pockets on purpose because a child had told him once that teachers with hands on hips look like Victorian villains. He called a boy’s answer beautiful without attaching a condition and nobody died of vagueness. After, he sat on the steps with a jam sandwich held in two hands like a thing you might bless and texted Rea an image so unremarkable most people would have swiped past it without stopping: five children putting chairs on tables, each using a different method that made sense to them, none being told it was wrong.

In the narrow hour, when a day makes its little bargain with the next, Rea sat at her table and read a report about cause that refused to use the word because and used instead a series of facts that the body could live with. She did not allow herself to be famously clever about the bit where women and men get named differently by harm. She wrote three questions for a training she had decided to deliver whether anyone had asked her to or not. What is your building’s under and who keeps it. Whose inside voice got bought cheap in your childhood and are you still paying for that bargain. Where in your room can a plant live, literally or otherwise, and why is it not there yet. She set them aside and went to brush her teeth with the radio telling a story about the way towns change their minds about statues when the weather touches them too often.

Sleep arrived the way it had all week, as a negotiator. Once, while she drifted, the city sent her a small gift by way of her phone vibrating itself awake. The image that resolved was poorly framed and more precious for being so. Not lips. Not a threat. A whiteboard in a staffroom with a goblin drawn badly guarding jam, and beneath it, a new sentence written in four different hands and underlined twice by someone who had enjoyed the pen: Talking is not a sin here. Bring your voice as it is. Someone had added, with a little arrow, Tuesdays are ours. It was nothing. It was everything. It was the sort of sentence a country could learn to live under without having to carry bells to prove they were behaving.
