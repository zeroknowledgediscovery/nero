On mornings when the light fell broken through the canopy like coins dropped into water, the city sounded like a choir of throats. Gibbons traded gossip from ropeway to ropeway; chimps bickered over bananas and voting blocs; orangutans moved with slow, certain grace through the upper markets, their arms like red banners. Even the announcements dove and swung, recorded hoots given civic authority and amplified through hollows that used to be trees and were now rooms.

Lio Ketter, who never learned to let a noise pass him without a rule to attach to it, walked along the lower deck with a sheaf of permits under his arm and the stray awareness of a man who knows too much and too many shopkeepers by name. He was thin, not young anymore, and not old enough to be safely ignored; he wore a sash that said he belonged to the tally office of Rainrut but also a face that said he belonged to nobody for long, because he would ask you, he would remind you to sign, he would lean in and know, always know something you wish he didn’t.

He loved it. He hated it. He moved in it like a fish in a tank and never forgot that the tank belonged to someone else.

Rainrut had been a belt of rich forest one hundred years ago; the trees were here still, turned by patient engineering into districts. After the Bloom, after the apes spread and filled, apes now outnumbered every other creature on the planet by a number that was like a fever dream. When you sat long enough and listened past the old cricket silence—you could almost remember the insect days, a thin sleet of sound—the conclusion crept into you: humanity had become a rumor. Swifts were counted, fish were counted, cattle counted, nothing counted like apes. They were number and law; they were administration and streets. They were clamor with names.

Lio’s nephew worked a stall named Radio Quiet. Not that there was any quiet to be found between his boxes of scavenged coils and cracked capacitors, his LED strings that glowed stubbornly in two colours even in the day. Davi, with his oil hair and quick hands, liked to solder. He liked to laugh at buyers. He liked to indulge Lio his meddling. That last made Lio’s days softer than they would have been.

“You’re late,” Davi called when Lio’s figure broke out of the milling and came to rest by the stall, where a tangle of extension cords nestled against a basket of bitter fruit. “No one has written you a complaint in at least six hours? Tragic. Come help me not sell anything.”

“You don’t have a permit for that basket,” Lio said out of habit, and when Davi rolled his eyes he added, “I have the form right here. Supply chain classification: produce, unregistered. You can be fined. Or—hear me—a simple signature and a stamp, and you’ll never think about it again.”

“I am thinking about it now because you are here,” Davi said. “Fill it out for me in that beautiful ink that belongs to a person who doesn’t actually own it. How much, Uncle?”

“For the stamp? A smile.”

“You’d bankrupt this city with your charity.”

Lio smiled, and the smile placed a wrinkle in his cheek that had started to live there lately. “You heard they’ll do the Branches next week?”

That took the lightness out of Davi’s mouth. He went ironic instead. “Ah yes. The Branches. I’ll hang little tins and bells like a fool, and the Chancellor will make his slow walk beneath, and every elder will swear he was heard.”

“His name is Aro Gaini,” Lio said softly. He had a small fondness for the Chancellor because you were allowed such fondness even here; the silverback had a careful reputation, an honest man in a thick world, and there were few of those and all of them were dangerous to admire. “He is honorable enough to have enemies on all sides.”

“Hoorah for honour,” Davi said without venom. “So, yes. The Branches. They chose us because—remind me.”

“They chose us,” Lio said, “because we are the hinge on the trade route. Because the ropeways meet here. Also because the cholera run last wet season went poorly, and he will point and say: see, we are here. That is the job of an honorable man. To point, to say.”

“Does he have a tail?”

“Chimps are not monkeys,” Lio and Davi chorused, then grinned. It was an old joke told at apes’ expense but safe only because chimps told it at everyone’s expense. The apes had become the joke you lived inside.

A bell clanged two decks above, a sound like something falling. Traders looked up; a troop of juveniles raced along a cable, dropping cloth pennants and laughter and juice peels. A municipal lemur—not an ape, not by far, but wearing an orange vest—wriggled through the railings and whistled. Lio completed Davi’s stamp with the practised flourish of a man who could stamp in his sleep, then leaned in across the stall.

“They wanted me at a meeting tonight,” he said.

“They,” Davi said carefully.

“You know the they. The human council. Or their tail. Someone in their tail.”

“Let them wag it without you.”

“I can’t,” Lio said, voice turning complicated, because in the soft politics of living, he did not like to say outright, I like to be in the room where things find words first. “I need to know. People will ask me what people are saying.”

“And you will know. You knowing makes knowing happen,” Davi said, always a step quicker than his own caution. He wasn’t mocking; he was describing Lio with the same tone he used to describe a radio when he had the back off. “Is this about Aro Gaini?”

“It might be about making him stop,” Lio said, and then felt ridiculous, because a man like him didn’t “stop” a silverback chancellor; a busybody nibbled the edges of a lunch and called it influence. But the message he had received was too heavy with intent to be mere complaining. The note had been tied to a nut and thrown at his window. It had said: if you have ever wanted to be more than a tally, come. We require a person whose curiosity is a muscle. Bring nobody. Don’t tell the trees.

Davi whistled, low. “And if I, your beloved nephew, counsel you to stay and drink tea and argue with me about circuits, will you listen?”

“No,” Lio said, with an apology that had no solution. “I can’t. It is an invitation I have been teaching myself to want for so long I don’t remember when I started.”

“Then wear shoes that won’t slip,” Davi said, which was as much blessing as he knew how to give. “And if you meet any honest men, spit in their soup.”

It started raining midafternoon, a warm slant that made the ropeways slick. The apes didn’t mind; they welcomed it and shook their fur and whooped. Humans pulled coats tighter. Lio went to the tally office and did his little work—the small fixed thing in his day that reminded him he belonged to a framework that kept most people alive most of the time—and the head clerk came over and placed a large hand on Lio’s head, exactly like an orangutan will place a palm on a sapling to teach the sapling who bends here.

“You hear the Branches,” the clerk said, without a question mark.

“I hear the Branches,” Lio said.

“You will hang bells.”

“I would be honoured,” he said, meaning it. It was something to stitch steel to rope. It was something to harmonize a city with tins.

The meeting was in the dry heart of an old trunk-house three decks below and up some uncertain stairs. The room was already noisy when Lio arrived. Two men and three women and a young person whose gender Lio did not try to name; the human council was never all in one place, never called itself that, and never stopped anyone from calling it worse. There were candled rinds and the stray smell of mushrooms. There was a bonobo sitting in the corner on a cushion as if he were a statue someone had moved indoors for the rain and left to watch, his face turned sideways to keep himself from casting too direct a gaze. His presence was the yes, you read right in the note: we can reach across. He wore no sash.

“You came,” said a woman with a waterfall of beads in her hair, no older than Lio and with less space between her eyebrows for worry. “This is Kasa. This is Pell. That one is Nyit. I am Saera.”

The bonobo inclined his head. “People call me Pell because my proper name requires a larynx with different credentials than yours. I am here under the most impeccable of reasons: curiosity.”

Lio’s mouth did a quick, uncontrollable smile. “The worst reason.”

“The best,” Pell corrected. “Because it can be satisfied.”

“We asked you,” Saera said, “because you walk both the ceiling and the floor of this place. You have face with apes. Your tallies are kept tidy enough that chimps make fun of you, which counts as respect. You have a nephew who sells lights to everyone without prejudice. Also—aim no offence here—you are nosy and fussy and cannot sit still when a wrong is near.”

“This is flattery,” Lio said. “Or recruitment. Or both.”

“Both,” Saera said, without the softening of a smile. “There is a thing that must be done during the Branches. We need you to do it.”

His heartbeat made small trees in his chest. “Who will be harmed?”

“The honorable,” Pell said, softly. “Aro Gaini will be harmed.”

The room leaned away from his words, like plants from fire. Lio felt the air get heavy immediately, as if a storm had pooled in the basin of the word honorable. He wanted to look for doors; instead he watched the candle in the rind.

“No,” Lio said, and then because he hated the flat, he added, “He is better than the next one.”

Saera nodded, because that was true and irrelevant. “But this Branches—if he makes the law we think he will, there will be census boxes that come with the rope collectors. There will be the off-tally. You know what that means. Used to be they took all boys of a certain weight—”

“I know,” Lio said, the words too fast. “I know.”

Off-tally: the sound of a life being counted in a different ledger, walled off, scooped away. In the exodus of species and the rising of minds, the ape city-states had learned to move people like water in and out of reservoirs. Nobody called it culling. To say, fewer mouths, to say, a better ratio. We will feed you, and also we will choose what kind of you to feed. In a city where apes counted like sand, humans were the few. The boxes would close and go downriver and you would not ask where because questions were like flint. They threw sparks.

Pell lifted a hand, tracing a circle in the air. “Allow the story to be large enough for it to hold us. The Chancellor is honourable. He is also about to erode the soft atom of your kind here. He will do it by opening a door called efficiency. We would prefer him not to open it.”

“You wish to assassinate him,” Lio said, and hated that he felt only very small about the plural suddenly. Hated that he had the capacity to accept a plan that would switch one man for another and call it making the world less sharp. “I don’t know how. I am not that man. Not even a little.”

Saera blew out a breath as if she, too, had been waiting for someone to say no. “We know you’re not. That’s why we asked you.”

Nyit, the young person with the big, bright eyes that had not yet been taught to narrow, slid forward and pushed something across the floor. It was a pouch made out of woven reed, sealed with wax.

Lio did not touch it.

“This is a carrier,” Saera said. “A thing that lives in your gut when you swallow it. It will not harm you in less than thirty days. In thirty one days you will be very unhappy and then perhaps dead, I’m sorry. But in the first thirty, it will listen to instructions and bloom when asked. If your mouth goes near Aro Gaini, if your breath passes him—he dies. It will like his body better than yours. That is what the inventors tell me.”

Inventors. Human minds playing dice with something as close to magic as made his palms sweat. He did not know where to set his eyes now; he set them on the bag and hated it for being small.

“The Branches brings him near to people,” Pell said. “He will speak in your street. He will pass below your bells. You will climb and hang tins. If you carry and cry his praise within a certain span, the carrier will decide that has been near enough. It makes a little pollen. It is a very modern way to push someone down.”

Lio looked directly at Pell then. “You are a bonobo advising me to kill a silverback. Is there not a law in your throat about that kind of treachery?”

“There is a law in my throat about hunger,” Pell said, and the curve of his mouth turned into something with teeth in it, grief teeth. “There is a law about children. We write new laws when old ones were made by those who counted themselves too much.”

“Besides,” Saera added, harsh and gentle all at once, “we will not ask this of you for free. We will free three families who you name from any boxes for two years. We will put your nephew beyond any ledger but his own. We will make your name heavy enough that rope collectors carry it carefully; I can do that. There is also something the bonobo offers that we could not. Right, Pell?”

Pell bowed. “The red corridors. Access to the hurt and the healing places. You could ask what you like. We could hand you a key no human council in this city has held. You help cut a tree, you get wood.”

The rain suddenly increased, a hiss along the bark that sounded like enormous breathing.

Lio did not touch the bag because touching would be a promise and he was afraid of how quick a promise could settle inside him and become his idea. He did not ask why me repeatedly because they had already told him and the answers were flattering enough to be a poison. He thought about Davi. That hurt in the soft place he never spoke aloud. He thought about little Lem, who was no relation, who had his face always turned to the sky because every cable was a promise and he loved them so. He thought about how many boxes, how many—and then he forced his mind to trip on something smaller—how many his hand could make not happen. He wasn’t good with grand numbers; he was very good with small ones. Individuals, not sums.

He said, because in the end he always came back to this, “There is no way this kind of act goes clean. Nothing goes clean.”

Saera made a face that might have been a smile. “Nothing goes clean,” she agreed. “We tidy what we can. We will wash the floor when you are gone, even. You see? We are pragmatic.”

“How many honest men have you envied?” Pell asked softly, not looking at him. “How many times have you thought, if I could just touch the string that moves their hands—now can be the one time.”

Lio took the bag. He could not feel weight in it. He could not feel anything except the racing little animals that were always in his blood when he was near the center of something. He slipped it into the inside of his jacket, near his sternum, where perhaps it could hear his heart. The absurdity almost made him laugh; he hiccuped instead.

“Is there more,” he said, “that I should know.”

Saera glanced at the others. “Yes,” she said, and then didn’t find the exact place for her mouth to go. “This is not the first attempt. We had something else in design. We don’t need it now, if this works. But I tell you because secrets breed the worst children. We thought to use kin law.”

Lio looked up, wary. “Kin law.”

Pell picked at the fine hair on his wrist, gaze gone to some distant branch. “Ape law, not mine, not exactly—not as I would have written it if I wrote, but we inherit our tongues. There is a baroque tangle of rituals that govern who can approach and how they become allowed to be near. One—I’ll be brief—went like this: a man proves his trustworthiness to the group by placing their blood above his own. He takes something of his family into him at risk, to show that he will not betray when asked to choose between his kin and the larger tree.”

Saera’s voice had gone flat. “We had a plan that would let you approach with that kind of mark on you. It requires a... sacrifice of the sort we do not wish to require of anyone, ever. Forgive me. The idea was on the table, and I sweep it off now that we have another. But it existed, and people—there are people in rooms who like this kind of tradition. They are not good rooms.”

Lio’s brain caught up with her words as if it were running and tripped and hit the flagstones. He had the image, sudden and precise, of Davi’s hand holding a halved orange. He had the image of that hand without the orange. He had the idiot thought: assasinate is spelled with two s. He had the adult thought: I can’t do it. I won’t. His mouth did not even open to say it.

“Not this,” he said, barely, and shook his head and shook it again. “You say it like a hypothetical, Saera. Make it stay that way.”

“It stays that way,” Saera said urgently, leaning in, eyes fierce with the truth of it. “If this works. I swear it. If this works. We will not ask anyone to—no. If it doesn’t, we will be torn by hunger and by those who scream loudest. If it doesn’t, I cannot guarantee anything that other hands might not do. So make this work and close that door.”

Lio traced the rim of the candle with a fingertip until wax warmed his skin. He nodded. He did not trust that the door would stay closed for all time, but he could sit in front of it now, at least, hands braced against it. He understood leverage. He understood specific times when you could be bigger than yourself the way a stick is big if you put it under a rock.

“Tell me how to train it,” he said, indicating the bag with a jerk of his chin. It was easier to talk about a thing with instruction. It was easier to list.

Nyit smiled with relief. “We teach it the shape of a name. If you speak in a certain pattern while it dissolves, it keeps that shape near, and when it finds that shape in the air again, it opens.”

“Names are air,” Pell said softly. “We are all very easy to unhouse.”

They taught him a word, which was not exactly Aro Gaini because nothing was allowed to be exactly anything. They taught him how to slow his throat. He practised until his voice sounded as if it had pebbles in it. It was all surreal and greasy. Lio’s mouth dried. He made a sound like the word and the candle wobbled and nothing changed and he thought: good. Let nothing change. Then he thought: coward.

When Lio stood to go, the bag light against his ribs, Saera tugged his sleeve. “We mean it about your nephew. If you want him clear of all ropes, he is clear. Say.”

“I want him here,” Lio said, shocking himself with the stubbornness of it. “Not in a box, not in the air, not in a story. Here. Selling bad parts to good people. Laughing at me.”

“Then you protect this city for him,” Saera said, and there was no scorn in it, only a tempered hope. “We all make our sanctuaries. Maybe this is one. Ugly as a sanctuary can be.”

He went out into the rain that had become a mist and hung there like the city was being breathed by a giant. Lio took the long rope across because it let him be a body not a mind for a moment; he put his feet in the knots and counted, left right left right, and the rhythm pushed everything else briefly quiet.

That night he did not sleep. He placed the pouch on the table and looked at it until its presence felt ordinary. He boiled water and cooled it and boiled it again, as if purifying the city’s poor pipes would purify anything else. He walked to the window and opened it and let in bat-wings of cool. He wrote a letter that started, Davi, I have done something ugly because I love you, and he tore it up and ate the pieces because that seemed like a magic that would keep the letter from existing in the memory of paper. He thought of the red corridors Pell had promised—places in the ape quarters where humans never went, rooms with devices that could heal—or break—and of the way Pel had said hunger and children. He tried on the words in his mouth: honorable man. He looked at himself in the tin mirror and did not like what his mouth looked like when it tried to say it.

Morning arrived with birdless quiet and a fog of cooking. He took the bag, and he said the shape of the name the way they taught him, and he put it in his mouth and swallowed and nearly gagged and swallowed again until it was gone, gone, as simple as that. A thing had moved into him. He apologized to his body without words. He waited and nothing happened, which is to say he could breathe. He tasted nothing, or perhaps he tasted rind, a bitterness where sweetness would have been kinder.

He went to the stall. Davi was assembling a coil and humming a song that had no repeat. Lio felt a wild urge to tell him everything—loudly, with numerous interruptions, with lists—but the room in his body where secrets went had already been rented and sealed and was now paying him in stomachs of ice.

“Uncle,” Davi said, then stopped, then peered at him as if Lio were a radio he suspected of not being entirely on the correct station. “You look like you chewed a battery.”

“Bad tea,” Lio said, and then reached over and took a fruit from the basket of bitter and bit it and let the pucker hit him hard, so his face would have an alibi.

They hung the bells all that day and on into the next. The Branches were a choreography that had been improved upon, codified, danced between species. Humans did the delicate placements; orangutans anchored with slow, strong hands; chimps decided the order and refused to be contradicted except when they were, loudly, for sport; gibbons sang. Children chased bells and adults caught children. Aro Gaini would walk here. His long arm would brush the metal. He would speak and his voice would wrap around the green and tell everyone that the tightening was good for them, that eight mouths fed well were better than ten thin ones, that this was math and mathematics did not love or hate, it counted and reached.

“See,” Davi said, when they paused for breath and sat on a plank above the stall and watched the sagging and the shining. “You didn’t even have to spit in any soup to make it good.”

“Negotiations remain ongoing,” Lio said, dry.

The city felt like it held its breath for three days. Word-of-mouth ripened; the ropeways were strung with children and drums. The ancestral songs came around twice. It was the old way for a new number: apes now in every direction. Humans in the between places. Names called out, long and complicated and loving. The fog lifted. The chandeliers of leaves shivered in wind and belief.

When the morning came, the morning when the silverback would step onto the main sway and make the city thoughtful, Lio woke with his heart already in his throat, using his mouth as a room to wait in. He said the shape of the name once, under his breath. He said it again, without wanting to, because repetition feels like positioning yourself on a cliff. You do it in tiny steps, hoping a bird will take the choice from you. He tightened the bell with fingers that wanted to be somewhere else. He caught Davi’s eye and the whole world tilted into the shape of a young man’s grin.

Somewhere above, someone dropped something; a practised hand caught it. Somewhere below, a pan burned and someone laughed about it. The great body of Rainrut breathed like a sleeping animal and then woke, all at once, in the old chorus that meant an important foot had touched a length of wood. The air changed, hot with attention.

Aro Gaini was not yet visible. He was a ripple of sound first, the voice working ahead of him, a careful rumble that made even Lio’s bones behave. The silverback had a way with calling people to stillness. He did not need amplification. His chest was its own bell.

“Rainrut,” the voice came, threading through leaves and metal, “you carry yourselves well.”

Lio went cold and then hot. He could feel his breath. He could feel, absurdly, the bag that was not a bag now, whatever it had become, listening to the air for the shape of the name.

Davi leaned in. “Don’t forget to breathe. Also don’t fall off the world.”

“I’m very busy not doing both,” Lio said.

The Chancellor came into view as if someone had pulled him from clear water. He was heavier than sound suggested, thick with muscle and authority and an old scar that ran from his left shoulder into his fur. He walked as if gravity were a friend he consulted regularly. He was flanked by two chimps wearing ceremonial belts that glittered with old human coins. He passed under a first drift of bells, and the bells made small sharp rain of sound. The city answered with its throat. He smiled, or what apes do when their faces soften, their eyes easing. In that moment Lio believed again what he had been told and feared: that Aro Gaini was an honorable man, which made everything worse, which made it all so much heavier and so much thinner.

There was a moment then, a breath before a word, when Lio could have closed his mouth and stepped back and maybe lived and maybe also allowed a series of boxes to be made anew. There was a moment when he felt the edges of the bag thing inside him stir like something in a very small cage choosing to stand. He opened his mouth, not to speak, not to call the shape of the name, just to let air out, because his lungs demanded it.

Davi’s hand touched his sleeve. “You alright?”

“Yes,” Lio said, and the carrier—like all obedient animals—heard the yes as something else entirely. He watched Aro Gaini look up. He watched the Chancellor put a palm on a knot of rope as if greeting an acquaintance. He watched the bells and the faces and his own hands as if they were not entirely his.

When the wind changed, when it pushed the Chancellor’s voice toward him and pulled Lio’s breath toward the Chancellor, it felt like a simple thing. Like the city breathing the other way.

And then far below, a shout tore through the morning, raw, not ceremonial at all. A human voice. Several. Lio looked down and his vision went narrow. Men in orange were pushing through the market in a disciplined rush that meant collectors. Boxmen. Early.

“It wasn’t supposed to be now,” Saera had said. “After. After.”

The boxmen came like a blunt instrument into a song, and the song faltered. Even Aro Gaini’s throat stuttered. Lio made a decision then that felt like falling forward and also like stopping. He moved along the plank toward the next tie, toward the rope ladder, heart making its own language. Davi swore and followed. The city read their motion and tilted slightly to accommodate.

Aro Gaini raised his hand, the gesture that called chimps to wait. He looked down into the spill. He began to speak the thing leaders say to make the instrument play in the key of courtesy again. He would have. He was capable. He was honorable; he was good at this.

Lio placed his foot on the ladder and began to descend into the old muscles of his city while holding in his mouth the name that could empty it of one man.

The boxmen reached the first stall. They touched a child by the scruff and then softer at the arm, a practiced false gentleness that hurt more. The child was small and did not know about rituals and did not give the instrument what it asked for; he screamed. The chimps tensed. The bonobos went danger-still. Lio could see people moving toward the incident with the inevitability of a river seeking its shape. He climbed harder. His lungs burned. His mouth tasted like rind and metal and something else, a faint spice. A taste like a door.

He didn’t know, not then, that this morning he would be presented with a different, uglier door than the one he had been given in that trunk-house. He didn’t know it had a name yet, or that names can be knives. He didn’t know he would be asked, soon, to do a thing that would require him to swallow not just a pouch but the only person who ever laughed him into being better. The world was still one door at a time. He moved toward the one he could see, which was the one with a child at the center and a powerful man above and something in his body listening for a syllable that would build a death.

“Uncle,” Davi said, and Lio turned his head for a heartbeat toward that sound, and in that piece of time the silverback above them finally made the gesture that called the chimps outward like muscle. The bell-lines swayed. The people below wavered.

Lio, who had made himself into a busy body and a hinge and a man who counted for a living, stepped down into the noise, carrying in his gut both a future and a failure and the faintest possible hope that when a person is asked to hold more than they can, some fraction of it spills into good. He opened his mouth—only to breathe, he would always tell himself later, only to breathe—and the city held its breath back, and the word that had no name in any of the languages he spoke began to move between his teeth.The word wanted out of him the way a swallowed seed wants dirt, patient and entirely without morality, and Lio discovered that he could bully even his own breath when he had to. He turned his head and made his mouth full of other sounds, the rough grunt that meant excuse me in rope-crowd and the hoarse shout that meant make way; he said Davi first, because that was the shape his throat trusted most, and the carrier inside him leaned forward like an animal at a window and then, not hearing its taught name, sat back to watch. He went down, down, his hands slick against hemp and his shoes a scuffing rhythm, and the bells lilted above like rain translated into tin.

The boxmen were not the river’s usual clumsy thugs with their poor uniforms and their posture that told the truth about whose orders had weight; these wore new orange vests cut neatly and stamped with a crest that meant they belonged to the rope inspection office. That bad arithmetic made the crowd more frightened, because nothing unsettles a city like seeing the wrong branch of authority take an interest in your body. They had boxes on handcarts, narrow and tall, with slats dressed up as ventilation, and they had a woman at their front carrying a ledger and a stamp so large it could have been used to flatten bread. The first child they reached had been heading to a swing lesson and had a strip of cloth on one wrist to say so; the woman did not look at the strip and wrote the child’s name without asking, and the child went still and then wild in the same breath. The mother put a hand to the child’s head, as if to grow a second skull over it with pressure.

Lio arrived with the certainty, which sits at the back of the nose, that any word he let out could be the word that cut the Chancellor’s life, and he hated the symmetry of that with the way words always did too much when he used them. He wedged his body between the handcart and the mother, and he put both palms up and said, please, please, this looks wrong. He didn’t say unlawful, because apes and humans used that word differently in their blood, and he didn’t say stop, because stop is a trigger word in any throat. He said, this is a parade. He said, this is a market. He said, this is not the time. He said it in the pattern that reminded polite people of being small and being told to go around through the back way.

One of the chimps at Aro Gaini’s side had moved without being told, the instinctive surge of a bodyguard whose muscles turned information into physics, and a sweep went through the line of belts as other chimps set their weight on different parts of the wood. Gibbons began to pour sound over the scene, loud and bright and deliberately silly, the song that meant look, everyone, we can be distracted, nothing to see here, which apes and humans alike understood as a courtesy rather than a lie. A municipal lemur Lio recognized made eye contact with him, whiskers twitching to say, if you can buy me ten seconds, I can make a nuisance.

Aro Gaini watched. He had the face of a patient teacher and the body of a rock you could live under, and there was a moment when Lio knew that if he tried to shape the name now, the pollen would prefer the Chancellor’s lungs over any other lungs nearby, the way a fine powder will prefer a cloth napkin to a stone. He felt the carrier stir again when he filled his mouth with air to say, no, stop, don’t. It coiled back when he came out with, clerk, please, the inspection of ropes does not include the counting of children. He made it sound like he was quoting from a manual, which was a voice rope inspectors believed in more than they believed in gods.

The woman with the stamp glanced up then, annoyance flashing and then smoothing into official calm, because she had been chosen for this job partly because she could go very smooth. “Emergency measure,” she said, and her hand went to the stamp unconsciously as if to prove she had an object and thus had a reason. “Water-borne risk, human densities. We must compile a list for distribution. The Council approves. The Chancellor approves.”

“The Chancellor is about to speak,” Lio said, careful not to make it question or challenge, statement only, a scaffold he hoped she would rest on. “He will prefer to do so without numbers being taken below the sound of his voice. He will prefer appearance. Leave the boxes here, if you like. Let him call you to your task after he has called our city to its duty.”

The woman’s eyes flickered toward the silverback on the sway, a reflexive checking of weather, and Lio heard a noise in his own head that could have been triumph or could have been the carrier making a minuscule adjustment to its position. Davi was at his shoulder, breathing like a bellows, coil in one hand as if a copper spring could be a weapon if you believed hard enough. He did not look at Lio’s mouth. He looked past Lio at the child and made his voice stupidly pleasant and said, hey, little frog, you want to hold a special wire for me that hums a very quiet song. The child, who had stopped screaming because breathing had insisted upon its rights, nodded because Davi’s face had always been a temporary shelter for children. Davi put the coil in the child’s hands and showed him the trick of catching its end with a little rubber hook and then pretended to be very impressed. The boxmen could not put a child into a tally while a child was doing a job; even among the ape bureaucracies there were rules about that. Lio hated how immediately he used that rule and filed the hatred away for later.

Aro Gaini raised his hand and did the thing that leaders do who have learned the old shapes of moving bodies that are not their own. He spoke not to the crowd but to a point above their heads, so that they would all lift their faces and thus be less inclined to shove. “Rainrut,” he called, and his mouth made soft the last syllable so that it was not a rut but a root, a small intentional music. “We do not count in fear. That is bad mathematics.” He let that sit, and then added, with a politician’s clean cruelty, “We count with our hands in plain sight.”

The woman with the stamp froze her stamp midair and then lowered it like a contraband. She bowed her head in a way that could be read as obedience or could be read as we will do this later and it will be worse then. Lio saw both readings travel through the ropeways like opposing breezes. The chimps untensed; the gibbons pivoted into triumph without moving their feet. The lemur, having found no way to be necessary, performed a small comic fall for the sake of decency.

Lio realized he had been holding not just a breath but a shape, and he deliberately broke it into pieces by coughing twice. The second cough was the one that felt strange, like dust the size of an idea in his throat. He turned his head hard toward the market smoke and let it carry whatever fragment of the carrier had been enticed by the almost-name into the air, where it would find a less precise place to land. A bonobo on a high beam rubbed his nose and sneezed delicately into his own fur, and nothing else remarkable happened, which is its own kind of miracle if you count such things.

The Chancellor finished his gesture. He spoke about the cholera and about the previous year when the rope routes had carried fever quickly where they were meant to carry fruit, and he made the city listen with the hard-earned trick of speaking about small specific things. He said numbers but he also said names. He named the water-keepers in three districts, and he thanked a woman Lio had seen carrying buckets her whole life. He announced, when he had his fulcrum exactly where he wanted it, a new system of apprenticeships that would make it easier for human youths to be counted not as mouths but hands. Lio recognized the euphemism like an old enemy seen under new light. The boxes were not to be called boxes; they would be “houses of learning” by river towns, with ropes that were not one-way ropes at all, oh no. He kept listening anyway, because disliking a word is not the same as knowing its weight.

When it was done, the bells had been rung in the proper order and the tins had flashed, and the people of Rainrut had done the decent thing and taken the best possible reading of the music they had been played. The boxmen left their carts where they were and stepped back, eyes on their leader’s face rather than on the Chancellor’s, and Lio watched their mouths as if there might be letters there he could pocket. The child with the coil went from feral to proud in the space of twelve heartbeats and then asked Davi for a second job. Davi taught him how to tie off a wire with a flourish as if the flourish mattered, which it does.

After, the city got on with being a city because that is the first job of any body of people that intends to keep existing: you go back to the making and the trading and the particular cruelties and kindnesses of ordinary time. Lio put his palms on his knees while sitting on a plank and breathed in a way that had nothing to do with the carrier and everything to do with convincing his heart that it was not a small bird trapped in a tin cup. He felt a presence and did not have to look to know who it was, because some bodies bend a room in a specific set of angles.

Pell sat down beside him with the attentiveness of an animal that has made a decision to be in a human’s space when he did not need to be. He did not speak immediately, which was civility; he let the city fill up the pauses he was owed. When he did, it was with the same voice he had used when he had told Lio that curiosity was satisfied or else it is only hunger pretending to be something else. “That was interesting,” he said, and then added, “You did not do it.”

“No,” Lio said, and let his face be blank long enough that a little part of his self could dart out from under it and not be seen. “I did something else with my mouth. I cannot feel proud about it yet. Maybe later when I am telling the story to myself badly.”

Pell made the sound bonobos make that means they are not going to show their teeth and they are not going to look away either. “You tasted it.”

“I coughed,” Lio said, and because there is no point in hiding from a mind that is already sitting on the same plank as yours, he added, “It moved. I felt it want. I do not like to think of myself as a man who has to guard against his own breath.”

“Welcome to having language,” Pell said. “We put our lives in our mouths and then we surprise ourselves at what comes out.”

They were interrupted by Saera, whose beads were dull now with the dust of the morning and whose eyes had the noise of a person who has kept two or three kinds of trouble from colliding by standing between them and leaning very hard. She took Lio’s wrist and then let it go, as if she remembered that he was not hers to move. “The room,” she said, meaning the room she never named, “is a storm. They say you had the Chancellor’s name in your throat and you chose to use it as a leash for a clerk. They say this was cowardice dressed in a new sash.”

“They can say,” Lio said, too tired to sharpen irony around the words. “They were not the ones with the animal in their chest and the wrong wind.”

Saera’s mouth did something complicated and then settled into something simple. “They are moving,” she said, and she did not have to say moving where. “They are pulling kin law back onto the table with their angry hands. That door did not stay closed just because you sat in front of it. If we cannot cut a powerful man gently, they will cut him with a spectacle. They will put a law in your throat that says you cannot come near unless you carry your blood’s pain with you. They will make that legal, and once it is legal we will not know how to bury it deep enough.”

The plank felt soft under Lio’s palms in the way rotten wood does before it fails. He wanted to be horrified, but horror is luxurious and requires time; he had only to sort what he could move. “Tell them I am not finished,” he said. “It was a bad wind and a bell too close to my mouth and a clerk with a stamp. Tell them I will find a better breath. Tell them I—” He stopped because telling people that he would kill a decent man later when he could do it cleanly was a sentence he could not put his name beneath in ink.

Pell saved him by being pragmatic. “There is another branch that can be cut without taking down the whole canopy.” He leaned closer, and Lio could smell the faint fruit sweetness that bonobo fur carries when it has been recently groomed and had not yet met the day’s dirt. “The boxes are built. They will go by river. The red corridors are not only operating rooms; they are also the routes where goods travel without questions. I can give you a key to a place where you can turn the boxes into other boxes. Empty ones. They go down full of air and come back full of clatter. In between they meet a small quiet that looks like an accident.”

Lio had to look at him then because of the word key. He was not very good at refusing keys. “What would that cost. Not the price. The cost.”

Pell’s mouth folded into a shape that meant he liked and disliked that question in equal measure. “The cost is that you will go into the corridors that are red for reasons besides paint and you will come out smelling like something people will sense even if they cannot name. You will become this kind of man more than you already are. You will learn how much of the city is cloth over bone and you will know where the cloth tears easily. Once you know that, you will touch fabric more carefully and more often. You will be someone’s necessary liar.”

Saera’s beads made a small, impatient sound against each other. “Now is not the day to be polite to choices,” she said. “Say yes and go. Or say no and I will be obliged to tell the room exactly what you did not do, and the room will hunt something that looks like justice and tastes like kin. They have a boy prepared to be brave. He thinks he will become holy. He is a child and he will become a wound instead.”

Lio thought of Davi’s hand holding orange and the other image that had replaced it, the one he had refused and had to refuse again like an animal he pushed out of his house each night when it came scratching. He thought of the carrier in his gut, a time bomb with a polite face, and he thought of the boxes and the way wood can suggest inevitability when stacked properly. He thought of Aro Gaini’s voice saying mathematics without hate. He looked at Pell and said, because there are times when one becomes the person others already think you are for a practical reason, “Give me the key.”

The bonobo took from his sash a narrow strip of woven copper that looked like the prettiest length of nothing Lio had ever seen. He slid it into Lio’s palm, and where it touched skin Lio felt the faintest hum, as if a song was being sung very far away in a room he had once lived in. Pell tapped Lio’s knuckle with a finger that had a backwards story written in its scar. “Go two decks down and take the path between the oil-press and the room where the skinning happens. There is a door with seven nails and one missing. Show this like you were born with it. Do not show fear. The man with soft eyes will let you in. Tell him I sent you to trade three full boxes for white mushrooms.”

Davi had been listening, because of course he had, because listening is what he does the same way making lists is what Lio does. He made a face that suggested that the idea of letting boxes go downriver empty delighted him as a puzzle while also making him want to be sick as a human. “I am coming,” he said, in the tone of voice you use when you inform the weather of your plans. “Do not say any noble words at me, do not tell me I am safer here, do not tell me I am young and luminous. I am coming and if you want to fight me about it you will have to explain to the man with soft eyes why my face is bruised and your face is not.”

Lio opened his mouth and the carrier leaned forward and he closed his mouth again. He looked at Saera instead of Davi and said, “Call off your kin-law room for a day. Tell them a work is in progress. Tell them you have put my hand on a lever and if they break it I will take my hand away and then they will have one fewer thing to blame when they cannot stand what they have done.”

Saera took that and tucked it somewhere in the mechanism of her that made decisions. She nodded once. “You have a day,” she said. “And if the day breaks, something under it breaks with it. This is not a threat. It is a weather report.”

They went. The oil-press made the air feel like a warm tongue and the skinning room smelled exactly like the middle of a lie. The door with seven nails and one missing showed itself after an accident of smoke; it looked like nothing because it was supposed to look like nothing. Lio held up the copper strip as if he had found it in his pocket by mistake and was mildly pleased by its existence. He did not let his eyes sharpen too much. The man with soft eyes opened the door and looked at the copper and then at Lio’s mouth and then at Davi’s hands and made a decision that would change a river.

Inside the red corridor it was night without stars. The red light was not angry; it was merely honest about what it illuminated. Men and apes moved in quiet ways that you learn when you know that sound can be currency as well as warning. Boxes sat like obedient children. They were built cleverly so that they could be one thing until they were turned and then another. Lio saw at once three points where a small change would become a cascade. He put his fingers there mentally and turned. He discovered, belatedly, that he had been designed for this kind of work and just never given access to the room.

They showed him, because Pell had sent the copper, where the papers were rewritten between first stamp and second, and where a name became a number and then slid off ink entirely. They showed him how to make a box become a bin with the addition of two nails and one rope cut. Davi wandered the edges and put his hand on everything and whispered to each piece of metal until it told him its favorite story. Lio had never loved anyone more than he loved Davi in that moment when Davi turned a latch and made a lock believe it had decided to open itself.

“White mushrooms,” Lio said to the soft-eyed man, because even thieves have to like their metaphors clean sometimes. “Three full, coming back empty.”

The man put his hand on one of the boxes the way a person who makes bread puts their hand on dough to judge bounce back. He looked up at Lio with the glance of someone who has made peace with the fact that he works in a place where the city hides things it is ashamed to say out loud. “If one gets weighed on the river,” he said, “the numbers will look wrong. They will not be wildly wrong, but the men who count can smell wrongness two fingers away. You have to give them something to measure. They do not care what, but it must be countable.”

Davi was already in the corner where scrap lived. He came back with coils, copper and tin, and some dead radios, and a collection of old coins chimps liked to polish for their belts. “These are heavy and make a nice clink,” he said, pragmatism and mischief about equal in his mouth. “We are going to teach the river to listen to the wrong song and be proud of recognizing it.”

They packed three boxes like people who had done it before and would do it again. Lio put his hands on slats and found the rhythm of the men who had built them, learned the language of their joints. He watched the red corridor move around him and tried not to memorize too much, knowing that his mind was a snag that held onto too much string. He told himself it was good, it was fine, he was allowed to know this level of his city. He felt in his stomach the quiet animal that had chosen to live there and he made a pact with it, brief and unworthy, that if it would let him do this right he would not throw it into that other man’s chest unless the world fell like rope cut with a bad knife.

They took the boxes out like a rehearsal. No fuss. No whistle. No songs. The red corridor swallowed behind them as if it had never made a man into a lever. When they reached light that was not red, Lio almost laughed with the relief of color and then did not because laughter is loud and he liked the feel of being small inside a plan that did not care for applause.

By night, the river sang its old work-song. The boxes slipped into the dark with their bellies full of clatter, and if the men at the weighing post thought the numbers were strange, they did not think they were dangerous. Downriver the “houses of learning” would be ready with their gentle signs and the beds that smelled of boiled cloth. When the lids lifted there, three times in three places, nothing would climb out, and someone who had been expecting a number of names would have to go find new names to match their counts. If you force a counter to count differently enough times, they begin to suspect that their numbers are not gods.

Lio went home with Davi across a rope that could have broken but did not. He ought to have been too full of adrenaline for speech, but the night gentled him, and the hum of Davi’s tired body beside him was a lullaby he had lived on since he had first taught the boy to solder and not to lick his fingers after. He did not sleep after he lay down; he only visited the edge of it and sat there with his feet in. He thought again of the word that had no name and the way it had moved in his mouth and he wondered whether all languages begin with an almost and a cough.

The morning did not permit a long hang between before and after. Saera came with eyes like she had read every argument and found all of them boring. She told him that the room had not howled because choir practice had been moved to late afternoon. She told him he had bought hours. She told him he was now useful to people who wanted to use him for clean and dirty work alike. She leaned in, braced her hands on her knees, and she said a thing she had saved for this moment or a moment like it. “They are going to ask you,” she said. “Not me. Not Pell. Not anyone who knows where to stand when a rope is coiled. You. They are going to ask you to make kin law true by volunteering it and calling it beautiful. They are going to ask you for your nephew. They will say he can be the emblem. They have already decided that if you put your own on the altar, you can walk the red corridors forever with keys and they will not make a sound. They are trying to sell you your dignity by the pound.”

Lio had expected it in the way you expect storms in a season when storms happen, and still it hit like falling through one rung of a ladder and catching yourself on the next. He did not perform a speech of outrage because that would have been a luxury and he liked Davi too much to waste any breath in the expensive words. He said, “No,” in a tone that had no room for explanation, and he watched Saera’s face take that no and slot it contemptuously into a place where she could work with it.

“I will keep them away until the sun goes into the belly of that tree,” she said, picking a bough old enough to have a name everyone used. “Then I run out of names to call my postponements. Make your other work do more than scare them. Make it change how the boxes look in the mouth of the river. Make people laugh at the wrong men. Nothing unmans a zealot like laughter. If laughter fails, promise them an uglier story if they do the pretty one. Everyone thinks they like beauty; most are cowards about what makes it.”

Davi had been under the counter, looking for a capacitor he liked the color of, and he came up slowly because he had been listening and he didn’t yet know what to do with his hands. He put one on Lio’s shoulder and one on the counter, balanced between the person and the world. “If they ask me,” he said lightly, as if trying on a coat he had no intention of buying, “I will say no so loud that your carrier hears me.”

“They will not ask you,” Lio said. “They will ask me for you. They will tell me it is love to say yes. They will tell me I can be father and mother to a whole neighborhood of boys with that one no-yes. They will give me the kind of arithmetic that gives the wrong answer with the right smile.”

Davi squeezed and then he laughed, which was not disrespect but ritual. “Uncle,” he said, “you have always liked putting names on the noises that bother you. Call this one what it is. Not kin law. Not tradition. Not hunger or math. Call it theft. Then you will remember how you know how to stop theft with forms and stamps and a clerk who pretends to care about ink getting on his fingers.”

The city, which had recently been a choir and then a courtroom and then a corridor, decided to be a workshop for a while. Lio put his mind there, because minds are tools that rust if they stay out in the weather too long. He went to the tally office and found three tallies gone strange in the way that means someone is hiding a change under paperwork. He traced them back to the rope inspection office by way of a transfer slip that had a flourish he recognized from the woman with the stamp. He wrote a form and then another and then he delivered the second to the wrong office on purpose, where it would be read and tutted at and then passed, with a different color clip, to the right office, where it would now be interesting because it had been seen in the wrong place first. He did that trick twice. He made a chain of small errors that would snag big intentions.

Pell arrived at noon with fruit neither of them could afford to eat without pretending it had been a gift from a generous ape who had read an ancient proverb. He took a slow bite and then said, “The river has sent back a letter in numbers. One man who counts has gone to his boss with a frown like a thunderhead. We have weather. Some is yours. Some is mine. Some is luck. I will stand next to you for two hours, and then I must go be a different kind of man elsewhere. During those hours if someone comes with tradition in their mouth, I will show them my teeth and my child and my hunger and I will ask them about math.”

In the late afternoon, the room that Saera never named sent a boy with swift feet and a throat like a drum to say that the vote was in a pile, and the pile had more stones on the side of kin than on the side of clean assassination. He said it like he was telling them the weather, which meant he understood his job and would not try to convince them of anything. He looked at Davi with his immense, earnest eyes and then away, because his eyes had not yet learned how to be knives. Lio gave him a piece of copper wire for his pocket because he had to give the boy something and all he had just then was wire.

He thought then, more fiercely than he had let himself before, about Aro Gaini’s face. Not the features—those were obvious and had nothing to do with anything—but the way he had put his voice in the city that morning. He asked himself if he could go put the un-name in his throat while everything inside him had now become a series of barricades. He asked himself which door he was standing in front of now and whether the people coming toward it had torches or petitions. He counted to ten with whatever part of himself had not been rented out to anyone else yet and he decided on something that made him stand up so abruptly that Davi lifted his hands as if to catch him.

“I’m going to talk to him,” Lio said, and watched Pell flinch in a way that was mostly eyes and only a little fingers. “Not in public. Not as a petitioner. Not as a man with an unname in his belly. As a clerk with a bag of forms. I will talk to him about numbers while meaning other words, and I will find out if there is anything in him that wants not to be killed by me. If there is not, then I will learn the shape of the absence. If there is, then perhaps we do not have to cut this tree at all; perhaps we can turn it. You told me once a lever can move the world if it has a place to stand. Perhaps Aro Gaini will be that place by accident.”

Pell rubbed his brow as if smoothing fur that was not there. “You will not get close,” he said. “Not now. Not after boxes tried to come early and red corridors went the wrong color.”

“I am a tally,” Lio said, and made the word proud without liking to. “Tallies can always get halfway into any room. The trick will be getting the rest of the way.”

Davi grinned with more nerves than joy and then found joy under the nerves like a toy under a blanket. “If they turn you away at the door,” he said, “tell them you have brought forms and a stamp that flattens bread.”

“Bring the copper strip,” Pell advised, in a voice that made advice into a gift. “Sometimes things that open one door open another. Sometimes they cannot bear to stop being keys.”

They went at dusk, when a city looks its truest, with smoke and light fighting on surfaces and children being called in and not listening and apes making the sound that means the day has been counted and there are exactly as many bodies alive as needed to believe this could continue. Lio had the copper in his sleeve and the carrier in his gut and a stack of forms that were real forms about real problems because he did not know how to carry fake forms; his body refused them like bad meat. He made his face into the one people were used to when he was going to ask them to sign something they did not want to sign, a face that said I love this city more than I love your comfort. He asked to be announced and he used the title he had never said aloud because it sat crooked on his tongue: liaison, human. He watched the chimp with the belt of coins taste the word and find it interesting enough to put away.

They sat on a bench in a hall that had been a trunk once and then a room and now used lighting cleverly so that it felt like both, and Lio felt Davi’s knee bump his and bump back. He told himself, like a prayer or a list, we are here to move a lever, we are here to move a lever. He told himself to keep his breath like a coin under his tongue. He told himself not to think of the room with stones piled on one side and on the other. He told himself to imagine a third pile, one that had no stones at all, only a piece of string that could be pulled and make the other two piles fall over. He told himself that sometimes names do not kill things; sometimes they prevent killing by being said in a small room where only two people can hear.

A woman with shoulders like a doorframe came to fetch them and took them not to the great sway but down three steps into a chamber where the ceiling had been carved into ribs to make the echo behave. Aro Gaini was there with his hand on a table made of a slice of wood so old it had its own calendar. He looked at Lio with the look of a being who has seen many humans and chosen to be neither amused nor annoyed at the sight. He looked at Davi and did a small softening, because anyone with a lick of sense softens when Davi is in the room. He said, “You brought me tallies,” and Lio saw the corner of his mouth do a thing that would have been called a smile if it had lived on any other face.

Lio bowed the way humans bow to apes who govern and not the way humans bow to apes who own, and he put his forms on the table with dignity and without apology. “I brought you numbers about a thing you already know,” he said, which in his language meant I respect you enough to know you already know my argument and I am still going to make it because that is what ritual is for. “I will not read them. You can have them read to you by a boy whose voice you like. I came to say the word off-tally to your face.”

The carrier moved like an animal in a sleep full of dreams. Lio put his tongue as flat as he could and kept going. “I came to say: you are about to do a thing that will be called good by men who count sacks of rice. It will be called good by mothers who do not want to watch their thin children die in public where it my be catching. It will be called good by tallies who like clean columns. It will feel good in your own chest because it is order and you like order better than most men who could hurt as much as you can hurt. It will also become a door. You will not be able to close it once it has been used that way twice. People like me will not be able to keep people like them from shoving their children through because the numbers will be on their side. You are honorable, and that is not a word I use for anyone with a sash whose voice makes people behave. If you do this and I let you, I will have to call you something else when I tell my city’s story to my nephew. I do not want to have to change that word. It is a small thing. It is a large thing. I am putting it on your table.”

Davi lifted his hand and then put it down, because he had promised Lio he would speak only if the room needed a joke and the room did not. Aro Gaini took one of the forms and turned it over without looking at the words. He traced the edge with a finger like a scar makes a map. He said, “The rope inspection office did a thing I told them to do later. I told them to do it in silk and they did it in iron. That is partly my fault. I let my patience be interpreted as permission. That is a lesson I have to learn again at this age; I thought I had learned it already.” He set the form down. “You carry something in you that is not a number.”

Lio had not intended to show surprise. He was tired and did anyway. The silverback did not smile. He continued in the tone of a man who has had to know what is being carried toward him since he was young. “I can smell things,” he said. “My blood does that. Your breath has on it a sour that is not any fruit we grow. Your hands shake and you are not a shaking man. Someone gave you a tool they want you to use. It was clever of them. You are beloved enough by enough people that this would make a noise that could be called music by those who like the old drums. It would ruin me. It would also ruin you. It would give a door to other men with fewer adjectives.”

Lio made himself swallow and felt the animal in his belly make a small offended sound. “If you know this,” he said, “you know why I came.”

Aro Gaini put both hands on the table as if what mattered was not the words but the body making them. “I came to this room wanting to be right,” he said. “It is a habit. I am not right. I am between lions. One of them is empty bowls and loud funerals. The other is what any creature with a great brain and a long arm does when it wishes to keep its offspring from being hungry in a year that does not yet exist. I have always preferred a lion I can see. Today I saw the one I could not. It has a copper strip in its teeth. It has clever human hands. It has a list. I could kill that lion. I could cut off its tails. But then I would have made a lion that my children’s children would have to fight in rooms, and rooms are worse than fields.”

He looked at Lio the way a tree looks at a man who has climbed it without asking permission and has not carved his name into the bark. “I will say this plainly. We will not make boxes this year. We will not make apprenticeships that are one-way. We will carry water and we will wash our pipes and we will do the hateful work of waiting and seeing if a city can hold itself together with work instead of cleverness. We will be called cowards and we will be called saints and both names will be wrong. I will tell the rope inspection office to count only rope. I will do it in front of the gibbons so that there are witnesses who sing. I will give you nothing in writing because my children will read it and make it law and I do not want this to be law because what is law can be rewritten when a man with my hair who does not have my lungs sits here. I want this to be my face remembered by the correct mouths as the face of a man who said no when numbers asked him to say yes.”

He inhaled very slowly and then let it out, in the way apes do when they have put down a heavy thing without showing strain. “In return,” he said, and the old coin glittered on his belt for no reason at all, “you will not cough in my direction for thirty days. If you cough, I will become the lion I know how to fight and I will chase you into whatever red place you think is safe. I will let you keep your nephew as a man who laughs at you. I will insist that he sign one paper that says he will teach five other boys how to solder and not to lick their fingers after. I will insist that you teach one clerk how to write a form that gets delivered to the wrong office on purpose. If you betray this, I will not use boxes. I will use a different word that means the same thing and sleep badly and then die and no one will remember that there was a choice today.”

The carrier in Lio’s belly had never been more present and more irrelevant. He felt, with a clarity that put his hands on the table because the table had gravity, that this was one of those moments where his life became something that would be told with different adjectives depending on who survived. He nodded once. He did not say thank you because what kind of thank you do you say to a man for choosing not to be killed. He did not say I will hold my breath because spite makes bad promises. He said, “Yes,” and for one junkyard second the thing inside him stirred like a dog at a door and then settled because it hears more than words when it chooses its master.

They left with no paper and every paper. Outside, the gibbons were already practising a song that sounds like a secret spoken backwards. Davi did not speak until they were halfway to the stall because he had learned not to spend words that might be needed later. When he did, it was with the giddy thinness that comes with a night where your heart had been taken to the roof and shown the city. “Uncle,” he said, “if you begin to enjoy being this kind of person, I will tell everyone embarrassing things about your handwriting.”

“You will do that anyway,” Lio said, because normality is a rope you can always step on when you need to feel a knot under your foot. He put his hand on the pouch of his jacket where the first bag had once been and then on his stomach where the new bag lived and told both places that they could rest a little.

When they reached the stall, Saera was there with a face like someone who has stopped a harness from breaking by chewing it. She said nothing and that was her praise. Pell came later with a handful of berries that stained his fingers red in a way that looked like nothing except fruit, and he sat and ate and watched and only said, at last, with a relief he did not attempt to cover, “They have put stones back where they belong. The room is spitting and will spit all night and then it will forget what it was saying. The boy who thought he was going to be holy has been sent to carry water for a week. He is very angry at all of us. That is correct.”

Lio did not yet know what the carrier would do in his body when the thirty days scratched their line on his calendar. He did not know whether some man in some room would ignore a song and decide that kin still needed to be made into law somewhere else where his hands could not reach. He did not know whether Aro Gaini would be able to keep his face this shape for a season while wind and hunger worked at it the way they work at everything. He did not know whether the red corridors would call to him at night like a lover he did not trust. He knew only the next thing. He slept a little that night, and in the morning he woke to the world he had helped make and to a letter tied to a nut thrown at his window. It said, in bad ink made better by its content: your thirty days will not go to waste if you like mushrooms. Come, we can bend a scale together. Do not bring a bag. Bring your curiosity. Do not tell the trees.The note hit his window with a soft crack that sounded like a nut deciding something, and for a moment Lio imagined some small-headed child with good aim and a future full of rope-knots legging it away, pleased with his own arm. He untied the twine and read what was there in bad ink made better by its purpose; it was the kind of letter that assumes it will be obeyed and so spends no time on charm. His name was not on it. That felt like a kind of respect he knew how to accept. He held the nut in his palm after and weighed it like a coin to be flipped and then did not flip it, because luck was not the right instrument for this morning.

Davi came in with a coil around his neck like a lazy snake and an expression that said he had already laughed at two people and forgiven a third. “Is that my rent?” he asked, and when Lio lifted the nut he made a solemn noise that was halfway between yes and the start of a joke. “We are very rich now. We can buy a smile and a small orange.”

“Your rent is to stop calling capacitors by pet names in front of customers,” Lio said, without looking up from the bad ink. “We are invited to like mushrooms.”

“Who invites a person to like mushrooms,” Davi said, delighted. “People like mushrooms by discovering them in the bottom of a pan and being grateful.”

“People invite people to weigh houses,” Lio said. “It is a metaphor making itself literal. Pell wants us to bend a scale.”

Davi uncoiled the coil and set it on the table as if presenting a plate. “Then we will bring a coil for charm and a small wrench for persuasion,” he said. “And shoes that will not squeak on floors made to confess footsteps.”

The weigh-house lived where the river took its breath between loads, a squat building that had once been the belly of a tree and now wore stone like memory. It had a smell that was ritual and grease, a yesterday of fish and a tomorrow of spice, and the floor kept the weight of history in its timbers, which is a thing a good scale knows to look for with something like relief. The doors were already open as if to say, come in, we cannot be guilty with the light invited in so generously. Pell met them under a beam rubbed smooth by hands that trusted wood, not steel, and he had a smile that made you want to ignore how often his mouth had been used to say difficult things.

“The soft-eyed man is the wrong man today,” he said, gesturing with his chin to a human clerk with a mustache that looked like extra punctuation. “We have a chump with hard eyes and a new stamp. He will need to be taught to love arithmetic that sings.”

Davi leaned in, delighted, and whispered, “You do realize you are flirting with me by saying things like that.”

“I flirt with outcomes,” Pell said, but he let his mouth accept a little curve at its edge. “Here is the plan written in meat and hinge. The scale on the west beams is truer than the north; the west is old and likes being honest. The north is new and wishes to impress its mother. We teach the north to doubt itself. We make it see ghosts. We put mushrooms in the counterweights.”

Lio watched two porters wheel in a crate of squat white caps and understood at once, without having to be told, that the mushrooms in question were not for eating unless you liked your conversations with the ground to be long and unforgiving. The caps had been grown in the red corridor, in conditions that controlled their thirst like a polite tyrant. The trick, Pell explained without explaining, was water. The mushrooms would drink when told and swell like gossip; a gram is as real as a rumor when the scale says so. If you put them where the scale thinks it is measuring iron and let them learn the schedule of the room, the weights would keep a second calendar. They would be a burden that arrived and left like weather. It would make the north beam inaccurate enough to make a man hesitate but not enough to send for a mechanic.

Davi loved it immediately, obviously, entirely. “We will give the scale a headache,” he said, reverent. “It will see a weight and think, ah, but is this weight in a good mood.”

“Do not be seen,” Pell said, which in his language included a clause that meant, do not be noticed even if you are looked at, which is a different skill and a better one. He nodded at the chump with the stamp. “That one likes to perform being correct even when nothing is being measured. He clears his throat when the weights are at rest.”

Lio adjusted his face to his clerk face, the one that let him evaporate while standing three feet from a problem. He took a ledger and held a pencil and did nothing with either except exist. Davi rolled himself under the north beam like a man going to inspect a misbehaving river and came back out with a smudge of grease and a length of copper wire that might have been in his sleeve by accident or might have been exactly where he had intended it all along. He did not speak to the chump. He sang very softly to a bolt instead, under his breath, the kind of private music people make for machines when they want them to remember being less stubborn.

They opened the counterweight casings with a key that belonged to nobody and everybody in the room, because in a city where weight is law, the keys to the law are often left near the window. The white caps went in shy as fat birds, and Davi tucked a coil just so to give them something to press against when they woke up. Lio stood by and did his job, which was to be the kind of man that if anyone thought about him at all they would think, oh, he is balancing something unimportant and then forget it before it had words. Pell leaned, and in his leaners’ posture Lio saw the counsel of a creature who had watched a hundred small moves become a large one and knew where to put his hand on a table to prevent it from flipping too soon.

When the weights went back in, they looked like weights. When the beam creaked, it creaked like a beam. When the chump with the stamp cleared his throat, it sounded like a man reminding his own body that he had authority. A cart rolled on and the scale told a lie so tiny and so sweet that it felt like good manners. It lied again, differently, the next time, because the mushrooms had done what mushrooms do, which is remember humidity. In the afternoon, when the river’s breath made the beams sweat a little, the lie shifted its hips. The chump frowned at his numbers and the men who had brought sacks of cassava looked at each other and decided that perhaps the weigh-house had become haunted by the old tree it had been and haunted trees like to be appeased with a joke. They began telling jokes at the chump’s expense. They were not cruel jokes. They were middle jokes, the kind that make you belong and also remind you that belonging is a tax.

By noon, two other scales had been called upon to verify numbers that did not wish to be fixed, and the word had gone around that the north beam was on her humors. A lemur Lio knew by whisker pattern started a rumor, which is an advanced skill among lemurs when the rumor can push a problem sideways into a better place. He said, loudly enough for the right ears, that the new stamp the chump carried was the wrong metal for this sort of building and would keep warping the arithmetic until it was replaced by a stamp that had belonged to a more patient generation. This insulted nobody in specific and everyone a little. The chump did not know whether to be proud or ashamed and so settled for stern. Lio put his pencil down for a moment and then picked it up again in a way that made it sound like a decision. Davi came out from under the beam again, this time with a smear of mushroom on his sleeve that he wiped off with a flick of his wrist as if he had been bitten by an affectionate feather.

“You have three days,” Pell murmured, drifting away into the flow of people in a way that would keep him in the room forever if he wanted to be. “Then they will fetch a fixer with eyes that count differently. We will have to make the fixers delay. There is a woman with a stamp who will try to turn this into a story about you whether or not it is your story. Do not play your part when she hands it to you. Put your hands behind your back and let the role fall on the floor.”

They came out into light that felt like a cup set down on the table just a little hard. The city was doing its post-Branch quiet, a kind of convalescence where songs lived under tongues and the ropes moved without commentary. It was quieter in the way a planned market is quiet, full of intentions that do not wish to be seen until they have fruit in their hands. Lio felt the thing in his gut roll over, just once, like a sleeper changing his mind about a dream. He let the movement pass through his mind without building a thought on it. He had learned, in the last day, how to be careful with the scaffolding of his own idea-making. He had discovered there were places inside him that were less room than trap.

The woman with the stamp found them before they reached Davi’s stall. Of course she did. If you give a woman like that a scene, she will choose the staging that makes her word look like the only available word and then she will say it. She had her stamp strapped to her back like a weapon, which is what it was, and two clerks who had learned how to look like posts. She walked as if the ropeways belonged to her and were merely allowing others to borrow them for the sake of friendliness. She had eyes that had memorized the shapes of three or four kinds of smugness and did not permit herself any of them.

“You are Lio Ketter,” she said, and made it a period and not a question. “You are Davi of Radio Quiet. You were at the weigh-house where irregularities tickled the numbers until they giggled. You made a paper go to the wrong place so that it would pass through the room where hot tea is kept. Your nephew carries a coil like a priest carries a symbol. These are not crimes. These are timing. Timing is half a crime.”

Lio did not look at Davi because looking is a kind of permission sometimes and he would not give this woman any. He bowed at the waist in the very old way that was used when people did not yet trust words. He chose a title for her out loud. “Inspector,” he said, as if it were the first time the word had been said to her and it pleased him to give it. He kept his hands visible. He did not volunteer a single piece of information about anything that did not want to be voluntarily information.

“My name is Maru,” she said, and now that she had her name in their mouths she could relax into it. She was taller than either of them, and she had a scratch at her throat that said a monkey had recently reminded her that small things bite beautifully. “I have been told to admire and to dislike you in equal measures. I do not know how to do two things with one face. I prefer to speak to you and then decide which face to wear.”

Davi made a sound like a waiter clearing a plate without agreed-upon hand signals. “My uncle is very tidy with numbers,” he said, because sometimes stating a new truth in a room that wants to be a drama makes the actors forget their lines. “I am very untidy with wire. We make a good sum.”

Maru’s mouth twitched in what might have been almost-laughter if she had been built to allow that to happen in public. “You have a thing in your gut,” she said to Lio without judgement. “Do not bother hiding it. I have a nose. I have a child. I know the smell of fear that grows its own cells. If it were up to me, I would give you a doctor and a rope that led to a quiet room where nobody said a name within a hundred breaths. It is not up to me. It is up to a silverback and a room and a river and the season that follows cholera.”

“He spoke to you,” Lio said, because that was the only sentence in the group that would open a door he wanted opened. He did not say the Chancellor’s name because his mouth did not belong to him entirely when that name was near and he had learned not to share property without papers.

“He did,” Maru said, and her eyes did something lonely for the length of a blink. “He told me to count rope. He did not make it a metaphor. I do not like being told to count things without being allowed to count the edges of the thing. It makes my hands itch. But this week I will count rope.”

There was, for a heartbeat, the possibility that they could all be on the same side of something large and conventional and not have to perform cleverness at each other like a sex. The heartbeat ended. Maru hooked her stamp off her back and held it as if it were a heavy bird. “Do not make my beams sing,” she said. “If they sing, I have to dance. I am not a dancer. I will step on too many toes and then the men who want boxes will call me coarse and hand me a different song to learn. If you must make the room tilt, do it where the floorboards are rotten. Do not do it where the floorboards are mine.”

“We will leave your beams to their humors,” Lio said. He was telling the truth and he was lying; this is what it feels like to negotiate with a person you do not disapprove of. “We will tie our ropes where they can hold a different weight. There are more doors than anyone puts on a map.”

She looked at Davi and let her eyes rest there for long enough to be a threat and long enough to be a promise, because a man with hands like that could be employed properly or badly and she would prefer to be the one who chose. “If you go into rooms you cannot name without choking,” she said, “come out quickly. I like my city with a map that changes slowly enough for my child to remember it day to day.” Then she shouldered her stamp and went back into being a part of the furniture in a different room which needed the sort of furniture that keeps papers on tables and hands where they can be seen.

They did not go back to the stall at once because stopping moving is how you let fear catch up to ankles and chew. They took a ropeway that was never crowded after midday and let it deliver them to a part of the city where old sap ran in the walls and the air tasted like the middle of a nut. The red corridor that Pell had promised was visible and not; it showed itself where a splash of paint had been scraped off by accident and where a door had been nailed and un-nailed so many times that the wood could no longer forget. Inside, the light was the same color as a good warning. The man with soft eyes was there, his softness put away for the hour like a shirt you don’t wear to meet certain kinds of customers. He gave Lio the look of someone who is about to do him a kindness and would prefer not to have to say so.

“There is a mycologist,” he said, and Lio had never heard a word so long and so tidy spoken in a room so red. “She does tricks with white. She eats poison in bowls and spits out sugar. She could maybe make your carrier eat a memory and then go quiet. She has a scar on her lip and three opinions about children. She will not take your money. She will take your time and offer you a song.”

The mycologist was an orangutan with hair like flame and the presence of a person who knows the tempo of patience well enough to speed it up when she wants to amuse herself. She sat at a table with a basin of something that might have been water and might have been knowledge. There were wooden frames labeled with thin, scrupulous handwriting in three scripts, because it takes three alphabets to be this precise when you speak among three kinds of hands. She glanced at Lio’s mouth as if checking if a word had been left there by mistake and then put her hand on the basin so that the water took her temperature and decided to behave.

“You have inside you a polite parasite with an appetite for names,” she said. “Do not nod. I can tell by the way your belt has one extra notch open and your nails have a line of dust in a place the average man’s do not. I can tell by your breath, which is sour where it ought to be only tired. I can tell because you would not be in this room without a reason and I am so interested in reasons that I have not eaten the last two hours.”

Davi’s eyes were everything that is good about youth and too much skill in a small space: adoration and alertness and a secret that is not yet a secret. “Can you—” he began, and Lio put a hand on his arm not to stop him but to ask him, with a squeeze, to let the woman speak a paragraph before they asked for a cure and made the air go thin with hope.

“I can make it stupid,” she said, as if the sentence were a berry she had decided to share. “I can feed it shapes that sound like its dinner but will give it indigestion. It will live and not know what to do when it hears the name it was made to hear. It will move as if to pounce and then forget which direction a body is. It is not ideal. It is also better than dying on the thirty-first day and making everyone you love say the wrong kind of story about you. It will not be quick. You will not be comfortable. You will have to speak to me for hours and make your mouth do things it does not like to do. You will drink tea that tastes like a brag broken into parts and boiled. You will not get to be a hero. You will get to be a man who took a medicine in time.”

“What do you want from me that is not money,” Lio asked, because he knew how red corridors worked; he had bought access once and it had cost him a way of looking at his city that he had to live without after.

“I want your curiosity,” she said at once, without flourish, as if she had been waiting at a marketplace stall to buy it the way one buys light fruit. “Bring it here and let it watch me make the white sing. Bring it here and tell it it is allowed to ask me why twice for every one time I say because. Bring me the shape of the name you were taught. I will not use it as you fear. I will build decoys around it as if it were a house I wish to hide from the road. When the road passes, the house will still be there and the carrier will get lost and end up asleep in the ditch.”

“How many men have you done this for,” Davi asked, simple, respectful, and nosy in the way children are when they still think numbers heal anxiety.

“None,” she said, without apology. “No one has brought me a polite parasite with an appetite for names. People bring me poisons that do not pretend to be civilized. Those are easy. They are stupid because they know they are stupid. Yours has a library card. I am looking forward to shaming it.”

Lio tried to imagine his curiosity as coin and found it was heavier than he had thought; perhaps he had expected it to be feathers because that is how he had always carried it, as decoration rather than weight. He set it on the table and let the woman see it, the way a man puts a tool down between professionals and lets the other tell him if he has been using it wrong. She smiled at his face as if he had told a particularly satisfying joke.

“You will hate me,” she said, and then softened the sentence with the sort of grin that makes you feel like hating will become something you do socially over a drink later, not alone in the dark. “We will be in each other’s mouths. That always breeds contempt for a day or two. You will also leave knowing things about the guts of breath that will ruin your enjoyment of some songs and improve your survival of others. You may even become boring at parties.”

“Too late,” Davi said under his breath, which was cruel and loving in exactly equal parts.

They began at once because there is no better beginning than beginning. The tea did taste like a brag that had been punished; it was bitter with a finish that made the tongue believe in mushrooms against its will. The woman—she told them to call her Sefi, which made Lio believe at once in both her patience and her willingness to hit a man with a ladle if he forgot her instructions—taught him to make his throat hollow and to fill it with little ladders of tone that went nowhere and everywhere. She showed him how to put gravel under a vowel and sand under a consonant so that the carrier would think it was walking into a familiar room and then fall through the floor. She made him practice until sweat ran down his back and he forgot he had come into the red corridor to avoid sweating to death. Davi watched until watching became unbearable and then picked up a frame and began cleaning it with a cloth so that his hands would have the dignity of work while his face had to remain open.

In the pauses, Lio counted. He counted breaths, because counting breaths calmed a man who had spent his life counting other people’s receipts; it made the mathematics part of his body feel useful again after days of being asked to be brave. He counted the muscles that hurt and found new ones. He counted how many times Sefi’s eyebrow lifted before she gave him a biscuit. He counted the length of the silence that followed each time the carrier inside him perked its head and then sank back with a confused animal noise. It was not language, what he heard. It was the absence of language realizing it had been tricked into believing it could speak.

They came out of the red corridor when the light had softened into the hour that makes you think of soup whether or not you have an onion in your house. Lio’s mouth felt like a room after a party, floors sticky, chairs askew. Davi walked like a man who had not moved enough and whose body had decided to punish him with fidgets. They did not talk for a little while because talking had become a job and they needed to let it be a luxury for half a block so that their attachments would not rust.

At the stall, Saera was waiting with an expression like a well-aimed cup set down correctly. She looked at their faces and at Lio’s throat and did not ask him anything out loud because she had learned her lesson regarding asking men who carry explosives in their bellies to inventory their feelings. She said instead, “The room has dulled its teeth for a day. We had a fight that wore us out. You have bought hours with whatever you have just done. There is a new complaint you need to see. It is written beautifully and it is lying. It lies with all the manners of a letter from a monk.”

The complaint came written in a hand Lio recognized from a previously unrelated document, which means the city is either smaller than anyone admits or exactly the size it must be for consequence to find faces. It spoke in praise first—that is always how the long lies begin—and then slipped, politely, into a series of allegations about human traders and their capacities for hoarding and the irresponsible sale of metal to children. It named Radio Quiet without naming it. It did not say Davi. It said nephew, which somehow was more intimate. It requested the suspension of certain licenses during a period of civic focus. It had three signatures, none of whom were men who would be recognized by a person who mattered. Lio admired it in the way a tailor admires a suit that will look good on a man he does not like. He found where the seam could be pulled.

“Maru will see this,” he said, putting the paper down with the respect a craftsman gives even a bad piece of wood. “She will see it and be relieved, because it will be something to count that is not rope. She will overcorrect. She will be nicer to us in public and worse in rooms. We need to make the public watch her be nice to us so that the room will not permit her to be worse.”

“How,” Saera said, with neither hope nor despair in the vowel.

“Permits,” Lio said, and then added, because some pleasures should be shared even in a crisis, “and bells.”

They did it the way you do a trick twice so that people stop thinking it is a trick and begin to think it is tradition. Lio showed up at the rope inspection office not with a complaint but with a basket of fresh forms that had been re-stamped in a color no one had used for three seasons, which made clerks salivate. He asked to renew permits that were nowhere near their expiration because he wanted an audience and because renewing a thing early is a way to tell a room that it is safe to be generous. He had Davi carry in a string of small bells that had been wired in a glorious, irresponsible pattern that made them flash and ring and flash again in a pattern no one could predict. He let the bells hang in the office while he talked, two men making the air around a desk into a festival. People came to the doorway to look and to laugh, because even clerks appreciate a piece of tin that understands them.

Maru came out of a back room wearing the face of a woman who had decided which of her two faces today had to be forward. She took in the bells, the forms, the basket of bitter fruit Davi had put under the table as if to prop it up, and she understood, because Maru is not stupid, that this was not a bribe, not exactly. It was better. It was demand for a performance. It said: be seen while you say no so that no becomes a joke and jokes become the city’s remembered law.

She played her part with the grace of a woman who does not mind being used when the end requires her to admit the end was hers anyway. She stamped the permits. She said they would not be suspending anything that helped the market feed the city. She stood under the bells and let Davi adjust a wire near her ear so that the light made a halo she could pretend not to notice. Someone in the doorway clapped as if this had been a recital. The room took the story it was fed and began digesting.

News travels in Rainrut the way thunder does when there is a mountain to bounce off of. By evening, the complaint had been read aloud in three stalls and declared well-written and inconvenient. It had been dropped in a puddle. It had been copied badly by a boy who liked to see his own potential in ink. It had not become the reason anyone did anything, which is a kind of success you learn to count differently after a certain age.

Night took their corners and polished them. Lio lay on his bed with his hands on his own ribs as if they were a fence and he was guarding something not to keep it in but to keep it from being stolen. The carrier inside him had not moved in a way he could name since Sefi had made him hum wrong on purpose. His throat hurt in a place he had never felt hurt before, a place that made him think of the first time he had been thirsty enough to understand thirst as a concept. He imagined thirty days as thirty knots and told himself not to skip ahead and pull any of them loose with his mind before it was time.

In the morning, there was a new letter tied to a different nut in the window, because sometimes the world understands that consistency becomes an advertisement. It said, in ink that had been upgraded to good on somebody’s insistence: the boy with a holy hunger has been given to his aunt to mind and she minds with a spoon. the room wants a spectacle and it will settle for a rumor if the rumor is well-planted. meet me at the place where the rope has three splices and one is a lie. do not bring anyone who cannot keep his eyes on his own hands. bring your ugly voice. bring coins. leave everything that can be called a priority in your other jacket.

He went. Davi went because he had already put his hands in his pockets like a man who plans to come and does not intend to remove them to be argued with. The place was where the rope had three splices and one was a lie, which tells you everything you need to know about a neighborhood if you understand rope. Pell appeared by tilting a leaf he had been not standing behind. He had with him a woman who was all ankles and anger and who kept her hands in fists but not for hitting; she held them like a person who had carried twins and forgotten how to put them down. The ropes above them made a sound like a pig being soothed, which is to say, hopeful and hopeless at once.

“There will be a vote again tonight,” Pell said. “They want an emblem and they are tired of being told by three of us that emblems are poison that taste like candy. We can starve them with laughter as Saera wishes, and we can starve them with mushrooms as Sefi does, and we can starve them by tying and untying the city’s strings until they remember their fingers hurt. It will not be enough if they are hungry in the wrong way. We bend a scale, yes. We will also bend a story.”

“How,” Davi said, simple, his genius the act of turning chaos into a how that could be done before sundown.

“We tell a tale about a man who became holy and was disappointed,” the ankle-anger woman said, in a voice like a saw making a decision. “We put it in the mouths of the gibbons because no one remembers arguments as songs unless a gibbon wears them. We have them sing a false kin law that demands the sacrifice of a number instead of a limb. We say it requires a ledger to be burnt in public by a man who has never once forged a signature and we make it sound like beauty. We let the room argue about aesthetics and forget the boy.”

“We lie to the liars with prettier lies,” Lio said, without feeling clever about it. He had learned the week’s lesson: sometimes you throw a blanket over a fire instead of water because water spreads it into corners you cannot reach.

“You will deliver the line that hurts,” Pell said, looking almost apologetic. “Your ugly voice will make it go inside ears that would reject a prettier accent. You will say the sentence that pushes pride where hunger would prefer to live. You will be called names. If they are creative, write them down for me. If they are dull, tell me anyway so that I can teach them better insults.”

It was not a thing Lio liked to do, make his mouth into a weapon in a room where the weapon might hit his friends as well as his enemies. That did not mean he could not do it. He could, and from the way Davi looked at him while pretending to examine the knotwork of a splice, he could do it in a way that later would make them both sick and a little glad.

They spent the afternoon at the stall preparing nothing that would help and everything that would make them feel like they could help. Davi repaired a radio that had only ever been loyal on rainy days and told it that tonight it would be allowed to be fickle; he would love it anyway. Lio wrote three forms that he might need in order to justify the sound of his own voice, because sometimes you need to write the paperwork for your conscience before your conscience will permit you to be useful.

At twilight, the gibbons gathered on a beam that had never been used for this purpose before, because new songs prefer new perches. The room that Saera never named had moved like a school of fish into a clearing that had spent the day pretending to be a market and now pretended to be civic. Torches were not necessary but were present, because spectacle likes fire. The boy who had thought he would become holy stood at the back with his aunt gripping his ear in a way that meant she would not be letting go even if he grew into a whale. Saera had beads that looked like bruises and a smile that was not one. Maru leaned against a tree with her stamp laid along her thigh like a pet. Aro Gaini was not there; he had sent a chimp with coins who looked at everything and nothing like a man who carries another man’s eyes under his belt.

The song began stupid, because it is good to begin there; it lulls the clever into a yawn. The gibbons sang a nursery-rhyme about ropes and beans and people who put beans in their ears and then asked why their heads felt like rain. Then it shifted into a pattern that Lio recognized because he had been taught this morning by Sefi how to make his own voice make decoys. The gibbons made names out of shapes that were almost names, and the room laughed without knowing why it was relieved. Then came the lie, soft and shameless, that said kin law had a new clause written by a grandmother, since grandmothers are the only acceptable authors of cruelty when you wish to disguise it. It said the right sacrifice was to burn the ledger of a clerk who had never cheated. It said this would teach the city to love its tallies so much it would never permit a bad one to be made again. It said you cannot cut an arm from a boy and call it kin; you must cut the book that keeps him pinned to a number and that will make him holy.

It was beautiful. It was nonsense. It made a noise the brain loves more than truth.

Lio’s line came then. He stepped forward like a man who has stepped into rope-air a thousand times and does not think about the fall. He turned his throat into the ugly instrument Sefi had left him and he said, “If you want a saint, scrub a table,” and the words landed exactly where Pell had wanted them to, on the pride of men who preferred torchlight to dishwater. Someone guffawed in a way that broke the cult out of a dozen faces and made them citizens again. Someone else said, in the very back, the word theft and a third voice said, good, say it, and the word rolled forward like a penny, small and honest.

They shouted at him. Of course they did. The shouting did not have teeth. It had lips and cheeks. It had the friendliness of men who will go home and sleep after they call you a coward in public and regret it by breakfast because their daughters will tell them their mouths smelled like old garlic. Lio took the shouting and turned it into the thing it had been paid for: noise. Under the noise, the boy’s aunt took him home by the ear. Under the noise, Maru did not move her stamp. Under the noise, Saera folded her beads into her hair while pledging non-specific thanks to the old tree they stood under, which had agreed to be a room and not a gallows.

When it was done, Pell came and pressed his forehead briefly to Lio’s shoulder in a gesture that, in his people, could be the start of many things including friendship. “It is not over,” he said, so that later, when it failed to be over, Lio could not accuse him of offering hope dressed as certainty. “But the room has eaten enough excuses for one night. Tomorrow it will remember digestion and not appetites. Go sleep with your ugly voice. It has earned a bed.”

They slept badly and rose early and the day made them do other things. The scale at the weigh-house began to complain in a tone that made the chump with the stamp feel that his authority was being mocked in a language he did not speak. Sefi sent a boy with a bowl of liquid that did not spill and a demand for Lio to come back in the afternoon to learn how to cough without meaning it as a cough. A letter arrived for Davi from a child who had been permitted to keep a coil for a night and wanted to know if the coil missed him; Davi answered it with the gravity of a priest.

On the fourth day, Aro Gaini stood in the place where rope inspectors begin their day and said, in the hearing of the gibbons and therefore the city, that rope would be counted and children would not. He used the word rope as if children were a kind of rope, which, in this city, could be read as a compliment. The woman with the stamp bowed her head and narrowed her eyes. People smiled without understanding why their mouths did it. The boy who had thought himself holy was seen carrying buckets two at a time with the dignity of a saint’s cousin who decides to be practical.

Lio marked off a day on his inward tally and felt the carrier sulk at the back of his breath. He drank Sefi’s tea and made the decoy sounds until he could make them in his sleep. He stacked forms with the deftness of a magician who prefers the party not to know he is a magician. He found that sleep came to him like a permit with a missing signature and he had to make a new form to justify it, which is to say, he slept only when Davi talked him into it by talking about something else aloud until Lio’s mind had been run into one of those alleys where it is safest to stop.

On the seventh day, Maru came to the stall without her stamp and an orange. She put the orange on the table the way a survivor puts a hand on a grave. “There are men above me who will make a show of concern tomorrow if the numbers do not behave tonight,” she said, looking at a bolt that did not need looking at. “They will use words like flood and risk and human cluster and distribution. I will be required to make a face that looks like agreement. It would be convenient if a scale failed so spectacularly in some other district that we had to close all the houses and count rope again.”

“We could put mushrooms in their tea,” Davi said, straight-faced, which earned him the smallest of Maru’s actual laughs, a noise like a glass chiming somewhere behind a wall.

“We can make a scale sing until it loses its voice,” Lio said. “We will choose a place that will be grateful to be chosen. There is a warehouse with a stubborn floor. It will pretend to be an accident. Make sure your men look like they are surprised when you arrive. There will be a gibbon already there who will lead a chorus of mercy.”

She put a coin on the table beside the orange and then another, and when Davi looked at the coins and made a face that meant he was about to decline money because it cast a particular shadow, she pushed them toward him with a finger. “Buy wire,” she said. “Not because you need it. Because I need to see you buying wire like a citizen and not stealing good from evil in a corridor. Give me the illusion that I govern a city where such gestures matter.”

They did as people asked them to do because that is the secret they had learned: sometimes you are the city’s hands and sometimes you are its fingers, but hands and fingers both obey requests if the wrist is balanced. They bent a scale in a different district so gently that the men who weighed sacks of grain blamed the weather and then laughed because blaming the weather is a joke you can keep making until it becomes a prayer. They drank more of Sefi’s tea and Lio made an ugly sound with his throat so perfect that Sefi clapped without meaning to and then looked embarrassed by her applause. They worked like clerks and thieves and cousins and all the words people use for people who keep a place going when the story tries to run away from itself.

On the twelfth day, Lio’s belly hurt in a new way and he went to Sefi with it and she put her palm just above his belt and closed her eyes. “It is hungry,” she said affectionately, like a grandmother about a grandchild who has decided that sand is a food. “It will not be fed. We have taught it to be suspicious of its own appetite. If you were a plant, I would repot you. As you are not, I will give you a broth that tastes like a lie told by a friend. Do not trust it either. Drink it anyway.”

He did. It helped. He realized, somewhere around sunset the next day, that he had not thought about the thirty-first day in three hours. He let himself feel the relief for the length of a breath and then put it away because relief makes you stupid if you let it live in the part of your brain where you keep the recipes for sabotage.

On the fifteenth day, the bad ink of the first letter returned with better penmanship and new content. It said: a man with a coin belt is watching a door he did not know existed. he will be patient for three days and then he will be less patient. if you want him to remain honorable, give him a reason to go home. take him an onion. tell him it is for soup for his children. give him a reason to believe in the version of himself that eats with his hands and not with his teeth. do not tell the trees.

Lio read that out loud and then they both sat with it, because sometimes the city asks you to do something that sounds too small to matter and you have to remember how to count. Davi went to buy an onion as if he were shopping for a wedding gift. Lio wrote a note to go with it that said nothing and everything; it mentioned soup and gravity and a child’s laugh at a bad joke. They gave the onion to a chimp with coins without making it an act and in the morning the door had a different shadow and the man with the belt had taken his hunger home.

By the nineteenth day, the gibbons had a new verse that compared scales to mothers in a way that made the mothers clap and the scales blush. The red corridor had found a rhythm for its work on Lio that made Sefi almost bored, which is the highest praise a healer gives a patient who was trying to die awkwardly. The boy who had been nearly holy had learned to spit neatly from a moving rope into a bucket, which is the kind of skill that keeps a man alive in the drought season. Maru had found a way to look amused at the right moments while insulting a man above her who would not notice banked fires until his tail was smoking. Aro Gaini had learned to say rope in a way that included all the things people were afraid to name and he had not yet choked on his own word.

On the twenty-third day, Lio dreamed that he said the shape of Aro Gaini’s name by accident when he sneezed and woke up with his heart thrashing like a fish on a plank. He lay there and talked himself through his own body the way Sefi had taught him to: he told his throat it was a door that stayed shut when it did not recognize the right knock. He told his belly it was a quiet room in a library, not a market. He named three kinds of fruit he had eaten as a child and then forgot he was afraid and slept again. In the morning, Davi told him he had said please in his sleep in the voice he used on clerks. It was both endearing and a little sad.

On the twenty-fifth, the soft-eyed man of the red corridor found them in a market and told them, with an air like a man reporting rainfall totals, that one of the river posts had begun weighing sacks of scrap as if they were saints and that the man who counted had developed a fondness for the way metal sang in a box when it hit the side. “We have created an aesthetic,” he said, almost impressed. “We must be careful not to sell tickets.”

On the twenty-sixth, a woman came to the stall and asked Davi to make a radio that could only receive one voice. He refused gently and then made her a radio that could receive many but had a little line of paint on the volume that told her where to put it when she wanted to hear her husband and not the gibbons. She cried a little. Lio stamped a permit in his sleep and woke up with ink on his fingertip and guilt and washed both away with stubbornness and a cloth.

On the twenty-seventh, the woman with the stamp arrived with a bruise that had not been there the last time. She did not explain it. She took three bells from Davi and hung them on her stamp and said, “If someone hits me while I am stamping, I want them to have to listen to music.” She asked Lio a question she had saved like candy. “If you had to choose between a ledger and a boy, which would you save from a fire.”

“A ladder,” Lio said, because he had learned to be very careful and very cruel in rooms where the question is a trap. “I would save a ladder.”

Maru laughed and then bit it back like a man bites a lemon. “You are better than it is healthy for a man to be,” she said. “I hope you die old in your bed and not interesting in a song.”

On the twenty-ninth day, Sefi put both hands on Lio’s face and opened his mouth and put a small pinch of white powder on his tongue. “This is a flour made from a mushroom that thinks it is a mathematician,” she said, with a pleasure she did not hide. “It will correct the error. It will also give you a terrible dream about a ladder. When you wake, you will cough once, and you will put your hand over your mouth when you do it, and you will then go to your nephew and tell him he is pretty. That will confuse every parasite you have left.”

He did as instructed. The dream dealt with a ladder that knew your sins. It was a stupid dream and he woke cursing it and then coughed into his hand and felt, for an instant, the carrier move like something dying decides to move, with dignity and offense. It passed. He went to Davi and told him he was pretty and Davi said, “Do not make jokes with your last breath,” and then realized what he had said and hit him on the arm and then hugged him hard enough to make his ribs complain, which is how men in this city say I am not ready for you to die yet.

On the thirtieth day, Aro Gaini sent a fruit Lio had never seen before with a peel like a new coin and a note that said, simply, I am counting rope. Lio cut the fruit carefully and tasted it and found it sour and delighted and a little like the first time he had learned to read a ledger without moving his lips. He took the seed out and put it in soil as if he could plant a habit.

The thirty-first day came like all days do, which is to say, stupidly in love with itself. Lio woke and counted himself alive and counted himself sick and counted himself unwilling to be either in a way that could be told as a story. He went to Sefi and she looked at him the way a person looks at a bridge before stepping on it and then stepped on it. She listened to his breath. She listened to his belly with a shell. She nodded and did not say congratulations because that is what kills men who have outrun a thing that would like to have been called destiny. She hit him, gently, with a ladle and told him not to be interesting for a week.

“Did we unhouse it,” he asked, because in the end he was a man who wanted to be told whether or not the books balanced.

“We taught it to be bored,” she said, and looked smug. “It will go find someone’s compost to be important in. Do not go to that friend’s house for a while.”

He went back into his city feeling ten percent lighter and twenty percent more aware of all the doors he had not walked through. He had two notes under his sash, one from Pell that said a new corridor had opened where an old one had used to be and did he wish to see it before anyone else did, and one from Saera that said she had made a promise in his name and could she borrow his ugly voice again that night for a smaller, pettier room. He had, briefly, the desire to throw both notes into the river and sit on a rope with his nephew and spit casually into a bucket while counting cloud-animals. He put that desire in his shirt pocket and told it he would come back for it if it behaved.

There was also a map, in his head, that had not been there a month ago, and it showed him how a city makes itself out of acts of refusal and acts of love and acts of theft and acts of paperwork. It displayed the red corridors and the rooms and the beams and the men with their stamps and their hunger. It showed him a path between a weigh-house and a child’s laugh and a Chancellor’s hand on a table and a fungus learning a name and deciding not to use it. It showed him how curiosity is a key that opens doors but also teaches you how heavy the hinges are. He walked under it and let it be his ceiling.

At the stall, Davi had hung a sign, painted badly, that said in crooked letters: we bend scales, not boys. He had put a little bell on the end of the sentence. When the wind stroked the market with its usual brazen hand, the bell rang and somebody laughed, and Lio, who had made a pact with his own mouth and had been brave about it when bravery did not require a crowd, let himself smile in the open, a plain ordinary human smile in a city that had, for a season, decided to keep him.Chapter 8

The sign Davi painted dried crooked, and then it became straight the way a city straightens a thing by repeating it. People began to say it when they haggled, and they began to hum it when they walked past the stall, and someone made a joke that did not land about lifting boys like weights and found nobody laughed. It is a small victory when a sentence refuses to be misused, and Lio watched the words he had not made but had allowed to exist do the quiet, constant work that a good sentence does when a place adopts it as a trick for remembering its spine. He let himself be pleased in that modest, suspicious way that men acquire when they find themselves on the right side of luck, and he went about his days like a clerk who has learned gymnastics.

He was busy in ways that felt like a plot and also like a life, which is to say that much of it was gathering string and keeping it from tangling. Maru made a habit of bringing objects to the stall that did not belong to stamps at all, which was how a man who preferred his expectations to be straight lines ends up with a wax lemon on his table for a day. Pell came and went and sometimes brought silence with him the way other men bring their coats; he would sit and not ask for tea and then leave Lio with a sense that something in the city had been moved four inches to the left and they would have to accommodate it. Saera, who had learned to smile like a soldier drawing a map, smiled more than she had and less than anyone would have liked, and she gave Lio errands that took him halfway into a room and then out again so that his face could be the last thing seen that was not a stamp or a fist.

Sefi kept Lio’s throat honest in the afternoons, and she refused to permit him to become a bore about it. She would teach him a new decoy when the old one had become a reflex, because the human body loves nothing more than to turn a survival into a habit, and habits are how you die of something you could have laughed away. Sometimes she sang to him in a language that was mostly water and pebbles, and sometimes she talked to him about where mushrooms decide to put their attention when they have to choose between light and a leak. He learned the taste of four teas and the names of two kinds of fear, and he found that the city had given him a new ache, the pleasant ache of having more hands than work and more work than hours and the sense that for once those two things might match.

On the fifth day after Sefi decided she would not let him die of a calendar, a chimp with coins appeared at the stall with an envelope that tried to pretend it was not an envelope. Lio recognized at once the economy of a man who has tried to teach his handwriting to pass as authority, and he opened it with the care that he usually saved for permits that had been folded and re-folded by people who did not want them to be recognized as documents. Inside was a short letter written by an official in the river’s language, which is to say it used the names of tributaries as adjectives. It said, politely and with only three errors in humans, that the Chancellor’s office had found it necessary to invent a liaison not to brag about, and that they had invented Lio with the title Liaison for Human Tallies and Sentiments, an indignity he only survived because the last word made him laugh. It said he would be required to go upriver for a week to the sorting town of Dry Claw to observe and advise while a new weigh-house found its manners, and it said he would be afforded the company of one chimp, one human clerk, and whatever boy he could not be persuaded to leave behind.

“I will be the boy,” Davi said, after reading over his shoulder like a thief. He said it in a matter-of-fact tone that did not ask permission because it had been written already in the part of his mind that writes futures on the inside of eyelids. “If you bring another boy, I will hire him and we will be two boys and you will have to feed both of us, which will be less efficient than simply bringing me at first.”

“I am not bringing a boy,” Lio said, and then surrendered to his own smile. He could not give Davi the false dignity of being called anything other than what he was, which is the person Lio brought to places where he needed laughter to see quietly. “I am bringing an insult to scales and a coil that has had too much attention from its maker, and also a tea that is allegedly medicinal and tastes like an apology.”

“Bring Maru’s silver coin,” Davi said, pointing with his chin at the place on the shelf where the stamp-woman had left it two days ago when she pretended to be a customer so that a woman who was always a customer could be served with the face better suited to women with stamps. “Bring Pell’s copper and Sefi’s worst tea. Bring your new title because it will confuse men who depend on guesses, and confusion is a delicacy in towns that think they count better than we do.”

The chimp who had delivered the letter introduced himself as Bano and tapped the coins on his belt to indicate what kind of chimp he was, which is a dialect that saves everyone the trouble of boasting. He had the face of a man who has been told he is friendly seven times in as many days and is considering whether to weaponize that fact, and his forearms had the rope-burned dignity of someone who prefers to be useful rather than seen. He offered Lio a square of pressed fruit with the solemnity of a contract, and when Lio accepted it the chimp looked relieved and stopped pretending to be anyone else. “We leave at evening when the river has bought herself back from the day,” he said, and then added, in a tone that meant he had raised children, “Bring rope shoes and a story you can tell me three times without changing a verb.”

They went light because light is how you go when you do not know whether you will have to run, and they did not tell anyone who did not need telling because secrets feed on the air and grow into animals when you let them out too often. Maru came to the ropeway to drop one sentence like a stone into a bowl and then leave the sound it made behind her. “If you make a mess in Dry Claw, make it symmetrical so I can defend it as art,” she said, and then she put a little bell in Davi’s palm and told him it had proven itself, which is not a sentence you get to hear often from a woman who counts rope for a living. Pell did not come because sometimes the most loyal thing a friend can do is not touch the rope you are about to step onto, and Saera watched from a place where her beads could not be counted as presence and adjusted her smile as if it were a strap and had to fit correctly or it would chafe.

The river smelled like what happens to a body when it remembers it is also a mouth, and even the apes were quieter on its skin because you do not talk loudly with a current under you. The barge they boarded had been a platform and then a field and then a restaurant and now it was a negotiation, which is to say it had to be kept straight not just with hands but with the tops of heads where thinking lives. Bano sat on a coil of rope as if it were a chair he had reserved, and he made his face into the kind that suggests listening without promising sympathy because primates, like cities, have learned the danger of sympathies extended without counting the teeth nearby.

Dry Claw appeared in stages, as if it were remembering itself for guests. First it was a smell of silt and oil held apart by a rumor of cinnamon. Then it was a fringe of warehouses whose shingles had learned how to be roof and advertisement, showing in their green their loyalty to certain markets and certain rules. Finally it was a city with its own fists, hands that were not Rainrut’s and had learned how to close around different coins. The ropeways were less crowded and the beams were less polite, and the gibbons sang songs with different names for jokes, which is to say that Lio had to learn how to laugh all over again.

They were met by Weigher Sister Toma, who introduced herself as if her job were her family and then proved that to be partly true by producing three young men whose eyebrows were hers and who made a point of not rolling them while she spoke. She was thin as a ledger and had the exact penchant for neatness that allows a woman to forgive messes for the sake of warmth; her belt held a pencil in a leather loop like a knife too dangerous to eat with. She looked at Lio with defended interest and at Davi with the immediate fondness certain adults save for boys who arrive in their town with rings on their fingers that are really coils pretending to be jewelry.

“We have two beams,” she said, after establishing that nobody present felt the need to embrace for show. “The west is honest. The north is only as honest as a girl in love and it has been in love with itself lately. We have a Gorilla Quartermaster who shouts in numbers and believes the contradiction makes him unsinkable. He has a stamp of his own, which we are embarrassed to admit because stamps work best when there is only one to be argued with and everybody respects it for making their lives both easier and smaller. The vine militia came through last week and moved a fence two meters toward the water and now the water has a new opinion we must talk to twice a day before it will allow our boats to lean honestly. We do not sleep much, which makes all of us braver idiots than usual.”

Davi adored her immediately because she wrapped her situation in the kind of summary that invites competent mischief. He uncoiled his coil and let it dangle, and the young men with Toma found their faces trying on looks they had expected to need five years from now and discovering they fit already. Bano made himself useful by seeing three things that were in the wrong places and putting them in the right ones while looking like he had merely adjusted his posture, and Lio let it all wash over him and caught only what his particular net was built for catching. He asked to see the beams, and then he asked to see the ledgers, and finally, to Toma’s delight and the Quartermaster’s faint sorrow, he asked to see the kitchen where the men who weighed and the men who counted were fed side by side.

Gorilla Quartermaster Ruk was the sort of official who had learned to use volume as a unit of measurement, and he made Lio’s ears itch before he made his pencil itch. He was built like a stone wall that had not been asked permission before being turned into a wall, and his eyes had that distant affection for procedure that very large men employ when they wish to avoid being persuaded. He had, it was true, a stamp of his own, and it had been carved by a human hand into a handle that made it comfortable to use, which is the kind of detail that tells you what kind of mind a town allows to hold authority.

“You are the human,” Ruk said, as if Lio had been shipped in a box labeled correctly. He did not smile, because smiles were a matter of dental display and he preferred not to be misunderstood by herbivores. “You will advise. That is a word that means I will hear you and agree with you and then do the thing I told myself I wanted to do yesterday when I was less tired and had a cleaner shirt. You will not take apart my beams. You will not open my weights and put mushrooms in them. If you think about it, I will hear the thought. Thoughts make a certain sound in this room.”

“I am very quiet when I think,” Lio said, and then amended, because he had promised himself one breakage per day of his own habits, “Unless I am talking. Then I am unbearable. Ask my nephew if you wish to be warned.” Davi nodded gravely as if he had been asked to perform a character reference, and Bano made a noise between the two that means you are not wrong but we must pretend you are for the sake of civility. “I will open nothing without you there to shame my hands, Quartermaster. I will also ask why your cooks have not been permitted to feed your weighers enough salt.”

“What,” Ruk said, flinching almost imperceptibly in the face of so small and real a sin. “What has salt to do with beams.”

“Everything,” Toma said at once, because she had already made the calculus and was waiting for an excuse to argue it with a large friend. “Everything has to do with salt if you expect a body to behave like a ledger rather than a poem. He is right and I am furious.”

They discovered in the kitchen a pan full of beans and indignity and a jug with a line on it that had been honoured even when thirst begged for mercy, which means they had decent men and bad schedules. Davi set to fixing stoves with the natural grace of a man who speaks fire the way another speaks flirtation, and he built a tiny trivet for a pot that had been balancing on a fork like a difficult sentence. Ruk hawked a cough that showed he had forgiven the insult of honesty and asked Toma if she had ever thought to hire an orangutan to cook, which she had and would have if orangutans did not prefer to cook where they could also harvest the fruit with their own hands. In the corner where buckets were made to feel important, Lio found a rack of coins used for stamps and saw in their wear and their grooves the story of how often this room had been asked to pretend it was calm.

The beams, once shown, behaved like beams when they are watched carefully. The west was true and proud in such a way that Lio found himself calling it he rather than it without noticing, and the north had learned the artful lie that comes of being asked too often to be charming. It hummed when it was corrected and whined when it was not, and Lio leaned under it with his ear nearer than a wiser man’s would have been and heard the particular protest of wood that has been in love with a particular damp. He made two notes with his sensitive part of mind and three on a paper he intended to leave in the wrong pocket of the right man’s jacket, and he asked Davi to be rude to the beam in the way only a boy who loves metal can be rude. Davi insulted its integrity and then forgave it with a new bolt, and the beam stopped being coy for an afternoon and behaved like a citizen.

Two mornings after they arrived, a paper arrived that Toma called a provocation in exactly the tone she reserved for the weather when it refused to follow the calendar. It had a neatness to it that made Ruk sniff and a seal that made Bano show his teeth without anybody calling it a smile, and it declared that a group calling themselves the Ledger Teeth had formed for the purpose of making mathematics holy again and that as a first act they would be staging a ritual before the weighers to remind everyone where the law had been written originally. It said, with the polite sangfroid of a good threat, that anyone who had been given a stamp without being born into the correct branch of a clan tree should consider himself and his future stamped in advance. It was signed with a flourish that Lio recognized from a different city on a piece of paper telling a different lie.

“They have traveled,” he said, and he did not mean the men. He meant the appetite. Saera would have been tired to her teeth at the thought of it chasing them from one town to another like a song that has found too many ears and will not leave a house until it has insulted the good furniture. “They will stage this under your beam and they will be very beautiful while they do it. If you push them, you will become the man who pushes art. If you allow them, you will become the man who allows law to be written where law has no hands.”

“I am tired of being seen,” Ruk said, and he said it with the softness of a man who is never allowed to be soft in public if he wishes to keep the room believing that it needs him. “I want to go home and eat a soup while a child complains about nothing and the floor is the only floor there is.”

“Then we will get you called away,” Lio said. He said it with the glee of a practical decision that will also irritate exactly the right person, because occasionally kindness can be made to hum like mischief. “We will give Maru a problem so attractive she cannot fail to demand your help, and you will be obligated to take your stamp elsewhere and leave me in charge with only my pencil and my obvious lack of clan tree.”

“I do not leave humans in charge,” Ruk said on reflex, because reflex is how a man makes sure he does not find himself unseated by accident. Then he remembered who he had made himself shake hands with and what that man’s ugly voice had done to laws in a different part of the rope network. He rubbed the side of his nose and rephrased. “I do not, but perhaps today I will experiment with an exception. If my house burns while I am doing a favor my wife asked me to do last week and that I ignored then and cannot ignore now, I will return and you will be ash along with the rest. You will accept this as meteorology.”

It worked because Dry Claw had already begun to learn the new habit of choosing the less interesting of two disasters, and because Maru could be made to sing into a speaking tube with a terror in her voice that men with stamps cannot resist. The Ledger Teeth arrived in finery, which is to say they had polished their wrists and cut their greed into the shape of ritual, and they discovered a quiet hall with a polite human and a chimp who pretended to be bored and a coil that rang when touched in a way that made boys laugh. They did their work anyway because men who need themselves to be believed do not cancel performances when there is no money in the jar, and they set up a little table with a blue cloth and a book that had been blank until last night when it had been kissed and then written in.

Lio despised them for their manners as much as for the knife they had in the hallway behind their smiles. He began the defense by complimenting their calligraphy, which is the most civilized crime in a room full of clerks, and he asked them to read the passage where a boy’s blood must be used to sign the page. He asked for it as if he were ordering a dish, and when the man read, his voice made a mistake and stumbled on three syllables because his mouth had never believed in blood and paper as lovers. Davi coughed with such art that it could be mistaken for a note from the coil, and one of Toma’s weighers laughed in the merciful way that means a man is going to be allowed to pretend he did not stumble.

Then Lio did the thing he had learned he could do when he had to pretend he was a person with permission. He produced a form. It was not a real form. It had been true three towns ago and three years in the future if events went the wrong way, but it was made of all the right fonts and it had a number on it that would break if anyone pulled too hard. He said, in the voice he saved for timid markets, that in order for a ritual to involve a ledger in a weigh-house one required a double attestation from the rope inspection office and the water-keepers, and that such attestation could only be given on a day when the river and the rope had agreed not to be irritable. He said the river had been savage the day after last and was therefore to be humored, which no decent person would argue, not even a man dressed in righteous linen with calligraphy on his fingers.

The Ledger Teeth huddled, because nothing undermines a liturgy like a clerk, and while they did Lio made a small show of sending Bano off with an imaginary instruction to fetch a very real woman with a stamp. He made sure the show could be seen from three angles because men in groups rarely turn all their heads the same way and you have to satisfy three consolidations of perspective to change the mind of a crowd. He stood very still after, and this time his stillness was not a performance but a prayer. The Teeth, whose ringleader had not been paid enough to endure public humiliation twice in one morning, declared that perhaps they had miscounted the moon’s permission and would return when the river had apologized to them for being a river. They left, taking their blue cloth and their book, which had never wanted to be a weapon anyway, and Toma lowered her head onto her pencil and laughed into her own shirt until she was able to find acceptance for fatigue again.

It might have been enough for a good story to end there, with men who wanted to write their law into skin put off by a piece of paper and a tone. It was not enough for a life. That evening a runner came in, breath like a torn leaf, and handed Lio a stick wrapped in a sliver of the paper only Saera and a few others used. The stick smelled like the inside of the trunk-house where Lio had swallowed his first oath, which is to say it smelled like rot and soap and a certain anxiety that has learned to look like cleanliness. Inside was a note that did not pretend to greet, and it informed him that the complaint in Rainrut had matured into a raid that was scheduled and then unscheduled and then scheduled again for the next morning when the gibbons would be loud enough to make a show of not hearing. It said Maru had put herself in the way twice and could not do it a third time without making a law out of her body, and it said a human boy with a coil who did not know yet how lucky he was to be in a city that liked him needed someone to be clever in his direction.

Davi went very quiet in the manner of a young animal listening to rain through plaster. He did not ask to stay because he had learned this past month how little begging saves and how much asking costs, and he did not reach for a coil because he had also learned that sometimes men come for coils with stamps and you have to make your hands empty for their sake. Lio read the note again and let the foul, honest taste of panic have a place in his mouth before he folded it with his usual fastidiousness and put it into the pocket where he kept the things he had to become different to survive. He looked at Bano and at Toma and then at Ruk, who had returned an hour ago smelling like onions and apology, and he asked a question that made his own neck feel like a badly oiled hinge.

“If I leave tonight,” he said, and not because he wanted permission from any man, “could you keep this house from being turned into a poem about how humans are not serious.”

Ruk looked at him in a way that suggested he had been waiting to be asked to be large in a room where subtlety was usually the correct size. “Yes,” he said, and he said it like a stamp landing. “You will owe me a thing you do not yet know the name of. You will owe me something that is not a coin. It will make your teeth itch to consider it. You will say yes anyway because you make a life out of saying yes to things that make you itch.”

“I will say yes,” Lio answered, because he had discovered that there were sentences he said now without asking his conscience to step outside. He turned to Davi and found his nephew’s face in that in-between place young men’s faces find when they are trying to be brave and do not wish to have that bravery reported back to them later, and he opened his mouth to tell him to run home without looking behind. He stopped, because when he opened his mouth he tasted the place on his tongue where the carrier had once tried to make a home, and he did not want the ghost of the thing that had almost killed him to be introduced to this instruction.

“You will go with Bano,” he said instead, framing it as an agreement between professionals. He put his hand on Davi’s shoulder with the weight of a stamp and the lightness of a bell, because that is how you put your hand on a person you love when there are people in the room who think ownership and affection are cousins. “You will carry nothing that can be argued about by a clown with a badge. You will carry a coil in your head and a joke that you will tell only to Maru when she is forced to be cruel. You will let her be cruel in the way that is useful and not in the way that is easy. You will stand on a table if you have to and show everyone your pretty wrists so that they will remember their children and be nicer men for an hour.”

“I will not let you be interesting while I am gone,” Davi said, because this was the way he measured promises to Lio, not in miles or coins but in personality traits. He made his hand into a fist and then into a bowl and then into a bird and then into nothing, and he put it on Lio’s chest as if his little show could be a blessing. He looked at Toma and at Ruk and he bowed as deeply to both as his flexible back permitted, and he did not call the Quartermaster a big tree because he had learned that flattery is cheap when it looks like flattery and expensive when it looks like dessert. “I will be back when you are bored enough to teach a beam another insult.”

Bano took him by the practical end of his elbow and they left in the kind of silence that does not ask for your opinion. Lio watched them go with the sensation of having made a decision that would be excellent in the story he would tell later and miserable for the man he was now, which is to say like most of the decent decisions he had made in the last twenty years. Ruk made a show of harrumphing and then admitted to liking the boy outright, and Toma promised to pretend not to notice the absence of his coil and then to notice it conspicuously if the Ledger Teeth tried to write a boy into a poem again.

Dry Claw felt as if all its ropes had been tightened one notch when Lio woke the next morning, and he took that as a sign that the market had chosen a tone of voice for the day that would permit him to behave as if his heart were not licking at the inside of his ribs. He spent the morning with Toma building a new habit for a man who liked his old habits, and he felt only twice the urge to run to the ropeway and bite the air until someone told him a thing he could believe. By afternoon there was a note waiting on a nail in the door of the weigh-house, and it was written in the hand of someone who writes when he must, not as a delight. It said, briefly and with the economy he had always admired in her, that Maru had kept what she could and broken nothing unnecessarily and that Davi had twice prevented a stamp from touching a face by making a joke and falling off a chair in a way that could be called performance. It said the raid had been called a training. It said the training had discovered a bent scale somewhere else and thus been delayed. It said the boy with the coil had been told by a gibbon that his wrists were wasted on fear.

Lio sat down hard on the nearest respectable plank and then stood again because men were watching him in the way men watch men who represent other men’s lists, and he did not want to be caught being human at the wrong moment. He put the paper in his shirt and let it be a piece of armor as much as a letter, and then he did what he had come to do because he believed now that the city was not going to allow him to do anything else. He went to see a man called Leeward Joon who kept the tools that measure the distance between an intention and its consequence, and he introduced himself as a liaison, because if the Chancellor had sent him the word he might as well spend it like a rich aunt’s coin.

Leeward Joon lived in a room that had been taught to be cool and had done so with flowers, and he looked at Lio with the quiet evaluation of a man who lets other people decide they need him and then charges fairly. He kept, among his gorgeous instruments, a rectangle of something bright and brittle he called the glass ladder, and when he described it his mouth did the thing religious men’s mouths do when they talk about the God they have decided to like. He said it was a skin you could walk on when you preferred to pretend you were walking on light rather than on rope, and he said it would make it easier for certain kinds of authorities to move quietly in the night with boxes that were not boxes. He said it as if it were science and not the first concrete plan Lio had encountered to take a number out of a room and turn it into a childless song.

“How far,” Lio asked, and he made his voice unimportant because it is the only way you get men like Joon to answer truthfully, “does it go when it is allowed to go.”

“As far as you can see,” Joon said, and then he smiled because he had just told a joke about optics. He added, with mercy or perhaps because he had grown fond of his own ears, “It will cross the gorge. It will make the river into a memory. It will carry beans much faster than men who have sons.”

Lio did not let his face change in any way that would tell the room that it had just become another kind of room. He asked to see the little ladders, the test-strips he could break with two fingers if he wanted to and then pretend he had not, and he inquired after the weight they could carry and the songs they did not like to hear. He made a note to visit Sefi with a question about how fungus behaves on glass, and he made another note to find out whether Maru had already seen a demonstration and had been forced to pretend she liked it. He shifted the map in his head three inches to allow for a line where a line ought not to be, and he told himself not to be afraid of the straightness of it because fear makes you step on rope wrong.

At dusk, the Ledger Teeth returned with more men and fewer women and a drum that had been polished to within an inch of its useful life. They intended a spectacle, and they were permitted to make one because even decent towns like to be entertained before they are done being decent. Lio met them with a bucket and a broom, and he offered to sweep for them if they would allow him to declare their ritual a safety hazard, and he did it in a voice so ugly and so carefully designed by Sefi to trip good manners that they laughed when they ought to have been angry. Toma had her pencil in her belt and her lads all holding paper for once rather than beans, and Ruk stood by not as a wall but as a roof, which is a different kind of protection that lets people believe there is a sky.

They sang something that had a beat like a stamp and they danced in a way that made the children delight whether or not their parents wanted them to, and then they tried to make a boy hold a pen and sign a book to make the day believe in them. The boy did not hold the pen. He had been told by a gibbon two days ago that his wrists were wasted on fear and he believed it because gibbons have that effect on very particular parts of a city’s anatomy. He looked at the Ledger Teeth with an expression he had learned from his aunt, the one that says I have made water boil with my will and you will not now make me love you because it would be convenient, and he stepped away and went behind Ruk’s leg, which is the tallest mountain any boy in Dry Claw could have had to go behind that day.

After, when the Teeth left disgusted with the taste of their own spit and the drum’s dignity compromised by the way a good broom can hum if you ask it nicely, Lio found himself breathing through a smile that needed stretching to stay. He was tired enough to let his body make the choices his brain had been correcting all day, and he found himself at the river with his shoes off for the first time in years. The stones underfoot were the old curriculum of childhood, and he walked on them until his feet stung in the way that makes certain kinds of thought leave a man alone. He held in his hand the copper Pell had given him, and he used it as an amulet against decisions made too quickly.

It was there the gibbons found him, because gibbons find people when they have begun to smell like indecision. They had made a new verse of the We Bend Scales song, and it made fun of the Ledger Teeth in a way that was not cruel but was exact. One line ended with a rhyme for a word that had no rhyme and the gibbon sang it anyway and the city decided to believe it did rhyme because it wished to applaud. Lio stood and let himself be washed with approval by a species that did not yet have to be ashamed of how loud it could make the morning. He put the copper strip to his lips like a flute and pretended he knew how to be an instrument.

When he slept, the glass ladder walked into his dream and asked to be given a permit, and he made it fill in three forms in the wrong order and it got bored and left. In the morning he woke with a sentence on his tongue that did not belong to Sefi or to Aro Gaini or to anyone who had ever asked him to sign anything, and he rinsed his mouth and practiced it under his breath until it did not sound like a threat to his own throat. He had a day’s worth of errands to do that began in Dry Claw’s kitchens and ended in Rainrut’s red corridor, and he did them with the crisp attention of a man who knows that if he lets one thread escape his fingers it will make a noose out of his city. He found himself, as he ran, thinking: I am a liaison for human tallies and sentiments, and if that is not a ridiculous title I do not know what is. He laughed aloud at his own job and then he quieted because the morning did not need an audience.

The river carried him back to Rainrut in a late light that had gone rosy with apology, and he stepped onto the home rope with the odd relief that belongs to men who have decided they secretly like being needed. There was Davi at the stall with a new sign that said nothing and a chair that shook and a grin that had, tucked behind it like a stored away apple, a story that would take two cups of bad tea to tell. There was Saera with her face like a map that had been corrected without being erased, and there was Maru with a bruise on her other side and a coin already on the table as if to answer whatever question he had not yet asked. There was Pell on a beam, looking like a gibbon’s cousin and a philosopher’s hat, and there was Sefi with a ladle tucked into her belt like a weapon the city had decided on.

He put both his palms down on the stall so the wood could remind his bones that they had returned to the correct gravity. He said the sentence he had carried all the way, because if you carry a sentence it will go rotten if you do not share it. “They are building a ladder made of glass,” he said, fitting the words together like slats on a door he intended not to open, and the stall, which does not have ears, listened anyway because it is polite when a city briefs itself. He added, because this was the part of his job nobody else had figured out they needed him for yet, “We are going to make the river say no without using words. We are going to teach glass to be afraid of mushrooms. We are going to make Quartermasters tired in a way that makes them refuse innovation out of love for sleep.”

Davi made a noise that began as a laugh and ended as a plan, and Saera rolled her beads as if they were a chorus of possible answers and indicated one with her chin that had the least blood. Maru kissed her teeth like a woman who had been given a dessert she could not pretend was good for her and informed him she would need two forms and one story and that he would owe her a day of being boring in return. Sefi tilted her ladle and said the word spores as if it were the first line of opera, and Pell scratched his jaw and said nothing because some approvals deserve to be silent.

They looked at each other for a small pocket of time, and in that pocket they found what they needed to find to make the day not a catastrophe. They were a city for a moment without any apes or humans in it, only a collection of jurisdictions and affections, and then the moment ended because someone wanted to buy a string of bells and someone else wanted a wire that would not admit to being stubborn. Lio sold a bell and wrote a form and watched Davi let a small child ring something her mother could not afford, and he felt, in his chest where nonsense lives, the peculiar happiness of being part of a place that had chosen, for the time being, to keep him.
