     "novel_text": "The night before the harbor woke, Arif dreamt of a crust flaking under his teeth, of cream splitting like pale foam across his tongue, of cinnamon and something citrus that stung the back of his throat. He woke with his palms sweating and his mouth flooded, like he\u2019d been chewing through a tide. In the dream he heard cheering and saw a ribbon he could almost grab\u2014but nothing else, just flashes. He rolled over and stared at the cracked paint above his bunk and tried to remember more, to find the edges of the dream and press.\n\nMemory, again, slipped like rainwater through his fingers.\n\nA horn grumbled outside. Diesel and brine seeped through the cabin\u2019s slatted door, along with the fry-greasy perfume of early morning warung oil, scattered laughter from the quay. The city was a giant wearing many perfumes. Smoke, cloves, dried fish. A stutter of scooters somewhere near the market alley. The boat creaked around him, the Laut Liris, which had once been a fine new phinisi and was now\u2014depending on who you asked\u2014reliable, modest, or stubborn. Her mast had a tilt that made her look like she was listening. Arif swung his legs down, toes finding cold wood and the familiar scatter of tools he always meant to tidy and never did. He rubbed at the scar behind his right ear, a little pale crescent that felt like it belonged to someone else. That scar was the start of the dark patch\u2014months missing from his head like a salt-eaten map.\n\nHe patted his shirt pocket for his cigarette tin and found, instead, the letter. It was folded and re-folded, the crease almost tearing. He smiled without meaning to. He took it out and let his eyes rest on the messily stamped logo again: Pie Nusantara\u2014Finals, Ancol Dreamland. Beneath it the lines he\u2019d already memorized.\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been selected to participate in the final round of the Pie Nusantara Eating Championship, to be held on\u2026\n\nHe could recite the date now. Three days. A number bright as a buoy marker.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t sure exactly how his name had appeared on their list, or why Lila had laughed that loud crow laugh when he showed it to her two evenings ago. \"Kau, Bang?\" She\u2019d put a hand over her mouth. \"Yes, yes, of course it\u2019s you.\" Her hair had been tucked under a scarf, her wrists inked with temporary henna that peeled at the edges. She\u2019d been slicing limes with the kind of speed that made Arif nervous. \"You forgot again?\" she asked, softening.\n\n\"I\u2026 didn\u2019t forget. I just\u2026 this is not my usual sport.\"\n\nLila had put down the knife. \"You eat like a starved colossus every time you come back from a run. I thought you would be delighted.\"\n\n\"I am,\" he\u2019d said, then immediately tasted the lie. Delight felt odd on him. Too bright for his grey mood. But carrying that letter around helped. It was a small yellow fish in his pocket.\n\nHe dressed and stepped up the companionway into the light. The sun was still low, but heat had already lifted off the concrete and the ropes. The quay of Sunda Kelapa was a long jaw with gaps in the teeth. Boats groaned, ropes cussed, men cursed at crates. Someone somewhere tuned a radio through a river of static. On the stern deck, Pak Kacek, who had never told a story without spinning it into a fable, gestured with a rope like a ringmaster. \"Arif,\" he called, instead of the usual \"Nak.\" The man had decided he was grown when they\u2019d taken the big run to Ketapang and back. \"You look like a goat chewing old paper.\"\n\n\"Dreams,\" Arif said, which was true and also safely vague.\n\n\"You were shouting. Something about lemon.\"\n\n\"Lemon?\" He laughed. \"Maybe. I don\u2019t remember.\"\n\n\"Drink something,\" Pak Kacek advised. \"It keeps the memory from drying into a husk.\" He thumbed toward a thermos the size of a child. \"Also, did you get that letter from the pie people? Lila told my wife who told me who told my neighbor, so it\u2019s very secret and private.\"\n\nArif groaned. \"Not you also.\"\n\n\"I will be your coach,\" Pak announced. \"I know about pies. During the long dry of \u201898 I sailed with a Dutchman who ate only pies. He had pies for breakfast, pies for lunch, pies for sorrow.\"\n\n\"And he survived?\"\n\n\"He died with great happiness,\" Pak said, winking. \"But he had other habits also.\"\n\nArif took the thermos, drank until the metallic tea hit the back of his nose. He breathed and watched the lace of gulls. The letter sat like a tame bird in his pocket. He tried to imagine standing under a white tent with people cheering as he shoved pastry into his mouth. If he squinted, he could almost see it. But it was like trying to focus on fish below the surface. Bends of light, shimmering edges, nothing you could grab.\n\nBy midmorning, they\u2019d unloaded the last of the crates. Durians thumped onto the dock like grenades. A child darted between a stack of coconuts and almost broke his toes. Arif shouted, the boy heard him and scowled. \"Bang, you shout like my mother.\"\n\n\"Then your mother is wise,\" Arif said, and the boy scampered off, tongue stuck out.\n\nHe worked like he always did, hands and body to the wood, shoulders stitched with a steady ache that felt honest. Work placed him somewhere the holes couldn't go. At noon, he slung his bag over his shoulder and made for the warungs outside the Port gate. Lila would be there with her lemon drinks and fish cakes, a stubborn bird in a metal nest. The alleys to the warungs were a world unto themselves. A cat slept on a plate. Radios argued. Fish scales glinted like money on the ground.\n\nLila\u2019s stall was a tin rectangle with a banner that read: Es Jeruk Lila\u2014Manis, Asam, Selamat. She\u2019d added the last word as a joke after three men fake-coughed about health inspections. \"Selamat is good to say,\" she\u2019d explained. \"It covers everything. Hello, safe, congratulations, you not dying today.\"\n\n\"Where is my champion?\" she asked when she saw him, and raised both arms as if he was a triumphant hero returning from battle.\n\n\"Not a champion yet.\"\n\n\"Last year you were so humble also. And then\u2014\" She cut herself off, the smile slipping. \"Sorry.\"\n\nHe blinked. \"Last year what?\"\n\n\"Eat,\" she said, changing. \"Try this new one. I put salt on the rim. Fancy like an expensive place.\"\n\nHe accepted the glass, cold as ice. The salt bit his chapped lips and the sweet lemon washed in, and he had a sharp, hauling tug in his mind, a small sound like a curtain ring sliding. He looked at Lila\u2019s face and it had gone careful. She placed a plate of banana fritters in front of him and used the back of her wrist to wipe her forehead. A fly alighted and she flicked it away, fierce.\n\n\"What did you mean just then,\" he asked. \"Last year\u2026\"\n\n\"You won,\" she said simply. \"Pie Nusantara. You won it. You wore a garland that made you look like a flower. We ate free for a week because all the bakeries wanted to touch my hand. People asked me for selfies because \u2018you\u2019re the cousin of the champion.\u2019 Useless fame, but fame.\"\n\nThe world went slightly soft at the edges, as if he\u2019d stood up too quickly. Arif set the glass back down slowly. The salt rim left a little crown on the wood. \"But I\u2014\"\n\n\"I know,\" Lila said. \"You don\u2019t remember. You remember the race to Pramuka Island, the storm, you remember smacking your head on the bar of the hatch. You remember waking up three days later. You remember me with my hair like a nest and the doctor with his eyes like fried egg. But not\u2026 you don\u2019t remember that week. It went from you. That is how it goes sometimes with heads. You knew for a while after\u2014you remembered for a week, maybe two\u2014then it began to slide. I thought it would come back after Ramadan. It didn\u2019t.\"\n\nArif swallowed and felt the swallow all the way down. It slotted into a dark corner like a puzzle piece. He waited for the embarrassment to arrive and give him a slap. Instead, something else rose. A little bubble of relief. He had kept the feeling that he was missing important things, and here was one, returned to him with Lila\u2019s flat voice and lemon scent. And yet it was terrible. He could not find the memory itself, only the shape it must have left behind.\n\n\"You didn\u2019t tell me,\" he said.\n\n\"You would not have wanted me to pull at it.\" She raised her chin. \"Besides, I told you two months ago. You looked at me like you were watching a show through a wall. I decided I was done pushing.\"\n\nHe let out a long breath. \"I am sorry.\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t say that to me like a prayer. We have other things to say.\" Lila placed both her palms on his hands. Her fingers were sticky with sugar syrup. \"Three days to the final. You got the invitation because you\u2019re the defending champion. The organizer also snapped his finger, said \u2018the audience love a story with a return,\u2019 the way people like to snap. Are you okay with that? I didn\u2019t want to decide for you. I could have hidden the letter. I didn\u2019t. Maybe I am a bad person.\"\n\nHe snorted. \"You are not a bad person.\" He stared at their hands. \"I want to do it. I think\u2014I think there\u2019s a rope attached to it that leads back into the dark. Maybe I can pull.\"\n\n\"Or you can just eat pies and make money. Let me keep my romance narratives for karaoke.\"\n\nHe laughed then, and some tightness loosened. He ate the fritters, and he pretended his heart wasn\u2019t beating quickly. Lila had that effect. She made his problems look like fish that could be netted.\n\nHalfway through his second plate, a man with a comb-over and a shirt printed with tiny anchors approached the stall like a ship sidling. \"You are Lila?\"\n\n\"I am sometimes,\" Lila said, that friendly-sharp tone she had with customers she did not like yet.\n\n\"I\u2019m Satria,\" the man said. \"From Pie Nusantara. The schedule changed. We had a cancellation. Can you come to registration this evening instead of tomorrow?\" He pointed at Arif without looking at his face, paperwork heavier in his hand. \"Our champ.\" He winked like he had learned about winking from old films.\n\nArif did not know whether to be angry that he was being called \u201cour champ\u201d like a pet or amused. \"Today?\"\n\n\"At seven. Mariana Tent. Ancol. Bring your manager.\"\n\n\"Manager?\" Arif echoed, glancing at Lila.\n\n\"She is the manager, right?\" Satria smiled. \"We read the blogs. Everybody loves this cousin story. Very heartwarming. You arrive at the pier together, glorious.\"\n\n\"We are not dogs,\" Lila said mildly.\n\n\"I\u2019ll see you there,\" Satria said, already backing away, body turned half to another stall. \"We will give you the new rule sheet. Please don\u2019t be late. Big sponsor involved. We want to make good impression. Many cameras.\"\n\n\"Many cameras,\" Lila repeated after he left, rolling her eyes. \"Bang, I want you to do this for yourself. Not for Satria\u2019s cameras.\"\n\n\"For myself,\" he said. \"Yes.\" He wasn\u2019t sure if that was true, but it felt right to say out loud. Maybe the truth followed the words like a machine.\n\nThe day carried him like a boat caught by current. He went back to the Liris to check on a balky bilge pump and argue about ropes with Paiman, who believed in square knots like they were religion. He tried to lift pieces of memory in the spare minutes\u2014last year, the week of the contest, the crowd. He got flashes that felt borrowed: something bright, confetti, a boy holding a pie like a steering wheel, Lila crying then laughing immediately. He let them come and pass, like unfamiliar fish in a tank.\n\nAt five, he changed his shirt, combed his hair with a spoon because he couldn\u2019t find his comb, and met Lila outside the gate. She\u2019d washed her face and put on lipstick that made her look like her mother, who had been a singer on a ferry once, and who now lived in Depok with a man who owned three mahjong sets and a smile like a shutter you couldn\u2019t open.\n\n\"Look at you,\" Lila said. \"You look like a nice boy.\"\n\n\"I will ruin it by eating pies like a wild dog.\"\n\n\"You will eat them like a gentleman.\"\n\nThey caught a bus that complained the whole way to Ancol, and watched the city unfold out of the glass. Old neighborhoods with low, tired houses. New towers like spears. A billow of black clouds in the west that promised storm and delivered none. At a red light, a vendor threaded through a line of cars selling tissue boxes, and a small man in a pink helmet passed them on a tiny motorbike carrying a roll of foam as big as a crocodile. Jakarta in all its improbable balance stood around them, and Arif felt a small pride that he belonged to it, even if he belonged like a scar belongs to skin.\n\n\"You won last year,\" he said again, softly, to the window.\n\n\"You did,\" Lila said.\n\n\"Nothing comes. Just the feeling of a hundred hands in the air.\"\n\n\"Maybe you only remember the part that mattered.\"\n\nAncol was sunset light on water, the air full of popcorn noise and ferris wheel joy. Kids dragged balloons like weak moons. There were tents already up, the Mariana a big white thing with scalloped edges and banners with pies bigger than faces printed on them. Arif saw a blond tourist woman biting into a durian tart and making a face like a cat smelling a lemon. He grinned without meaning to.\n\nSatria met them, his anchor shirt now somehow tighter. He had a clipboard and a radio and the expression of a man everyone would ignore. \"Ah! You came. Good.\" He led them through a side flap, past a row of tables covered in cloth the color of teeth, and pointed to an area with a coffee machine. \"Registration first. Then the sponsor will want a word. He has this idea about making the pies\u2026 never mind. He talks. You stand there and nod.\"\n\n\"Who is the sponsor?\" Lila asked.\n\n\"Blue Heron Hospitality. Their new club is near Kota Tua. Exclusive. They want coverage. They are paying for those camera cranes.\"\n\nArif felt a little twist. Blue Heron. He had heard that name snapped from someone\u2019s mouth on the quay. A new place, hidden door, quiet men. He tucked the twist away.\n\nThey filled out forms that asked him about his allergies and his signature and his shoe size, for no reason he could imagine. A girl with purple hair took Lila\u2019s photo and gave her a laminated badge. \"Manager,\" it read, and below it, \"Lila Adidarma,\" spelled almost right.\n\n\"Are we selling lemonade here too?\" Lila asked Arif as she examined the badge.\n\n\"You could,\" he said. \"There\u2019s always a line of people who want sour.\"\n\nThey followed Satria to a low platform where a man in a linen jacket and loafers waited, his hair careful. He had a smile like he practiced it in the mirror. \"Arif,\" he said. \"I\u2019m Gerry. We are very happy to see you back.\" His English had a California lean to it. \"Your story is\u2026 compelling. Man of the sea, the return, the amnesia\u2014\"\n\n\"I didn\u2019t say the word \u2018amnesia\u2019 to you,\" Lila cut in.\n\nGerry widened his practiced smile. \"Everyone knows everything in this city.\" He brought his palms together with a clap. \"I own the Blue Heron. We\u2019re throwing the after-party. I want you to be the first to arrive. Photograph the moment. Our designer made you a jacket.\"\n\n\"A jacket,\" Arif repeated, flat.\n\n\"Gerry loves to dress people,\" Satria said, lifting his eyes to the ceiling. \"Last year he dressed the contestants like pirates. It made sponsors cry.\"\n\n\"Pirates are charming,\" Gerry protested. \"Almost as charming as sailors who can eat pastries like machines. Arif, can we take a photo? Just you and the Blue Heron banner. We\u2019ll just get some\u2026 content. We\u2019ll post. People will come. Everybody\u2019s happy.\"\n\nArif nodded because he couldn\u2019t see how to say no without making Lila\u2019s life harder. He stood against a blue cloth with a painted white bird on it and tried to look\u2026 something. He imagined the taste of lemon again and opened his mouth to mimic what he thought might be confidence. The camera clicked, and then two more times, and then Gerry grabbed his shoulder like a friend. \"Wonderful. We love authenticity.\"\n\nOn their way out, Lila touched his arm and pointed. Near the exit flap was a board with photos pinned on, last year\u2019s winners and the year before, with captions. There he was. No question. Mouth smeared with filling, hair messier than now, eyes lit as if someone had switched them on from behind. He wore a garland made of pastry leaves. He was laughing, shoulder to shoulder with a stout woman in a headscarf who had won second. He was somebody in that photo. He was also a stranger.\n\n\"Look at you,\" Lila whispered.\n\nHe looked. He remembered nothing from that exact arrangement of atoms, not the angle of the garland on his collarbone, not the shape of the tent behind him. But his chest drew tight in a way that resembled joy. He reached out and his fingertips touched the edge of the photo. It was warm from the tent\u2019s light. He wondered if touching a picture could pull the memory out of the paper like oil from a rope.\n\n\"Those are good times,\" a voice said behind them. Arif turned to find an old woman in an apron, face seamed and eyes bright. \"You are the boy. The one who ate all my apple pies.\" Her chuckle was a rustling sound. \"I had to make more. You dropped your trophy and laughed like a donkey.\"\n\n\"I did?\" He grinned. \"I would never drop a trophy.\"\n\n\"You were shaking with sugar,\" she said. \"We thought you would die and make bad publicity. But you lived.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\" Lila asked.\n\n\"Bu Dewi. I bake. I baked at my husband for thirty years. He still didn\u2019t rise.\" She hooted at her own joke. \"You will come by tomorrow. I have durian tart. I make it so it doesn\u2019t smell like socks.\"\n\n\"We will come,\" Lila promised.\n\nBy the time they spilled out into the lights of the park, it was full dark, the ferris wheel LEDs cycling through blues that made the water look like metal. Arif\u2019s head hummed. He needed to sit. Instead, Lila tugged at his sleeve. \"Before we go,\" she said, \"I have to meet someone. Five minutes.\" She ducked into a pocket of shadow near a vendor selling ice cream shaped like fish. \"I\u2019ll be right back.\"\n\n\"Who, at this hour?\" He tried to joke. \"Your secret rich boyfriend?\"\n\nShe put a hand on his chest and pushed. \"Don\u2019t be an uncle. Wait. Get me a fish ice cream. The red bean one, not chocolate. I\u2019ll be back before it melts.\"\n\nHe watched her slip into a narrower corridor between tents, where cables lay like snakes. She was steady on her feet, small but strong. He bought two ice creams anyway, hands cold, eyes tracking the space where she had disappeared. He waited through a whistle blown by a man selling balloons, through a song played by a busker with a broken string, through a minute and then five. He bit the tail off one of the fish and let sweet red paste meet his tongue. He checked the time on the dead face of his watch and then remembered it had stopped at three seventeen three weeks ago.\n\nHe went round to the back of the tents. The corridor was dim but not empty, workers moving crates, a woman on a phone saying \"I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\" over and over. He found the spot where he thought Lila had turned and looked. Empty. He called her name and a man shushed him because people were filming nearby. He went farther, glanced behind equipment cases, pushed open a flap that led to a space of ladders and buckets. Nothing. Anger pricked then concern swallowed it.\n\nA cleaner leaned on his broom, watching Arif peer around like a cat. \"Bang, you lose something?\"\n\n\"My cousin. She came through here. Scarf, gray jacket. Pretty, would hit you with her words if you were stupid.\"\n\n\"Many pretty girls with gray jackets,\" the cleaner said, bored, then frowned, thoughtful. \"There was a girl talking to a man in a blue jacket. Like sea blue. Not police, club type. He had a bird on his sleeve. Blue bird.\" He gestured with his broom. \"They went toward the back gate.\"\n\nHe imagined Lila rolling her eyes at a man with a jacket and walking away. But the cleaner\u2019s face made something shrivel. \"Blue Heron,\" Arif said.\n\n\"Yes, Bang. New place. Very expensive. My cousin says they make drinks like perfume.\"\n\nArif balanced the two melting fish-shaped ice creams and walked toward the back gate. His mouth was dry again in a way that no lemon could touch. The gate led onto a service road with a row of trucks. No sign of Lila. He called her name again and a dog barked somewhere. A shadow moved and vanished. The ice cream began to make a sticky river onto his fingers. He threw one fish away into a bin. He kept the other, superstitious.\n\nHe flagged an ojek with a whistle, and the driver, a boy with hair he\u2019d dyed white at the tips, pulled up, cocky. \"Where, Bang?\"\n\n\"Kota Tua. Blue Heron club.\"\n\n\"Sudah malam, Bang. It\u2019s expensive.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not buying it,\" Arif snapped, climbed onto the back anyway. \"Just drive.\"\n\nJakarta at night was a neon river and a patience test. The bike slid through jams and around buses that wheezed exhaust into their faces. Arif pressed his palm against his pocket and felt the letter like a talisman. He had a sudden image of Lila looking unimpressed at an expensive chandelier, of her finger poking a waiter\u2019s chest, of her making a joke the wrong man didn\u2019t think was funny. He shook his head. Lila was not someone who vanished. Lila was a person who filled the air with her opinions and left sugar on your fingers. Fear kept trying to find a chair in him and he refused to let it sit.\n\nKota Tua had its ghost look on, the old buildings lit up and hollow, like stage sets. Arif told the driver to stop before the square. He paid, including for the boy\u2019s grievance about the hour, and walked along a side street where a man with a hat sold cigarettes from a briefcase. The Blue Heron\u2019s door was not a door. It was a piece of wall a man would ignore if he didn\u2019t know what he was seeing. A very tall doorman stood in front of it, his suit too perfect. A thin blue heron silhouette in metal was set into the cement, no signage. No need.\n\n\"Member?\" the doorman asked, eyes sliding over Arif\u2019s work-worn clothes with professional disdain.\n\n\"My cousin is inside. Lila. She came with a man with a bird on his sleeve.\"\n\nThe doorman barely blinked. \"We can check.\" He had the voice of a man who knew people always had urgent reasons that were not enough. He touched his earpiece, said something, waited for static to answer. \"No Lila in our system.\"\n\n\"She would not give her name to your system. She would give you an argument.\" Anger rose, useful because it gave him a spine. \"Let me go inside and look. Two minutes. Less.\"\n\n\"We don\u2019t do that.\"\n\n\"I am not asking for champagne, brother.\"\n\n\"Still no.\"\n\nArif set his jaw. He considered, for a hot silly second, punching the doorman. He considered the chalk of the man\u2019s jaw and the weight of his fists. He let the thought pass like a cloud. He took the fish-shaped ice cream from his left hand\u2014the thing you forget you\u2019re holding when everything else is on fire\u2014and pushed it into the doorman\u2019s palm. The man stared at it, genuinely startled. \"Please,\" Arif said. \"I don\u2019t have time to make you a story.\"\n\nA woman\u2019s voice slid in from behind the doorman. \"What is this?\"\n\nShe was all sharp edges and silk, eyeliner making her eyes look like they had been drawn by a calligrapher. She wore a dress the color of tamarind and a smile you could cut bread with. \"I like fish,\" she said, looking at the melting ice cream in the doorman\u2019s hand. \"Who are you, sailor?\"\n\n\"Arif,\" he said. \"My cousin. She\u2019s missing.\"\n\n\"Missing from your sight or missing from the world? Because men love to claim women are missing when they are simply elsewhere.\"\n\nArif looked at the line of her mouth and chose his words carefully. \"Missing from where she said she would be. She doesn\u2019t do that. A man in a blue jacket took her. Your people wear those jackets.\"\n\n\"They do,\" she said. \"What is your cousin\u2019s name?\"\n\n\"Lila.\"\n\n\"And your name is Arif,\" she repeated, as if testing for lies tasted on the tongue. \"Are you the pie boy?\"\n\nHe blinked. \"Apparently.\"\n\n\"I watch television on mute,\" she said. \"It keeps my brain company. You look better in person. Come in for five minutes,\" she told the doorman, who shrugged very slightly like he thought this was foolish but also not his job to challenge. \"If you break anything, you pay for it.\" She took the melting fish from the doorman and licked it once, precise, like a cat. \"Delicious. Red bean. Intrepid choice.\"\n\nInside, Blue Heron was a different country. Soft light, tables like lagoons, a bar that looked like the inside of a piano. Men in indigo suits and women in dresses that moved like water and smelled like money. A jazz trio unspooled a song that made Arif want to cry for no reason he could say out loud. He scanned faces. A waitress with a tray saw him and frowned at his boots.\n\nThe woman in tamarind dress walked slightly ahead. \"I am Dara,\" she said. \"I own thirty percent of this place, which means I own the right to regret thirty percent of my decisions. Look left, not right. If you look right, someone will think you want their attention. You do not.\"\n\n\"Have you seen Lila?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have not. Why would your cousin come here?\"\n\n\"Maybe to meet someone. Maybe because this place has become the center point on some men\u2019s maps.\"\n\nDara\u2019s mouth lifted slightly at a corner. \"You read maps?\"\n\n\"I live in them.\"\n\nShe stopped near the bar and nodded at the bartender. \"Send someone to check the private rooms. A woman named Lila. Small, eyes like knives.\" She turned to Arif. \"There is someone you should meet, while we wait. Not because I think you like making friends. Because I am curious.\"\n\nShe led him to a table half in shadow where a man sat with a glass of something golden and a notebook. He looked ordinary until he looked at you, and then he didn\u2019t. His eyes were the color of the water right before it turns into storm. He smiled without showing his teeth. \"This is Bram,\" Dara said. \"He sits in corners and makes connections where none exist, which is a talent and a mental illness.\" She slid into the booth opposite him and left no room for Arif to hesitate. He slid in.\n\n\"Bram, the champion who forgot his championship,\" Dara said. \"Arif.\"\n\nBram\u2019s gaze snapped a little. \"You have stitches behind your ear,\" he said, like he was noting the weather. \"You walk like a man who favors his left knee. What did you lose?\"\n\n\"A cousin,\" Arif said. \"Lately. And other things before.\"\n\n\"Pie memory,\" Dara said, accepting a drink that appeared without being ordered. \"Your hobby has become community knowledge.\"\n\nArif put his hands on the table to keep them from fisting. \"Can your man find her or not?\"\n\nBram nodded at Dara. \"Private rooms empty.\"\n\nDara shrugged, as if to say so much for that. \"We checked the cameras outside,\" she added, a beat later, and Arif tried to decide if she said that to comfort him or to irritate him. \"This place watches itself. Nobody matching her description came in.\"\n\n\"Then she never reached this door,\" Arif said. \"Somewhere between the tent and here she went missing.\" The word felt like it belonged to someone else, but he said it again because it was correct. \"Missing.\"\n\n\"You are sure she didn\u2019t decide to take a detour with a man who does not know you exist?\" Dara asked.\n\n\"Lila likes men who say what they mean and wear un-ironed shirts. This is not her place.\" He heard the dangerous thread in his voice and gentled it. \"Please.\"\n\nDara studied him over the rim of her glass. \"Men who ask nicely are rare here.\" She set the glass down. \"Bram will help. He owes me, because last year he broke a light with his elbow. Also because I am bored.\"\n\nBram smiled slightly, his gaze on Arif\u2019s face. \"Tell me everything you noticed,\" he said. \"Start with the moment you last saw her. Every color, every trivial sound. Don\u2019t try to decide what is important. I will decide what is important.\"\n\nArif closed his eyes. He smelled lemon still, as if the scent had marked him, or he had been marked with it. He saw the ice cream vendor\u2019s fish and the woman on the phone saying I don\u2019t know and the cleaner chewing his words into thought. He described the man with the blue sleeve with the bird because the cleaner had said it, even though he, Arif, hadn\u2019t seen it with his eyes. He gave them the way the cables lay on the ground. He gave them the laughter of a girl, a laugh that wasn\u2019t Lila\u2019s. He gave them the way the wind had pushed the tent flap open, one-two, like someone calling a dog.\n\nBram listened like a priest. Dara watched the room with her eyes but her body listened. \"Blue jacket with bird,\" Bram said after a while. \"We can find that bird. It is not a common sin.\"\n\n\"You are certain it was the Blue Heron logo?\" Dara asked.\n\n\"The cleaner told me it was a bird,\" Arif said. \"He called it a blue bird. A heron is a blue bird.\"\n\n\"Many birds are blue,\" Dara said. \"But my men do wear the heron. And some of them are stupid enough to take liberties with it. If a cousin of a champion\u2019s cousin was to be taken, it would not be for ransom. It would be for a message. Or a mistake. Either makes men sloppy.\"\n\nArif turned, too quickly, and the whiskey smell whipped at his face. \"Taken,\" he repeated.\n\n\"Let us not say the worst thing loud yet,\" Dara advised. \"Let us say lost in the folds of night. For now. Bram, go look at the cameras around the park. Call Rahim. He owes us for the thing with the red scooter. Do it now.\"\n\nBram slid out of the booth with no wasted movement, already tapping messages. \"He looks like nothing,\" Dara said, watching him walk. \"That is his mask. You need to put on a better mask, Arif.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t like masks.\"\n\n\"There is your problem.\"\n\n\"One of them,\" he agreed.\n\nHe stood then because sitting had begun to feel like betrayal. \"I have to go back to the park. To see for myself. Hang up the sheets in my head and see what sticks to them.\"\n\n\"I will send someone with you,\" Dara said. \"Not to babysit. To help you ask the right kind of questions. Don\u2019t look at me like that. You don\u2019t know which questions are wrong until a wrong person hears them.\"\n\n\"I can handle wrong people.\"\n\n\"Everyone believes that until the wrong person smiles.\"\n\nHe almost smiled back at that because it was painfully true. \"Thank you,\" he said instead. He bowed his head in a way that made his grandmother\u2019s voice rise up in him with a scold about superstition and gratitude. Outside, the city pressed its ear against the wall and listened to him breathe. Inside, a trio played a song that had no patience with fear. Dara watched him with eyes that had paid for a lot of light.\n\n\"Before you go,\" she said softly, \"one question.\"\n\nHe waited.\n\n\"Do you want to win this thing again?\" Her chin tipped slightly toward the direction where the Ancol tents sat, invisible through walls but somehow loud in his head.\n\nHe realized his hands had pressed into fists on the table again. He forced the fingers to open. \"I do,\" he said, and he let himself hear what that sounded like. \"But not more than I want to find her.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she said, as if he had answered a riddle correctly. \"You are not an idiot, then. That will make your life more complicated and also longer. Go.\"\n\nHe went. The doorman gave him back his red bean fish, now half frozen again by some miracle, because the club was the sort of place where even melting could be paused. Arif looked at it and laughed, short and sharp, and bit into it. He walked back out into the night with his mouth full of sweetness and fear, the letter in his pocket, and the taste of something old at the back of his throat that might have been memory beginning to thaw. He did not run, because running makes men who watch think you are prey. But he moved fast, because not running keeps men who love you stuck in places that make no sense.\n\nHe reached the park and went around the back again. The cleaner was gone; a new one had replaced him, a girl with a scarf and a too-big broom who looked fourteen. \"Bang?\" she said when he asked. \"I saw a woman like that. She went into the side tent with a man who talked like a radio.\" She blinked. \"He had a tattoo of a feather behind his ear.\"\n\nArif\u2019s hand went to his own scar without his say-so. He felt that silly crescent like a doorbell. He thanked her and slid into the dark between two tents, like slipping between pages of a book. Inside the side tent, he found nothing but ladders and a plastic chair and the ghost of someone\u2019s perfume. He stood very still, let his breath settle, and listened. A fan, moving tired air. The brittle sleep of the city. Distant, the crash of a ride. Closer, a hum of a fridge.\n\nAnd there, inexplicably small among all the noises, a chime. A phone. One note, then two, then another. It was a ringtone he knew, silly and bell-like, because Lila refused to change it, said it made her feel like her life still had games in it. He turned toward the sound like a plant, careful not to knock anything, and it grew slightly louder to the left. He moved a stack of folded tarpaulins and there, slipped between them like a bright fish, was her phone. Screen cracked, still lighting up a notification. Blue Heron: Your reservation is confirmed. 8:30pm. Private Room A.\n\nHe stared at it too long. It chimed again and showed another message, from a number unknown. Bring what you promised. Do not be late.\n\nHe did not let himself panic. That would be as useful as shouting at the tide for wetting your shoes. He put Lila\u2019s phone in his pocket and felt it next to the letter, two rectangles warm from his touch. Then he turned and left the tent the way he had come, quiet as he could manage. Outside, the park had thinned but not gone to sleep. The ferris wheel had gone empty and then filled again with teenagers pretending not to be afraid. The smell of fried dough walked by on a man\u2019s tray. Arif breathed once, twice, and went to find Bram with the eyes like storm water and the woman with a laugh like a blade and a club named for a bird that stood in shallow water waiting to spear something.\n\nHis mouth tasted like red bean and salt. He thought of the photograph on the board, of himself with pie on his face, and could not find that man in his skin, yet. But he remembered\u2014finally, as if a small stubborn door had opened\u2014a fragment. The sound from the dream, of cheering. And the feel of a ribbon\u2019s raw edge under his thumb.\n\nIt was small, but it was something. He clung to it the way a small boat clings to a channel of calm in the strait, knowing the tide can turn hard and early, and prayed to no one that Lila was not further out than he could row.3\n\nHe found Bram before he found Dara, which he decided was luck disguised as efficiency. The man with eyes like storm water had claimed a table near the tent\u2019s perimeter and was making a small nest of receipts and cigarette papers, arranging and rearranging as if the pattern would reveal something if only he respected it enough. When Arif put Lila\u2019s phone on the tabletop, Bram did not reach for it immediately. He looked up at Arif\u2019s face, as if the state of that geography was the more telling artifact.\n\n\u201cShe left it,\u201d Arif said, and the ease with which he could tell the truth scared him more than a lie might have. \u201cIn the side tent, under tarpaulins. It was on when I found it. It\u2019s got a message.\u201d\n\nBram slid the phone to him and held it between his fingers like a playing card. He turned it so it lit his own face from below and read. \u201cReservation confirmed,\u201d he murmured. \u201cPrivate Room A. Blue Heron. And then\u2014\u2018Bring what you promised.\u2019\u201d He lifted a brow. \u201cDoes she have a habit of promising things to strangers?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe promises everything to everyone with a straight face,\u201d Arif said. \u201cAnd then she keeps the ones worth keeping. For this\u2026 she could have promised syrup, lemons, a recipe, a contact. She could have promised to sing a song so badly it breaks glass. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nDara arrived with a corona of cold air like she had brought the inside of the club with her in her hair. She sat without asking if the seat was taken and took the phone out of Bram\u2019s hand the way a teacher takes chalk. \u201cOur reservation system uses an initial code for all holds,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can look up who created this. Private Room A belongs to me. If someone has used it without asking, I will break his wrists and invoice him for the plaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not have to be your place,\u201d Arif began, but Dara was already waving at someone in the shadows and speaking into a small device hidden in her palm, her voice lowering to that silk-threat he had already recognized. Bram half smiled.\n\n\u201cShe did not want to be tracked,\u201d Bram said softly. \u201cYour cousin. She left this where it would be found by someone like you and not a man with a flashlight who looks without seeing. She knows where you look.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe also knows when to ask me to buy her ice cream like I am her servant,\u201d Arif said, and felt his mouth twist into a shape that wasn\u2019t quite a smile and wasn\u2019t quite anything else. \u201cThe cleaner saw a man with a feather tattoo behind his ear.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot my heron,\u201d Dara said, already irritated on behalf of her brand. \u201cWe do not allow our staff to be marked like cattle. They prefer to mark their souls with debt.\u201d She touched her ear as if checking for a phantom feather and shook her head. \u201cRahim has pulled the external cameras for the park. We have a view on the back gate and breakdown lane.\u201d\n\nBram put the phone back on the table and flattened a receipt beside it. \u201cBefore we leave, tell me everything else you have not told me. Quickly. It will save us an hour later and perhaps your cousin a bruise.\u201d\n\nArif spoke fast, because he could, because he had learned on boats to make your mouth as efficient as your hands when the weather changed suddenly. He gave him the vendor girl with the broom and the radio voice and the fact that the feather sat behind his ear like a secret tucked by a lover. He gave him the cleaner\u2019s boredom built into helpfulness. He spoke Lila\u2019s ringtone into the air and heard Dara make an approving noise, as if an absurd detail was a correct coin placed on the correct counter.\n\nDara stood, impatient with chairs. \u201cWe can do more from a screen than from a table,\u201d she declared. \u201cCome.\u201d\n\nThey moved like a small river cutting through a bigger one, making their own channel through the back of the tent, past men in headsets with that grim look of people who make community out of noise, past a mountain of paper plates and a woman who hid a yawn behind a ladle. In a corner where the tent wall folded into itself, a young man hunched over a laptop with cables sprouting from it like vines. He glanced up when Dara\u2019s shadow fell on his keyboard and visibly straightened his spine.\n\n\u201cBack gate, twenty minutes back,\u201d Dara said. \u201cAnd the vendor paths. And the service road. Give me everything you can pull that won\u2019t feed anyone else\u2019s curiosity before mine.\u201d\n\nThe screen offered a black-and-white world before it offered anything else. Arif was briefly furious that the night had been reduced to flat gray and the shapes of people turned to figures without faces. Then one of the figures was unmistakable, head forward, the little seesaw of her arms when she was moving quickly without wanting to run. Lila slipped along the edge of the tent, paused, looked back as if she had left a seasoning behind and needed to remember it. A man came into the frame a second later, jacket dark, with a cut that suggested money and patience. He did not touch her. He gestured with two fingers, like a conductor inviting a quiet instrument in.\n\n\u201cThat is one of ours,\u201d Satria said, appearing at Arif\u2019s elbow as if conjured by his own guilt. He had approached on soft feet with a cup of coffee that smelled like it had been waiting too long for a mouth. \u201cThe jacket. Owner\u2019s sponsor team gave two to their activation boys. I told them the brand rules, but you know sponsors. They want to be seen without being seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNames,\u201d Dara said, without turning her head.\n\n\u201cJonas,\u201d Satria said immediately. \u201cAnd maybe Tomo. I don\u2019t know the second. Jonas is a contractor. He knows everything about everything but only after it has already happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes Jonas have a feather behind his ear?\u201d Bram asked.\n\nSatria had the grace to look like a boy in a classroom who had been asked about the poem he didn\u2019t read. \u201cI don\u2019t look at boys\u2019 ears,\u201d he said weakly, then grimaced when Dara\u2019s mouth simply went thinner. \u201cMaybe he does. He\u2019s with\u2014sometimes he works with Tawa Promotions. They do clubs. They did Blue Heron\u2019s opening party. He has a\u2026 tall girlfriend. An actress.\u201d\n\nOn the screen, Lila and the man with the expensive patience slipped out of the camera\u2019s view. The feed switched to the service road, where a golf cart with the words \u201cMariana\u201d stenciled on its side in a script that wanted to be elegant and wasn\u2019t swung into view. The driver wore a cap low. The man in the jacket got in beside him. Lila got in the back like someone who resented the fact of transport. The cart pulled away and out of frame.\n\n\u201cMariana,\u201d Arif said. \u201cLike the tent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tent,\u201d Satria said. \u201cThe caterer. They run food to the sponsor lounge and move chairs when chairs need moving. That cart is theirs.\u201d\n\nDara\u2019s phone breathed against her palm. She lifted it and read and for once did not narrate to make a point. \u201cThe reservation was made by a code belonging to an external vendor,\u201d she said after a beat. \u201cSomebody who, for tonight, belongs to us and tomorrow belongs to someone else. They put it under a generic name and figured our systems would simply accept the shape of a request because the right letterheads were sniffing around. They were not wrong. Private Room A did not open. But the promise was made by someone who believed it would.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere does Mariana store their chairs when chairs are sleeping?\u201d Bram asked Satria, who blinked and looked like he would rather swallow his radio than answer.\n\n\u201cThey have a yard near the northern fence,\u201d Satria said, then tried to qualify it. \u201cIt\u2019s where all the vendors put their skeletons. There\u2019s a gate to the service canal.\u201d\n\nArif tasted lemon again without putting anything in his mouth. \u201cThe canal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you wanted to take something or someone away from a maze with two thousand eyes, you would do it where the fishes keep their counsel.\u201d\n\nDara gave him a look that said perhaps he would have been a poet if he had a different grandmother. \u201cGo,\u201d she said. \u201cBram, take two of our boys and your brain. Satria, you are not invited. Every time you speak tonight, something foolish leaves your mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Satria said, then closed his mouth because for once he had chosen the correct thing to do with it.\n\nThey moved again, Bram texting with both hands while walking, Arif pacing him with an itch in the soles of his feet that would not be calmed by any rhythm but forward. Dara\u2019s men materialized out of shadows, as if her will grew staff. One was broad in the chest with a nose that had been broken and reset with evident care, the other narrow and fox-like around the eyes, each of them wearing the kind of shirt that looked like nothing until you tried to pull it off and realized it was expensive. They did not speak to Arif except with their attentive silence, which was fine with him; words sometimes made the ground crumble.\n\nThe vendor yard was not a place built for poetry. It was a rectangle of concrete and bad lighting, chain-link fence topped with coils that had known better days and dull knives at their edges. Metal racks held plastic chairs stacked to the height of a small house. Water pooled in the low places and reflected the light in mean little coins. There was a smell of stale oil and something sweeter underneath, like candy left in a car. From the far side of the yard came the chuckle of a small engine and the sound of someone swearing at something that would not fit into something else.\n\nThe gate had a padlock that wanted to look fierce. It sat in its hasp like a fat dog. Bram looked at it, looked at Dara\u2019s broad-shouldered man, and the man said, \u201cGive me thirty seconds,\u201d like a promise rather than a guess. He produced something from his back pocket that looked like a hairpin and something else that looked like a secret and the padlock opened with the kind of sigh people make when they realize they have been out-argued. They slipped in, let the gate kiss closed behind them, and divided without needing to agree first.\n\nArif moved along the edge where the fence met a line of tarps and cases, every sense opening like valves. He saw a piece of scarf snagged on a rough edge of shelf metal, gray, the weave familiar. He did not touch it immediately. He crouched and let his eyes widen and adjust, because he had learned on boats that sometimes the thing you think you see is only the reflection of a thing that isn\u2019t there. Then he reached and took the thread between his fingers, and the itch in his feet moved up, settled behind his eyes.\n\nBeyond the racks, a low building sat with its back turned to the yard. The door was dented near the bottom, where someone had kicked it often for reasons that had nothing to do with cruelty and everything to do with hurry. The air that breathed from the gap between door and frame was colder than the air outside. Bram arrived at Arif\u2019s shoulder and put his palm against the metal. He didn\u2019t push. He listened. There is a way metal talks to you when you know how to ask. He looked at Arif and nodded and then put his weight in the right angle and the door opened.\n\nInside it was fridges and the thin hum of machines who felt they were performing an important duty. A strip of light jittered at the ceiling from a fluorescent that was considering retirement. Boxes labeled with handwriting sat on the floor. Citrus bar, someone had scrawled, as if afraid they would forget what lemons were. The lettering made Arif\u2019s jaw twitch. He had seen that hand write orders to a delivery guy who always complained about the weight of ice and the cost of gas.\n\nHe went to his knees and ran his palm over the tops of the boxes as if he could feel who had carried them. He found one that had tape over tape, a patchwork like a field seen from the air. There was a line of ribbon taped to it, a blue strip with the contest logo quartered across it in white, cut in half by the tear. He touched the edge of it and the movement of his thumb across the raw fabric was the shape of his dream, and his stomach turned. The taste at the back of his throat was not lemon or fear but something bitter he couldn\u2019t name.\n\nBram took a box cutter from a shelf as if it had always meant to end up in his hand and slit the tape with the kind of care a surgeon gives to skin. He opened the box and found bottles nested like birds, each tucked in newspaper to keep it safe from its neighbors. The caps were plastic but sealed with care. He lifted one out and sniffed it, then offered it to Arif.\n\nArif did not drink in the way some men did, but he could taste a thing and know its weather. He wetted one finger, touched it to his tongue, and waited. Lemon. Sugar. Salt. Then something too sharp, a high note that did not belong to Lila\u2019s recipe, like laughter in a place where laughter had no business. He frowned and tried again in case the first taste was a lie. It wasn\u2019t. The bitterness was shy but definite, the taste of medicine and a field at noon.\n\n\u201cQuinine,\u201d Bram said, as if reading his mind, and shrugged. \u201cSome bars cheat the bitterness into their drinks. It makes their gins seem more ginful.\u201d\n\n\u201cLila doesn\u2019t cheat,\u201d Arif said, more sharply than any tonic should earn. \u201cIf she wants bitterness she uses peel. If she wants question marks she uses cloves.\u201d He held the bottle up to the jittering light and watched the syrup throw back an oily sheen. \u201cThis is not her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich means someone changed it,\u201d Bram said. \u201cOr someone asked her to make it this way and she rolled her eyes and did it because money makes new recipes.\u201d\n\nArif ran his thumb along the bottle cap until the plastic bit at his skin. \u201cOr someone took what she made and added something to it because their plan is not our plan.\u201d\n\nBram smiled with one side of his mouth in a way that suggested it wasn\u2019t a smile as much as acknowledgment of a shape in the fog. \u201cAnd what plan would that be?\u201d\n\nArif looked at the ribbon again because he couldn\u2019t not. \u201cTomorrow there will be a tent full of people with their mouths open,\u201d he said. \u201cAn after-party with glasses lifted. Cameras. A sponsor who wants a story. A club that wants to be more famous than it is. If you wanted to lace something through a city, you could do worse than a party where everyone asks for the same drink.\u201d\n\nBram was nodding when the sharp-faced man by the door lifted his hand, which meant silence and the presence of a thing that made noise even when it wanted to be quiet. Footsteps outside, two pairs, then three. A scrape that could have been a boot against concrete or a box being made to pretend it weighed less than it did. The men moved without speaking, and you could hear when silence had a different owner. The broad man slid toward the door with something heavy behind his back. Bram reached for the light and pulled it off, and the room shrank into the kind of dark that makes you think you have grown new ears.\n\nThe door opened a crack and the light from the yard entered like a person. Two shapes came in with it. One spoke in a whisper that wanted to be a shout. \u201cWhere are the A\u2019s?\u201d he said. \u201cHe told me A\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d the second shape said, and the whisper had a radio in it. \u201cHere. The tape. A. Put it on the boat. He wants it at Kota before two. Don\u2019t look.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at what?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt anything you will then describe to a police officer.\u201d\n\nArif felt his heart walk to the end of its leash and stop. He did not move. He breathed. He knew this dance. You made your body become rope, and rope did not exist until it needed to.\n\nThe man with the radio moved deeper. You could tell he was sure of his night and the fact that it belonged to him. He bent, his head coming under the stingy light slanting in from the door, and Arif saw, clearly as if someone had drawn it with a good pen, a feather behind his ear. Not a heron\u2019s plume, which would have been too long, but something short, stylized, like a hint rather than a biography. It was inked in dark blue. It looked like a laugh he would not understand.\n\nBram let his breath out through his teeth and stepped forward out of the dark as if he had decided the time for hiding and stealing things unseen had passed. He lifted his hands to the height of his shoulders, palms empty because sometimes emptiness was a more comforting thing to hand someone than a weapon. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said, in a voice that had the weight of many better rooms behind it. \u201cWrong shelf.\u201d\n\nThe man with the radio turned very slowly, as if he had learned long ago that the way you move when surprised can make a puppet of your fate. His eyes went wide and then flat. His hand dropped to something at his hip. Bram did not flinch. The broad man at the door did what broad men do and made his own shadow bigger than it was by standing exactly so. The fox-eyed man flowed left and became a suggestion near the fridges.\n\nArif was aware of how warm the bottle in his hand had become and how foolish it was to be holding a bottle when this was the kind of conversation that should be conducted by men holding a different vocabulary. He set the bottle down, because he had not yet made all the mistakes he was going to make tonight and it seemed courteous to leave some for the end.\n\n\u201cWe just need to borrow the owner of that phone,\u201d Bram said, nodding toward Lila\u2019s device on the shelf, which was a lie of geography and therefore an interesting new shape. \u201cYou take your boxes to your boat. We will take our person to our tent. Everyone goes to bed with their teeth inside their mouths.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not police,\u201d the radio voice said. He said it as a fact and as a contempt. \u201cWhich means you are prey that forgot its place.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrey tastes bad when it\u2019s angry,\u201d Dara said from the doorway, and Arif had never been so pleased in his life to hear a voice that was not his. She stood with her hands in the pockets of her dress like a woman leaning on a balcony looking down at poor choices. She had brought one more man, who had brought a gun but held it like a violin. \u201cThe reservation was mine,\u201d she added, not because it mattered but because it was fun to say the truth so hard it made strangers blink.\n\nThe feather-ear\u2019s mouth did a small thing and then stopped doing it. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the A cases,\u201d he said, because names were anchors and he was trying to steady his boat. \u201cThe rest is for the contest. The sponsor pays for after a party. You do not need to know more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always need to know more,\u201d Dara said dryly. \u201cIt\u2019s why I have fewer friends than enemies and better shoes than either.\u201d\n\nArif stepped forward then because the thing he needed to say would become poison if he held it any longer. \u201cWhere is Lila?\u201d He did not dress the word cousin around her name. His voice put that dress on her without trying. \u201cShe came with you. You do not leave women outside the door like shoes.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, the man looked at him. He looked and then looked at the ribbon, at Arif\u2019s hand, at the place behind Arif\u2019s ear where the thin crescent of scar lived under hair. He grinned briefly and without joy. \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cThe boy who eats pie like a machine. Ferry television. People in my kampung cheered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you liked the show, you should leave the actor his mouth,\u201d Dara murmured. She had a talent for sounding bored when she wanted to scare someone. \u201cYou have one minute to say the name of the place where you left the girl behind, or I will count how many bones your wrist has when it is working and again when it is not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he is the kind of man who answers questions because a woman with jewelry asks nicely?\u201d the other man scoffed, which turned out to be his mistake. The broad-shouldered man moved a fraction and the scoffer\u2019s shoulder found the door hard and in the wrong place. He made a noise like someone had taken an elegant idea out of his head and replaced it with a bird.\n\n\u201cMarina C,\u201d the feather-ear said, and he looked like a man who had not meant to say anything yet had found language in his mouth suddenly heavy. \u201cThe old fish freezer near the canal. We brought her to talk and she talked like a knife. We left her with the freezer to cool off. The boss will bring her to the club when the time is right. That is not your worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe time is not right?\u201d Bram said gently. \u201cShe will be cold and you will be fired.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not alone,\u201d the man said, too quickly now, improvising or sabotaging himself; Arif could not tell which and did not care. \u201cThere is a boy watching her. He eats candy like his mother hasn\u2019t taught him how to finish a meal. He has a feather on his neck. He\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more,\u201d Dara said, and the man closed his mouth as if it were a trap closing on the tail of a rat. She nodded once to her men, and they did something with their bodies that did not look like violence until you were paying attention. The men with the radio and the wrong brace of courage found themselves disarmed not of weapons but of their confidence. It was almost elegant.\n\nArif took one of the A-marked boxes and set it aside, a childish pettiness he did not intend until it was done. The tape bit his palm. He wanted to open every box in the room and pour them into the drain. He wanted to smash every bottle and taste each shard to see if his tongue could pick up lies as quickly as it picked up lemon. He wanted too many things. He took the ribbon instead, the little strip like a blue river cut off from its source, and put it in his pocket with Lila\u2019s phone, and then something in him settled enough to be useful.\n\n\u201cWe go now,\u201d he said, but he did not say it like a command; he said it like a boatman at the bow saying the tide had turned and if you did not lift anchor now your anchors would lift you. He looked at Bram, who was nodding, and he looked at Dara, who was already turning away, bored with men on the wrong shelf and interested in men who had built a freezer near a canal out of fish and cement and arithmetic.\n\nThe path from the yard to the service canal stank of old ambition. The water lay black and knowing under the low overpass, and a rat paused in the glow of an emergency light to consider them with a seriousness that made Arif want to bow. The freezer building sat like a shrug at the water\u2019s edge. Its windows were either bricked or ignored. A single light burned behind a frosted pane, and the light looked tired of itself. You could hear a generator purr like a cat that had learned to believe its own lies.\n\nDara\u2019s violin man took the lead. He did not posture with his weapon because only men who are playacting make that sort of theater. He put his back to the wall where the door would open inward and mouthed numbers that made his colleagues\u2019 shoulders shift at the correct syllables. Bram\u2019s voice brushed Arif\u2019s ear, lower than breath. \u201cIf you go first, it will be your last first,\u201d he said. \u201cStay on my shoulder. You will still get to be brave. You can be brave with your mouth, later.\u201d\n\nArif nodded because he trusted a man who kept his own bones inside his skin. He flexed his fingers once and thought of the way ropes bite when wet and what it means to give a thing a little slack so it does not bite itself harder. He thought of Lila\u2019s wrists with the temporary henna peeling at the edges, that sticky sugar under his fingers. He thought of the boy with candy, the feather like a comma on his neck, and made a quiet, vicious promise to every god he did not believe in that the boy would go home to be scolded about dental bills and not be a dot in a story he could not end.\n\nThe door opened as if it had been told to by someone it feared. The smell of cold came out\u2014dry and mean, a winter in a city that had none. Inside, the light made a crop of metal tables look like a field of ice. At the second table closest to the back wall, a figure curled in a chair, her feet bare and one ankle folded too long in a way that told Arif she had been trying to make a rope with her body and had only managed to tire her joints. Lila\u2019s head was bent to one side like she was listening to a secret in the wall. Her hands were bound with something red that looked almost pretty in bad light.\n\nA boy sat on a crate nearby, swinging one leg and reading something on his phone with a concentration that made Arif weirdly proud of youth. He had a paper-wrapped candy between his teeth. The feather ink on his neck was small and absurd and very new, the skin around it still irritated. He glanced up when the door breathed, began to stand, and then did not because Dara\u2019s man had placed a barrel of opinion where it would persuade him to keep his thighs on the crate and his mouth shut.\n\nBram reached Lila first because Arif felt the floor tilt and he could not find his feet for one hot heartbeat. The rope around her wrists had cut her skin a little. Bram made the knot understand that it no longer had a job. He touched Lila\u2019s cheek with one knuckle and she lifted her head as if someone had pulled a thread from the ceiling and attached it to her hairline. Her eyes were wide and then narrowed because that was her shape when the world came back and needed to be scolded.\n\n\u201cYou took your time,\u201d she said. Her voice was rough and made of sand, and it was the most beautiful noise Arif had heard since the first time his grandfather started an engine that had cost a month of prayers. \u201cI am freezing and my right leg is angry and I will never forgive whoever chose that boy as a guard because he pees and does not wash his hands.\u201d\n\nArif laughed in one breath and almost cried in the next because his body had too many rooms and not enough furniture for all the feelings to sit at once. He went to her and put his hands on her face and then snatched them back because he realized he was standing where men with opinions stood when they thought they owned women. He put them on the back of the chair instead, which felt like a compromise between honor and panic. \u201cYou left your phone like a breadcrumb,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a clever bird.\u201d\n\n\u201cI left my phone like a debt,\u201d she said, and then winced when blood returned to her fingers and made it known. \u201cDid you bring me a jacket? No? You are a bad bird.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like an apology,\u201d Dara inquired, and it was the closest she had come to gentleness all night. \u201cI only have one, and I am saving it for your cousin when he does something stupid tomorrow on television.\u201d\n\nLila\u2019s mouth tilted. \u201cI like you,\u201d she said, as if this was a thing she could give and take back like money. \u201cWho are you? No, don\u2019t tell me. Tell me later. Tell me when I am wrapped in something that feels like a dragon.\u201d\n\nBram cut the rope at her ankles and stood with her hand in the air until he was sure it was a hand and not a feathered wheel about to spin off its axis. The boy on the crate made a small sound like the beginning of a protest and then swallowed it when Dara turned her head and let him see the future he would not enjoy if he made the sound any bigger. He was younger than his tattoo and his arrogance. He was too young for the room he had been put in.\n\n\u201cWater,\u201d Arif said to no one and everyone, and the fox-eyed man produced a bottle that was probably meant for a different problem and which nevertheless solved this one. Lila drank and made a face at the taste and drank again. She looked up at the boy and stuck out her tongue. \u201cI told your boss I don\u2019t keep my recipes in bottles,\u201d she said conversationally. \u201cMen always think women\u2019s work lives inside jars. My recipes live in my head. It is bigger than his jar.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should have just brought what you promised,\u201d the boy said, and Arif heard the radio in his mouth and decided it sat there because someone else\u2019s speech had taken up residence and this boy didn\u2019t yet have enough words of his own to push it out. \u201cThen you could have gone home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did bring it,\u201d Lila said, and lifted her bound hands as if they were a platter. \u201cYou touched it. We all touched it. It was already dirty before you grabbed it. Tell your boss I washed my lemons with holy water and his plan will burn.\u201d\n\nThe boy blinked, which was the right kind of confusion to carry home to a boss who liked to think he had vacuumed all superstition out of his men with money. Bram had Lila standing now, gently. Her weight settled into one hip and she drew her shoulders up as if warming herself from the inside.\n\n\u201cArif,\u201d she said, and he tried not to be the kind of man who goes soft and childish when his name is said in that particular way by a person who has just been returned to him. \u201cHe asked for my syrup. A special blend. He wanted the bitter. He said people like premium tastes. He said\u2014\u201d she stopped, thinking, rewinding, like she was lifting lines from a net carefully so none of them cut her palms. \u201cHe said if it wins, everybody will want it. He did not think I noticed he changed my bottle for another. So I left my phone and my pride and went to follow the wrong bottle. Then a boy with a feather put me here and told me not to move. He has bad teeth. I told him to floss.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are too brave,\u201d Arif said, and she made a noise that was not a laugh so much as a small storm.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI am angry. It is different. Brave makes people monuments before the day is over. Angry gets to eat breakfast.\u201d\n\nDara made a pleased sound that signaled she had approved a menu. \u201cWe will take the A boxes,\u201d she said to Bram. \u201cWe will make sure the after-party drinks do not make our guests recite poems at the moon or see God. We will give the sponsor a lesson in what the word \u2018ownership\u2019 means. Then we will give the boy with the feather a toothbrush and a job with someone who will make sure he remembers to use it. Then we will crush the gentleman with the radio voice gently between two board meetings until he makes a neat noise. Everyone will learn something tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Bram said mildly, \u201cthere is a contest. Our champion has to earn his photograph again.\u201d\n\nArif felt all the air in the room turn toward that sentence like grass leaning toward wind. His body, like an engine he had let idle too long, coughed and caught. The ribbon in his pocket scratched his skin where it lay, and the small remembered feel of a ribbon\u2019s edge bookended the sharp newness of rope on wrists and a knot pulled loose. He looked at Lila and said the thing he had not, until this second, been able to afford to say in his own head: \u201cI want to win for the same reason I want to hurt them,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cTo take back a piece of my mouth.\u201d\n\nLila tilted her chin. Her eyes were still those narrow slits of a person who did not give the night the dignity of being impressed by it. \u201cThen eat their money,\u201d she said. \u201cEat it in front of everybody. Make them clap for you because they have forgotten what else they came for. Make them pay for forgetting.\u201d\n\nThe boy with the candy watched them like he was looking at a species of adults who do not live in his neighborhood. He opened his mouth. \u201cCan I\u2026 go?\u201d he asked to no one and everyone, and Dara considered him like a puzzle she might not be bored by.\n\n\u201cYou can go home,\u201d she said finally. \u201cYou can tell your mother that you tried to watch a woman and she watched you back and you failed. Then you can decide who you want to be next.\u201d She nodded at the door. \u201cRun. Do not join a bigger fish unless you learn how to be a river first.\u201d\n\nHe ran, because boys run even when told to walk. He slammed his shoulder into the frame and did not say sorry and did not look back because he had correctly calculated that looking back would make his future worse in the short term. Bram exhaled once and gathered up a box like he had been born lifting weight with calculation. The broad-shouldered man took two. The fox-eyed man did a thing with tape that made it look like it had never been touched.\n\nThey left the freezer as if it had decided it did not want them in it anyway. The canal breathed damp and the city farther back was a low shout. Arif helped Lila into the golf cart that had appeared like a magic trick with the Mariana script on it, and for a second the absurdity of the letters made him want to kiss someone for how stupid the world was sometimes and how it nevertheless manufactured grace.\n\nAs they bumped along by the water, Lila leaned against him for the first time since they were children and the ferry had jumped a wake and he had reached, unthinking, and made a net with his arms. He felt her ribs and he felt, beneath the ribs, anger cooling to something useful. \u201cYou look like you slept on a deck,\u201d she murmured, finding a smile in her mouth despite all its injuries. \u201cYou smell like red bean and trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey gave your phone a table at Blue Heron,\u201d he said. \u201cYour fame grows.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy phone is more interesting than me,\u201d she said, and for the first time all night her laughter came untangled from the fear that had been living in its threads. \u201cTomorrow, the boy eats pies. Tonight, we go home and I put my feet in a bowl of hot water and swear at the ceiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd after that?\u201d he asked, because he could not help himself, because this was his fault and not his fault, because he had a talent for making letters into charms.\n\n\u201cAfter that,\u201d she said, \u201cyou find the edge of your ribbon and pull. We see what comes loose. And we make lemonade for three thousand people because Satria promised and I will make him pay for that promise with his pride.\u201d\n\nThey were near the tent again, the lights making a field that made strangers into friends for the price of an hour. Dara slid off the cart as if it had been beneath her to sit at all and adjusted her dress like a flag. She looked at Arif and then at Lila. \u201cI do not like saints,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I like you. Try not to make me regret it by doing something noble and stupid tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow I will do something hungry and efficient,\u201d Arif said. \u201cNoble and stupid I am saving for next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cBring me a slice of whoever you beat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t slice people,\u201d Lila said, affronted on behalf of the concept. \u201cWe slice pies.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame language,\u201d Dara countered, and then she was gone into the light with men drifting behind her like punctuation marks, the night rearranging itself around the absence of her voice.\n\nBram touched Arif\u2019s arm, and Arif did not pull away because some men\u2019s touch did not move you closer to a cliff. \u201cThree hours of sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we will meet the baker with the laugh who thinks her husband is dough. You will put your mouth to work on something that will not bite back.\u201d\n\n\u201cBu Dewi,\u201d Arif said, and let the name sit on his tongue like sugar. \u201cDurian tart that smells like socks only in memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Bram said. \u201cAlways start the day with an enemy you can eat.\u201d\n\nThey split at the vendor gate, the men with the boxes going in a direction that would make other men think twice before following, Lila leaning more of her weight into Arif because she had decided he deserved the load by now. The Laut Liris slept at the quay, listening with her tilted mast. The city blinked at them with her hundred eyes and kept her council. Arif felt the ribbon in his pocket and smelled lemon in the creases of Lila\u2019s hair and made a promise to the night, to the water, to the old scar behind his ear, to the piece of himself he could almost remember being attached to a garland made of pastry leaves. He promised to pull until something broke and he kept that promise as both a bowline and a prayer.Morning came with a bruised yellow light that made the hull ribs glow like old bones, and Arif woke at the exact moment the Liris shifted under him as if she had been waiting to be polite. His tongue carried the ghost of red bean and cold, which would have been pleasant if his jaw didn\u2019t feel like it had been asked to clench for an hour while keeping an oath. He lay for a breath and counted the noises that meant the world had survived the night\u2014the mutter of harbor voices, the rope tender\u2019s cough, the clatter of a bucket on someone\u2019s deck because it had slipped and then been lied about. When he swung his feet down, the floor was cool enough to make his ankle bones complain, and the letter in his pocket found the shape of his thigh without him telling it how. He touched the crease where it was nearly torn and let his breath out through his teeth because there was a day to be had and pretending it wasn\u2019t coming was a luxury people with fewer debts could afford.\n\nLila had curled herself into the corner bench in the Liris\u2019s tiny galley, a blanket over her shoulders and her hair loose in a way that made her look younger and more dangerous. The rope burns looked like bracelets a child had drawn around her wrists with a broken crayon. She had put a pot of water to heat and fallen asleep with a spoon in her hand as if she had been caught mid-negotiation. Arif stood and watched her for a minute the way a man stands over any treasure you could lose stupidly. He took the spoon gently and set it on the table, and when the water had reached the polite sound of first bubbles, he poured it into a bowl and added salt until it looked like a little sea. He slid the bowl under the table to sit, made tea with whatever leaves had been left in the bottom of the tin, and waited for Lila to wake so he could be smug about having guessed the exact moment her foot would want heat and salt.\n\n\u201cYou hover like an aunt,\u201d she said without opening her eyes, which was either evidence of true cousinhood or witchcraft. She pushed the blanket down with her shoulder and the night let go of her in stages, like some old polite animal not ready to leave. \u201cDo not tell me we are late. I will cut time into pieces if it tries that trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are on time for nothing,\u201d he said, which made her smile because it was true. He put her foot into the bowl and watched her make the face she made when pleasure surprised her and she resented it. He wanted to say the thing he had chosen to save for light about fear being a stupid dog that ate anything you left on the table, even if it was a phone under a tarp. He wanted to say the thing about not leaving her alone again even if she told him to go play at being a hero and leave management to adults. He said neither, because promises made in kitchens have to be the kind you can keep without a rhythm section behind them.\n\nPak Kacek appeared on deck like a bad fortune rendered lovingly. He looked in at them through the hatch and shook his head like a rooster who had decided the morning had been arranged improperly. \u201cYour face says you fought ghosts,\u201d he announced, which in his mouth came out as approval. \u201cI brought breakfast. My wife made soto because she thinks soup solves reputations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wife is correct,\u201d Lila said, lifting her foot and tapping it dry on the blanket as if she could insult physics into behaving better. \u201cGive it here. I will swallow it without argument.\u201d\n\nThey sat with the bowls on the table and ate like people who knew what hunger for anything does when you feed it with the wrong thing. The broth had the exact right trick of heat, and Arif felt it go somewhere useful. Pak Kacek watched them both over his spoon, taking in the sugar-burns, the bruised places, the letter in Arif\u2019s pocket that had worn a map into his clothes. \u201cWe will fix the pump at ten,\u201d he declared, because men like him admired schedules almost as much as they ignored them. \u201cBefore that we visit the woman who thinks she married yeast. She called at dawn to say her laugh woke two pigeons and a baker and she blamed you for both.\u201d\n\n\u201cBu Dewi,\u201d Lila said, and licked her spoon with violent neatness. \u201cWe said we would go. I\u2019m not cancelling on the only person who thinks a durian should be taught manners.\u201d\n\nThey were out into the quay air an hour later, which meant nearly two, because Lila had insisted on changing her scarf three times and Arif had realized he had slept in a shirt that had acquired a fish scale pattern by accident. The city had put on its daytime costume, traffic like a migration done wrong, men and women drawing their days behind them like nets catching half-useful things. A man on the pier had chalked a neat blue feather near the bollards and Arif saw it and let his eyes pass over it as if it were not anything. Later, he told himself, because anger you pick up too early in a day drops under your feet when you least need it.\n\nBu Dewi\u2019s bakery lived behind a shutter painted with strawberries that had never seen strawberries and under a sign that said \u201cTart & Manis\u201d in a font that had been excited twenty years ago and had tired since. It had a smell that settled over your head like a hat you would not be embarrassed to be photographed in. She had a flour handprint on her apron in the shape of a country and even more flour in her laugh. She pulled them inside like a tide and made a show of looking at Lila\u2019s wrists and clucking like a hen who knew the value of scolding someone you were going to feed.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t die,\u201d she announced. \u201cVery good. I am a selfish woman. If you die, I have nobody to gossip with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not gossip,\u201d Lila said with indignation that came out as affection. \u201cI am news.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter,\u201d Bu Dewi said. \u201cNews you can eat.\u201d She ran the back of her hand along Arif\u2019s jaw the way aunties test the quality of fruit. \u201cYou look like a boy who wrestled a rumor and lost. Sit. I made the durian do as it was told.\u201d\n\nThe tart was a miracle of two kinds of obedience. The crust held when it should and submitted when that was wiser. The filling announced itself like a traveler with good stories and one too many shirts in his bag, and yet somehow did not knock any chairs over. Arif took a bite and the exact arrangement of sweetness and something almost rotten but not quite made his nose itch the way strong memory does. For a second the bakery was a white tent and the air was full of breath and ribbon string, and he heard his own laugh from last year, the one Lila had described to him and he had not believed because he did not think he owned that sound. He took another bite and felt the shape of the bite fit into a groove as if his mouth had been saving it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re there,\u201d Bu Dewi said, as if he had let out a small light from behind his teeth and she had seen it. \u201cYou went somewhere and came back with a better face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember a corner,\u201d he said, and did not hide his surprise because hiding is for later. \u201cNot everything. But a corner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe corners are where the spiders live,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cThey make the web strong. It is enough, for now.\u201d She set another tart down, this one apple with thin slices arranged like gills. \u201cIf you want your mouth to do its old tricks, you must ask your hands to make the right shapes. Practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not practice eating like a pig,\u201d Lila sniffed, already reaching for a knife. \u201cI practice breathing while watching men eat like pigs, which is more noble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour nobility can sit,\u201d Bu Dewi said, swatting at the air. \u201cThe boy needs water. The boy needs rhythm. I will show you the water. He knows the rhythm already. Even when men forget, their bodies keep at least one song.\u201d\n\nShe had never competed, she said, because showing your mouth to a crowd was for people with more stubborn vanity than she could afford. But she had watched three years of contestants and learned what they knew whether or not they wanted to know it. She had arranged pitchers at three temperatures, one with ice swimming like penguins, one at room-warm, and one as hot as a confession. \u201cMen think cold keeps the throat alive,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is correct until the cold makes the throat a stone. Then the stone sits and tells you secrets you don\u2019t have time to write down. Try warm. Try hot. See which lies less.\u201d\n\nArif dunked crust into warm and felt it surrender without turning to paste. Hot lit his chest like shame and made his tongue a stranger. Cold was a promise his hands couldn\u2019t keep for long. He found himself moving in a cadence that was half-work song, half prayer, and realized somewhere under his sternum something had clicked in and said yes, you have done this, badly and then better, and then well enough to put a blue ribbon on your throat and call it a garland. Lila counted under her breath, not numbers but names\u2014\u201cAyam, ikan, ular,\u201d as if counting animals was less likely to break anything important in the air.\n\nBy the third tart he had discovered where to place his breath so it did not insult his swallow. By the fifth he knew the exact point when strawberry glaze becomes an enemy and where to put his eyes so they did not dive into the crowd and drown. He did not remember himself laughing with sugar on his chin last year, but he remembered now how not to hate the feeling of hands clapping because they did not know what else to do when faced with hunger organized into a show. He let himself be grateful for that thin trick of knowing, and when he caught Lila\u2019s gaze sliding over his face with that same carefulness she used to test a syrup, he lifted his chin a fraction to tell her he had found the beat.\n\n\u201cDo not forget to stop before stopping stops you,\u201d Bu Dewi said, and folded his sticky fingers into his palm for him like he was a boy with sugar and a pocket and poor ideas. \u201cPeople think winning is like a ride at the fair. They do not see the part where it takes your legs away when nobody is looking.\u201d\n\nHe sat on the little stool she gave him and let the sugar tremor pass through. Lila poured him tea because she was the only person allowed to pour anything into him without him being allowed to argue. He looked at the scratch on her wrist and watched her flex the hand as if she was telling the skin it owed her a better performance tomorrow. \u201cHe wanted my bitter,\u201d she said to the steam because the steam did not react. \u201cThe boy with a radio burns for a boss who walks around with a mirror in his pocket and calls it God. They wanted me to help them. They do not know you cannot make a woman like me helpful without paying in a currency I like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like stories,\u201d Bu Dewi said. \u201cYou will take theirs and spend it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will turn it into a recipe I do not share,\u201d Lila agreed, and blew on her tea with a ferocity that made the steam choose to leave faster.\n\nThe front shutter rattled and a head popped under it, trailing a camera and a smell of perfume that had ambitions. A girl with too much energy and too little shame stuck her face into the bakery and said Arif\u2019s name like it was a gossip column. Behind her, a boy with a shoulder rig filmed the strawberries and the sugar and the morning indignation. \u201cChampion,\u201d she sang. \u201cIs it true? Were you kidnapped? Are you saving Jakarta with your mouth? Our subscribers love a narrative with civic responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe love privacy with knives,\u201d Lila said flatly, which translated into any language as Not Today. The girl made a regretful face that meant she had learned to make regret look like a service. She pointed her microphone at Arif\u2019s mouth anyway, because a mouth is a mouth whether it is chewing or speaking. \u201cWe can do footage of you training,\u201d she suggested. \u201cInspirational. Sweat. Men love seeing men sweat. Women too.\u201d\n\nArif looked at Bu Dewi, who gave the smallest possible shake of her head, and he decided he had earned the right to receive advice. He smiled at the camera boy the way you smile at someone who is doing a job their mother will never understand. \u201cToday I am training to drink tea without spilling it,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow you can film my sweat and sell it for money. Today is my grandmother\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe girl laughed too loud, because that is how you laugh when you have to sell laughter to an audience that can click away. She was about to push again when a shadow in the doorway made her change her math. Satria leaned against the shutter with an expression that said he had swallowed his pride and it had given him indigestion. He looked at the camera and then at Lila\u2019s face and made the correct decision for once in a day to lower his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re securing the sponsor lounge,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cAnd the after-party. There will be no \u2018A\u2019 boxes anywhere anyone\u2019s mother can see. I am not a person who enjoys being told I have failed. Please stop being a person who gives me new failures.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did your work for you,\u201d Lila said, and tilted her head so the light caught the ugly neatness of the rope burns. \u201cSend an invoice to your conscience.\u201d\n\nSatria\u2019s shoulders slumped in a way that made him look shorter and younger. \u201cI know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cGerry is weeping into his jacket because Dara shouted at him until his hair lost its product. I have to stand between men who think the word \u2018activation\u2019 can fix everything and a woman who can have me barred from every club north of the old city. If you want to ruin her morning, you will have to get in line behind me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell Gerry he cannot put a heron on a boy\u2019s sleeve and expect to remain untangled when the boy decides he is a river,\u201d Bu Dewi said, because she liked to scold men she had not fed. \u201cAlso tell him I will bring egg tarts to his party if and only if his people show me their ears before they come in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell him all of that,\u201d Satria said with an expression that suggested he would cut half and add a joke to soften what remained. He looked at Arif then, not quite meeting his eyes. \u201cThe schedule is locked. Press conference at noon tomorrow. Finale at dusk the day after. Rehearsal this afternoon for the people who insist on practicing walking onto a stage. If you don\u2019t come, Gerry will send a dragon to fetch you. He has one. She wears tamarind.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell Dara that if she arrives wearing scales I will fetch my net,\u201d Arif said, and Lila made a sound that might have been a cough and might have been a laugh trying to disguise itself so it wouldn\u2019t be asked to perform.\n\nAfter the shutter had rattled back down over the girl with the camera and the boy with the shoulder rig and Satria\u2019s headache, after the tarts had stopped announcing their availability, after Bu Dewi had set them to work wrapping pastry leaves in ribbon for reasons that made no sense until she explained a sponsor had paid to have garlands that would fall apart in an aesthetically pleasing manner, Arif stepped into the alley and breathed the particular stink of drains that had been loved and then abandoned. He took the letter out and unfolded it again with the care of a man who suspects his talisman might turn into paper right when he needs it to be a knife. The logo looked different in street light, less jaunty, more tired. He thought of the tiny memory he had plucked from last night like a coin from the harbor bottom\u2014cheering and ribbon edge\u2014and he tried to place it on the paper like a stamp. It didn\u2019t stick. It was not that he remembered more; it was that he was less afraid of not remembering.\n\nA woman with a scarf and a tray balanced on one hand passed, selling plastic bags of palm sugar and gingers. She paused and watched him like you watch a man who has met a river he cannot name. \u201cYou are the boy,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom the board. With the laugh. Last year my niece screamed at the television because she thought you would die.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI only dropped a thing I was told not to drop.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cBetter to drop a thing than a mouth.\u201d She shifted the tray and it flashed with small lights because sugar does that when it is fresh. \u201cYou will win again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to,\u201d he said, because honesty in alleys costs less than honesty under tents, and the woman nodded like he had paid correct change.\n\nOn the walk back to the quay, they passed the chalk feather again and this time Lila crouched and smudged it with her thumb until it was a blue bruise on the concrete. She stood up like she had erased a thing that did not deserve to be a picture. \u201cLet them draw birds,\u201d she said. \u201cWe draw boats.\u201d She tapped the letter in his pocket like a bell. \u201cWe draw our names on the water and make them float.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, rehearsal was a caravan of people who liked to be important about minor things. A boy with a headset told Arif how to walk three steps and then stop, how to lift his chin as if he had been expecting applause since birth. He showed him where the stage would pretend to be a dock and where the cameras liked faces. Lila stood in the wings with a clipboard she had stolen from a girl who did not look old enough to drive and pretended to be unimpressed, which had the immediate and satisfying effect of making five different men try to impress her at once. Arif walked the three steps and stopped and lifted his chin and felt like a puppet whose string had been jerked by a child with sticky fingers. He did it again and made it his. He did it a third time and let himself look up beyond the lights to where the tent met sky, because he had promised himself not to act like a trapped animal even if some men thought that would sell more tickets.\n\nGerry surfed in and out of the rehearsal with a phone to his ear and a look that said he had decided stress was a brand and he wore it well. When he saw Lila, he went toward her like the letter H drawn by a drunk. He took her wrist in a friendly assault and made a pained sound at the rope burns, which meant he had realized there was a story there he could not tell because Dara would murder him publicly with etiquette. He offered her a jacket from a garment bag that had a bird embroidered on it so large it could have flown away if the stitches had less pride. She took it, because it was rude to refuse a gift in public, and folded it until the bird bent its head as if reconsidering its life choices.\n\nThe second-place woman from last year, the stout one with the headscarf and the kind face full of a steel that does not show itself until you bite it, found him backstage and stood beside him as if they had been arranged that way by someone who understood where to place a pillar when your roof was in doubt. \u201cI thought you had become a movie person,\u201d she said, as if confessing to a mistake about the weather. \u201cThey said you would not come back because people who win once prefer to be saints and statues. Good. I like beating men who are not statues.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou went home last year with a prize and a sugar coma,\u201d he said, and her laugh was the most human sound he\u2019d heard in an hour of camera rehearsal.\n\n\u201cI went home with money,\u201d she said. \u201cI bought my daughter a bicycle and forgave my neighbor for the way he speaks about my lawn. You dropped your trophy and I picked it up because I am a better mother than you are.\u201d She clapped him on the back hard enough to burp a baby. \u201cYour face looks like it has seen something that makes pie sound small. Don\u2019t bring big things to the table. You scare the crust.\u201d\n\nHe swallowed a line of gratitude because he wanted to put it somewhere private. He asked her if she remembered a ribbon across his thumb last year and she nodded slowly like a tree nods. \u201cYou broke it without meaning to,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made the crowd louder. It made you laugh. It made the organizer cry because he had paid for that ribbon and now it was nothing. Do you know how good it is to make a man cry because something is nothing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am learning,\u201d he said, and when she hugged him, he let himself be the boy in the photo for a second and nothing else.\n\nWhen the rehearsal broke into parts and fell apart entirely, when the lights went to sleep and the cables sighed, when Satria had been chased by three different clipboard girls about three different clipboards and looked like he would hide in a tent pole if he thought tent poles took pity on men, Arif and Lila walked away from the white scallops and toward the water because it was their habit and because habits you keep at the edge of something wide help your feet remember their job. The ferris wheel lit up and went dark again, a pulse that made people think they were seeing the city breathe. Men rolled cases toward vans. A child tried on his mother\u2019s shoes and clattered like a goat on a tin roof and made two aunties laugh until their eyes leaked.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Lila said, and her voice made that word into the correct size. \u201cPress and pie-tasting with old ladies who think the world is improved by telling boys what to do. After that, a night where we lock my stall and go home at nine like retirees. Then the day. Do you want me on stage with you or in the back making shapes with my face at you until you remember to swallow?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the back,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are on the stage I will look at your mouth when I should be looking at pies. If you are in the back I will look where your face will be and use that as a lighthouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cI like lighthouses. I like telling men when to stop. I am good at both.\u201d She kicked a cigarette butt that had been smug near the curb and sent it into a puddle. \u201cAlso, Dara sent a message that made my phone feel rich. She says she is borrowing the A boxes to teach a lesson at a meeting that uses long tables. She is going to build a drink that tastes like money without crime in it. She asked for my bitter. I told her she could have my peel but not my rind.\u201d\n\n\u201cDara with your peel,\u201d he said, picturing it and trying not to smile too obviously at the idea of that dry woman holding a wet lemon. \u201cBram will tell her where to pour it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBram will tell her where to stand so she does not get it on her shoes,\u201d Lila said. \u201cHe looks like a man who knows where messes begin even when the floor is still clean.\u201d\n\nOn the bus home, an old woman climbed aboard with a bucket of small fish and a child with hair braided so tight it could deflect arrows. The smell of the fish knocked the perfume of the city off its perch and made honesty of everything. Lila leaned her head on Arif\u2019s shoulder and when the bus turned, she stayed there. \u201cYou were right last night,\u201d she said into his shirt. \u201cAbout masks. I like Dara because she knows when to wear one and when to make it lift at the corner to show a tooth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like Bram because he is the kind of man who will pick up a knife when it is needed and then put it down where it belongs,\u201d Arif said, and watched the city blink slowly at them the way you watch a friend fall asleep mid-story.\n\nAt the Liris, the harbor night had already begun to erect its horizon of noise and light and rumor. Pak Kacek sat on the stern with a piece of rope and a stubborn knot because he could never sit without making a stand. He watched them approach and nodded at their lives as if he approved of their confusion. \u201cYou will win,\u201d he announced to the rope, which meant he was telling it a story about them. \u201cBecause it will be simpler if you do. The world is short on simple this week.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is simple,\u201d Arif said, and the older man grinned with all the satisfaction of a teacher telling a student they had finally answered correctly and would now be punished with more questions.\n\nHe lay that night with the ribbon under his thumb because he had decided a talisman could be made of anything if you handled it with a particular kind of faith. He listened to the tiny changes in the Liris\u2019s breath and picked out the minute he knew the tide shifted, and he promised himself he would sleep the hours he was owed because if he could not gather himself now he would not be able to hold anything tomorrow. In the quiet that wasn\u2019t quite quiet, he saw the photograph again, the eyes from the board bright as if someone had turned on a light from behind, and he saw a garland of pastry leaves, and he saw a man in a jacket cut like patience signal with two fingers as if inviting a soft instrument to play wrong. He did not see the face he had lost. He decided that was fine. Some men go to war with less and make worse decisions. He would go to a tent. He would go to a table. He would put his mouth where it belonged and take back what names he could.\n\nMorning made him honest about the bruise-blue feather on the quay because someone had chalked another near the warung gate, this time with a neatness that suggested pride. Lila lifted an eyebrow at it and then at him and he shrugged, because if he scowled at every bird he would spend his day hurting his own forehead. He bought two packets of boiled peanuts from a man whose hands had picked fish for twenty years and stressed about nothing else, and they ate standing up in line with other people waiting to be told where to go by small men with whistles and clipboards. The press secretary handed Arif a laminated pass with his name spelled too carefully and a packet of words he was supposed to say when someone gave him a microphone. He put the words in his back pocket and did not intend to use them.\n\nThe press conference was a circus that had tired of itself and wanted to go home. Gerry said three things at once and none of them refused to be true. He thanked Blue Heron; he praised Pie Nusantara; he put his hand on Arif\u2019s shoulder and used the word \u201cjourney\u201d twice, as if that could cover the distance between a freezer, a canal, and a stage. Dara sat in a chair too far from the microphone to be accused of stealing it and smiled with her eyebrows, which only people who are good at crime can do. Bram lurked in the peripherals as if he had been assigned the job of making sure no feathers entered the building without permission.\n\nA man in the back with a notebook the size of a plank and a chin like he could cut bread with it asked Arif about amnesia and triumph and redemption in the same breath and looked expectant. Arif took the microphone and felt the weight of it and decided to be bored by it instead of afraid. \u201cLast year I ate pies with joy,\u201d he said. \u201cThen a storm ate a piece of my head. This year I will eat pies with the same mouth and a better rope on my heart. If you need a story beyond that, I will introduce you to my cousin. She keeps them in jars, labeled.\u201d\n\nLila\u2019s laughter cut through the room like a clean instrument and even the men who were being paid to scowl were caught unprepared and smiled at it. Gerry tried to laugh like a bird. Dara didn\u2019t bother pretending. She watched him and when their eyes met she lifted an invisible glass and drank to a joke neither of them had told yet.\n\nAfterward, under the tent flap, a man with ink like seaweed at the side of his neck and a hopeful handshake introduced himself as Jonas, which felt like walking into a room that already knew your name. He wore a jacket that did not belong to him and a cologne that did. His hand was dry and his eyes were the same. \u201cWe have some overlap,\u201d he said to Arif in the tone of a man who suspects you have already decided how you feel about him and hopes to undo it with charm. \u201cTawa Promotions borrowed our boys for the opening. Blue Heron borrowed my mouth for a week. You know how it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer to borrow boats,\u201d Arif said mildly, and watched the man\u2019s mouth do a small arithmetic and come up at a number he didn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cI like your story,\u201d Jonas said, because when charm fails, some men try flattery and pray. \u201cEveryone likes a comeback.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone likes a man who doesn\u2019t get women tied up in freezers,\u201d Lila said into the space, and when Jonas flinched a fraction, as if someone had pointed a bright light at the wrong end of his day, Dara appeared like a punctuation mark that ends conversations and laid a hand like the idea of wealth on his elbow.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the wrong tent,\u201d she told him, and for a second he tried the trick of pretending not to understand her, and then he didn\u2019t, because people who wanted to continue eating at the right tables learned fast. He left the tent as if he had lost something and needed to find it without looking down.\n\n\u201cWill he try again?\u201d Arif asked Dara, and she made a face that said of course he would and of course he wouldn\u2019t, because men often made two decisions at once and then asked the night to choose.\n\n\u201cHe will try to be braver with different parts of his body,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will teach him to use those parts for walking. In the meantime, Bram has already replaced the A boxes with A-minus boxes and written a love letter to the man who thinks he made a new recipe last night. That man will read the letter tonight in the bathroom of his club and not sleep. Which is my favorite kind of justice.\u201d\n\nThey stepped back into the heat and the sugar and the shape of a day the city had decided to bake in a pan a little too small for it. Lila looped her arm through Arif\u2019s and steered him toward the vendors\u2019 alley because she could not help herself; a warung is a compass and she held it in her hands like a ship. \u201cWe work until sundown,\u201d she instructed. \u201cWe sleep like fishermen. We wake when the harbor clears its throat and pretends to be young. You stretch your mouth and your stubborn. I will make syrups and hide my pride where nobody can break it.\u201d\n\nHe made the face he made when he wanted to argue and set it aside the way you set aside a tool you love because the job requires a different one. He followed her, because boats follow the line through chop, because there is a way into everything if you stand at the edge long enough and let your eye soften until the shape appears. He listened to the city crash and purr. He felt the ribbon in his pocket and let his thumb worry it until the edge warmed under his skin. He tasted, in the back of his mouth where some truths stick, cinnamon and citrus and a small, stubborn promise that tomorrow his hands and his jaw would remember long enough for the rest of him to catch up.The afternoon folded itself into the kind of heat that made even the gulls look like they were conserving adjectives, and the tent people drifted away like a tide that had somewhere better to be. Lila installed herself in the back of her stall like a queen in a corrugated palace and set three pots to simmer at once, each with a different argument of peel and spice. The air filled up with lemon and ginger and the rounder, cuddlier warmth of palm sugar coaxed without mercy, and Arif stood at the edge of the counter with a knife and a bowl and the clear instruction not to bleed into anything they intended to sell. He found a rhythm in zesting because the skin yielded with the same whispering confidence as rope giving under a correct pull, and when he paused to shake the stripings into a tin, he caught himself smiling at the way the smell sat inside his head where worry had been renting a room. Lila counted under her breath while she stirred, not numbers this time but the days of the week backwards, because she said it kept all the other discipline in line, and when a boy tried to steal a fritter off the corner without paying she flicked a wet spoon at him and he laughed with good manners and paid anyway.\n\nPak Kacek came by pretending to look for a loose washer that had never existed and actually to check whether their faces had begun to look like faces who would survive the next twenty-four hours. He told a story about a Dutchman who mistook tamarind for a charm and wore it around his neck during monsoon and never caught a cold again but also never kept a friend, and then he leaned his elbows on the counter in a way that would have got him a scolding if any of the aunties who truly owned the alley had seen him. He watched Arif\u2019s hands on the knife and nodded once like he was acknowledging a rhythm that had finally remembered itself. When a scooter coughed too close and sprayed a mist of city in their direction, he put his body in front of Lila\u2019s pots like a door shaped like a person, and Lila pretended not to notice because noticing would have made the moment sentimental and then they would have had to make jokes to pay for it.\n\nBy the time the sun had climbed over the warung roofs and then thought better of the effort, Dara sent a message that was not a request and not quite a command, and it brought with it the picture in Arif\u2019s head of the Blue Heron\u2019s interior like a second geography. \u201cMeeting,\u201d it said. \u201cBring your bitter. Leave your pity.\u201d Lila made a face at the phone that would have made a less durable device crack and then decanted one of her syrups into a bottle that used to hold imported olives because repurposing felt like a particular kind of revenge. They rinsed their hands until they smelled like public water and soap instead of sugar and climbed into a taxi because the bus at that hour was a test of patience and they had already passed one exam today.\n\nInside the club there were fewer people and more light, and the light had been arranged by someone who liked to make money appear cleaner than it was. Dara sat at the end of a long table that looked like it had been made from a single piece of wood cut from a tree that had been asked for an apology and had not given one, and beside her was a small collection of men who had learned to dress expensively in ways that were supposed to make you forget which kampung had given them the first loan. Gerry paced the far side like a dog who had learned a trick and wanted someone to throw him a ball, and Jonas sat two chairs down with his hand around a glass and an expression like a man practicing contrition in a mirror. Bram stood by the window looking at the harbor as if it had whispered something rude and he was considering whether to laugh.\n\nDara placed one of the A-marked bottles on the table with a neatness that suggested a ceremony, and then she placed Lila\u2019s bottle beside it like a judge putting down two versions of the truth. She did not speak immediately, and the silence made the men\u2019s watches suddenly very loud. When she did finally use her mouth, she did it very gently, which made every sentence sound like an insult you would thank her for. She explained, crisp as paper edges, how private rooms have codes and codes leave footprints, how sponsors who desire discretion often confuse it with impunity, and how bitter is not an ingredient you purchase from a man with a radio and a logo; it is an agreement between tongue and throat and memory. She unscrewed the A bottle first and handed it to Gerry without looking at his face, then to Jonas, and then to a man with a square ring who had been pretending to be a piece of furniture. They sipped and made the faces men make when they do not want to admit they taste a mistake.\n\nLila said nothing until the very end of the tasting circle. She tipped a capful of her own syrup against her wrist and inhaled and then did the same with the A bottle, and something in her shoulders changed like a sail that had found its true wind. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to make expensive taste like medicine,\u201d she said quietly, directing the sentence not to Gerry because he would have made it into a lifestyle, but to Jonas because his eyes had flinched when he tasted the wrong bitter. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to teach a crowd to believe that a punishment is sophistication. That trick works until the second glass and then it ends with someone crying into a cab and telling the story wrong to a friend who will put it on the internet.\u201d\n\nJonas tried to smile with complicity and found he had no spare muscles for it. Gerry glanced at Dara and performed a sigh as if he had been expecting to be disappointed all his life and was relieved to finally have the chance. Dara cut a small slice of the air with two fingers and everyone\u2019s gaze followed it like a flock. \u201cWe will not serve your tonic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will serve something that makes people want to spend money because they are happy and not because they have been tricked into mistaking numbness for taste. If you insist on putting your logo on a bottle of quinine with delusions, you may do so in your own room for your own friends. If you insist on bringing boys with feathers behind their ears into my gardens, I will put seeds in their pockets they do not want.\u201d\n\nThe man with the ring began to protest in the language of legal men and long tables and contracts that believe they have souls, and Bram leaned off the window and into the room just enough to change the gravity. He did not threaten; he enumerated. He listed how many cameras had seen which cart and where the ribbon had been torn. He sketched, without naming, the video of Jonas with his hand on a handle that had been meant for chairs and not for people. He mentioned the boy with the candy and the freezer with the tired light. He asked whether anyone in the room wished to sublicense the kinds of stories that come blowing in off canals when the wind changes. By the time he finished, the man with the ring was polishing the square as if it had begun to feel tight.\n\nWhat made the meeting end was not Dara\u2019s ice or Bram\u2019s arithmetic, though either would have done; it was Lila sliding her bottle toward the center with two fingers and saying, without any drama, \u201cUse this or don\u2019t. But don\u2019t use me without paying me and thinking I won\u2019t notice.\u201d The sentence hung in the air like a banner at a parade, and even the air condicioning decided to hum less loudly for a moment. Gerry\u2019s smile tried on an expression that looked like sincerity and kept it because it fit better than he expected, and he nodded, and the kind of paperwork that births better nights began to unroll in the minds of men who had come ready to roll something else.\n\nOn the way out, Jonas drifted near with the intention of practicing contrition aloud, but Dara blocked him with a palm lifted like a traffic cop who has a manicure. She told him, without heat, that he had chosen the wrong kind of clever and he needed to choose the other kind before his luck bored itself. He swallowed and looked at Arif as if asking for a version of forgiveness he might somehow deserve, and Arif gave him the kind that has no words and is not forgiveness at all, just the decision to save his mouth for pies and not for men who had been warned.\n\nThey came back into the heat like swimmers who had misjudged the edge of a pool and were resigned to climbing instead of floating. Bram walked beside Arif with his hands in his pockets, which made him look like a person with less to do than he actually had. The street was a slow river of the stubborn and the tired and the genuinely happy, and somewhere close by a woman sold cut guava with salt that made its own weather in your mouth. \u201cFeathers are a cheap symbol,\u201d Bram said after a block, not looking at him and yet speaking to the exact part of Arif that needed speaking to. \u201cPretty, easy to draw, suggests flight and grace but also an ache, because what is a feather without a body. People love ache. They forget depth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is his body,\u201d Arif asked, because men like Jonas do not buy fifty cheap tattoos without admiring a bird that thinks it is a river. \u201cWho lifts his wings when the money is heavy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone with a name that doesn\u2019t belong in a mouth that earns its own money,\u201d Bram said, and his tone was not bored so much as clinical. \u201cA man you\u2019ve seen at docks and offices and tables where women are asked to laugh. He will not approach you yet because you are a story he hasn\u2019t decided the ending of. He will send boys with more nerve than sense. He will experiment with how much lemon it takes to cover a taste people shouldn\u2019t be swallowing.\u201d\n\nArif let that settle like a coin at the bottom of a glass. He did not love the idea of becoming anyone\u2019s experiment again, even in metaphor, and he was surprised at the small joy that accompanied the thought of being boring to the kind of men who made fevers into business models. \u201cThen we bore him,\u201d he said. \u201cWe win the contest, we drink gentle drinks, we sleep, and he finds another bird to pluck.\u201d\n\nBram smiled with one corner of his mouth because he appreciated hope when it dressed itself in work clothes. \u201cAnd while he looks away,\u201d he said, \u201cwe cut the string on his kite.\u201d\n\nThe evening let them go slowly, like a hand hanging on to yours a breath too long and then choosing not to insult you by pretending it had simply forgotten to unclasp. Back at the quay the light had the drowsy tilt of a man who wants to tell another story and cannot decide between a lie and a miracle; the Liris rocked with the particular patience of things built to endure time instead of attention. Lila, who had declared herself unwilling to make any more syrup until the morning ruined itself, produced a pot of rice, a wok that looked like it had participated in six family histories, and a small hill of leftover fried fish that she attacked with a fork until it became something a person could call a new dish without guilt. Arif cleaned two cucumbers with the quick strokes of someone who had learned, young, that water tastes like various truths depending on what you put next to it, and they ate on the stern under a sky that consented to be dramatic without going to the trouble of becoming storm.\n\nSomewhere between second helping and the kind of soft quiet that comes only after the kitchen no longer needs you, the ribbon in Arif\u2019s pocket stopped being just an edge against his thigh and turned into a small bright nerve under his thumb, and he closed his eyes without meaning to. He could feel, for half of one breath, the exact moment last year when the crowd had become large enough that it had its own heartbeat, and he could hear the cheer tilt like a wave and almost break on the sound of cloth tearing when his thumb caught the riband, and his mouth remembered making a joke that made no sense and made perfect sense because his blood had been ninety percent sugar and the rest adrenaline. It was not a whole memory, and it did not deliver the face he had worn that day back to him like a gift, but it left a wet footprint where there had been none, and he cherished it as a man cherishes signs that his boat hasn\u2019t forgotten the channel yet.\n\nHe slept then like a person who had been given permission by a boat and woke with that permission intact. Morning tried out the idea of rain and decided against it, which meant the air was wet anyway and everyone had an extra complaint to carry around. The schedule was a ladder: a vendor round at nine because Lila had arranged swaps with two aunties who had tamarind she coveted and couldn\u2019t be bothered to buy, another rehearsal at eleven that nobody needed and everyone would attend because rehearsal rooms are where gossip is free, and a phrase called \u201csecurity walkthrough\u201d at three that made Arif itch. He watched the quay breathe and spotted, with an uncharitable satisfaction, that the chalk feather had been trampled by a wheelbarrow and then spat on by a man who hated the way the color blue sometimes thought it owned the sky.\n\nIt was Lila who saw the boy first, because her eyes loved intent like a cat loves a half-closed door. He loitered near the stall with the stance of a child who has been told to loiter without getting slapped by an aunt he doesn\u2019t know, and his hand sat in his pocket like it had been tied there. He waited until what he thought would be the perfect unsuspecting moment and moved toward Lila\u2019s prep bench with an insouciance that could have been admirable if it hadn\u2019t been so obvious, and her hand clamped his wrist so fast his whole arm told him truths. The vial he had been carrying went cold and brittle between their fingers, and she lifted it gently as if it were a small glass opinion that might shatter if mishandled.\n\n\u201cInside voice,\u201d she said to him, and then to Arif, \u201cOpen that with your nose, not your hands.\u201d The boy stared at the ground and at the vial and at Lila\u2019s braid like he had only just noticed hair was a thing people owned; he couldn\u2019t have been more than fourteen and he had done very badly at choosing which adults to believe this week. Arif flicked the cap and brought the mouth of the little bottle near without letting it touch skin, and a whiff of something tidy and unfriendly wrote itself in the front of his head. It was a polite cousin of what they had tasted in the A bottle and a poor liar, and it would have made an honest drink taste like a debt.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Lila asked, not unkindly and not gently, and the boy made the small fish mouth that belongs to children who have been bribed by men who do not keep promises. He told them a name he didn\u2019t know how to spell and the location of a gaming shop near Kota Tua where tall men laughed too hard at their own jokes. He held his other wrist with his free hand like the limb warranted sympathy for being caught and confessed, in a rush, that he had been promised a pair of shoes that make YouTube boys tall if he would pour this where told and then leave it because he was stupid and the shoes were beautiful and his mother\u2019s back hurt and the world told him stories in which handsome men are forgiving.\n\nPak Kacek had watched the entire exchange with the calm of a storm that hasn\u2019t decided which village to pick up yet. He stepped closer now and the boy flinched out of habit, then relaxed when he realized this was not a man who hit children in front of other people. \u201cYou will take those shoes,\u201d Pak decreed, which earned him a scandalized look from both Lila and Arif that pleased him very much. \u201cYou will take them, you will sell them to a person who collects ugly things and does not run, and you will bring your mother a bag of rice and a duck. Then you will come to me on Tuesday and learn to tie a knot I can trust. If you don\u2019t arrive, I will assume you tripped on your own lie and drowned and I will send a ghost to your house who eats only shoes.\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded with the awe that belongs to threats that include poultry and supernatural consequences, and Lila handed him a parcel of fritters and a bottle of proper lemon syrup and told him this was the kind of sweetness that did not ask his mouth to forget its manners. The vial went into Bram\u2019s pocket later with the look of a man who collected other men\u2019s laziness for fun, and when, in the afternoon, Arif stood on the stage and was told once again to lift his chin so the camera could see his soul, he did it without flinching because some parts of the day had opted for comedy instead of horror and he intended to thank them by participating.\n\nThe night before the final laid itself across the city like a blanket a grandmother would approve of\u2014weighty enough to dampen nonsense, light enough to allow breath. Lila closed the shutter on her stall earlier than her enemies would have dared, announced to the alley that tomorrow was for shouting and today was for boiling water and rubbing feet, and accepted the scandalized murmurs as her due. They walked the long way back to the Liris because the longer you take getting to a bed the better it rewards you, and under the footbridge someone had drawn three chalk feathers and then drawn a boat over them, and the boat had a mast that leaned like an ear. Arif looked down at it and, without smiling, felt the mule in his chest stop kicking so hard.\n\nHe sat on the deck while the harbor talked to itself, the ribbon under his thumb and the taste of cinnamon and citrus at the back of his tongue the way a good song sits behind your teeth. He let his breath lengthen because he would ask it to do ugly work tomorrow and he wanted to be grateful in advance. He thought about the faces he would not have to look at when the lights hit him, about the hands he would hear more than see, about the discipline of letting your eyes soften past cameras to focus on a cousin\u2019s silhouette that would stand at the very back of the tent where the shadows could do their job. He thought, ferociously and with a simplicity that shocked him into laughter, about eating. He imagined the first crust and the second and how he would not let sweet become his enemy until he was ready to set the knife down himself, and he promised the part of him that knew how to listen to the sea that he would come back to his own deck after and not belong to anyone else\u2019s table.\n\nSleep took him with both hands and put him down in a place he recognized, and, just before the floor under him turned into the first swell of a dream, he felt the raw edge of a ribbon press against his thumb and knew, with an absolute that required no witness, that even if the rest of the memory refused him, that one sound, tear and cheer braided together, would not leave. When he woke, it was with that sound still in his mouth and the light on the ceiling doing its best to be gentle, and outside, the harbor cleared its throat as if it had something important to say and wanted to make sure he heard it. He reached for the letter before he reached for his cigarettes, folded it back along the crease he had almost broken, and put it into his pocket like a quiet flag. Then he went up into the morning to find Lila hunched over her pot like a soldier over a map, ready to tell him where to place his feet and how to keep them there when the world tried to move him.The morning decided to be noisy in a clean way, a kind of bustle that made the harbor\u2019s complaints sound like encouragement, and for once Arif let the racket enter him without sorting it into categories he could fix or ignore. Lila had mapped the day on a scrap of cardboard with arrows and insults, and she moved between her pots with the precision of someone who had invented muscle memory out of stubbornness. The lemon peels sat like curled tongues on the board, the ginger wore its dirt like jewelry, and the palm sugar broke under her spoon with a sound that made the alley pause because it resembled success. Arif took the crate of bottles and rinsed them with a fastidiousness that would have made a pharmacist proud, then stood a moment with his hands in the sink because the water was the exact temperature of a shouted blessing and he had discovered he could collect himself better when his knuckles were submerged. He caught his reflection in the steel and gave it a nod that wasn\u2019t bravado and wasn\u2019t apology, then set about arranging the labels Lila had written in her hurried square hand, each one like a piece of her personality stuck to glass.\n\nSatria arrived before his shadow like a man who had remembered to be early but hadn\u2019t remembered what to do with the time, and he hovered at the edge of the stall wringing his radio as if it were laundry. He had a list and the list was annoyed with him, and he delivered his reminders to the air more than to the people who needed to receive them because he had learned that speaking toward Lila directly this week resulted in bruises to his pride. Security would sweep vendor lanes at ten; the sponsor wanted an insert piece at eleven where contestants pretended to choose their favorite pies; the press wanted a walk-through shot at noon where Gerry would say \u201ccommunity\u201d five times. Lila handed him a cup of warm syrup-water before he had finished the third item and watched him drink like a mother with an opinion about posture, and when he smacked his lips in surprise at the absence of bitterness she allowed herself a small smirk and called it breakfast so he couldn\u2019t argue that she had fed him.\n\nBy midmorning the fairground had put on its festival clothes with conviction. Banners that yesterday had looked like laundry now pretended to be flags, and the Mariana Tent swelled with a pride that had very little to do with fabric and a lot to do with the cables that were finally tensioned correctly. Arif walked the edge of the space the way he walked the Liris\u2019s deck after a storm, checking lines and corners for the sort of wrongness you can\u2019t name until it taps you on the shoulder. He greeted Bu Dewi, who had commandeered a corner of a prep table with the authority of a queen on a small throne, and she thumped his chest with the back of her fingers and told him to stop acting like a man about to pray and act like a man about to chew. He glanced toward the service corridor that had tried to swallow his cousin and felt nothing but a brief, clean anger, a steel wire stretched under his breastbone that hummed only when someone pushed against it.\n\nDara appeared as if the tent had manufactured her, a pleasure of silk where there had recently only been canvas, and stood with her hands clasped behind her back like a teacher evaluating whether to pass a troublesome class. Bram drifted at her shoulder, which made their pairing look like punctuation in a sentence that intimidated commas. They checked the carts discreetly and then not discreetly, which achieved not only security but also a performance of it that discouraged improvisation. When Gerry came flapping like a pelican with a clip-on mic, Dara allowed him to stand too close for thirty seconds, then pulled him away by his jacket lapel with such elegance he thanked her after and did not know why. Jonas passed the far end of the tent and didn\u2019t pass in, which suited everyone, and the boy with the new toothbrush\u2019s neck looked raw where the ink had been scrubbed, which made Arif feel a dark, petty satisfaction he did not examine closely.\n\nThe press rehearsal was chaos with excellent lighting, and Arif said his name and the name of his boat four times for four different cameras and made sure to say his cousin\u2019s name every time so that any story told later without her in it would look shabby. He discovered that if he held the microphone slightly farther from his mouth than anyone suggested, the sound man smiled like a man blessed with mercy, and he made a point of liking the sound man so that he could like the whole process more. When a woman in a blazer asked him what pie meant to him and refused to accept \u201can opportunity to eat politely in public\u201d as an answer, he spoke about crust and labor and the way a country\u2019s arguments become food that refuses to taste like an argument, and she blinked as if the response had contained a small philosophy she would have to edit around. Lila, just off camera, rolled her eyes and drew a small boat on the corner of her clipboard, and when he glanced at her scribble he nearly laughed into the mic and had to pretend he was coughing instead.\n\nBackstage felt like the inside of a chest about to inhale, and the contestants who had done this before radiated the calm of people who have eaten too much and learned not to die. The stout woman with the headscarf who had taken second last year\u2014you couldn\u2019t think of her as anything but Kak Ayu once you had heard her scold a nephew through a mouthful of pastry\u2014stood beside him and tested the seat of the stool as if preparing to argue with it, and she handed him a rubber band with a solemnity reserved for sacred rites. He looked at it with question written across his face and she wrapped it around his wrist herself, not tight, and told him that when the sugar began to talk nonsense he should snap it once to remind his blood of salt. He nodded and thanked her like a man just given a charm by a witch in a market, and when she winked with half a lid and told him not to embarrass her by fainting, he promised to embarrass her in other ways instead.\n\nThey called the finalists to the curtains because men with clipboards always appear in multiples, and Satria executed his one indispensable function: he made eye contact with Arif and used his eyebrows to ask a question about readiness that contained apology, gratitude, and panic. Arif nodded in a way that gave him an excuse to walk away to harass someone else. The noise in the tent thickened, laughter piling on laughter until the roof had something heavier than fabric to hold up, and the front rows filled with aunties who would judge everything and still cheer, teenagers who filmed each other\u2019s faces instead of the stage, and a smattering of men who liked to explain to their dates what eating is. Somewhere in the middle was a seat saved by someone important who had texted that they were on their way, and Arif decided he would pretend no such person existed because he had learned that invisible people take up the most room.\n\nHe stood, just inside the curtain\u2019s shadow, and watched the first wave of introduction wash over the tent. The emcee had the voice of a man who could make a riot feel like a raffle and he said Arif\u2019s name with that rolling grandeur that makes syllables stick together, and the crowd made the right noise at the right time, which is the kind of mercy performers spend lifetimes craving. He stepped out into the light and let the heat strike him like an oath, and he chose his pace the way you choose a path across a moving deck, slow enough to be stubborn, quick enough to be polite. He did not look for Lila because he had promised her and himself not to, and instead he looked at the top edge of the tent where the canvas turned into sky, and the line held like a sentence he could finish. When the emcee handed him a ribboned garland to wear later and the ribbon\u2019s end brushed his hand, a small electric bolt ran up his thumb to his jaw, and he put the sensation in his pocket beside the actual strip of blue and the letter, folded almost to death.\n\nThe first round was savory, as if the tournament wished to prove that it had learned restraint since last year\u2019s festival of sugar. Beef rendang wrapped in flaky pastry that threw crumbs like confetti at every attempt to be dignified, a jackfruit curry pie that smelled like someone\u2019s cousin telling a story loudly and well, and a mushroom thing that declared politely it would not be anyone\u2019s favorite and therefore would last long enough to be remembered. Arif took the stool and planted his feet as if he intended to grow roots through the plywood and into the ground, and he accepted the first plate with a small bow to the auntie who handed it to him because he had decided all hands that fed him would be acknowledged. The water pitchers were arranged exactly as Bu Dewi had insisted, and he took a breath in the space between first bite and second that had been paced his whole body for him, and he began.\n\nIt was not a storm at first. It was a river that understood where it was going and did not panic about the bends. The rendang brought heat that sat like an educated older relative on his shoulder and advised him not to rush, and he nodded internally and obeyed, letting the flakes do their work, letting warm water carry corners where they needed to go. He let his jaw be a machine he did not manage, only monitored, and when the emcee shouted something he didn\u2019t catch, the crowd\u2019s answer washed over him and left nothing behind but a thin residue of approval that did not distract. He had thought he would need to think of fishing to survive the stage, but it turned out that all he needed to think about was bite, swallow, breathe, and the way his tongue could be told to enjoy salt without betraying him to thirst.\n\nHe glanced once, allowed himself that, to the back corner where the tent met the darker air, and saw the angle of Lila\u2019s jaw and the quirk at the corner of her mouth she thought made her look stern and actually made her look like home. She was not counting animals this time; she was counting backward by lemon peels, which he recognized because he had watched her do it when she thought twice at once. When his eyes flicked front again, they caught Kak Ayu\u2019s grin, and the older woman exaggerated a breath and a swallow for him as if they were teammates in a game nobody else understood, and he obeyed her because she was right. The buzzer for the first round went off with a triumphal whine that had ambitions, and he put his hands in his lap a second before it sounded, just to practice letting go before something wrenched letting go out of him.\n\nBetween rounds Gerry swanned onstage with a silver tray to do a sponsor gag and managed not to drop anything, which caused the audience to clap too hard because there is always a certain relief in the avoidance of a small disaster. Dara offered a polite wave with fingers barely separated enough to constitute a gesture, and Jonas hovered, applauding with the air of a man who would like to be mistaken for someone better while hoping no one asks for specifics. Satria looked like someone had told him he could go home early if no speakers caught fire, and he took his new privilege seriously. Arif took the opportunity to stretch his hands, flex his throat with warm water, and let his gaze pass over the tent like a searchlight looking for nothing, because sometimes the looking soothes without needing to find.\n\nThe second round brought fruit pies the tent had argued about for weeks in kitchens and group chats. There was apple, because it soothed the anxieties of judges who had learned their English from television, but the apples had been convinced to grow in Indonesian pastry, which made them less pious and more fun. There was soursop, which tried to be shy and failed in a charming way, and a pineapple that bit back just enough to flirt. The durian tart did not appear yet because Bu Dewi had declared it a finale and nobody with any sense argued with her. Arif let the sweetness come and did not let it stay, ushering each mouthful along with a city bus conductor\u2019s efficiency, a hand hovering, a nod, an insistence. He felt, once or twice, the sugar whispering an invitation to a dream, and he took the rubber band and let it kiss his wrist with that clean snap that felt like a boyhood game, and the whisper went away to bother someone else.\n\nHalfway through the pineapple, with his mouth in that exact balance between grateful and polite, the garland\u2019s loose ribbon end brushed his thumb again, and for a second the tent shifted and he was standing in the exact light he had stood in last year. The noise bent like sugar glass, and he saw himself laughing with a garland crooked, the blue edge under his thumb, Lila\u2019s face shining in a way he had not allowed himself to think about because it felt like stealing from a version of himself he could not name. He felt the heat of a hand on the back of his neck that could only have been Pak Kacek\u2019s, steady and vulgar and loving, pushing him back toward the stage when he had staggered off it too quickly. The sensation lasted the length of a swallow and then collapsed, but it left behind a map he did not have to hold to follow.\n\nHe did not let the map make him faster. He did not let it make him sentimental. He used it like a skipper uses the feel of a particular crosscurrent under his hull, a fraction of a correction here that makes the turn more elegant an hour hence. When the emcee, hungry for drama, asked him to show the crowd how a champion enjoys a pie, he put his mouth on a slice of apple and chewed slow enough for the first row to laugh at their own nervousness, then broke the pace so hard that the laughter turned into a cheer because people love to be wrong in the correct direction. He could feel his body beginning to treat sugar like a friend who had overstayed, and he fed it warm water and a thought about salt and carried it into the next round with firm courtesy.\n\nSavory returned to rescue the tent from itself. The organizers called it Tradition and then giggled at their own audacity because nothing that uses shredded chicken and coconut so sincerely is truly traditional in a city that changes recipes whenever a wind blows from another island. The pies had names that made the emcee pronounce vowels with reverence and for once his choice was correct, and the smell of lemongrass under butter made more than one auntie elbow the person next to her and declare that this, at least, tasted the way memory claims. Arif took the chicken lemongrass, smiled at the fact that his hands did not shake, and let the bird and the grass tell his jaw where to go.\n\nHe felt the wobble at the edge of his knees three bites later the way you feel a floor flex on a ferry and know someone loaded a truck wrong, and he set the pie down for exactly two counts like a man refuses to be rushed and then picked it up again without drama. Kak Ayu snorted with approval and increased her own pace because she had been waiting for him to remember that grace is a show you give the audience to convince them not to worry about you, and as he matched her, a chant began in the back of the tent that had nothing to do with names and everything to do with mouth sounds people make when their bodies want permission to shout. He felt the tent open like a lung, and he breathed with it, and it gave some of its air back to him as if it had made it in the first place just so that he could take it.\n\nThe finale arrived like a relative you had been dreading and were delighted to see anyway. Bu Dewi\u2019s durian tart came borne by two aunties who knew not to tilt the plate because dignity is not a liquid, and even the men who claim to hate the fruit looked interested because they admired bravado. The emcee did not try a joke because he had learned, if not humility, then at least when to fear it, and he stood back with his microphone like a man giving space to an avalanche. The smell walked down the first row and slapped every nose and was slapped back with adoration, and Arif felt something similar to love and decided he would tell nobody that because it would ruin three people\u2019s afternoons.\n\nHe took his slice and let the fat and the sugar and the echo of something alchemical sit on his tongue just long enough to remind his brain what to call it, then pushed it along politely with warm water and a strict instruction to his throat not to be clever. The second bite tried to announce itself as the one that would make him slow dramatically in a way that cameras could interpret as vulnerability, and he pushed past it with the moral superiority of a man who has been lectured by a cousin wearing lipstick. He tasted a note in the custard that was not Bu Dewi\u2019s and realized she had been merciful and added a whisper of citrus to calm the extravagant animal, and he sent her gratitude with a side-eye and a nod and she received it with a snort and a raised spoon like a salutation.\n\nHe heard the cheer begin in the back again, the one with no name, the one that belonged to mouths and lungs and the question of whether any of us are ever doing anything except proving we can use the bodies we are in, and under it he heard the thready sound of ribbon scraping thumb, not from fabric but from memory, and he let himself press into it as he took the next mouthful. He did not speed up. He did not slow down. He reached the end of his plate before he had planned to by three swallows and let the space sit empty because he would not be ruled by the space any more than by the plate, and he took water into himself like a promise instead of a hedge against fear.\n\nIt became evident, in that not-dramatic way that good narratives become evident, that the contest was between him and Kak Ayu again, and the cameras thirsted like bad friends for a frame they could put on thumbnails, and Arif and the woman chose to give them something better. They widened their jaws with a shared joke and then narrowed their eyes as if demanding the pies try harder, and they moved hunger out of theater and into craft. When the emcee went too close to Kak Ayu with his microphone, she did not swat him; she fed him a crumb with such authority the front row roared, and when the camera dipped too close to Arif\u2019s face he gave it the expression he had saved, the one that said this is work, not spectacle, but lucky you, you get to watch.\n\nThe buzzer that ended the round did not sound like anything but a buzzer; it did not carry glory in its mouth, and Arif was grateful for that because he did not want glory to sound like a machine. He set his hands in his lap again, the habit now a rhythm rather than a rehearsal, and he let himself turn his head. The back of the tent had gone into that slow-motion quiet that happens when bodies forget to coordinate, and Lila\u2019s chin was up and her eyes were shining in a way that no longer hurt him to see because he had earned the right to be looked at like that again. He exhaled and let his shoulders drop and realized they had been up around his ears, and then he stood because the emcee had said something like \u201ccount\u201d and numbers had their way with tables and people\u2019s breath.\n\nThe tally took long enough for three stupid things to have happened and none did, which felt like a gift. Someone tried to start a wave and gave up. A small boy asked his mother if champions get to choose their own bedtimes and was told yes by a woman who knew how to keep men happy. Gerry whispered at Dara and got a no with such elegance he found himself smiling as if the refusal had been dessert, and Satria stared at a cable tie like it had offended his religion. Bram leaned near a support column with his hands in his pockets and the ghost of a smile and met Arif\u2019s gaze and tipped his head half a degree in the universal language of men who are ready to do something quietly violent if anyone asks them to, and Arif tipped his head back the exact measure that says Not today, thank you.\n\nWhen the emcee stretched the last syllable of Arif\u2019s name as if trying to make it into a bridge and then screamed it as if he were birthing it himself, the tent breathed and the roof held and the cheering landed on Arif\u2019s shoulders like birds who had chosen him. He did not pretend to be surprised because the kind of false humility that impresses strangers would have hurt his friends; he let delight register because he wanted to see it on Lila\u2019s face like sunrise. He went forward without bounding, because bounding belongs to men who think the world owes them the kind of romance that makes ankles break, and he accepted the ribboned garland\u2014a new one, ridiculous and perfect\u2014and the trophy shaped like a pie and as heavy as an insult. He felt the blue again under his thumb and this time when it tore, because it would always tear, because the edge was wrong for the knot, he tore it deliberately and offered the torn end to Kak Ayu like a shared dessert, and she snatched it with a grin and bit it for the camera and the photo was the kind of photo people will put above their televisions when they need to remember that theater is a trustworthy liar.\n\nHe laughed. It was the same laugh as the one on the board and it was not, because last year\u2019s laugh had been full of surprise and sugar and a young man\u2019s invincibility, and this year\u2019s carried the weight of a freezer and a canal and a boy with a toothbrush and a woman in a tamarind dress telling him to choose his fights. It tasted like cinnamon and citrus and salt because Lila had added salt to everything that week, including Arif\u2019s illusions, and he laughed until he had to put the trophy down because he is not a man who loves props. He leaned into Kak Ayu\u2019s side as if she were a cousin and said something about rice that made only their row laugh, and then he straightened and did the one indulgence he had promised himself he would allow if the crowd permitted it. He faced the back of the tent like it was his real stage and bowed his head for half a beat, and when he lifted it Lila was wiping her cheek with the heel of her hand with a ferocity that insisted the tear was a mistake, and he believed her because it made her happy to be believed.\n\nThe afterpieces were the same kind of nonsense they are everywhere, no matter the country. Photographs he would not want to look at later and would be forced to, microphones thrust like a plant you don\u2019t remember planting that needs watering right now, offers to take his jacket off and put another one on because someone needed a story about transformation. He did his duty and smiled at two children who had been bribed with balloons to care about pastry, and he held up a slice of something for a camera and did not put it in his mouth, and he stood for a group of bakers who wanted a picture for their wall and meant it when he told them he would come and eat their cakes and give them honest opinions. He did not allow Gerry to drape the Blue Heron jacket over his shoulders, and when the man persisted and flirted with the edge of flustered, Dara rescued them both by performing the kind of small social surgery that leaves nobody bleeding and everyone grateful.\n\nHe slipped offstage not like a thief but like a man finished with a job, and the backstage corridor made a sound like a kettle cooling because the energy had to go somewhere and decided to evaporate. Lila met him halfway to the water coolers and slipped her fingers into his and squeezed once so hard his bones chimed, and then she let go and punched him in the shoulder because this felt safer under a tent full of people who love to talk. He bent his head and she stood on her toes and he kissed her forehead because nobody could make that vulgar and because some gestures needed to be taught to anyone watching, and then they stood a second with their foreheads almost touching and let the noise go over them like the after-blow of a wave that had decided not to capsize a small boat after all.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d she said, and shoved a banana fritter at his mouth as if it were medicine, because in her hands it was, and he obeyed and felt the grease chase the sugar out and go sit in his stomach like a caretaker on a night shift. \u201cDrink. Sit. Don\u2019t say yes to anything that asks for your soul. Only give them the parts you can regrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich parts are those?\u201d he asked, and she pretended to check his elbows like a butcher being practical.\n\n\u201cThe laugh,\u201d she decided. \u201cKeep lending that out. And the way you breathe when you decide not to be afraid. That one you can give to anyone who asks nicely. Keep the ribbon. Keep the way you look at boats.\u201d\n\nBack by the service carts Bram affected the disinterest of a man who has used a whole day\u2019s quota of interest and finds he has an emergency reserve anyway, and he inclined his head at the trophy, then at Arif\u2019s face, in that order because he had opinions about sequence. There was a flash of something like pride in him that he did not allow to take up the whole room, and then he moved as if he were about to go chase a different problem with a net, and Arif stopped him with a hand on his sleeve because there were too many things in him that might become foolish if not given to someone safe. He thanked him with words that were not elaborate and that made Bram glance down once like he had heard a bird that is rare in the city, and then Bram told him, with a casualness that was a lie for his benefit, that the man with the ring had been quiet since noon, which in their world meant a lawyer had told him to hibernate.\n\nOutside the tent the late afternoon had chosen drama after all and stacked clouds in layers like a cake for a wedding that would end in a fight, and there was wind on the water that smelled like change and the burnt electricity of machines who are bored of themselves. The crowd spilled into the midway in a version of happiness that did not involve anyone shouting at anyone else, and vendors were declaring that their stock had been underestimated and that their hands were tired and that their children would eat and the television would be loud. Arif found himself imagining the harbor at night when he was a boy, and how he had lain on his back and told Lila names of foreign boats like an aunt telling gossip, and he felt as stupidly lucky as a man who has jumped a wave and landed with both ankles willing.\n\nThe Blue Heron after-party sat on the city\u2019s tongue like a bet it intended to win, and there was work left to do there that had nothing to do with pastry. Dara had promised to build a drink that tasted like money without making anybody a liar, and she had promised to teach men the limits of feathers, and Lila had promised to make syrup that made your mouth remember kindness first and none of them were in the habit of breaking promises made under tent lights. Arif thought of the freezer and the canal and the boy and the toothbrush and the ugly shoes that might yet become rice and a duck, and he decided he would go to a club and stand in a corner and not drink anything with a name because he would rather watch a woman who could fold a room into a better shape do her work.\n\nAt the Liris, Pak Kacek had tied the line in a way that said he was showing off for anyone who might be watching, which is to say, the boat. He saw them approach with their ridiculous trophy and their smaller ridiculous garland and made a face like he disapproved of celebrations that required dusting, then kissed the trophy, very quickly, when he thought nobody would see. He told a story about a sailor who won a pig at a fair by guessing its weight and then had to carry it home because the pig refused to be led, and he told it in such a way that the moral could have been anything from \u201cchoose your prizes with wisdom\u201d to \u201ctie better knots\u201d and he left them to decide which because good educators are lazy and proud. Lila held up the ribbon strip and he took it without asking for explanation and made of it a loop he could tie to a place near the companionway where good-luck garbage lives on boats, and he put a knot in it that would only come undone if insulted.\n\nThey ate, modestly, because their bodies had had enough indignity for one day, and they sat with their feet up in a way that would have made their grandmothers scold and their grandfathers grin, and they made a plan that was not a plan so much as a list of where to stand and who to deflect and what to avoid being photographed doing. They agreed not to wake Bu Dewi because she would wake herself when her brain decided to swing its lantern around the room of her ideas, and they agreed to take the long road to the club because the short road had too many men who loved putting their hands on other people\u2019s backs to steer them.\n\nAt Blue Heron the door had learned to smile, which is to say the doorman had had a conversation with humility, and the heron on the wall lifted its metal head not at all because art has nothing to say to days like these. Inside, the room had been altered in small ways that would only be noticed by people who make and break rooms for a living. The bar\u2019s back shelf held Lila\u2019s bottle in pride of place, not by label because she didn\u2019t have one, but by aura, and Dara stood with one hip against the wood like a general in peacetime. The men with rings and jackets looked like men who had been shown a boundary and decided to live, for now, on the safe side of it, and Gerry was overacting his own good behavior so hard it became charming despite itself.\n\nThere were toasts. There are always toasts. Dara raised her glass not high, because you don\u2019t need God to watch you for truth, and spoke about work and mouths and how it is rude to build a city with your waist and your back and then pretend the mouths are decoration. She did not say Jonas\u2019s name and did not look at him and the omission made him smaller than any insult could have achieved. Bram said nothing and the nothing was generous. Lila accepted three compliments and corrected one recipe and refused to take money for the first batch of syrup because she had decided the proper payment would be in favors owed and a small plaque near the bathroom that said \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid\u201d in a nice font. Arif, who had no gift for clubs, stood with his back to a column and watched men pretend their hearts had never been dangerous.\n\nHe saw him then, not because the man had announced himself but because the room tilted half a degree and his eyes, newly taught to read that particular tilt, followed without his consent. Not Jonas, not the ring, not the boy, but the person their feathers dreamed of being attached to, the one who had hired impatience as a personality. He was not tall or short and his suit did not have a seam out of place and his shoes had a softness to their shine that indicated calfskin and a deliberate decision to never cross a road without a car waiting for him. He had a face that would not survive humor and eyebrows that had practiced disapproval in the mirror until it looked natural. He did not look at Arif, because men like him do not look at sailors until sailors have made a mess, and for a moment Arif felt the old compressor of his chest try to turn on and he unplugged it because there was nothing that needed pressure right now.\n\nDara approached the man as if they were opposite teams instructed to act like cousins at a funeral. She smiled with the precise number of teeth that make rich men behave, and she said something inaudible and the man did that quick little shake of the head men do when they are refusing something they consider beneath them, which made Bram\u2019s mouth quirk in a way that meant somebody had just made a list longer. The three of them stood in a triangle that looked like a math problem and then the triangle solved itself with a shrug and a nod and a later, and the man drifted away like a large fish that has decided the net looks too expensive to be worth chewing.\n\nLila slid beside Arif and slid a glass into his hand and told him to drink because it would be bad manners to refuse to honor the part of the day that didn\u2019t require a napkin. He sipped and felt her syrup behave the way it had promised it would\u2014sharp where sophistication tends to lie, sweet where nostalgia pretends to be honest, bitter only in memory. She leaned into his side like she had chosen to and not because her ankles had lost interest in standing, and they watched Dara make the room do as it was told with posture and a smile and a casual sentence about a river that made three men look at their shoes. They did not speak for a while, because mouths sometimes improve a scene by closing.\n\nWhen they left, the club let them, which is not a kindness you can count on. The night outside was honest and held no adjectives beyond wet and electric, and the walk back felt like a procession of two that nobody else needed to witness. The garland had lost two pastry leaves and they ate them with indecent pleasure because stealing from symbols makes them feel useful. The harbor sang the song it always sings when it is ready to be a mirror, and the Liris lifted them as if to prove a point to the other boats watching. Lila went below with a declaration about washing her face until it remembered mercy, and Arif stood at the rail with his fingers on the ribbon loop and his thumb worrying the little raw edge he had made on purpose, and he allowed himself to close his eyes and see two versions of himself stacked like transparencies and feel less anger at the space between them than he would have thought he was allowed.\n\nHe slept a smaller sleep that did not feel cheated, and he woke before the alarm he did not set and the day after the day felt like a piece of bread someone had warmed just for him. He found Lila in the galley pouring tea as if pouring tea were an offensive art, and she handed him a cup without looking up and told him she had dreamt of feathers turning into noodles and he told her that meant the day would be good because noodles fill people in a way feathers don\u2019t. He checked the letter out of habit and put it away faster than he had yesterday because it was now a souvenir and not a guide, and he stood on deck with his hands braced and smelled a morning that had decided to be human.\n\nThere would be interviews to be bothered by, and a return to Bu Dewi\u2019s to be fed whether he agreed or not, and a visit from a boy who might bring a duck if the world had behaved, and a network of men with rings and wrists who had reconsidered their feathers. There would be a new job for Lila to refuse three times before deciding to accept on her own terms, and a set of security cameras to reteach to be honest, and a boss of some boys to be shown the place where rivers end as a lesson in humility. There would be, under all of it, the fact that his thumb remembered what ribbons feel like and his mouth remembered where to put its breath and his heart remembered how to let bells ring without thinking they were alarms. He took a sip of tea and let it scald the roof of his mouth a little because it felt correct, and then he turned to tell Lila a stupid joke he had been saving, and the boat leaned, attentive, to hear it.",

                              "content": "The night before the harbor woke, Arif dreamt of a crust flaking under his teeth, of cream splitting like pale foam across his tongue, of cinnamon and something citrus that stung the back of his throat. He woke with his palms sweating and his mouth flooded, like he\u2019d been chewing through a tide. In the dream he heard cheering and saw a ribbon he could almost grab\u2014but nothing else, just flashes. He rolled over and stared at the cracked paint above his bunk and tried to remember more, to find the edges of the dream and press.\n\nMemory, again, slipped like rainwater through his fingers.\n\nA horn grumbled outside. Diesel and brine seeped through the cabin\u2019s slatted door, along with the fry-greasy perfume of early morning warung oil, scattered laughter from the quay. The city was a giant wearing many perfumes. Smoke, cloves, dried fish. A stutter of scooters somewhere near the market alley. The boat creaked around him, the Laut Liris, which had once been a fine new phinisi and was now\u2014depending on who you asked\u2014reliable, modest, or stubborn. Her mast had a tilt that made her look like she was listening. Arif swung his legs down, toes finding cold wood and the familiar scatter of tools he always meant to tidy and never did. He rubbed at the scar behind his right ear, a little pale crescent that felt like it belonged to someone else. That scar was the start of the dark patch\u2014months missing from his head like a salt-eaten map.\n\nHe patted his shirt pocket for his cigarette tin and found, instead, the letter. It was folded and re-folded, the crease almost tearing. He smiled without meaning to. He took it out and let his eyes rest on the messily stamped logo again: Pie Nusantara\u2014Finals, Ancol Dreamland. Beneath it the lines he\u2019d already memorized.\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been selected to participate in the final round of the Pie Nusantara Eating Championship, to be held on\u2026\n\nHe could recite the date now. Three days. A number bright as a buoy marker.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t sure exactly how his name had appeared on their list, or why Lila had laughed that loud crow laugh when he showed it to her two evenings ago. \"Kau, Bang?\" She\u2019d put a hand over her mouth. \"Yes, yes, of course it\u2019s you.\" Her hair had been tucked under a scarf, her wrists inked with temporary henna that peeled at the edges. She\u2019d been slicing limes with the kind of speed that made Arif nervous. \"You forgot again?\" she asked, softening.\n\n\"I\u2026 didn\u2019t forget. I just\u2026 this is not my usual sport.\"\n\nLila had put down the knife. \"You eat like a starved colossus every time you come back from a run. I thought you would be delighted.\"\n\n\"I am,\" he\u2019d said, then immediately tasted the lie. Delight felt odd on him. Too bright for his grey mood. But carrying that letter around helped. It was a small yellow fish in his pocket.\n\nHe dressed and stepped up the companionway into the light. The sun was still low, but heat had already lifted off the concrete and the ropes. The quay of Sunda Kelapa was a long jaw with gaps in the teeth. Boats groaned, ropes cussed, men cursed at crates. Someone somewhere tuned a radio through a river of static. On the stern deck, Pak Kacek, who had never told a story without spinning it into a fable, gestured with a rope like a ringmaster. \"Arif,\" he called, instead of the usual \"Nak.\" The man had decided he was grown when they\u2019d taken the big run to Ketapang and back. \"You look like a goat chewing old paper.\"\n\n\"Dreams,\" Arif said, which was true and also safely vague.\n\n\"You were shouting. Something about lemon.\"\n\n\"Lemon?\" He laughed. \"Maybe. I don\u2019t remember.\"\n\n\"Drink something,\" Pak Kacek advised. \"It keeps the memory from drying into a husk.\" He thumbed toward a thermos the size of a child. \"Also, did you get that letter from the pie people? Lila told my wife who told me who told my neighbor, so it\u2019s very secret and private.\"\n\nArif groaned. \"Not you also.\"\n\n\"I will be your coach,\" Pak announced. \"I know about pies. During the long dry of \u201898 I sailed with a Dutchman who ate only pies. He had pies for breakfast, pies for lunch, pies for sorrow.\"\n\n\"And he survived?\"\n\n\"He died with great happiness,\" Pak said, winking. \"But he had other habits also.\"\n\nArif took the thermos, drank until the metallic tea hit the back of his nose. He breathed and watched the lace of gulls. The letter sat like a tame bird in his pocket. He tried to imagine standing under a white tent with people cheering as he shoved pastry into his mouth. If he squinted, he could almost see it. But it was like trying to focus on fish below the surface. Bends of light, shimmering edges, nothing you could grab.\n\nBy midmorning, they\u2019d unloaded the last of the crates. Durians thumped onto the dock like grenades. A child darted between a stack of coconuts and almost broke his toes. Arif shouted, the boy heard him and scowled. \"Bang, you shout like my mother.\"\n\n\"Then your mother is wise,\" Arif said, and the boy scampered off, tongue stuck out.\n\nHe worked like he always did, hands and body to the wood, shoulders stitched with a steady ache that felt honest. Work placed him somewhere the holes couldn't go. At noon, he slung his bag over his shoulder and made for the warungs outside the Port gate. Lila would be there with her lemon drinks and fish cakes, a stubborn bird in a metal nest. The alleys to the warungs were a world unto themselves. A cat slept on a plate. Radios argued. Fish scales glinted like money on the ground.\n\nLila\u2019s stall was a tin rectangle with a banner that read: Es Jeruk Lila\u2014Manis, Asam, Selamat. She\u2019d added the last word as a joke after three men fake-coughed about health inspections. \"Selamat is good to say,\" she\u2019d explained. \"It covers everything. Hello, safe, congratulations, you not dying today.\"\n\n\"Where is my champion?\" she asked when she saw him, and raised both arms as if he was a triumphant hero returning from battle.\n\n\"Not a champion yet.\"\n\n\"Last year you were so humble also. And then\u2014\" She cut herself off, the smile slipping. \"Sorry.\"\n\nHe blinked. \"Last year what?\"\n\n\"Eat,\" she said, changing. \"Try this new one. I put salt on the rim. Fancy like an expensive place.\"\n\nHe accepted the glass, cold as ice. The salt bit his chapped lips and the sweet lemon washed in, and he had a sharp, hauling tug in his mind, a small sound like a curtain ring sliding. He looked at Lila\u2019s face and it had gone careful. She placed a plate of banana fritters in front of him and used the back of her wrist to wipe her forehead. A fly alighted and she flicked it away, fierce.\n\n\"What did you mean just then,\" he asked. \"Last year\u2026\"\n\n\"You won,\" she said simply. \"Pie Nusantara. You won it. You wore a garland that made you look like a flower. We ate free for a week because all the bakeries wanted to touch my hand. People asked me for selfies because \u2018you\u2019re the cousin of the champion.\u2019 Useless fame, but fame.\"\n\nThe world went slightly soft at the edges, as if he\u2019d stood up too quickly. Arif set the glass back down slowly. The salt rim left a little crown on the wood. \"But I\u2014\"\n\n\"I know,\" Lila said. \"You don\u2019t remember. You remember the race to Pramuka Island, the storm, you remember smacking your head on the bar of the hatch. You remember waking up three days later. You remember me with my hair like a nest and the doctor with his eyes like fried egg. But not\u2026 you don\u2019t remember that week. It went from you. That is how it goes sometimes with heads. You knew for a while after\u2014you remembered for a week, maybe two\u2014then it began to slide. I thought it would come back after Ramadan. It didn\u2019t.\"\n\nArif swallowed and felt the swallow all the way down. It slotted into a dark corner like a puzzle piece. He waited for the embarrassment to arrive and give him a slap. Instead, something else rose. A little bubble of relief. He had kept the feeling that he was missing important things, and here was one, returned to him with Lila\u2019s flat voice and lemon scent. And yet it was terrible. He could not find the memory itself, only the shape it must have left behind.\n\n\"You didn\u2019t tell me,\" he said.\n\n\"You would not have wanted me to pull at it.\" She raised her chin. \"Besides, I told you two months ago. You looked at me like you were watching a show through a wall. I decided I was done pushing.\"\n\nHe let out a long breath. \"I am sorry.\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t say that to me like a prayer. We have other things to say.\" Lila placed both her palms on his hands. Her fingers were sticky with sugar syrup. \"Three days to the final. You got the invitation because you\u2019re the defending champion. The organizer also snapped his finger, said \u2018the audience love a story with a return,\u2019 the way people like to snap. Are you okay with that? I didn\u2019t want to decide for you. I could have hidden the letter. I didn\u2019t. Maybe I am a bad person.\"\n\nHe snorted. \"You are not a bad person.\" He stared at their hands. \"I want to do it. I think\u2014I think there\u2019s a rope attached to it that leads back into the dark. Maybe I can pull.\"\n\n\"Or you can just eat pies and make money. Let me keep my romance narratives for karaoke.\"\n\nHe laughed then, and some tightness loosened. He ate the fritters, and he pretended his heart wasn\u2019t beating quickly. Lila had that effect. She made his problems look like fish that could be netted.\n\nHalfway through his second plate, a man with a comb-over and a shirt printed with tiny anchors approached the stall like a ship sidling. \"You are Lila?\"\n\n\"I am sometimes,\" Lila said, that friendly-sharp tone she had with customers she did not like yet.\n\n\"I\u2019m Satria,\" the man said. \"From Pie Nusantara. The schedule changed. We had a cancellation. Can you come to registration this evening instead of tomorrow?\" He pointed at Arif without looking at his face, paperwork heavier in his hand. \"Our champ.\" He winked like he had learned about winking from old films.\n\nArif did not know whether to be angry that he was being called \u201cour champ\u201d like a pet or amused. \"Today?\"\n\n\"At seven. Mariana Tent. Ancol. Bring your manager.\"\n\n\"Manager?\" Arif echoed, glancing at Lila.\n\n\"She is the manager, right?\" Satria smiled. \"We read the blogs. Everybody loves this cousin story. Very heartwarming. You arrive at the pier together, glorious.\"\n\n\"We are not dogs,\" Lila said mildly.\n\n\"I\u2019ll see you there,\" Satria said, already backing away, body turned half to another stall. \"We will give you the new rule sheet. Please don\u2019t be late. Big sponsor involved. We want to make good impression. Many cameras.\"\n\n\"Many cameras,\" Lila repeated after he left, rolling her eyes. \"Bang, I want you to do this for yourself. Not for Satria\u2019s cameras.\"\n\n\"For myself,\" he said. \"Yes.\" He wasn\u2019t sure if that was true, but it felt right to say out loud. Maybe the truth followed the words like a machine.\n\nThe day carried him like a boat caught by current. He went back to the Liris to check on a balky bilge pump and argue about ropes with Paiman, who believed in square knots like they were religion. He tried to lift pieces of memory in the spare minutes\u2014last year, the week of the contest, the crowd. He got flashes that felt borrowed: something bright, confetti, a boy holding a pie like a steering wheel, Lila crying then laughing immediately. He let them come and pass, like unfamiliar fish in a tank.\n\nAt five, he changed his shirt, combed his hair with a spoon because he couldn\u2019t find his comb, and met Lila outside the gate. She\u2019d washed her face and put on lipstick that made her look like her mother, who had been a singer on a ferry once, and who now lived in Depok with a man who owned three mahjong sets and a smile like a shutter you couldn\u2019t open.\n\n\"Look at you,\" Lila said. \"You look like a nice boy.\"\n\n\"I will ruin it by eating pies like a wild dog.\"\n\n\"You will eat them like a gentleman.\"\n\nThey caught a bus that complained the whole way to Ancol, and watched the city unfold out of the glass. Old neighborhoods with low, tired houses. New towers like spears. A billow of black clouds in the west that promised storm and delivered none. At a red light, a vendor threaded through a line of cars selling tissue boxes, and a small man in a pink helmet passed them on a tiny motorbike carrying a roll of foam as big as a crocodile. Jakarta in all its improbable balance stood around them, and Arif felt a small pride that he belonged to it, even if he belonged like a scar belongs to skin.\n\n\"You won last year,\" he said again, softly, to the window.\n\n\"You did,\" Lila said.\n\n\"Nothing comes. Just the feeling of a hundred hands in the air.\"\n\n\"Maybe you only remember the part that mattered.\"\n\nAncol was sunset light on water, the air full of popcorn noise and ferris wheel joy. Kids dragged balloons like weak moons. There were tents already up, the Mariana a big white thing with scalloped edges and banners with pies bigger than faces printed on them. Arif saw a blond tourist woman biting into a durian tart and making a face like a cat smelling a lemon. He grinned without meaning to.\n\nSatria met them, his anchor shirt now somehow tighter. He had a clipboard and a radio and the expression of a man everyone would ignore. \"Ah! You came. Good.\" He led them through a side flap, past a row of tables covered in cloth the color of teeth, and pointed to an area with a coffee machine. \"Registration first. Then the sponsor will want a word. He has this idea about making the pies\u2026 never mind. He talks. You stand there and nod.\"\n\n\"Who is the sponsor?\" Lila asked.\n\n\"Blue Heron Hospitality. Their new club is near Kota Tua. Exclusive. They want coverage. They are paying for those camera cranes.\"\n\nArif felt a little twist. Blue Heron. He had heard that name snapped from someone\u2019s mouth on the quay. A new place, hidden door, quiet men. He tucked the twist away.\n\nThey filled out forms that asked him about his allergies and his signature and his shoe size, for no reason he could imagine. A girl with purple hair took Lila\u2019s photo and gave her a laminated badge. \"Manager,\" it read, and below it, \"Lila Adidarma,\" spelled almost right.\n\n\"Are we selling lemonade here too?\" Lila asked Arif as she examined the badge.\n\n\"You could,\" he said. \"There\u2019s always a line of people who want sour.\"\n\nThey followed Satria to a low platform where a man in a linen jacket and loafers waited, his hair careful. He had a smile like he practiced it in the mirror. \"Arif,\" he said. \"I\u2019m Gerry. We are very happy to see you back.\" His English had a California lean to it. \"Your story is\u2026 compelling. Man of the sea, the return, the amnesia\u2014\"\n\n\"I didn\u2019t say the word \u2018amnesia\u2019 to you,\" Lila cut in.\n\nGerry widened his practiced smile. \"Everyone knows everything in this city.\" He brought his palms together with a clap. \"I own the Blue Heron. We\u2019re throwing the after-party. I want you to be the first to arrive. Photograph the moment. Our designer made you a jacket.\"\n\n\"A jacket,\" Arif repeated, flat.\n\n\"Gerry loves to dress people,\" Satria said, lifting his eyes to the ceiling. \"Last year he dressed the contestants like pirates. It made sponsors cry.\"\n\n\"Pirates are charming,\" Gerry protested. \"Almost as charming as sailors who can eat pastries like machines. Arif, can we take a photo? Just you and the Blue Heron banner. We\u2019ll just get some\u2026 content. We\u2019ll post. People will come. Everybody\u2019s happy.\"\n\nArif nodded because he couldn\u2019t see how to say no without making Lila\u2019s life harder. He stood against a blue cloth with a painted white bird on it and tried to look\u2026 something. He imagined the taste of lemon again and opened his mouth to mimic what he thought might be confidence. The camera clicked, and then two more times, and then Gerry grabbed his shoulder like a friend. \"Wonderful. We love authenticity.\"\n\nOn their way out, Lila touched his arm and pointed. Near the exit flap was a board with photos pinned on, last year\u2019s winners and the year before, with captions. There he was. No question. Mouth smeared with filling, hair messier than now, eyes lit as if someone had switched them on from behind. He wore a garland made of pastry leaves. He was laughing, shoulder to shoulder with a stout woman in a headscarf who had won second. He was somebody in that photo. He was also a stranger.\n\n\"Look at you,\" Lila whispered.\n\nHe looked. He remembered nothing from that exact arrangement of atoms, not the angle of the garland on his collarbone, not the shape of the tent behind him. But his chest drew tight in a way that resembled joy. He reached out and his fingertips touched the edge of the photo. It was warm from the tent\u2019s light. He wondered if touching a picture could pull the memory out of the paper like oil from a rope.\n\n\"Those are good times,\" a voice said behind them. Arif turned to find an old woman in an apron, face seamed and eyes bright. \"You are the boy. The one who ate all my apple pies.\" Her chuckle was a rustling sound. \"I had to make more. You dropped your trophy and laughed like a donkey.\"\n\n\"I did?\" He grinned. \"I would never drop a trophy.\"\n\n\"You were shaking with sugar,\" she said. \"We thought you would die and make bad publicity. But you lived.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\" Lila asked.\n\n\"Bu Dewi. I bake. I baked at my husband for thirty years. He still didn\u2019t rise.\" She hooted at her own joke. \"You will come by tomorrow. I have durian tart. I make it so it doesn\u2019t smell like socks.\"\n\n\"We will come,\" Lila promised.\n\nBy the time they spilled out into the lights of the park, it was full dark, the ferris wheel LEDs cycling through blues that made the water look like metal. Arif\u2019s head hummed. He needed to sit. Instead, Lila tugged at his sleeve. \"Before we go,\" she said, \"I have to meet someone. Five minutes.\" She ducked into a pocket of shadow near a vendor selling ice cream shaped like fish. \"I\u2019ll be right back.\"\n\n\"Who, at this hour?\" He tried to joke. \"Your secret rich boyfriend?\"\n\nShe put a hand on his chest and pushed. \"Don\u2019t be an uncle. Wait. Get me a fish ice cream. The red bean one, not chocolate. I\u2019ll be back before it melts.\"\n\nHe watched her slip into a narrower corridor between tents, where cables lay like snakes. She was steady on her feet, small but strong. He bought two ice creams anyway, hands cold, eyes tracking the space where she had disappeared. He waited through a whistle blown by a man selling balloons, through a song played by a busker with a broken string, through a minute and then five. He bit the tail off one of the fish and let sweet red paste meet his tongue. He checked the time on the dead face of his watch and then remembered it had stopped at three seventeen three weeks ago.\n\nHe went round to the back of the tents. The corridor was dim but not empty, workers moving crates, a woman on a phone saying \"I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\" over and over. He found the spot where he thought Lila had turned and looked. Empty. He called her name and a man shushed him because people were filming nearby. He went farther, glanced behind equipment cases, pushed open a flap that led to a space of ladders and buckets. Nothing. Anger pricked then concern swallowed it.\n\nA cleaner leaned on his broom, watching Arif peer around like a cat. \"Bang, you lose something?\"\n\n\"My cousin. She came through here. Scarf, gray jacket. Pretty, would hit you with her words if you were stupid.\"\n\n\"Many pretty girls with gray jackets,\" the cleaner said, bored, then frowned, thoughtful. \"There was a girl talking to a man in a blue jacket. Like sea blue. Not police, club type. He had a bird on his sleeve. Blue bird.\" He gestured with his broom. \"They went toward the back gate.\"\n\nHe imagined Lila rolling her eyes at a man with a jacket and walking away. But the cleaner\u2019s face made something shrivel. \"Blue Heron,\" Arif said.\n\n\"Yes, Bang. New place. Very expensive. My cousin says they make drinks like perfume.\"\n\nArif balanced the two melting fish-shaped ice creams and walked toward the back gate. His mouth was dry again in a way that no lemon could touch. The gate led onto a service road with a row of trucks. No sign of Lila. He called her name again and a dog barked somewhere. A shadow moved and vanished. The ice cream began to make a sticky river onto his fingers. He threw one fish away into a bin. He kept the other, superstitious.\n\nHe flagged an ojek with a whistle, and the driver, a boy with hair he\u2019d dyed white at the tips, pulled up, cocky. \"Where, Bang?\"\n\n\"Kota Tua. Blue Heron club.\"\n\n\"Sudah malam, Bang. It\u2019s expensive.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not buying it,\" Arif snapped, climbed onto the back anyway. \"Just drive.\"\n\nJakarta at night was a neon river and a patience test. The bike slid through jams and around buses that wheezed exhaust into their faces. Arif pressed his palm against his pocket and felt the letter like a talisman. He had a sudden image of Lila looking unimpressed at an expensive chandelier, of her finger poking a waiter\u2019s chest, of her making a joke the wrong man didn\u2019t think was funny. He shook his head. Lila was not someone who vanished. Lila was a person who filled the air with her opinions and left sugar on your fingers. Fear kept trying to find a chair in him and he refused to let it sit.\n\nKota Tua had its ghost look on, the old buildings lit up and hollow, like stage sets. Arif told the driver to stop before the square. He paid, including for the boy\u2019s grievance about the hour, and walked along a side street where a man with a hat sold cigarettes from a briefcase. The Blue Heron\u2019s door was not a door. It was a piece of wall a man would ignore if he didn\u2019t know what he was seeing. A very tall doorman stood in front of it, his suit too perfect. A thin blue heron silhouette in metal was set into the cement, no signage. No need.\n\n\"Member?\" the doorman asked, eyes sliding over Arif\u2019s work-worn clothes with professional disdain.\n\n\"My cousin is inside. Lila. She came with a man with a bird on his sleeve.\"\n\nThe doorman barely blinked. \"We can check.\" He had the voice of a man who knew people always had urgent reasons that were not enough. He touched his earpiece, said something, waited for static to answer. \"No Lila in our system.\"\n\n\"She would not give her name to your system. She would give you an argument.\" Anger rose, useful because it gave him a spine. \"Let me go inside and look. Two minutes. Less.\"\n\n\"We don\u2019t do that.\"\n\n\"I am not asking for champagne, brother.\"\n\n\"Still no.\"\n\nArif set his jaw. He considered, for a hot silly second, punching the doorman. He considered the chalk of the man\u2019s jaw and the weight of his fists. He let the thought pass like a cloud. He took the fish-shaped ice cream from his left hand\u2014the thing you forget you\u2019re holding when everything else is on fire\u2014and pushed it into the doorman\u2019s palm. The man stared at it, genuinely startled. \"Please,\" Arif said. \"I don\u2019t have time to make you a story.\"\n\nA woman\u2019s voice slid in from behind the doorman. \"What is this?\"\n\nShe was all sharp edges and silk, eyeliner making her eyes look like they had been drawn by a calligrapher. She wore a dress the color of tamarind and a smile you could cut bread with. \"I like fish,\" she said, looking at the melting ice cream in the doorman\u2019s hand. \"Who are you, sailor?\"\n\n\"Arif,\" he said. \"My cousin. She\u2019s missing.\"\n\n\"Missing from your sight or missing from the world? Because men love to claim women are missing when they are simply elsewhere.\"\n\nArif looked at the line of her mouth and chose his words carefully. \"Missing from where she said she would be. She doesn\u2019t do that. A man in a blue jacket took her. Your people wear those jackets.\"\n\n\"They do,\" she said. \"What is your cousin\u2019s name?\"\n\n\"Lila.\"\n\n\"And your name is Arif,\" she repeated, as if testing for lies tasted on the tongue. \"Are you the pie boy?\"\n\nHe blinked. \"Apparently.\"\n\n\"I watch television on mute,\" she said. \"It keeps my brain company. You look better in person. Come in for five minutes,\" she told the doorman, who shrugged very slightly like he thought this was foolish but also not his job to challenge. \"If you break anything, you pay for it.\" She took the melting fish from the doorman and licked it once, precise, like a cat. \"Delicious. Red bean. Intrepid choice.\"\n\nInside, Blue Heron was a different country. Soft light, tables like lagoons, a bar that looked like the inside of a piano. Men in indigo suits and women in dresses that moved like water and smelled like money. A jazz trio unspooled a song that made Arif want to cry for no reason he could say out loud. He scanned faces. A waitress with a tray saw him and frowned at his boots.\n\nThe woman in tamarind dress walked slightly ahead. \"I am Dara,\" she said. \"I own thirty percent of this place, which means I own the right to regret thirty percent of my decisions. Look left, not right. If you look right, someone will think you want their attention. You do not.\"\n\n\"Have you seen Lila?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have not. Why would your cousin come here?\"\n\n\"Maybe to meet someone. Maybe because this place has become the center point on some men\u2019s maps.\"\n\nDara\u2019s mouth lifted slightly at a corner. \"You read maps?\"\n\n\"I live in them.\"\n\nShe stopped near the bar and nodded at the bartender. \"Send someone to check the private rooms. A woman named Lila. Small, eyes like knives.\" She turned to Arif. \"There is someone you should meet, while we wait. Not because I think you like making friends. Because I am curious.\"\n\nShe led him to a table half in shadow where a man sat with a glass of something golden and a notebook. He looked ordinary until he looked at you, and then he didn\u2019t. His eyes were the color of the water right before it turns into storm. He smiled without showing his teeth. \"This is Bram,\" Dara said. \"He sits in corners and makes connections where none exist, which is a talent and a mental illness.\" She slid into the booth opposite him and left no room for Arif to hesitate. He slid in.\n\n\"Bram, the champion who forgot his championship,\" Dara said. \"Arif.\"\n\nBram\u2019s gaze snapped a little. \"You have stitches behind your ear,\" he said, like he was noting the weather. \"You walk like a man who favors his left knee. What did you lose?\"\n\n\"A cousin,\" Arif said. \"Lately. And other things before.\"\n\n\"Pie memory,\" Dara said, accepting a drink that appeared without being ordered. \"Your hobby has become community knowledge.\"\n\nArif put his hands on the table to keep them from fisting. \"Can your man find her or not?\"\n\nBram nodded at Dara. \"Private rooms empty.\"\n\nDara shrugged, as if to say so much for that. \"We checked the cameras outside,\" she added, a beat later, and Arif tried to decide if she said that to comfort him or to irritate him. \"This place watches itself. Nobody matching her description came in.\"\n\n\"Then she never reached this door,\" Arif said. \"Somewhere between the tent and here she went missing.\" The word felt like it belonged to someone else, but he said it again because it was correct. \"Missing.\"\n\n\"You are sure she didn\u2019t decide to take a detour with a man who does not know you exist?\" Dara asked.\n\n\"Lila likes men who say what they mean and wear un-ironed shirts. This is not her place.\" He heard the dangerous thread in his voice and gentled it. \"Please.\"\n\nDara studied him over the rim of her glass. \"Men who ask nicely are rare here.\" She set the glass down. \"Bram will help. He owes me, because last year he broke a light with his elbow. Also because I am bored.\"\n\nBram smiled slightly, his gaze on Arif\u2019s face. \"Tell me everything you noticed,\" he said. \"Start with the moment you last saw her. Every color, every trivial sound. Don\u2019t try to decide what is important. I will decide what is important.\"\n\nArif closed his eyes. He smelled lemon still, as if the scent had marked him, or he had been marked with it. He saw the ice cream vendor\u2019s fish and the woman on the phone saying I don\u2019t know and the cleaner chewing his words into thought. He described the man with the blue sleeve with the bird because the cleaner had said it, even though he, Arif, hadn\u2019t seen it with his eyes. He gave them the way the cables lay on the ground. He gave them the laughter of a girl, a laugh that wasn\u2019t Lila\u2019s. He gave them the way the wind had pushed the tent flap open, one-two, like someone calling a dog.\n\nBram listened like a priest. Dara watched the room with her eyes but her body listened. \"Blue jacket with bird,\" Bram said after a while. \"We can find that bird. It is not a common sin.\"\n\n\"You are certain it was the Blue Heron logo?\" Dara asked.\n\n\"The cleaner told me it was a bird,\" Arif said. \"He called it a blue bird. A heron is a blue bird.\"\n\n\"Many birds are blue,\" Dara said. \"But my men do wear the heron. And some of them are stupid enough to take liberties with it. If a cousin of a champion\u2019s cousin was to be taken, it would not be for ransom. It would be for a message. Or a mistake. Either makes men sloppy.\"\n\nArif turned, too quickly, and the whiskey smell whipped at his face. \"Taken,\" he repeated.\n\n\"Let us not say the worst thing loud yet,\" Dara advised. \"Let us say lost in the folds of night. For now. Bram, go look at the cameras around the park. Call Rahim. He owes us for the thing with the red scooter. Do it now.\"\n\nBram slid out of the booth with no wasted movement, already tapping messages. \"He looks like nothing,\" Dara said, watching him walk. \"That is his mask. You need to put on a better mask, Arif.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t like masks.\"\n\n\"There is your problem.\"\n\n\"One of them,\" he agreed.\n\nHe stood then because sitting had begun to feel like betrayal. \"I have to go back to the park. To see for myself. Hang up the sheets in my head and see what sticks to them.\"\n\n\"I will send someone with you,\" Dara said. \"Not to babysit. To help you ask the right kind of questions. Don\u2019t look at me like that. You don\u2019t know which questions are wrong until a wrong person hears them.\"\n\n\"I can handle wrong people.\"\n\n\"Everyone believes that until the wrong person smiles.\"\n\nHe almost smiled back at that because it was painfully true. \"Thank you,\" he said instead. He bowed his head in a way that made his grandmother\u2019s voice rise up in him with a scold about superstition and gratitude. Outside, the city pressed its ear against the wall and listened to him breathe. Inside, a trio played a song that had no patience with fear. Dara watched him with eyes that had paid for a lot of light.\n\n\"Before you go,\" she said softly, \"one question.\"\n\nHe waited.\n\n\"Do you want to win this thing again?\" Her chin tipped slightly toward the direction where the Ancol tents sat, invisible through walls but somehow loud in his head.\n\nHe realized his hands had pressed into fists on the table again. He forced the fingers to open. \"I do,\" he said, and he let himself hear what that sounded like. \"But not more than I want to find her.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she said, as if he had answered a riddle correctly. \"You are not an idiot, then. That will make your life more complicated and also longer. Go.\"\n\nHe went. The doorman gave him back his red bean fish, now half frozen again by some miracle, because the club was the sort of place where even melting could be paused. Arif looked at it and laughed, short and sharp, and bit into it. He walked back out into the night with his mouth full of sweetness and fear, the letter in his pocket, and the taste of something old at the back of his throat that might have been memory beginning to thaw. He did not run, because running makes men who watch think you are prey. But he moved fast, because not running keeps men who love you stuck in places that make no sense.\n\nHe reached the park and went around the back again. The cleaner was gone; a new one had replaced him, a girl with a scarf and a too-big broom who looked fourteen. \"Bang?\" she said when he asked. \"I saw a woman like that. She went into the side tent with a man who talked like a radio.\" She blinked. \"He had a tattoo of a feather behind his ear.\"\n\nArif\u2019s hand went to his own scar without his say-so. He felt that silly crescent like a doorbell. He thanked her and slid into the dark between two tents, like slipping between pages of a book. Inside the side tent, he found nothing but ladders and a plastic chair and the ghost of someone\u2019s perfume. He stood very still, let his breath settle, and listened. A fan, moving tired air. The brittle sleep of the city. Distant, the crash of a ride. Closer, a hum of a fridge.\n\nAnd there, inexplicably small among all the noises, a chime. A phone. One note, then two, then another. It was a ringtone he knew, silly and bell-like, because Lila refused to change it, said it made her feel like her life still had games in it. He turned toward the sound like a plant, careful not to knock anything, and it grew slightly louder to the left. He moved a stack of folded tarpaulins and there, slipped between them like a bright fish, was her phone. Screen cracked, still lighting up a notification. Blue Heron: Your reservation is confirmed. 8:30pm. Private Room A.\n\nHe stared at it too long. It chimed again and showed another message, from a number unknown. Bring what you promised. Do not be late.\n\nHe did not let himself panic. That would be as useful as shouting at the tide for wetting your shoes. He put Lila\u2019s phone in his pocket and felt it next to the letter, two rectangles warm from his touch. Then he turned and left the tent the way he had come, quiet as he could manage. Outside, the park had thinned but not gone to sleep. The ferris wheel had gone empty and then filled again with teenagers pretending not to be afraid. The smell of fried dough walked by on a man\u2019s tray. Arif breathed once, twice, and went to find Bram with the eyes like storm water and the woman with a laugh like a blade and a club named for a bird that stood in shallow water waiting to spear something.\n\nHis mouth tasted like red bean and salt. He thought of the photograph on the board, of himself with pie on his face, and could not find that man in his skin, yet. But he remembered\u2014finally, as if a small stubborn door had opened\u2014a fragment. The sound from the dream, of cheering. And the feel of a ribbon\u2019s raw edge under his thumb.\n\nIt was small, but it was something. He clung to it the way a small boat clings to a channel of calm in the strait, knowing the tide can turn hard and early, and prayed to no one that Lila was not further out than he could row.",

The man with eyes like storm water had claimed a table near the tent\u2019s perimeter and was making a small nest of receipts and cigarette papers, arranging and rearranging as if the pattern would reveal something if only he respected it enough. When Arif put Lila\u2019s phone on the tabletop, Bram did not reach for it immediately. He looked up at Arif\u2019s face, as if the state of that geography was the more telling artifact.\n\n\u201cShe left it,\u201d Arif said, and the ease with which he could tell the truth scared him more than a lie might have. \u201cIn the side tent, under tarpaulins. It was on when I found it. It\u2019s got a message.\u201d\n\nBram slid the phone to him and held it between his fingers like a playing card. He turned it so it lit his own face from below and read. \u201cReservation confirmed,\u201d he murmured. \u201cPrivate Room A. Blue Heron. And then\u2014\u2018Bring what you promised.\u2019\u201d He lifted a brow. \u201cDoes she have a habit of promising things to strangers?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe promises everything to everyone with a straight face,\u201d Arif said. \u201cAnd then she keeps the ones worth keeping. For this\u2026 she could have promised syrup, lemons, a recipe, a contact. She could have promised to sing a song so badly it breaks glass. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nDara arrived with a corona of cold air like she had brought the inside of the club with her in her hair. She sat without asking if the seat was taken and took the phone out of Bram\u2019s hand the way a teacher takes chalk. \u201cOur reservation system uses an initial code for all holds,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can look up who created this. Private Room A belongs to me. If someone has used it without asking, I will break his wrists and invoice him for the plaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not have to be your place,\u201d Arif began, but Dara was already waving at someone in the shadows and speaking into a small device hidden in her palm, her voice lowering to that silk-threat he had already recognized. Bram half smiled.\n\n\u201cShe did not want to be tracked,\u201d Bram said softly. \u201cYour cousin. She left this where it would be found by someone like you and not a man with a flashlight who looks without seeing. She knows where you look.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe also knows when to ask me to buy her ice cream like I am her servant,\u201d Arif said, and felt his mouth twist into a shape that wasn\u2019t quite a smile and wasn\u2019t quite anything else. \u201cThe cleaner saw a man with a feather tattoo behind his ear.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot my heron,\u201d Dara said, already irritated on behalf of her brand. \u201cWe do not allow our staff to be marked like cattle. They prefer to mark their souls with debt.\u201d She touched her ear as if checking for a phantom feather and shook her head. \u201cRahim has pulled the external cameras for the park. We have a view on the back gate and breakdown lane.\u201d\n\nBram put the phone back on the table and flattened a receipt beside it. \u201cBefore we leave, tell me everything else you have not told me. Quickly. It will save us an hour later and perhaps your cousin a bruise.\u201d\n\nArif spoke fast, because he could, because he had learned on boats to make your mouth as efficient as your hands when the weather changed suddenly. He gave him the vendor girl with the broom and the radio voice and the fact that the feather sat behind his ear like a secret tucked by a lover. He gave him the cleaner\u2019s boredom built into helpfulness. He spoke Lila\u2019s ringtone into the air and heard Dara make an approving noise, as if an absurd detail was a correct coin placed on the correct counter.\n\nDara stood, impatient with chairs. \u201cWe can do more from a screen than from a table,\u201d she declared. \u201cCome.\u201d\n\nThey moved like a small river cutting through a bigger one, making their own channel through the back of the tent, past men in headsets with that grim look of people who make community out of noise, past a mountain of paper plates and a woman who hid a yawn behind a ladle. In a corner where the tent wall folded into itself, a young man hunched over a laptop with cables sprouting from it like vines. He glanced up when Dara\u2019s shadow fell on his keyboard and visibly straightened his spine.\n\n\u201cBack gate, twenty minutes back,\u201d Dara said. \u201cAnd the vendor paths. And the service road. Give me everything you can pull that won\u2019t feed anyone else\u2019s curiosity before mine.\u201d\n\nThe screen offered a black-and-white world before it offered anything else. Arif was briefly furious that the night had been reduced to flat gray and the shapes of people turned to figures without faces. Then one of the figures was unmistakable, head forward, the little seesaw of her arms when she was moving quickly without wanting to run. Lila slipped along the edge of the tent, paused, looked back as if she had left a seasoning behind and needed to remember it. A man came into the frame a second later, jacket dark, with a cut that suggested money and patience. He did not touch her. He gestured with two fingers, like a conductor inviting a quiet instrument in.\n\n\u201cThat is one of ours,\u201d Satria said, appearing at Arif\u2019s elbow as if conjured by his own guilt. He had approached on soft feet with a cup of coffee that smelled like it had been waiting too long for a mouth. \u201cThe jacket. Owner\u2019s sponsor team gave two to their activation boys. I told them the brand rules, but you know sponsors. They want to be seen without being seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNames,\u201d Dara said, without turning her head.\n\n\u201cJonas,\u201d Satria said immediately. \u201cAnd maybe Tomo. I don\u2019t know the second. Jonas is a contractor. He knows everything about everything but only after it has already happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes Jonas have a feather behind his ear?\u201d Bram asked.\n\nSatria had the grace to look like a boy in a classroom who had been asked about the poem he didn\u2019t read. \u201cI don\u2019t look at boys\u2019 ears,\u201d he said weakly, then grimaced when Dara\u2019s mouth simply went thinner. \u201cMaybe he does. He\u2019s with\u2014sometimes he works with Tawa Promotions. They do clubs. They did Blue Heron\u2019s opening party. He has a\u2026 tall girlfriend. An actress.\u201d\n\nOn the screen, Lila and the man with the expensive patience slipped out of the camera\u2019s view. The feed switched to the service road, where a golf cart with the words \u201cMariana\u201d stenciled on its side in a script that wanted to be elegant and wasn\u2019t swung into view. The driver wore a cap low. The man in the jacket got in beside him. Lila got in the back like someone who resented the fact of transport. The cart pulled away and out of frame.\n\n\u201cMariana,\u201d Arif said. \u201cLike the tent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tent,\u201d Satria said. \u201cThe caterer. They run food to the sponsor lounge and move chairs when chairs need moving. That cart is theirs.\u201d\n\nDara\u2019s phone breathed against her palm. She lifted it and read and for once did not narrate to make a point. \u201cThe reservation was made by a code belonging to an external vendor,\u201d she said after a beat. \u201cSomebody who, for tonight, belongs to us and tomorrow belongs to someone else. They put it under a generic name and figured our systems would simply accept the shape of a request because the right letterheads were sniffing around. They were not wrong. Private Room A did not open. But the promise was made by someone who believed it would.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere does Mariana store their chairs when chairs are sleeping?\u201d Bram asked Satria, who blinked and looked like he would rather swallow his radio than answer.\n\n\u201cThey have a yard near the northern fence,\u201d Satria said, then tried to qualify it. \u201cIt\u2019s where all the vendors put their skeletons. There\u2019s a gate to the service canal.\u201d\n\nArif tasted lemon again without putting anything in his mouth. \u201cThe canal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you wanted to take something or someone away from a maze with two thousand eyes, you would do it where the fishes keep their counsel.\u201d\n\nDara gave him a look that said perhaps he would have been a poet if he had a different grandmother. \u201cGo,\u201d she said. \u201cBram, take two of our boys and your brain. Satria, you are not invited. Every time you speak tonight, something foolish leaves your mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Satria said, then closed his mouth because for once he had chosen the correct thing to do with it.\n\nThey moved again, Bram texting with both hands while walking, Arif pacing him with an itch in the soles of his feet that would not be calmed by any rhythm but forward. Dara\u2019s men materialized out of shadows, as if her will grew staff. One was broad in the chest with a nose that had been broken and reset with evident care, the other narrow and fox-like around the eyes, each of them wearing the kind of shirt that looked like nothing until you tried to pull it off and realized it was expensive. They did not speak to Arif except with their attentive silence, which was fine with him; words sometimes made the ground crumble.\n\nThe vendor yard was not a place built for poetry. It was a rectangle of concrete and bad lighting, chain-link fence topped with coils that had known better days and dull knives at their edges. Metal racks held plastic chairs stacked to the height of a small house. Water pooled in the low places and reflected the light in mean little coins. There was a smell of stale oil and something sweeter underneath, like candy left in a car. From the far side of the yard came the chuckle of a small engine and the sound of someone swearing at something that would not fit into something else.\n\nThe gate had a padlock that wanted to look fierce. It sat in its hasp like a fat dog. Bram looked at it, looked at Dara\u2019s broad-shouldered man, and the man said, \u201cGive me thirty seconds,\u201d like a promise rather than a guess. He produced something from his back pocket that looked like a hairpin and something else that looked like a secret and the padlock opened with the kind of sigh people make when they realize they have been out-argued. They slipped in, let the gate kiss closed behind them, and divided without needing to agree first.\n\nArif moved along the edge where the fence met a line of tarps and cases, every sense opening like valves. He saw a piece of scarf snagged on a rough edge of shelf metal, gray, the weave familiar. He did not touch it immediately. He crouched and let his eyes widen and adjust, because he had learned on boats that sometimes the thing you think you see is only the reflection of a thing that isn\u2019t there. Then he reached and took the thread between his fingers, and the itch in his feet moved up, settled behind his eyes.\n\nBeyond the racks, a low building sat with its back turned to the yard. The door was dented near the bottom, where someone had kicked it often for reasons that had nothing to do with cruelty and everything to do with hurry. The air that breathed from the gap between door and frame was colder than the air outside. Bram arrived at Arif\u2019s shoulder and put his palm against the metal. He didn\u2019t push. He listened. There is a way metal talks to you when you know how to ask. He looked at Arif and nodded and then put his weight in the right angle and the door opened.\n\nInside it was fridges and the thin hum of machines who felt they were performing an important duty. A strip of light jittered at the ceiling from a fluorescent that was considering retirement. Boxes labeled with handwriting sat on the floor. Citrus bar, someone had scrawled, as if afraid they would forget what lemons were. The lettering made Arif\u2019s jaw twitch. He had seen that hand write orders to a delivery guy who always complained about the weight of ice and the cost of gas.\n\nHe went to his knees and ran his palm over the tops of the boxes as if he could feel who had carried them. He found one that had tape over tape, a patchwork like a field seen from the air. There was a line of ribbon taped to it, a blue strip with the contest logo quartered across it in white, cut in half by the tear. He touched the edge of it and the movement of his thumb across the raw fabric was the shape of his dream, and his stomach turned. The taste at the back of his throat was not lemon or fear but something bitter he couldn\u2019t name.\n\nBram took a box cutter from a shelf as if it had always meant to end up in his hand and slit the tape with the kind of care a surgeon gives to skin. He opened the box and found bottles nested like birds, each tucked in newspaper to keep it safe from its neighbors. The caps were plastic but sealed with care. He lifted one out and sniffed it, then offered it to Arif.\n\nArif did not drink in the way some men did, but he could taste a thing and know its weather. He wetted one finger, touched it to his tongue, and waited. Lemon. Sugar. Salt. Then something too sharp, a high note that did not belong to Lila\u2019s recipe, like laughter in a place where laughter had no business. He frowned and tried again in case the first taste was a lie. It wasn\u2019t. The bitterness was shy but definite, the taste of medicine and a field at noon.\n\n\u201cQuinine,\u201d Bram said, as if reading his mind, and shrugged. \u201cSome bars cheat the bitterness into their drinks. It makes their gins seem more ginful.\u201d\n\n\u201cLila doesn\u2019t cheat,\u201d Arif said, more sharply than any tonic should earn. \u201cIf she wants bitterness she uses peel. If she wants question marks she uses cloves.\u201d He held the bottle up to the jittering light and watched the syrup throw back an oily sheen. \u201cThis is not her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich means someone changed it,\u201d Bram said. \u201cOr someone asked her to make it this way and she rolled her eyes and did it because money makes new recipes.\u201d\n\nArif ran his thumb along the bottle cap until the plastic bit at his skin. \u201cOr someone took what she made and added something to it because their plan is not our plan.\u201d\n\nBram smiled with one side of his mouth in a way that suggested it wasn\u2019t a smile as much as acknowledgment of a shape in the fog. \u201cAnd what plan would that be?\u201d\n\nArif looked at the ribbon again because he couldn\u2019t not. \u201cTomorrow there will be a tent full of people with their mouths open,\u201d he said. \u201cAn after-party with glasses lifted. Cameras. A sponsor who wants a story. A club that wants to be more famous than it is. If you wanted to lace something through a city, you could do worse than a party where everyone asks for the same drink.\u201d\n\nBram was nodding when the sharp-faced man by the door lifted his hand, which meant silence and the presence of a thing that made noise even when it wanted to be quiet. Footsteps outside, two pairs, then three. A scrape that could have been a boot against concrete or a box being made to pretend it weighed less than it did. The men moved without speaking, and you could hear when silence had a different owner. The broad man slid toward the door with something heavy behind his back. Bram reached for the light and pulled it off, and the room shrank into the kind of dark that makes you think you have grown new ears.\n\nThe door opened a crack and the light from the yard entered like a person. Two shapes came in with it. One spoke in a whisper that wanted to be a shout. \u201cWhere are the A\u2019s?\u201d he said. \u201cHe told me A\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d the second shape said, and the whisper had a radio in it. \u201cHere. The tape. A. Put it on the boat. He wants it at Kota before two. Don\u2019t look.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at what?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt anything you will then describe to a police officer.\u201d\n\nArif felt his heart walk to the end of its leash and stop. He did not move. He breathed. He knew this dance. You made your body become rope, and rope did not exist until it needed to.\n\nThe man with the radio moved deeper. You could tell he was sure of his night and the fact that it belonged to him. He bent, his head coming under the stingy light slanting in from the door, and Arif saw, clearly as if someone had drawn it with a good pen, a feather behind his ear. Not a heron\u2019s plume, which would have been too long, but something short, stylized, like a hint rather than a biography. It was inked in dark blue. It looked like a laugh he would not understand.\n\nBram let his breath out through his teeth and stepped forward out of the dark as if he had decided the time for hiding and stealing things unseen had passed. He lifted his hands to the height of his shoulders, palms empty because sometimes emptiness was a more comforting thing to hand someone than a weapon. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said, in a voice that had the weight of many better rooms behind it. \u201cWrong shelf.\u201d\n\nThe man with the radio turned very slowly, as if he had learned long ago that the way you move when surprised can make a puppet of your fate. His eyes went wide and then flat. His hand dropped to something at his hip. Bram did not flinch. The broad man at the door did what broad men do and made his own shadow bigger than it was by standing exactly so. The fox-eyed man flowed left and became a suggestion near the fridges.\n\nArif was aware of how warm the bottle in his hand had become and how foolish it was to be holding a bottle when this was the kind of conversation that should be conducted by men holding a different vocabulary. He set the bottle down, because he had not yet made all the mistakes he was going to make tonight and it seemed courteous to leave some for the end.\n\n\u201cWe just need to borrow the owner of that phone,\u201d Bram said, nodding toward Lila\u2019s device on the shelf, which was a lie of geography and therefore an interesting new shape. \u201cYou take your boxes to your boat. We will take our person to our tent. Everyone goes to bed with their teeth inside their mouths.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not police,\u201d the radio voice said. He said it as a fact and as a contempt. \u201cWhich means you are prey that forgot its place.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrey tastes bad when it\u2019s angry,\u201d Dara said from the doorway, and Arif had never been so pleased in his life to hear a voice that was not his. She stood with her hands in the pockets of her dress like a woman leaning on a balcony looking down at poor choices. She had brought one more man, who had brought a gun but held it like a violin. \u201cThe reservation was mine,\u201d she added, not because it mattered but because it was fun to say the truth so hard it made strangers blink.\n\nThe feather-ear\u2019s mouth did a small thing and then stopped doing it. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the A cases,\u201d he said, because names were anchors and he was trying to steady his boat. \u201cThe rest is for the contest. The sponsor pays for after a party. You do not need to know more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always need to know more,\u201d Dara said dryly. \u201cIt\u2019s why I have fewer friends than enemies and better shoes than either.\u201d\n\nArif stepped forward then because the thing he needed to say would become poison if he held it any longer. \u201cWhere is Lila?\u201d He did not dress the word cousin around her name. His voice put that dress on her without trying. \u201cShe came with you. You do not leave women outside the door like shoes.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, the man looked at him. He looked and then looked at the ribbon, at Arif\u2019s hand, at the place behind Arif\u2019s ear where the thin crescent of scar lived under hair. He grinned briefly and without joy. \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cThe boy who eats pie like a machine. Ferry television. People in my kampung cheered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you liked the show, you should leave the actor his mouth,\u201d Dara murmured. She had a talent for sounding bored when she wanted to scare someone. \u201cYou have one minute to say the name of the place where you left the girl behind, or I will count how many bones your wrist has when it is working and again when it is not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he is the kind of man who answers questions because a woman with jewelry asks nicely?\u201d the other man scoffed, which turned out to be his mistake. The broad-shouldered man moved a fraction and the scoffer\u2019s shoulder found the door hard and in the wrong place. He made a noise like someone had taken an elegant idea out of his head and replaced it with a bird.\n\n\u201cMarina C,\u201d the feather-ear said, and he looked like a man who had not meant to say anything yet had found language in his mouth suddenly heavy. \u201cThe old fish freezer near the canal. We brought her to talk and she talked like a knife. We left her with the freezer to cool off. The boss will bring her to the club when the time is right. That is not your worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe time is not right?\u201d Bram said gently. \u201cShe will be cold and you will be fired.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not alone,\u201d the man said, too quickly now, improvising or sabotaging himself; Arif could not tell which and did not care. \u201cThere is a boy watching her. He eats candy like his mother hasn\u2019t taught him how to finish a meal. He has a feather on his neck. He\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more,\u201d Dara said, and the man closed his mouth as if it were a trap closing on the tail of a rat. She nodded once to her men, and they did something with their bodies that did not look like violence until you were paying attention. The men with the radio and the wrong brace of courage found themselves disarmed not of weapons but of their confidence. It was almost elegant.\n\nArif took one of the A-marked boxes and set it aside, a childish pettiness he did not intend until it was done. The tape bit his palm. He wanted to open every box in the room and pour them into the drain. He wanted to smash every bottle and taste each shard to see if his tongue could pick up lies as quickly as it picked up lemon. He wanted too many things. He took the ribbon instead, the little strip like a blue river cut off from its source, and put it in his pocket with Lila\u2019s phone, and then something in him settled enough to be useful.\n\n\u201cWe go now,\u201d he said, but he did not say it like a command; he said it like a boatman at the bow saying the tide had turned and if you did not lift anchor now your anchors would lift you. He looked at Bram, who was nodding, and he looked at Dara, who was already turning away, bored with men on the wrong shelf and interested in men who had built a freezer near a canal out of fish and cement and arithmetic.\n\nThe path from the yard to the service canal stank of old ambition. The water lay black and knowing under the low overpass, and a rat paused in the glow of an emergency light to consider them with a seriousness that made Arif want to bow. The freezer building sat like a shrug at the water\u2019s edge. Its windows were either bricked or ignored. A single light burned behind a frosted pane, and the light looked tired of itself. You could hear a generator purr like a cat that had learned to believe its own lies.\n\nDara\u2019s violin man took the lead. He did not posture with his weapon because only men who are playacting make that sort of theater. He put his back to the wall where the door would open inward and mouthed numbers that made his colleagues\u2019 shoulders shift at the correct syllables. Bram\u2019s voice brushed Arif\u2019s ear, lower than breath. \u201cIf you go first, it will be your last first,\u201d he said. \u201cStay on my shoulder. You will still get to be brave. You can be brave with your mouth, later.\u201d\n\nArif nodded because he trusted a man who kept his own bones inside his skin. He flexed his fingers once and thought of the way ropes bite when wet and what it means to give a thing a little slack so it does not bite itself harder. He thought of Lila\u2019s wrists with the temporary henna peeling at the edges, that sticky sugar under his fingers. He thought of the boy with candy, the feather like a comma on his neck, and made a quiet, vicious promise to every god he did not believe in that the boy would go home to be scolded about dental bills and not be a dot in a story he could not end.\n\nThe door opened as if it had been told to by someone it feared. The smell of cold came out\u2014dry and mean, a winter in a city that had none. Inside, the light made a crop of metal tables look like a field of ice. At the second table closest to the back wall, a figure curled in a chair, her feet bare and one ankle folded too long in a way that told Arif she had been trying to make a rope with her body and had only managed to tire her joints. Lila\u2019s head was bent to one side like she was listening to a secret in the wall. Her hands were bound with something red that looked almost pretty in bad light.\n\nA boy sat on a crate nearby, swinging one leg and reading something on his phone with a concentration that made Arif weirdly proud of youth. He had a paper-wrapped candy between his teeth. The feather ink on his neck was small and absurd and very new, the skin around it still irritated. He glanced up when the door breathed, began to stand, and then did not because Dara\u2019s man had placed a barrel of opinion where it would persuade him to keep his thighs on the crate and his mouth shut.\n\nBram reached Lila first because Arif felt the floor tilt and he could not find his feet for one hot heartbeat. The rope around her wrists had cut her skin a little. Bram made the knot understand that it no longer had a job. He touched Lila\u2019s cheek with one knuckle and she lifted her head as if someone had pulled a thread from the ceiling and attached it to her hairline. Her eyes were wide and then narrowed because that was her shape when the world came back and needed to be scolded.\n\n\u201cYou took your time,\u201d she said. Her voice was rough and made of sand, and it was the most beautiful noise Arif had heard since the first time his grandfather started an engine that had cost a month of prayers. \u201cI am freezing and my right leg is angry and I will never forgive whoever chose that boy as a guard because he pees and does not wash his hands.\u201d\n\nArif laughed in one breath and almost cried in the next because his body had too many rooms and not enough furniture for all the feelings to sit at once. He went to her and put his hands on her face and then snatched them back because he realized he was standing where men with opinions stood when they thought they owned women. He put them on the back of the chair instead, which felt like a compromise between honor and panic. \u201cYou left your phone like a breadcrumb,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a clever bird.\u201d\n\n\u201cI left my phone like a debt,\u201d she said, and then winced when blood returned to her fingers and made it known. \u201cDid you bring me a jacket? No? You are a bad bird.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like an apology,\u201d Dara inquired, and it was the closest she had come to gentleness all night. \u201cI only have one, and I am saving it for your cousin when he does something stupid tomorrow on television.\u201d\n\nLila\u2019s mouth tilted. \u201cI like you,\u201d she said, as if this was a thing she could give and take back like money. \u201cWho are you? No, don\u2019t tell me. Tell me later. Tell me when I am wrapped in something that feels like a dragon.\u201d\n\nBram cut the rope at her ankles and stood with her hand in the air until he was sure it was a hand and not a feathered wheel about to spin off its axis. The boy on the crate made a small sound like the beginning of a protest and then swallowed it when Dara turned her head and let him see the future he would not enjoy if he made the sound any bigger. He was younger than his tattoo and his arrogance. He was too young for the room he had been put in.\n\n\u201cWater,\u201d Arif said to no one and everyone, and the fox-eyed man produced a bottle that was probably meant for a different problem and which nevertheless solved this one. Lila drank and made a face at the taste and drank again. She looked up at the boy and stuck out her tongue. \u201cI told your boss I don\u2019t keep my recipes in bottles,\u201d she said conversationally. \u201cMen always think women\u2019s work lives inside jars. My recipes live in my head. It is bigger than his jar.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should have just brought what you promised,\u201d the boy said, and Arif heard the radio in his mouth and decided it sat there because someone else\u2019s speech had taken up residence and this boy didn\u2019t yet have enough words of his own to push it out. \u201cThen you could have gone home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did bring it,\u201d Lila said, and lifted her bound hands as if they were a platter. \u201cYou touched it. We all touched it. It was already dirty before you grabbed it. Tell your boss I washed my lemons with holy water and his plan will burn.\u201d\n\nThe boy blinked, which was the right kind of confusion to carry home to a boss who liked to think he had vacuumed all superstition out of his men with money. Bram had Lila standing now, gently. Her weight settled into one hip and she drew her shoulders up as if warming herself from the inside.\n\n\u201cArif,\u201d she said, and he tried not to be the kind of man who goes soft and childish when his name is said in that particular way by a person who has just been returned to him. \u201cHe asked for my syrup. A special blend. He wanted the bitter. He said people like premium tastes. He said\u2014\u201d she stopped, thinking, rewinding, like she was lifting lines from a net carefully so none of them cut her palms. \u201cHe said if it wins, everybody will want it. He did not think I noticed he changed my bottle for another. So I left my phone and my pride and went to follow the wrong bottle. Then a boy with a feather put me here and told me not to move. He has bad teeth. I told him to floss.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are too brave,\u201d Arif said, and she made a noise that was not a laugh so much as a small storm.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI am angry. It is different. Brave makes people monuments before the day is over. Angry gets to eat breakfast.\u201d\n\nDara made a pleased sound that signaled she had approved a menu. \u201cWe will take the A boxes,\u201d she said to Bram. \u201cWe will make sure the after-party drinks do not make our guests recite poems at the moon or see God. We will give the sponsor a lesson in what the word \u2018ownership\u2019 means. Then we will give the boy with the feather a toothbrush and a job with someone who will make sure he remembers to use it. Then we will crush the gentleman with the radio voice gently between two board meetings until he makes a neat noise. Everyone will learn something tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Bram said mildly, \u201cthere is a contest. Our champion has to earn his photograph again.\u201d\n\nArif felt all the air in the room turn toward that sentence like grass leaning toward wind. His body, like an engine he had let idle too long, coughed and caught. The ribbon in his pocket scratched his skin where it lay, and the small remembered feel of a ribbon\u2019s edge bookended the sharp newness of rope on wrists and a knot pulled loose. He looked at Lila and said the thing he had not, until this second, been able to afford to say in his own head: \u201cI want to win for the same reason I want to hurt them,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cTo take back a piece of my mouth.\u201d\n\nLila tilted her chin. Her eyes were still those narrow slits of a person who did not give the night the dignity of being impressed by it. \u201cThen eat their money,\u201d she said. \u201cEat it in front of everybody. Make them clap for you because they have forgotten what else they came for. Make them pay for forgetting.\u201d\n\nThe boy with the candy watched them like he was looking at a species of adults who do not live in his neighborhood. He opened his mouth. \u201cCan I\u2026 go?\u201d he asked to no one and everyone, and Dara considered him like a puzzle she might not be bored by.\n\n\u201cYou can go home,\u201d she said finally. \u201cYou can tell your mother that you tried to watch a woman and she watched you back and you failed. Then you can decide who you want to be next.\u201d She nodded at the door. \u201cRun. Do not join a bigger fish unless you learn how to be a river first.\u201d\n\nHe ran, because boys run even when told to walk. He slammed his shoulder into the frame and did not say sorry and did not look back because he had correctly calculated that looking back would make his future worse in the short term. Bram exhaled once and gathered up a box like he had been born lifting weight with calculation. The broad-shouldered man took two. The fox-eyed man did a thing with tape that made it look like it had never been touched.\n\nThey left the freezer as if it had decided it did not want them in it anyway. The canal breathed damp and the city farther back was a low shout. Arif helped Lila into the golf cart that had appeared like a magic trick with the Mariana script on it, and for a second the absurdity of the letters made him want to kiss someone for how stupid the world was sometimes and how it nevertheless manufactured grace.\n\nAs they bumped along by the water, Lila leaned against him for the first time since they were children and the ferry had jumped a wake and he had reached, unthinking, and made a net with his arms. He felt her ribs and he felt, beneath the ribs, anger cooling to something useful. \u201cYou look like you slept on a deck,\u201d she murmured, finding a smile in her mouth despite all its injuries. \u201cYou smell like red bean and trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey gave your phone a table at Blue Heron,\u201d he said. \u201cYour fame grows.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy phone is more interesting than me,\u201d she said, and for the first time all night her laughter came untangled from the fear that had been living in its threads. \u201cTomorrow, the boy eats pies. Tonight, we go home and I put my feet in a bowl of hot water and swear at the ceiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd after that?\u201d he asked, because he could not help himself, because this was his fault and not his fault, because he had a talent for making letters into charms.\n\n\u201cAfter that,\u201d she said, \u201cyou find the edge of your ribbon and pull. We see what comes loose. And we make lemonade for three thousand people because Satria promised and I will make him pay for that promise with his pride.\u201d\n\nThey were near the tent again, the lights making a field that made strangers into friends for the price of an hour. Dara slid off the cart as if it had been beneath her to sit at all and adjusted her dress like a flag. She looked at Arif and then at Lila. \u201cI do not like saints,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I like you. Try not to make me regret it by doing something noble and stupid tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow I will do something hungry and efficient,\u201d Arif said. \u201cNoble and stupid I am saving for next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cBring me a slice of whoever you beat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t slice people,\u201d Lila said, affronted on behalf of the concept. \u201cWe slice pies.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame language,\u201d Dara countered, and then she was gone into the light with men drifting behind her like punctuation marks, the night rearranging itself around the absence of her voice.\n\nBram touched Arif\u2019s arm, and Arif did not pull away because some men\u2019s touch did not move you closer to a cliff. \u201cThree hours of sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we will meet the baker with the laugh who thinks her husband is dough. You will put your mouth to work on something that will not bite back.\u201d\n\n\u201cBu Dewi,\u201d Arif said, and let the name sit on his tongue like sugar. \u201cDurian tart that smells like socks only in memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Bram said. \u201cAlways start the day with an enemy you can eat.\u201d\n\nThey split at the vendor gate, the men with the boxes going in a direction that would make other men think twice before following, Lila leaning more of her weight into Arif because she had decided he deserved the load by now. The Laut Liris slept at the quay, listening with her tilted mast. The city blinked at them with her hundred eyes and kept her council. Arif felt the ribbon in his pocket and smelled lemon in the creases of Lila\u2019s hair and made a promise to the night, to the water, to the old scar behind his ear, to the piece of himself he could almost remember being attached to a garland made of pastry leaves. He promised to pull until something broke and he kept that promise as both a bowline and a prayer.",

                              "content": "Morning came with a bruised yellow light that made the hull ribs glow like old bones, and Arif woke at the exact moment the Liris shifted under him as if she had been waiting to be polite. His tongue carried the ghost of red bean and cold, which would have been pleasant if his jaw didn\u2019t feel like it had been asked to clench for an hour while keeping an oath. He lay for a breath and counted the noises that meant the world had survived the night\u2014the mutter of harbor voices, the rope tender\u2019s cough, the clatter of a bucket on someone\u2019s deck because it had slipped and then been lied about. When he swung his feet down, the floor was cool enough to make his ankle bones complain, and the letter in his pocket found the shape of his thigh without him telling it how. He touched the crease where it was nearly torn and let his breath out through his teeth because there was a day to be had and pretending it wasn\u2019t coming was a luxury people with fewer debts could afford.\n\nLila had curled herself into the corner bench in the Liris\u2019s tiny galley, a blanket over her shoulders and her hair loose in a way that made her look younger and more dangerous. The rope burns looked like bracelets a child had drawn around her wrists with a broken crayon. She had put a pot of water to heat and fallen asleep with a spoon in her hand as if she had been caught mid-negotiation. Arif stood and watched her for a minute the way a man stands over any treasure you could lose stupidly. He took the spoon gently and set it on the table, and when the water had reached the polite sound of first bubbles, he poured it into a bowl and added salt until it looked like a little sea. He slid the bowl under the table to sit, made tea with whatever leaves had been left in the bottom of the tin, and waited for Lila to wake so he could be smug about having guessed the exact moment her foot would want heat and salt.\n\n\u201cYou hover like an aunt,\u201d she said without opening her eyes, which was either evidence of true cousinhood or witchcraft. She pushed the blanket down with her shoulder and the night let go of her in stages, like some old polite animal not ready to leave. \u201cDo not tell me we are late. I will cut time into pieces if it tries that trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are on time for nothing,\u201d he said, which made her smile because it was true. He put her foot into the bowl and watched her make the face she made when pleasure surprised her and she resented it. He wanted to say the thing he had chosen to save for light about fear being a stupid dog that ate anything you left on the table, even if it was a phone under a tarp. He wanted to say the thing about not leaving her alone again even if she told him to go play at being a hero and leave management to adults. He said neither, because promises made in kitchens have to be the kind you can keep without a rhythm section behind them.\n\nPak Kacek appeared on deck like a bad fortune rendered lovingly. He looked in at them through the hatch and shook his head like a rooster who had decided the morning had been arranged improperly. \u201cYour face says you fought ghosts,\u201d he announced, which in his mouth came out as approval. \u201cI brought breakfast. My wife made soto because she thinks soup solves reputations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wife is correct,\u201d Lila said, lifting her foot and tapping it dry on the blanket as if she could insult physics into behaving better. \u201cGive it here. I will swallow it without argument.\u201d\n\nThey sat with the bowls on the table and ate like people who knew what hunger for anything does when you feed it with the wrong thing. The broth had the exact right trick of heat, and Arif felt it go somewhere useful. Pak Kacek watched them both over his spoon, taking in the sugar-burns, the bruised places, the letter in Arif\u2019s pocket that had worn a map into his clothes. \u201cWe will fix the pump at ten,\u201d he declared, because men like him admired schedules almost as much as they ignored them. \u201cBefore that we visit the woman who thinks she married yeast. She called at dawn to say her laugh woke two pigeons and a baker and she blamed you for both.\u201d\n\n\u201cBu Dewi,\u201d Lila said, and licked her spoon with violent neatness. \u201cWe said we would go. I\u2019m not cancelling on the only person who thinks a durian should be taught manners.\u201d\n\nThey were out into the quay air an hour later, which meant nearly two, because Lila had insisted on changing her scarf three times and Arif had realized he had slept in a shirt that had acquired a fish scale pattern by accident. The city had put on its daytime costume, traffic like a migration done wrong, men and women drawing their days behind them like nets catching half-useful things. A man on the pier had chalked a neat blue feather near the bollards and Arif saw it and let his eyes pass over it as if it were not anything. Later, he told himself, because anger you pick up too early in a day drops under your feet when you least need it.\n\nBu Dewi\u2019s bakery lived behind a shutter painted with strawberries that had never seen strawberries and under a sign that said \u201cTart & Manis\u201d in a font that had been excited twenty years ago and had tired since. It had a smell that settled over your head like a hat you would not be embarrassed to be photographed in. She had a flour handprint on her apron in the shape of a country and even more flour in her laugh. She pulled them inside like a tide and made a show of looking at Lila\u2019s wrists and clucking like a hen who knew the value of scolding someone you were going to feed.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t die,\u201d she announced. \u201cVery good. I am a selfish woman. If you die, I have nobody to gossip with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not gossip,\u201d Lila said with indignation that came out as affection. \u201cI am news.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter,\u201d Bu Dewi said. \u201cNews you can eat.\u201d She ran the back of her hand along Arif\u2019s jaw the way aunties test the quality of fruit. \u201cYou look like a boy who wrestled a rumor and lost. Sit. I made the durian do as it was told.\u201d\n\nThe tart was a miracle of two kinds of obedience. The crust held when it should and submitted when that was wiser. The filling announced itself like a traveler with good stories and one too many shirts in his bag, and yet somehow did not knock any chairs over. Arif took a bite and the exact arrangement of sweetness and something almost rotten but not quite made his nose itch the way strong memory does. For a second the bakery was a white tent and the air was full of breath and ribbon string, and he heard his own laugh from last year, the one Lila had described to him and he had not believed because he did not think he owned that sound. He took another bite and felt the shape of the bite fit into a groove as if his mouth had been saving it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re there,\u201d Bu Dewi said, as if he had let out a small light from behind his teeth and she had seen it. \u201cYou went somewhere and came back with a better face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember a corner,\u201d he said, and did not hide his surprise because hiding is for later. \u201cNot everything. But a corner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe corners are where the spiders live,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cThey make the web strong. It is enough, for now.\u201d She set another tart down, this one apple with thin slices arranged like gills. \u201cIf you want your mouth to do its old tricks, you must ask your hands to make the right shapes. Practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not practice eating like a pig,\u201d Lila sniffed, already reaching for a knife. \u201cI practice breathing while watching men eat like pigs, which is more noble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour nobility can sit,\u201d Bu Dewi said, swatting at the air. \u201cThe boy needs water. The boy needs rhythm. I will show you the water. He knows the rhythm already. Even when men forget, their bodies keep at least one song.\u201d\n\nShe had never competed, she said, because showing your mouth to a crowd was for people with more stubborn vanity than she could afford. But she had watched three years of contestants and learned what they knew whether or not they wanted to know it. She had arranged pitchers at three temperatures, one with ice swimming like penguins, one at room-warm, and one as hot as a confession. \u201cMen think cold keeps the throat alive,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is correct until the cold makes the throat a stone. Then the stone sits and tells you secrets you don\u2019t have time to write down. Try warm. Try hot. See which lies less.\u201d\n\nArif dunked crust into warm and felt it surrender without turning to paste. Hot lit his chest like shame and made his tongue a stranger. Cold was a promise his hands couldn\u2019t keep for long. He found himself moving in a cadence that was half-work song, half prayer, and realized somewhere under his sternum something had clicked in and said yes, you have done this, badly and then better, and then well enough to put a blue ribbon on your throat and call it a garland. Lila counted under her breath, not numbers but names\u2014\u201cAyam, ikan, ular,\u201d as if counting animals was less likely to break anything important in the air.\n\nBy the third tart he had discovered where to place his breath so it did not insult his swallow. By the fifth he knew the exact point when strawberry glaze becomes an enemy and where to put his eyes so they did not dive into the crowd and drown. He did not remember himself laughing with sugar on his chin last year, but he remembered now how not to hate the feeling of hands clapping because they did not know what else to do when faced with hunger organized into a show. He let himself be grateful for that thin trick of knowing, and when he caught Lila\u2019s gaze sliding over his face with that same carefulness she used to test a syrup, he lifted his chin a fraction to tell her he had found the beat.\n\n\u201cDo not forget to stop before stopping stops you,\u201d Bu Dewi said, and folded his sticky fingers into his palm for him like he was a boy with sugar and a pocket and poor ideas. \u201cPeople think winning is like a ride at the fair. They do not see the part where it takes your legs away when nobody is looking.\u201d\n\nHe sat on the little stool she gave him and let the sugar tremor pass through. Lila poured him tea because she was the only person allowed to pour anything into him without him being allowed to argue. He looked at the scratch on her wrist and watched her flex the hand as if she was telling the skin it owed her a better performance tomorrow. \u201cHe wanted my bitter,\u201d she said to the steam because the steam did not react. \u201cThe boy with a radio burns for a boss who walks around with a mirror in his pocket and calls it God. They wanted me to help them. They do not know you cannot make a woman like me helpful without paying in a currency I like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like stories,\u201d Bu Dewi said. \u201cYou will take theirs and spend it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will turn it into a recipe I do not share,\u201d Lila agreed, and blew on her tea with a ferocity that made the steam choose to leave faster.\n\nThe front shutter rattled and a head popped under it, trailing a camera and a smell of perfume that had ambitions. A girl with too much energy and too little shame stuck her face into the bakery and said Arif\u2019s name like it was a gossip column. Behind her, a boy with a shoulder rig filmed the strawberries and the sugar and the morning indignation. \u201cChampion,\u201d she sang. \u201cIs it true? Were you kidnapped? Are you saving Jakarta with your mouth? Our subscribers love a narrative with civic responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe love privacy with knives,\u201d Lila said flatly, which translated into any language as Not Today. The girl made a regretful face that meant she had learned to make regret look like a service. She pointed her microphone at Arif\u2019s mouth anyway, because a mouth is a mouth whether it is chewing or speaking. \u201cWe can do footage of you training,\u201d she suggested. \u201cInspirational. Sweat. Men love seeing men sweat. Women too.\u201d\n\nArif looked at Bu Dewi, who gave the smallest possible shake of her head, and he decided he had earned the right to receive advice. He smiled at the camera boy the way you smile at someone who is doing a job their mother will never understand. \u201cToday I am training to drink tea without spilling it,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow you can film my sweat and sell it for money. Today is my grandmother\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe girl laughed too loud, because that is how you laugh when you have to sell laughter to an audience that can click away. She was about to push again when a shadow in the doorway made her change her math. Satria leaned against the shutter with an expression that said he had swallowed his pride and it had given him indigestion. He looked at the camera and then at Lila\u2019s face and made the correct decision for once in a day to lower his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re securing the sponsor lounge,\u201d he said without preamble. \u201cAnd the after-party. There will be no \u2018A\u2019 boxes anywhere anyone\u2019s mother can see. I am not a person who enjoys being told I have failed. Please stop being a person who gives me new failures.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did your work for you,\u201d Lila said, and tilted her head so the light caught the ugly neatness of the rope burns. \u201cSend an invoice to your conscience.\u201d\n\nSatria\u2019s shoulders slumped in a way that made him look shorter and younger. \u201cI know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cGerry is weeping into his jacket because Dara shouted at him until his hair lost its product. I have to stand between men who think the word \u2018activation\u2019 can fix everything and a woman who can have me barred from every club north of the old city. If you want to ruin her morning, you will have to get in line behind me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell Gerry he cannot put a heron on a boy\u2019s sleeve and expect to remain untangled when the boy decides he is a river,\u201d Bu Dewi said, because she liked to scold men she had not fed. \u201cAlso tell him I will bring egg tarts to his party if and only if his people show me their ears before they come in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell him all of that,\u201d Satria said with an expression that suggested he would cut half and add a joke to soften what remained. He looked at Arif then, not quite meeting his eyes. \u201cThe schedule is locked. Press conference at noon tomorrow. Finale at dusk the day after. Rehearsal this afternoon for the people who insist on practicing walking onto a stage. If you don\u2019t come, Gerry will send a dragon to fetch you. He has one. She wears tamarind.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell Dara that if she arrives wearing scales I will fetch my net,\u201d Arif said, and Lila made a sound that might have been a cough and might have been a laugh trying to disguise itself so it wouldn\u2019t be asked to perform.\n\nAfter the shutter had rattled back down over the girl with the camera and the boy with the shoulder rig and Satria\u2019s headache, after the tarts had stopped announcing their availability, after Bu Dewi had set them to work wrapping pastry leaves in ribbon for reasons that made no sense until she explained a sponsor had paid to have garlands that would fall apart in an aesthetically pleasing manner, Arif stepped into the alley and breathed the particular stink of drains that had been loved and then abandoned. He took the letter out and unfolded it again with the care of a man who suspects his talisman might turn into paper right when he needs it to be a knife. The logo looked different in street light, less jaunty, more tired. He thought of the tiny memory he had plucked from last night like a coin from the harbor bottom\u2014cheering and ribbon edge\u2014and he tried to place it on the paper like a stamp. It didn\u2019t stick. It was not that he remembered more; it was that he was less afraid of not remembering.\n\nA woman with a scarf and a tray balanced on one hand passed, selling plastic bags of palm sugar and gingers. She paused and watched him like you watch a man who has met a river he cannot name. \u201cYou are the boy,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom the board. With the laugh. Last year my niece screamed at the television because she thought you would die.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI only dropped a thing I was told not to drop.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cBetter to drop a thing than a mouth.\u201d She shifted the tray and it flashed with small lights because sugar does that when it is fresh. \u201cYou will win again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to,\u201d he said, because honesty in alleys costs less than honesty under tents, and the woman nodded like he had paid correct change.\n\nOn the walk back to the quay, they passed the chalk feather again and this time Lila crouched and smudged it with her thumb until it was a blue bruise on the concrete. She stood up like she had erased a thing that did not deserve to be a picture. \u201cLet them draw birds,\u201d she said. \u201cWe draw boats.\u201d She tapped the letter in his pocket like a bell. \u201cWe draw our names on the water and make them float.\u201d\n\nThat afternoon, rehearsal was a caravan of people who liked to be important about minor things. A boy with a headset told Arif how to walk three steps and then stop, how to lift his chin as if he had been expecting applause since birth. He showed him where the stage would pretend to be a dock and where the cameras liked faces. Lila stood in the wings with a clipboard she had stolen from a girl who did not look old enough to drive and pretended to be unimpressed, which had the immediate and satisfying effect of making five different men try to impress her at once. Arif walked the three steps and stopped and lifted his chin and felt like a puppet whose string had been jerked by a child with sticky fingers. He did it again and made it his. He did it a third time and let himself look up beyond the lights to where the tent met sky, because he had promised himself not to act like a trapped animal even if some men thought that would sell more tickets.\n\nGerry surfed in and out of the rehearsal with a phone to his ear and a look that said he had decided stress was a brand and he wore it well. When he saw Lila, he went toward her like the letter H drawn by a drunk. He took her wrist in a friendly assault and made a pained sound at the rope burns, which meant he had realized there was a story there he could not tell because Dara would murder him publicly with etiquette. He offered her a jacket from a garment bag that had a bird embroidered on it so large it could have flown away if the stitches had less pride. She took it, because it was rude to refuse a gift in public, and folded it until the bird bent its head as if reconsidering its life choices.\n\nThe second-place woman from last year, the stout one with the headscarf and the kind face full of a steel that does not show itself until you bite it, found him backstage and stood beside him as if they had been arranged that way by someone who understood where to place a pillar when your roof was in doubt. \u201cI thought you had become a movie person,\u201d she said, as if confessing to a mistake about the weather. \u201cThey said you would not come back because people who win once prefer to be saints and statues. Good. I like beating men who are not statues.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou went home last year with a prize and a sugar coma,\u201d he said, and her laugh was the most human sound he\u2019d heard in an hour of camera rehearsal.\n\n\u201cI went home with money,\u201d she said. \u201cI bought my daughter a bicycle and forgave my neighbor for the way he speaks about my lawn. You dropped your trophy and I picked it up because I am a better mother than you are.\u201d She clapped him on the back hard enough to burp a baby. \u201cYour face looks like it has seen something that makes pie sound small. Don\u2019t bring big things to the table. You scare the crust.\u201d\n\nHe swallowed a line of gratitude because he wanted to put it somewhere private. He asked her if she remembered a ribbon across his thumb last year and she nodded slowly like a tree nods. \u201cYou broke it without meaning to,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made the crowd louder. It made you laugh. It made the organizer cry because he had paid for that ribbon and now it was nothing. Do you know how good it is to make a man cry because something is nothing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am learning,\u201d he said, and when she hugged him, he let himself be the boy in the photo for a second and nothing else.\n\nWhen the rehearsal broke into parts and fell apart entirely, when the lights went to sleep and the cables sighed, when Satria had been chased by three different clipboard girls about three different clipboards and looked like he would hide in a tent pole if he thought tent poles took pity on men, Arif and Lila walked away from the white scallops and toward the water because it was their habit and because habits you keep at the edge of something wide help your feet remember their job. The ferris wheel lit up and went dark again, a pulse that made people think they were seeing the city breathe. Men rolled cases toward vans. A child tried on his mother\u2019s shoes and clattered like a goat on a tin roof and made two aunties laugh until their eyes leaked.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Lila said, and her voice made that word into the correct size. \u201cPress and pie-tasting with old ladies who think the world is improved by telling boys what to do. After that, a night where we lock my stall and go home at nine like retirees. Then the day. Do you want me on stage with you or in the back making shapes with my face at you until you remember to swallow?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the back,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are on the stage I will look at your mouth when I should be looking at pies. If you are in the back I will look where your face will be and use that as a lighthouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cI like lighthouses. I like telling men when to stop. I am good at both.\u201d She kicked a cigarette butt that had been smug near the curb and sent it into a puddle. \u201cAlso, Dara sent a message that made my phone feel rich. She says she is borrowing the A boxes to teach a lesson at a meeting that uses long tables. She is going to build a drink that tastes like money without crime in it. She asked for my bitter. I told her she could have my peel but not my rind.\u201d\n\n\u201cDara with your peel,\u201d he said, picturing it and trying not to smile too obviously at the idea of that dry woman holding a wet lemon. \u201cBram will tell her where to pour it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBram will tell her where to stand so she does not get it on her shoes,\u201d Lila said. \u201cHe looks like a man who knows where messes begin even when the floor is still clean.\u201d\n\nOn the bus home, an old woman climbed aboard with a bucket of small fish and a child with hair braided so tight it could deflect arrows. The smell of the fish knocked the perfume of the city off its perch and made honesty of everything. Lila leaned her head on Arif\u2019s shoulder and when the bus turned, she stayed there. \u201cYou were right last night,\u201d she said into his shirt. \u201cAbout masks. I like Dara because she knows when to wear one and when to make it lift at the corner to show a tooth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like Bram because he is the kind of man who will pick up a knife when it is needed and then put it down where it belongs,\u201d Arif said, and watched the city blink slowly at them the way you watch a friend fall asleep mid-story.\n\nAt the Liris, the harbor night had already begun to erect its horizon of noise and light and rumor. Pak Kacek sat on the stern with a piece of rope and a stubborn knot because he could never sit without making a stand. He watched them approach and nodded at their lives as if he approved of their confusion. \u201cYou will win,\u201d he announced to the rope, which meant he was telling it a story about them. \u201cBecause it will be simpler if you do. The world is short on simple this week.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is simple,\u201d Arif said, and the older man grinned with all the satisfaction of a teacher telling a student they had finally answered correctly and would now be punished with more questions.\n\nHe lay that night with the ribbon under his thumb because he had decided a talisman could be made of anything if you handled it with a particular kind of faith. He listened to the tiny changes in the Liris\u2019s breath and picked out the minute he knew the tide shifted, and he promised himself he would sleep the hours he was owed because if he could not gather himself now he would not be able to hold anything tomorrow. In the quiet that wasn\u2019t quite quiet, he saw the photograph again, the eyes from the board bright as if someone had turned on a light from behind, and he saw a garland of pastry leaves, and he saw a man in a jacket cut like patience signal with two fingers as if inviting a soft instrument to play wrong. He did not see the face he had lost. He decided that was fine. Some men go to war with less and make worse decisions. He would go to a tent. He would go to a table. He would put his mouth where it belonged and take back what names he could.\n\nMorning made him honest about the bruise-blue feather on the quay because someone had chalked another near the warung gate, this time with a neatness that suggested pride. Lila lifted an eyebrow at it and then at him and he shrugged, because if he scowled at every bird he would spend his day hurting his own forehead. He bought two packets of boiled peanuts from a man whose hands had picked fish for twenty years and stressed about nothing else, and they ate standing up in line with other people waiting to be told where to go by small men with whistles and clipboards. The press secretary handed Arif a laminated pass with his name spelled too carefully and a packet of words he was supposed to say when someone gave him a microphone. He put the words in his back pocket and did not intend to use them.\n\nThe press conference was a circus that had tired of itself and wanted to go home. Gerry said three things at once and none of them refused to be true. He thanked Blue Heron; he praised Pie Nusantara; he put his hand on Arif\u2019s shoulder and used the word \u201cjourney\u201d twice, as if that could cover the distance between a freezer, a canal, and a stage. Dara sat in a chair too far from the microphone to be accused of stealing it and smiled with her eyebrows, which only people who are good at crime can do. Bram lurked in the peripherals as if he had been assigned the job of making sure no feathers entered the building without permission.\n\nA man in the back with a notebook the size of a plank and a chin like he could cut bread with it asked Arif about amnesia and triumph and redemption in the same breath and looked expectant. Arif took the microphone and felt the weight of it and decided to be bored by it instead of afraid. \u201cLast year I ate pies with joy,\u201d he said. \u201cThen a storm ate a piece of my head. This year I will eat pies with the same mouth and a better rope on my heart. If you need a story beyond that, I will introduce you to my cousin. She keeps them in jars, labeled.\u201d\n\nLila\u2019s laughter cut through the room like a clean instrument and even the men who were being paid to scowl were caught unprepared and smiled at it. Gerry tried to laugh like a bird. Dara didn\u2019t bother pretending. She watched him and when their eyes met she lifted an invisible glass and drank to a joke neither of them had told yet.\n\nAfterward, under the tent flap, a man with ink like seaweed at the side of his neck and a hopeful handshake introduced himself as Jonas, which felt like walking into a room that already knew your name. He wore a jacket that did not belong to him and a cologne that did. His hand was dry and his eyes were the same. \u201cWe have some overlap,\u201d he said to Arif in the tone of a man who suspects you have already decided how you feel about him and hopes to undo it with charm. \u201cTawa Promotions borrowed our boys for the opening. Blue Heron borrowed my mouth for a week. You know how it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer to borrow boats,\u201d Arif said mildly, and watched the man\u2019s mouth do a small arithmetic and come up at a number he didn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cI like your story,\u201d Jonas said, because when charm fails, some men try flattery and pray. \u201cEveryone likes a comeback.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone likes a man who doesn\u2019t get women tied up in freezers,\u201d Lila said into the space, and when Jonas flinched a fraction, as if someone had pointed a bright light at the wrong end of his day, Dara appeared like a punctuation mark that ends conversations and laid a hand like the idea of wealth on his elbow.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the wrong tent,\u201d she told him, and for a second he tried the trick of pretending not to understand her, and then he didn\u2019t, because people who wanted to continue eating at the right tables learned fast. He left the tent as if he had lost something and needed to find it without looking down.\n\n\u201cWill he try again?\u201d Arif asked Dara, and she made a face that said of course he would and of course he wouldn\u2019t, because men often made two decisions at once and then asked the night to choose.\n\n\u201cHe will try to be braver with different parts of his body,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will teach him to use those parts for walking. In the meantime, Bram has already replaced the A boxes with A-minus boxes and written a love letter to the man who thinks he made a new recipe last night. That man will read the letter tonight in the bathroom of his club and not sleep. Which is my favorite kind of justice.\u201d\n\nThey stepped back into the heat and the sugar and the shape of a day the city had decided to bake in a pan a little too small for it. Lila looped her arm through Arif\u2019s and steered him toward the vendors\u2019 alley because she could not help herself; a warung is a compass and she held it in her hands like a ship. \u201cWe work until sundown,\u201d she instructed. \u201cWe sleep like fishermen. We wake when the harbor clears its throat and pretends to be young. You stretch your mouth and your stubborn. I will make syrups and hide my pride where nobody can break it.\u201d\n\nHe made the face he made when he wanted to argue and set it aside the way you set aside a tool you love because the job requires a different one. He followed her, because boats follow the line through chop, because there is a way into everything if you stand at the edge long enough and let your eye soften until the shape appears. He listened to the city crash and purr. He felt the ribbon in his pocket and let his thumb worry it until the edge warmed under his skin. He tasted, in the back of his mouth where some truths stick, cinnamon and citrus and a small, stubborn promise that tomorrow his hands and his jaw would remember long enough for the rest of him to catch up.",

                              "content": "The afternoon folded itself into the kind of heat that made even the gulls look like they were conserving adjectives, and the tent people drifted away like a tide that had somewhere better to be. Lila installed herself in the back of her stall like a queen in a corrugated palace and set three pots to simmer at once, each with a different argument of peel and spice. The air filled up with lemon and ginger and the rounder, cuddlier warmth of palm sugar coaxed without mercy, and Arif stood at the edge of the counter with a knife and a bowl and the clear instruction not to bleed into anything they intended to sell. He found a rhythm in zesting because the skin yielded with the same whispering confidence as rope giving under a correct pull, and when he paused to shake the stripings into a tin, he caught himself smiling at the way the smell sat inside his head where worry had been renting a room. Lila counted under her breath while she stirred, not numbers this time but the days of the week backwards, because she said it kept all the other discipline in line, and when a boy tried to steal a fritter off the corner without paying she flicked a wet spoon at him and he laughed with good manners and paid anyway.\n\nPak Kacek came by pretending to look for a loose washer that had never existed and actually to check whether their faces had begun to look like faces who would survive the next twenty-four hours. He told a story about a Dutchman who mistook tamarind for a charm and wore it around his neck during monsoon and never caught a cold again but also never kept a friend, and then he leaned his elbows on the counter in a way that would have got him a scolding if any of the aunties who truly owned the alley had seen him. He watched Arif\u2019s hands on the knife and nodded once like he was acknowledging a rhythm that had finally remembered itself. When a scooter coughed too close and sprayed a mist of city in their direction, he put his body in front of Lila\u2019s pots like a door shaped like a person, and Lila pretended not to notice because noticing would have made the moment sentimental and then they would have had to make jokes to pay for it.\n\nBy the time the sun had climbed over the warung roofs and then thought better of the effort, Dara sent a message that was not a request and not quite a command, and it brought with it the picture in Arif\u2019s head of the Blue Heron\u2019s interior like a second geography. \u201cMeeting,\u201d it said. \u201cBring your bitter. Leave your pity.\u201d Lila made a face at the phone that would have made a less durable device crack and then decanted one of her syrups into a bottle that used to hold imported olives because repurposing felt like a particular kind of revenge. They rinsed their hands until they smelled like public water and soap instead of sugar and climbed into a taxi because the bus at that hour was a test of patience and they had already passed one exam today.\n\nInside the club there were fewer people and more light, and the light had been arranged by someone who liked to make money appear cleaner than it was. Dara sat at the end of a long table that looked like it had been made from a single piece of wood cut from a tree that had been asked for an apology and had not given one, and beside her was a small collection of men who had learned to dress expensively in ways that were supposed to make you forget which kampung had given them the first loan. Gerry paced the far side like a dog who had learned a trick and wanted someone to throw him a ball, and Jonas sat two chairs down with his hand around a glass and an expression like a man practicing contrition in a mirror. Bram stood by the window looking at the harbor as if it had whispered something rude and he was considering whether to laugh.\n\nDara placed one of the A-marked bottles on the table with a neatness that suggested a ceremony, and then she placed Lila\u2019s bottle beside it like a judge putting down two versions of the truth. She did not speak immediately, and the silence made the men\u2019s watches suddenly very loud. When she did finally use her mouth, she did it very gently, which made every sentence sound like an insult you would thank her for. She explained, crisp as paper edges, how private rooms have codes and codes leave footprints, how sponsors who desire discretion often confuse it with impunity, and how bitter is not an ingredient you purchase from a man with a radio and a logo; it is an agreement between tongue and throat and memory. She unscrewed the A bottle first and handed it to Gerry without looking at his face, then to Jonas, and then to a man with a square ring who had been pretending to be a piece of furniture. They sipped and made the faces men make when they do not want to admit they taste a mistake.\n\nLila said nothing until the very end of the tasting circle. She tipped a capful of her own syrup against her wrist and inhaled and then did the same with the A bottle, and something in her shoulders changed like a sail that had found its true wind. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to make expensive taste like medicine,\u201d she said quietly, directing the sentence not to Gerry because he would have made it into a lifestyle, but to Jonas because his eyes had flinched when he tasted the wrong bitter. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to teach a crowd to believe that a punishment is sophistication. That trick works until the second glass and then it ends with someone crying into a cab and telling the story wrong to a friend who will put it on the internet.\u201d\n\nJonas tried to smile with complicity and found he had no spare muscles for it. Gerry glanced at Dara and performed a sigh as if he had been expecting to be disappointed all his life and was relieved to finally have the chance. Dara cut a small slice of the air with two fingers and everyone\u2019s gaze followed it like a flock. \u201cWe will not serve your tonic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will serve something that makes people want to spend money because they are happy and not because they have been tricked into mistaking numbness for taste. If you insist on putting your logo on a bottle of quinine with delusions, you may do so in your own room for your own friends. If you insist on bringing boys with feathers behind their ears into my gardens, I will put seeds in their pockets they do not want.\u201d\n\nThe man with the ring began to protest in the language of legal men and long tables and contracts that believe they have souls, and Bram leaned off the window and into the room just enough to change the gravity. He did not threaten; he enumerated. He listed how many cameras had seen which cart and where the ribbon had been torn. He sketched, without naming, the video of Jonas with his hand on a handle that had been meant for chairs and not for people. He mentioned the boy with the candy and the freezer with the tired light. He asked whether anyone in the room wished to sublicense the kinds of stories that come blowing in off canals when the wind changes. By the time he finished, the man with the ring was polishing the square as if it had begun to feel tight.\n\nWhat made the meeting end was not Dara\u2019s ice or Bram\u2019s arithmetic, though either would have done; it was Lila sliding her bottle toward the center with two fingers and saying, without any drama, \u201cUse this or don\u2019t. But don\u2019t use me without paying me and thinking I won\u2019t notice.\u201d The sentence hung in the air like a banner at a parade, and even the air condicioning decided to hum less loudly for a moment. Gerry\u2019s smile tried on an expression that looked like sincerity and kept it because it fit better than he expected, and he nodded, and the kind of paperwork that births better nights began to unroll in the minds of men who had come ready to roll something else.\n\nOn the way out, Jonas drifted near with the intention of practicing contrition aloud, but Dara blocked him with a palm lifted like a traffic cop who has a manicure. She told him, without heat, that he had chosen the wrong kind of clever and he needed to choose the other kind before his luck bored itself. He swallowed and looked at Arif as if asking for a version of forgiveness he might somehow deserve, and Arif gave him the kind that has no words and is not forgiveness at all, just the decision to save his mouth for pies and not for men who had been warned.\n\nThey came back into the heat like swimmers who had misjudged the edge of a pool and were resigned to climbing instead of floating. Bram walked beside Arif with his hands in his pockets, which made him look like a person with less to do than he actually had. The street was a slow river of the stubborn and the tired and the genuinely happy, and somewhere close by a woman sold cut guava with salt that made its own weather in your mouth. \u201cFeathers are a cheap symbol,\u201d Bram said after a block, not looking at him and yet speaking to the exact part of Arif that needed speaking to. \u201cPretty, easy to draw, suggests flight and grace but also an ache, because what is a feather without a body. People love ache. They forget depth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is his body,\u201d Arif asked, because men like Jonas do not buy fifty cheap tattoos without admiring a bird that thinks it is a river. \u201cWho lifts his wings when the money is heavy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone with a name that doesn\u2019t belong in a mouth that earns its own money,\u201d Bram said, and his tone was not bored so much as clinical. \u201cA man you\u2019ve seen at docks and offices and tables where women are asked to laugh. He will not approach you yet because you are a story he hasn\u2019t decided the ending of. He will send boys with more nerve than sense. He will experiment with how much lemon it takes to cover a taste people shouldn\u2019t be swallowing.\u201d\n\nArif let that settle like a coin at the bottom of a glass. He did not love the idea of becoming anyone\u2019s experiment again, even in metaphor, and he was surprised at the small joy that accompanied the thought of being boring to the kind of men who made fevers into business models. \u201cThen we bore him,\u201d he said. \u201cWe win the contest, we drink gentle drinks, we sleep, and he finds another bird to pluck.\u201d\n\nBram smiled with one corner of his mouth because he appreciated hope when it dressed itself in work clothes. \u201cAnd while he looks away,\u201d he said, \u201cwe cut the string on his kite.\u201d\n\nThe evening let them go slowly, like a hand hanging on to yours a breath too long and then choosing not to insult you by pretending it had simply forgotten to unclasp. Back at the quay the light had the drowsy tilt of a man who wants to tell another story and cannot decide between a lie and a miracle; the Liris rocked with the particular patience of things built to endure time instead of attention. Lila, who had declared herself unwilling to make any more syrup until the morning ruined itself, produced a pot of rice, a wok that looked like it had participated in six family histories, and a small hill of leftover fried fish that she attacked with a fork until it became something a person could call a new dish without guilt. Arif cleaned two cucumbers with the quick strokes of someone who had learned, young, that water tastes like various truths depending on what you put next to it, and they ate on the stern under a sky that consented to be dramatic without going to the trouble of becoming storm.\n\nSomewhere between second helping and the kind of soft quiet that comes only after the kitchen no longer needs you, the ribbon in Arif\u2019s pocket stopped being just an edge against his thigh and turned into a small bright nerve under his thumb, and he closed his eyes without meaning to. He could feel, for half of one breath, the exact moment last year when the crowd had become large enough that it had its own heartbeat, and he could hear the cheer tilt like a wave and almost break on the sound of cloth tearing when his thumb caught the riband, and his mouth remembered making a joke that made no sense and made perfect sense because his blood had been ninety percent sugar and the rest adrenaline. It was not a whole memory, and it did not deliver the face he had worn that day back to him like a gift, but it left a wet footprint where there had been none, and he cherished it as a man cherishes signs that his boat hasn\u2019t forgotten the channel yet.\n\nHe slept then like a person who had been given permission by a boat and woke with that permission intact. Morning tried out the idea of rain and decided against it, which meant the air was wet anyway and everyone had an extra complaint to carry around. The schedule was a ladder: a vendor round at nine because Lila had arranged swaps with two aunties who had tamarind she coveted and couldn\u2019t be bothered to buy, another rehearsal at eleven that nobody needed and everyone would attend because rehearsal rooms are where gossip is free, and a phrase called \u201csecurity walkthrough\u201d at three that made Arif itch. He watched the quay breathe and spotted, with an uncharitable satisfaction, that the chalk feather had been trampled by a wheelbarrow and then spat on by a man who hated the way the color blue sometimes thought it owned the sky.\n\nIt was Lila who saw the boy first, because her eyes loved intent like a cat loves a half-closed door. He loitered near the stall with the stance of a child who has been told to loiter without getting slapped by an aunt he doesn\u2019t know, and his hand sat in his pocket like it had been tied there. He waited until what he thought would be the perfect unsuspecting moment and moved toward Lila\u2019s prep bench with an insouciance that could have been admirable if it hadn\u2019t been so obvious, and her hand clamped his wrist so fast his whole arm told him truths. The vial he had been carrying went cold and brittle between their fingers, and she lifted it gently as if it were a small glass opinion that might shatter if mishandled.\n\n\u201cInside voice,\u201d she said to him, and then to Arif, \u201cOpen that with your nose, not your hands.\u201d The boy stared at the ground and at the vial and at Lila\u2019s braid like he had only just noticed hair was a thing people owned; he couldn\u2019t have been more than fourteen and he had done very badly at choosing which adults to believe this week. Arif flicked the cap and brought the mouth of the little bottle near without letting it touch skin, and a whiff of something tidy and unfriendly wrote itself in the front of his head. It was a polite cousin of what they had tasted in the A bottle and a poor liar, and it would have made an honest drink taste like a debt.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Lila asked, not unkindly and not gently, and the boy made the small fish mouth that belongs to children who have been bribed by men who do not keep promises. He told them a name he didn\u2019t know how to spell and the location of a gaming shop near Kota Tua where tall men laughed too hard at their own jokes. He held his other wrist with his free hand like the limb warranted sympathy for being caught and confessed, in a rush, that he had been promised a pair of shoes that make YouTube boys tall if he would pour this where told and then leave it because he was stupid and the shoes were beautiful and his mother\u2019s back hurt and the world told him stories in which handsome men are forgiving.\n\nPak Kacek had watched the entire exchange with the calm of a storm that hasn\u2019t decided which village to pick up yet. He stepped closer now and the boy flinched out of habit, then relaxed when he realized this was not a man who hit children in front of other people. \u201cYou will take those shoes,\u201d Pak decreed, which earned him a scandalized look from both Lila and Arif that pleased him very much. \u201cYou will take them, you will sell them to a person who collects ugly things and does not run, and you will bring your mother a bag of rice and a duck. Then you will come to me on Tuesday and learn to tie a knot I can trust. If you don\u2019t arrive, I will assume you tripped on your own lie and drowned and I will send a ghost to your house who eats only shoes.\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded with the awe that belongs to threats that include poultry and supernatural consequences, and Lila handed him a parcel of fritters and a bottle of proper lemon syrup and told him this was the kind of sweetness that did not ask his mouth to forget its manners. The vial went into Bram\u2019s pocket later with the look of a man who collected other men\u2019s laziness for fun, and when, in the afternoon, Arif stood on the stage and was told once again to lift his chin so the camera could see his soul, he did it without flinching because some parts of the day had opted for comedy instead of horror and he intended to thank them by participating.\n\nThe night before the final laid itself across the city like a blanket a grandmother would approve of\u2014weighty enough to dampen nonsense, light enough to allow breath. Lila closed the shutter on her stall earlier than her enemies would have dared, announced to the alley that tomorrow was for shouting and today was for boiling water and rubbing feet, and accepted the scandalized murmurs as her due. They walked the long way back to the Liris because the longer you take getting to a bed the better it rewards you, and under the footbridge someone had drawn three chalk feathers and then drawn a boat over them, and the boat had a mast that leaned like an ear. Arif looked down at it and, without smiling, felt the mule in his chest stop kicking so hard.\n\nHe sat on the deck while the harbor talked to itself, the ribbon under his thumb and the taste of cinnamon and citrus at the back of his tongue the way a good song sits behind your teeth. He let his breath lengthen because he would ask it to do ugly work tomorrow and he wanted to be grateful in advance. He thought about the faces he would not have to look at when the lights hit him, about the hands he would hear more than see, about the discipline of letting your eyes soften past cameras to focus on a cousin\u2019s silhouette that would stand at the very back of the tent where the shadows could do their job. He thought, ferociously and with a simplicity that shocked him into laughter, about eating. He imagined the first crust and the second and how he would not let sweet become his enemy until he was ready to set the knife down himself, and he promised the part of him that knew how to listen to the sea that he would come back to his own deck after and not belong to anyone else\u2019s table.\n\nSleep took him with both hands and put him down in a place he recognized, and, just before the floor under him turned into the first swell of a dream, he felt the raw edge of a ribbon press against his thumb and knew, with an absolute that required no witness, that even if the rest of the memory refused him, that one sound, tear and cheer braided together, would not leave. When he woke, it was with that sound still in his mouth and the light on the ceiling doing its best to be gentle, and outside, the harbor cleared its throat as if it had something important to say and wanted to make sure he heard it. He reached for the letter before he reached for his cigarettes, folded it back along the crease he had almost broken, and put it into his pocket like a quiet flag. Then he went up into the morning to find Lila hunched over her pot like a soldier over a map, ready to tell him where to place his feet and how to keep them there when the world tried to move him.",

                              "content": "The morning decided to be noisy in a clean way, a kind of bustle that made the harbor\u2019s complaints sound like encouragement, and for once Arif let the racket enter him without sorting it into categories he could fix or ignore. Lila had mapped the day on a scrap of cardboard with arrows and insults, and she moved between her pots with the precision of someone who had invented muscle memory out of stubbornness. The lemon peels sat like curled tongues on the board, the ginger wore its dirt like jewelry, and the palm sugar broke under her spoon with a sound that made the alley pause because it resembled success. Arif took the crate of bottles and rinsed them with a fastidiousness that would have made a pharmacist proud, then stood a moment with his hands in the sink because the water was the exact temperature of a shouted blessing and he had discovered he could collect himself better when his knuckles were submerged. He caught his reflection in the steel and gave it a nod that wasn\u2019t bravado and wasn\u2019t apology, then set about arranging the labels Lila had written in her hurried square hand, each one like a piece of her personality stuck to glass.\n\nSatria arrived before his shadow like a man who had remembered to be early but hadn\u2019t remembered what to do with the time, and he hovered at the edge of the stall wringing his radio as if it were laundry. He had a list and the list was annoyed with him, and he delivered his reminders to the air more than to the people who needed to receive them because he had learned that speaking toward Lila directly this week resulted in bruises to his pride. Security would sweep vendor lanes at ten; the sponsor wanted an insert piece at eleven where contestants pretended to choose their favorite pies; the press wanted a walk-through shot at noon where Gerry would say \u201ccommunity\u201d five times. Lila handed him a cup of warm syrup-water before he had finished the third item and watched him drink like a mother with an opinion about posture, and when he smacked his lips in surprise at the absence of bitterness she allowed herself a small smirk and called it breakfast so he couldn\u2019t argue that she had fed him.\n\nBy midmorning the fairground had put on its festival clothes with conviction. Banners that yesterday had looked like laundry now pretended to be flags, and the Mariana Tent swelled with a pride that had very little to do with fabric and a lot to do with the cables that were finally tensioned correctly. Arif walked the edge of the space the way he walked the Liris\u2019s deck after a storm, checking lines and corners for the sort of wrongness you can\u2019t name until it taps you on the shoulder. He greeted Bu Dewi, who had commandeered a corner of a prep table with the authority of a queen on a small throne, and she thumped his chest with the back of her fingers and told him to stop acting like a man about to pray and act like a man about to chew. He glanced toward the service corridor that had tried to swallow his cousin and felt nothing but a brief, clean anger, a steel wire stretched under his breastbone that hummed only when someone pushed against it.\n\nDara appeared as if the tent had manufactured her, a pleasure of silk where there had recently only been canvas, and stood with her hands clasped behind her back like a teacher evaluating whether to pass a troublesome class. Bram drifted at her shoulder, which made their pairing look like punctuation in a sentence that intimidated commas. They checked the carts discreetly and then not discreetly, which achieved not only security but also a performance of it that discouraged improvisation. When Gerry came flapping like a pelican with a clip-on mic, Dara allowed him to stand too close for thirty seconds, then pulled him away by his jacket lapel with such elegance he thanked her after and did not know why. Jonas passed the far end of the tent and didn\u2019t pass in, which suited everyone, and the boy with the new toothbrush\u2019s neck looked raw where the ink had been scrubbed, which made Arif feel a dark, petty satisfaction he did not examine closely.\n\nThe press rehearsal was chaos with excellent lighting, and Arif said his name and the name of his boat four times for four different cameras and made sure to say his cousin\u2019s name every time so that any story told later without her in it would look shabby. He discovered that if he held the microphone slightly farther from his mouth than anyone suggested, the sound man smiled like a man blessed with mercy, and he made a point of liking the sound man so that he could like the whole process more. When a woman in a blazer asked him what pie meant to him and refused to accept \u201can opportunity to eat politely in public\u201d as an answer, he spoke about crust and labor and the way a country\u2019s arguments become food that refuses to taste like an argument, and she blinked as if the response had contained a small philosophy she would have to edit around. Lila, just off camera, rolled her eyes and drew a small boat on the corner of her clipboard, and when he glanced at her scribble he nearly laughed into the mic and had to pretend he was coughing instead.\n\nBackstage felt like the inside of a chest about to inhale, and the contestants who had done this before radiated the calm of people who have eaten too much and learned not to die. The stout woman with the headscarf who had taken second last year\u2014you couldn\u2019t think of her as anything but Kak Ayu once you had heard her scold a nephew through a mouthful of pastry\u2014stood beside him and tested the seat of the stool as if preparing to argue with it, and she handed him a rubber band with a solemnity reserved for sacred rites. He looked at it with question written across his face and she wrapped it around his wrist herself, not tight, and told him that when the sugar began to talk nonsense he should snap it once to remind his blood of salt. He nodded and thanked her like a man just given a charm by a witch in a market, and when she winked with half a lid and told him not to embarrass her by fainting, he promised to embarrass her in other ways instead.\n\nThey called the finalists to the curtains because men with clipboards always appear in multiples, and Satria executed his one indispensable function: he made eye contact with Arif and used his eyebrows to ask a question about readiness that contained apology, gratitude, and panic. Arif nodded in a way that gave him an excuse to walk away to harass someone else. The noise in the tent thickened, laughter piling on laughter until the roof had something heavier than fabric to hold up, and the front rows filled with aunties who would judge everything and still cheer, teenagers who filmed each other\u2019s faces instead of the stage, and a smattering of men who liked to explain to their dates what eating is. Somewhere in the middle was a seat saved by someone important who had texted that they were on their way, and Arif decided he would pretend no such person existed because he had learned that invisible people take up the most room.\n\nHe stood, just inside the curtain\u2019s shadow, and watched the first wave of introduction wash over the tent. The emcee had the voice of a man who could make a riot feel like a raffle and he said Arif\u2019s name with that rolling grandeur that makes syllables stick together, and the crowd made the right noise at the right time, which is the kind of mercy performers spend lifetimes craving. He stepped out into the light and let the heat strike him like an oath, and he chose his pace the way you choose a path across a moving deck, slow enough to be stubborn, quick enough to be polite. He did not look for Lila because he had promised her and himself not to, and instead he looked at the top edge of the tent where the canvas turned into sky, and the line held like a sentence he could finish. When the emcee handed him a ribboned garland to wear later and the ribbon\u2019s end brushed his hand, a small electric bolt ran up his thumb to his jaw, and he put the sensation in his pocket beside the actual strip of blue and the letter, folded almost to death.\n\nThe first round was savory, as if the tournament wished to prove that it had learned restraint since last year\u2019s festival of sugar. Beef rendang wrapped in flaky pastry that threw crumbs like confetti at every attempt to be dignified, a jackfruit curry pie that smelled like someone\u2019s cousin telling a story loudly and well, and a mushroom thing that declared politely it would not be anyone\u2019s favorite and therefore would last long enough to be remembered. Arif took the stool and planted his feet as if he intended to grow roots through the plywood and into the ground, and he accepted the first plate with a small bow to the auntie who handed it to him because he had decided all hands that fed him would be acknowledged. The water pitchers were arranged exactly as Bu Dewi had insisted, and he took a breath in the space between first bite and second that had been paced his whole body for him, and he began.\n\nIt was not a storm at first. It was a river that understood where it was going and did not panic about the bends. The rendang brought heat that sat like an educated older relative on his shoulder and advised him not to rush, and he nodded internally and obeyed, letting the flakes do their work, letting warm water carry corners where they needed to go. He let his jaw be a machine he did not manage, only monitored, and when the emcee shouted something he didn\u2019t catch, the crowd\u2019s answer washed over him and left nothing behind but a thin residue of approval that did not distract. He had thought he would need to think of fishing to survive the stage, but it turned out that all he needed to think about was bite, swallow, breathe, and the way his tongue could be told to enjoy salt without betraying him to thirst.\n\nHe glanced once, allowed himself that, to the back corner where the tent met the darker air, and saw the angle of Lila\u2019s jaw and the quirk at the corner of her mouth she thought made her look stern and actually made her look like home. She was not counting animals this time; she was counting backward by lemon peels, which he recognized because he had watched her do it when she thought twice at once. When his eyes flicked front again, they caught Kak Ayu\u2019s grin, and the older woman exaggerated a breath and a swallow for him as if they were teammates in a game nobody else understood, and he obeyed her because she was right. The buzzer for the first round went off with a triumphal whine that had ambitions, and he put his hands in his lap a second before it sounded, just to practice letting go before something wrenched letting go out of him.\n\nBetween rounds Gerry swanned onstage with a silver tray to do a sponsor gag and managed not to drop anything, which caused the audience to clap too hard because there is always a certain relief in the avoidance of a small disaster. Dara offered a polite wave with fingers barely separated enough to constitute a gesture, and Jonas hovered, applauding with the air of a man who would like to be mistaken for someone better while hoping no one asks for specifics. Satria looked like someone had told him he could go home early if no speakers caught fire, and he took his new privilege seriously. Arif took the opportunity to stretch his hands, flex his throat with warm water, and let his gaze pass over the tent like a searchlight looking for nothing, because sometimes the looking soothes without needing to find.\n\nThe second round brought fruit pies the tent had argued about for weeks in kitchens and group chats. There was apple, because it soothed the anxieties of judges who had learned their English from television, but the apples had been convinced to grow in Indonesian pastry, which made them less pious and more fun. There was soursop, which tried to be shy and failed in a charming way, and a pineapple that bit back just enough to flirt. The durian tart did not appear yet because Bu Dewi had declared it a finale and nobody with any sense argued with her. Arif let the sweetness come and did not let it stay, ushering each mouthful along with a city bus conductor\u2019s efficiency, a hand hovering, a nod, an insistence. He felt, once or twice, the sugar whispering an invitation to a dream, and he took the rubber band and let it kiss his wrist with that clean snap that felt like a boyhood game, and the whisper went away to bother someone else.\n\nHalfway through the pineapple, with his mouth in that exact balance between grateful and polite, the garland\u2019s loose ribbon end brushed his thumb again, and for a second the tent shifted and he was standing in the exact light he had stood in last year. The noise bent like sugar glass, and he saw himself laughing with a garland crooked, the blue edge under his thumb, Lila\u2019s face shining in a way he had not allowed himself to think about because it felt like stealing from a version of himself he could not name. He felt the heat of a hand on the back of his neck that could only have been Pak Kacek\u2019s, steady and vulgar and loving, pushing him back toward the stage when he had staggered off it too quickly. The sensation lasted the length of a swallow and then collapsed, but it left behind a map he did not have to hold to follow.\n\nHe did not let the map make him faster. He did not let it make him sentimental. He used it like a skipper uses the feel of a particular crosscurrent under his hull, a fraction of a correction here that makes the turn more elegant an hour hence. When the emcee, hungry for drama, asked him to show the crowd how a champion enjoys a pie, he put his mouth on a slice of apple and chewed slow enough for the first row to laugh at their own nervousness, then broke the pace so hard that the laughter turned into a cheer because people love to be wrong in the correct direction. He could feel his body beginning to treat sugar like a friend who had overstayed, and he fed it warm water and a thought about salt and carried it into the next round with firm courtesy.\n\nSavory returned to rescue the tent from itself. The organizers called it Tradition and then giggled at their own audacity because nothing that uses shredded chicken and coconut so sincerely is truly traditional in a city that changes recipes whenever a wind blows from another island. The pies had names that made the emcee pronounce vowels with reverence and for once his choice was correct, and the smell of lemongrass under butter made more than one auntie elbow the person next to her and declare that this, at least, tasted the way memory claims. Arif took the chicken lemongrass, smiled at the fact that his hands did not shake, and let the bird and the grass tell his jaw where to go.\n\nHe felt the wobble at the edge of his knees three bites later the way you feel a floor flex on a ferry and know someone loaded a truck wrong, and he set the pie down for exactly two counts like a man refuses to be rushed and then picked it up again without drama. Kak Ayu snorted with approval and increased her own pace because she had been waiting for him to remember that grace is a show you give the audience to convince them not to worry about you, and as he matched her, a chant began in the back of the tent that had nothing to do with names and everything to do with mouth sounds people make when their bodies want permission to shout. He felt the tent open like a lung, and he breathed with it, and it gave some of its air back to him as if it had made it in the first place just so that he could take it.\n\nThe finale arrived like a relative you had been dreading and were delighted to see anyway. Bu Dewi\u2019s durian tart came borne by two aunties who knew not to tilt the plate because dignity is not a liquid, and even the men who claim to hate the fruit looked interested because they admired bravado. The emcee did not try a joke because he had learned, if not humility, then at least when to fear it, and he stood back with his microphone like a man giving space to an avalanche. The smell walked down the first row and slapped every nose and was slapped back with adoration, and Arif felt something similar to love and decided he would tell nobody that because it would ruin three people\u2019s afternoons.\n\nHe took his slice and let the fat and the sugar and the echo of something alchemical sit on his tongue just long enough to remind his brain what to call it, then pushed it along politely with warm water and a strict instruction to his throat not to be clever. The second bite tried to announce itself as the one that would make him slow dramatically in a way that cameras could interpret as vulnerability, and he pushed past it with the moral superiority of a man who has been lectured by a cousin wearing lipstick. He tasted a note in the custard that was not Bu Dewi\u2019s and realized she had been merciful and added a whisper of citrus to calm the extravagant animal, and he sent her gratitude with a side-eye and a nod and she received it with a snort and a raised spoon like a salutation.\n\nHe heard the cheer begin in the back again, the one with no name, the one that belonged to mouths and lungs and the question of whether any of us are ever doing anything except proving we can use the bodies we are in, and under it he heard the thready sound of ribbon scraping thumb, not from fabric but from memory, and he let himself press into it as he took the next mouthful. He did not speed up. He did not slow down. He reached the end of his plate before he had planned to by three swallows and let the space sit empty because he would not be ruled by the space any more than by the plate, and he took water into himself like a promise instead of a hedge against fear.\n\nIt became evident, in that not-dramatic way that good narratives become evident, that the contest was between him and Kak Ayu again, and the cameras thirsted like bad friends for a frame they could put on thumbnails, and Arif and the woman chose to give them something better. They widened their jaws with a shared joke and then narrowed their eyes as if demanding the pies try harder, and they moved hunger out of theater and into craft. When the emcee went too close to Kak Ayu with his microphone, she did not swat him; she fed him a crumb with such authority the front row roared, and when the camera dipped too close to Arif\u2019s face he gave it the expression he had saved, the one that said this is work, not spectacle, but lucky you, you get to watch.\n\nThe buzzer that ended the round did not sound like anything but a buzzer; it did not carry glory in its mouth, and Arif was grateful for that because he did not want glory to sound like a machine. He set his hands in his lap again, the habit now a rhythm rather than a rehearsal, and he let himself turn his head. The back of the tent had gone into that slow-motion quiet that happens when bodies forget to coordinate, and Lila\u2019s chin was up and her eyes were shining in a way that no longer hurt him to see because he had earned the right to be looked at like that again. He exhaled and let his shoulders drop and realized they had been up around his ears, and then he stood because the emcee had said something like \u201ccount\u201d and numbers had their way with tables and people\u2019s breath.\n\nThe tally took long enough for three stupid things to have happened and none did, which felt like a gift. Someone tried to start a wave and gave up. A small boy asked his mother if champions get to choose their own bedtimes and was told yes by a woman who knew how to keep men happy. Gerry whispered at Dara and got a no with such elegance he found himself smiling as if the refusal had been dessert, and Satria stared at a cable tie like it had offended his religion. Bram leaned near a support column with his hands in his pockets and the ghost of a smile and met Arif\u2019s gaze and tipped his head half a degree in the universal language of men who are ready to do something quietly violent if anyone asks them to, and Arif tipped his head back the exact measure that says Not today, thank you.\n\nWhen the emcee stretched the last syllable of Arif\u2019s name as if trying to make it into a bridge and then screamed it as if he were birthing it himself, the tent breathed and the roof held and the cheering landed on Arif\u2019s shoulders like birds who had chosen him. He did not pretend to be surprised because the kind of false humility that impresses strangers would have hurt his friends; he let delight register because he wanted to see it on Lila\u2019s face like sunrise. He went forward without bounding, because bounding belongs to men who think the world owes them the kind of romance that makes ankles break, and he accepted the ribboned garland\u2014a new one, ridiculous and perfect\u2014and the trophy shaped like a pie and as heavy as an insult. He felt the blue again under his thumb and this time when it tore, because it would always tear, because the edge was wrong for the knot, he tore it deliberately and offered the torn end to Kak Ayu like a shared dessert, and she snatched it with a grin and bit it for the camera and the photo was the kind of photo people will put above their televisions when they need to remember that theater is a trustworthy liar.\n\nHe laughed. It was the same laugh as the one on the board and it was not, because last year\u2019s laugh had been full of surprise and sugar and a young man\u2019s invincibility, and this year\u2019s carried the weight of a freezer and a canal and a boy with a toothbrush and a woman in a tamarind dress telling him to choose his fights. It tasted like cinnamon and citrus and salt because Lila had added salt to everything that week, including Arif\u2019s illusions, and he laughed until he had to put the trophy down because he is not a man who loves props. He leaned into Kak Ayu\u2019s side as if she were a cousin and said something about rice that made only their row laugh, and then he straightened and did the one indulgence he had promised himself he would allow if the crowd permitted it. He faced the back of the tent like it was his real stage and bowed his head for half a beat, and when he lifted it Lila was wiping her cheek with the heel of her hand with a ferocity that insisted the tear was a mistake, and he believed her because it made her happy to be believed.\n\nThe afterpieces were the same kind of nonsense they are everywhere, no matter the country. Photographs he would not want to look at later and would be forced to, microphones thrust like a plant you don\u2019t remember planting that needs watering right now, offers to take his jacket off and put another one on because someone needed a story about transformation. He did his duty and smiled at two children who had been bribed with balloons to care about pastry, and he held up a slice of something for a camera and did not put it in his mouth, and he stood for a group of bakers who wanted a picture for their wall and meant it when he told them he would come and eat their cakes and give them honest opinions. He did not allow Gerry to drape the Blue Heron jacket over his shoulders, and when the man persisted and flirted with the edge of flustered, Dara rescued them both by performing the kind of small social surgery that leaves nobody bleeding and everyone grateful.\n\nHe slipped offstage not like a thief but like a man finished with a job, and the backstage corridor made a sound like a kettle cooling because the energy had to go somewhere and decided to evaporate. Lila met him halfway to the water coolers and slipped her fingers into his and squeezed once so hard his bones chimed, and then she let go and punched him in the shoulder because this felt safer under a tent full of people who love to talk. He bent his head and she stood on her toes and he kissed her forehead because nobody could make that vulgar and because some gestures needed to be taught to anyone watching, and then they stood a second with their foreheads almost touching and let the noise go over them like the after-blow of a wave that had decided not to capsize a small boat after all.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d she said, and shoved a banana fritter at his mouth as if it were medicine, because in her hands it was, and he obeyed and felt the grease chase the sugar out and go sit in his stomach like a caretaker on a night shift. \u201cDrink. Sit. Don\u2019t say yes to anything that asks for your soul. Only give them the parts you can regrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich parts are those?\u201d he asked, and she pretended to check his elbows like a butcher being practical.\n\n\u201cThe laugh,\u201d she decided. \u201cKeep lending that out. And the way you breathe when you decide not to be afraid. That one you can give to anyone who asks nicely. Keep the ribbon. Keep the way you look at boats.\u201d\n\nBack by the service carts Bram affected the disinterest of a man who has used a whole day\u2019s quota of interest and finds he has an emergency reserve anyway, and he inclined his head at the trophy, then at Arif\u2019s face, in that order because he had opinions about sequence. There was a flash of something like pride in him that he did not allow to take up the whole room, and then he moved as if he were about to go chase a different problem with a net, and Arif stopped him with a hand on his sleeve because there were too many things in him that might become foolish if not given to someone safe. He thanked him with words that were not elaborate and that made Bram glance down once like he had heard a bird that is rare in the city, and then Bram told him, with a casualness that was a lie for his benefit, that the man with the ring had been quiet since noon, which in their world meant a lawyer had told him to hibernate.\n\nOutside the tent the late afternoon had chosen drama after all and stacked clouds in layers like a cake for a wedding that would end in a fight, and there was wind on the water that smelled like change and the burnt electricity of machines who are bored of themselves. The crowd spilled into the midway in a version of happiness that did not involve anyone shouting at anyone else, and vendors were declaring that their stock had been underestimated and that their hands were tired and that their children would eat and the television would be loud. Arif found himself imagining the harbor at night when he was a boy, and how he had lain on his back and told Lila names of foreign boats like an aunt telling gossip, and he felt as stupidly lucky as a man who has jumped a wave and landed with both ankles willing.\n\nThe Blue Heron after-party sat on the city\u2019s tongue like a bet it intended to win, and there was work left to do there that had nothing to do with pastry. Dara had promised to build a drink that tasted like money without making anybody a liar, and she had promised to teach men the limits of feathers, and Lila had promised to make syrup that made your mouth remember kindness first and none of them were in the habit of breaking promises made under tent lights. Arif thought of the freezer and the canal and the boy and the toothbrush and the ugly shoes that might yet become rice and a duck, and he decided he would go to a club and stand in a corner and not drink anything with a name because he would rather watch a woman who could fold a room into a better shape do her work.\n\nAt the Liris, Pak Kacek had tied the line in a way that said he was showing off for anyone who might be watching, which is to say, the boat. He saw them approach with their ridiculous trophy and their smaller ridiculous garland and made a face like he disapproved of celebrations that required dusting, then kissed the trophy, very quickly, when he thought nobody would see. He told a story about a sailor who won a pig at a fair by guessing its weight and then had to carry it home because the pig refused to be led, and he told it in such a way that the moral could have been anything from \u201cchoose your prizes with wisdom\u201d to \u201ctie better knots\u201d and he left them to decide which because good educators are lazy and proud. Lila held up the ribbon strip and he took it without asking for explanation and made of it a loop he could tie to a place near the companionway where good-luck garbage lives on boats, and he put a knot in it that would only come undone if insulted.\n\nThey ate, modestly, because their bodies had had enough indignity for one day, and they sat with their feet up in a way that would have made their grandmothers scold and their grandfathers grin, and they made a plan that was not a plan so much as a list of where to stand and who to deflect and what to avoid being photographed doing. They agreed not to wake Bu Dewi because she would wake herself when her brain decided to swing its lantern around the room of her ideas, and they agreed to take the long road to the club because the short road had too many men who loved putting their hands on other people\u2019s backs to steer them.\n\nAt Blue Heron the door had learned to smile, which is to say the doorman had had a conversation with humility, and the heron on the wall lifted its metal head not at all because art has nothing to say to days like these. Inside, the room had been altered in small ways that would only be noticed by people who make and break rooms for a living. The bar\u2019s back shelf held Lila\u2019s bottle in pride of place, not by label because she didn\u2019t have one, but by aura, and Dara stood with one hip against the wood like a general in peacetime. The men with rings and jackets looked like men who had been shown a boundary and decided to live, for now, on the safe side of it, and Gerry was overacting his own good behavior so hard it became charming despite itself.\n\nThere were toasts. There are always toasts. Dara raised her glass not high, because you don\u2019t need God to watch you for truth, and spoke about work and mouths and how it is rude to build a city with your waist and your back and then pretend the mouths are decoration. She did not say Jonas\u2019s name and did not look at him and the omission made him smaller than any insult could have achieved. Bram said nothing and the nothing was generous. Lila accepted three compliments and corrected one recipe and refused to take money for the first batch of syrup because she had decided the proper payment would be in favors owed and a small plaque near the bathroom that said \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid\u201d in a nice font. Arif, who had no gift for clubs, stood with his back to a column and watched men pretend their hearts had never been dangerous.\n\nHe saw him then, not because the man had announced himself but because the room tilted half a degree and his eyes, newly taught to read that particular tilt, followed without his consent. Not Jonas, not the ring, not the boy, but the person their feathers dreamed of being attached to, the one who had hired impatience as a personality. He was not tall or short and his suit did not have a seam out of place and his shoes had a softness to their shine that indicated calfskin and a deliberate decision to never cross a road without a car waiting for him. He had a face that would not survive humor and eyebrows that had practiced disapproval in the mirror until it looked natural. He did not look at Arif, because men like him do not look at sailors until sailors have made a mess, and for a moment Arif felt the old compressor of his chest try to turn on and he unplugged it because there was nothing that needed pressure right now.\n\nDara approached the man as if they were opposite teams instructed to act like cousins at a funeral. She smiled with the precise number of teeth that make rich men behave, and she said something inaudible and the man did that quick little shake of the head men do when they are refusing something they consider beneath them, which made Bram\u2019s mouth quirk in a way that meant somebody had just made a list longer. The three of them stood in a triangle that looked like a math problem and then the triangle solved itself with a shrug and a nod and a later, and the man drifted away like a large fish that has decided the net looks too expensive to be worth chewing.\n\nLila slid beside Arif and slid a glass into his hand and told him to drink because it would be bad manners to refuse to honor the part of the day that didn\u2019t require a napkin. He sipped and felt her syrup behave the way it had promised it would\u2014sharp where sophistication tends to lie, sweet where nostalgia pretends to be honest, bitter only in memory. She leaned into his side like she had chosen to and not because her ankles had lost interest in standing, and they watched Dara make the room do as it was told with posture and a smile and a casual sentence about a river that made three men look at their shoes. They did not speak for a while, because mouths sometimes improve a scene by closing.\n\nWhen they left, the club let them, which is not a kindness you can count on. The night outside was honest and held no adjectives beyond wet and electric, and the walk back felt like a procession of two that nobody else needed to witness. The garland had lost two pastry leaves and they ate them with indecent pleasure because stealing from symbols makes them feel useful. The harbor sang the song it always sings when it is ready to be a mirror, and the Liris lifted them as if to prove a point to the other boats watching. Lila went below with a declaration about washing her face until it remembered mercy, and Arif stood at the rail with his fingers on the ribbon loop and his thumb worrying the little raw edge he had made on purpose, and he allowed himself to close his eyes and see two versions of himself stacked like transparencies and feel less anger at the space between them than he would have thought he was allowed.\n\nHe slept a smaller sleep that did not feel cheated, and he woke before the alarm he did not set and the day after the day felt like a piece of bread someone had warmed just for him. He found Lila in the galley pouring tea as if pouring tea were an offensive art, and she handed him a cup without looking up and told him she had dreamt of feathers turning into noodles and he told her that meant the day would be good because noodles fill people in a way feathers don\u2019t. He checked the letter out of habit and put it away faster than he had yesterday because it was now a souvenir and not a guide, and he stood on deck with his hands braced and smelled a morning that had decided to be human.\n\nThere would be interviews to be bothered by, and a return to Bu Dewi\u2019s to be fed whether he agreed or not, and a visit from a boy who might bring a duck if the world had behaved, and a network of men with rings and wrists who had reconsidered their feathers. There would be a new job for Lila to refuse three times before deciding to accept on her own terms, and a set of security cameras to reteach to be honest, and a boss of some boys to be shown the place where rivers end as a lesson in humility. There would be, under all of it, the fact that his thumb remembered what ribbons feel like and his mouth remembered where to put its breath and his heart remembered how to let bells ring without thinking they were alarms. He took a sip of tea and let it scald the roof of his mouth a little because it felt correct, and then he turned to tell Lila a stupid joke he had been saving, and the boat leaned, attentive, to hear it.",
