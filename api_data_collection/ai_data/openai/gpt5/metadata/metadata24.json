     "novel_text": "Broken Arrow smells like brick dust and summer church potlucks. In the Rose District on a Friday night you can hear three different bands tuning three different wrong notes while the wind tries to convince you to go home. The bricks on Main carry heat into September, and people walk their dogs twice, once before sunset, once after, when the mosquitoes send smoke signals from the crepe myrtles. I\u2019m usually somewhere between the craft store that sells scented candles shaped like snow cones and the bar that pretends it\u2019s not a bar by offering hummus. I\u2019m usually somewhere between being someone and the punch line I\u2019ve been rehearsing about it.\n\nWhen you have to explain you\u2019re a comedian in Broken Arrow, you end up folding laundry a lot while you explain, because explaining and folding both make you look responsible. You make little rows of socks on a couch with a sinkhole in the middle and say, no, it\u2019s not just jokes. It\u2019s like\u2014storytelling, but with rhythm; it\u2019s like church but with swears; it\u2019s like sparring but you\u2019re the one both throwing and catching. Half the time you end up talking to someone who can\u2019t stay because they heard the 10 p.m. siren test is tonight (it isn\u2019t; it\u2019s always noon on Saturdays, but fear doesn\u2019t own a calendar). It\u2019s okay. I carry my own calendar in my throat.\n\nOnstage the light is close and bright and unflattering. It likes to show my pores and leave my eyes in shadow. It likes to make me a little ghostly, like I\u2019m borrowing a body I\u2019m not done paying for yet. I know exactly where to stand so I don\u2019t squeal into the speakers, and I grip the mic not like a lover or a weapon but like a handhold, like one of those barn handles you find on old doors at Reasor\u2019s when you think a bakery case might just roll open and reveal a better self.\n\nTonight, I talk about the way the giant cross on the highway is both comforting and threatening, like an ex who sends you recipes. I say, \u201cWe have more churches than stoplights and that math checks out \u2018cause every time I stop, someone\u2019s getting saved.\u201d People laugh in that cheap-seats way that tells you they want to laugh. I talk about QuikTrip, my second home, how the soda machines are a baptism if you mix them right, Dr Pepper and regret and just a splash of diet because maybe I\u2019m different now. I talk about growing up here, how the sky moves like a very slow animal, how the weather app is a horoscope with anxiety. People hunch forward and let me move inside their heads for a few minutes. I always put the furniture back where I found it.\n\nJune is at the back table, her elbow on the small wooden square like she\u2019s holding it down, like the table might float if she doesn\u2019t. June\u2019s hair is dark and has a mind that wandered off and never returned. She wears a shirt she stole from her sister, a faded navy thing with a hole near the hem that she pretends is a design feature. June laughs without forcing it, a little inward fall of sound, more breath than noise. She is my best friend, which is the easiest story to tell when the light asks a question. Onstage I call her my \u201caccomplice\u201d because it sounds less like falling.\n\nAfter the set I slide my palm under the mic stand\u2019s foot to keep it from biting me and set everything back in its upright and locked positions. The bartender gives me a nod that could mean I did a job or I did them a favor or that I exist. The light leaves without turning off and the room remembers it\u2019s a room.\n\n\u201cYou shaved, kind of,\u201d June says, when I get to her.\n\n\u201cThere was a razor in the house and it was time for our talk,\u201d I say. \u201cYou sat through the joke about the midi-length skirts of my youth. Again. I owe you a medal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou owe me a pretzel,\u201d she says. \u201cYou insulted my sister\u2019s church and the pretzel can be a crumbly apology.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretzel\u2019s on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe salt,\u201d she adds. \u201cI want extra. The salt\u2019s on you, too.\u201d\n\nWe walk out into the air that tastes like the back of a spoon. Broken Arrow at night makes a kind of stitched darkness, streetlamps sewing the thing together, and the brick glows because brick is dramatic like that. A man bikes past with a loaf of bread under his arm like a baton and no egg in the world will be safe tonight. We pass the plant shop where everything in the window looks like it could listen to you. It\u2019s early for us. We are late for people with babies.\n\nAt QuikTrip, the men in reflective vests stand in a small parliament near the coffee urns and discuss weather like weather is gossip. We order the pretzel, and I perform a minor miracle with the cheese cup, not spilling any while I pull the tray to the table we always pick, the one near the wall that pretends to be black tile.\n\nJune dips a bite and says, \u201cI love watching you be brave and also safe at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefine safe,\u201d I say, because it tickles.\n\n\u201cLike, you hold the railing with words. You stand close to the thing that won\u2019t hurt you so the thing that can is confused,\u201d she says. \u201cI envy that. I don\u2019t have that. I always take my hands off the bar right when the ride starts.\u201d\n\nWe have known each other for three years now. We met at a pottery class we both signed up for because someone\u2019s therapist\u2014hers? mine? does it matter?\u2014said it might help to make something with your hands. The room smelled like wet bread and floor cleaner, and the teacher, a thin man whose right shoulder was higher than his left shoulder, said: center your clay, center your breath, center whatever you\u2019re pretending you don\u2019t have to center. June\u2019s bowl became a plate became a flat circle became a gesture. My bowl stayed a bowl, heavy as a bad mood, and I made a joke about spooning my feelings, and June laughed like her lungs were surprised. After, we threw our pieces in the discard bin that the teacher, jovial, called \u201cthe democracy,\u201d and we went to QuikTrip, because QuikTrip is the only confession booth that takes debit.\n\nNow June licks salt from her thumb and her eyelids lower and lift in slow half-moon blinks. She\u2019s a potter still, or whatever the word is for someone who has a wheel in the garage that mostly holds other things but sometimes holds clay. The wheel came from a Craigslist ad that sounded like a breakup: \u201cNeeds a good home. Still works. Some scratches. It deserves better.\u201d She\u2019s been throwing more lately, and there are cups drying in her kitchen like a tiny congregation seeing if it can be faithful.\n\n\u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d she asks. The fluorescent lights do what fluorescent lights have always done, which is try very hard to be the sun and fail.\n\n\u201cOnly if I can tell you something back.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d she says. The salt crystals on the tray make constellations if you squint, which is how most constellations happened in the first place.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re getting better,\u201d she says. \u201cI know you hate that word. I know it\u2019s like telling a cloud it\u2019s doing a great job being a cloud. But I can see the timing shifting, like you moved your couch and suddenly you can breathe. Your breath, Rachele. Onstage it\u2019s yours tonight.\u201d\n\nI pretend to look at my phone because receiving kindness is not my talent. \u201cOkay my turn,\u201d I say. \u201cI saw your cups. The small blue one? You got the lip right. I don\u2019t know what makes a lip right, but whatever it is you wrestled it to the ground and you are standing on its throat.\u201d\n\nShe snorts and covers her mouth. \u201cGod.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not apologize for metaphor violence,\u201d I say, solemn. \u201cNot in this QuikTrip. Not while the roller grill dreams of becoming food.\u201d\n\nWe eat in the way that friends do when they have run out of stories about other people. The world is in the corner of my eye, doing its juggling. A teenager with a basketball under the counter asks for cigarettes he cannot have. A woman in scrubs buys agua fresca and a scratch ticket and a sigh. The door sussurra, lets in a new piece of night.\n\nI love June the way you love a song you can\u2019t sing along to yet because you don\u2019t know it, not in your mouth. I love June the way midsummer loves a thunderhead, suspicious and plain and wanting. I put my hands near it and then remember I am electricity and also a person, and I pull back. Instead I keep feeding it tiny coins of admiration and jokes, hoping one day the machine vends something I can name.\n\nWe leave when a group of teenagers colonize the chairs and start throwing napkins like flags. Out in the parking lot, a pickup slides past with a dog in the passenger seat sitting like he\u2019s late for a meeting. The amber light at the edge of the lot makes everything look like it might be in a memory.\n\nJune goes to her car and pulls on the door like it\u2019s pretending not to know her. There is a sound of plastic disagreeing with plastic. \u201cDon\u2019t judge my door,\u201d she says when it finally opens. \u201cIt\u2019s had a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would never judge your door,\u201d I say. \u201cI only judge your Playlist of Sad Women With Banjo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t sad,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re precise.\u201d\n\nShe drives a tan Camry with a bumper sticker that says Support Your Local Library and a small chip on the windshield that looks like a comma, as if the road asked her to pause. When she pulls out, she looks left, right, left again, like the manual taught her, like the manual was a god. She drives with both hands, ten and two, as if the car could slip out of her fingers at any second. I used to think that was cute. Now I think everything she does is a small letter to the future in case the future wants to reply.\n\n\u201cFerris wheel?\u201d she asks, one hand out her window, catching the air in its palm like it could hold it. The small traveling carnival set up a week ago on the edge of Elm Place, for fundraising something or other and the Ferris wheel is older than my father\u2019s truck and a miracle that refuses to learn about load-bearing beams.\n\n\u201cI have to write,\u201d I say, and it\u2019s true, and also the Ferris wheel makes my stomach test me. \u201cAlso I promised my mom I\u2019d stop riding things that were assembled by men named Ron in shorts.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon in shorts,\u201d she says, like a poem\u2019s first line. \u201cWe\u2019ll go tomorrow and I\u2019ll make fun of you from below.\u201d\n\nI want to say come over. I want to say I bought blueberries and forgot why. I want to say I want to fall asleep with the sound of your dishwasher like a small river I\u2019m allowed to cross. Instead, I wave like people wave in cars, like the movement could be a shield. She pulls away, and brake lights stain the asphalt for a second, and then night returns to its default setting.\n\nHome is a third floor apartment with two windows that fight about light. The ceilings are high not because the building wants to be generous but because someone mismeasured something. The carpet was beige once and now is committed to a complicated neutrality. My couch is a gray you can find in any therapist\u2019s office if you dig. The bookshelf wobbles and my landlord insists the wobble is part of the charm, as if gravity is a personality trait. I know the names of the crickets by the balcony because we share the hours. They keep time for me. I set my notebook on the coffee table and the coffee table pretends that was always its meaning.\n\nI write in long loops. I talk to myself in a voice that doesn\u2019t always like me. I make lists as if the lists can forgive me. I circle words and uncircle them. I try to put the air from QuikTrip into the paper, the way the woman in scrubs looked like a secret she was keeping, the way June\u2019s thumb was a small planet collecting salt. Sometimes I think if I just name everything carefully enough, the world will calm down. Name and tame\u2014a rhyme I should be more suspicious of.\n\nWhen I don\u2019t write, I walk. Not like the long day will vanish if I outpace it, but like walking is the opposite of erasing. I walk down to the skate park where small boys fly past like they got a memo about gravity and have chosen to respond creatively. I walk past the old train car they shoved near the museum, a thing that never moved again but still looks like it might if you looked away. I walk the parking lot of the church where my mother sings alto in a choir robe that makes her look like herself and not a substitute teacher. I walk to sleep, sometimes, and if sleep refuses, I carry on without her.\n\nMy mother calls at eleven and says, \u201cI watched that clip you sent.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom,\u201d I say, and sit down on the floor because her voice is a room with a different gravity. \u201cWas it too much? The thing about communion crackers? I can cut that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was bright,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was sharp. You have grown into yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stole that exact sentence for a joke about puberty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou steal from me all the time,\u201d she says, and I hear her smile because you can. \u201cYour grandma would have loved to argue with you about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould I have won?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says softly, \u201cbut you would have sharpened each other like knives, and that would have been a kind of love. How is June.\u201d\n\nShe always says it like that, like June is a status you order from a menu, medium rare.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s good. She\u2019s throwing,\u201d I say. \u201cCups this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw one on the Instagram. The lip was very elegant. Is she seeing anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe sees me all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cMhm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom,\u201d I say, slow as if the syllable might be the right shape. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not doing anything. I am stirring soup,\u201d she says. \u201cYou tell your jokes and I will stir my soup, and one of us is allowed to be a mother about it. Your father is building a shelf.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe cannot trick the wall into holding it,\u201d I say. \u201cThe wall knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wall is stubborn. It\u2019s where you get it. You were a stubborn baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a principled baby,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\nAfter we hang up, I watch a video of a woman making sourdough with a voiceover like rain. I wash my face and am startled, as always, that my face remains, committed to the job. I lie down and the ceiling hums. The night comes in through the small slit in the blinds like a note someone pushed under the door.\n\nMorning isn\u2019t new in Oklahoma. It\u2019s a second draft. The light is already edited. I make coffee that tastes like a very clean apology and open my notebook to the page where I scrawled dreams: a snake made of ribbon and a man I think was my fifth grade math teacher except he was a tree. I write these down because I promised a therapist once that I would try to respect the weird.\n\nJune texts at 9: a photo of a cup with a small wobble. \u201cThis one is like your laugh,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt keeps wanting to tip into a different joke.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou take that back,\u201d I text, and send a picture of my coffee mug, chipped on the lip, the chip I always forget until it cuts my mouth like a friend making a point. \u201cThis is me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlueberries are on sale,\u201d she replies. \u201cWe can become baker women who sing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are not sad,\u201d I type. \u201cThey are precise.\u201d\n\nShe sends a voice memo of her own laugh. I play it three times. It\u2019s the exact length of a heartbeat if your heart is trying to be sneaky.\n\nThe day is a rehearsal. I go to the grocery store and argue with tomatoes. I pick the line with the woman who will tell me about her child\u2019s soccer practice, because I like to hear about things I cannot fix. I stop by the library and touch the spines of books like they might touch me back. I go to the small studio where a man lets me hold a hand drum and pretend rhythm likes me. At noon, the tornado siren tests. It is a sound that makes time expand, a pressure in your head like weather has an opinion about your bones. Everyone ignores it like professionals. Everyone still looks up.\n\nAt five I let my brain do nothing in a parking lot. At six I go to the coffee shop that sells paintings of birds with eyes too human. I run my set in my head and then again in my mouth like mouth rehearsal is different. It is. Rehearsal lives in the body, not the plan.\n\nAt seven June texts. \u201cI\u2019m outside,\u201d she says. \u201cI brought the good gum.\u201d\n\nShe leans against her car like she and the car have chosen each other for now and are committed to doing the work. She has an orange in her pocket and the orange wants to be seen. We peel it before we go in and our hands smell like we went to a better place.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re wearing the jacket,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cThis is the jacket,\u201d she says. It\u2019s the denim one with the soft places where soft places matter, the elbows, the back. It\u2019s the jacket that says I live here. \u201cI want you to do the joke about the tornado drill.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just wrote the new tags.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to hear the new tags live.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what faith is,\u201d I say, and she rolls her eyes because she grew up in a house where the word faith has a shelf.\n\nTonight the bar is less of a bar because a group of church women from a nearby Bible study has decided to stay late and \u201ctry the craft beer.\u201d They look like an early morning I could love. The host gives them small cups like toddlers, and one of the women says, \u201cHoppy?\u201d like it is an accusation. They bless themselves with laughter.\n\nWhen I go up, June is in the place she always is, a little to the left. The light pretends it knows me now. I talk about the way tornado drills taught us to become furniture, to turn our backs to the glass because we didn\u2019t deserve to watch the storm want us. I talk about Okies at the grocery store when the weather decides to pretend we are endangered, all of us buying milk like that will tether the house. I talk about my father, who builds a shelf when anxious. The women from the Bible study laugh and gasp and two clap on the wrong beats and I feel enormous affection for them.\n\nHalfway through the set I make a joke about the road. I say the BA Expressway is a river and we are all paddling with paper plates. I say the way we merge is a spiritual exercise, a willingness to be seen and not crash. I mention drivers who treat turn signals like declarations of war. June\u2019s head tilts like she\u2019s learning something she thought she already knew.\n\nAfter, a man stops me to say I said something he needed. He doesn\u2019t know what it is but he needed it. He has tears he does not want to have and I offer him a napkin like I am in charge. June buys me an iced tea and we sit on the window ledge like teenagers with nowhere to be.\n\n\u201cYou OK?\u201d I say to the man\u2019s receding back because I am a late person, always arriving after the moment arrived.\n\nJune stands and stretches like a tall thought. \u201cLet\u2019s walk,\u201d she says, and my bones say yes before I make a face. We walk down Main where the brick argues with concrete and lose the sound of the bar quickly to the sound of us. The air is thick but not mean. The lamps are practicing being stars.\n\nWe pass a group of kids taking pictures in front of the mural with the big roses and the word LOVE in letters too wide. They pose like they\u2019ve seen people pose on places that tell you how to pose. I try to see the space like I saw it at thirteen, when I thought everything large was proof.\n\n\u201cDo you ever want to go?\u201d June asks, and it\u2019s the way she asks when what she means is leave, not, do you want to go to the Ferris wheel now. \u201cLike, do you ever want to sell your couch and declare your house a museum and just go?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to go all the time,\u201d I say. \u201cI want to go and I want to stay and I want both things so much I forget to do either.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought about Tulsa,\u201d she says, which is our version of Paris. \u201cJust to see. Or maybe the place with the cliffs. Or a coast, a different wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be enormous somewhere else,\u201d I say, and it comes out more tender than I planned. \u201cThis place keeps you small because it knows you. Somewhere else would have to measure again.\u201d\n\nShe bumps my shoulder with hers, which is how she says thank you when thank you is too loud. We stop at the edge of the small city park where the grass is considerate and the trees, planted by a committee, haven\u2019t decided on a mood.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think I should fall in love with someone sensible,\u201d she says, and the way she doesn\u2019t look at me is a kind of looking. \u201cLike a man who decides what to do with numbers. I should hand him my chaos and watch him stack it neatly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I met a man who could do that I\u2019d marry him first,\u201d I say, and the joke lays there obediently, waiting for the room to catch up. She laughs, the laugh I saved from the memo, and it flickers through me. I want to say, I am not sensible but I am faithful. I want to say, give me your chaos in a paper bag with a grease stain and I will wear it like a hat and we\u2019ll call it a day. I want to say, I baked those blueberries. I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t bake. The oven is a metaphor I distrust.\n\nInstead I say, \u201cYou deserve good mistakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so tired already,\u201d she says, and leans her head on my shoulder for a wild second, and we stare at the grass that has decided to be exactly what it is. Then she stands up straight like a student being called on. \u201cFerris wheel?\u201d she asks again, and it\u2019s a way of asking, do you want to do something dangerous but small.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d I promise. \u201cI have a date with a blank page, and the blank page is late and mean.\u201d\n\nShe drives me home. My building\u2019s stairwell smells like someone who once made chili and thinks it\u2019s still going on. We sit in the car with the engine a small animal under the hood, warm and needing.\n\n\u201cDo you ever think about\u2026\u201d she says, and stops.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, because I do, about everything, about the way the streetlight makes her cheek a soft coin, about the way my hands know how to be still and don\u2019t want to be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make you a bowl,\u201d she says instead, a change of subject that isn\u2019t a change. \u201cA bowl so heavy you have to use two hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike dignity,\u201d she says. \u201cLike soup for the end of the world.\u201d\n\nI go upstairs and sit on the floor and lean against the couch and the air comes in my lungs and goes. I practice saying things to the empty room. I practice not saying things. The crickets take their positions and the highway hums, far away and always near. Sleep finds me not because I am ready but because it has to, like a bus route. I ride it to morning.\n\nThe next day starts clean as paper. June sends me a photo of a bowl that is imperfect and holy. I send her a joke about storms. We promise to meet at seven at the Ferris wheel, to go up and look at our small city from the top, to wave at the church steeples and say we live here and it is enough.\n\nBefore then, there is the day. There are the errands and the texts and the small tragedies of ordinary hours. I read a poem and forget it and then remember the exact word \u201ccattail\u201d when I pass the drainage ditch. I see a woman teaching her child to ride a bike and the child\u2019s body is outrage and grace at once. I drink water and pretend it is medicinal. I stand too long in a doorway, thinking. I watch a man move a piano with three other men and a rope that I don\u2019t trust, and everything in me makes a sound.\n\nI do my set again, small and tight in the mirror. I listen to the radio because the radio is the only place someone\u2019s voice can change the day. A song about dust makes me tear up at a stop sign. I talk myself down. I call my mother to hear her tidy a drawer with words.\n\nAt six-thirty I leave, because I am a person who is not late for Ferris wheels; those are not the rides you want to rush. The sun is lower now and throws the world in relief. Moths already plan their mistakes. I drive past fields that are not fields, past houses that used to be houses. The air feels like it could crack or heal. Both are options. I am always driving through a choice.\n\nMy phone buzzes at a red light. June: \u201cRunning late. Ten minutes.\u201d The message has a typo, the word running without the second n. It\u2019s the kind of small human mistake that always makes me love us. I send her a thumbs up that pretends to be adequate.\n\nI get there and the wheel turns and turns, a slow idea against the sky. People line up and don\u2019t pretend to be patient. Kids attack the air with sugar. The woman with the cash box takes my money like she\u2019s known me a thousand years and she has. The ground under my shoes is the kind of ground you only find in places meant to be temporary\u2014pressed, uncertain, trying.\n\nI stand by the fence and practice breathing like there\u2019s a correct way. The light around everything is honey on a spoon, reluctant to let go. I imagine the top of the wheel, the way the town will look like a plan someone wrote down and kept. I imagine pointing at the library roof and saying, there. I imagine June\u2019s hand on the cool metal of the carriage, how she would make a joke about creaks, how I would pretend not to be scared. I imagine telling her a truth and not regretting it immediately.\n\nI check my phone again. \u201cOn my way,\u201d she writes. A car door slams somewhere. The wheel creaks. A little boy in a Spiderman shirt says loudly that he could jump it if he had to, and his mother says please don\u2019t, and he nods a nod that is also a plan.\n\nSomeone laughs. Someone curses, softly, in that local way where cursing is flavor not heat. Someone drops a popcorn bucket and collects the pieces and makes popcorn out of the pieces anyway because waste is a luxury.\n\nI stand there and wait, like a person in a story who hasn\u2019t learned her story yet. The light lowers. The town breathes. Seven becomes seven-ten becomes seven-twenty. June\u2019s car is not here. My phone is silent. I imagine every wrong turn. I imagine a line at the light. I imagine her stopping to look at a hawk like we do, like both of us believe hawks are omens, even on normal days.\n\nThe man with the cash box tells me how many tickets there are left because he thinks I\u2019m nervous about scarcity. I smile and say I\u2019m waiting for someone, and he says, \u201cAren\u2019t we all,\u201d and I smile the kind of smile you give when you know you\u2019re in a line bigger than the one in front of you.\n\nWhen my phone finally buzzes, it\u2019s not a text. It\u2019s a call. And it\u2019s a voice that doesn\u2019t know me, that knows my number from somewhere else, from a screen in a pocket, from a distance, and it says my name like it\u2019s asking permission to use it, and the world folds in the middle but does not break, not yet. The Ferris wheel turns like it promised. The lights along the spokes flash red, then blue, then white, then nothing like an eyelid trying to focus. A moth wings itself against my cheek and the small dust it leaves is everything I have left in that second, and I hold completely still and then I move. I\u2019m already walking. I don\u2019t know which way yet, but my body does, and I let it, I let it tell the street what it knows before my brain does, and the town looks like my hands when I\u2019m cold, all knuckle and ache, and I go.The voice says my name like it doesn\u2019t belong to me yet and asks if I know a June with dark hair and a denim jacket and a car that looks like a sentence that hasn\u2019t decided how to end. I say yes, more than yes, and the voice says there\u2019s been a thing, a small thing that isn\u2019t small, a kiss between bumpers that turned into a shove. He says she\u2019s awake, he says she said my number first, he says they\u2019re taking her to St. John Broken Arrow because that is the hospital the ambulance knows by heart. He tells me which corner to avoid because traffic has decided to turn into theater and the audience is impatient, and when I say I\u2019m coming, the word \u201ccoming\u201d feels like a muscle I forgot I had.\n\nBy the time I reach my car I find I\u2019m already moving with the surety you get when there are no options, only momentum. My keys make that dumb chime like the car is flirting, and I tell the dashboard out loud to please pay attention, like electronics respond to tone. The turn out of the lot is a needle through fabric, and the world comes in fast, broken into frames by the streetlights. I pass the Ferris wheel, which has moved from romance to satire in a single minute, and it watches me go with all its eyes. The light on Elm is red and then not; the road becomes a tongue, rough and familiar, and I am the word trying to arrive. I don\u2019t know why my brain decides to notice the teenager in a hoodie pushing a bike uphill, the way he leans into it like he believes in friction, but it is here with me, along with the smell of frying oil escaping a truck bed and the way brake lights make a grammar on pavement I understand without translation.\n\nWhen the intersection appears it is a story told wrong. The trees on the corner are pretending to mind their own business, but everyone in town knows, because everyone in town has slowed to watch, and this is a kind of prayer we practice even when we say we don\u2019t. The Camry is on the shoulder under a convinced streetlamp, and it still looks like itself, which makes my knees threateningly negotiable. The comma in the windshield has become a sentence fragment, spreading like a thought you tried not to think. A paramedic in navy and competence asks me who I am and when I say \u201chers,\u201d he nods in a way that translates into a little space where I can see June, propped and watching everything like it owes her a reason.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d she says in that breathy stage whisper people use when the stage is a gurney. \u201cI am sorry I stood you up. The airbag had plans for my face.\u201d She gestures with her eyes because her hands are doing their own choreography with straps and blood pressure cuffs, and there is a cut above her eyebrow that looks like a new constellation, and she is very, very June, which means she is making it easier for me even though I don\u2019t deserve it.\n\n\u201cYou would cancel a date with God if there was new laundry,\u201d I say, and her grin is a thing that rearranges the night. The nametag on the paramedic reads RON, because sometimes the universe likes its own jokes, and he tells me they are taking her in to keep her for a bit because her head is insisting it\u2019s fine and they don\u2019t believe heads. He says cracked radius maybe, and bruising, and her pulse is a drum with manners, and I nod as if nodding is a useful profession. I sign something with a pen that has touched too many panicked hands, and I say, like an idiot, \u201cCan she have gum,\u201d and Ron smiles with his eyes and says no gum in the ambulance, ma\u2019am, and I hate the ma\u2019am because it recognizes me and I love it because I want the world to be heavy with adults who know what to do.\n\nThe ambulance leaves like a punctuation mark and I follow it without outrunning common sense. The BA Expressway opens its throat and lets me in, and I\u2019ve never been so grateful for its brutal clarity, the way it gives you a straight line and dares you to misuse it. The giant cross at the megachurch exit is lit like an idea that refuses to sleep, and in this light it is exactly as confusing as I always say, both movie prop and compass. I think about how many times I\u2019ve made fun of the way we drive around here, and how the jokes were always a way to put my hands somewhere, a railing I could hold while the ride pretends to be wild. The siren ahead of me is a thread through fabric, pulling us toward something that is both answer and question, and when it cuts left under a sign that says Emergency it feels like we have been chosen for a team I didn\u2019t know we were trying out for.\n\nSt. John at night is a clean mouth. It smells like mint and the kind of lemon that is really just an idea of lemon, and there are women behind counters who have seen everyone in their ugliest hour and keep greeting the next person as if this is the first time they have ever watched someone arrive full of the need to be forgiven by the present. \u201cRelationship,\u201d the registrar asks, and I hate the ranginess of that word, the way it wants me to stand in a shape that might not be respected by a printer. I say friend because English has not given me a better word I can say in this foyer without melting, and she accepts it like a check that will cash. The pen on its little chain winks at me, and all the forms ask if June is allergic to peanuts and penicillin and hope, and I write no about all the things I know she can handle, and I leave blank the spaces where I don\u2019t know, because I refuse to lie to paperwork even when it is kind.\n\nThe waiting room has chairs in colors that are trying to be calm and a television tuned to a travel show where a man with a beard eats something messy and nods as if he understands a place because his mouth is full. There is the requisite woman knitting something that can forgive your wrists, and a man whose foot jiggles to a beat only he hears, and a nurse at a desk whose posture suggests she is holding the ceiling up with her spine. I sit in a place that feels like a corner without being one and discover that sitting is a verb that asks for cooperation from your heart. I text June\u2019s sister because there are vows we make without saying them and one of them is that you do not let sisters find out from the wind, and I write the words carefully like I am placing them under her door. \u201cShe\u2019s okay,\u201d I type and delete and type again because I have learned that telling people someone is okay when they are inside a medical building is like promising the weather; it is a kindness that can hit you later. I call my mother because I am now the child asking for the soup of her voice, and she answers in the way that lets me be older and younger at once, and when she says she and her choir will pray like they mean it, I believe in their breath like a quilt.\n\nIn the fourth hour of the longest minute, a doctor with a haircut like a decision comes out and says words that stop shaking almost immediately, because he is good at his work and his work includes steadiness. Concussion, he says, like a word we all know from a pamphlet, and a hairline fracture in the left radius, and bruising where life insisted upon itself too hard. He says she was lucky to be wearing her seatbelt like this is a new sacrament and I should make a note. He says they will keep her overnight because brains are drama queens who need to be humored, and tomorrow they will decide what kind of cast June gets to live with. He says I can see her because she asked for the person with the laugh that breaks in the middle, and I recognize myself even when described by someone else\u2019s listening.\n\nJune is in a room that pretends to be a room and is really a diagram of safety. There are rails on the bed like we have reached a place in the world where the bed itself needs help being a bed, and the monitor glows in the corner like someone\u2019s idea of a town. Her face is a new topography with medical tape like small bridges, and she smiles the exact smile from the parking lot after a show when someone insists on telling me about their cousin\u2019s bar mitzvah, which is to say she manages to make a space where this is not the worst thing. \u201cFerris wheel rain check,\u201d she says, and her voice plays at normal and only flinches once at the word wheel.\n\n\u201cI got you the deluxe package,\u201d I say, and hold up the hospital cup of water with a straw like it is priceless and we both know plastic is the only substance that lives forever. She gestures vaguely toward her left and winces only to keep me honest, and I pull the blanket up because there is nothing in the world more useful than rearranging fabric when you can\u2019t rearrange anything else. \u201cYou look like you fought a small handsome bird and won,\u201d I say, and she giggles, which makes the monitor add punctuation to our conversation, and I\u2019d marry that ridiculous little beep if it asked.\n\nWe talk about the stupidest things because the stupidest things can carry weight without bending. She tells me about the man who ran across two lanes to lean into her window and hold her gaze while he told her which way was up, and she says he smelled like motor oil and generosity and she trusts that combination because her father fixed things more than he hugged them. I tell her about the woman at the front desk with the rhinestone pen who said she liked my earrings like she was pinning me to the map, and I admit I almost cried in the gift shop at the sight of a plush possum wearing a stethoscope, because the world has no idea how close it always is to ridiculous. She dozes and wakes and asks for the time and makes a face when I say it and says, \u201cThis was not the miracle I ordered,\u201d and I say, \u201cDelivery services are unreliable,\u201d and she rolls her eyes and the roll is the gentlest thing I\u2019ve ever seen someone do.\n\nThere is a moment when she is mostly asleep and the monitors have decided to trust her, and I hold her hand in the way you do with people who prefer to be reminded rather than rescued. Her fingers are warm and unbroken and freckles invent themselves across her knuckles like punctuation in a poem, and I think of the bowl she promised me, the heavy one, and how some things can only be held with both hands if you want to honor them. I consider telling her the thing I practice telling the wall, the thing about wanting her near me in ways I don\u2019t even know how to catalog, but I also consider the timing and the abundance of tubes and the oxygen sensor clipped to her finger like a nightlight that refuses to go off, and I decide lust is brave but love can be patient. The chair at the side of the bed is the kind of chair dreamed up by people who hate chairs, but I fold myself into it and let my spine write new alphabets because being here is easier than being anywhere else.\n\nAt two in the morning the world becomes a hallway, and I meet it for coffee like you meet a person you dated once and decided to keep friendly. The vending machine offers choices that are not choices and I feed it a dollar like an offering to a fickle god. I end up with something that claims to be a lemon cookie and tastes like a meeting, and I eat it anyway because this is not a night that requires standards. There is a nurse who moves like a metronome, and her badge says TIFFANY even though she is fifty-five and older than the pearl I imagine in the necklace she refuses to take off, and she tells me quietly that June looks good, that she likes the way June\u2019s numbers behave when the room is bored. This phrase, the room is bored, sits down with me like a friend I didn't know I needed, and I imagine the room itself as a patient, needing us to be either interesting or stable, and tonight we have chosen stable, and tonight I owe the room a snack.\n\nJune\u2019s sister calls me back at a time of night that makes apologies into crows, sharp and unnecessary. She says she didn\u2019t hear the text because she was cutting out paper stars for her niece\u2019s school project, and the way she says stars lets me forgive every sharp thing I\u2019ve ever thought about her correctional style of love. We talk about logistics because logistics allow you to move your heart around the map without the heart realizing you\u2019ve left it behind. I tell her I\u2019m here and in love with the beep and she says she will come in the morning with socks because hospital socks are either a religion or a threat and we all have preferences, and she thanks me in the voice of a woman who is surprised to need someone and pleasantly baffled to find they were already there.\n\nAt four I walk down to the lobby to remind my body what distance feels like, and on impulse, or on muscle memory, or on the trajectory of a person who has been here before in other shapes, I go across the street to a QuikTrip that is practicing being quiet. The men in reflective vests are not in parliament because parliament sleeps eventually, but there is a single man with a newspaper folded into a language you can turn into a hat, and an older woman pouring coffee who says \u201cGood morning\u201d to me like it\u2019s a dare. I get a pretzel because something circular is required and condiments are control, and I sit for a minute under the fluorescent lights that are trying out new names. I think about June\u2019s hands in clay, the way she finds center not by forcing it but by negotiating, and I try to center myself around nothing, and it goes about as well as negotiations when both parties are stubborn and identical.\n\nBack in the room, the hospital is wrapped in the kind of quiet that still has edges. The windows let in a softness that wants to be morning, and I take the chair again because it has forgiven me. June sleeps with her mouth doing that small thing mouths do when they are busy being a body instead of a person, and I think about all the mouths she keeps, the one she uses with kids at the pottery classes she started teaching on Tuesdays when the radiators hiss and the wheel makes a sound like a child shushing itself, the one she uses with her sister when they pretend not to be the same person in two different decades, the one she uses with me, full of compromises and little fairs where I get to win prizes if I listen closely. I let my eyes close because my eyes are fragile littles who will misbehave if not given their nap, and I sleep there with my hand on the bed in the way people put their palms on the hoods of cars to feel the engine still warm, to believe in the evidence of heat.\n\nWhen I wake, it is because dawn has decided it is time for the city to remember we are alive. The narrow slice of sky I\u2019m allowed through the window blushes with a color makeup counters call something like coral promise, and the BA Expressway hums its locust song and has the audacity to be almost beautiful. The nurse with the pearl necklace brings in a tray with a plastic dome that has the self-esteem of an astronaut helmet, and June blinks at me from under her lashes like a person rejoining a conversation she never agreed to leave. \u201cSo the Ferris wheel,\u201d she says, and it feels miraculous that we still live in a world where this sentence can take up space.\n\n\u201cWe will wait until it forgets we owe it money and then we will ride it twice,\u201d I say, and she says, \u201cTwice?\u201d and I say, \u201cOnce for me and once for the part of me that didn\u2019t get on,\u201d and she laughs and then winces and then laughs at her own wincing because being human is very layered if you let it be. She eats three bites of hospital eggs that are eggs in the way a paper boat is a boat, and she declares herself a conqueror and lets me tuck the blanket again and I feel useful in a way the stage has never gotten me, which is inconvenient, to be honest.\n\nAt some point my phone tells me someone from last night\u2019s show posted a clip of me talking about tornado drills and there are comments from people I don\u2019t know saying the joke made them think about the glass they turn their backs to, and I want to go and delete the whole world and also invite them here to sit in a hospital chair and see what it means to turn toward, but I settle for a heart emoji and a promise to myself that I will not write anything I don\u2019t believe while my bones are tired. My mother texts a photo of my father holding a level like a relic and a shelf he has convinced a wall to respect, and she has added the caption \u201cStubbornness: a family heirloom,\u201d and I would like to kiss them both on their foreheads and tuck them into a shoebox labeled Persons Who Can Be Counted On.\n\nThere is a flurry of scrubs in the hall and a cheerful tech named Marisol who bends the whole day toward her smile. She wraps plaster and says things like almost there and this is going to be your temporary beautiful, and June watches her arm become a statement and says, \u201cIt\u2019s like a bracelet that means it,\u201d and Marisol says, \u201cYes, exactly, a bracelet with boundaries,\u201d and I love them enough to loan them my car. June has to pee and I become a person who helps people pee and I do it like I was born to it, and later, when she is back in the bed, she says, \u201cThank you for not narrating,\u201d and I say, \u201cI narrate for a living, I know when to let the scene breathe,\u201d and she says, \u201cYou are insufferable,\u201d and I say, \u201cCorrect,\u201d and this feels like the most honest exchange the hospital has hosted all morning.\n\nBy midday she is set free with a list of instructions that reads like a spell, and I sit with her while the nurse explains anti-nausea medicine in a tone that suggests she knows I\u2019m going to forget and call anyway. We leave with a bouquet of plastic containers and the sort of stern promises we make to strangers because we plan to break them to friends. The sunlight in the parking lot is the kind that has no use for metaphor, and I help her into my car, and she carefully arranges her body like a game of Tetris where the shapes have opinions. The seatbelt crosses her chest and she looks at it like a new religion and I consider joining, and together we drive through our city like we didn\u2019t plan on doing this today and are grateful to be allowed.\n\nAt her apartment I carry the bag the hospital gives everybody, the one that looks like a reusable grocery bag but feels like a white flag, and I open her front door with the key I have because we have arranged our lives around trust. The air inside smells like Thursday even though it is not, and the wheel in her garage sits like an animal that has been told to stay. I help her to the couch that is honest about what it has been through, and she finds a pillow for her left arm and then finds a better pillow and then finally picks the first pillow, and I put the glass of water on the right side because I have learned from experience about this particular gravity. We draw the blinds halfway because our eyes are relatives with opposing politics, and I sit on the floor with my back against her couch and open my notebook because sometimes the only way through an event is to make it earn its rent.\n\nShe closes her eyes and then opens them because she has something to say and does not trust it to stay if she waits. \u201cWhen the man leaned in and told me which way was up,\u201d she says, \u201cthe only thing I could think was, my mother would be proud that I did not panic. Isn\u2019t that stupid?\u201d She says it like she is throwing out compost that will probably turn into something useful if we\u2019re patient.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s precise,\u201d I say, and we lie there with precision like a third person in the room, small and necessary and occasionally insufferable. There is a blue shadow on the carpet that can only be made by the exact tilt of light through the slit of the blinds, and our city hums in a register only my bones can hear. Her breath evens out and I write the sentence: It is a privilege to be present for everything someone is trying to become. I write it twice because repeating makes it truer, and then I scratch it out because I am not writing for the audience today, I am writing for the machine that turns experience into the next right thing.\n\nIn the late afternoon we both sleep as if we are getting away with something. When we wake, we eat the blueberries with our hands out of the plastic clam shell because no bowl yet deserves them. We sit in our socks and watch a cooking show where everyone cries about onions and this seems like an appropriate compromise with the universe. When the light goes pink as a scraped knee, June says, \u201cNot tonight,\u201d and I say, \u201cNo, not tonight,\u201d and we share that promise like a roll at a table we finally feel we were invited to. Tomorrow I will make calls to insurance agents who believe in apocalypse more than humor, and I will stand in line at the pharmacy and make up backstories for everyone else who stands there with their small white bags, and I will drive made-of-jello slow past the intersection where the town took a breath and learned to hold it.\n\nFor now, the city softens around us like bread in a warm room. I say, without looking at her because sometimes the eyes get in the way, that we owe ourselves the top of the wheel, and she says, without looking at me because sometimes the eyes are impatient, that we will go when the man with the cash box has forgotten our faces and the moths have moved on to some other flame. We construct tomorrow out of the modest shapes available, and if the room gets bored we will tell it a joke. We will tell it about a cross that looks like a threat and a recipe and how a woman with a cast can still hold a railing with her words. We will tell it about a bowl heavy enough to require both hands and a city light enough to forgive us for not riding the ride on time, and somewhere under all of it there will be a beep, and we will let it keep time because we still plan to dance.The day after we don\u2019t ride the Ferris wheel teaches me the patience of paperwork. Insurance is a whispering chorus that refuses to harmonize, and I pace my living room trying to keep my voice in the key of polite. A woman in another time zone asks me to describe the \u201cincident\u201d and I do, carefully and without adjectives, like adjectives could make it worse. She tells me about a claim number that feels like a phone number I\u2019ll never call again, and I write it in my notebook next to a doodle of a circle with teeth. When I hang up I call the pharmacy because bureaucracy enjoys relay races, and a man with the voice of a high school bass clarinet tells me June\u2019s prescription will be ready \u201cin twenty to forty,\u201d and I ask, twenty to forty what, and he says \u201cYou know,\u201d and I do, because time in waiting rooms bends like a straw. The light in my apartment insists on being honest and my plants, anemically loyal, tilt toward it like a set of congregants who keep forgiving the sermon. I put on shoes because the day is a door that won\u2019t open unless you knock with your feet, and I go to June\u2019s to check the way her cast sits with her arm, the way the apartment sits with this new season. I bring a small bag of groceries, things that can be eaten with one hand, sandwiches that resemble strategy, a handful of nectarines because softness should be scheduled.\n\nJune has learned the weight of the cast the way you learn the weight of a new truth, by constantly bumping into it. She has tied a dish towel at the crook of her elbow like a flag that announces her left side is under construction. There is a bruise traveling down from the cut on her eyebrow like a river that decided to leave the mountain and visit the valley, and her face contains both apology and triumph, which is to say the day contains both of us. We practice the choreography of lowering and raising; we fold blankets like we have become our own grandparents. The wheel in the garage hums every time someone opens the back door, and I feel the itch in June\u2019s fingers that cannot go the way they\u2019re used to going. She briefs me on the cast\u2019s personality\u2014it hates tight sleeves, it hates door frames, it loves to be admired\u2014and I admire it properly, from several angles, like art that might be a weapon. \u201cWait until it itches,\u201d she says, a future tense that steals my breath for a second, because there is a specific kind of helplessness involved in not being allowed to scratch.\n\nAt the pharmacy, the late afternoon is a line that forgets how to move. An old man holds a paper bag like a newborn bird and tells anyone who will listen that he stopped eating grapefruit after it tried to assassinate his blood pressure. The clerk calls out names like a teacher taking attendance on the first day. I look down at the floor tiles and realize they are not straight and then cannot unsee it. When it\u2019s my turn the bass clarinet hands me June\u2019s orange bottles like they are trophies I won for endurance. I buy a cheap bouquet for the small victory of it and debate the greeting cards because there isn\u2019t a category called \u201cCongratulations on surviving someone else\u2019s mistake, also you are breathtaking with a bruise.\u201d I settle for blank and fill it with lines I will cross out three times before letting them live, and a drawing of a cast with a halo because sanctifying the inconvenient is a family sport.\n\nThat night I do a short set in a room that doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything but a room with a microphone. There are twelve people including the bartender and a woman knitting something that will save ankles in winter. I think about trying the bit about hospitals\u2014the way the monitors flirt with you and how every paper cup feels like a promise you can keep\u2014but the words wear bandages in my mouth and I don\u2019t have the right scissors. I stay with QuikTrip and the giant cross and the way we merge like we are practicing for a group project, and the laughs come in that tender middle register that means people have brought their hearts with them and are not pretending to sit with their coats. Afterward a man with hands like windshield wipers says his wife was in SAINT FRANCIS last month and he liked the eggs there, and I tell him I\u2019m adding hospital egg reviews to my set, and he says I better not because food service sued his niece once, and we both smile like we\u2019re new to language.\n\nWhen I get to June\u2019s, there is a blue bowl on the coffee table with a note under it that reads, \u201cPrototype for yours. Not heavy enough yet.\u201d The bowl wobbles slightly when I touch it, like it remembers when it was water. June sleeps with her mouth open in a way that makes me want to guard the door. Her arm is propped on a small tower of folded towels like a princess\u2019s mattress, and the cast is already smudged with her life\u2014graphite, a little flour, a fingerprint from a sauce that might be tomato or courage. I sit beside her and watch whatever cooking show the remote gave me, a French woman wearing an apron like armor coaxing soup out of things that don\u2019t want to be soup, and every time she says simmer I think of the slow anger I felt on that corner looking at the comma on the windshield unfold. I rest my hand on the couch near June\u2019s hip in a way that is both nothing and everything, and when she stirs and croaks, \u201cDid you get the good gum,\u201d I hold up the pack like a miracle and she smiles in her sleep because faith is sometimes just believing the gum will arrive.\n\nWe are not good at doing nothing, but her body demands it and I am learning obedience by osmosis. The next morning we invent a routine that could qualify as sacred if we both wore better robes. I make coffee in her kitchen that insists on being too small and she eats toast like she remembers it from childhood and not from every day since. The cast makes her right-handedness obedient and bossy, and we discover that a banana is suddenly architecture. We arrange pills in a little plastic prison that says S M T W like a church marquee, and the sound they make hitting the compartments is the sound of a tiny band warming up. When she showers I stand in the hall and tell jokes to the wall because laughter is proof of life, and she calls out for the towel and I deliver it like I was born to hand people towels at the exact moment they remember they are wet. Daylight is gentle until it isn\u2019t, and when the sun shifts into interrogator mode we close the blinds halfway and make our lives happen in that municipal kind of shade.\n\nThree days later, the town decides to test us properly. The weather radio, a small plastic loaf on June\u2019s counter that she claims was a gift from an ex-boyfriend who believed in readiness more than pleasure, screams itself awake uninvited. The sound drills a new hole in my skull and fills it with alphabet soup\u2014storm cell, rotation, debris signature\u2014which is the calm way of saying the sky has remembered it can become a hand. June and I look at each other with that particular Oklahoma smile that means we both want to panic in a charming way. The phone buzzes in sync, a chorus of concern performed by towers and satellites, and somewhere not far from us the sirens begin to pull the day into a longer shape. It is not noon on a Saturday, which means everyone becomes a professional at pretending to be hydrologically literate. We do the thing we were taught in third grade: we make ourselves small, we move to the most interior of interior places, which in June\u2019s apartment is the bathroom that has decided it is a closet\u2019s cousin. I pile the floor with towels and quilts like we are building a fort with none of the romance and all of the intention, and June lowers herself down with that careful choreography of a person who has been assigned a temporary wing.\n\nWe sit on the tile that remembers every foot that has ever been placed upon it, and the cast becomes a white animal between us. June\u2019s breath is too fast at first and then decides to copy mine, and there is no greater intimacy than breathing on purpose in a small room. The tub has a gray ring we both ignore because who we are in a storm is not who we are in a magazine. I hold my phone like a compass and tell her what the weatherman is telling me in a voice trained to be kind to frightened animals: the rotation is north, the rotation is east, the rotation is messing with the people who decided to live near that old industrial park. We remember out loud how we learned to put our backs to glass, how cafeteria ladies herded us like their most fragile breads, how the school janitor opened the door to the boiler room and became for five minutes a priest. June says she could kill for a pretzel and I say if the building remains, I will take this as a commandment and not a preference, and she laughs in the little hiccup way her laugh goes when her body is trying to participate and I want to cry because the sound is a diagnosis I can live with.\n\nThe storm doesn\u2019t visit our block in the way that creates new roofs, but it drags its fingernails across enough neighborhoods that the sirens argue with each other. At one point the power stutters and we become pioneers for a minute, the glow from the phone a new kind of candle that makes us both look like rumors. June reaches for my hand without asking her hand if it\u2019s ready, and our fingers do that embarrassing thing where they know each other faster than the rest of us does. I don\u2019t talk for a minute because I am busy asking the tinier parts of me to behave, and we sit in the tub cave and practice not thinking about everything people in our town have lost to the sky. When the thunder moves away and the rain calms itself like a dog that has decided to accept the leash again, we don\u2019t stand up right away. We stay until the room grows bored with our alive-ness, until June\u2019s phone buzzes with her sister\u2019s report from the other side of town\u2014two fences down, one lawn chair in the neighbor\u2019s pool, the tulips practicing resilience\u2014and we allow ourselves to become upright animals again.\n\nAfter a storm, everything outside looks like it was washed by someone who overdid it. The world shines a little too hard and the air carries that metallic smell that belongs to train tracks and adrenaline. I drive through puddles that want to be lakes and we make good on the pretzel promise at a QuikTrip that hums with second chances. The men in reflective vests are back in session, discussing hailstones like gossip, and someone has put a sign on the roller grill that says CLOSED FOR CLEANING, and the four exclamation points convince me the grill has seen things. We share a pretzel and the cheese cup glows like a campfire stubbornly refusing to go out, and June draws a heart on her cast with a Sharpie because moving ink over new surfaces is its own therapy. She writes the date of the storm in tiny engineer\u2019s numbers and underlines it, an annotation to the week, and I think of how we\u2019re all just margin notes pretending to be text, and I love us for it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t happen all at once, but our time accrues like lint in a pocket that refuses to empty. I start keeping a toothbrush at June\u2019s in a glass that used to hold toothpicks at some party where people dipped tiny sausages into assertive sauces, and after three days it stops surprising us. We organize her medications into small stacks that look like poker we refuse to play and set phone alarms with hilarious names like BONES and HEAD and DO NOT BE A HERO. We learn the exact angle of her couch that allows her arm to be both elevated and ignored. She comes with me to the bar on a Tuesday because she says healing requires field trips. She sits at the back with her elbow perched on a small pillow she brought from home like a wealthy 1840s woman who refuses to touch a chair with bare fabric, and I tell a soft room about the way the weatherman says \u201ctornadic\u201d like a dessert and nobody laughs and everyone nods, and at the end a woman with a face that has done a lot of looking says, \u201cI like the part where you said you put the furniture back,\u201d and I realize I did say that and also that I don\u2019t, not anymore.\n\nAt her pottery class, a group of teenagers with hands like inventions looks at June like she is both cup and kettle. She demonstrates trimming with her right hand and her voice holds all four corners of the room. Clay has never pointed out our clumsiness like this and she decides not to apologize. She tells them about centering by telling them about walking into a storm with a calm you did not pack. She asks me to stand near the splash pan and read the handout because the paper won\u2019t stay open on its own and also because I love the part where the clay remembers its water. I watch a girl discover that her bowl wants to be a spiral and swallow a laugh that would make me unwelcome. June praises a boy\u2019s cylinder like it is a small city learning its zoning laws and I fall in love with stability for the fifth time that afternoon.\n\nIt is not until a week later that we try the Ferris wheel again because people in small towns know not to test a machine that pretended at myth during a storm. The carnival packs up slowly, like it is sneaking out of a house that knows how to hold on. The wheel remains for the last night like a tooth the mouth is not ready to give the tooth fairy. We go on a Sunday when the church parking lots have exhaled and the air has that after-singing exhaustion. June\u2019s cast is now a guest book; there are signatures from her niece, from the pottery kid who made his cylinder stand up straight, from my mother who wrote a verse so tiny I had to use a magnifying app and laughed myself into a better hour when I did. The man with the cash box recognizes us in the way a cash box recognizes faithfuls, and he jokes that the wheel likes apologies. We give him two tickets and promise to treat the thing like a friend\u2019s fragile aunt, and he hands us a napkin like a talisman because sometimes napkins are all you can offer in the face of probability.\n\nThe carriage creaks in the ceremonial way it has learned from generations of creaks, and we sit side by side like conspirators who don\u2019t know the plan yet. The wheel lifts us the way a sentence lifts its clause, and the town becomes a polite map, all its problems looking manageable from the height of pretending. I see the library\u2019s roof, the train car, the church steeple that has figured out its angles, the brick that glows even at dusk because showmanship is a material. June points with her free hand and narrates her favorite corners as if she invented them: the place where the cat colony performs its political theater, the alley where the plant shop hides its overgrown, the rooftop where she once watched fireworks and decided to forgive her father for being the kind of man who fixes things instead of naming them. The wind finds us because it always does, and my stomach does its small mutiny, and June places her palm on the metal bar and says, \u201cThis is how I pray,\u201d and I say, \u201cMe too, with better lighting.\u201d\n\nAt the top, when the wheel pauses to distribute awe, the town gives us back our names and asks what we plan to do with them. I think of the night in the hospital, the beep that kept our time, the nurse with the pearl, the plaid blanket June\u2019s sister brought that made the bed honest. I think of the cross on the highway looking like a recipe I don\u2019t have the oven for. I think of the heavy bowl she promised and how some vessels are engineered to require both hands, that they\u2019re not a failure but a design. I feel the words pushing at my teeth like a crowd at a door, and I do what I always do when my body fills with sentences I can\u2019t figure out where to place: I test one quietly. \u201cYou are my favorite unsafe thing,\u201d I say, and it comes out wrong and right at once, a confession disguised as a koan. June turns her head not all the way, just enough to let me know she knows she has heard something, and she smiles the way a person smiles when she is translating herself for herself. \u201cWe should not raise children,\u201d she says after a beat, and we both laugh the laugh of people who understand the gravity of their joke and also how to survive it.\n\nWe get off the ride with knees we pretend are steadier than they are, and the ground receives us like a parent who forgot to scold. The man with the cash box winks with his mustache and I decide to love him in the precise, limited way one loves cash box men. The lot smells like dust that just remembered it was a person once, and we walk to the edge of the carnival where the trailer with the cotton candy spinner hums like a grandma who knows better. June cannot eat spun sugar with a concussion according to a study I invented, so we share a lemonade that insists on its sourness and insist back with our straws. The sky gives us a dramatic gradient it did not need to give and in return we promise not to complain about the mosquitos, and the mosquitos pretend to accept this and then conduct their business anyway because nature serves its own board.\n\nIn the days that follow, the community shows up in the ways communities do when they are both deeply themselves and accidentally holy. The church ladies bring a casserole with a topography that suggests the presence of Doritos, and my mother insists on staying to do the dishes because the dishes are the only liturgy she trusts. The neighbor on June\u2019s right whose name changes every time she tells it knocks to borrow a cup of flour and leaves with a loaf of bread she baked last week because she thinks the act of giving is a loop. The man who watched the accident calls to ask if June needs someone to mow and refuses money because he says gratitude is currency enough though I know he would not refuse a pie. The kids at the pottery studio present June with a gift: a small ceramic plaque that reads YOU ARE A BOWL WITH HANDS, and the S is backward, and I cry in the bathroom because they have accidentally written scripture.\n\nOnstage, I try the hospital bit again with a small amendment: I mention the way the registrar asked for \u201crelationship\u201d and how the word felt like standing outside a club without the right shoes. I say friend because that is the ticket that lets me in, and I make a joke about how English is a cheap landlord sometimes, and the room laughs in the good way, the way you laugh when you recognize your own lease. I talk about the sirens and how we all become furniture at once, how bravery here is holding very still and letting the storm write its bad poem without us in it. I talk about bowls that make you use both hands and a town that only looks small from the outside, and I realize halfway through that I am trying to talk the shape of my love into language that won\u2019t scare it away. June sits at the back with her elbow on that pillow like a monarch with humble tendencies and her laugh does the thing I pray for, that crack in the middle that lets the room through, and I hold the mic like a barn handle again, like the door to a better self might slide open if I am gentle.\n\nOne afternoon my father appears with a drill he pretends is a passport. He has decided June needs a shelf near her couch because books should come to you when you can\u2019t go to them, and he eyes the wall with the suspicion he saves for anything that claims to be load-bearing without proof. He finds studs like a conjurer and the shelf rises out of the drywall like a lesson. He shows June how to rest the weight of hardcovers with a cast, and she shows him how clay dries faster in this heat if you turn the pieces, and the two of them nod at each other like a handshake between species. My mother brings a jar of soup that is so exactly soup that I want to write it a thank you card, and she leaves notes in June\u2019s cabinets that say LEFT and RIGHT because she thinks it\u2019s funny to prank the future. When my parents leave they stand in the parking lot waving like people who invented waving, and June says, \u201cSometimes I forget to envy you,\u201d and I say, \u201cSometimes I forget to deserve them,\u201d and we let the evening be a neutral witness.\n\nThere is a day when June tries to put her hair in a ponytail one-handed and fails gracelessly and throws the elastic across the room with the zeal of an athlete who wants the joy but hates the sport. I retrieve it and stand behind her and gather her hair in my hands like it is a handful of creek water, and I tell my fingers to remember how to be kind. The elastic goes around twice and the third time is stubborn and I pull it with my teeth and we both stop breathing because that is the kind of intimacy even television refuses to film, and then it is done and her hair is in a silly loop that makes her look like a girl in a photo booth who made a face right before the flash. She turns and the thank you between us is louder than is polite, and I stand very still because motion would be dangerous manipulation. We do not kiss because we are both cowards and archivists; we catalogue the wanting and set it on the shelf my father hung and step away like responsible curators.\n\nBy the time the cast begins to itch, our lives have braided in ways that feel like they were always meant to. We have rules we never wrote down: if one of us says \u201clibrary,\u201d the other one puts on shoes; if one of us says \u201cRon,\u201d the other one must concoct a theory about men who assemble rides in shorts; if one of us says \u201csirens,\u201d the other one says \u201cbathroom,\u201d and we meet there with a quilt and a joke. The bowl June promised begins to take form again under her right hand, assisted by an unpaid assistant with two clumsy ones, and I learn the subtle pressure of supporting without reshaping. She calls the bowl mine out loud and I hear the word like a small bell I could marry. It is heavier this time, on purpose, and when she lifts it to the bat to be carried to the shelf, her elbow asks for help and my hands arrive without a permission slip. The act of carrying becomes a pronoun. The kiln will finish what we cannot, and when it comes out I know I will hold it with both hands, on stage, in kitchens, at QuikTrip tables that pretend to be black tile, and I will talk about how some loves require more of your surface area, how some towns teach you to grip the railing with your words, and how sometimes the ride becomes the point instead of the scenery.\n\nAt night, when sleep tries to flirt and fails, I walk. I walk past the plant shop where the owner has started leaving little notes under the pots like fortunes you can water. I walk past the mural with the roses and the word LOVE and I allow myself to think the L is for Learn and the O for Offer and the V for Velocity and the E for Enough, and I know this is sentimental in a way I would mock on stage and I do not care. I walk to the church where my mother sings, and the choir is rehearsing with the door cracked, and my mother\u2019s alto slides through the night like a spoon through cake. I walk to the place where June\u2019s car learned to reconsider and stand for a minute and let the shadow of a streetlamp run over my shoes, and I do not cry because the asphalt does not deserve the salt. I walk home and make notes on paper that already has notes, and I practice saying the thing out loud to a chair because furniture is safe. I try the sentence \u201cI love you\u201d and it fits and does not fit and the hinge of my jaw considers leaving me and then decides to stay.\n\nOn a Monday morning that looks like it was ironed, I teach June how to tie a scarf one-handed because there is a show she wants to go to in Tulsa and she refuses to be unfinished. She stands in the mirror and I stand behind her doing the kind of math you can only do with fabric, and the knot sits at her throat like gratitude. We get in my car and the BA Expressway is merciful, and the giant cross plays nice and the sky minds its own enormous business. We meet a friend of hers at a gallery that used to be an autoshop and I stand in front of paintings of landscapes that are too honest to be pretty and try to breathe in art like it\u2019s a vitamin. On the drive back we don\u2019t talk for a long time because sometimes silence is the only word that fits and I am trying not to narrate our lives so hard that I miss living them. At a red light, June says, \u201cWe are a bowl with hands,\u201d and I say, \u201cWe are a bowl with hands,\u201d and we grin at the windshield like it is an accomplice, and then the light changes and the world, obedient and wild, moves forward.By the time the cast itches into its own personality, we are in chapter five of the summer in the way you can feel a song move into its bridge without anyone telling you. The bruise over June\u2019s eye ripens into the kind of yellow you only see on ceramic glazes with names like cornfield and vintage lemon, and strangers have stopped giving her the soft sympathy eyes and moved into the stage where they tell her about their cousin who once broke three bones at once but still went to work the next day, like cruelty is a loyalty program you can join. She takes to carrying a wooden spoon to slide under the cotton when the itch becomes a theology, and we negotiate with it like diplomats who know the other side\u2019s demands are just a rattier version of ours. I mark dates on a wall calendar I\u2019ve brought over because my phone can\u2019t handle the gravity of recovery, and the boxes fill with appointments that have either urgency or theater depending on the time of day, and we build our week around the saw that will free her arm like a magician who promises to put the lady back together. The days are the long lake kind, lying out in front of us pretending to be wider than they are, and we learn to put a small boat on them and not overthink whether we packed oars.\n\nThe bowl comes out of the kiln on a Tuesday morning that smells like a joke about coffee and repentance. We are at the studio before the door wants to open because anticipation is an alarm that requires no snooze button, and June\u2019s right hand is a compass needle that keeps returning to the shelf where the owner stacks work like sleeping cats. The bowl is on the second tier-\u2014of course it is\u2014-sitting like it knew we\u2019d make it late if it sat any higher, and it is a color the glaze chart calls river, which feels like flattery to both water and bowl. It is heavy in my palms in the way a choice is heavy and it throws its shadow honestly, and the base has that slight rise like it remembers it was once wheel and air. There is a small crack that decided to be decorative instead of destructive and I say out loud, like a charm, that integrity is a spectrum and not a score, and June grins that dangerous grin that has gotten me through winters. She runs her fingers along the rim with the care of a person petting a skittish animal, and the bowl accepts us with the dignity of something that knows it will be useful even if we decide to worship it by accident. We write my name and the date in small letters on the underside because everything that wants to survive our houses needs archiving, and when I lift it with both hands the bowl nods, like, yes, this is the exact agreement we made.\n\nThe removal room at the orthopedist\u2019s office is bright in the way new money is bright, and there is a poster of a skeleton mid-salsa as if bone health is a party you forgot to RSVP to. The saw is a friendly horror, the tech assures us, and he demonstrates on a piece of foam the way it refuses to bite a balloon, and I cannot imagine a job where your day is convincing people you will not carve them like a ham. June laughs with her mouth and not her eyes because endurance has stages, and when the blade meets the cast it makes a sound like summer cicadas gossiping and the dust that puffs up smells like every chalkboard I ever wanted to apologize to. Underneath her arm is a pale strange cousin of her arm with hair pressed into a wave like an old-timey man\u2019s comb-over, and the skin has a map\u2019s sincerity, and the tech says it looks great and we believe him because he has been hired by reassurance. He tells us about PT like it\u2019s a party favor you earn, and he hands June a squeeze ball the color of a sin she would never commit, and on the drive home she flexes her fingers like she\u2019s practicing a chord and we both clap for different reasons at the red lights.\n\nI book Tulsa on a whim and a dare because a comedian I respect texts me that he has a slot if I\u2019m willing to drive forty minutes and pretend not to mind that the room is an old fire station that forgot to retire. June insists on coming even though I offer her a night of television that requires no posture, and we take the BA Expressway like we are auditioning for a map. The cross at the megachurch exit glows like a GPS for sinners, and I want to be annoyed but I also want to be guided, and I make a note to write a bit about religious signage being the original billboards. Tulsa sidles into us with its art deco and its bridges that look like they studied abroad, and the room turns out to be exactly as weird as promised, with hoses coiled like snakes in the corners and a vintage call box on the wall that pings occasionally like it\u2019s trying to bring ghosts to the show. I do the new hospital run and it lands in me while it lands in them, and the line about \u201crelationship\u201d gets a groan-laugh that is the sound of people seeing their own paperwork. June sits back left with a ginger ale like it\u2019s a contract and nods on the parts where I\u2019m trying to slide a feeling past my own bouncer, and after, the host tells me I found a gear he\u2019s been waiting for me to find. The drive home is one of those nocturnes where the tail lights make a parade we didn\u2019t know we needed, and in the dark June says she keeps thinking about the man who ran into traffic for her and whether he told the story when he got home, and I say maybe he doesn\u2019t tell stories, maybe he just makes shelves, and she makes a small sound like agreement and I want to put my hand on her thigh and mark the moment and don\u2019t.\n\nMy mother invites us to the church potluck with a voice that could sell real estate in heaven, and I say yes because saying yes to the women with crockpots feels like banking favor for the future. We bring the heavy bowl because it demands to be tested by starches, and June carries it in both hands like a mother walking a child to the first day of school. The fellowship hall smells like cumin and resurrection and the table is a timeline of Oklahoma casseroles from Dorito to discipline, and my mother greets June with the exact amount of gentle a person requires when introducing a bruise to a room full of opinions. June tells the choir ladies that the bowl was a collaboration because she\u2019s a generous liar, and they coo over it like it might recite Corinthians if asked. I stand with a plastic fork and listen to Sister Evelyn explain why she refuses to list mayo as an ingredient on index cards because some people don\u2019t need the whole truth, and I wonder if my whole career is just a long argument with that sentence. When the men from the deacon board lift tables in that choreographed way men in their seventies lift tables, June\u2019s eyes go soft and I know she is missing a father she has not fully forgiven, and I turn and ask my own father to tell the story about the time he put a ceiling fan in backwards so it pulled air up instead of down, because nothing fixes the present like putting a fan on it.\n\nJune\u2019s ex-boyfriend appears like weather one afternoon in the form of a text with the subject line \u201cAre you okay,\u201d which is what men write when they want to seem as if they have learned a new language and are still using the old alphabet. She reads it out loud to me in the kitchen while her coffee maker hiccups and I stare at the ceiling crack that looks exactly like a river delta and try to decide whether to be generous or strategic. He is the weather radio guy, the one who believed in go-bags and joked about earthquakes in a state that preferred its disasters visible, and he was not cruel but he was the wrong size for her life, and she replies politely and I cannot tell if the politeness is literal or a mask. After she presses send she taps the counter twice with the fingernail of her right index finger, an old June tic that means she did something brave and will probably need an aspirin for it later. I want to say things like I am here and also I am not him and I am not a plan, but the coffee is making its slow argument for patience and I decide instead to rinse the blueberries in our bowl and place them in front of her like a thesis.\n\nWe host a garage sale not because we need the money but because the objects have begun to whisper and their gossip is exhausting. June sets up a table with cups that failed their interviews and I arrange a neat grid of books I insist I\u2019m ready to let go of and then move three to a private pile like I\u2019m saving soldiers during a draft. The neighborhood arrives in shorts with small bills like hope, and a woman with a toddler buys a chipped mug and tells June she likes the way the chip makes her feel invited to be imperfect, and I watch June\u2019s eyes do the exact thing they do when she thinks about teaching. A teenage boy hovers over a set of measuring spoons for long enough that I finally say, \u201cYou a baker,\u201d and he says \u201cI want to be,\u201d like what he wants is a rebellion, and I throw the spoons in for free because the future deserves good tools. We put out a tip jar that says Hospital Humor Fund because clarity sells, and by noon it is full of wrinkled cash in the way churches like, and we count it together on the workbench while the wheel in the corner pretends not to watch. June writes THANK YOU on a piece of cardboard in her neat right-handed teacher script and tapes it to the garage door, and I have to swallow twice before I can say anything normal because gratitude is a spice that burns if you breathe it too fast.\n\nOnstage, I discover a new timing in a joke about the BA Expressway that makes me feel like I moved a couch to the other wall and the room grew a window. I talk about how merging here is a ritual of consent and how your turn signal is a half-prayer, and a man in a hat shaped like an apology laughs so hard he slaps the table and I forgive him for previously looking bored. I add a bit about hospital eggs versus church potluck deviled eggs and the comparison makes me a little nervous because I have taught myself to keep my mother\u2019s name and mayonnaise out of the same sentence, and she laughs when I tell her later and tells me to add paprika because audiences like color. June sits with both hands around a cup of ice water in a posture that would look like fear if you didn\u2019t know her, and she tilts her head when I hit the line about paperwork that decides if your love counts and I think I will die if she doesn\u2019t get it and I think I will die if she does. After the show a woman with a cardigan counting as a personality corners me at the bathroom sinks and tells me her girlfriend wasn\u2019t listed on a form once and so she didn\u2019t get a call, and I hold her hand while the faucet runs like an organ and promise her I will say the word girlfriend on stage like it is ordinary until it is.\n\nWe take a Thursday field trip to the Blue Whale in Catoosa because the internet told us it is the kind of roadside that makes memory behave, and because neither of us has a hobby that involves bats. The whale sits in the pond like someone\u2019s good idea escaped its tank, and its painted smile is less cheerful up close, the way a clown is always mostly paint. Children climb its spine with the reverence of pirates who paid admission, and a man in a gimme cap reads the plaque out loud like a poem. June stands on the little dock and leans on the rail with her good elbow and I can feel the childhood in her body, the nine-year-old who wanted to be both astronaut and potter and did not understand that both professions have a lot of cleaning involved. We walk through the whale\u2019s stomach and it is both gross and sacred, and I put my palm against the metal rib and feel the morning\u2019s heat stored there like a secret. At the gift stand we buy a sticker that says OKLAHOMA LOVES YOU MORE THAN YOU DESERVE and put it on the back of June\u2019s weather radio because we are tired of letting practicality be humorless. On the ride home we drive slow on purpose, the way you do when the day is a good dog, and we stop at a farm stand for peaches and the woman taking money calls us \u201cyou girls\u201d and for once it feels less like an erasure and more like an inheritance we can edit.\n\nA new student named Ava shows up at June\u2019s pottery class with a face that has been given too many instructions and hands that disobeyed them. She is thirteen in the posture way, head thrust forward like a turtle wearing a crown, and her grandmother waits in a folding chair with a paperback and the concentration of a saint. Ava wedges like she has an argument with the clay that began in another room, and June places her right hand over Ava\u2019s left to change the angle and it is such a simple miracle that I want to call a reporter. The wheel turns and the spiral remembers it is a spiral, and Ava\u2019s breath evens like a machine learning a song, and when the cylinder climbs up like it wants to see out the window the girl\u2019s whole face becomes an event. Later, when the room smells like damp coin adding up to a future, June tells the class to put their names on the bottoms of their pieces and I watch fourteen kids claim the underside, and I feel my chest do that thing again, the widening that always precedes a new bit and a new admission. After class, Ava lingers to ask if she can make something heavy on purpose, and June says, yes, the world requires it and I say, yes, and so do hands.\n\nThe first day we try to run again, it is not actual running, it is the negotiation two women in their thirties have with gravity when one of them has a recently freed radius and the other one has spent the last weeks learning how to be more chair than person. We go to the park where the track loops like a sentence that forgot to end, and we jog in a way that would disappoint any coach, and we applaud ourselves like the crowd you hire for morale. The teenagers in soccer camps slide past as if powered by certainties we no longer own, and the men with early retirements walk in pairs discussing boats they do not intend to purchase, and the geese are geese because nothing we do changes that. June\u2019s breath does the thing it did in the bathroom during the storm, copying mine until it finds its own rhythm, and the sun lowers like it has done this before and will do it again whether or not we participate. On lap two June says, \u201cI think my arm misses being called a wing,\u201d and I say, \u201cI have never not called it that,\u201d and she smiles without looking at me because looking would knock both of us off our line. We finish sweaty and very proud of nothing and sit on the curb to praise our knees and text my mother \u201cWe exercised\u201d and she responds with three clapping hands and a link to an article about hydration that I do not open out of respect.\n\nThe people who play trivia at the bar on Wednesdays have started calling me \u201cthe tornado girl,\u201d which is either a brand or a warning, and I lean into it like a porch in high wind. The host insists on music rounds that are mostly heartbreak disguised as choruses, and June writes our team name as Bowl With Hands even when the bartender mispronounces it on purpose, and every time I nail an answer about a 90s pop star I feel like I\u2019m a citizen again. There is a table of guys who work roofs and guess every sports question with confidence, and once when the storm sirens hiccup outside of schedule, one of them says, \u201cFalse alarm,\u201d without checking his phone, and I am both jealous and tender with the ease of his certainty. We win a $25 tab one week because I recognize a picture of a particular rumpled British author whose books smell like dust and decisions, and we buy onion rings like we\u2019re in a movie, and when the plate arrives June laughs because the onion rings are stacked in a useless tower, and I make a joke about architecture in poor neighborhoods, and the bartender shakes his head at me like he paid for my upbringing and wants a refund.\n\nOne evening, after a late show where the audience behaved like a seated storm, I go home to find a note slid under my door in June\u2019s handwriting that says, \u201cBlueberries are not currently on sale but I bought them anyway,\u201d and below it, a drawing of the bowl with an arrow pointing to its heavy and the words both hands. She has left the blueberries on my counter in a brown paper bag that has lived other lives, and I wash them in the quiet of my kitchen while the crickets pattern their night outside and the highway hums like an appliance you cannot unplug. The bowl sits on my table like a thought I\u2019m ready to think, and I pour the fruit in and they make a sound that reminds me of the way rain sometimes confesses on roofs, and I carry the bowl to the couch with both hands and set it down like a ceremony I didn\u2019t know I was licensed to perform. I eat until my mouth argues with my ambitions, and I write until my wrist complains, and I fall asleep without telling anyone, which is either progress or exhaustion.\n\nThe next morning the laundromat becomes an odd church where people pray by sorting. I go because my building\u2019s machines decided to become fountains, and June comes because she says she misses being bored in public without guilt. The place is a museum of cycles and strangers\u2019 socks, and the woman who runs it has a sign taped to the change machine that says NO SACRED OBJECTS and I spend too long wondering what happened to make that necessary. We fold together in near silence because we are ordinary in this room and it is delicious, and I teach June the fold my mother taught me that makes T-shirts behave and she teaches me the fold someone on the internet taught her that makes fitted sheets give up. A man unfolds a sheet wider than any argument and drapes it over his shoulders like a river, and outside the sky flexes its clouds and then decides to keep the day nice, and everything is so aggressively fine I have to pinch my thigh to keep from crying.\n\nWhen the local library asks me to host an open mic for their banned books fundraiser, I say yes like I\u2019m being asked to hold a baby, and June says she will help if she can be in charge of seating because she wants to put people next to people who need each other. The library at night is a different animal, all spines and secrets, and the teens who come to read are more brave than anyone I\u2019ve ever put on a stage in a bar. A kid in a denim vest reads a poem about a yard sign war on her block and a man in his sixties reads a passage from a novel about joy like he\u2019s admitting an affair, and June rearranges chairs between readers like she\u2019s officiating marriages. We pass the heavy bowl with index cards and pens and ask the room to write down a book they needed at the exact moment they weren\u2019t supposed to read it, and people write titles like contraband and slip them into the bowl like communion, and I decide to sleep with it next to my bed like a relic. After, the librarian with the hair that could defeat a tyrant thanks us both and whispers that the city council is easier when you bring snacks, and June whispers back that we can be weapons and wait staff, and I fall a little more in love with public spaces and a lot more with the person who moves through them like she invented public.\n\nI help June build a website because the kids at the studio are asking for class schedules in a tone that indicates the future expects to be able to click things. We sit at her dining table that is really just an altar to unthreatening groceries, and I try to make words like lip and foot and slip sound like invitations rather than jargon. She frowns at fonts like a general inspecting troops and chooses one that doesn\u2019t look like it will cheat on us, and we take photos of the bowl on every surface in the apartment until we learn that sunlight through that one slat of the blinds is our best cinematographer. We argue about whether to use the word shop or store, and it feels like naming a child, and we settle on shop because it asks for hands. When we publish, the internet responds the way a pond responds to a pebble, with rings that may or may not hit a shore we know, and that night a woman from Nebraska orders two cups like a dare and leaves a note that says, \u201cFor my daughters, for their hands,\u201d and June reads it three times and then once more for the part of her that doesn\u2019t read, and I sit there with my cheek on the table because I don\u2019t know how to hold this inside my head.\n\nAt a family dinner where my father grills chicken like he\u2019s cross-examining it, my mother asks a question without attaching a verb to it and everyone looks at me. The question is June and me and the room is soup and my reply is a posture, and I say that I am collecting all the words for something you can hold with both hands and that none of them are short. My sister, who likes to deliver mercy with a joke, says, \u201cI told you she would make it a paragraph,\u201d and my father brings out the level from somewhere and says, \u201cWhatever you say, let it be straight,\u201d and my mother says, \u201cOr true,\u201d and June reaches for the roasted corn and pretends she is not the weather. Later, on the porch, while the neighborhood kids run a water hose like a government, June leans on the rail and says, \u201cI am not a secret,\u201d and I say, \u201cI don\u2019t have the stomach for secrets,\u201d and we watch my parents pass a dish to each other with an ease you can\u2019t counterfeit, and I feel a small click in my chest, the sound of a hinge deciding which way it wants to swing.\n\nWhen the tulsa comic asks me to open for him on a weekend in August at a club that used to be a theater that used to be a church, I say yes because, honestly, where else am I going to learn to handle ghosts. The room is the kind that eats sound for breakfast, and the greenroom smells like murals and ambition, and I stand backstage with my hand on a curtain that has probably listened to better people and ask it to be gentle. June squeezes my arm where the muscle has been quietly building a case for itself, and I go out into heat and light and my breath does not leave me for once, it stays and behaves, and time and I enter into a contract we both sign. I talk about bowls and both hands and paperwork and sirens and the BA Expressway like it is a personality test we are all failing in the exact same way, and the laughter that comes back is organized and kind, a democracy of noise that puts me in office for fifteen minutes. After, when we drive home and the cross pretends to be only architecture, we don\u2019t turn the radio on and we don\u2019t talk because the night is a glass you should not touch until it has stopped ringing, and I think, very carefully, that I am almost brave enough to say the thing and not ask the room to forgive me.\n\nIt happens in a kitchen because of course it does. June is cutting tomatoes with her careful right hand and I am pretending not to be terrified of the knife like everyone else who has ever loved a person, and the bowl is on the counter holding cilantro with the kind of dignity herbs don\u2019t often get. The window is sweating, the way windows sweat when the outside is training for its own Olympics, and the radio is listing ingredients in a recipe neither of us will attempt. I say her name just to see how it feels in the moment right before I set something down and she says yes without looking up because we have earned that shorthand. I say, \u201cI love you,\u201d in the voice I use for weather reports\u2014measured, precise, respectful of the sky\u2019s autonomy\u2014because I refuse to hand something this serious over to drama, and the words are a bowl I have to lift with both hands. June sets the knife down the way people in movies set down guns, and she looks at me full-on like I\u2019m a painting she paid for, and then she leans her hip into the counter in the subtle way she leaves room for everything she cannot control. She says, \u201cThank you,\u201d first, which should have gutted me and instead stitched something, and then she says, \u201cMe too,\u201d and it isn\u2019t poetry and it doesn\u2019t need to be because we were never going to engrave it on a ring. We stand there with the tomatoes thinking about oxygen and how ridiculous it is that we\u2019ve been doing it right all along, and then she says, \u201cNo single-serve,\u201d and I say, \u201cBoth hands,\u201d and we laugh because we do not know how to stop, and the cilantro is triumphant and the window fogs up because the room finally got interesting.\n\nWe do not turn into other people because that would be disrespectful to the ones who got us here. We still go to QuikTrip and run into the men in reflective vests and haggle over pretzel salt as if we had not recently restructured our entire shared dictionary. We still stop at the plant shop window to admire a snake plant that knows how to survive neglect and we still talk about storms like they\u2019re relatives who might show up with their luggage. We still carry the bowl with both hands and we still make our beds on days when no one is visiting because dignity is a weekday habit. When the sirens test at noon on Saturday, we put our backs to the glass because some rituals deserve repeating even when the weather is on our side, and we let the howl move through us like a choir we didn\u2019t practice for and still somehow know. We are a bowl with hands and a town with a Ferris wheel and a cross that can\u2019t decide and a QuikTrip that keeps the lights on for anyone who can\u2019t sleep, and the line between safe and brave is the place we stand, together, with our elbows on the small tables that would float away if we didn\u2019t.The word girlfriend behaves differently in your mouth depending on the room you hand it to. At the urgent care clinic set up in the pharmacy after the city council forgot to approve a real flu shot budget, the clipboard offers me the tiny blank next to \u201crelationship to patient,\u201d and the nurse, who wears her hair in a ponytail that could double as a weapon, looks at me the way people look at checkers pieces\u2014are you going to move diagonally or not. I circle partner because it sounds like we could open a feed store if comedy goes feral, and when the nurse reads it back she does so as if she\u2019s taste-testing a spice she might introduce to her church chili. June sits on the folding chair with her sleeve rolled up, the bruise at her elbow the exact color of a defiant pear, and when the shot goes in she closes her eyes and breathes like she\u2019s on the wheel, and afterward we stand together at the free cookie table eating small sugar circles like we survived something bigger than a needle. On the way out, a man stopping by for antihistamines tells his wife loudly that the word partner is for people who run construction companies, and June takes my hand with her new right to take it and says, \u201cConstruction it is,\u201d and we walk to the car feeling like we have been issued hard hats we can decorate later.\n\nThe days lean into September the way a person leans into a screen door to hear more neighborhood. Heat holds on like a politician who doesn\u2019t know when to retire, and the brick on Main carries it around like a story it can\u2019t stop telling. The Ferris wheel has moved on in the same stealthy way heartbreak pretends it has, leaving behind a ring of ground that is both pressed and puffed, evidence of temporary joy. The Rose District starts to make early fall noises\u2014cider stands rehearsing, the plant shop bringing pumpkins to the front like new babies, school bands dragging their tubas and their faith down the street on Thursday nights. I am doing a set outside for an event someone calls an artisan night, which means soft jewelry and hard opinions, and my mic is a battery-operated stick that makes my voice sound like it couldn\u2019t wrestle a paper bag, but the crowd is willing to negotiate. June\u2019s table is a small bright republic of cups and bowls and one single platter that looks like a lake you could win at a fair, and when people ask if the heavy bowl is a gimmick she says, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a thesis,\u201d and I watch the way they nod like they\u2019ve always been hungry for a thesis they could set on their table.\n\nWe discover quickly that loving someone with two hands also means asking for their permission with two hands, left and right, comedian and civilian. The first time I tell a joke that belongs too much to June and not enough to the plank we agreed on, she catches it in the back of the room with her eyelids and sets it down gently like it\u2019s a grasshopper that wandered onto the wrong sidewalk. The line is about the day she couldn\u2019t wash her hair with one arm and I had to use my teeth to pull the elastic, and it gets a laugh that feels like people finding a secret door, and after the set we walk silently to the parking lot where the asphalt keeps receipts. She leans against her Camry and the comma in the windshield has settled into a clause, and she says, \u201cThat\u2019s mine,\u201d not like a reprimand but like a reminder of inventory. I say, \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d and I feel the small warm shame that comes when you take a cookie without asking even though the person baking them loves you and would have said yes. We stand there and edit out loud, finding the way to tell a truth without stealing it, and when we\u2019re done, we go to QuikTrip and share a soda like teenagers who both know how to drive but insist on walking each other to the door anyway.\n\nIn my mother\u2019s house the phrase \u201cWe will be in the fellowship hall\u201d means many things that are not a room where you eat, and this time it means we are eating because they are celebrating the choir director\u2019s retirement after forty-two years of telling altos not to chew their words. June arrives with the heavy bowl full of roasted sweet potatoes and rosemary, and the deviled eggs part for it like a sea with paprika, and the sound my mother makes when she sees June carrying it is the soft bell of a woman whose prayer got a tangible answer. Sister Evelyn, who runs the potluck like a benevolent judge, takes June by the elbow and introduces her to anyone who is not already a citizen of our specific universe, and I watch the way June\u2019s face practices warmth in a new dialect, a small-town hospitality that knows how to love people it can find. My father insists on showing her the shelf he hung in the church library for the mystery paperbacks that multiply like rabbits and gives her his level to hold while he points at the wall, which is masculine flirting where I\u2019m from, and she stands there balancing the instrument like she\u2019s prepared to administer sacraments to the drywall. After dish duty, which is the rite by which all my relationships are measured, my mother says quietly, \u201cI like your construction,\u201d and she squeezes my shoulder in a way the Lord never learned to do in painting.\n\nWe decide that if we can carry a bowl together we can carry a couch together, which is a lie two lesbians made famous and I am a fan of tradition. The couch I have is a gray that admits defeat every time you look at it, and we find a used one online from a woman who writes, \u201cIt did not betray us,\u201d which is the kind of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 I am immediately attracted to. It is the color of oatmeal made by an ambitious hotel and the shape of a nap, and it lives temporarily on a second-floor balcony because the woman\u2019s boyfriend has a grudge against stairs. We recruit three neighbors with the promise of pizza and the guarantee that I will find a bit about this that makes them look better than they are, and together we perform the ballet of furniture removal that involves more yelling about angles than anyone wanted. The couch scolds the stairwell with its corners and my hands discover muscles I only use when I have to argue with geometry, and when we finally get it into my living room it looks smaller, the way victory does when it sits down. We put the heavy bowl on the coffee table like a cornerstone and order too much pizza because hunger is a bully, and we eat on paper plates that have been raised to believe they are enough.\n\nBecause we are in Oklahoma and the sky has a flair for drama, there is a fall morning where the air is sly and polite and the news says frost like it\u2019s a guest we should prepare for. June wants to see the tall grass before it gives up, so we drive to the Wichita Mountains in a car that has learned to trust us. The land there looks like the earth has knuckles and the wind has opinions, and every boulder is an elder with secrets about buffalo and park rangers and teenagers who chose their locations badly. We hike in the manner of two people who have watched other people hike and believe it involves the same muscles as continuous storytelling, and the path is stubborn but fair. At a lookout that looks out over a small lake pretending to be a god, we spread a towel and eat peanut butter sandwiches like people whose vows include crunchy, and I can see the way June\u2019s shoulders unclench in front of that horizon. She tells me a story about her father teaching her to throw a softball that sounds like teaching and grief braided tight, and I tell her a story about my mother\u2019s whistle, the one that could call me across three blocks and four sins, and we discover our childhoods might have been neighbors if not geographically then in the way they made us pack snacks. On the way home, we pull over at a stand that claims to have the best peach ice cream on this side of the county line, and because I have lived long enough to know that disputes about county lines are mortal, we buy two cones and eat them too fast and look like we\u2019ve kissed a sugar ghost.\n\nOctober brings a small invitation and a larger radius. A club in Oklahoma City that used to be a Methodist church and then was a bar and now is a bar that remembers it used to be a church asks me to do fifteen minutes in front of a headliner who has an album that once helped me survive a February. The room is beautiful in the way they don\u2019t let rooms be anymore, high windows and echoes that have hugged hymns, and I stand backstage doing the math on my breath. June wants to come but her kiln has decided to be French and temperamental and she cannot ask the other potters to babysit their own work because art is a group lie that requires time management, so she kisses my cheek like it owes her money and sends me with a lucky quarter she claims she found under the mat at work. Onstage that night time behaves well and my feet remember the places on the floor where the light forgives your face, and the bit about paperwork asking who gets to be called next carries the room like a song we all knew the chorus of before anyone taught us. After, in the greenroom that still smells like lemon pledge and performative masculinity, the headliner tells me I did not rush past the quiet and I keep the sentence in my pocket like bail money. When I get back to the car there is a text from June that only says, \u201cListen,\u201d and an audio clip of her kiln firing, the low roar of it like a patient machine, and I sit in the driver\u2019s seat and play it twice and then a third time for the part of me that still doesn\u2019t think I deserve sounds that exact.\n\nOur first fight chooses a Tuesday because Tuesdays believe in themselves. It begins with a plant dying, which is the most lesbian way to begin anything outside a U-Haul contract. The snake plant in June\u2019s window decides that despite its reputation for surviving neglect and conversation about neglect, it will make a point by slumping theatrically. June blames herself with a precision that would impress a jury, and I come in too quickly with jokes about resiliency that sound brave in a bar and condescending in a kitchen. She looks at me like the table suddenly grew an edge, and she says that not every wound wants a laugh, and I say defensively that laughing is how I get the air in, and she says that sometimes I suck the air out, and we stare at each other across the poor plant like two countries who forgot where they drew the border. We do the polite thing, which is to go quiet and cut vegetables and wash knives, and our quiet has elbows. The apology happens at the laundromat because the laundromat refuses to let anyone keep a grudge when the dryers are involved, and I say I am sorry in the language of switching clothes without losing socks and she says she is tired as if tiredness were a sin, and we load a machine and make an altar out of quarters, and when our towels emerge from the heat they are warm enough to change the conversation. The snake plant gets repotted with a mix of soil the internet told us to trust, and it stands mildly improved in its new home, and we decide we will not name it because we are not gods, despite evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe library hosts a zine-making workshop in a conference room that during the day contains six quiet men pretending to study the classifieds, and we go because the flyer taped to the circulation desk has a picture of scissors that looks like joy. A group of teenagers whose hair communicates in languages we never learned arrive with backpacks full of tape and conviction, and a retired art teacher named Mrs. Petty leads us with the energy of someone who still insists you wash brushes properly. We fold paper into eighths and write small manifestos about our particular corners of the city, and June writes instructions on how to center clay that would help a person get through a divorce, and I write about the exact friction at the base of the throat when you decide to tell a true thing. At the end we trade our little booklets like baseball cards and watch each other\u2019s faces read us, and the librarian, whose cardigan has an apology stitched onto the elbow, puts out a box labeled COMMUNITY COPIES and says we can make as many as our hearts and the Xerox will let us. On our walk home, our fingers are smudged with ink and a girl on a scooter passes us like a small comet, and June says, \u201cI forgot how much cutting-and-pasting is a spiritual practice,\u201d and I say the internet is a zine with too many pages, and we both hum in agreement like a choir of two.\n\nThe kitchen has become our sanctuary and our lab, and the bowl is both our catechism and our experiment. We make a stew that begins with onions because everything true begins with onions, and we put the seasonings in like we\u2019re adding adjectives to a sentence that cannot handle adverbs tonight. The heavy bowl holds the bread dough while it\u2019s deciding whether to grow and the dough decides to be generous in a way that makes me feel personally forgiven. We eat at the table that once was a place we put mail and pamphlets from dental offices, and we set our phones in a separate room because the phones are toddlers who cannot be trusted near open flames. June tells me about a cup a student made that cracked in the kiln but did so in a way that made the damage into a line that looked designed, and I tell her about a man at the bar who apologized to me for laughing because he thinks his wife would not have liked my joke and she has been dead ten years, and we talk about how grief is a room you keep returning to even when you\u2019ve moved. After dishes we sit on the floor and lean our heads against the couch like people in an Ikea catalogue pretending to understand minimalism, and our feet touch in a way that is both ridiculous and absolutely correct.\n\nWe invent a holiday because the calendar offered a day blank enough to be arrogant. We call it Both Hands Day and all it means is we do everything slower and require two of something before we do it. Two walks, one in the brightness and one in the bruised light. Two jokes where only one would do. Two songs the radio insists on calling classics, with two choruses each sung by two voices that are both ours. We invite my parents and June\u2019s sister without telling them the title because they already suspect us of making new religions, and we set out two types of pie and two jugs of tea and two small bowls of salt because my mother cannot abide underseasoning even philosophically. In the late afternoon we take two cars down to the little park with the metal slide that conducts the sun like an orchestra, and we sit on two blankets while the kids make up a game with two rules, and my father and June\u2019s sister argue amicably about which direction the wind is from using two different apps. When the light goes soft we hold the bowl in our laps at the same time because no one wrote the commandment that says you cannot, and we pass it back and forth between knees and palms like it\u2019s teaching us something we don\u2019t have words for yet, and we light two candles when we get home because we like the way the room looks in pairs.\n\nI realize I have stopped apologizing for mentioning QuikTrip as if it were an embarrassing accent. We go on Thursdays at 9 like people who have a standing commitment to a church that sells pretzels and cold brew, and we watch the night students buy energy in cans and the men in reflective vests change shifts at the coffee urns with the grace of a relay team. The cashier with the eyeliner that could challenge a winged creature compliments June\u2019s cast graffiti as if it were a permanent tattoo, and June tells her she\u2019ll miss the attention when it\u2019s gone, and the cashier says you\u2019ll still have the jawline, and the banter is its own merit badge. The first time we go back after the confession in the kitchen, our mouths both do small unflattering things when we spot the table near the wall that pretends to be black tile, and when we sit down and the chair makes its unglamorous complaint, we realize that we have built a temple in a gas station and somehow the gods do not mind. We share a hot dog not because it is wise but because we are not always, and we laugh with our heads bowed and our shoulders up and the room winks with its fluorescent kindness.\n\nThe city introduces a new mural and demands our attention, which is how cities flirt. This one takes up the side of a building that used to sell wedding dresses and now sells artisanal pickles, and it is a map of Broken Arrow that refuses to be a map, all florals and coordinates hiding in the leaves. The artist is a woman with a buzz cut and a blog and she sits on the sidewalk eating a sandwich while a teenager holds a bucket and three mothers scold their children for touching even though the paint is on a wall thirty feet above their heads. We watch for a long time because watching people make things is the only reality television my soul can tolerate, and we talk about what we would draw if someone gave us a building and no reprimands. June says a row of bowls seen from above, which would look like planets that would rather be handled, and I say a long microphone cord winding through all the streets like a river of listening, and the artist comes down on her ladder to ask if we\u2019re planning to stay all day and we say yes like weird kids in a classroom we actually liked. In the end the mural includes a small hidden Q and a small hidden T, and I text my mother a picture with the caption that she is to blame for the way we turn everything into a treasure hunt, and she sends back a heart and a recipe and a correction for a comma I forgot.\n\nWe take a road trip that isn\u2019t to anywhere your friends would brag about on the internet because we are experimenting with a theory that satisfaction has more to do with roadside produce than vistas. We drive to a town weathered enough to be honest that has a diner called Dot\u2019s Caf\u00e9 where the floor tile is missing a square that the waitress refuses to get fixed because finding it is part of the experience. Dot\u2019s has a menu that doesn\u2019t use italics and the pancakes arrive with butter that has decided to be a sculpture, and June and I arbitrage syrup like economists trying to save a nation. On the way back we stop at a thrift store that smells like generosity and mothballs and June finds a jacket that looks like a solution, and I find a set of measuring cups that nest together like sisters who decided to be gentle this year. We pull over to watch a yard sale where a woman is selling four ceramic garden gnomes with faces like uncles and a box of VHS tapes labeled in a neat hand, \u201cDays I Want to Remember,\u201d and we buy neither because sometimes you get to leave the past in other people\u2019s driveways.\n\nThe day the paperwork catches up to us doesn\u2019t arrive with sirens or brass bands, just a letter in a window envelope that announces in its confident law firm font that we can now add each other to our emergency contacts online. We sit at the dining table like it is a court and we are both witnesses and defendants, and we type our names into a form that has the gall to ask whether we are married, and we check the box that says \u201cdomestic partner,\u201d which is a phrase that sounds like two goats in a small wagon. We ask each other questions like middle-schoolers\u2014favorite hospital, blood type, who to call if you can\u2019t call me\u2014and we answer them with a seriousness that would make our younger selves laugh and also admire us. When we hit submit, the website spins its bland little circle and then pronounces us up-to-date, and June toasts our laptops with her water glass and I cry a little bit because I am sentimental and also because the internet just made us real in a way it didn\u2019t ask permission for. We celebrate by reorganizing the spice drawer because love is glamorous exactly when you do not expect it to be, and we argue about whether cumin belongs next to coriander or paprika, and the answer is both, which is the kind of fight we trained for.\n\nMy mother invites us to a women\u2019s retreat that involves paper crafts and feelings, and she promises me that if I come, she will not make me sing \u201cOceans\u201d with my eyes closed. The church has rented a lodge that was once a 4-H camp, and the beds are obedient and the coffee smells like hospitality reclaimed from the edge. The women I grew up watching present masculine casseroles are here in leggings and determination, and they embrace June with a warmth that would make you kinder even if you arrived rude. We sit in a circle and write letters to our former selves and then read them into a paper bag to be recycled, and I write to the girl who thought her jokes were a confession booth and tell her that sometimes you are allowed to be both priest and penitent, and June writes to the girl who thought perfection was the only way to earn peace and tells her to throw a pot that looks like a hill and call it faith. After, in the small quiet of the woods that still smell like organized trees and kid breath, my mother walks with us and tells us her own story of a friend she loved and did not know how to call friend in the right way then, and the regret sits between us like a polite dog, and we pet it and send it home. On the drive back, June says retreats are weird because everyone cries in a room where folding chairs are present and I say stand-up is the same but with beer, and we laugh like we have invented the hybrid we plan to pitch.\n\nBy the time the last warm evening gets its minute, we have built a calendar that looks less like a plan and more like a quilt. Tuesdays are comedy and teenagers molding their thumbs into cylinders, Wednesdays are trivia and onion rings stacked like a metaphor for municipal budgets, Fridays are dates that involve used bookstores and the ritual of silently dividing the dollar section, Saturdays are errands that have learned to become flirting. We fit dentist appointments and oil changes and a kiln we must babysit with chairs and crossword puzzles, and we organize our time in a way that would persuade an accountant our souls are solvent. We still fight sometimes, like the morning I forgot to refill the ice tray and June accused me of not caring about the future, which is not something you should say to a comedian who built a career out of refusing to predict outcomes, and we still make up in places that don\u2019t deserve it, like the aisle with the laundry baskets in the big-box store that knows our car by sound. On the night the first cold front sighs into town and the BA Expressway shivers in its concrete, we stand on the balcony of my third-floor apartment and look out at the neon signs practicing endurance, and I hold the heavy bowl in my hands empty and watch the wind climb inside it like something it needs, and June leans her head on my shoulder and says, \u201cWe are weatherproof,\u201d and I say, \u201cWe are willing,\u201d and the crickets decide to agree because it makes their job simpler.The ice announced itself the night before like a guest who texts at 3 p.m. and says, I\u2019m bringing three friends and one of them is loud. The weather radio lifted its little plastic throat and gave us vocabulary we didn\u2019t want\u2014freezing rain, accumulation, downed lines\u2014and the men in reflective vests at QuikTrip were already stocking up on cinnamon rolls that could double as a currency. June set the heavy bowl on the counter like we were about to hold the sky and I pulled blankets from closets like my mother taught me that warmth is mostly preparation. The cats I do not own walked under parked cars like weather knows their names, and our neighborhood group chat turned into a recipe exchange for keeping pipes from having existential crises. We filled the bathtub with water because somewhere a grandmother still lives in both of us, and June taped the weather radio\u2019s cord to the wall so it wouldn\u2019t sulk off the counter when the power went out. The city\u2019s trees had not yet become tuned instruments but the leaves made a sound like someone trying to remember a hymn, and I felt that small thrill you are not allowed to admit\u2014disaster at a polite distance makes the blood behave\u2014right before the adult part of me did a headcount of the things we might need to keep breathing.\n\nBy morning Broken Arrow wore glass. Limbs wore sleeves that changed the way light understood them and the grass blades all held their tiny swords the way a chorus might hold candles. The air picked a temperature and committed in a way most of us never do, and the first crack we heard was not thunder or gunfire but the sound of a tree forgetting how to stand. We had done the sensible things\u2014charged, stocked, discussed, teased the idea of not being overconfident\u2014so when the lights clicked once like they were practicing and then decided to consider other opportunities, we simply became people who know how stoves behave without electricity. June lit the burners with a match like she was proposing to them, and we balanced the heavy bowl over a simmer so the dough would pretend the world was still steady. Across the hall, Mr. Lopez swore in Spanish to a god who has learned to accept feedback, and downstairs the college kid with the aquarium knocked to ask if anyone had a generator and if the generator could love fish specifically. The hallway turned into a marketplace for extension cords, opinions and the kind of neighborly banter you only bring out when the lights are down, and I found myself standing there in boots and a sweater the color of a plan, giving the laugh I give when people need to know that I am competent and will not ask for a clipboard.\n\nThe trees turned chimes by noon. Every gust got translated into a noise someone could have patented if nature believed in paperwork, and the streetlights, sleeping and upright, looked like saints on strike. We packed a go-bag because June\u2019s ex taught her to believe in readiness so hard she has a weather app that sends her poems, and I slid our important papers into a folder labeled FIRE in case irony wanted to play, and I put the bowl\u2019s receipt in there too as a joke that I had to explain to myself. The church down the street announced it would become a warming center using a font that didn\u2019t deserve that responsibility, and my mother texted a photo of the choir in coats around a piano because faith is a skill set in a power outage. We walked carefully past yards that had invented new sculptures, holding hands not because the sidewalk demanded it but because the world had shifted a quarter inch and I needed to be sure her weight was still real. The giant cross on the highway threw no shadow and looked suddenly human, a skeleton left standing when the flesh took a day off, and I wanted to tell it I understood.\n\nEveryone knows the first thing you do after you open a warming center is find the cord that will behave like an extension of your lungs. The fellowship hall filled with the smell of instant coffee and old carpet and relief, which is the same smell in every church basement from here to wherever Jesus found bowls that big. I grabbed the mic from the youth group\u2019s karaoke setup and spoke like I was calling us to order, which I was in a small way, and I found that my voice knew how to make instructions sound like an invitation. \u201cBlankets along the back wall,\u201d I said, inserting the word please because manners are a theology here, \u201chot drinks to the left, medical check-in near the coat racks, small people can color on the stage but no one ascends the drum kit like Moses.\u201d People laughed with their shoulders because their mouths were busy being alive, and June started a little assembly line of cups and ladles and whispered to every person who came through like she had their biography in her pocket. My father arrived with a toolbox like a devout man brings scripture, and he fixed a radiator with stubbornness and a borrowed coin, and I watched him work the way you watch someone do a trick that has saved you before. Sister Evelyn materialized with soup you could stand a spoon in, and I declared our bowl a community asset for the afternoon, and people dipped from it with a reverence usually reserved for sacraments and margarine at holiday dinners. The sound of branches failing made us all flinch in unison twice, and by the third time we had learned to read the pauses, and I felt the room become a single creature despite its upholstery.\n\nBy evening, the city had the look of a place that had already told all its stories once today and was willing to repeat them if we asked politely. We walked back through a neighborhood rearranged by force and gravity, and it felt like the day after a wedding where the chairs are still out and the flower petals are honest about their wilt. June carried the bowl empty the way someone carries a newborn after the first bath, with both hands and a confidence that frightened me a little with its beauty. We passed a young couple trying to free a branch from a power line with the kind of plan that would have insulted a cartoon, and I made a joke and then made a better suggestion, and they asked if we had a chainsaw like asking for a spare moon. Back at the apartment the temperature had decided to be brave, and we perched candles in jars of dried beans like Pinterest refugees because necessity is very good at convincing you it invented taste. June propped her weather radio like a small angry friend near the window and I wrapped my hands around a mug that I did not need to drink from to feel hot and called my mother to hear how many gallons of chili my father thought could solve the grid. We slept under three blankets pretending to be one, and the ice popped and the trees argued and the cat I still do not own found the stairwell and sang, and June\u2019s breath beside me recited the poem my life has been trying to write without lying.\n\nThe second day of the outage taught me a new way to count. We measured time by when the neighbor\u2019s generator coughed and when the ice finally fell from the mailbox like it had taken a core sample of our past. The heavy bowl earned its name by holding heat from the oven we woke twice to give it concept, and we ate bread that failed upward and called it rustic because naming is a kindness. The hallway evolved into barter again and I handed out the last of our tea lights like I was officiating small marriages that would last four hours if you were lucky and shorter if you breathed too hard. On our way to check on Mr. Lopez with a thermos we baptized in the sink, we found the college kid with the aquarium in tears because he had been certain about something and the fish disagreed, and June knelt in that gentle way she has and said a prayer to the god of small lives that I believed in without needing to meet. When the power came back for an hour at noon and then left again like a boyfriend with an opinion, the entire building made a noise like we were trapped under one laugh that had to turn into a curse midway through, and I found myself telling jokes in the hallway not because it was my job but because my mouth is a machine that wants to make wheels. People sat on their thresholds in coats and we became a block party of exhaustion and good-natured complaint, and when the upstairs kid asked me if I would do my set right there I did three minutes clean and learned that jokes about ice travel well if the audience\u2019s toes agree.\n\nIn the end it was the church who saved our freezer meat and the QuikTrip who saved our morale. When the power made its final return in the late afternoon, the sound filled the rooms like a dog tail and we all clapped, including my father on speakerphone because he claps at anything with the audacity to turn on. June and I looked at each other across the kitchen\u2019s restored hum like people who have been told their marriage is legal in a state that previously wanted to argue, and then we looked at the clock because the warming center needed cleaning and soup bowls needed the kind of washing that constitutes a citizenry. We walked back through a neighborhood made damp and shining and a street littered with dreams that used to belong to trees, and Sister Evelyn handed me a dishrag and informed me with love that my rinsing needed to be more persuasive. The room echoed again with the long low sounds human beings make when they remember they are temporary, and I found myself humming with the dishwasher like we had a common ancestor.\n\nThe first show after the ice landed me in a packed room that had all discovered Tuesday again. The city carried a hangover and a gratitude, and you could feel it in the way we all agreed to take off our coats and believe in non-seasonal drink orders. I ran the new bit about the warming center and the mic I used like a shepherd\u2019s crook, about the weather radio\u2019s insistence that we think in triangles, about the hallway set where Mr. Lopez heckled me with theology and I accepted because we were all clergy that day. I did the line about the giant cross without its lighting and the way we decide to love symbols with batteries, and the laugh arrived from the good part of the room, the part that hadn\u2019t decided yet what it wanted to be better about. June sat back left with her elbow on a pillow she\u2019d smuggled in under her coat and smiled with that head tilt that means she\u2019s watching the timing find itself, and when I hit the last line about both hands and the soup bowl, she let go of her breath in the way that tells me my work made a landing that I can build on. A man came up after and told me about the way his grandmother used to keep her pilot light alive with a hair dryer and faith, and I wrote the sentence down because sometimes audiences do your job for you at a level you cannot invoice.\n\nIn the quiet after the storm, the city started to ask its questions again. There were branches to haul and fences to prop and intersections to treat like conversations and the library resumed telling us what books we were late for. June\u2019s studio became a relief center for objects, with shelves of cups that now looked like survivors and bowls that demanded a second firing as if they had not been told they were enough. I sat in the corner and did my email like a person who has learned to read a claim number as if it were a poem, and June taught a class where she described how the wheel forgives you if you forgive it first, and the teenagers wedged with the seriousness of people who have been warned wisely about their wrists. Late in the afternoon a girl named Kayla cried because the lip of her bowl won, and June put her right hand over Kayla\u2019s left and told her that clay loves two chances, and the rest of the class exhaled in a room that held both anonymity and witnesses. I stood there with my notebook pretending to work and really just collected the words we are building a house with. It is a strange kind of intimacy to recognize the sentence you will tell a room later while it is being born in front of a sink with someone else\u2019s sponge.\n\nSeptember turned to a kind of October that remembered how to be generous. The school band marched past the mural practicing for a homecoming queen who would wave like a person who knows this will be written in her bones later, and the plant shop lined up a small parade of pumpkins that had been told their names already. The city announced a harvest festival with a poster that contained too many fonts and we said we would go because we are obligated to witness our town try. June got invited to set up a table with the potters and I said yes before she could consider humility, and we spent a Friday night labeling things with small numbers that looked like they remembered being lottery tickets. The heavy bowl got its own sign that said HANDLE WITH BOTH HANDS in a font my mother would approve of and Sister Evelyn would edit, and the first person who tried to lift it with one palm realized her arm was an optimist and laughed the laugh that signals future loyalty to a craftsperson. I went on at six with the sun trying out its evening colors and a mic balanced on a stand that had seen better weddings, and I talked about bowls and hands and paperwork and sirens in front of a row of hay bales that believed in splinters, and a child yelled punch line at the wrong time and I told her there\u2019s no wrong time for making friends with a noise. We closed our booth in the dark and counted our money the way pioneers must have counted their spoons after a rough winter, and June bought a jar of pickles from a man who insisted they would heal our relationship, and I said we have a jar for that already and it\u2019s called talk.\n\nA week after the ice, the city council decided to be the city council in public about art. There was an agenda item about performance permits and amplification, language that promises not to be about you until someone reads it in a tone that makes your name show up in the margins. The library sent a mass email with the subject line COMMUNITY CONVERSATION and the body of the message read like a dare from a friendly aunt, and June and I went because love is not just soup and bowls, it is also chairs and microphones and the ability to sit still in a room where some people have decided to argue with their own breath. I wore a sweater that said please but sturdier on the inside and June wore her jacket that tells the truth, and we took our seats and nodded at the people who clean our teeth and fix our shoes and teach our kids to read their own handwriting. A man stood up and asked why comedy needed to be loud, and I stood up and said my job is not to be louder than your life but to sneak inside it with permission, and a woman in a hat with a scripture embroidered around the brim asked if any of this had to do with the children, and I said all of this has to do with the children because they will inherit the room we build, and her face softened the way wheat does before it gets cut. June put her hand on my knee under the table when it was not my turn, and the head of the council rubbed his eyes in a way that said he needs more vegetables, and in the end they voted to let us keep our small noises as long as we promise not to grow up to be a stadium. We filed out with that specific exhaustion that follows civic successes that could have been failures, and on the steps we ran into the muralist eating a granola bar like a cigarette, and she nodded at us like we had pulled a nail out of her tire without asking to be mentioned in the blog.\n\nWhen my grandmother\u2019s roommate from the retirement home died, the funeral was an exercise in respect and practical hats. We drove to a chapel that has sold more tissues than space and sat with two dozen people who had known this woman\u2019s handwriting better than her handwriting knew itself. The pastor had been assigned the eulogy in the same way people are assigned casserole duty, and he told a story about a potluck in 1987 that involved an exploding microwave and the devil\u2019s urge for Tupperware, and we all laughed in the cleaned-up way you laugh when grief is in the room wearing socks. June squeezed my hand at the part where the pastor said the deceased was someone who preferred to return the grocery cart to the right place even when no one was looking, and I remembered the day I first pushed a cart into its corral and thought of my future self obligingly, and I cried because someone we did not know had made our sidewalks safer for those of us who would arrive later. After, in the fellowship hall, I found the guest book, a fetish item in Oklahoma, and I wrote our names and a sentence about bowls because that is what\u2019s left of me most days, and the family thanked us with the face people wear when they wonder if the strangers in their grief belong here and then decide anyone with hands does.\n\nThe first assignment we gave ourselves after the storm was to say the word girlfriend in rooms that didn\u2019t know whether to clap. We tried it at the pharmacy with the ponytail nurse and at the DMV where the line is a religion, and we tried it at the hardware store where my father buys screws like he is rescuing orphans, and we tried it at the church where my mother prays most of her prayers with a dust rag. Each time the word behaved differently, softened or sharpened by carpet or tile, fluorescent light or sunlight, eyebrows or none. At the plant shop, the owner got a look on her face like the pothos behind her had told her a secret, and she said, congratulations, and what do you think of that variegated monstera, and we answered with the confidence of people who had recently survived a meteorological reminder that none of this is guaranteed. At QuikTrip, the cashier with the eyeliner said, honey, of course, and gave us two extra packs of ketchup unasked, and June whispered to me that this is how institutions redeem themselves, and I nodded like a parishioner.\n\nThe radio offered me a slot on a public show about local culture because someone had decided I was local and culture, and I said yes because my mother learned who I was from church bulletins first and NPR second. The host had a voice like someone you want to invite to narrate your home movies, and he asked about the ice storm and bowls and a cross that can\u2019t make up its mind, and halfway through he asked, very gently, what it is like to love someone in a place that doesn\u2019t always know how to file the paperwork for what you feel. I smiled at the engineer window that keeps you humble and said that love is a form and a performance and a kitchen and a community and a QuikTrip, and that we don\u2019t need the room to clap as long as the room lets us find each other without pretending not to be cold. He said thank you in the way people say thank you when the word is doing push-ups, and after we were off-air he showed me his wallet where he keeps a folded photo of a man and a toddler in a pool, and I told him the water makes their shoulders happy, and he said, I know, and we stood there for a second inside a quiet that didn\u2019t want to end.\n\nWe got invited to dinner by June\u2019s father because men who fix things eventually figure out that stew is another form of repair. He lived in a house on the outside edge of town where the lawns are tired by October and the fences have evidence of teenagers leaning. He had hands that underlined and a laugh stored in that chest voice men think they invented, and he greeted June with an inspection that doubled as love. I stood in the door with my polite coat and the gift of coffee my mother insisted you bring a person who thinks filters are fancy, and he nodded at me like I had told him something printable. He asked what I do and I said I tell the truth out loud until someone cares, and he said, sounds expensive, and I said it pays in soup, which pleased him because all fathers I have ever met appreciate a barter. During dinner he asked exactly two questions that were direct and one that went in sideways and all of them said, I would like to learn how to trust what you tell my daughter you will do. June answered him with the patience of a student who has been preparing for this oral exam since childhood, and afterward we sat on the couch and watched a football game no one really believed in, and he asked me what I thought about the cross on the highway, and I told him the joke, and he laughed in that particular male way that means you have been inducted into a club that does not have a charter, and when we left he handed June a small toolbox she had left there at twenty-two, and I realized that forgiveness sometimes looks like returning a borrowed thing that never should have been kept.\n\nThe first really cold show of the season was a bonfire in a backyard with a stage made from the promise of plywood. The host had strung Edison bulbs across oaks that had recovered from the ice like veterans, and the audience sat on lawn chairs and warm beverages and a day\u2019s worth of decisions. I wore boots with soles thick enough to negotiate and a sweater my sister calls an apology, and the mic behaved like a good dog who knows where to sit. I told new jokes about soup as liturgy and paperwork as a love language, and I tried the one about saying girlfriend in rooms that can\u2019t decide if they\u2019re gyms or rec centers, and the laughter climbed over the fence and went to the next yard without asking permission because the night needed to be shared. June stood near the fire with her hands out in that old prayer and her junior-high student Ava huddled beside her throwing her chips back into the bag like she was feeding a fish. After the show a man with a tattoo of a storm cell on his forearm told me he named it after his daughter because he wanted her to remember to be big, and I nodded like the night wasn\u2019t now wanting to make me simpler.\n\nAt some point the two of us took a Sunday nap like a sacrament. The sky wore flannel and the BA Expressway hummed with its November hymn and we lay on the couch we had acquired together and fell asleep in a way I will never be able to perform onstage with integrity. When we woke, the light in the living room had moved to the spot that makes dust look like a decision, and June\u2019s hair left a pattern on my forearm that I wished I could keep in clay. We ate leftover stew from her father\u2019s house and bread we pretended to have baked on purpose, and the heavy bowl sat between us like a third presence that had begun to offer opinions. I told June that one day I want to do a show in a room that serves soup from a pot instead of from a bar, and she said one day she wants to teach a class where no one apologizes for gravity, and we wrote these things on paper that already had grocery lists on it, and the lists looked like a map of a life we had always meant to arrive at.\n\nIt was the kind of winter day where the sky wore its best stern face when the library hosted a panel on banned books that included me by accident because someone saw my bit online and decided metaphor qualified as expertise. The room was warm with coats that had given up and pockets that had held cords and cookies and petitions, and the table at the front had four people who had all been told no at some point and had looked at the word like it was plastic. A teacher talked about reading a novel to a class whispering because her principal didn\u2019t understand that whispering is holy and the librarian described the box where people can leave angry notes and the notes that weren\u2019t angry but used the same font, and I said that laughter is a way we prove to ourselves we can still move air through our bodies when what is happening asks us not to. Someone in the back asked if comedy is dangerous, and I said yes and it is also the blanket the dog will not surrender because it smells like everyone, and the audience made that sound again, the one that says we have decided, for the next hour, to tell the truth with supervision. After, we put out the heavy bowl with pens and asked for titles of books that taught people how to live inside a house with weather, and the words came in small careful handwriting like we were willing spells into being, and I wanted to drive to the city councilmembers\u2019 houses and pour the bowl onto their doorsteps like a blessing they did not ask for and cannot return.\n\nThe heater in my apartment developed an opinion about working when asked, and I called the landlord and he sent a man named RON who wore shorts because the universe enjoys the callback more than any of us do. He stood in my living room with those knobby knees that have seen too many summers and said he would persuade the unit to recall its purpose, and I made small talk about ice storms and resilience and bowl-based relationships because silence in my home while a man touches the walls makes me feel like the house will develop bad habits. He asked if the heavy bowl was an heirloom, and I told him yes, from a future we\u2019ve already met, and he laughed in that way contractors laugh when they are fond of your pipes. He left with the heater grudgingly employed and a warning about filters, and June and I changed the thermostat to a modest number that would have made my grandmother proud, and we sat on the floor in our socks eating oranges because we are determined to be a cliche that earns its keep, and the peels made the room smell like a sunny day we did not deserve, and we decided to keep deserving it for as long as we could manipulate the angles.\n\nOn a Wednesday that pretended to be Monday I forgot my set list and learned a new kind of faith. I stood in front of a room with a face and a mic with a history and I opened my mouth and asked the day to tell me what it wanted to hear, and it offered me the story of the warming center and the paperwork and the way we use both hands and the teenagers who bring their broken cylinders to a teacher with a laugh that proves there is no wrong shape. I talked about the way June touches clay like it was always a person and about the church potluck where Sister Evelyn policed mayonnaise and about how we are all keeping pilot lights alive with hair dryers and stubbornness, and the audience gave me the kind of attention that feels like a loan and a gift at once. After, I wrote the set down from memory and found the gaps where fear had been, and I folded the paper and slid it into the bowl on my table like I was storing it for a day when flames might ask to be useful again.\n\nWhen December came with its list of obligations and oranges and the traffic\u2019s costume, we bought lights. We strung them around the balcony railing like we were claiming jurisdiction over a tiny square of sky and we put a small string inside the heavy bowl like we were daring it to be ridiculous, and the glow made the fruit look like it had opinions. My mother brought us a wreath she pretended not to have made, and we hung it with a zip tie because neither of us wanted to trust ribbon, and June tied a red string around the weather radio\u2019s antenna because all gods appreciate decor. We wrote cards with messages we had earned this year because writing words to people you love knowing the weather might not let you say them later is a practice I recommend, and we put stamps on them like a choir uniform. On the night the church hosted Lessons and Carols and the sanctuary smelled like fake pine and real breath, we sat in the back and let the carols do their work, and my mother\u2019s alto was the meeting point of all the roads we had taken to get here, and when the congregation stood for \u201cO Little Town of Bethlehem,\u201d I squeezed June\u2019s hand and felt the bowl again, offered by the night to the two of us with both hands.Chapter 10\n\nThe morning after Lessons and Carols puts starch in the sky and steam on our windows, and the radio says words like wind chill with the sternness of a parent who has earned it. My mother\u2019s alto still hums in the hinge of my jaw and June\u2019s hair smells like the lobby of a church that got away with something honest. We make coffee with the reverence of people who have come to enjoy surviving, and we put the heavy bowl on the table because it has opinions about method. December asks its perennial questions\u2014whose house, which meal, what names\u2014and we answer them with compromise and a calendar and the word girlfriend lodged in our throats like a peppermint that refuses to dissolve. June\u2019s sister texts about socks versus slippers in a tone that implies jurisprudence, and my father sends a photo of a snow shovel he has repainted for the third time because tools are family in his hands, and the BA Expressway sings its winter hymn in the distance like a machine we now trust on purpose.\n\nWe plan a thing with the audacity that only new steadiness can permit. We call it Both Hands Night because we are sentimental enough to name a feeling and practical enough to invite people to stand in it. It will be a living room show and a soup line, a fundraiser for the library\u2019s banned books fund disguised as a reason to bring folding chairs into our apartment and test the architecture of what we have built. I make a list that reads like a cross between a grocery run and liturgy\u2014ladle, napkins, mic stand borrowed from the youth group, index cards, extension cord that does not want to be an optimist, Sister Evelyn\u2019s approval, three kinds of bread, a jar for the librarian who brings receipts as proof of virtue, and the heavy bowl at the center like a planet. June makes her own list that involves clay and cups and signage and the particular way she arranges light so that hands look like they always knew how to do this.\n\nThe invitations go out with the daring of people who pretend not to care how many chairs they will have to find in neighboring apartments. We text the muralist who eats granola bars like they are cigarettes and the librarian whose cardigan has been promoted to armor, the teenager Ava who learned to center by making peace with breath, Mr. Lopez because theology deserves to be brought a spoon, the man with the reflective vest who always tips at QuikTrip as if we are all a band playing his favorite song. I ask the comics who owe me fifteen minutes and a fraction of their good behavior, my mother because every room benefits from at least one person who knows when to pass you a tissue without making it a conversation, and my father because the shelf he will inevitably hang in his mind will keep the ceiling up better than the beams. June invites her students and her sister and, bravely, her father, because repair looks like stew until it looks like chairs lined up in a room that smells like onions and hope.\n\nOn the day, the sky gives us a light that believes in faces, and the apartment turns obediently into a venue because venues are simply rooms with concentrated consent. We shove the couch into the hallway, a move my neighbors accept because they also mistrust furniture that thinks it matters, and we line up chairs borrowed from the church, the plant shop, and a neighbor who insists the chairs not be used for politics but concedes that soup is bipartisan. June places cups on a folding table with a precision that convinces me of free will and arranges a small ceramic placard that reads HANDLE WITH BOTH HANDS in the script that would talk you out of a fight. I string the lights I bought in a fit of optimism around the doorway in a loop that would not satisfy my mother but pleases the room, and I tape a cable to the carpet because I want to be the kind of host who thinks about tripping hazards and metaphors. The heavy bowl sits on the dining table like a throne seat for something we don\u2019t have a name for yet, and when Sister Evelyn arrives with a pot that has to be carried by two people whose biceps are making a case for sainthood, the bowl allows itself to be filled with a confidence that makes me stand up straighter.\n\nPeople come in carrying their versions of themselves assigned to December. There are coats with ambitions and scarves that tell family stories, cheeks with weather built into them, hands ready to be offered to coats and bowls and each other. The librarian places a cardboard sign next to the bowl that says YOUR TITLES HERE, and she smuggles a plastic box of pens onto the table as if some bureaucrat might fling open the door and demand to see our literature permits. Mr. Lopez carries a tin of cookies that tastes like his grandmother used a recipe she once copied incorrectly and refused to fix because delicious mistakes deserve loyalty. The muralist leans a print of our town against the radiator, a map that refuses to obey directions, and the reflective vest men arrive in civilian sweaters and look confused by their softness until they accept that coats do not decide the policies of hearts. My mother kisses June\u2019s cheek and slips into the kitchen to wash the two dishes I have left in the sink on purpose because she measures my love in objects she can make shine, and my father checks the stability of the mic stand with the same intensity he applies to cabinets because a toppled mic is an insult to his trade.\n\nThe show begins because the soup is poured and because June touches my arm in that way that makes me understand why people bow before they open their mouths. I welcome the room like I am greeting a congregation that has woken up to find their sanctuary relocated into an apartment where the thermostat has been negotiated into kindness. I tell them I am not a pastor but I am a practitioner of timing, which is our city\u2019s second religion after weather, and I ask them to set their phones to the mode that implies we could be interrupted by only a kiss or a fire, and tonight the former is preferred. The librarian says three sentences about books and one about courage that lands softly and then refuses to leave, and the muralist reads street names off her own body and we recognize them because they have been ours long enough to become muscle memory. A comic I adore does five minutes about his grandmother\u2019s pilot light that makes me reconsider the word eternal in theologies I inherited, and Mr. Lopez mutters something to the ceiling that I cannot translate but trust anyway.\n\nJune stands up and the room tilts toward her the way wheat tilts toward wind that will not start a fight. She talks about centering and about the difference between control and conversation, and the teenagers in the room sit up like people whose bodies have just been given an alternate set of instructions. She holds up a cup and shows us the lip that forgives your mouth for being a mouth, and then she places both hands on the heavy bowl like an altar that prefers honesty to incense and says, we made this, which is a sentence I have waited all my life to attach to something that outweighs me. She tells a story about a student who thought breaking meant failure and how the kiln sometimes argues with you in a tone that requires you to answer with a jacket and a walk, and when she finishes the librarian folds her hands in the way that gets people to pay their fines and says, amen, because not all rituals need to be copyrighted.\n\nI do my set with an ear for the room we have built together, skipping the line about the elastic in her hair because it still belongs too much to the skin of the two of us and not enough to the plank we agreed to share. I talk about ice and the warming center and my mother\u2019s soap operas with scripture soundtracks and the giant cross at the highway that cannot make up its mind between billboard and benediction. I do the new line about checking the partner box and how the word sounds like we are qualified to repair fencing and also declare bankruptcy in a manner that preserves dignity, and the laugh that comes back is the good one, the one that arrives with both hands. The reflective vest men raise their paper cups in a toast that is also consent, and the teenager Ava snorts in the back because she just learned what snorting can accomplish. When I say girlfriend, I can feel the room check its pockets for the appropriate reaction and then find it: they do not applaud like a wedding, they do not cough like a jury, they simply breathe in a way that allows the word to sit on the table without flinching, and that is enough for now.\n\nWe pass the bowl for titles and money because money matters and because titles are money other people forgot to print, and the librarian whispers when she counts because whispering has always been her preferred form of celebration. People write the names of books they were told not to read and the names of people who told them to read anyway, and the cards slide against each other with a sound I would save in a jar if I could. A woman whose face looks like it has faced a winter says she has an extra space heater if anyone\u2019s house is arguing with pipes, and a man who learned to fix roofs on his father\u2019s knees offers his Saturday to a stranger because generosity is a skill you practice in public. My mother stands near the door with a basket of cloth napkins like the gatekeeper to a better table and blesses each forehead with her eyes because she never learned the fine art of letting people leave without a benediction, and my father sneaks out to tighten the screws on our coat rack because he has a thing about load-bearing declarations.\n\nThere is a flicker in the lights because December thinks it\u2019s funny and the room does what rooms do when electricity makes choices\u2014we hold very still and decide who we are in flicker. The string of bulbs pretends to be a miracle and the candles that June put into jars of beans behave like they were waiting to be invited to leadership, and someone in the back remembers a flashlight and someone else remembers that sometimes the best room is the one where you can see only as far as the next face. We do the last five minutes without amplification which feels like walking a dog without a leash and discovering it knows your name better than you do, and when I thank everyone and the librarian says she has never seen so many people look at a bowl like it was a suggestion from the future, something inside me clicks with the gentle authority of a lock that knows it is guarding something we will want back.\n\nAfter, the cleanup behaves like a family reunion we approve of. The musicians without instruments stack chairs, the teenagers wash dishes with theatrical sighs, my father finds the one wobbly leg on the folding table and tutors it toward fidelity, Sister Evelyn wraps the last of the bread in foil and tells me not to refrigerate it as if she could crawl through my fridge after midnight to correct me if I try, and the muralist stands on the balcony smoking a granola bar and telling the Christmas lights across the courtyard that they are doing good work. June and I move around each other like we have earned choreography, and when we meet at the sink with the bowl between us it feels like we are proposing to the same entity at the same time. We wash it with that attention you reserve for ceremonial objects and newborns and heirlooms from futures, and the drips run down our forearms like a blessing that got its act together. The librarian comes to the kitchen doorway to say that the tally of dollars and titles would make a city council member sweat in a good way, and I say we will deliver the bowl to the meeting like a subpoena if that\u2019s what it takes, and she says she knows where to get a lectern that does not squeak. We laugh with our backs against the counter and our shoulders at ease in a way I can\u2019t perform onstage without lying.\n\nThe guests leave in batches, the way geese take off, with a lot of neck and opinions and then elegant inevitability. The reflective vest men carry the last of the folding chairs like we are all at a wedding they agreed to slightly against their better judgment but will remember fondly, and Mr. Lopez kisses our cheeks with the gravitas of a man who trusts his theology enough to include us, and Ava asks if she can come early to class next week to wedge because she dreamed about clay last night and woke up not angry at her hands. June\u2019s father stands in the doorway like a cliff making a decision about erosion, and he says the soup is the shape he recognizes love in, and he sets a small box on the table like a confession and tells June the wrenches were his and now are hers, and they look at each other the way men and daughters do when they are building something that cannot be measured in inches. My mother says they will be home in time to turn off their porch light at a civilized hour but also to text if we cannot get the trash bags to behave, and she holds my face in her two hands for a second longer than is polite and entirely appropriate for who we have always been.\n\nWhen the door is closed and the apartment returns to pretending to be only ours, the silence sits down with us like a dog that knows better than to steal food off the coffee table. The heavy bowl glows the way glazed things do when they have been asked to mean three things at once, and June leans her hip against the counter in the posture I have started to call home. We count the napkins we didn\u2019t use and the spoons we did and the compliments we will remember when we need to refill the tank, and when we run out of practicalities, we let the next layer speak. We talk about the cousin who said girlfriend in a room that could have made it flinch and didn\u2019t, about the librarian\u2019s eyes when the cards slid into each other like siblings at peace, about my father\u2019s habit of straightening art on strangers\u2019 walls and how it is not an insult but a contribution. June says she has never had a night where all the parts of her job showed up with clean hands, and I say I have never had a set where the laugh felt like an extension cord from the kitchen sink.\n\nThere is a moment where I feel the urge to make a joke about moving in as if I am asking a dog to sit, and I do not, and then I do, because my work is to choose the timing and my life is to choose the audience. I say, quietly and entirely too late at night to write a contract, that my lease is a flexible document in the way only middle-class leases are, and that my toothbrush has been brand-loyal to June\u2019s sink for longer than it knows how to admit, and that the couch behaves better in this living room than it ever did in mine. June looks at me like the window looks at the weather, a brave thing that still wants to know if there are surprises, and she says that her closet does not know how to behave without my shoes bossing it around, and her garage has adjusted to the angle our shoulders make when we tell the wheel to wait. We do not say the word move like we are playing a game we plan to win; we talk instead about boxes because boxes are the way our people announce both ending and beginning, and we decide to start bringing them home under the guise of delivering them to other people because we respect tradition and because denial has never arranged a shelf.\n\nLater, in bed, the city breathes in the way winter towns breathe when they have learned to trust both their infrastructure and their neighbors, and the BA Expressway hums the same verse it always hums and I decide not to hate it for being reliable. June\u2019s breath sorts itself into a pattern that tells me the room can be bored again if it wants to, and I lie there counting the leftover chairs in the hallway because counting chairs is my new pacifier. I think about the next show and the one after, about the way Sister Evelyn wrote a recipe on the inside flap of my notebook because she trusts me to make the soup funny if not edible, about the librarian\u2019s hands on the bowl as she gathered the titles like grain, about my mother\u2019s palm on my face and my father\u2019s level leaning against the wall like a word I\u2019ve finally learned to pronounce. When sleep finally persuades my eyes to be kind, I dream of boxes that already know what they contain and bowls that are heavy on purpose and a city that lets us keep our small noises without demanding we perform gratitude in the key of too much.\n\nThe next morning we pick up boxes because we said we would and because it turns out boxes reproduce if you look at them directly. We find them behind the plant shop where the man with the pothos has perfected the art of shrugging and in the back of the library where the summer reading program left behind cardboard like confession, at QuikTrip where the cashier with the eyeliner points us to a stack with the solemnity of a wedding usher and refuses to let us pay in anything but gossip. We carry them up the stairs in a procession that would not impress a parade but satisfies some ancient need of mine to make labor a spectacle, and we stack them in the corner like a city block waiting for zoning. June labels one KITCHEN and one CLAY and one BOOKS and one PRIVACY because she enjoys spooking me, and I write on the top of the biggest one BOTH HANDS because we have learned it is better to instruct the future than to assume it remembers.\n\nIt is ridiculous how excited we are by tape. The sound it makes against cardboard is the crisp kind of promise that renders contracts charming, and the way it seals an edge gives me the same satisfaction as an audience whose laugh lands in the right part of the ceiling. We do not put anything inside yet because the act of assembling is the threshold and we are not obligated to cross it while the coffee is still warm. Instead we sit on the floor and lean our backs against the couch that developed loyalty to our spines and eat toast with the last of Sister Evelyn\u2019s apricot jam that tastes like a decade in a jar, and we make a small map of the closet on paper that once belonged to a brochure about civic engagement because recycling is moral when convenient. The heavy bowl sits on the stack of boxes like a mayor approving the ordinance, and when the light shifts and sets the glaze glowing, I say something too tender about municipal blessings and June laughs and calls me unbearable, which is a word I plan to pin to my sweater when I run for office.\n\nThat night I do a set in Tulsa in a room that used to be a pawn shop and currently believes in platform boots, and I bring the house a new bit about living room shows and banned books and both hands that feels exactly like the next stone on a path I didn\u2019t lay but learned to recognize. I talk about boxes and how people ask if you are leaving and never if you are arriving, and the line does that little dip my mother\u2019s voice does in a minor key, and the audience gives it back to me like a slice of cake they saved for my birthday. After, a woman in a denim jacket with prayer stitched into the cuffs tells me that the word girlfriend tasted good coming out of my mouth even from the back, and I do not correct her about distance because the idea that sound can love forward is a science I will never argue with. I drive home under a sky that has remembered it is a dome and not a lid, and the giant cross minds its business, and the BA Expressway gives me the lane like a d\u00e9nouement we have both earned, and when I unlock the door and step into an apartment where the boxes have already chosen their corners, June calls from the kitchen without turning around and says, both hands, and I say, both hands, and I carry the bowl from table to counter with the dignity of a priest who believes in jokes.",

                              "content": "Broken Arrow smells like brick dust and summer church potlucks. In the Rose District on a Friday night you can hear three different bands tuning three different wrong notes while the wind tries to convince you to go home. The bricks on Main carry heat into September, and people walk their dogs twice, once before sunset, once after, when the mosquitoes send smoke signals from the crepe myrtles. I\u2019m usually somewhere between the craft store that sells scented candles shaped like snow cones and the bar that pretends it\u2019s not a bar by offering hummus. I\u2019m usually somewhere between being someone and the punch line I\u2019ve been rehearsing about it.\n\nWhen you have to explain you\u2019re a comedian in Broken Arrow, you end up folding laundry a lot while you explain, because explaining and folding both make you look responsible. You make little rows of socks on a couch with a sinkhole in the middle and say, no, it\u2019s not just jokes. It\u2019s like\u2014storytelling, but with rhythm; it\u2019s like church but with swears; it\u2019s like sparring but you\u2019re the one both throwing and catching. Half the time you end up talking to someone who can\u2019t stay because they heard the 10 p.m. siren test is tonight (it isn\u2019t; it\u2019s always noon on Saturdays, but fear doesn\u2019t own a calendar). It\u2019s okay. I carry my own calendar in my throat.\n\nOnstage the light is close and bright and unflattering. It likes to show my pores and leave my eyes in shadow. It likes to make me a little ghostly, like I\u2019m borrowing a body I\u2019m not done paying for yet. I know exactly where to stand so I don\u2019t squeal into the speakers, and I grip the mic not like a lover or a weapon but like a handhold, like one of those barn handles you find on old doors at Reasor\u2019s when you think a bakery case might just roll open and reveal a better self.\n\nTonight, I talk about the way the giant cross on the highway is both comforting and threatening, like an ex who sends you recipes. I say, \u201cWe have more churches than stoplights and that math checks out \u2018cause every time I stop, someone\u2019s getting saved.\u201d People laugh in that cheap-seats way that tells you they want to laugh. I talk about QuikTrip, my second home, how the soda machines are a baptism if you mix them right, Dr Pepper and regret and just a splash of diet because maybe I\u2019m different now. I talk about growing up here, how the sky moves like a very slow animal, how the weather app is a horoscope with anxiety. People hunch forward and let me move inside their heads for a few minutes. I always put the furniture back where I found it.\n\nJune is at the back table, her elbow on the small wooden square like she\u2019s holding it down, like the table might float if she doesn\u2019t. June\u2019s hair is dark and has a mind that wandered off and never returned. She wears a shirt she stole from her sister, a faded navy thing with a hole near the hem that she pretends is a design feature. June laughs without forcing it, a little inward fall of sound, more breath than noise. She is my best friend, which is the easiest story to tell when the light asks a question. Onstage I call her my \u201caccomplice\u201d because it sounds less like falling.\n\nAfter the set I slide my palm under the mic stand\u2019s foot to keep it from biting me and set everything back in its upright and locked positions. The bartender gives me a nod that could mean I did a job or I did them a favor or that I exist. The light leaves without turning off and the room remembers it\u2019s a room.\n\n\u201cYou shaved, kind of,\u201d June says, when I get to her.\n\n\u201cThere was a razor in the house and it was time for our talk,\u201d I say. \u201cYou sat through the joke about the midi-length skirts of my youth. Again. I owe you a medal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou owe me a pretzel,\u201d she says. \u201cYou insulted my sister\u2019s church and the pretzel can be a crumbly apology.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretzel\u2019s on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe salt,\u201d she adds. \u201cI want extra. The salt\u2019s on you, too.\u201d\n\nWe walk out into the air that tastes like the back of a spoon. Broken Arrow at night makes a kind of stitched darkness, streetlamps sewing the thing together, and the brick glows because brick is dramatic like that. A man bikes past with a loaf of bread under his arm like a baton and no egg in the world will be safe tonight. We pass the plant shop where everything in the window looks like it could listen to you. It\u2019s early for us. We are late for people with babies.\n\nAt QuikTrip, the men in reflective vests stand in a small parliament near the coffee urns and discuss weather like weather is gossip. We order the pretzel, and I perform a minor miracle with the cheese cup, not spilling any while I pull the tray to the table we always pick, the one near the wall that pretends to be black tile.\n\nJune dips a bite and says, \u201cI love watching you be brave and also safe at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefine safe,\u201d I say, because it tickles.\n\n\u201cLike, you hold the railing with words. You stand close to the thing that won\u2019t hurt you so the thing that can is confused,\u201d she says. \u201cI envy that. I don\u2019t have that. I always take my hands off the bar right when the ride starts.\u201d\n\nWe have known each other for three years now. We met at a pottery class we both signed up for because someone\u2019s therapist\u2014hers? mine? does it matter?\u2014said it might help to make something with your hands. The room smelled like wet bread and floor cleaner, and the teacher, a thin man whose right shoulder was higher than his left shoulder, said: center your clay, center your breath, center whatever you\u2019re pretending you don\u2019t have to center. June\u2019s bowl became a plate became a flat circle became a gesture. My bowl stayed a bowl, heavy as a bad mood, and I made a joke about spooning my feelings, and June laughed like her lungs were surprised. After, we threw our pieces in the discard bin that the teacher, jovial, called \u201cthe democracy,\u201d and we went to QuikTrip, because QuikTrip is the only confession booth that takes debit.\n\nNow June licks salt from her thumb and her eyelids lower and lift in slow half-moon blinks. She\u2019s a potter still, or whatever the word is for someone who has a wheel in the garage that mostly holds other things but sometimes holds clay. The wheel came from a Craigslist ad that sounded like a breakup: \u201cNeeds a good home. Still works. Some scratches. It deserves better.\u201d She\u2019s been throwing more lately, and there are cups drying in her kitchen like a tiny congregation seeing if it can be faithful.\n\n\u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d she asks. The fluorescent lights do what fluorescent lights have always done, which is try very hard to be the sun and fail.\n\n\u201cOnly if I can tell you something back.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d she says. The salt crystals on the tray make constellations if you squint, which is how most constellations happened in the first place.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re getting better,\u201d she says. \u201cI know you hate that word. I know it\u2019s like telling a cloud it\u2019s doing a great job being a cloud. But I can see the timing shifting, like you moved your couch and suddenly you can breathe. Your breath, Rachele. Onstage it\u2019s yours tonight.\u201d\n\nI pretend to look at my phone because receiving kindness is not my talent. \u201cOkay my turn,\u201d I say. \u201cI saw your cups. The small blue one? You got the lip right. I don\u2019t know what makes a lip right, but whatever it is you wrestled it to the ground and you are standing on its throat.\u201d\n\nShe snorts and covers her mouth. \u201cGod.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not apologize for metaphor violence,\u201d I say, solemn. \u201cNot in this QuikTrip. Not while the roller grill dreams of becoming food.\u201d\n\nWe eat in the way that friends do when they have run out of stories about other people. The world is in the corner of my eye, doing its juggling. A teenager with a basketball under the counter asks for cigarettes he cannot have. A woman in scrubs buys agua fresca and a scratch ticket and a sigh. The door sussurra, lets in a new piece of night.\n\nI love June the way you love a song you can\u2019t sing along to yet because you don\u2019t know it, not in your mouth. I love June the way midsummer loves a thunderhead, suspicious and plain and wanting. I put my hands near it and then remember I am electricity and also a person, and I pull back. Instead I keep feeding it tiny coins of admiration and jokes, hoping one day the machine vends something I can name.\n\nWe leave when a group of teenagers colonize the chairs and start throwing napkins like flags. Out in the parking lot, a pickup slides past with a dog in the passenger seat sitting like he\u2019s late for a meeting. The amber light at the edge of the lot makes everything look like it might be in a memory.\n\nJune goes to her car and pulls on the door like it\u2019s pretending not to know her. There is a sound of plastic disagreeing with plastic. \u201cDon\u2019t judge my door,\u201d she says when it finally opens. \u201cIt\u2019s had a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would never judge your door,\u201d I say. \u201cI only judge your Playlist of Sad Women With Banjo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t sad,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re precise.\u201d\n\nShe drives a tan Camry with a bumper sticker that says Support Your Local Library and a small chip on the windshield that looks like a comma, as if the road asked her to pause. When she pulls out, she looks left, right, left again, like the manual taught her, like the manual was a god. She drives with both hands, ten and two, as if the car could slip out of her fingers at any second. I used to think that was cute. Now I think everything she does is a small letter to the future in case the future wants to reply.\n\n\u201cFerris wheel?\u201d she asks, one hand out her window, catching the air in its palm like it could hold it. The small traveling carnival set up a week ago on the edge of Elm Place, for fundraising something or other and the Ferris wheel is older than my father\u2019s truck and a miracle that refuses to learn about load-bearing beams.\n\n\u201cI have to write,\u201d I say, and it\u2019s true, and also the Ferris wheel makes my stomach test me. \u201cAlso I promised my mom I\u2019d stop riding things that were assembled by men named Ron in shorts.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon in shorts,\u201d she says, like a poem\u2019s first line. \u201cWe\u2019ll go tomorrow and I\u2019ll make fun of you from below.\u201d\n\nI want to say come over. I want to say I bought blueberries and forgot why. I want to say I want to fall asleep with the sound of your dishwasher like a small river I\u2019m allowed to cross. Instead, I wave like people wave in cars, like the movement could be a shield. She pulls away, and brake lights stain the asphalt for a second, and then night returns to its default setting.\n\nHome is a third floor apartment with two windows that fight about light. The ceilings are high not because the building wants to be generous but because someone mismeasured something. The carpet was beige once and now is committed to a complicated neutrality. My couch is a gray you can find in any therapist\u2019s office if you dig. The bookshelf wobbles and my landlord insists the wobble is part of the charm, as if gravity is a personality trait. I know the names of the crickets by the balcony because we share the hours. They keep time for me. I set my notebook on the coffee table and the coffee table pretends that was always its meaning.\n\nI write in long loops. I talk to myself in a voice that doesn\u2019t always like me. I make lists as if the lists can forgive me. I circle words and uncircle them. I try to put the air from QuikTrip into the paper, the way the woman in scrubs looked like a secret she was keeping, the way June\u2019s thumb was a small planet collecting salt. Sometimes I think if I just name everything carefully enough, the world will calm down. Name and tame\u2014a rhyme I should be more suspicious of.\n\nWhen I don\u2019t write, I walk. Not like the long day will vanish if I outpace it, but like walking is the opposite of erasing. I walk down to the skate park where small boys fly past like they got a memo about gravity and have chosen to respond creatively. I walk past the old train car they shoved near the museum, a thing that never moved again but still looks like it might if you looked away. I walk the parking lot of the church where my mother sings alto in a choir robe that makes her look like herself and not a substitute teacher. I walk to sleep, sometimes, and if sleep refuses, I carry on without her.\n\nMy mother calls at eleven and says, \u201cI watched that clip you sent.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom,\u201d I say, and sit down on the floor because her voice is a room with a different gravity. \u201cWas it too much? The thing about communion crackers? I can cut that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was bright,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was sharp. You have grown into yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stole that exact sentence for a joke about puberty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou steal from me all the time,\u201d she says, and I hear her smile because you can. \u201cYour grandma would have loved to argue with you about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould I have won?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says softly, \u201cbut you would have sharpened each other like knives, and that would have been a kind of love. How is June.\u201d\n\nShe always says it like that, like June is a status you order from a menu, medium rare.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s good. She\u2019s throwing,\u201d I say. \u201cCups this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw one on the Instagram. The lip was very elegant. Is she seeing anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe sees me all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cMhm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom,\u201d I say, slow as if the syllable might be the right shape. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not doing anything. I am stirring soup,\u201d she says. \u201cYou tell your jokes and I will stir my soup, and one of us is allowed to be a mother about it. Your father is building a shelf.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe cannot trick the wall into holding it,\u201d I say. \u201cThe wall knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wall is stubborn. It\u2019s where you get it. You were a stubborn baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a principled baby,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\nAfter we hang up, I watch a video of a woman making sourdough with a voiceover like rain. I wash my face and am startled, as always, that my face remains, committed to the job. I lie down and the ceiling hums. The night comes in through the small slit in the blinds like a note someone pushed under the door.\n\nMorning isn\u2019t new in Oklahoma. It\u2019s a second draft. The light is already edited. I make coffee that tastes like a very clean apology and open my notebook to the page where I scrawled dreams: a snake made of ribbon and a man I think was my fifth grade math teacher except he was a tree. I write these down because I promised a therapist once that I would try to respect the weird.\n\nJune texts at 9: a photo of a cup with a small wobble. \u201cThis one is like your laugh,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt keeps wanting to tip into a different joke.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou take that back,\u201d I text, and send a picture of my coffee mug, chipped on the lip, the chip I always forget until it cuts my mouth like a friend making a point. \u201cThis is me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlueberries are on sale,\u201d she replies. \u201cWe can become baker women who sing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are not sad,\u201d I type. \u201cThey are precise.\u201d\n\nShe sends a voice memo of her own laugh. I play it three times. It\u2019s the exact length of a heartbeat if your heart is trying to be sneaky.\n\nThe day is a rehearsal. I go to the grocery store and argue with tomatoes. I pick the line with the woman who will tell me about her child\u2019s soccer practice, because I like to hear about things I cannot fix. I stop by the library and touch the spines of books like they might touch me back. I go to the small studio where a man lets me hold a hand drum and pretend rhythm likes me. At noon, the tornado siren tests. It is a sound that makes time expand, a pressure in your head like weather has an opinion about your bones. Everyone ignores it like professionals. Everyone still looks up.\n\nAt five I let my brain do nothing in a parking lot. At six I go to the coffee shop that sells paintings of birds with eyes too human. I run my set in my head and then again in my mouth like mouth rehearsal is different. It is. Rehearsal lives in the body, not the plan.\n\nAt seven June texts. \u201cI\u2019m outside,\u201d she says. \u201cI brought the good gum.\u201d\n\nShe leans against her car like she and the car have chosen each other for now and are committed to doing the work. She has an orange in her pocket and the orange wants to be seen. We peel it before we go in and our hands smell like we went to a better place.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re wearing the jacket,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cThis is the jacket,\u201d she says. It\u2019s the denim one with the soft places where soft places matter, the elbows, the back. It\u2019s the jacket that says I live here. \u201cI want you to do the joke about the tornado drill.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just wrote the new tags.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to hear the new tags live.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what faith is,\u201d I say, and she rolls her eyes because she grew up in a house where the word faith has a shelf.\n\nTonight the bar is less of a bar because a group of church women from a nearby Bible study has decided to stay late and \u201ctry the craft beer.\u201d They look like an early morning I could love. The host gives them small cups like toddlers, and one of the women says, \u201cHoppy?\u201d like it is an accusation. They bless themselves with laughter.\n\nWhen I go up, June is in the place she always is, a little to the left. The light pretends it knows me now. I talk about the way tornado drills taught us to become furniture, to turn our backs to the glass because we didn\u2019t deserve to watch the storm want us. I talk about Okies at the grocery store when the weather decides to pretend we are endangered, all of us buying milk like that will tether the house. I talk about my father, who builds a shelf when anxious. The women from the Bible study laugh and gasp and two clap on the wrong beats and I feel enormous affection for them.\n\nHalfway through the set I make a joke about the road. I say the BA Expressway is a river and we are all paddling with paper plates. I say the way we merge is a spiritual exercise, a willingness to be seen and not crash. I mention drivers who treat turn signals like declarations of war. June\u2019s head tilts like she\u2019s learning something she thought she already knew.\n\nAfter, a man stops me to say I said something he needed. He doesn\u2019t know what it is but he needed it. He has tears he does not want to have and I offer him a napkin like I am in charge. June buys me an iced tea and we sit on the window ledge like teenagers with nowhere to be.\n\n\u201cYou OK?\u201d I say to the man\u2019s receding back because I am a late person, always arriving after the moment arrived.\n\nJune stands and stretches like a tall thought. \u201cLet\u2019s walk,\u201d she says, and my bones say yes before I make a face. We walk down Main where the brick argues with concrete and lose the sound of the bar quickly to the sound of us. The air is thick but not mean. The lamps are practicing being stars.\n\nWe pass a group of kids taking pictures in front of the mural with the big roses and the word LOVE in letters too wide. They pose like they\u2019ve seen people pose on places that tell you how to pose. I try to see the space like I saw it at thirteen, when I thought everything large was proof.\n\n\u201cDo you ever want to go?\u201d June asks, and it\u2019s the way she asks when what she means is leave, not, do you want to go to the Ferris wheel now. \u201cLike, do you ever want to sell your couch and declare your house a museum and just go?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to go all the time,\u201d I say. \u201cI want to go and I want to stay and I want both things so much I forget to do either.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought about Tulsa,\u201d she says, which is our version of Paris. \u201cJust to see. Or maybe the place with the cliffs. Or a coast, a different wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be enormous somewhere else,\u201d I say, and it comes out more tender than I planned. \u201cThis place keeps you small because it knows you. Somewhere else would have to measure again.\u201d\n\nShe bumps my shoulder with hers, which is how she says thank you when thank you is too loud. We stop at the edge of the small city park where the grass is considerate and the trees, planted by a committee, haven\u2019t decided on a mood.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think I should fall in love with someone sensible,\u201d she says, and the way she doesn\u2019t look at me is a kind of looking. \u201cLike a man who decides what to do with numbers. I should hand him my chaos and watch him stack it neatly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I met a man who could do that I\u2019d marry him first,\u201d I say, and the joke lays there obediently, waiting for the room to catch up. She laughs, the laugh I saved from the memo, and it flickers through me. I want to say, I am not sensible but I am faithful. I want to say, give me your chaos in a paper bag with a grease stain and I will wear it like a hat and we\u2019ll call it a day. I want to say, I baked those blueberries. I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t bake. The oven is a metaphor I distrust.\n\nInstead I say, \u201cYou deserve good mistakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so tired already,\u201d she says, and leans her head on my shoulder for a wild second, and we stare at the grass that has decided to be exactly what it is. Then she stands up straight like a student being called on. \u201cFerris wheel?\u201d she asks again, and it\u2019s a way of asking, do you want to do something dangerous but small.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d I promise. \u201cI have a date with a blank page, and the blank page is late and mean.\u201d\n\nShe drives me home. My building\u2019s stairwell smells like someone who once made chili and thinks it\u2019s still going on. We sit in the car with the engine a small animal under the hood, warm and needing.\n\n\u201cDo you ever think about\u2026\u201d she says, and stops.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, because I do, about everything, about the way the streetlight makes her cheek a soft coin, about the way my hands know how to be still and don\u2019t want to be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make you a bowl,\u201d she says instead, a change of subject that isn\u2019t a change. \u201cA bowl so heavy you have to use two hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike dignity,\u201d she says. \u201cLike soup for the end of the world.\u201d\n\nI go upstairs and sit on the floor and lean against the couch and the air comes in my lungs and goes. I practice saying things to the empty room. I practice not saying things. The crickets take their positions and the highway hums, far away and always near. Sleep finds me not because I am ready but because it has to, like a bus route. I ride it to morning.\n\nThe next day starts clean as paper. June sends me a photo of a bowl that is imperfect and holy. I send her a joke about storms. We promise to meet at seven at the Ferris wheel, to go up and look at our small city from the top, to wave at the church steeples and say we live here and it is enough.\n\nBefore then, there is the day. There are the errands and the texts and the small tragedies of ordinary hours. I read a poem and forget it and then remember the exact word \u201ccattail\u201d when I pass the drainage ditch. I see a woman teaching her child to ride a bike and the child\u2019s body is outrage and grace at once. I drink water and pretend it is medicinal. I stand too long in a doorway, thinking. I watch a man move a piano with three other men and a rope that I don\u2019t trust, and everything in me makes a sound.\n\nI do my set again, small and tight in the mirror. I listen to the radio because the radio is the only place someone\u2019s voice can change the day. A song about dust makes me tear up at a stop sign. I talk myself down. I call my mother to hear her tidy a drawer with words.\n\nAt six-thirty I leave, because I am a person who is not late for Ferris wheels; those are not the rides you want to rush. The sun is lower now and throws the world in relief. Moths already plan their mistakes. I drive past fields that are not fields, past houses that used to be houses. The air feels like it could crack or heal. Both are options. I am always driving through a choice.\n\nMy phone buzzes at a red light. June: \u201cRunning late. Ten minutes.\u201d The message has a typo, the word running without the second n. It\u2019s the kind of small human mistake that always makes me love us. I send her a thumbs up that pretends to be adequate.\n\nI get there and the wheel turns and turns, a slow idea against the sky. People line up and don\u2019t pretend to be patient. Kids attack the air with sugar. The woman with the cash box takes my money like she\u2019s known me a thousand years and she has. The ground under my shoes is the kind of ground you only find in places meant to be temporary\u2014pressed, uncertain, trying.\n\nI stand by the fence and practice breathing like there\u2019s a correct way. The light around everything is honey on a spoon, reluctant to let go. I imagine the top of the wheel, the way the town will look like a plan someone wrote down and kept. I imagine pointing at the library roof and saying, there. I imagine June\u2019s hand on the cool metal of the carriage, how she would make a joke about creaks, how I would pretend not to be scared. I imagine telling her a truth and not regretting it immediately.\n\nI check my phone again. \u201cOn my way,\u201d she writes. A car door slams somewhere. The wheel creaks. A little boy in a Spiderman shirt says loudly that he could jump it if he had to, and his mother says please don\u2019t, and he nods a nod that is also a plan.\n\nSomeone laughs. Someone curses, softly, in that local way where cursing is flavor not heat. Someone drops a popcorn bucket and collects the pieces and makes popcorn out of the pieces anyway because waste is a luxury.\n\nI stand there and wait, like a person in a story who hasn\u2019t learned her story yet. The light lowers. The town breathes. Seven becomes seven-ten becomes seven-twenty. June\u2019s car is not here. My phone is silent. I imagine every wrong turn. I imagine a line at the light. I imagine her stopping to look at a hawk like we do, like both of us believe hawks are omens, even on normal days.\n\nThe man with the cash box tells me how many tickets there are left because he thinks I\u2019m nervous about scarcity. I smile and say I\u2019m waiting for someone, and he says, \u201cAren\u2019t we all,\u201d and I smile the kind of smile you give when you know you\u2019re in a line bigger than the one in front of you.\n\nWhen my phone finally buzzes, it\u2019s not a text. It\u2019s a call. And it\u2019s a voice that doesn\u2019t know me, that knows my number from somewhere else, from a screen in a pocket, from a distance, and it says my name like it\u2019s asking permission to use it, and the world folds in the middle but does not break, not yet. The Ferris wheel turns like it promised. The lights along the spokes flash red, then blue, then white, then nothing like an eyelid trying to focus. A moth wings itself against my cheek and the small dust it leaves is everything I have left in that second, and I hold completely still and then I move. I\u2019m already walking. I don\u2019t know which way yet, but my body does, and I let it, I let it tell the street what it knows before my brain does, and the town looks like my hands when I\u2019m cold, all knuckle and ache, and I go.",

                              "content": "The voice says my name like it doesn\u2019t belong to me yet and asks if I know a June with dark hair and a denim jacket and a car that looks like a sentence that hasn\u2019t decided how to end. I say yes, more than yes, and the voice says there\u2019s been a thing, a small thing that isn\u2019t small, a kiss between bumpers that turned into a shove. He says she\u2019s awake, he says she said my number first, he says they\u2019re taking her to St. John Broken Arrow because that is the hospital the ambulance knows by heart. He tells me which corner to avoid because traffic has decided to turn into theater and the audience is impatient, and when I say I\u2019m coming, the word \u201ccoming\u201d feels like a muscle I forgot I had.\n\nBy the time I reach my car I find I\u2019m already moving with the surety you get when there are no options, only momentum. My keys make that dumb chime like the car is flirting, and I tell the dashboard out loud to please pay attention, like electronics respond to tone. The turn out of the lot is a needle through fabric, and the world comes in fast, broken into frames by the streetlights. I pass the Ferris wheel, which has moved from romance to satire in a single minute, and it watches me go with all its eyes. The light on Elm is red and then not; the road becomes a tongue, rough and familiar, and I am the word trying to arrive. I don\u2019t know why my brain decides to notice the teenager in a hoodie pushing a bike uphill, the way he leans into it like he believes in friction, but it is here with me, along with the smell of frying oil escaping a truck bed and the way brake lights make a grammar on pavement I understand without translation.\n\nWhen the intersection appears it is a story told wrong. The trees on the corner are pretending to mind their own business, but everyone in town knows, because everyone in town has slowed to watch, and this is a kind of prayer we practice even when we say we don\u2019t. The Camry is on the shoulder under a convinced streetlamp, and it still looks like itself, which makes my knees threateningly negotiable. The comma in the windshield has become a sentence fragment, spreading like a thought you tried not to think. A paramedic in navy and competence asks me who I am and when I say \u201chers,\u201d he nods in a way that translates into a little space where I can see June, propped and watching everything like it owes her a reason.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d she says in that breathy stage whisper people use when the stage is a gurney. \u201cI am sorry I stood you up. The airbag had plans for my face.\u201d She gestures with her eyes because her hands are doing their own choreography with straps and blood pressure cuffs, and there is a cut above her eyebrow that looks like a new constellation, and she is very, very June, which means she is making it easier for me even though I don\u2019t deserve it.\n\n\u201cYou would cancel a date with God if there was new laundry,\u201d I say, and her grin is a thing that rearranges the night. The nametag on the paramedic reads RON, because sometimes the universe likes its own jokes, and he tells me they are taking her in to keep her for a bit because her head is insisting it\u2019s fine and they don\u2019t believe heads. He says cracked radius maybe, and bruising, and her pulse is a drum with manners, and I nod as if nodding is a useful profession. I sign something with a pen that has touched too many panicked hands, and I say, like an idiot, \u201cCan she have gum,\u201d and Ron smiles with his eyes and says no gum in the ambulance, ma\u2019am, and I hate the ma\u2019am because it recognizes me and I love it because I want the world to be heavy with adults who know what to do.\n\nThe ambulance leaves like a punctuation mark and I follow it without outrunning common sense. The BA Expressway opens its throat and lets me in, and I\u2019ve never been so grateful for its brutal clarity, the way it gives you a straight line and dares you to misuse it. The giant cross at the megachurch exit is lit like an idea that refuses to sleep, and in this light it is exactly as confusing as I always say, both movie prop and compass. I think about how many times I\u2019ve made fun of the way we drive around here, and how the jokes were always a way to put my hands somewhere, a railing I could hold while the ride pretends to be wild. The siren ahead of me is a thread through fabric, pulling us toward something that is both answer and question, and when it cuts left under a sign that says Emergency it feels like we have been chosen for a team I didn\u2019t know we were trying out for.\n\nSt. John at night is a clean mouth. It smells like mint and the kind of lemon that is really just an idea of lemon, and there are women behind counters who have seen everyone in their ugliest hour and keep greeting the next person as if this is the first time they have ever watched someone arrive full of the need to be forgiven by the present. \u201cRelationship,\u201d the registrar asks, and I hate the ranginess of that word, the way it wants me to stand in a shape that might not be respected by a printer. I say friend because English has not given me a better word I can say in this foyer without melting, and she accepts it like a check that will cash. The pen on its little chain winks at me, and all the forms ask if June is allergic to peanuts and penicillin and hope, and I write no about all the things I know she can handle, and I leave blank the spaces where I don\u2019t know, because I refuse to lie to paperwork even when it is kind.\n\nThe waiting room has chairs in colors that are trying to be calm and a television tuned to a travel show where a man with a beard eats something messy and nods as if he understands a place because his mouth is full. There is the requisite woman knitting something that can forgive your wrists, and a man whose foot jiggles to a beat only he hears, and a nurse at a desk whose posture suggests she is holding the ceiling up with her spine. I sit in a place that feels like a corner without being one and discover that sitting is a verb that asks for cooperation from your heart. I text June\u2019s sister because there are vows we make without saying them and one of them is that you do not let sisters find out from the wind, and I write the words carefully like I am placing them under her door. \u201cShe\u2019s okay,\u201d I type and delete and type again because I have learned that telling people someone is okay when they are inside a medical building is like promising the weather; it is a kindness that can hit you later. I call my mother because I am now the child asking for the soup of her voice, and she answers in the way that lets me be older and younger at once, and when she says she and her choir will pray like they mean it, I believe in their breath like a quilt.\n\nIn the fourth hour of the longest minute, a doctor with a haircut like a decision comes out and says words that stop shaking almost immediately, because he is good at his work and his work includes steadiness. Concussion, he says, like a word we all know from a pamphlet, and a hairline fracture in the left radius, and bruising where life insisted upon itself too hard. He says she was lucky to be wearing her seatbelt like this is a new sacrament and I should make a note. He says they will keep her overnight because brains are drama queens who need to be humored, and tomorrow they will decide what kind of cast June gets to live with. He says I can see her because she asked for the person with the laugh that breaks in the middle, and I recognize myself even when described by someone else\u2019s listening.\n\nJune is in a room that pretends to be a room and is really a diagram of safety. There are rails on the bed like we have reached a place in the world where the bed itself needs help being a bed, and the monitor glows in the corner like someone\u2019s idea of a town. Her face is a new topography with medical tape like small bridges, and she smiles the exact smile from the parking lot after a show when someone insists on telling me about their cousin\u2019s bar mitzvah, which is to say she manages to make a space where this is not the worst thing. \u201cFerris wheel rain check,\u201d she says, and her voice plays at normal and only flinches once at the word wheel.\n\n\u201cI got you the deluxe package,\u201d I say, and hold up the hospital cup of water with a straw like it is priceless and we both know plastic is the only substance that lives forever. She gestures vaguely toward her left and winces only to keep me honest, and I pull the blanket up because there is nothing in the world more useful than rearranging fabric when you can\u2019t rearrange anything else. \u201cYou look like you fought a small handsome bird and won,\u201d I say, and she giggles, which makes the monitor add punctuation to our conversation, and I\u2019d marry that ridiculous little beep if it asked.\n\nWe talk about the stupidest things because the stupidest things can carry weight without bending. She tells me about the man who ran across two lanes to lean into her window and hold her gaze while he told her which way was up, and she says he smelled like motor oil and generosity and she trusts that combination because her father fixed things more than he hugged them. I tell her about the woman at the front desk with the rhinestone pen who said she liked my earrings like she was pinning me to the map, and I admit I almost cried in the gift shop at the sight of a plush possum wearing a stethoscope, because the world has no idea how close it always is to ridiculous. She dozes and wakes and asks for the time and makes a face when I say it and says, \u201cThis was not the miracle I ordered,\u201d and I say, \u201cDelivery services are unreliable,\u201d and she rolls her eyes and the roll is the gentlest thing I\u2019ve ever seen someone do.\n\nThere is a moment when she is mostly asleep and the monitors have decided to trust her, and I hold her hand in the way you do with people who prefer to be reminded rather than rescued. Her fingers are warm and unbroken and freckles invent themselves across her knuckles like punctuation in a poem, and I think of the bowl she promised me, the heavy one, and how some things can only be held with both hands if you want to honor them. I consider telling her the thing I practice telling the wall, the thing about wanting her near me in ways I don\u2019t even know how to catalog, but I also consider the timing and the abundance of tubes and the oxygen sensor clipped to her finger like a nightlight that refuses to go off, and I decide lust is brave but love can be patient. The chair at the side of the bed is the kind of chair dreamed up by people who hate chairs, but I fold myself into it and let my spine write new alphabets because being here is easier than being anywhere else.\n\nAt two in the morning the world becomes a hallway, and I meet it for coffee like you meet a person you dated once and decided to keep friendly. The vending machine offers choices that are not choices and I feed it a dollar like an offering to a fickle god. I end up with something that claims to be a lemon cookie and tastes like a meeting, and I eat it anyway because this is not a night that requires standards. There is a nurse who moves like a metronome, and her badge says TIFFANY even though she is fifty-five and older than the pearl I imagine in the necklace she refuses to take off, and she tells me quietly that June looks good, that she likes the way June\u2019s numbers behave when the room is bored. This phrase, the room is bored, sits down with me like a friend I didn't know I needed, and I imagine the room itself as a patient, needing us to be either interesting or stable, and tonight we have chosen stable, and tonight I owe the room a snack.\n\nJune\u2019s sister calls me back at a time of night that makes apologies into crows, sharp and unnecessary. She says she didn\u2019t hear the text because she was cutting out paper stars for her niece\u2019s school project, and the way she says stars lets me forgive every sharp thing I\u2019ve ever thought about her correctional style of love. We talk about logistics because logistics allow you to move your heart around the map without the heart realizing you\u2019ve left it behind. I tell her I\u2019m here and in love with the beep and she says she will come in the morning with socks because hospital socks are either a religion or a threat and we all have preferences, and she thanks me in the voice of a woman who is surprised to need someone and pleasantly baffled to find they were already there.\n\nAt four I walk down to the lobby to remind my body what distance feels like, and on impulse, or on muscle memory, or on the trajectory of a person who has been here before in other shapes, I go across the street to a QuikTrip that is practicing being quiet. The men in reflective vests are not in parliament because parliament sleeps eventually, but there is a single man with a newspaper folded into a language you can turn into a hat, and an older woman pouring coffee who says \u201cGood morning\u201d to me like it\u2019s a dare. I get a pretzel because something circular is required and condiments are control, and I sit for a minute under the fluorescent lights that are trying out new names. I think about June\u2019s hands in clay, the way she finds center not by forcing it but by negotiating, and I try to center myself around nothing, and it goes about as well as negotiations when both parties are stubborn and identical.\n\nBack in the room, the hospital is wrapped in the kind of quiet that still has edges. The windows let in a softness that wants to be morning, and I take the chair again because it has forgiven me. June sleeps with her mouth doing that small thing mouths do when they are busy being a body instead of a person, and I think about all the mouths she keeps, the one she uses with kids at the pottery classes she started teaching on Tuesdays when the radiators hiss and the wheel makes a sound like a child shushing itself, the one she uses with her sister when they pretend not to be the same person in two different decades, the one she uses with me, full of compromises and little fairs where I get to win prizes if I listen closely. I let my eyes close because my eyes are fragile littles who will misbehave if not given their nap, and I sleep there with my hand on the bed in the way people put their palms on the hoods of cars to feel the engine still warm, to believe in the evidence of heat.\n\nWhen I wake, it is because dawn has decided it is time for the city to remember we are alive. The narrow slice of sky I\u2019m allowed through the window blushes with a color makeup counters call something like coral promise, and the BA Expressway hums its locust song and has the audacity to be almost beautiful. The nurse with the pearl necklace brings in a tray with a plastic dome that has the self-esteem of an astronaut helmet, and June blinks at me from under her lashes like a person rejoining a conversation she never agreed to leave. \u201cSo the Ferris wheel,\u201d she says, and it feels miraculous that we still live in a world where this sentence can take up space.\n\n\u201cWe will wait until it forgets we owe it money and then we will ride it twice,\u201d I say, and she says, \u201cTwice?\u201d and I say, \u201cOnce for me and once for the part of me that didn\u2019t get on,\u201d and she laughs and then winces and then laughs at her own wincing because being human is very layered if you let it be. She eats three bites of hospital eggs that are eggs in the way a paper boat is a boat, and she declares herself a conqueror and lets me tuck the blanket again and I feel useful in a way the stage has never gotten me, which is inconvenient, to be honest.\n\nAt some point my phone tells me someone from last night\u2019s show posted a clip of me talking about tornado drills and there are comments from people I don\u2019t know saying the joke made them think about the glass they turn their backs to, and I want to go and delete the whole world and also invite them here to sit in a hospital chair and see what it means to turn toward, but I settle for a heart emoji and a promise to myself that I will not write anything I don\u2019t believe while my bones are tired. My mother texts a photo of my father holding a level like a relic and a shelf he has convinced a wall to respect, and she has added the caption \u201cStubbornness: a family heirloom,\u201d and I would like to kiss them both on their foreheads and tuck them into a shoebox labeled Persons Who Can Be Counted On.\n\nThere is a flurry of scrubs in the hall and a cheerful tech named Marisol who bends the whole day toward her smile. She wraps plaster and says things like almost there and this is going to be your temporary beautiful, and June watches her arm become a statement and says, \u201cIt\u2019s like a bracelet that means it,\u201d and Marisol says, \u201cYes, exactly, a bracelet with boundaries,\u201d and I love them enough to loan them my car. June has to pee and I become a person who helps people pee and I do it like I was born to it, and later, when she is back in the bed, she says, \u201cThank you for not narrating,\u201d and I say, \u201cI narrate for a living, I know when to let the scene breathe,\u201d and she says, \u201cYou are insufferable,\u201d and I say, \u201cCorrect,\u201d and this feels like the most honest exchange the hospital has hosted all morning.\n\nBy midday she is set free with a list of instructions that reads like a spell, and I sit with her while the nurse explains anti-nausea medicine in a tone that suggests she knows I\u2019m going to forget and call anyway. We leave with a bouquet of plastic containers and the sort of stern promises we make to strangers because we plan to break them to friends. The sunlight in the parking lot is the kind that has no use for metaphor, and I help her into my car, and she carefully arranges her body like a game of Tetris where the shapes have opinions. The seatbelt crosses her chest and she looks at it like a new religion and I consider joining, and together we drive through our city like we didn\u2019t plan on doing this today and are grateful to be allowed.\n\nAt her apartment I carry the bag the hospital gives everybody, the one that looks like a reusable grocery bag but feels like a white flag, and I open her front door with the key I have because we have arranged our lives around trust. The air inside smells like Thursday even though it is not, and the wheel in her garage sits like an animal that has been told to stay. I help her to the couch that is honest about what it has been through, and she finds a pillow for her left arm and then finds a better pillow and then finally picks the first pillow, and I put the glass of water on the right side because I have learned from experience about this particular gravity. We draw the blinds halfway because our eyes are relatives with opposing politics, and I sit on the floor with my back against her couch and open my notebook because sometimes the only way through an event is to make it earn its rent.\n\nShe closes her eyes and then opens them because she has something to say and does not trust it to stay if she waits. \u201cWhen the man leaned in and told me which way was up,\u201d she says, \u201cthe only thing I could think was, my mother would be proud that I did not panic. Isn\u2019t that stupid?\u201d She says it like she is throwing out compost that will probably turn into something useful if we\u2019re patient.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s precise,\u201d I say, and we lie there with precision like a third person in the room, small and necessary and occasionally insufferable. There is a blue shadow on the carpet that can only be made by the exact tilt of light through the slit of the blinds, and our city hums in a register only my bones can hear. Her breath evens out and I write the sentence: It is a privilege to be present for everything someone is trying to become. I write it twice because repeating makes it truer, and then I scratch it out because I am not writing for the audience today, I am writing for the machine that turns experience into the next right thing.\n\nIn the late afternoon we both sleep as if we are getting away with something. When we wake, we eat the blueberries with our hands out of the plastic clam shell because no bowl yet deserves them. We sit in our socks and watch a cooking show where everyone cries about onions and this seems like an appropriate compromise with the universe. When the light goes pink as a scraped knee, June says, \u201cNot tonight,\u201d and I say, \u201cNo, not tonight,\u201d and we share that promise like a roll at a table we finally feel we were invited to. Tomorrow I will make calls to insurance agents who believe in apocalypse more than humor, and I will stand in line at the pharmacy and make up backstories for everyone else who stands there with their small white bags, and I will drive made-of-jello slow past the intersection where the town took a breath and learned to hold it.\n\nFor now, the city softens around us like bread in a warm room. I say, without looking at her because sometimes the eyes get in the way, that we owe ourselves the top of the wheel, and she says, without looking at me because sometimes the eyes are impatient, that we will go when the man with the cash box has forgotten our faces and the moths have moved on to some other flame. We construct tomorrow out of the modest shapes available, and if the room gets bored we will tell it a joke. We will tell it about a cross that looks like a threat and a recipe and how a woman with a cast can still hold a railing with her words. We will tell it about a bowl heavy enough to require both hands and a city light enough to forgive us for not riding the ride on time, and somewhere under all of it there will be a beep, and we will let it keep time because we still plan to dance.",

                              "content": "The day after we don\u2019t ride the Ferris wheel teaches me the patience of paperwork. Insurance is a whispering chorus that refuses to harmonize, and I pace my living room trying to keep my voice in the key of polite. A woman in another time zone asks me to describe the \u201cincident\u201d and I do, carefully and without adjectives, like adjectives could make it worse. She tells me about a claim number that feels like a phone number I\u2019ll never call again, and I write it in my notebook next to a doodle of a circle with teeth. When I hang up I call the pharmacy because bureaucracy enjoys relay races, and a man with the voice of a high school bass clarinet tells me June\u2019s prescription will be ready \u201cin twenty to forty,\u201d and I ask, twenty to forty what, and he says \u201cYou know,\u201d and I do, because time in waiting rooms bends like a straw. The light in my apartment insists on being honest and my plants, anemically loyal, tilt toward it like a set of congregants who keep forgiving the sermon. I put on shoes because the day is a door that won\u2019t open unless you knock with your feet, and I go to June\u2019s to check the way her cast sits with her arm, the way the apartment sits with this new season. I bring a small bag of groceries, things that can be eaten with one hand, sandwiches that resemble strategy, a handful of nectarines because softness should be scheduled.\n\nJune has learned the weight of the cast the way you learn the weight of a new truth, by constantly bumping into it. She has tied a dish towel at the crook of her elbow like a flag that announces her left side is under construction. There is a bruise traveling down from the cut on her eyebrow like a river that decided to leave the mountain and visit the valley, and her face contains both apology and triumph, which is to say the day contains both of us. We practice the choreography of lowering and raising; we fold blankets like we have become our own grandparents. The wheel in the garage hums every time someone opens the back door, and I feel the itch in June\u2019s fingers that cannot go the way they\u2019re used to going. She briefs me on the cast\u2019s personality\u2014it hates tight sleeves, it hates door frames, it loves to be admired\u2014and I admire it properly, from several angles, like art that might be a weapon. \u201cWait until it itches,\u201d she says, a future tense that steals my breath for a second, because there is a specific kind of helplessness involved in not being allowed to scratch.\n\nAt the pharmacy, the late afternoon is a line that forgets how to move. An old man holds a paper bag like a newborn bird and tells anyone who will listen that he stopped eating grapefruit after it tried to assassinate his blood pressure. The clerk calls out names like a teacher taking attendance on the first day. I look down at the floor tiles and realize they are not straight and then cannot unsee it. When it\u2019s my turn the bass clarinet hands me June\u2019s orange bottles like they are trophies I won for endurance. I buy a cheap bouquet for the small victory of it and debate the greeting cards because there isn\u2019t a category called \u201cCongratulations on surviving someone else\u2019s mistake, also you are breathtaking with a bruise.\u201d I settle for blank and fill it with lines I will cross out three times before letting them live, and a drawing of a cast with a halo because sanctifying the inconvenient is a family sport.\n\nThat night I do a short set in a room that doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything but a room with a microphone. There are twelve people including the bartender and a woman knitting something that will save ankles in winter. I think about trying the bit about hospitals\u2014the way the monitors flirt with you and how every paper cup feels like a promise you can keep\u2014but the words wear bandages in my mouth and I don\u2019t have the right scissors. I stay with QuikTrip and the giant cross and the way we merge like we are practicing for a group project, and the laughs come in that tender middle register that means people have brought their hearts with them and are not pretending to sit with their coats. Afterward a man with hands like windshield wipers says his wife was in SAINT FRANCIS last month and he liked the eggs there, and I tell him I\u2019m adding hospital egg reviews to my set, and he says I better not because food service sued his niece once, and we both smile like we\u2019re new to language.\n\nWhen I get to June\u2019s, there is a blue bowl on the coffee table with a note under it that reads, \u201cPrototype for yours. Not heavy enough yet.\u201d The bowl wobbles slightly when I touch it, like it remembers when it was water. June sleeps with her mouth open in a way that makes me want to guard the door. Her arm is propped on a small tower of folded towels like a princess\u2019s mattress, and the cast is already smudged with her life\u2014graphite, a little flour, a fingerprint from a sauce that might be tomato or courage. I sit beside her and watch whatever cooking show the remote gave me, a French woman wearing an apron like armor coaxing soup out of things that don\u2019t want to be soup, and every time she says simmer I think of the slow anger I felt on that corner looking at the comma on the windshield unfold. I rest my hand on the couch near June\u2019s hip in a way that is both nothing and everything, and when she stirs and croaks, \u201cDid you get the good gum,\u201d I hold up the pack like a miracle and she smiles in her sleep because faith is sometimes just believing the gum will arrive.\n\nWe are not good at doing nothing, but her body demands it and I am learning obedience by osmosis. The next morning we invent a routine that could qualify as sacred if we both wore better robes. I make coffee in her kitchen that insists on being too small and she eats toast like she remembers it from childhood and not from every day since. The cast makes her right-handedness obedient and bossy, and we discover that a banana is suddenly architecture. We arrange pills in a little plastic prison that says S M T W like a church marquee, and the sound they make hitting the compartments is the sound of a tiny band warming up. When she showers I stand in the hall and tell jokes to the wall because laughter is proof of life, and she calls out for the towel and I deliver it like I was born to hand people towels at the exact moment they remember they are wet. Daylight is gentle until it isn\u2019t, and when the sun shifts into interrogator mode we close the blinds halfway and make our lives happen in that municipal kind of shade.\n\nThree days later, the town decides to test us properly. The weather radio, a small plastic loaf on June\u2019s counter that she claims was a gift from an ex-boyfriend who believed in readiness more than pleasure, screams itself awake uninvited. The sound drills a new hole in my skull and fills it with alphabet soup\u2014storm cell, rotation, debris signature\u2014which is the calm way of saying the sky has remembered it can become a hand. June and I look at each other with that particular Oklahoma smile that means we both want to panic in a charming way. The phone buzzes in sync, a chorus of concern performed by towers and satellites, and somewhere not far from us the sirens begin to pull the day into a longer shape. It is not noon on a Saturday, which means everyone becomes a professional at pretending to be hydrologically literate. We do the thing we were taught in third grade: we make ourselves small, we move to the most interior of interior places, which in June\u2019s apartment is the bathroom that has decided it is a closet\u2019s cousin. I pile the floor with towels and quilts like we are building a fort with none of the romance and all of the intention, and June lowers herself down with that careful choreography of a person who has been assigned a temporary wing.\n\nWe sit on the tile that remembers every foot that has ever been placed upon it, and the cast becomes a white animal between us. June\u2019s breath is too fast at first and then decides to copy mine, and there is no greater intimacy than breathing on purpose in a small room. The tub has a gray ring we both ignore because who we are in a storm is not who we are in a magazine. I hold my phone like a compass and tell her what the weatherman is telling me in a voice trained to be kind to frightened animals: the rotation is north, the rotation is east, the rotation is messing with the people who decided to live near that old industrial park. We remember out loud how we learned to put our backs to glass, how cafeteria ladies herded us like their most fragile breads, how the school janitor opened the door to the boiler room and became for five minutes a priest. June says she could kill for a pretzel and I say if the building remains, I will take this as a commandment and not a preference, and she laughs in the little hiccup way her laugh goes when her body is trying to participate and I want to cry because the sound is a diagnosis I can live with.\n\nThe storm doesn\u2019t visit our block in the way that creates new roofs, but it drags its fingernails across enough neighborhoods that the sirens argue with each other. At one point the power stutters and we become pioneers for a minute, the glow from the phone a new kind of candle that makes us both look like rumors. June reaches for my hand without asking her hand if it\u2019s ready, and our fingers do that embarrassing thing where they know each other faster than the rest of us does. I don\u2019t talk for a minute because I am busy asking the tinier parts of me to behave, and we sit in the tub cave and practice not thinking about everything people in our town have lost to the sky. When the thunder moves away and the rain calms itself like a dog that has decided to accept the leash again, we don\u2019t stand up right away. We stay until the room grows bored with our alive-ness, until June\u2019s phone buzzes with her sister\u2019s report from the other side of town\u2014two fences down, one lawn chair in the neighbor\u2019s pool, the tulips practicing resilience\u2014and we allow ourselves to become upright animals again.\n\nAfter a storm, everything outside looks like it was washed by someone who overdid it. The world shines a little too hard and the air carries that metallic smell that belongs to train tracks and adrenaline. I drive through puddles that want to be lakes and we make good on the pretzel promise at a QuikTrip that hums with second chances. The men in reflective vests are back in session, discussing hailstones like gossip, and someone has put a sign on the roller grill that says CLOSED FOR CLEANING, and the four exclamation points convince me the grill has seen things. We share a pretzel and the cheese cup glows like a campfire stubbornly refusing to go out, and June draws a heart on her cast with a Sharpie because moving ink over new surfaces is its own therapy. She writes the date of the storm in tiny engineer\u2019s numbers and underlines it, an annotation to the week, and I think of how we\u2019re all just margin notes pretending to be text, and I love us for it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t happen all at once, but our time accrues like lint in a pocket that refuses to empty. I start keeping a toothbrush at June\u2019s in a glass that used to hold toothpicks at some party where people dipped tiny sausages into assertive sauces, and after three days it stops surprising us. We organize her medications into small stacks that look like poker we refuse to play and set phone alarms with hilarious names like BONES and HEAD and DO NOT BE A HERO. We learn the exact angle of her couch that allows her arm to be both elevated and ignored. She comes with me to the bar on a Tuesday because she says healing requires field trips. She sits at the back with her elbow perched on a small pillow she brought from home like a wealthy 1840s woman who refuses to touch a chair with bare fabric, and I tell a soft room about the way the weatherman says \u201ctornadic\u201d like a dessert and nobody laughs and everyone nods, and at the end a woman with a face that has done a lot of looking says, \u201cI like the part where you said you put the furniture back,\u201d and I realize I did say that and also that I don\u2019t, not anymore.\n\nAt her pottery class, a group of teenagers with hands like inventions looks at June like she is both cup and kettle. She demonstrates trimming with her right hand and her voice holds all four corners of the room. Clay has never pointed out our clumsiness like this and she decides not to apologize. She tells them about centering by telling them about walking into a storm with a calm you did not pack. She asks me to stand near the splash pan and read the handout because the paper won\u2019t stay open on its own and also because I love the part where the clay remembers its water. I watch a girl discover that her bowl wants to be a spiral and swallow a laugh that would make me unwelcome. June praises a boy\u2019s cylinder like it is a small city learning its zoning laws and I fall in love with stability for the fifth time that afternoon.\n\nIt is not until a week later that we try the Ferris wheel again because people in small towns know not to test a machine that pretended at myth during a storm. The carnival packs up slowly, like it is sneaking out of a house that knows how to hold on. The wheel remains for the last night like a tooth the mouth is not ready to give the tooth fairy. We go on a Sunday when the church parking lots have exhaled and the air has that after-singing exhaustion. June\u2019s cast is now a guest book; there are signatures from her niece, from the pottery kid who made his cylinder stand up straight, from my mother who wrote a verse so tiny I had to use a magnifying app and laughed myself into a better hour when I did. The man with the cash box recognizes us in the way a cash box recognizes faithfuls, and he jokes that the wheel likes apologies. We give him two tickets and promise to treat the thing like a friend\u2019s fragile aunt, and he hands us a napkin like a talisman because sometimes napkins are all you can offer in the face of probability.\n\nThe carriage creaks in the ceremonial way it has learned from generations of creaks, and we sit side by side like conspirators who don\u2019t know the plan yet. The wheel lifts us the way a sentence lifts its clause, and the town becomes a polite map, all its problems looking manageable from the height of pretending. I see the library\u2019s roof, the train car, the church steeple that has figured out its angles, the brick that glows even at dusk because showmanship is a material. June points with her free hand and narrates her favorite corners as if she invented them: the place where the cat colony performs its political theater, the alley where the plant shop hides its overgrown, the rooftop where she once watched fireworks and decided to forgive her father for being the kind of man who fixes things instead of naming them. The wind finds us because it always does, and my stomach does its small mutiny, and June places her palm on the metal bar and says, \u201cThis is how I pray,\u201d and I say, \u201cMe too, with better lighting.\u201d\n\nAt the top, when the wheel pauses to distribute awe, the town gives us back our names and asks what we plan to do with them. I think of the night in the hospital, the beep that kept our time, the nurse with the pearl, the plaid blanket June\u2019s sister brought that made the bed honest. I think of the cross on the highway looking like a recipe I don\u2019t have the oven for. I think of the heavy bowl she promised and how some vessels are engineered to require both hands, that they\u2019re not a failure but a design. I feel the words pushing at my teeth like a crowd at a door, and I do what I always do when my body fills with sentences I can\u2019t figure out where to place: I test one quietly. \u201cYou are my favorite unsafe thing,\u201d I say, and it comes out wrong and right at once, a confession disguised as a koan. June turns her head not all the way, just enough to let me know she knows she has heard something, and she smiles the way a person smiles when she is translating herself for herself. \u201cWe should not raise children,\u201d she says after a beat, and we both laugh the laugh of people who understand the gravity of their joke and also how to survive it.\n\nWe get off the ride with knees we pretend are steadier than they are, and the ground receives us like a parent who forgot to scold. The man with the cash box winks with his mustache and I decide to love him in the precise, limited way one loves cash box men. The lot smells like dust that just remembered it was a person once, and we walk to the edge of the carnival where the trailer with the cotton candy spinner hums like a grandma who knows better. June cannot eat spun sugar with a concussion according to a study I invented, so we share a lemonade that insists on its sourness and insist back with our straws. The sky gives us a dramatic gradient it did not need to give and in return we promise not to complain about the mosquitos, and the mosquitos pretend to accept this and then conduct their business anyway because nature serves its own board.\n\nIn the days that follow, the community shows up in the ways communities do when they are both deeply themselves and accidentally holy. The church ladies bring a casserole with a topography that suggests the presence of Doritos, and my mother insists on staying to do the dishes because the dishes are the only liturgy she trusts. The neighbor on June\u2019s right whose name changes every time she tells it knocks to borrow a cup of flour and leaves with a loaf of bread she baked last week because she thinks the act of giving is a loop. The man who watched the accident calls to ask if June needs someone to mow and refuses money because he says gratitude is currency enough though I know he would not refuse a pie. The kids at the pottery studio present June with a gift: a small ceramic plaque that reads YOU ARE A BOWL WITH HANDS, and the S is backward, and I cry in the bathroom because they have accidentally written scripture.\n\nOnstage, I try the hospital bit again with a small amendment: I mention the way the registrar asked for \u201crelationship\u201d and how the word felt like standing outside a club without the right shoes. I say friend because that is the ticket that lets me in, and I make a joke about how English is a cheap landlord sometimes, and the room laughs in the good way, the way you laugh when you recognize your own lease. I talk about the sirens and how we all become furniture at once, how bravery here is holding very still and letting the storm write its bad poem without us in it. I talk about bowls that make you use both hands and a town that only looks small from the outside, and I realize halfway through that I am trying to talk the shape of my love into language that won\u2019t scare it away. June sits at the back with her elbow on that pillow like a monarch with humble tendencies and her laugh does the thing I pray for, that crack in the middle that lets the room through, and I hold the mic like a barn handle again, like the door to a better self might slide open if I am gentle.\n\nOne afternoon my father appears with a drill he pretends is a passport. He has decided June needs a shelf near her couch because books should come to you when you can\u2019t go to them, and he eyes the wall with the suspicion he saves for anything that claims to be load-bearing without proof. He finds studs like a conjurer and the shelf rises out of the drywall like a lesson. He shows June how to rest the weight of hardcovers with a cast, and she shows him how clay dries faster in this heat if you turn the pieces, and the two of them nod at each other like a handshake between species. My mother brings a jar of soup that is so exactly soup that I want to write it a thank you card, and she leaves notes in June\u2019s cabinets that say LEFT and RIGHT because she thinks it\u2019s funny to prank the future. When my parents leave they stand in the parking lot waving like people who invented waving, and June says, \u201cSometimes I forget to envy you,\u201d and I say, \u201cSometimes I forget to deserve them,\u201d and we let the evening be a neutral witness.\n\nThere is a day when June tries to put her hair in a ponytail one-handed and fails gracelessly and throws the elastic across the room with the zeal of an athlete who wants the joy but hates the sport. I retrieve it and stand behind her and gather her hair in my hands like it is a handful of creek water, and I tell my fingers to remember how to be kind. The elastic goes around twice and the third time is stubborn and I pull it with my teeth and we both stop breathing because that is the kind of intimacy even television refuses to film, and then it is done and her hair is in a silly loop that makes her look like a girl in a photo booth who made a face right before the flash. She turns and the thank you between us is louder than is polite, and I stand very still because motion would be dangerous manipulation. We do not kiss because we are both cowards and archivists; we catalogue the wanting and set it on the shelf my father hung and step away like responsible curators.\n\nBy the time the cast begins to itch, our lives have braided in ways that feel like they were always meant to. We have rules we never wrote down: if one of us says \u201clibrary,\u201d the other one puts on shoes; if one of us says \u201cRon,\u201d the other one must concoct a theory about men who assemble rides in shorts; if one of us says \u201csirens,\u201d the other one says \u201cbathroom,\u201d and we meet there with a quilt and a joke. The bowl June promised begins to take form again under her right hand, assisted by an unpaid assistant with two clumsy ones, and I learn the subtle pressure of supporting without reshaping. She calls the bowl mine out loud and I hear the word like a small bell I could marry. It is heavier this time, on purpose, and when she lifts it to the bat to be carried to the shelf, her elbow asks for help and my hands arrive without a permission slip. The act of carrying becomes a pronoun. The kiln will finish what we cannot, and when it comes out I know I will hold it with both hands, on stage, in kitchens, at QuikTrip tables that pretend to be black tile, and I will talk about how some loves require more of your surface area, how some towns teach you to grip the railing with your words, and how sometimes the ride becomes the point instead of the scenery.\n\nAt night, when sleep tries to flirt and fails, I walk. I walk past the plant shop where the owner has started leaving little notes under the pots like fortunes you can water. I walk past the mural with the roses and the word LOVE and I allow myself to think the L is for Learn and the O for Offer and the V for Velocity and the E for Enough, and I know this is sentimental in a way I would mock on stage and I do not care. I walk to the church where my mother sings, and the choir is rehearsing with the door cracked, and my mother\u2019s alto slides through the night like a spoon through cake. I walk to the place where June\u2019s car learned to reconsider and stand for a minute and let the shadow of a streetlamp run over my shoes, and I do not cry because the asphalt does not deserve the salt. I walk home and make notes on paper that already has notes, and I practice saying the thing out loud to a chair because furniture is safe. I try the sentence \u201cI love you\u201d and it fits and does not fit and the hinge of my jaw considers leaving me and then decides to stay.\n\nOn a Monday morning that looks like it was ironed, I teach June how to tie a scarf one-handed because there is a show she wants to go to in Tulsa and she refuses to be unfinished. She stands in the mirror and I stand behind her doing the kind of math you can only do with fabric, and the knot sits at her throat like gratitude. We get in my car and the BA Expressway is merciful, and the giant cross plays nice and the sky minds its own enormous business. We meet a friend of hers at a gallery that used to be an autoshop and I stand in front of paintings of landscapes that are too honest to be pretty and try to breathe in art like it\u2019s a vitamin. On the drive back we don\u2019t talk for a long time because sometimes silence is the only word that fits and I am trying not to narrate our lives so hard that I miss living them. At a red light, June says, \u201cWe are a bowl with hands,\u201d and I say, \u201cWe are a bowl with hands,\u201d and we grin at the windshield like it is an accomplice, and then the light changes and the world, obedient and wild, moves forward.",

The bruise over June\u2019s eye ripens into the kind of yellow you only see on ceramic glazes with names like cornfield and vintage lemon, and strangers have stopped giving her the soft sympathy eyes and moved into the stage where they tell her about their cousin who once broke three bones at once but still went to work the next day, like cruelty is a loyalty program you can join. She takes to carrying a wooden spoon to slide under the cotton when the itch becomes a theology, and we negotiate with it like diplomats who know the other side\u2019s demands are just a rattier version of ours. I mark dates on a wall calendar I\u2019ve brought over because my phone can\u2019t handle the gravity of recovery, and the boxes fill with appointments that have either urgency or theater depending on the time of day, and we build our week around the saw that will free her arm like a magician who promises to put the lady back together. The days are the long lake kind, lying out in front of us pretending to be wider than they are, and we learn to put a small boat on them and not overthink whether we packed oars.\n\nThe bowl comes out of the kiln on a Tuesday morning that smells like a joke about coffee and repentance. We are at the studio before the door wants to open because anticipation is an alarm that requires no snooze button, and June\u2019s right hand is a compass needle that keeps returning to the shelf where the owner stacks work like sleeping cats. The bowl is on the second tier-\u2014of course it is\u2014-sitting like it knew we\u2019d make it late if it sat any higher, and it is a color the glaze chart calls river, which feels like flattery to both water and bowl. It is heavy in my palms in the way a choice is heavy and it throws its shadow honestly, and the base has that slight rise like it remembers it was once wheel and air. There is a small crack that decided to be decorative instead of destructive and I say out loud, like a charm, that integrity is a spectrum and not a score, and June grins that dangerous grin that has gotten me through winters. She runs her fingers along the rim with the care of a person petting a skittish animal, and the bowl accepts us with the dignity of something that knows it will be useful even if we decide to worship it by accident. We write my name and the date in small letters on the underside because everything that wants to survive our houses needs archiving, and when I lift it with both hands the bowl nods, like, yes, this is the exact agreement we made.\n\nThe removal room at the orthopedist\u2019s office is bright in the way new money is bright, and there is a poster of a skeleton mid-salsa as if bone health is a party you forgot to RSVP to. The saw is a friendly horror, the tech assures us, and he demonstrates on a piece of foam the way it refuses to bite a balloon, and I cannot imagine a job where your day is convincing people you will not carve them like a ham. June laughs with her mouth and not her eyes because endurance has stages, and when the blade meets the cast it makes a sound like summer cicadas gossiping and the dust that puffs up smells like every chalkboard I ever wanted to apologize to. Underneath her arm is a pale strange cousin of her arm with hair pressed into a wave like an old-timey man\u2019s comb-over, and the skin has a map\u2019s sincerity, and the tech says it looks great and we believe him because he has been hired by reassurance. He tells us about PT like it\u2019s a party favor you earn, and he hands June a squeeze ball the color of a sin she would never commit, and on the drive home she flexes her fingers like she\u2019s practicing a chord and we both clap for different reasons at the red lights.\n\nI book Tulsa on a whim and a dare because a comedian I respect texts me that he has a slot if I\u2019m willing to drive forty minutes and pretend not to mind that the room is an old fire station that forgot to retire. June insists on coming even though I offer her a night of television that requires no posture, and we take the BA Expressway like we are auditioning for a map. The cross at the megachurch exit glows like a GPS for sinners, and I want to be annoyed but I also want to be guided, and I make a note to write a bit about religious signage being the original billboards. Tulsa sidles into us with its art deco and its bridges that look like they studied abroad, and the room turns out to be exactly as weird as promised, with hoses coiled like snakes in the corners and a vintage call box on the wall that pings occasionally like it\u2019s trying to bring ghosts to the show. I do the new hospital run and it lands in me while it lands in them, and the line about \u201crelationship\u201d gets a groan-laugh that is the sound of people seeing their own paperwork. June sits back left with a ginger ale like it\u2019s a contract and nods on the parts where I\u2019m trying to slide a feeling past my own bouncer, and after, the host tells me I found a gear he\u2019s been waiting for me to find. The drive home is one of those nocturnes where the tail lights make a parade we didn\u2019t know we needed, and in the dark June says she keeps thinking about the man who ran into traffic for her and whether he told the story when he got home, and I say maybe he doesn\u2019t tell stories, maybe he just makes shelves, and she makes a small sound like agreement and I want to put my hand on her thigh and mark the moment and don\u2019t.\n\nMy mother invites us to the church potluck with a voice that could sell real estate in heaven, and I say yes because saying yes to the women with crockpots feels like banking favor for the future. We bring the heavy bowl because it demands to be tested by starches, and June carries it in both hands like a mother walking a child to the first day of school. The fellowship hall smells like cumin and resurrection and the table is a timeline of Oklahoma casseroles from Dorito to discipline, and my mother greets June with the exact amount of gentle a person requires when introducing a bruise to a room full of opinions. June tells the choir ladies that the bowl was a collaboration because she\u2019s a generous liar, and they coo over it like it might recite Corinthians if asked. I stand with a plastic fork and listen to Sister Evelyn explain why she refuses to list mayo as an ingredient on index cards because some people don\u2019t need the whole truth, and I wonder if my whole career is just a long argument with that sentence. When the men from the deacon board lift tables in that choreographed way men in their seventies lift tables, June\u2019s eyes go soft and I know she is missing a father she has not fully forgiven, and I turn and ask my own father to tell the story about the time he put a ceiling fan in backwards so it pulled air up instead of down, because nothing fixes the present like putting a fan on it.\n\nJune\u2019s ex-boyfriend appears like weather one afternoon in the form of a text with the subject line \u201cAre you okay,\u201d which is what men write when they want to seem as if they have learned a new language and are still using the old alphabet. She reads it out loud to me in the kitchen while her coffee maker hiccups and I stare at the ceiling crack that looks exactly like a river delta and try to decide whether to be generous or strategic. He is the weather radio guy, the one who believed in go-bags and joked about earthquakes in a state that preferred its disasters visible, and he was not cruel but he was the wrong size for her life, and she replies politely and I cannot tell if the politeness is literal or a mask. After she presses send she taps the counter twice with the fingernail of her right index finger, an old June tic that means she did something brave and will probably need an aspirin for it later. I want to say things like I am here and also I am not him and I am not a plan, but the coffee is making its slow argument for patience and I decide instead to rinse the blueberries in our bowl and place them in front of her like a thesis.\n\nWe host a garage sale not because we need the money but because the objects have begun to whisper and their gossip is exhausting. June sets up a table with cups that failed their interviews and I arrange a neat grid of books I insist I\u2019m ready to let go of and then move three to a private pile like I\u2019m saving soldiers during a draft. The neighborhood arrives in shorts with small bills like hope, and a woman with a toddler buys a chipped mug and tells June she likes the way the chip makes her feel invited to be imperfect, and I watch June\u2019s eyes do the exact thing they do when she thinks about teaching. A teenage boy hovers over a set of measuring spoons for long enough that I finally say, \u201cYou a baker,\u201d and he says \u201cI want to be,\u201d like what he wants is a rebellion, and I throw the spoons in for free because the future deserves good tools. We put out a tip jar that says Hospital Humor Fund because clarity sells, and by noon it is full of wrinkled cash in the way churches like, and we count it together on the workbench while the wheel in the corner pretends not to watch. June writes THANK YOU on a piece of cardboard in her neat right-handed teacher script and tapes it to the garage door, and I have to swallow twice before I can say anything normal because gratitude is a spice that burns if you breathe it too fast.\n\nOnstage, I discover a new timing in a joke about the BA Expressway that makes me feel like I moved a couch to the other wall and the room grew a window. I talk about how merging here is a ritual of consent and how your turn signal is a half-prayer, and a man in a hat shaped like an apology laughs so hard he slaps the table and I forgive him for previously looking bored. I add a bit about hospital eggs versus church potluck deviled eggs and the comparison makes me a little nervous because I have taught myself to keep my mother\u2019s name and mayonnaise out of the same sentence, and she laughs when I tell her later and tells me to add paprika because audiences like color. June sits with both hands around a cup of ice water in a posture that would look like fear if you didn\u2019t know her, and she tilts her head when I hit the line about paperwork that decides if your love counts and I think I will die if she doesn\u2019t get it and I think I will die if she does. After the show a woman with a cardigan counting as a personality corners me at the bathroom sinks and tells me her girlfriend wasn\u2019t listed on a form once and so she didn\u2019t get a call, and I hold her hand while the faucet runs like an organ and promise her I will say the word girlfriend on stage like it is ordinary until it is.\n\nWe take a Thursday field trip to the Blue Whale in Catoosa because the internet told us it is the kind of roadside that makes memory behave, and because neither of us has a hobby that involves bats. The whale sits in the pond like someone\u2019s good idea escaped its tank, and its painted smile is less cheerful up close, the way a clown is always mostly paint. Children climb its spine with the reverence of pirates who paid admission, and a man in a gimme cap reads the plaque out loud like a poem. June stands on the little dock and leans on the rail with her good elbow and I can feel the childhood in her body, the nine-year-old who wanted to be both astronaut and potter and did not understand that both professions have a lot of cleaning involved. We walk through the whale\u2019s stomach and it is both gross and sacred, and I put my palm against the metal rib and feel the morning\u2019s heat stored there like a secret. At the gift stand we buy a sticker that says OKLAHOMA LOVES YOU MORE THAN YOU DESERVE and put it on the back of June\u2019s weather radio because we are tired of letting practicality be humorless. On the ride home we drive slow on purpose, the way you do when the day is a good dog, and we stop at a farm stand for peaches and the woman taking money calls us \u201cyou girls\u201d and for once it feels less like an erasure and more like an inheritance we can edit.\n\nA new student named Ava shows up at June\u2019s pottery class with a face that has been given too many instructions and hands that disobeyed them. She is thirteen in the posture way, head thrust forward like a turtle wearing a crown, and her grandmother waits in a folding chair with a paperback and the concentration of a saint. Ava wedges like she has an argument with the clay that began in another room, and June places her right hand over Ava\u2019s left to change the angle and it is such a simple miracle that I want to call a reporter. The wheel turns and the spiral remembers it is a spiral, and Ava\u2019s breath evens like a machine learning a song, and when the cylinder climbs up like it wants to see out the window the girl\u2019s whole face becomes an event. Later, when the room smells like damp coin adding up to a future, June tells the class to put their names on the bottoms of their pieces and I watch fourteen kids claim the underside, and I feel my chest do that thing again, the widening that always precedes a new bit and a new admission. After class, Ava lingers to ask if she can make something heavy on purpose, and June says, yes, the world requires it and I say, yes, and so do hands.\n\nThe first day we try to run again, it is not actual running, it is the negotiation two women in their thirties have with gravity when one of them has a recently freed radius and the other one has spent the last weeks learning how to be more chair than person. We go to the park where the track loops like a sentence that forgot to end, and we jog in a way that would disappoint any coach, and we applaud ourselves like the crowd you hire for morale. The teenagers in soccer camps slide past as if powered by certainties we no longer own, and the men with early retirements walk in pairs discussing boats they do not intend to purchase, and the geese are geese because nothing we do changes that. June\u2019s breath does the thing it did in the bathroom during the storm, copying mine until it finds its own rhythm, and the sun lowers like it has done this before and will do it again whether or not we participate. On lap two June says, \u201cI think my arm misses being called a wing,\u201d and I say, \u201cI have never not called it that,\u201d and she smiles without looking at me because looking would knock both of us off our line. We finish sweaty and very proud of nothing and sit on the curb to praise our knees and text my mother \u201cWe exercised\u201d and she responds with three clapping hands and a link to an article about hydration that I do not open out of respect.\n\nThe people who play trivia at the bar on Wednesdays have started calling me \u201cthe tornado girl,\u201d which is either a brand or a warning, and I lean into it like a porch in high wind. The host insists on music rounds that are mostly heartbreak disguised as choruses, and June writes our team name as Bowl With Hands even when the bartender mispronounces it on purpose, and every time I nail an answer about a 90s pop star I feel like I\u2019m a citizen again. There is a table of guys who work roofs and guess every sports question with confidence, and once when the storm sirens hiccup outside of schedule, one of them says, \u201cFalse alarm,\u201d without checking his phone, and I am both jealous and tender with the ease of his certainty. We win a $25 tab one week because I recognize a picture of a particular rumpled British author whose books smell like dust and decisions, and we buy onion rings like we\u2019re in a movie, and when the plate arrives June laughs because the onion rings are stacked in a useless tower, and I make a joke about architecture in poor neighborhoods, and the bartender shakes his head at me like he paid for my upbringing and wants a refund.\n\nOne evening, after a late show where the audience behaved like a seated storm, I go home to find a note slid under my door in June\u2019s handwriting that says, \u201cBlueberries are not currently on sale but I bought them anyway,\u201d and below it, a drawing of the bowl with an arrow pointing to its heavy and the words both hands. She has left the blueberries on my counter in a brown paper bag that has lived other lives, and I wash them in the quiet of my kitchen while the crickets pattern their night outside and the highway hums like an appliance you cannot unplug. The bowl sits on my table like a thought I\u2019m ready to think, and I pour the fruit in and they make a sound that reminds me of the way rain sometimes confesses on roofs, and I carry the bowl to the couch with both hands and set it down like a ceremony I didn\u2019t know I was licensed to perform. I eat until my mouth argues with my ambitions, and I write until my wrist complains, and I fall asleep without telling anyone, which is either progress or exhaustion.\n\nThe next morning the laundromat becomes an odd church where people pray by sorting. I go because my building\u2019s machines decided to become fountains, and June comes because she says she misses being bored in public without guilt. The place is a museum of cycles and strangers\u2019 socks, and the woman who runs it has a sign taped to the change machine that says NO SACRED OBJECTS and I spend too long wondering what happened to make that necessary. We fold together in near silence because we are ordinary in this room and it is delicious, and I teach June the fold my mother taught me that makes T-shirts behave and she teaches me the fold someone on the internet taught her that makes fitted sheets give up. A man unfolds a sheet wider than any argument and drapes it over his shoulders like a river, and outside the sky flexes its clouds and then decides to keep the day nice, and everything is so aggressively fine I have to pinch my thigh to keep from crying.\n\nWhen the local library asks me to host an open mic for their banned books fundraiser, I say yes like I\u2019m being asked to hold a baby, and June says she will help if she can be in charge of seating because she wants to put people next to people who need each other. The library at night is a different animal, all spines and secrets, and the teens who come to read are more brave than anyone I\u2019ve ever put on a stage in a bar. A kid in a denim vest reads a poem about a yard sign war on her block and a man in his sixties reads a passage from a novel about joy like he\u2019s admitting an affair, and June rearranges chairs between readers like she\u2019s officiating marriages. We pass the heavy bowl with index cards and pens and ask the room to write down a book they needed at the exact moment they weren\u2019t supposed to read it, and people write titles like contraband and slip them into the bowl like communion, and I decide to sleep with it next to my bed like a relic. After, the librarian with the hair that could defeat a tyrant thanks us both and whispers that the city council is easier when you bring snacks, and June whispers back that we can be weapons and wait staff, and I fall a little more in love with public spaces and a lot more with the person who moves through them like she invented public.\n\nI help June build a website because the kids at the studio are asking for class schedules in a tone that indicates the future expects to be able to click things. We sit at her dining table that is really just an altar to unthreatening groceries, and I try to make words like lip and foot and slip sound like invitations rather than jargon. She frowns at fonts like a general inspecting troops and chooses one that doesn\u2019t look like it will cheat on us, and we take photos of the bowl on every surface in the apartment until we learn that sunlight through that one slat of the blinds is our best cinematographer. We argue about whether to use the word shop or store, and it feels like naming a child, and we settle on shop because it asks for hands. When we publish, the internet responds the way a pond responds to a pebble, with rings that may or may not hit a shore we know, and that night a woman from Nebraska orders two cups like a dare and leaves a note that says, \u201cFor my daughters, for their hands,\u201d and June reads it three times and then once more for the part of her that doesn\u2019t read, and I sit there with my cheek on the table because I don\u2019t know how to hold this inside my head.\n\nAt a family dinner where my father grills chicken like he\u2019s cross-examining it, my mother asks a question without attaching a verb to it and everyone looks at me. The question is June and me and the room is soup and my reply is a posture, and I say that I am collecting all the words for something you can hold with both hands and that none of them are short. My sister, who likes to deliver mercy with a joke, says, \u201cI told you she would make it a paragraph,\u201d and my father brings out the level from somewhere and says, \u201cWhatever you say, let it be straight,\u201d and my mother says, \u201cOr true,\u201d and June reaches for the roasted corn and pretends she is not the weather. Later, on the porch, while the neighborhood kids run a water hose like a government, June leans on the rail and says, \u201cI am not a secret,\u201d and I say, \u201cI don\u2019t have the stomach for secrets,\u201d and we watch my parents pass a dish to each other with an ease you can\u2019t counterfeit, and I feel a small click in my chest, the sound of a hinge deciding which way it wants to swing.\n\nWhen the tulsa comic asks me to open for him on a weekend in August at a club that used to be a theater that used to be a church, I say yes because, honestly, where else am I going to learn to handle ghosts. The room is the kind that eats sound for breakfast, and the greenroom smells like murals and ambition, and I stand backstage with my hand on a curtain that has probably listened to better people and ask it to be gentle. June squeezes my arm where the muscle has been quietly building a case for itself, and I go out into heat and light and my breath does not leave me for once, it stays and behaves, and time and I enter into a contract we both sign. I talk about bowls and both hands and paperwork and sirens and the BA Expressway like it is a personality test we are all failing in the exact same way, and the laughter that comes back is organized and kind, a democracy of noise that puts me in office for fifteen minutes. After, when we drive home and the cross pretends to be only architecture, we don\u2019t turn the radio on and we don\u2019t talk because the night is a glass you should not touch until it has stopped ringing, and I think, very carefully, that I am almost brave enough to say the thing and not ask the room to forgive me.\n\nIt happens in a kitchen because of course it does. June is cutting tomatoes with her careful right hand and I am pretending not to be terrified of the knife like everyone else who has ever loved a person, and the bowl is on the counter holding cilantro with the kind of dignity herbs don\u2019t often get. The window is sweating, the way windows sweat when the outside is training for its own Olympics, and the radio is listing ingredients in a recipe neither of us will attempt. I say her name just to see how it feels in the moment right before I set something down and she says yes without looking up because we have earned that shorthand. I say, \u201cI love you,\u201d in the voice I use for weather reports\u2014measured, precise, respectful of the sky\u2019s autonomy\u2014because I refuse to hand something this serious over to drama, and the words are a bowl I have to lift with both hands. June sets the knife down the way people in movies set down guns, and she looks at me full-on like I\u2019m a painting she paid for, and then she leans her hip into the counter in the subtle way she leaves room for everything she cannot control. She says, \u201cThank you,\u201d first, which should have gutted me and instead stitched something, and then she says, \u201cMe too,\u201d and it isn\u2019t poetry and it doesn\u2019t need to be because we were never going to engrave it on a ring. We stand there with the tomatoes thinking about oxygen and how ridiculous it is that we\u2019ve been doing it right all along, and then she says, \u201cNo single-serve,\u201d and I say, \u201cBoth hands,\u201d and we laugh because we do not know how to stop, and the cilantro is triumphant and the window fogs up because the room finally got interesting.\n\nWe do not turn into other people because that would be disrespectful to the ones who got us here. We still go to QuikTrip and run into the men in reflective vests and haggle over pretzel salt as if we had not recently restructured our entire shared dictionary. We still stop at the plant shop window to admire a snake plant that knows how to survive neglect and we still talk about storms like they\u2019re relatives who might show up with their luggage. We still carry the bowl with both hands and we still make our beds on days when no one is visiting because dignity is a weekday habit. When the sirens test at noon on Saturday, we put our backs to the glass because some rituals deserve repeating even when the weather is on our side, and we let the howl move through us like a choir we didn\u2019t practice for and still somehow know. We are a bowl with hands and a town with a Ferris wheel and a cross that can\u2019t decide and a QuikTrip that keeps the lights on for anyone who can\u2019t sleep, and the line between safe and brave is the place we stand, together, with our elbows on the small tables that would float away if we didn\u2019t.",

                              "content": "The word girlfriend behaves differently in your mouth depending on the room you hand it to. At the urgent care clinic set up in the pharmacy after the city council forgot to approve a real flu shot budget, the clipboard offers me the tiny blank next to \u201crelationship to patient,\u201d and the nurse, who wears her hair in a ponytail that could double as a weapon, looks at me the way people look at checkers pieces\u2014are you going to move diagonally or not. I circle partner because it sounds like we could open a feed store if comedy goes feral, and when the nurse reads it back she does so as if she\u2019s taste-testing a spice she might introduce to her church chili. June sits on the folding chair with her sleeve rolled up, the bruise at her elbow the exact color of a defiant pear, and when the shot goes in she closes her eyes and breathes like she\u2019s on the wheel, and afterward we stand together at the free cookie table eating small sugar circles like we survived something bigger than a needle. On the way out, a man stopping by for antihistamines tells his wife loudly that the word partner is for people who run construction companies, and June takes my hand with her new right to take it and says, \u201cConstruction it is,\u201d and we walk to the car feeling like we have been issued hard hats we can decorate later.\n\nThe days lean into September the way a person leans into a screen door to hear more neighborhood. Heat holds on like a politician who doesn\u2019t know when to retire, and the brick on Main carries it around like a story it can\u2019t stop telling. The Ferris wheel has moved on in the same stealthy way heartbreak pretends it has, leaving behind a ring of ground that is both pressed and puffed, evidence of temporary joy. The Rose District starts to make early fall noises\u2014cider stands rehearsing, the plant shop bringing pumpkins to the front like new babies, school bands dragging their tubas and their faith down the street on Thursday nights. I am doing a set outside for an event someone calls an artisan night, which means soft jewelry and hard opinions, and my mic is a battery-operated stick that makes my voice sound like it couldn\u2019t wrestle a paper bag, but the crowd is willing to negotiate. June\u2019s table is a small bright republic of cups and bowls and one single platter that looks like a lake you could win at a fair, and when people ask if the heavy bowl is a gimmick she says, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a thesis,\u201d and I watch the way they nod like they\u2019ve always been hungry for a thesis they could set on their table.\n\nWe discover quickly that loving someone with two hands also means asking for their permission with two hands, left and right, comedian and civilian. The first time I tell a joke that belongs too much to June and not enough to the plank we agreed on, she catches it in the back of the room with her eyelids and sets it down gently like it\u2019s a grasshopper that wandered onto the wrong sidewalk. The line is about the day she couldn\u2019t wash her hair with one arm and I had to use my teeth to pull the elastic, and it gets a laugh that feels like people finding a secret door, and after the set we walk silently to the parking lot where the asphalt keeps receipts. She leans against her Camry and the comma in the windshield has settled into a clause, and she says, \u201cThat\u2019s mine,\u201d not like a reprimand but like a reminder of inventory. I say, \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d and I feel the small warm shame that comes when you take a cookie without asking even though the person baking them loves you and would have said yes. We stand there and edit out loud, finding the way to tell a truth without stealing it, and when we\u2019re done, we go to QuikTrip and share a soda like teenagers who both know how to drive but insist on walking each other to the door anyway.\n\nIn my mother\u2019s house the phrase \u201cWe will be in the fellowship hall\u201d means many things that are not a room where you eat, and this time it means we are eating because they are celebrating the choir director\u2019s retirement after forty-two years of telling altos not to chew their words. June arrives with the heavy bowl full of roasted sweet potatoes and rosemary, and the deviled eggs part for it like a sea with paprika, and the sound my mother makes when she sees June carrying it is the soft bell of a woman whose prayer got a tangible answer. Sister Evelyn, who runs the potluck like a benevolent judge, takes June by the elbow and introduces her to anyone who is not already a citizen of our specific universe, and I watch the way June\u2019s face practices warmth in a new dialect, a small-town hospitality that knows how to love people it can find. My father insists on showing her the shelf he hung in the church library for the mystery paperbacks that multiply like rabbits and gives her his level to hold while he points at the wall, which is masculine flirting where I\u2019m from, and she stands there balancing the instrument like she\u2019s prepared to administer sacraments to the drywall. After dish duty, which is the rite by which all my relationships are measured, my mother says quietly, \u201cI like your construction,\u201d and she squeezes my shoulder in a way the Lord never learned to do in painting.\n\nWe decide that if we can carry a bowl together we can carry a couch together, which is a lie two lesbians made famous and I am a fan of tradition. The couch I have is a gray that admits defeat every time you look at it, and we find a used one online from a woman who writes, \u201cIt did not betray us,\u201d which is the kind of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 I am immediately attracted to. It is the color of oatmeal made by an ambitious hotel and the shape of a nap, and it lives temporarily on a second-floor balcony because the woman\u2019s boyfriend has a grudge against stairs. We recruit three neighbors with the promise of pizza and the guarantee that I will find a bit about this that makes them look better than they are, and together we perform the ballet of furniture removal that involves more yelling about angles than anyone wanted. The couch scolds the stairwell with its corners and my hands discover muscles I only use when I have to argue with geometry, and when we finally get it into my living room it looks smaller, the way victory does when it sits down. We put the heavy bowl on the coffee table like a cornerstone and order too much pizza because hunger is a bully, and we eat on paper plates that have been raised to believe they are enough.\n\nBecause we are in Oklahoma and the sky has a flair for drama, there is a fall morning where the air is sly and polite and the news says frost like it\u2019s a guest we should prepare for. June wants to see the tall grass before it gives up, so we drive to the Wichita Mountains in a car that has learned to trust us. The land there looks like the earth has knuckles and the wind has opinions, and every boulder is an elder with secrets about buffalo and park rangers and teenagers who chose their locations badly. We hike in the manner of two people who have watched other people hike and believe it involves the same muscles as continuous storytelling, and the path is stubborn but fair. At a lookout that looks out over a small lake pretending to be a god, we spread a towel and eat peanut butter sandwiches like people whose vows include crunchy, and I can see the way June\u2019s shoulders unclench in front of that horizon. She tells me a story about her father teaching her to throw a softball that sounds like teaching and grief braided tight, and I tell her a story about my mother\u2019s whistle, the one that could call me across three blocks and four sins, and we discover our childhoods might have been neighbors if not geographically then in the way they made us pack snacks. On the way home, we pull over at a stand that claims to have the best peach ice cream on this side of the county line, and because I have lived long enough to know that disputes about county lines are mortal, we buy two cones and eat them too fast and look like we\u2019ve kissed a sugar ghost.\n\nOctober brings a small invitation and a larger radius. A club in Oklahoma City that used to be a Methodist church and then was a bar and now is a bar that remembers it used to be a church asks me to do fifteen minutes in front of a headliner who has an album that once helped me survive a February. The room is beautiful in the way they don\u2019t let rooms be anymore, high windows and echoes that have hugged hymns, and I stand backstage doing the math on my breath. June wants to come but her kiln has decided to be French and temperamental and she cannot ask the other potters to babysit their own work because art is a group lie that requires time management, so she kisses my cheek like it owes her money and sends me with a lucky quarter she claims she found under the mat at work. Onstage that night time behaves well and my feet remember the places on the floor where the light forgives your face, and the bit about paperwork asking who gets to be called next carries the room like a song we all knew the chorus of before anyone taught us. After, in the greenroom that still smells like lemon pledge and performative masculinity, the headliner tells me I did not rush past the quiet and I keep the sentence in my pocket like bail money. When I get back to the car there is a text from June that only says, \u201cListen,\u201d and an audio clip of her kiln firing, the low roar of it like a patient machine, and I sit in the driver\u2019s seat and play it twice and then a third time for the part of me that still doesn\u2019t think I deserve sounds that exact.\n\nOur first fight chooses a Tuesday because Tuesdays believe in themselves. It begins with a plant dying, which is the most lesbian way to begin anything outside a U-Haul contract. The snake plant in June\u2019s window decides that despite its reputation for surviving neglect and conversation about neglect, it will make a point by slumping theatrically. June blames herself with a precision that would impress a jury, and I come in too quickly with jokes about resiliency that sound brave in a bar and condescending in a kitchen. She looks at me like the table suddenly grew an edge, and she says that not every wound wants a laugh, and I say defensively that laughing is how I get the air in, and she says that sometimes I suck the air out, and we stare at each other across the poor plant like two countries who forgot where they drew the border. We do the polite thing, which is to go quiet and cut vegetables and wash knives, and our quiet has elbows. The apology happens at the laundromat because the laundromat refuses to let anyone keep a grudge when the dryers are involved, and I say I am sorry in the language of switching clothes without losing socks and she says she is tired as if tiredness were a sin, and we load a machine and make an altar out of quarters, and when our towels emerge from the heat they are warm enough to change the conversation. The snake plant gets repotted with a mix of soil the internet told us to trust, and it stands mildly improved in its new home, and we decide we will not name it because we are not gods, despite evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe library hosts a zine-making workshop in a conference room that during the day contains six quiet men pretending to study the classifieds, and we go because the flyer taped to the circulation desk has a picture of scissors that looks like joy. A group of teenagers whose hair communicates in languages we never learned arrive with backpacks full of tape and conviction, and a retired art teacher named Mrs. Petty leads us with the energy of someone who still insists you wash brushes properly. We fold paper into eighths and write small manifestos about our particular corners of the city, and June writes instructions on how to center clay that would help a person get through a divorce, and I write about the exact friction at the base of the throat when you decide to tell a true thing. At the end we trade our little booklets like baseball cards and watch each other\u2019s faces read us, and the librarian, whose cardigan has an apology stitched onto the elbow, puts out a box labeled COMMUNITY COPIES and says we can make as many as our hearts and the Xerox will let us. On our walk home, our fingers are smudged with ink and a girl on a scooter passes us like a small comet, and June says, \u201cI forgot how much cutting-and-pasting is a spiritual practice,\u201d and I say the internet is a zine with too many pages, and we both hum in agreement like a choir of two.\n\nThe kitchen has become our sanctuary and our lab, and the bowl is both our catechism and our experiment. We make a stew that begins with onions because everything true begins with onions, and we put the seasonings in like we\u2019re adding adjectives to a sentence that cannot handle adverbs tonight. The heavy bowl holds the bread dough while it\u2019s deciding whether to grow and the dough decides to be generous in a way that makes me feel personally forgiven. We eat at the table that once was a place we put mail and pamphlets from dental offices, and we set our phones in a separate room because the phones are toddlers who cannot be trusted near open flames. June tells me about a cup a student made that cracked in the kiln but did so in a way that made the damage into a line that looked designed, and I tell her about a man at the bar who apologized to me for laughing because he thinks his wife would not have liked my joke and she has been dead ten years, and we talk about how grief is a room you keep returning to even when you\u2019ve moved. After dishes we sit on the floor and lean our heads against the couch like people in an Ikea catalogue pretending to understand minimalism, and our feet touch in a way that is both ridiculous and absolutely correct.\n\nWe invent a holiday because the calendar offered a day blank enough to be arrogant. We call it Both Hands Day and all it means is we do everything slower and require two of something before we do it. Two walks, one in the brightness and one in the bruised light. Two jokes where only one would do. Two songs the radio insists on calling classics, with two choruses each sung by two voices that are both ours. We invite my parents and June\u2019s sister without telling them the title because they already suspect us of making new religions, and we set out two types of pie and two jugs of tea and two small bowls of salt because my mother cannot abide underseasoning even philosophically. In the late afternoon we take two cars down to the little park with the metal slide that conducts the sun like an orchestra, and we sit on two blankets while the kids make up a game with two rules, and my father and June\u2019s sister argue amicably about which direction the wind is from using two different apps. When the light goes soft we hold the bowl in our laps at the same time because no one wrote the commandment that says you cannot, and we pass it back and forth between knees and palms like it\u2019s teaching us something we don\u2019t have words for yet, and we light two candles when we get home because we like the way the room looks in pairs.\n\nI realize I have stopped apologizing for mentioning QuikTrip as if it were an embarrassing accent. We go on Thursdays at 9 like people who have a standing commitment to a church that sells pretzels and cold brew, and we watch the night students buy energy in cans and the men in reflective vests change shifts at the coffee urns with the grace of a relay team. The cashier with the eyeliner that could challenge a winged creature compliments June\u2019s cast graffiti as if it were a permanent tattoo, and June tells her she\u2019ll miss the attention when it\u2019s gone, and the cashier says you\u2019ll still have the jawline, and the banter is its own merit badge. The first time we go back after the confession in the kitchen, our mouths both do small unflattering things when we spot the table near the wall that pretends to be black tile, and when we sit down and the chair makes its unglamorous complaint, we realize that we have built a temple in a gas station and somehow the gods do not mind. We share a hot dog not because it is wise but because we are not always, and we laugh with our heads bowed and our shoulders up and the room winks with its fluorescent kindness.\n\nThe city introduces a new mural and demands our attention, which is how cities flirt. This one takes up the side of a building that used to sell wedding dresses and now sells artisanal pickles, and it is a map of Broken Arrow that refuses to be a map, all florals and coordinates hiding in the leaves. The artist is a woman with a buzz cut and a blog and she sits on the sidewalk eating a sandwich while a teenager holds a bucket and three mothers scold their children for touching even though the paint is on a wall thirty feet above their heads. We watch for a long time because watching people make things is the only reality television my soul can tolerate, and we talk about what we would draw if someone gave us a building and no reprimands. June says a row of bowls seen from above, which would look like planets that would rather be handled, and I say a long microphone cord winding through all the streets like a river of listening, and the artist comes down on her ladder to ask if we\u2019re planning to stay all day and we say yes like weird kids in a classroom we actually liked. In the end the mural includes a small hidden Q and a small hidden T, and I text my mother a picture with the caption that she is to blame for the way we turn everything into a treasure hunt, and she sends back a heart and a recipe and a correction for a comma I forgot.\n\nWe take a road trip that isn\u2019t to anywhere your friends would brag about on the internet because we are experimenting with a theory that satisfaction has more to do with roadside produce than vistas. We drive to a town weathered enough to be honest that has a diner called Dot\u2019s Caf\u00e9 where the floor tile is missing a square that the waitress refuses to get fixed because finding it is part of the experience. Dot\u2019s has a menu that doesn\u2019t use italics and the pancakes arrive with butter that has decided to be a sculpture, and June and I arbitrage syrup like economists trying to save a nation. On the way back we stop at a thrift store that smells like generosity and mothballs and June finds a jacket that looks like a solution, and I find a set of measuring cups that nest together like sisters who decided to be gentle this year. We pull over to watch a yard sale where a woman is selling four ceramic garden gnomes with faces like uncles and a box of VHS tapes labeled in a neat hand, \u201cDays I Want to Remember,\u201d and we buy neither because sometimes you get to leave the past in other people\u2019s driveways.\n\nThe day the paperwork catches up to us doesn\u2019t arrive with sirens or brass bands, just a letter in a window envelope that announces in its confident law firm font that we can now add each other to our emergency contacts online. We sit at the dining table like it is a court and we are both witnesses and defendants, and we type our names into a form that has the gall to ask whether we are married, and we check the box that says \u201cdomestic partner,\u201d which is a phrase that sounds like two goats in a small wagon. We ask each other questions like middle-schoolers\u2014favorite hospital, blood type, who to call if you can\u2019t call me\u2014and we answer them with a seriousness that would make our younger selves laugh and also admire us. When we hit submit, the website spins its bland little circle and then pronounces us up-to-date, and June toasts our laptops with her water glass and I cry a little bit because I am sentimental and also because the internet just made us real in a way it didn\u2019t ask permission for. We celebrate by reorganizing the spice drawer because love is glamorous exactly when you do not expect it to be, and we argue about whether cumin belongs next to coriander or paprika, and the answer is both, which is the kind of fight we trained for.\n\nMy mother invites us to a women\u2019s retreat that involves paper crafts and feelings, and she promises me that if I come, she will not make me sing \u201cOceans\u201d with my eyes closed. The church has rented a lodge that was once a 4-H camp, and the beds are obedient and the coffee smells like hospitality reclaimed from the edge. The women I grew up watching present masculine casseroles are here in leggings and determination, and they embrace June with a warmth that would make you kinder even if you arrived rude. We sit in a circle and write letters to our former selves and then read them into a paper bag to be recycled, and I write to the girl who thought her jokes were a confession booth and tell her that sometimes you are allowed to be both priest and penitent, and June writes to the girl who thought perfection was the only way to earn peace and tells her to throw a pot that looks like a hill and call it faith. After, in the small quiet of the woods that still smell like organized trees and kid breath, my mother walks with us and tells us her own story of a friend she loved and did not know how to call friend in the right way then, and the regret sits between us like a polite dog, and we pet it and send it home. On the drive back, June says retreats are weird because everyone cries in a room where folding chairs are present and I say stand-up is the same but with beer, and we laugh like we have invented the hybrid we plan to pitch.\n\nBy the time the last warm evening gets its minute, we have built a calendar that looks less like a plan and more like a quilt. Tuesdays are comedy and teenagers molding their thumbs into cylinders, Wednesdays are trivia and onion rings stacked like a metaphor for municipal budgets, Fridays are dates that involve used bookstores and the ritual of silently dividing the dollar section, Saturdays are errands that have learned to become flirting. We fit dentist appointments and oil changes and a kiln we must babysit with chairs and crossword puzzles, and we organize our time in a way that would persuade an accountant our souls are solvent. We still fight sometimes, like the morning I forgot to refill the ice tray and June accused me of not caring about the future, which is not something you should say to a comedian who built a career out of refusing to predict outcomes, and we still make up in places that don\u2019t deserve it, like the aisle with the laundry baskets in the big-box store that knows our car by sound. On the night the first cold front sighs into town and the BA Expressway shivers in its concrete, we stand on the balcony of my third-floor apartment and look out at the neon signs practicing endurance, and I hold the heavy bowl in my hands empty and watch the wind climb inside it like something it needs, and June leans her head on my shoulder and says, \u201cWe are weatherproof,\u201d and I say, \u201cWe are willing,\u201d and the crickets decide to agree because it makes their job simpler.",

The weather radio lifted its little plastic throat and gave us vocabulary we didn\u2019t want\u2014freezing rain, accumulation, downed lines\u2014and the men in reflective vests at QuikTrip were already stocking up on cinnamon rolls that could double as a currency. June set the heavy bowl on the counter like we were about to hold the sky and I pulled blankets from closets like my mother taught me that warmth is mostly preparation. The cats I do not own walked under parked cars like weather knows their names, and our neighborhood group chat turned into a recipe exchange for keeping pipes from having existential crises. We filled the bathtub with water because somewhere a grandmother still lives in both of us, and June taped the weather radio\u2019s cord to the wall so it wouldn\u2019t sulk off the counter when the power went out. The city\u2019s trees had not yet become tuned instruments but the leaves made a sound like someone trying to remember a hymn, and I felt that small thrill you are not allowed to admit\u2014disaster at a polite distance makes the blood behave\u2014right before the adult part of me did a headcount of the things we might need to keep breathing.\n\nBy morning Broken Arrow wore glass. Limbs wore sleeves that changed the way light understood them and the grass blades all held their tiny swords the way a chorus might hold candles. The air picked a temperature and committed in a way most of us never do, and the first crack we heard was not thunder or gunfire but the sound of a tree forgetting how to stand. We had done the sensible things\u2014charged, stocked, discussed, teased the idea of not being overconfident\u2014so when the lights clicked once like they were practicing and then decided to consider other opportunities, we simply became people who know how stoves behave without electricity. June lit the burners with a match like she was proposing to them, and we balanced the heavy bowl over a simmer so the dough would pretend the world was still steady. Across the hall, Mr. Lopez swore in Spanish to a god who has learned to accept feedback, and downstairs the college kid with the aquarium knocked to ask if anyone had a generator and if the generator could love fish specifically. The hallway turned into a marketplace for extension cords, opinions and the kind of neighborly banter you only bring out when the lights are down, and I found myself standing there in boots and a sweater the color of a plan, giving the laugh I give when people need to know that I am competent and will not ask for a clipboard.\n\nThe trees turned chimes by noon. Every gust got translated into a noise someone could have patented if nature believed in paperwork, and the streetlights, sleeping and upright, looked like saints on strike. We packed a go-bag because June\u2019s ex taught her to believe in readiness so hard she has a weather app that sends her poems, and I slid our important papers into a folder labeled FIRE in case irony wanted to play, and I put the bowl\u2019s receipt in there too as a joke that I had to explain to myself. The church down the street announced it would become a warming center using a font that didn\u2019t deserve that responsibility, and my mother texted a photo of the choir in coats around a piano because faith is a skill set in a power outage. We walked carefully past yards that had invented new sculptures, holding hands not because the sidewalk demanded it but because the world had shifted a quarter inch and I needed to be sure her weight was still real. The giant cross on the highway threw no shadow and looked suddenly human, a skeleton left standing when the flesh took a day off, and I wanted to tell it I understood.\n\nEveryone knows the first thing you do after you open a warming center is find the cord that will behave like an extension of your lungs. The fellowship hall filled with the smell of instant coffee and old carpet and relief, which is the same smell in every church basement from here to wherever Jesus found bowls that big. I grabbed the mic from the youth group\u2019s karaoke setup and spoke like I was calling us to order, which I was in a small way, and I found that my voice knew how to make instructions sound like an invitation. \u201cBlankets along the back wall,\u201d I said, inserting the word please because manners are a theology here, \u201chot drinks to the left, medical check-in near the coat racks, small people can color on the stage but no one ascends the drum kit like Moses.\u201d People laughed with their shoulders because their mouths were busy being alive, and June started a little assembly line of cups and ladles and whispered to every person who came through like she had their biography in her pocket. My father arrived with a toolbox like a devout man brings scripture, and he fixed a radiator with stubbornness and a borrowed coin, and I watched him work the way you watch someone do a trick that has saved you before. Sister Evelyn materialized with soup you could stand a spoon in, and I declared our bowl a community asset for the afternoon, and people dipped from it with a reverence usually reserved for sacraments and margarine at holiday dinners. The sound of branches failing made us all flinch in unison twice, and by the third time we had learned to read the pauses, and I felt the room become a single creature despite its upholstery.\n\nBy evening, the city had the look of a place that had already told all its stories once today and was willing to repeat them if we asked politely. We walked back through a neighborhood rearranged by force and gravity, and it felt like the day after a wedding where the chairs are still out and the flower petals are honest about their wilt. June carried the bowl empty the way someone carries a newborn after the first bath, with both hands and a confidence that frightened me a little with its beauty. We passed a young couple trying to free a branch from a power line with the kind of plan that would have insulted a cartoon, and I made a joke and then made a better suggestion, and they asked if we had a chainsaw like asking for a spare moon. Back at the apartment the temperature had decided to be brave, and we perched candles in jars of dried beans like Pinterest refugees because necessity is very good at convincing you it invented taste. June propped her weather radio like a small angry friend near the window and I wrapped my hands around a mug that I did not need to drink from to feel hot and called my mother to hear how many gallons of chili my father thought could solve the grid. We slept under three blankets pretending to be one, and the ice popped and the trees argued and the cat I still do not own found the stairwell and sang, and June\u2019s breath beside me recited the poem my life has been trying to write without lying.\n\nThe second day of the outage taught me a new way to count. We measured time by when the neighbor\u2019s generator coughed and when the ice finally fell from the mailbox like it had taken a core sample of our past. The heavy bowl earned its name by holding heat from the oven we woke twice to give it concept, and we ate bread that failed upward and called it rustic because naming is a kindness. The hallway evolved into barter again and I handed out the last of our tea lights like I was officiating small marriages that would last four hours if you were lucky and shorter if you breathed too hard. On our way to check on Mr. Lopez with a thermos we baptized in the sink, we found the college kid with the aquarium in tears because he had been certain about something and the fish disagreed, and June knelt in that gentle way she has and said a prayer to the god of small lives that I believed in without needing to meet. When the power came back for an hour at noon and then left again like a boyfriend with an opinion, the entire building made a noise like we were trapped under one laugh that had to turn into a curse midway through, and I found myself telling jokes in the hallway not because it was my job but because my mouth is a machine that wants to make wheels. People sat on their thresholds in coats and we became a block party of exhaustion and good-natured complaint, and when the upstairs kid asked me if I would do my set right there I did three minutes clean and learned that jokes about ice travel well if the audience\u2019s toes agree.\n\nIn the end it was the church who saved our freezer meat and the QuikTrip who saved our morale. When the power made its final return in the late afternoon, the sound filled the rooms like a dog tail and we all clapped, including my father on speakerphone because he claps at anything with the audacity to turn on. June and I looked at each other across the kitchen\u2019s restored hum like people who have been told their marriage is legal in a state that previously wanted to argue, and then we looked at the clock because the warming center needed cleaning and soup bowls needed the kind of washing that constitutes a citizenry. We walked back through a neighborhood made damp and shining and a street littered with dreams that used to belong to trees, and Sister Evelyn handed me a dishrag and informed me with love that my rinsing needed to be more persuasive. The room echoed again with the long low sounds human beings make when they remember they are temporary, and I found myself humming with the dishwasher like we had a common ancestor.\n\nThe first show after the ice landed me in a packed room that had all discovered Tuesday again. The city carried a hangover and a gratitude, and you could feel it in the way we all agreed to take off our coats and believe in non-seasonal drink orders. I ran the new bit about the warming center and the mic I used like a shepherd\u2019s crook, about the weather radio\u2019s insistence that we think in triangles, about the hallway set where Mr. Lopez heckled me with theology and I accepted because we were all clergy that day. I did the line about the giant cross without its lighting and the way we decide to love symbols with batteries, and the laugh arrived from the good part of the room, the part that hadn\u2019t decided yet what it wanted to be better about. June sat back left with her elbow on a pillow she\u2019d smuggled in under her coat and smiled with that head tilt that means she\u2019s watching the timing find itself, and when I hit the last line about both hands and the soup bowl, she let go of her breath in the way that tells me my work made a landing that I can build on. A man came up after and told me about the way his grandmother used to keep her pilot light alive with a hair dryer and faith, and I wrote the sentence down because sometimes audiences do your job for you at a level you cannot invoice.\n\nIn the quiet after the storm, the city started to ask its questions again. There were branches to haul and fences to prop and intersections to treat like conversations and the library resumed telling us what books we were late for. June\u2019s studio became a relief center for objects, with shelves of cups that now looked like survivors and bowls that demanded a second firing as if they had not been told they were enough. I sat in the corner and did my email like a person who has learned to read a claim number as if it were a poem, and June taught a class where she described how the wheel forgives you if you forgive it first, and the teenagers wedged with the seriousness of people who have been warned wisely about their wrists. Late in the afternoon a girl named Kayla cried because the lip of her bowl won, and June put her right hand over Kayla\u2019s left and told her that clay loves two chances, and the rest of the class exhaled in a room that held both anonymity and witnesses. I stood there with my notebook pretending to work and really just collected the words we are building a house with. It is a strange kind of intimacy to recognize the sentence you will tell a room later while it is being born in front of a sink with someone else\u2019s sponge.\n\nSeptember turned to a kind of October that remembered how to be generous. The school band marched past the mural practicing for a homecoming queen who would wave like a person who knows this will be written in her bones later, and the plant shop lined up a small parade of pumpkins that had been told their names already. The city announced a harvest festival with a poster that contained too many fonts and we said we would go because we are obligated to witness our town try. June got invited to set up a table with the potters and I said yes before she could consider humility, and we spent a Friday night labeling things with small numbers that looked like they remembered being lottery tickets. The heavy bowl got its own sign that said HANDLE WITH BOTH HANDS in a font my mother would approve of and Sister Evelyn would edit, and the first person who tried to lift it with one palm realized her arm was an optimist and laughed the laugh that signals future loyalty to a craftsperson. I went on at six with the sun trying out its evening colors and a mic balanced on a stand that had seen better weddings, and I talked about bowls and hands and paperwork and sirens in front of a row of hay bales that believed in splinters, and a child yelled punch line at the wrong time and I told her there\u2019s no wrong time for making friends with a noise. We closed our booth in the dark and counted our money the way pioneers must have counted their spoons after a rough winter, and June bought a jar of pickles from a man who insisted they would heal our relationship, and I said we have a jar for that already and it\u2019s called talk.\n\nA week after the ice, the city council decided to be the city council in public about art. There was an agenda item about performance permits and amplification, language that promises not to be about you until someone reads it in a tone that makes your name show up in the margins. The library sent a mass email with the subject line COMMUNITY CONVERSATION and the body of the message read like a dare from a friendly aunt, and June and I went because love is not just soup and bowls, it is also chairs and microphones and the ability to sit still in a room where some people have decided to argue with their own breath. I wore a sweater that said please but sturdier on the inside and June wore her jacket that tells the truth, and we took our seats and nodded at the people who clean our teeth and fix our shoes and teach our kids to read their own handwriting. A man stood up and asked why comedy needed to be loud, and I stood up and said my job is not to be louder than your life but to sneak inside it with permission, and a woman in a hat with a scripture embroidered around the brim asked if any of this had to do with the children, and I said all of this has to do with the children because they will inherit the room we build, and her face softened the way wheat does before it gets cut. June put her hand on my knee under the table when it was not my turn, and the head of the council rubbed his eyes in a way that said he needs more vegetables, and in the end they voted to let us keep our small noises as long as we promise not to grow up to be a stadium. We filed out with that specific exhaustion that follows civic successes that could have been failures, and on the steps we ran into the muralist eating a granola bar like a cigarette, and she nodded at us like we had pulled a nail out of her tire without asking to be mentioned in the blog.\n\nWhen my grandmother\u2019s roommate from the retirement home died, the funeral was an exercise in respect and practical hats. We drove to a chapel that has sold more tissues than space and sat with two dozen people who had known this woman\u2019s handwriting better than her handwriting knew itself. The pastor had been assigned the eulogy in the same way people are assigned casserole duty, and he told a story about a potluck in 1987 that involved an exploding microwave and the devil\u2019s urge for Tupperware, and we all laughed in the cleaned-up way you laugh when grief is in the room wearing socks. June squeezed my hand at the part where the pastor said the deceased was someone who preferred to return the grocery cart to the right place even when no one was looking, and I remembered the day I first pushed a cart into its corral and thought of my future self obligingly, and I cried because someone we did not know had made our sidewalks safer for those of us who would arrive later. After, in the fellowship hall, I found the guest book, a fetish item in Oklahoma, and I wrote our names and a sentence about bowls because that is what\u2019s left of me most days, and the family thanked us with the face people wear when they wonder if the strangers in their grief belong here and then decide anyone with hands does.\n\nThe first assignment we gave ourselves after the storm was to say the word girlfriend in rooms that didn\u2019t know whether to clap. We tried it at the pharmacy with the ponytail nurse and at the DMV where the line is a religion, and we tried it at the hardware store where my father buys screws like he is rescuing orphans, and we tried it at the church where my mother prays most of her prayers with a dust rag. Each time the word behaved differently, softened or sharpened by carpet or tile, fluorescent light or sunlight, eyebrows or none. At the plant shop, the owner got a look on her face like the pothos behind her had told her a secret, and she said, congratulations, and what do you think of that variegated monstera, and we answered with the confidence of people who had recently survived a meteorological reminder that none of this is guaranteed. At QuikTrip, the cashier with the eyeliner said, honey, of course, and gave us two extra packs of ketchup unasked, and June whispered to me that this is how institutions redeem themselves, and I nodded like a parishioner.\n\nThe radio offered me a slot on a public show about local culture because someone had decided I was local and culture, and I said yes because my mother learned who I was from church bulletins first and NPR second. The host had a voice like someone you want to invite to narrate your home movies, and he asked about the ice storm and bowls and a cross that can\u2019t make up its mind, and halfway through he asked, very gently, what it is like to love someone in a place that doesn\u2019t always know how to file the paperwork for what you feel. I smiled at the engineer window that keeps you humble and said that love is a form and a performance and a kitchen and a community and a QuikTrip, and that we don\u2019t need the room to clap as long as the room lets us find each other without pretending not to be cold. He said thank you in the way people say thank you when the word is doing push-ups, and after we were off-air he showed me his wallet where he keeps a folded photo of a man and a toddler in a pool, and I told him the water makes their shoulders happy, and he said, I know, and we stood there for a second inside a quiet that didn\u2019t want to end.\n\nWe got invited to dinner by June\u2019s father because men who fix things eventually figure out that stew is another form of repair. He lived in a house on the outside edge of town where the lawns are tired by October and the fences have evidence of teenagers leaning. He had hands that underlined and a laugh stored in that chest voice men think they invented, and he greeted June with an inspection that doubled as love. I stood in the door with my polite coat and the gift of coffee my mother insisted you bring a person who thinks filters are fancy, and he nodded at me like I had told him something printable. He asked what I do and I said I tell the truth out loud until someone cares, and he said, sounds expensive, and I said it pays in soup, which pleased him because all fathers I have ever met appreciate a barter. During dinner he asked exactly two questions that were direct and one that went in sideways and all of them said, I would like to learn how to trust what you tell my daughter you will do. June answered him with the patience of a student who has been preparing for this oral exam since childhood, and afterward we sat on the couch and watched a football game no one really believed in, and he asked me what I thought about the cross on the highway, and I told him the joke, and he laughed in that particular male way that means you have been inducted into a club that does not have a charter, and when we left he handed June a small toolbox she had left there at twenty-two, and I realized that forgiveness sometimes looks like returning a borrowed thing that never should have been kept.\n\nThe first really cold show of the season was a bonfire in a backyard with a stage made from the promise of plywood. The host had strung Edison bulbs across oaks that had recovered from the ice like veterans, and the audience sat on lawn chairs and warm beverages and a day\u2019s worth of decisions. I wore boots with soles thick enough to negotiate and a sweater my sister calls an apology, and the mic behaved like a good dog who knows where to sit. I told new jokes about soup as liturgy and paperwork as a love language, and I tried the one about saying girlfriend in rooms that can\u2019t decide if they\u2019re gyms or rec centers, and the laughter climbed over the fence and went to the next yard without asking permission because the night needed to be shared. June stood near the fire with her hands out in that old prayer and her junior-high student Ava huddled beside her throwing her chips back into the bag like she was feeding a fish. After the show a man with a tattoo of a storm cell on his forearm told me he named it after his daughter because he wanted her to remember to be big, and I nodded like the night wasn\u2019t now wanting to make me simpler.\n\nAt some point the two of us took a Sunday nap like a sacrament. The sky wore flannel and the BA Expressway hummed with its November hymn and we lay on the couch we had acquired together and fell asleep in a way I will never be able to perform onstage with integrity. When we woke, the light in the living room had moved to the spot that makes dust look like a decision, and June\u2019s hair left a pattern on my forearm that I wished I could keep in clay. We ate leftover stew from her father\u2019s house and bread we pretended to have baked on purpose, and the heavy bowl sat between us like a third presence that had begun to offer opinions. I told June that one day I want to do a show in a room that serves soup from a pot instead of from a bar, and she said one day she wants to teach a class where no one apologizes for gravity, and we wrote these things on paper that already had grocery lists on it, and the lists looked like a map of a life we had always meant to arrive at.\n\nIt was the kind of winter day where the sky wore its best stern face when the library hosted a panel on banned books that included me by accident because someone saw my bit online and decided metaphor qualified as expertise. The room was warm with coats that had given up and pockets that had held cords and cookies and petitions, and the table at the front had four people who had all been told no at some point and had looked at the word like it was plastic. A teacher talked about reading a novel to a class whispering because her principal didn\u2019t understand that whispering is holy and the librarian described the box where people can leave angry notes and the notes that weren\u2019t angry but used the same font, and I said that laughter is a way we prove to ourselves we can still move air through our bodies when what is happening asks us not to. Someone in the back asked if comedy is dangerous, and I said yes and it is also the blanket the dog will not surrender because it smells like everyone, and the audience made that sound again, the one that says we have decided, for the next hour, to tell the truth with supervision. After, we put out the heavy bowl with pens and asked for titles of books that taught people how to live inside a house with weather, and the words came in small careful handwriting like we were willing spells into being, and I wanted to drive to the city councilmembers\u2019 houses and pour the bowl onto their doorsteps like a blessing they did not ask for and cannot return.\n\nThe heater in my apartment developed an opinion about working when asked, and I called the landlord and he sent a man named RON who wore shorts because the universe enjoys the callback more than any of us do. He stood in my living room with those knobby knees that have seen too many summers and said he would persuade the unit to recall its purpose, and I made small talk about ice storms and resilience and bowl-based relationships because silence in my home while a man touches the walls makes me feel like the house will develop bad habits. He asked if the heavy bowl was an heirloom, and I told him yes, from a future we\u2019ve already met, and he laughed in that way contractors laugh when they are fond of your pipes. He left with the heater grudgingly employed and a warning about filters, and June and I changed the thermostat to a modest number that would have made my grandmother proud, and we sat on the floor in our socks eating oranges because we are determined to be a cliche that earns its keep, and the peels made the room smell like a sunny day we did not deserve, and we decided to keep deserving it for as long as we could manipulate the angles.\n\nOn a Wednesday that pretended to be Monday I forgot my set list and learned a new kind of faith. I stood in front of a room with a face and a mic with a history and I opened my mouth and asked the day to tell me what it wanted to hear, and it offered me the story of the warming center and the paperwork and the way we use both hands and the teenagers who bring their broken cylinders to a teacher with a laugh that proves there is no wrong shape. I talked about the way June touches clay like it was always a person and about the church potluck where Sister Evelyn policed mayonnaise and about how we are all keeping pilot lights alive with hair dryers and stubbornness, and the audience gave me the kind of attention that feels like a loan and a gift at once. After, I wrote the set down from memory and found the gaps where fear had been, and I folded the paper and slid it into the bowl on my table like I was storing it for a day when flames might ask to be useful again.\n\nWhen December came with its list of obligations and oranges and the traffic\u2019s costume, we bought lights. We strung them around the balcony railing like we were claiming jurisdiction over a tiny square of sky and we put a small string inside the heavy bowl like we were daring it to be ridiculous, and the glow made the fruit look like it had opinions. My mother brought us a wreath she pretended not to have made, and we hung it with a zip tie because neither of us wanted to trust ribbon, and June tied a red string around the weather radio\u2019s antenna because all gods appreciate decor. We wrote cards with messages we had earned this year because writing words to people you love knowing the weather might not let you say them later is a practice I recommend, and we put stamps on them like a choir uniform. On the night the church hosted Lessons and Carols and the sanctuary smelled like fake pine and real breath, we sat in the back and let the carols do their work, and my mother\u2019s alto was the meeting point of all the roads we had taken to get here, and when the congregation stood for \u201cO Little Town of Bethlehem,\u201d I squeezed June\u2019s hand and felt the bowl again, offered by the night to the two of us with both hands.",

My mother\u2019s alto still hums in the hinge of my jaw and June\u2019s hair smells like the lobby of a church that got away with something honest. We make coffee with the reverence of people who have come to enjoy surviving, and we put the heavy bowl on the table because it has opinions about method. December asks its perennial questions\u2014whose house, which meal, what names\u2014and we answer them with compromise and a calendar and the word girlfriend lodged in our throats like a peppermint that refuses to dissolve. June\u2019s sister texts about socks versus slippers in a tone that implies jurisprudence, and my father sends a photo of a snow shovel he has repainted for the third time because tools are family in his hands, and the BA Expressway sings its winter hymn in the distance like a machine we now trust on purpose.\n\nWe plan a thing with the audacity that only new steadiness can permit. We call it Both Hands Night because we are sentimental enough to name a feeling and practical enough to invite people to stand in it. It will be a living room show and a soup line, a fundraiser for the library\u2019s banned books fund disguised as a reason to bring folding chairs into our apartment and test the architecture of what we have built. I make a list that reads like a cross between a grocery run and liturgy\u2014ladle, napkins, mic stand borrowed from the youth group, index cards, extension cord that does not want to be an optimist, Sister Evelyn\u2019s approval, three kinds of bread, a jar for the librarian who brings receipts as proof of virtue, and the heavy bowl at the center like a planet. June makes her own list that involves clay and cups and signage and the particular way she arranges light so that hands look like they always knew how to do this.\n\nThe invitations go out with the daring of people who pretend not to care how many chairs they will have to find in neighboring apartments. We text the muralist who eats granola bars like they are cigarettes and the librarian whose cardigan has been promoted to armor, the teenager Ava who learned to center by making peace with breath, Mr. Lopez because theology deserves to be brought a spoon, the man with the reflective vest who always tips at QuikTrip as if we are all a band playing his favorite song. I ask the comics who owe me fifteen minutes and a fraction of their good behavior, my mother because every room benefits from at least one person who knows when to pass you a tissue without making it a conversation, and my father because the shelf he will inevitably hang in his mind will keep the ceiling up better than the beams. June invites her students and her sister and, bravely, her father, because repair looks like stew until it looks like chairs lined up in a room that smells like onions and hope.\n\nOn the day, the sky gives us a light that believes in faces, and the apartment turns obediently into a venue because venues are simply rooms with concentrated consent. We shove the couch into the hallway, a move my neighbors accept because they also mistrust furniture that thinks it matters, and we line up chairs borrowed from the church, the plant shop, and a neighbor who insists the chairs not be used for politics but concedes that soup is bipartisan. June places cups on a folding table with a precision that convinces me of free will and arranges a small ceramic placard that reads HANDLE WITH BOTH HANDS in the script that would talk you out of a fight. I string the lights I bought in a fit of optimism around the doorway in a loop that would not satisfy my mother but pleases the room, and I tape a cable to the carpet because I want to be the kind of host who thinks about tripping hazards and metaphors. The heavy bowl sits on the dining table like a throne seat for something we don\u2019t have a name for yet, and when Sister Evelyn arrives with a pot that has to be carried by two people whose biceps are making a case for sainthood, the bowl allows itself to be filled with a confidence that makes me stand up straighter.\n\nPeople come in carrying their versions of themselves assigned to December. There are coats with ambitions and scarves that tell family stories, cheeks with weather built into them, hands ready to be offered to coats and bowls and each other. The librarian places a cardboard sign next to the bowl that says YOUR TITLES HERE, and she smuggles a plastic box of pens onto the table as if some bureaucrat might fling open the door and demand to see our literature permits. Mr. Lopez carries a tin of cookies that tastes like his grandmother used a recipe she once copied incorrectly and refused to fix because delicious mistakes deserve loyalty. The muralist leans a print of our town against the radiator, a map that refuses to obey directions, and the reflective vest men arrive in civilian sweaters and look confused by their softness until they accept that coats do not decide the policies of hearts. My mother kisses June\u2019s cheek and slips into the kitchen to wash the two dishes I have left in the sink on purpose because she measures my love in objects she can make shine, and my father checks the stability of the mic stand with the same intensity he applies to cabinets because a toppled mic is an insult to his trade.\n\nThe show begins because the soup is poured and because June touches my arm in that way that makes me understand why people bow before they open their mouths. I welcome the room like I am greeting a congregation that has woken up to find their sanctuary relocated into an apartment where the thermostat has been negotiated into kindness. I tell them I am not a pastor but I am a practitioner of timing, which is our city\u2019s second religion after weather, and I ask them to set their phones to the mode that implies we could be interrupted by only a kiss or a fire, and tonight the former is preferred. The librarian says three sentences about books and one about courage that lands softly and then refuses to leave, and the muralist reads street names off her own body and we recognize them because they have been ours long enough to become muscle memory. A comic I adore does five minutes about his grandmother\u2019s pilot light that makes me reconsider the word eternal in theologies I inherited, and Mr. Lopez mutters something to the ceiling that I cannot translate but trust anyway.\n\nJune stands up and the room tilts toward her the way wheat tilts toward wind that will not start a fight. She talks about centering and about the difference between control and conversation, and the teenagers in the room sit up like people whose bodies have just been given an alternate set of instructions. She holds up a cup and shows us the lip that forgives your mouth for being a mouth, and then she places both hands on the heavy bowl like an altar that prefers honesty to incense and says, we made this, which is a sentence I have waited all my life to attach to something that outweighs me. She tells a story about a student who thought breaking meant failure and how the kiln sometimes argues with you in a tone that requires you to answer with a jacket and a walk, and when she finishes the librarian folds her hands in the way that gets people to pay their fines and says, amen, because not all rituals need to be copyrighted.\n\nI do my set with an ear for the room we have built together, skipping the line about the elastic in her hair because it still belongs too much to the skin of the two of us and not enough to the plank we agreed to share. I talk about ice and the warming center and my mother\u2019s soap operas with scripture soundtracks and the giant cross at the highway that cannot make up its mind between billboard and benediction. I do the new line about checking the partner box and how the word sounds like we are qualified to repair fencing and also declare bankruptcy in a manner that preserves dignity, and the laugh that comes back is the good one, the one that arrives with both hands. The reflective vest men raise their paper cups in a toast that is also consent, and the teenager Ava snorts in the back because she just learned what snorting can accomplish. When I say girlfriend, I can feel the room check its pockets for the appropriate reaction and then find it: they do not applaud like a wedding, they do not cough like a jury, they simply breathe in a way that allows the word to sit on the table without flinching, and that is enough for now.\n\nWe pass the bowl for titles and money because money matters and because titles are money other people forgot to print, and the librarian whispers when she counts because whispering has always been her preferred form of celebration. People write the names of books they were told not to read and the names of people who told them to read anyway, and the cards slide against each other with a sound I would save in a jar if I could. A woman whose face looks like it has faced a winter says she has an extra space heater if anyone\u2019s house is arguing with pipes, and a man who learned to fix roofs on his father\u2019s knees offers his Saturday to a stranger because generosity is a skill you practice in public. My mother stands near the door with a basket of cloth napkins like the gatekeeper to a better table and blesses each forehead with her eyes because she never learned the fine art of letting people leave without a benediction, and my father sneaks out to tighten the screws on our coat rack because he has a thing about load-bearing declarations.\n\nThere is a flicker in the lights because December thinks it\u2019s funny and the room does what rooms do when electricity makes choices\u2014we hold very still and decide who we are in flicker. The string of bulbs pretends to be a miracle and the candles that June put into jars of beans behave like they were waiting to be invited to leadership, and someone in the back remembers a flashlight and someone else remembers that sometimes the best room is the one where you can see only as far as the next face. We do the last five minutes without amplification which feels like walking a dog without a leash and discovering it knows your name better than you do, and when I thank everyone and the librarian says she has never seen so many people look at a bowl like it was a suggestion from the future, something inside me clicks with the gentle authority of a lock that knows it is guarding something we will want back.\n\nAfter, the cleanup behaves like a family reunion we approve of. The musicians without instruments stack chairs, the teenagers wash dishes with theatrical sighs, my father finds the one wobbly leg on the folding table and tutors it toward fidelity, Sister Evelyn wraps the last of the bread in foil and tells me not to refrigerate it as if she could crawl through my fridge after midnight to correct me if I try, and the muralist stands on the balcony smoking a granola bar and telling the Christmas lights across the courtyard that they are doing good work. June and I move around each other like we have earned choreography, and when we meet at the sink with the bowl between us it feels like we are proposing to the same entity at the same time. We wash it with that attention you reserve for ceremonial objects and newborns and heirlooms from futures, and the drips run down our forearms like a blessing that got its act together. The librarian comes to the kitchen doorway to say that the tally of dollars and titles would make a city council member sweat in a good way, and I say we will deliver the bowl to the meeting like a subpoena if that\u2019s what it takes, and she says she knows where to get a lectern that does not squeak. We laugh with our backs against the counter and our shoulders at ease in a way I can\u2019t perform onstage without lying.\n\nThe guests leave in batches, the way geese take off, with a lot of neck and opinions and then elegant inevitability. The reflective vest men carry the last of the folding chairs like we are all at a wedding they agreed to slightly against their better judgment but will remember fondly, and Mr. Lopez kisses our cheeks with the gravitas of a man who trusts his theology enough to include us, and Ava asks if she can come early to class next week to wedge because she dreamed about clay last night and woke up not angry at her hands. June\u2019s father stands in the doorway like a cliff making a decision about erosion, and he says the soup is the shape he recognizes love in, and he sets a small box on the table like a confession and tells June the wrenches were his and now are hers, and they look at each other the way men and daughters do when they are building something that cannot be measured in inches. My mother says they will be home in time to turn off their porch light at a civilized hour but also to text if we cannot get the trash bags to behave, and she holds my face in her two hands for a second longer than is polite and entirely appropriate for who we have always been.\n\nWhen the door is closed and the apartment returns to pretending to be only ours, the silence sits down with us like a dog that knows better than to steal food off the coffee table. The heavy bowl glows the way glazed things do when they have been asked to mean three things at once, and June leans her hip against the counter in the posture I have started to call home. We count the napkins we didn\u2019t use and the spoons we did and the compliments we will remember when we need to refill the tank, and when we run out of practicalities, we let the next layer speak. We talk about the cousin who said girlfriend in a room that could have made it flinch and didn\u2019t, about the librarian\u2019s eyes when the cards slid into each other like siblings at peace, about my father\u2019s habit of straightening art on strangers\u2019 walls and how it is not an insult but a contribution. June says she has never had a night where all the parts of her job showed up with clean hands, and I say I have never had a set where the laugh felt like an extension cord from the kitchen sink.\n\nThere is a moment where I feel the urge to make a joke about moving in as if I am asking a dog to sit, and I do not, and then I do, because my work is to choose the timing and my life is to choose the audience. I say, quietly and entirely too late at night to write a contract, that my lease is a flexible document in the way only middle-class leases are, and that my toothbrush has been brand-loyal to June\u2019s sink for longer than it knows how to admit, and that the couch behaves better in this living room than it ever did in mine. June looks at me like the window looks at the weather, a brave thing that still wants to know if there are surprises, and she says that her closet does not know how to behave without my shoes bossing it around, and her garage has adjusted to the angle our shoulders make when we tell the wheel to wait. We do not say the word move like we are playing a game we plan to win; we talk instead about boxes because boxes are the way our people announce both ending and beginning, and we decide to start bringing them home under the guise of delivering them to other people because we respect tradition and because denial has never arranged a shelf.\n\nLater, in bed, the city breathes in the way winter towns breathe when they have learned to trust both their infrastructure and their neighbors, and the BA Expressway hums the same verse it always hums and I decide not to hate it for being reliable. June\u2019s breath sorts itself into a pattern that tells me the room can be bored again if it wants to, and I lie there counting the leftover chairs in the hallway because counting chairs is my new pacifier. I think about the next show and the one after, about the way Sister Evelyn wrote a recipe on the inside flap of my notebook because she trusts me to make the soup funny if not edible, about the librarian\u2019s hands on the bowl as she gathered the titles like grain, about my mother\u2019s palm on my face and my father\u2019s level leaning against the wall like a word I\u2019ve finally learned to pronounce. When sleep finally persuades my eyes to be kind, I dream of boxes that already know what they contain and bowls that are heavy on purpose and a city that lets us keep our small noises without demanding we perform gratitude in the key of too much.\n\nThe next morning we pick up boxes because we said we would and because it turns out boxes reproduce if you look at them directly. We find them behind the plant shop where the man with the pothos has perfected the art of shrugging and in the back of the library where the summer reading program left behind cardboard like confession, at QuikTrip where the cashier with the eyeliner points us to a stack with the solemnity of a wedding usher and refuses to let us pay in anything but gossip. We carry them up the stairs in a procession that would not impress a parade but satisfies some ancient need of mine to make labor a spectacle, and we stack them in the corner like a city block waiting for zoning. June labels one KITCHEN and one CLAY and one BOOKS and one PRIVACY because she enjoys spooking me, and I write on the top of the biggest one BOTH HANDS because we have learned it is better to instruct the future than to assume it remembers.\n\nIt is ridiculous how excited we are by tape. The sound it makes against cardboard is the crisp kind of promise that renders contracts charming, and the way it seals an edge gives me the same satisfaction as an audience whose laugh lands in the right part of the ceiling. We do not put anything inside yet because the act of assembling is the threshold and we are not obligated to cross it while the coffee is still warm. Instead we sit on the floor and lean our backs against the couch that developed loyalty to our spines and eat toast with the last of Sister Evelyn\u2019s apricot jam that tastes like a decade in a jar, and we make a small map of the closet on paper that once belonged to a brochure about civic engagement because recycling is moral when convenient. The heavy bowl sits on the stack of boxes like a mayor approving the ordinance, and when the light shifts and sets the glaze glowing, I say something too tender about municipal blessings and June laughs and calls me unbearable, which is a word I plan to pin to my sweater when I run for office.\n\nThat night I do a set in Tulsa in a room that used to be a pawn shop and currently believes in platform boots, and I bring the house a new bit about living room shows and banned books and both hands that feels exactly like the next stone on a path I didn\u2019t lay but learned to recognize. I talk about boxes and how people ask if you are leaving and never if you are arriving, and the line does that little dip my mother\u2019s voice does in a minor key, and the audience gives it back to me like a slice of cake they saved for my birthday. After, a woman in a denim jacket with prayer stitched into the cuffs tells me that the word girlfriend tasted good coming out of my mouth even from the back, and I do not correct her about distance because the idea that sound can love forward is a science I will never argue with. I drive home under a sky that has remembered it is a dome and not a lid, and the giant cross minds its business, and the BA Expressway gives me the lane like a d\u00e9nouement we have both earned, and when I unlock the door and step into an apartment where the boxes have already chosen their corners, June calls from the kitchen without turning around and says, both hands, and I say, both hands, and I carry the bowl from table to counter with the dignity of a priest who believes in jokes.",
