     "novel_text": "The morning bells at Saint Apollonia of the Veil were tuned to the fog. There was a softness to their ringing that made the air itself seem woolen, like a shawl pulled over the town of Salem and its mounded roofs and sleeping gutters. Ulriche stood beneath the cloister arch as their notes braided into one another and turned a moment into something she could step through. Autumn had begun to salt the trees in the courtyard with yellow and rust; the gravel gave back the faintest sigh whenever she turned her foot.\n\nA squirrel sat on the rain barrel, tail furred up like a question mark. It was not yet afraid of her, and she felt grateful, foolishly, to be trusted by something quick. \u201cYou\u2019re always up early,\u201d she told it, and the squirrel cocked its head as if considering whether morning talk from a woman in a black veil was allowed in the kingdom of leaves. A few crumbs were in her pocket from a loaf Sister Agnes had cut badly and abandoned on the board. She scattered them, and the squirrel skittered down, nails clicking lightly, like pins shaken in a tin.\n\n\u201cBread for animals,\u201d said Sister Agnes, appearing at Ulriche\u2019s left shoulder without noise. \u201cBread isn\u2019t ours to spare.\u201d\n\n\u201cBread is God\u2019s,\u201d Ulriche murmured, surprised at herself for saying it aloud. She glanced sideways and saw only the wall, whitewashed, pocked with small shadows that looked like thumbprints. Sister Agnes had already gone or had never been there or had spoken without being seen. It happened like that, now and then. She made a note to ask Father Oliver if there was a rule about speaking to squirrels at dawn or arguing about bread with a woman who wore her rosary too tight.\n\nShe steadied her basket under the crook of her arm and stepped into the garden beds. The earth had the warmth of someone recently risen. A gardener was working the far row, a man so much part of the garden that she could imagine he had put his hand in loam and it had raised him up like a seed. His back was to her. The sun, such as it was, threw a pale loop around him: a halo put on wrong, from behind, too low. When he straightened and turned, she knew him because she had been told about him, the new man the parish had hired while Brother Patric\u2019s lungs healed. His name was Elias Hart.\n\nHe took off his cap in the presence of any nun, not just the prioress. \u201cSister,\u201d he said, a greeting and a question.\n\n\u201cUlriche,\u201d she said, and then, realizing that this was a fact too large to carry on the tip of politeness, added, \u201cSister Ulriche. The library.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe library,\u201d he echoed, as if it were a location on a map not often visited. A smile. He was younger than she\u2019d expected, older than she would have wanted someone else to be. The lines around his mouth were the sort plowed by weather rather than grief. \u201cMother Heloise said you\u2019d come for rosemary. The kitchen asked for it, and I am slowly learning how much rosemary is too much. I was told you would know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey tell you correct things sometimes,\u201d Ulriche said. Her words came out a little crooked; she felt the unkind heat of it in her face and turned to the herb bed, which had gotten ambitious and sent up its own ideas of where it belonged. She tore off a length, then another, then forced herself to stop, though the tearing was a small sickness and cure both. \u201cRosemary likes the dry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dry,\u201d he repeated, and she knew he was not mockingly echoing her but rather setting her advice behind a door in his head where he could find it later. She wanted to be that door, or the cupboard built into the wall beside it, holding jars she had labeled in her neatest hand.\n\n\u201cElias,\u201d said a voice, something like wind caught in the keyhole. It was Sister Verna; it was also the sound of his name leaving Ulriche\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d He looked at her with a readiness that startled her, like someone called out of a lake who has no time to towel off.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d She pushed the rosemary into her basket and found a sprig stuck to the cuff of her sleeve. She did not remove it, because it seemed happier there, like an ornament from a childish festival.\n\n\u201cBrother Flint says the compost will heat too hot if you keep turning it,\u201d Elias said, gentle, as though continuing a discussion that had wandered off to find its dog. \u201cBut the rats\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no Brother Flint,\u201d Ulriche said. It came out too quick. He blinked, then nodded, deferential, as if he had meant something else and had chosen the wrong word entirely. She felt the heaviness of her veil against her ear and heard the small friction of cloth. \u201cThere is,\u201d she amended, adjusting the world with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cHe comes Tuesdays and clacks his teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen: he says so. But I don\u2019t like the rat\u2019s grin. I will turn it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn the rats,\u201d she said before she could stop herself. The oddness made him laugh, a low sound that brought to mind the bruised blue of plums set out to dry on a sill. He was a man who laughed rarely, or at least a man who laughed in places where it echoed quietly and no harm could be done by it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the book sister,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBooks grow best in dry air,\u201d he said. \u201cLike rosemary. I am trying to learn the habits of everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything has too many habits,\u201d Ulriche said. He looked at her a little longer than necessary, and she frowned at her own complicity in this; she was not a person who invited long looks; she was meant to be a dark door that swung outward when called upon and closed again neatly, not creaking, not stuck. But not everything she was meant to be was what she was.\n\nAfter Prime she went to the library, which was both older and younger than her, older because of the fat-ankled volumes that had and continued to believe they had saved more than one life, younger because the stacks were new and smelled like pine would smell if pine were patient. She touched the covers as one might touch a railing. It steadied her. She took a small notebook out of her sleeve and turned to the middle, where weeks ago she had written:\n\nElias Hart has a jaw like the edge of a pew. Do not write this. Do not think this. Do not write that you should not think this.\n\nShe laughed at herself and then crossed it out lightly, so that if she needed to read it again she could. There were layers of ink in all the margins, like a palimpsest written by a child learning to lie.\n\nSister Maribeth drifted in and sat down without comment at the far table. She was needle-limbed, might have been moth-born. She always had lint in her hair. \u201cWhat did Agnes say?\u201d she asked, not looking up from the pile of catalog cards she had appointed herself to overlap like shingles.\n\n\u201cWhich Agnes?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly the one,\u201d Maribeth said. \u201cThere\u2019s only the one Agnes on mornings. Evenings it\u2019s different.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me not to feed the squirrels,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a sin to be so strict.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe puts out a bowl,\u201d Maribeth murmured. \u201cElias. A bowl of water. For small mouths.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does?\u201d The thought of his hands at the base of a bowl, setting it down with the attentive caution reserved for breakable things, made something in Ulriche go light, a loosening as of something long screwed in being gently backed out. \u201cDid you talk to him?\u201d\n\nMaribeth shook her head. \u201cNo. I listen. He whistles but only when he doesn\u2019t notice it; that\u2019s how he startsle-startles himself. There is a way men whistle when they are trying not to speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are always hearing things,\u201d Ulriche said.\n\n\u201cYou can hear them too,\u201d Maribeth said, and before Ulriche could ask whether she meant whistling or something else entirely, the bell for Terce blew another piece of morning into her hands. She wrapped it around herself and went to the chapel.\n\nIn the chapel there were twelve candles and a thirteenth left unlit for the thing no one could name in public. The floor was slate and sucked the warmth out of her knees as she knelt. The prayers slid over the teeth of the hours the way thread sometimes catches and then pulls tight and flush, a seam flat enough to forget. Next to her, Sister Verna\u2019s voice climbed and then fell as if the words were a hill made just for the soles of her.\n\n\u201cUlriche,\u201d said Father Oliver afterward, catching her shoulder near the sacristy. His hand was dry. He had smoothed his hair with something that made it lie down like obedient grass. \u201cYou were humming in the fourth antiphon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI apologize,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cI thought it was only inside.\u201d She had been humming; she knew it; she had heard the hum travel around her mouth and settle in the back of her teeth. It had been a low, sap-green sound that reminded her of everything that grew without asking permission.\n\n\u201cIt is no sin to hum,\u201d Father Oliver said, then added, his voice gentling in a way that made her wish she could like him: \u201cWhat is caught in you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing. A burr,\u201d she said. \u201cI will take it off on the porch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gardener,\u201d he said, low.\n\n\u201cThe rosemary,\u201d she corrected.\n\n\u201cYou can name it whatever makes it bearable for your head.\u201d He looked at her, and for a heart\u2019s beat his pupils widened and then tightened again, a change any bird might have thought meant predator and flight. \u201cBe careful, Ulriche.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am careful,\u201d she said, softly furious with a person who was either himself or a shape made to be stern so she would have a wall to push against. \u201cWe only have this life to be careful in. I do it as if it mattered.\u201d\n\nHe smiled too sadly for the moment and let her go. On her way out she touched the stone basin filled with water and saw, out of the corner of her eye, a face that was and wasn\u2019t hers squinting back. The water jittered; she was too warm; her skin was doing the weather\u2019s work.\n\nAfternoons in autumn were the library\u2019s best months. The boys from the parish school came in to return the novels they had pretended to read and to ask her for more like those, with swords and storms and improbable ghosts. There was a girl with hair exactly the color of walnut skins, Mara, who tugged at Ulriche\u2019s sleeve to ask for poetry about horses that didn\u2019t die on the last page. \u201cThey always die. I think poets hate horses,\u201d Mara said solemnly. \u201cBut I like the words how they get tossed like oats.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake this,\u201d Ulriche said, and gave her something without horses at all, because that was the trick you learned with children. Mara smiled and made the book disappear under her sweater the same way the squirrels did with nuts, with a yank and a twitch.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give her Dickinson,\u201d Sister Agnes whispered behind her ear, and then a passage of silence grazed her neck, and Ulriche again was alone with the sudden heaviness of her own body. It didn\u2019t matter what anyone said about ghosts. A convent made them whether or not there was anyone dead nearby to have been them first.\n\nElias came with the rosemary before Vespers. He was soaked to the knees from pounding the hose, the grass blistered his shins in a green rash, and he had dirt in both eyebrows as if he had been thinking too close to the ground. \u201cEnough?\u201d he asked, holding out a bundle tied with blue string, absurdly pretty for something rough that wanted to be crushed.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d she said. Their fingers brushed when she took it. It was not the first time a man\u2019s hand had touched her hand; that would have been theatrical, a pious lie. But it was the first time in years that the hand felt like a sentence she wanted to finish, not a period pressed in with a blunt pen.\n\nHe cleared his throat. \u201cThe prioress said to carry it to the kitchen, but I\u2019m likely to go lost in those halls.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is always sending you places you haven\u2019t walked,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cCome with me then.\u201d It was too forward, she knew, but an extra step had already been taken in the garden this morning when the air made a corridor that ended here.\n\nThey went through the hall of saints a mason had tried to carve in a hurry. The faces were too similar, all with mild mouths as though they had been told a joke they would understand after they died. \u201cThey watch,\u201d Elias said, sympathetic to their bland endurance.\n\n\u201cThey would look different if he\u2019d had more time,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cAs if time is the only ingredient in making someone less like their neighbor.\u201d She wished to unsay it; she was too sharp sometimes, and the blade shone where everyone could see. But Elias nodded, as if he had known many men who had had too little time and therefore too many similar faces.\n\nIn the kitchen, the smell of carrot tops and iron and hot dishwater met them like a family. Sister Bettina took the rosemary without thanks from Ulriche and with a blurted \u201cBless you\u201d to Elias. That ranked him, in this room, somewhere between a useful saint and a well-worn spoon. She used the rosemary with a stern hand on the stew. \u201cOnly a little,\u201d Ulriche said, but Bettina did not always hear advice, even when it wore black and carried a key.\n\nOn the walk back, in the long narrow hall with the crucifix that had one bent nail, Elias slowed as if going downhill, as if at the bottom of the hall there might be a pool of cold and he didn\u2019t wish to be the first into it. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to step wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother would say a man walks into a prayer and tramps the corners down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t tramped anything,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cYou\u2019re careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a mason,\u201d he confessed, rubbing a thumb over his fingers like smoothing grit. \u201cThen my wrist. It\u2019s different work to grow things. I thought: give me something that needs me to be soft.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can be soft,\u201d she said. There was a wildness to saying that in this hall, a small stupidity, like taking off one\u2019s shoes on the shoulder of a road because the gravel music is sweet. But he didn\u2019t flinch. He let the words sit between them like a bowl of water set out for something shy.\n\n\u201cSister Verna thinks I talk too much to the sparrows,\u201d he added, with a quick sideways smile that pulled pleasantly at a place near his mouth people likely stared at when they found excuses to.\n\n\u201cSister Verna thinks talking is a sin if it isn\u2019t Latin,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cYou may talk to the sparrows.\u201d\n\nA light flickered; one of the bulbs had been failing all week, moving in and out of its reason like a child on a swing leaning backward too far. Ulriche reached up with the hem of her sleeve and twisted it in, giving the glow a stern, motherly look. It steadied.\n\n\u201cYou know how to make the light obey,\u201d Elias said.\n\n\u201cI know how to threaten things into cooperation,\u201d she replied, and then they were in the courtyard again, carrying on their tongues the taste of something unblessed.\n\nAfter he had gone she sat under the pear tree and wrote in her small notebook on a page she had told herself belonged to Jude. The page didn\u2019t mind being borrowed. She wrote: He carries rosemary like a candle, sidewise so the drip won\u2019t land on his hand. She wiped that out, too; the binding shivered; the notebook might have been laughing.\n\nNight made the garden into a question. The squirrels turned into the idea of squirrels. The bowl Elias had set out earlier caught a coal of sky and held it until the moon cracked it in half. Ulriche slipped from her bed to watch. The boards were honest about her weight. \u201cGo back,\u201d said Sister Agnes from somewhere behind the wardrobe.\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Ulriche said, \u201cas soon as I see the color change.\u201d She waited. It changed. She went back.\n\nIn November the mornings were wet as if someone had moistened the world with breath. She took her breakfast early and alone because Bettina believed hurry was a kind of prudence and served porridge before anyone wanted it. Ulriche\u2019s spoon made a sound like small thunder on the rim of her bowl. \u201cHave you decided yet,\u201d Sister Verna asked, appearing with her saucer of honey like a lady from a days-old painting, \u201cif you want the winter in the library to be lavender?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was lavender last winter,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cThe year before was cinnamon. Do you remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cLavender,\u201d Verna insisted without hearing, and nodded to herself as if given good counsel.\n\n\u201cRosemary,\u201d came a voice from the door; it was Sister Maribeth, showing a sprig like a banner. \u201cIt\u2019s good for thinking. For memory. For\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFor meat,\u201d Bettina said, ladling the porridge as if it might escape.\n\n\u201cRosemary, rosemary,\u201d Verna sang, and Bettina told her to stop it with an iron glance. \u201cYou\u2019ll make me forget what I forget purposefully,\u201d she said to Maribeth, and Maribeth tucked the sprig behind her ear prudently, as though it were a pencil she might need for sums.\n\nSo the herb spiraled around Ulriche\u2019s days. That week one of the children set an essay in her hands: The Uses and Abuses of Herbs by Mara Jane Kelleher, age nine. At the bottom she had drawn a rabbit that looked like an onion. \u201cDo I get a notion?\u201d Mara asked. She meant a sticker. Ulriche gave her one shaped like a star, which stuck itself crooked on Mara\u2019s cuff.\n\nElias\u2019s whistle rose and fell beyond the windows. She could pick out the moments he forgot to hold it and it slipped away. She stood at the stack of missals and pretended to count them to have reason to remain near the glass. Outside he stooped to talk to an absent cat. He said the things men say to animals they miss and think might come if praised in the right tone. The bowl for the squirrels sat near the rosemary bed and shivered when sparrows landed on its lip like gossiping women on a pew.\n\n\u201cDo something with your hands,\u201d Sister Agnes hissed in her ear. Ulriche picked up a book and put it down. She picked up her rosary. She dropped it. It made a falling sound that belonged in another world, the sound of beads hitting floor that people often remember in the last second before they give up something they cannot stop holding.\n\nIn confession she said: \u201cI covet a man\u2019s wrist, Father.\u201d\n\nFather Oliver said: \u201cHand. It\u2019s hand. Wrist is too specific.\u201d\n\n\u201cI covet his wrist,\u201d she repeated stubbornly, and the silence on the other side of the grate changed quality, acquired a texture that she recognized as the shape a man makes when he understands he has walked as far as he can on someone else\u2019s sentence. \u201cHe is kind,\u201d she said. \u201cThings grow because he means them to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are kinds of growth we do not invite,\u201d Father Oliver said, and then coughed, and Ulriche, who had once had a physician father who kept a little box of remedies in his study that smelled like mint and ground glass, worried stupidly for several days about Father Oliver\u2019s lungs.\n\n\u201cYou see foxes,\u201d Maribeth whispered the next morning, tugging at Ulriche\u2019s sleeve. \u201cIn the far lot. In daylight. Can you believe?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no foxes near the school,\u201d Sister Verna said, confident, and then blinked and said, \u201cDid you want me?\u201d to no one, and went back to whispering to her honey in case it had suggestions.\n\nUlriche went to the far lot during her hour of recreation and saw only a smudge of orange paint on a fence that someone had splashed there in the spring. It glowed pleasantly against the wood as if there had been a fire. On her way back she saw Elias with a pad of paper in his hands, scribbling, and she felt her heart wobble in her chest at the thought that someone who made things grow also made notes.\n\n\u201cWhat do you write?\u201d she asked, stopping short enough for the gravel to answer from beneath her shoes.\n\n\u201cNames,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s where. I keep forgetting if this is a black-eyed Susan that has gone to bed or something else that\u2019ll surprise me with a leaf shaped like a fish. And women\u2019s requests\u2014 they don\u2019t go where a man keeps them if he doesn\u2019t write them down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou keep our requests.\u201d She was too pleased. She knew it. It shone off her like sweat.\n\n\u201cI like instructions,\u201d he said simply.\n\n\u201cYou were a mason,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone once told you to make a wall fall into its mortar as if it were born there.\u201d\n\nHe smiled at the image with the sort of quiet abandon a man has when he recognizes his own thinking but wearing an unfamiliar hat. He tapped his pencil against his wrist twice. \u201cI want to do no harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll be lonely,\u201d she said, soft. He looked at her as if surprised she was that kind of woman, the one who would say such a sentence and not look down to see whether she\u2019d stepped in it.\n\n\u201cNot always,\u201d he said finally. \u201cIt depends on who you stand beside and whether they go blunt or bright when something breaks.\u201d\n\nThere was a squirrel near the ash that had learned to stand on its hind legs and beg without shame. Elias laughed and gave it sunflower seeds. It curled its hands around his finger the way a child does with a mother\u2019s hairpins. Ulriche could not help it. The laughter braided itself to the sight and made a rope that tied something in her.\n\nThat evening, at Compline, her voice wobbled and the line she was meant to sing turned out to have a bend in it that her throat had to step around. \u201cDo you have a fever?\u201d Sister Bettina demanded, putting her rough hand on Ulriche\u2019s forehead with the good authority of someone who had been told, long ago, that this was comfort.\n\n\u201cI am just not in tune,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cMy string is winter-dry.\u201d\n\nIn her cell she lay awake listening to the slow, distant buckling of the old pipes and the near, familiar noise her mind made in the middle of the night, a sort of thrumm. She thought of Elias\u2019s pencil and the small groove a man\u2019s skin holds after a thing is taken away from it. She decided in a whisper spoken to no one that she would ask to help in the garden, just an hour, as a test of obedience in the other direction. God owns the rosemary. God owns my ridiculous wrist.\n\nWhen she asked the prioress at breakfast, Mother Heloise bent a little so their faces were closer than they usually were allowed to be and said, with a kindness that grated because it seemed reluctant, as though it had been pulled out of her throat by a hook, \u201cYou are very useful where you are. Do not set yourself out like a bowl on a sill and wait for what comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll work in the library,\u201d Ulriche said, and then, because she had carried the request into the room and was not yet brave enough to drop it, added, almost in the same breath: \u201cBut the garden is short of hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Flint will come more often.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no\u2014\u201d\n\nMother Heloise tapped the table lightly, a sign not to contradict but to accept that the world is composite and some boards, when leaned on, squeak. \u201cI will ask Sister Verna to see to the rosemary. That will be full of morals for her.\u201d\n\nUlriche swallowed. The porridge had gone gluey; it stuck on the way down and then moved with a jerk that made her close her eyes. When she opened them Maribeth was looking at her with a face that had remembered something too late.\n\n\u201cYou can read to me in the afternoons,\u201d Father Oliver said later, finding her behind a stack of pamphlets that announced a fair that had already happened. He was holding his cough in like a parcel at the post office. \u201cOur minds like to be outside in winter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are convenient,\u201d Ulriche said, and at once hated the acid in her voice. But Father Oliver either did not hear it or was accustomed to the flavor.\n\n\u201cPerhaps you could read something about gardening,\u201d he said blandly, and she stared at his sideburn to punish herself by having to look somewhere silly. He patted the top of a chair, and she stood because if she sat her bones would become the chair\u2019s and she was not yet willing to be furniture.\n\nShe did not go to the garden that day, nor the next. On Thursday Elias came and stood at the library door with his cap in his hands like a man about to ask for a child\u2019s release. \u201cSister,\u201d he said softly, and the syllables took their time, each one in a bowl of its own.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, seeing, at his shoulder, the ghost of a leaf pressed very flat between two pages somewhere.\n\n\u201cI caught my sleeve,\u201d he said, showing her a rip, barely an inch, that had caught on the rose canes by the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s a spot on a thorn that hooks like it was hammered to snare. I thought you might know how to keep this from unraveling itself to the elbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want mending,\u201d Ulriche said, relief rising in her like steam because she could do this without being suspected of wanting it. \u201cBring it here.\u201d She took his sleeve in both hands; he had slipped his arm out of the coat and stood in his thin shirt, gooseflesh rising politely on his skin. The tear was small but strategic, near the seam, sly. She threaded her needle, which lived in a book, as all the best tools do, and licked the end of the thread. He looked away with a delicacy that made her want to look more closely.\n\n\u201cMy mother would have said to spit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYour mother would have been correct,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cSpit makes everything obedient that otherwise prefers to talk back.\u201d\n\nHe made a huffing sound that wanted to be a laugh and wasn\u2019t certain whether he ought to be born. She put the coat over her knees and stitched with care that bordered on prayer. Small, neat, like writing on rice. \u201cThere,\u201d she said. \u201cPut your arm back in and don\u2019t be proud. Lift the other sleeve into the thorn if you must, but not this one.\u201d It was a small joke, and it made him smile, and for a moment she allowed herself to believe that moments were allowed to be their own size and did not have to grow up into days that carried visible consequences with all the gravity of a name carved in stone.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, and then, quickly, because he seemed to be learning the practice of saying what he was thinking before prudence plucked it back: \u201cYou look tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cI read to Father Oliver,\u201d she said, as though reading were labor unmighty as dragging a ship up a beach. \u201cThe Romans invented every possible terrible way to make a road.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Romans had an answer to everything except kindness,\u201d Elias murmured.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s harsh. Cicero loved his daughter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot enough to make a difference on the road,\u201d he said, and lifted his repaired arm and flexed it once, twice, as if he were testing a hinge. \u201cIt\u2019s strong,\u201d he said, and looked at her, and looked away, and the room grew a little wider around them, as if someone had opened a window.\n\nThat night frost came, and the rosemary took it personally. Elias wrapped the beds in burlap like parcels he meant to ship to some generous god with a more temperate porch. Ulriche watched from the shadow of the cloister and whispered a psalm whose words held in their thin hands what she could not carry herself.\n\nThe first snow fell like paper mistakes\u2014 small, light, erasing nothing but suggesting a new draft. Ulriche stood again under the arch and let three flakes land on the back of her hand and vanish and thought, suddenly wild with it, that if someone were to touch her just then she would leave a mark in the shape of a ghost.\n\n\u201cSister,\u201d Elias said, near enough for her to smell carrot greens on his cuffs. He was quiet. \u201cI ran over a squirrel on the road last night.\u201d\n\nHer breath jerked in; it was not an event and yet it was. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Washington by the park. It darted. I was not\u2014 I mean, I had not expected\u2014 I\u2019ve driven that road a hundred times and there\u2019s no good way to\u2014 it comes before you\u2019re done with the first thought and after the second, and then there it is also after the last\u2014\u201d He stopped. He looked ill.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d she said. She meant it in the old, wide sense, I grieve near you.\n\n\u201cI heard it,\u201d he said. He put a hand knuckles-first to his mouth so he would not have to describe the sound and also as if he might be able to push the sound back in, make his mouth a hole for burying it. \u201cI stopped, and there was nothing to fix. Its little feet.\u201d He swallowed with care. He looked at her with a heat that could have belonged to anger at her for standing in a place where he could see her. He deserved to be reticent now, to be alone if that was required. \u201cI didn\u2019t know all the parts of me it would break.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are allowed to mourn anything you touch,\u201d she said, and her voice came out too thin and too wise; the combination was intolerable. He flinched, a small movement that wanted to be a run but couldn\u2019t in this space and in this habit. \u201cElias,\u201d she said, daring his name in their small morning, \u201cyou are not\u2014 you do not\u2014 it is not a sin to be broken in a place that didn\u2019t ask permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not what?\u201d he asked. There was anger there, to her shock, like an iron making up its mind to be hot.\n\n\u201cYou are not wrong,\u201d she said, and cursed herself for sounding like a schoolbook. \u201cYou are not wrong. You are not wrong.\u201d Saying it thrice made it harsher, like soap suds piling up where someone has scrubbed too long.\n\nHe breathed out, an old air that had been sitting in him for hours. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d she said, and then realized she didn\u2019t know where that sentence ended. Into God, into the warm, into the place with tea in a chipped cup, into the portion of her that was a room with its chair already in it.\n\nHe did not come in. He stood on the path and held his arms against himself as if to keep in all the heat he felt he hadn\u2019t earned. \u201cI\u2019m ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cMen are ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople do not move the same speed,\u201d she said, and it was poor comfort and also the only true thing she had in her satchel. \u201cIf something small catches in a wheel, it doesn\u2019t matter to the wheel what the size was.\u201d\n\nHe nodded then, so slightly she might have imagined it, and turned away, stepping as if the ground might be thin in places. He went toward the gate and through it, and she went toward Morning Office, and the bell braided the difference between them into something official.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at him,\u201d Sister Agnes warned, and then, gently, like someone who has found a large animal on a porch and wants to back away without startling it: \u201cYou are holding yourself too tight. Your voice will break like icicles.\u201d\n\nShe kept her eyes on the book, on the good black print that never varied from page to page like a hand you could trust on your back. She sang and her throat responded with the obedience she paid it to, and it sounded like a dozen other mornings, and no one saw that her breath carried over and thinned where another woman\u2019s would have deepened, no one but herself, who lived there always and therefore could not pretend ignorance.\n\nThere was a squirrel on the rain barrel again that afternoon. She stood at the window and saw it lifting a single piece of bread under its chin the way a child hides a secret in their T-shirt. She thought of the wheel. She thought of Father Oliver\u2019s cough. She thought of the rosemary\u2014 the way its leaves were little green nails\u2014 and how the frost had made it taste sharper, almost like a reprimand.\n\nMara came in and asked for more poems. \u201cNot about horses,\u201d she said quickly, catching herself. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Ulriche said, and gave her a book with a train on the cover. \u201cThese have wheels; it will be all right.\u201d\n\nMara nodded solemnly. \u201cMy mother says I shouldn\u2019t get attached to things that can go away. But if you don\u2019t get attached then the world turns into a coat and you never put your hands in the pockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are cold pockets,\u201d Ulriche said.\n\n\u201cJust some,\u201d Mara agreed. \u201cBut then you put a warm rock in.\u201d\n\nWhen the library was empty she sat down with her own notebook and wrote: He will not come to the garden. He will not whistle. There is a bowl and yet nothing cups water with its hands. She looked at the sentence and scowled; she was too elaborate; she was a woman in love with a metaphor because she was not yet permitted to be in love with the man whom the metaphor had been meant to make safe.\n\nThat night in the refectory she ate pears cut too early and therefore punishing. Sister Verna argued with the salt cellar. Sister Bettina told a story about geese, her hands flapping politely at the interesting parts. Father Oliver did not sit with them; his cough had learned their timings and now came when laughter embarrassed them. Mother Heloise touched Ulriche\u2019s sleeve once and said, softly, \u201cBeware your invention,\u201d and Ulriche did not know if she meant the stories she told herself or the new way she had of making the world obey her when it ought not.\n\nIn her cell before the candle she took the rosary and held it to her mouth without quite saying the prayers. The beads smelled faintly of smoke, of skin that had known a long winter and made peace with it. She was both the person with the prayer and the person it fell around, and there were others in the room\u2014 Agnes and Verna and Maribeth and Heloise and Oliver and Flint who didn\u2019t exist and yet sometimes clacked his teeth in the corridor and said: it needs mortar here, girl, more mortar\u2014 and she thought, with the cool clarity of a woman counting last coins: I am talking to myself. She did not name the fact again; she dropped it into the water of the bowl on the sill of her mind and the moon cut it in half and left it there, two silvers she might spend later or never.\n\nIn the morning Elias did not come to the garden. In the afternoon he came and stood at a distance and looked at the rosemary with a grief that had the odd, clean edges of a new plate. He tied burlap to the bedposts as if mummifying a queen. He did not look at the bowl. He emptied it. He turned the water out onto the gravel, which sucked it down with a thirst that felt inappropriate to her, greedy. The bowl lay on its side, an ear listening to the ground for footsteps.\n\nUlriche went down with a broom and swept the path for no reason at all. \u201cIt is cold,\u201d she said, because the air had to be told what it was in case it had forgotten and needed reminding to remain consistent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying not to drive,\u201d he said without preamble, not even looking at her. \u201cI took my bicycle into town and then I found a reason not to go at all. Is there a way not to go at all? I thought I could stay in the small places and nothing fast would cross there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe small places turn into roads if you stand in them too long.\u201d\n\nHe shut his eyes briefly, like someone bracing for cold water. \u201cIt was a squirrel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters the way anything matters that had a face,\u201d she said, and he winced as if she\u2019d said something indecent. They were both so tired of their own gentleness.\n\n\u201cSister,\u201d he said, and swallowed. \u201cUlriche.\u201d Her name came out like an ash in his mouth that he did not want to spit out in case it shocked the adjacent hearth. \u201cI keep thinking I can make the world safe if I move slow enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a good thought for a gardener, a bad one for a man in a car,\u201d she said, and he laughed once, a bitter bark at his own mistake, and looked at the empty bowl as if it had betrayed him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t put water out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just reminds them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t become desert to control the animals we love,\u201d she said, and he flinched again at the word love, even though it belonged to squirrels.\n\n\u201cI have to\u2014\u201d he began, and did not finish. Everything inside him had turned to slope. He couldn\u2019t stand on any of it.\n\nAfter he left, a robin went into the empty bowl to see if it had misplaced the idea of water. Ulriche lifted it and filled it halfway and set it back. It reflected only a thin line of sky. She watched it and felt, in her throat, the stupid bravery of a song.\n\nAt night she dreamed she was driving, though she had never learned and would never. The road was a long, level ribbon of unspooling cloth, and the trees leaned in like gossips. In the road there were buttons and coins and a single spoon. She couldn\u2019t avoid all of them. She felt each small thing fuss under the wheels and then be a nothing behind. When she woke her hands hurt from gripping the sheet and the candle had burned down to a small sugar of wax that smelled like his sleeve.\n\nIn the days that followed Elias did not touch the rosemary. He went around it as if it were an open grave. He tended the winter cabbage with the close attention of a nurse to a child who refuses broth. He wrote fewer names. He came to the library once and stood a generous distance from the door and said, \u201cDo you have a book that doesn\u2019t know what it is about?\u201d and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s all of them,\u201d and he said, \u201cI mean something that won\u2019t tell me something I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d and she picked through the dumb animals of prose and found an almanac that predicted only weather that had already happened.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, not looking at her, but looking at his hands as if somewhere between his fingers a map would begin to appear that would save him.\n\n\u201cElias,\u201d she said, and then, because there was no one else in the room but the two of them and all the women in her she had carried in to be witnesses and to keep her honest, \u201cI want you to be all right.\u201d\n\nHe nodded once, slow, and said, without looking up, \u201cYou make sentences that look like bridges,\u201d and then turned and walked through a door that had not been open a moment before.\n\nWhen the snow was finally real, not paper but wet and insisting, Sister Bettina\u2019s stew tasted like a home that had thought of other people first. Father Oliver\u2019s cough settled into his chest with the heaviness of a dog inside for the winter. Mother Heloise asked Ulriche to inventory the schoolbooks. Sister Verna arranged the honey in the cupboard by light and lighter and lightest. Sister Agnes never entered a room she did not leave at once if Ulriche was already there.\n\nIt was a good season to be quiet and yet she was loud with care. She kept seeing the squirrel\u2019s little hand on Elias\u2019s finger taking seed. She kept seeing the moment the bowl turned over and became a listening thing. She kept seeing, in her mind, a road that she had never driven and a movement she had never made except in dream.\n\nAt Vespers she sang and her voice did not break. At Compline her hands were steady. In the night she woke and put her feet on the floor and said the names of all the saints the mason had made alike and wished for each one of them a different face. In the morning she told the squirrel on the rain barrel that there would be water again in the bowl today, that the gardener had not meant the world to be dry forever, that sometimes people needed to stop in order to be able to start without burning the engine out of themselves.\n\nThe squirrel\u2019s ears twitched. It had its own business. Ulriche laughed. The bell rang and the sound was exactly the same and completely different, and she gathered her basket and her breath and went out into the courtyard toward the rosemary that had argued with frost and won, barely, and felt the old, unwieldy feeling blooming again under the habits she wore, the detested and loved abundance. She stepped carefully, not because she was fragile, but because the ground itself seemed to have learned to test her, to tilt just slightly at the edges. She would have to learn to keep her weight in the middle.\n\nThe day took up its instruments and began, and somewhere beyond the wall a car went by with a low, anesthetized sound like a prayer said by someone not sure whether they meant it. She pulled the thread in her sleeve tight, the one that held today to yesterday, and tried not to watch which way it went when the knot did its work.Advent made the light softer, as if the day had wrapped itself in gauze and could only be handled with clean fingers. Someone had tucked sprigs of cedar behind the statues\u2019 blank-eyed patience, and the cloister smelled like a good coat brought down from a high shelf. Ulriche caught herself saying \u201cO come,\u201d under her breath without the rest of it, and stopped, embarrassed, because it felt like calling someone out of a doorway and then not holding it for them. The rosemary had taken to exhaling at odd moments, its scent rising when no wind moved, as if it had decided on its own schedule of remembrance. The bowl on the gravel wore a petal of ice each morning now, thin as a fingernail; she lifted it with the tip of one finger, cracked it, and felt the small, treacherous pleasure of breaking something so perfectly round.\n\nFather Oliver\u2019s cough found the hollow places in the chapel and set up house there, tapping at the plaster as if asking politely for more room. Later, in his little office that smelled faintly of old ink and the toasted edges of maybe-mistakes, she read to him from a borrowed anthology of Roman speeches and then from the legends of saints, because he had asked for something with a spine made of vowels. \u201cLucy,\u201d he said, when she paused for his breath to catch up with him, \u201cis a good one for winter. Light on the head. Courage in her pockets.\u201d He made a motion with his hand as if setting candles in a circle on water. \u201cThe girls will want a procession. It steadies them to balance flame.\u201d\n\n\u201cFire and hair,\u201d Ulriche said, dubious. \u201cWe are fools for God and also for pageantry.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth are good for a body that doesn\u2019t know where to put its extra heat,\u201d he murmured, and coughed until his eyes watered and then smiled apologetically at the floor.\n\nPreparations took up space in the halls. Sister Bettina wrapped wire in circles and tucked rosemary and laurel and a stray branch of holly through them until they looked like crowns that had been left in a cupboard through three dynasties and still remembered whose heads they had touched. Sister Verna licked her thumb and rubbed at a spot on the wall where a child\u2019s hand had been briefly present, then went back to humming a tune from a century that had never happened. The girls tried on the idea of being lucifers with grave seriousness, mouths pursed, hands flat as they practiced the art of not tipping the small flames that would one day find them again in dream and ask to be balanced. Maribeth walked behind them and held her hands ready, as if she could catch falling light like a mother catches a cup that tips just past the point of saving.\n\nElias stayed mostly at the far end of the garden, where the cabbages made a bouquet of the close kind, green packed into green. He had rebuilt the compost bin from palleted wood and a patience that made the boards tell him where they wanted to be, and he turned the heap with a slow, mindful zeal that did not trouble the rats and therefore troubled him. Once, when Ulriche opened the library window to air the dust that hung heavy as though it had been taught to settle by an old woman, she heard him whistle once and then stop, mid-bird, as if the tune had remembered itself and fled. The bowl lay newly upright; water found its round again. The first day there were no visitors, and the second day a robin with a chest like a small argument tried it out and made the surface tremble around its idea of thirst.\n\nShe set aside a little time each afternoon to inventory the books she was pretending to inventory. She touched their spines and said the titles aloud, which is the kind of inventory words prefer. The heating pipes spoke in the ceiling, a private Morse of knocks and groans that meant something to the building and to no one else. One evening, when the cold came in like a man with a key and an authority to enter, the pipes stopped speaking and then protested in a startled clatter, then went quiet in a way that made her dislike the silence simply because it had been chosen without her. She went on counting, and when she reached the shelf of parish histories the ceiling made a sound like a decision.\n\nThe decision was water. It found an old path in the plaster and took it with the eager, innocent confidence of anything obeying an inclination set up long before it was born. It came dark first, then shining, then falling in a curtained rush that made her feel how much a book weighs when it has taken in what it cannot use. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, and the word was not at all useful but felt necessary as a person\u2019s hand extended on instinct toward a pot falling where it shouldn\u2019t. She ran and heard her own feet swear at the floor. \u201cBettina,\u201d she called, and \u201cMaribeth,\u201d and heard her voice hit the corners and bounce.\n\nThe library took on the soggy gravity of a harbor in a bad dream. Ulriche dragged a cart into the rain and began to build a lopsided ark. \u201cFlat first,\u201d she muttered, and lifted all the folios whose backs would give first under this, whose pages would make islands of mold if handled with anything less than love. Maribeth appeared with her sleeves rolled to the elbow, small and everywhere, catching the falling water with pans and a single, ancient washbowl that had belonged to a woman who had washed other things and would not begrudge books this use. Sister Verna whispered to the leaking plaster in Latin that had not been taught for this purpose. Sister Agnes lifted her veil and tied it up in a knot at the nape of her neck as if going into a kitchen fight and began to lay sheets of brown paper between sodden pages with the efficiency of someone who has always known how to triage the too-wet.\n\nElias came as if the building had sent for him. His boots tracked in a lawful measure of snow; his hair was full of it, like the head of a saint in a fresco that had been painted badly and in love with white. He saw the arc of water and the lists of books and did not ask permission; he reached for the heaviest things and carried them like a man carrying sleeping children out of a room where someone had forgotten about the oven door. \u201cWhere?\u201d he said, and let her point him without questions toward the long tables in the cloister where the wind would keep the damp from settling in with its coat and luggage. He went back and forth as if a narrow river had been cut through him and he could step it without speech.\n\n\u201cUpright,\u201d Ulriche said to anyone who would listen, and not everyone did. \u201cGently. Fan them like a bird opening. Paper, paper, paper. No heat. Never heat.\u201d She heard herself and was briefly ashamed of the command in her mouth, which felt like the taste of a word she had avoided and now found too easy, then forgave herself because breath had to go somewhere. Sister Bettina brought every towel that had ever dried a nun and a dish, including the ones that smelled faintly of old onion, and made neat stacks that relieved Ulriche\u2019s heart just for their orderly existence. Sister Heloise arrived with her shoulders squared into what she believed was the shape of a threshold and set four of the schoolboys to the noble business of holding books open gently with clean, dry hands. \u201cDon\u2019t break the backs,\u201d Ulriche said to them, and they blushed all at once and then understood that she meant the visible spines and not their own.\n\n\u201cBrother Flint says a split happens where no one intends,\u201d Elias said without looking up, and Ulriche nodded sharply because she could hear the clack of phantom teeth in the far hall and did not have her hands free to cross herself against it. He stood in water to his ankles and seemed not to care about the soaking. He set heavy, swollen volumes down with a courtesy that would have made a mother\u2019s eyes warm. When he slipped once, the floor behaving like a separate person with poor loyalties, Ulriche turned without thinking and put her hand to his wrist. It was cold and damp and had the frail bravado of something that has broken once and tries to remember how not to. She held him, not long and not lightly, and then let go, and he righted and kept working, and his ears reddened as if each had taken upon itself to carry a discrete portion of his certainty.\n\nMaribeth ran out into the biting rightness of the air with her arms full and then back in. \u201cI will lose a toe,\u201d she said to no one, and went out again. Father Oliver had been fetched or had sent himself, and now he stood useless and gasping in the doorway and then, with effort that cost him a minute of breath, went away and came back with two old window screens that he had suddenly remembered under his bed. Elias looked at them and smiled with the quick, narrow happiness of a man seeing a tool arrive when he had already made a space for it in his mind. He balanced books on them to let the air climb through. \u201cTomorrow I can make more,\u201d he said without moving his mouth much, and Ulriche, who had no right, wanted to put her hand in the space between his shoulder blades and feel the place where that promise had started.\n\nThe books lay on the tables under the cloister and breathed like animals not yet persuaded to stay. The wind was good but had the wrong kind of faith; it would dry anything but could not be told where to stop. Ulriche walked the line of pages like a nurse with a lantern. She slid paper between leaves and said little things to them, only the kinds of sentences that books remember. The girls with candles in their futures stood at the edges and held their hands very still, as if practicing carrying flame and moisture, weight and nothing. Sister Agnes sawed through her sarcasm and made neat piles of damp paper that would be useful again if treated right. Sister Heloise assigned clumsy tasks to herself and carried them out with a thoroughness that made her ankles wobble at the end of each trip. Father Oliver sat down when he shouldn\u2019t have and put his head in his hands and then laughed once, gently, at his own weakness.\n\nBy the time the men came with wrenches as long as arms and shut the water\u2019s idea off, the library had been rewritten in the air. Ulriche stood under the stain in the ceiling and felt the presence of time as a thing that could ruin and preserve with equal talent. Elias came to stand near, aware enough to stay at the distance at which a person\u2019s breath is their own again. His hair had dried into points that made him look slightly electrified. His hands were mottled red where the cold had kept its teeth too long.\n\n\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d she said, and it was a lie told with a responsible heart, because some of the books had already swelled past recognition and would be reduced to pulp and then to memory, and anyway she wasn\u2019t speaking only of books because a person\u2019s throat cannot be ordered to select its objects. Elias nodded, and the shape of the nod was not yes but I believe you want it.\n\nThat night, when the procession went down the middle of the chapel, the lights had been cut at the fuse-box as a caution against wiring that had taken the water personally and was considering a bad marriage with it. The girls\u2019 crowns held four candles each, and the room was transformed into a lake with small boats that knew how to row themselves, slow, orphanly brave. Rosemary had found its way into some of the wreaths, sharp green among the benevolent laurel, and the heat coaxed its oil up in a smell that made the inside of Ulriche\u2019s mouth taste like someone saying her name in a winter house. She was not crowned; that belonged to a child whose passion for a straight spine could be seen from the back pew. Ulriche carried a taper and held it as if it were a pen that might drip fire if she was careless, which all pens do if attended badly.\n\nThe hymn made the chapel lean in. Ulriche sang and felt her own voice walk carefully now, not for fear of slipping but because it pleased her to place her foot right. When the girls tilted to make the bend, the song shifted and the air moved and a few drops of molten wax fell onto the black cloth of someone\u2019s shoulder and left pale coins there, which would be picked off later with the satisfying ritual of fingernails knowing their business. Elias had come to the far back and stood like a volunteer fireman called to witness rather than to work. When the smallest girl\u2019s candle guttered, he did nothing, because sometimes what is required is not answering the flame\u2019s question until it asks a second time, and by then the girl had found her breath and given it carefully. Ulriche\u2019s eye snagged on Elias\u2019s outline and then let go, and she sang the last verse with the feeling that sometimes light prefers to live in a man instead of on his head.\n\nAfter the candles had made their little smoke and the room smelled briefly of clean tunnels, the girls took off their crowns and rubbed their scalps as if they had been holding a thought too long. Outside, a skiff of snow had had opinions about the world and made everything tidier. Ulriche stepped into the cold the way one steps into a question and felt the bite on her teeth. Elias was waiting near the low wall where a drunk had once slept for three months and then gone away without saying goodbye to the stone. He had something small in his hand that shone dully in the light from the sacristy.\n\n\u201cYou dropped this,\u201d he said, and held out her thimble. It was the brass one with the dent like a moon where once a stubborn needle had taught her about pressure and luck. \u201cBy the screens,\u201d he added, as if he had to locate it in the day for her to be permitted to touch it again. She took it, and their fingers did not meet, because he knew too, now, how not to turn every kindness into a confession.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and the thank you meant more than the thimble and less than the whole of the future, which is a kind of politeness. They stood and let their breath be mistaken for speech. He looked toward the far lot beyond the wall, where the snow lit itself. \u201cI saw a fox,\u201d he said quietly, and his voice had that cautious postscript tone people have when they are mentioning a thing the morning will forget. \u201cIt was looking at me as if I had brought it here by saying fox aloud.\u201d\n\nMaribeth appeared long enough to say, \u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d and vanish, which is how she preferred to authenticate miracles without spoiling them.\n\nThe next day the library wore its guts on the outside in a way that would have embarrassed a prideful building. Books stood in long lines with their mouths open. The small boys came in on tiptoe and stared as if at a wounded soldier whose story they suspected was noble and bad. Mara touched a spine with the kind of care reserved for sleeping cats and asked if the poems would be harmed. \u201cPoems don\u2019t mold easily,\u201d Ulriche said, and did not mind that the statement could not bear examination. Mara brought her breath and tried to use it like a fan, polite about the pieces of herself she offered. \u201cI wrote about the flood,\u201d she said, and showed a paper with a title too grand for its size, The Water Comes But We Button Back, which made Ulriche laugh in the manner of a person who has needed a small absurdity and found it placed perfectly into her hand.\n\nElias came with frames he had made out of old screens and sticks that had once been part of something else and now were happier. He set them up quietly and handed them over as if returning a borrowed thing. \u201cI made the mesh loose,\u201d he said, and she nodded and did not say what she was thinking, which was that the sight of a useful thing made by the mind she had been watching was a frostflower in her. He grinned once, quickly, when one of the boys said, with reverence, \u201cIt\u2019s like a fort,\u201d and then put his grin away as if he had wrapped it in cloth and set it on a high shelf for later.\n\nMother Heloise, who was not unobservant when she allowed herself to be, caught Ulriche by the shoulder as she went by and said softly, in a tone that pretended to be about housekeeping, \u201cBe sure to leave the doors open a little so the air is never surprised.\u201d Ulriche murmured that she would. Heloise\u2019s fingers tightened and then let go, as if they had been told, by some older woman who once had young fingers, that letting go is its own order.\n\nThat night the pipes were fixed with a noise that came up through the floorboards like a man clearing his throat after a long sermon. The heat resumed its exhausted habits. Ulriche sat on the edge of her bed with her notebook in her lap and wrote without crossing anything out: The books breathe, and I go from one to another with a hand that knows only to open. If a page tears, it is because I forgot it would. If a life tears, perhaps it is also because I believed in the paper more than in the air. Agnes rustled in the wardrobe with the dry authority of someone who knows how to fold a sheet so that its corners meet. \u201cDon\u2019t be clever for the sake of being not-sad,\u201d she said, and Ulriche closed the notebook with something like obedience and blew out the candle with something like courage.\n\nWhen she woke in the deep, the snow had added itself, and the moon had chosen a square of garden to sit on. She went to the window and saw the bowl with a lid on, neat as a pie. She took her robe and went out into the pitiless and then became part of it by forgetting to hate it. Her breath made her veil move, and she laughed at herself because she still found that surprising. She touched the ice and broke it and said a small apology to no one. In the far lot, a line cut through the new snow where a fox had decided the shortest way between two pieces of itself was a straight one, and for a second the world seemed to her a place where the shapes of animals could be read the way the liturgy could be read, with the right voice and with hands steady enough to turn the page.\n\n\u201cGod owns the rosemary,\u201d she told the bowl, because the bowl, unlike God, benefited from being addressed directly. \u201cHe also owns the pipes and the way that water remembers its childhood in the hills. He owns my wrist. He owns everything I should put away.\u201d The bowl did not answer, which was proper. The bell began, low and then thinner and then low again, like a man unsure whether anyone was listening until he heard himself.\n\nShe kept her eyes down at Lauds and then raised them because a person who is always down becomes a person who reads only one kind of letter. Father Oliver\u2019s cough receded as men recede into better rooms. Maribeth wore lint like a crown. Sister Verna asked whether sugar remembered its cane when it was set in tea, and no one answered because she had not asked them in any language they knew. Sister Bettina trimmed the rosemary back as if a hard truth could be softened by being given a neat haircut and then tucked the cuttings into the kitchen with a sternness that liked to pretend itself to be generosity.\n\nThe fox\u2019s tracks were gone by midday, replaced by the scrawl of children and the sensible, resigned rectangles of adult feet. Elias spent an hour mending the fence where the snow had shown him how badly it wanted to lean in. He waved, once, in a way that told her he knew she had seen him and also knew they were holding themselves to a kind of hunger that had become, not virtue, but a woven habit one could recognize by its pattern even at a distance. She waved back, a small piece of cloth lifted to show consent to the weather.\n\nIn the afternoon she opened a book that had dried nicely and placed her hand on the first page as if greeting a living thing returned from a fever. The paper felt like a healed place. The words, blotted and dim in spots, seemed to her braver for having survived the water\u2019s insistence. She bent and breathed them in, and for a moment did not feel the strain of being watched by rules or the soft, incessant pressure of a kindness that the world had not decided where to put. She felt only that there are some pages a person arrives at by accident and others a person chooses and that, in both cases, the turning is the point and not the destination. She touched the knot of thread at her sleeve and tugged it once, to reassure herself that it knew its business, and then she went to see whether the bowl had kept its thin lid off for the sparrows, because there are some duties a woman keeps because they allow her to remain exactly herself in the face of the day.Snow learned the habits of the convent faster than some of the girls did. It slid off the slate like a sister\u2019s veil when she gave herself permission to run between errands, then clung in small petulant ridges on the north sides of stones where no sun ever bothered to argue. The library wore its convalescence without complaining; books lined the tables and pews like patients who pretended not to notice one another\u2019s bandages, and Ulriche moved among them with the quiet of a nurse taught by winters that the body prefers the sound of a soft hand over any heroics. \u201cAir,\u201d she told the pages, and tucked slips of paper where damp insisted it could make a home, the way a woman tucks necessary truths into conversation without bruising the listener. The stain on the ceiling dried into the shape of a country she would never visit, a coastline oddly faithful to some failure of plaster long ago, and she found herself tracing it with her eyes as though in another lifetime she had been a cartographer who believed the world could be made safe by being named thoroughly.\n\nFather Oliver\u2019s cough wore down to a lower rasp that fooled no one. He sat under a blanket that had belonged to two priors and a mouse and listened to her read with the attentiveness of a man allowing a voice to hold the parts of him that had grown unwieldy. She chose differently now without admitting it, set aside the Roman\u2019s roads for legends where people went on foot and found their way by smell and the kindness of small towns. \u201cAgnes of Rome,\u201d she read one afternoon because the name behaved like a hook in her mind and because she didn\u2019t want to ask who in the house would die first, \u201crefused what everyone called sensible, and the world did not break because of it, any more than a pond breaks when a bird steps on its own reflection.\u201d Father Oliver smiled without moving his mouth much and looked at the thin skin over his knuckles as if it had a better suggestion than his lungs did. \u201cNames are a comfort,\u201d he said, and when he leaned forward to cough into his handkerchief she pretended she did not see the red blooming there like a difficult thought.\n\nShe did the arithmetic she hated and came with it to Mother Heloise, who had balanced books that did not forgive and rules that did not remember who had asked for them. Heloise listened with her fingers folded into the shape of a house around a little air, and then she nodded once and sent Sister Verna to telephone Dr. Shanahan in a voice steady enough to make herself sound like a ship at anchor. The wire spoke back with its own lucidity\u2014 there would be a delay, there was weather, there was another woman nearer to birthing than to praying\u2014 and then there was the fact that a man whose lungs had decided to be winter could not wait like a sensible letter. \u201cWe\u2019ll fetch him,\u201d Heloise said, words heavy with the years they had behaved themselves and now brought to bear on a single useful disobedience. \u201cThe boy from the school?\u201d she added, and then looked at Ulriche\u2019s face and corrected herself without explanation. \u201cElias.\u201d\n\nUlriche found him in the yard turning snow away from the rosemary with a broom as if persuading a child that a bed was not a prison. He had grown cautious with his own hands, the way a man does who has learned that one part of him can throw the rest into muddle. He saw her and straightened and then did something she had not seen before; he put the broom down and stepped away from it as if it had power over him he hadn\u2019t consented to give. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asked, and his mouth had learned not to waste any words on fear in a moment that had chosen to carry more than one person\u2019s breathing.\n\n\u201cFather Oliver,\u201d she said, and the name brought the weight of the blanket and the red handkerchief and the foolish Roman roads into the courtyard where the rosemary smelled like winter\u2019s pocket. \u201cShanahan will come if we go fetch him. Heloise asks, and I\u2014 ask too.\u201d It was dangerous, the second request; it made the air thinner; it made the snow listen.\n\nHe blinked and did not look toward the gate, which is how you know a man has already made his decision and wishes to spare his body the disorientation of admitting it. \u201cI can,\u201d he said. There was a hinge in the present tense that opened a little and then closed. \u201cI will.\u201d He wiped both hands on the butchered knees of his trousers as if taking dirt off the flesh would make courage find better purchase. \u201cI\u2019ll get my coat,\u201d he added, and then paused, and the pause contained a road and a memory with small feet. \u201cYou\u2019ll come?\u201d he said, not because he needed permission from her to do what the world required, but because his breath would prefer company that remembered how to count.\n\nShe did not know that she would ever again have permission to say yes to that particular request, and so she said it now, before prudence could rise like a mother from the next room to put its hand on her head. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll hold the doctor\u2019s bag if he brings one. I\u2019ll hold my breath if I must.\u201d She went inside to get her shawl and when she returned Sister Agnes was already at the door with a hat she pretended had always been meant for Ulriche\u2019s head. \u201cKeep the teeth behind your lips,\u201d Agnes commanded softly, an instruction that could be read backward as well as forward, and Ulriche nodded in that way a person does when told something they know and fear with equal measure they will not be able to obey.\n\nThe car had been sulking under a fall of snow that made it appear more innocent than its history. Elias brushed it like a reluctant animal and opened the door with the courtesy of a man visiting a neighbor he does not favor but cannot ignore. Inside, the upholstery let out its stored breath, a warm, tired smell of wool and old road. \u201cIf I drive slow,\u201d he said, and didn\u2019t finish because the sentence had been proven inadequate in other contexts. She folded her skirt and put her hands flat on her knees the way a woman does in a pew when wondering whether God has noticed the bargain she is making with herself. The engine shivered, made up its mind, and then beheld the snow with the generous caution of something that had grown wise by breaking only once.\n\nThe road had turned into a chalk line pulled taught between one need and another. Houses wore their winter faces, the ones with the blinds at half-mast and the porches pretending they were not lonely. The wipers practiced a poor liturgy and then a better one; the glass set its own rhythm and they obeyed. Elias held the wheel the way a person holds a child who might sleep and might not, and Ulriche watched his knuckles and found out again that the body will grow tenderness toward anything that has not harmed it. She kept her eyes busy on the hedges at the edges of town, because she could not bear to watch the road with his kind of vigilance and also because she had read that the thing you watch for comes in by another door.\n\nThey reached the park where the squirrel had elected oblivion and the road under the tires changed its mind about being purely obedient. Elias\u2019s breath hitches were quiet and he kept the car\u2019s speed a sorrowful thing, a fairness paid out inch by inch so the world could not claim it had been rushed into injury. At the far corner, where the iron fence made a sharp suggestion, something came low and quick out of the little white and went to cross with the certainty of a creature which had been taught, elsewhere, that a line drawn by humans was nothing more than a childish mark. It was not a squirrel. The fox moved like handwriting in a language Ulriche could read but never write. Elias put his foot down on the brake with a care that did not make demands of the tires and set his own jaw as if to tell bone and tendon they were responsible for what came next. The fox looked at them, and the look had no accusation in it, only a question, and then it took its own answer away through the cemetery gate and did not look back to see if the people had earned anything from their caution.\n\nHe did not speak again until they turned onto Washington where the plow had been lazy. \u201cI thought it would be small again,\u201d he said, and then, after a minute in which his breath counted ladders between his ribs, \u201cIt is not small. It has a tail that keeps its own counsel.\u201d Ulriche did not tell him that this victory counted as a number in a ledger no one saw; she put one hand very lightly on the seat between them as if steadying a bowl that had been set down full.\n\nDr. Shanahan opened his office as though he had been expecting them and set his hat into a particular dent on a particular hook that suggested a measured faith that even towns can be taught by habit to be kind. He was a large man with a voice that had learned to be gentler than his shoulders. \u201cOliver,\u201d he said grimly when they said the name, and then added a phrase the Irish say when they mean to throw a rope into a well. \u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d He lifted his bag and then another smaller one and then, seeing Ulriche, put both on the counter and took out a blanket and wrapped it around her shoulders as if he were a village for a passing pilgrim. \u201cYou ride in the back with me,\u201d he said to Elias, as if there were no other arrangements possible now, and Elias nodded and moved with the obedient speed of a man who has promised himself a better later for today\u2019s risk.\n\nOn the return, the car discovered the geometry of obligation, which is always a triangle\u2014 the house, the person in it, the person fetching help\u2014 and tried to keep its feet under it. When they went by the park again, the snow lay over everything with impartiality that would have been a scandal if God had made taste instead of weather. Ulriche looked for footprints where the fox had been and saw none, which taught her something about the kind of tracks some beings leave and the kind others do not consent to leave even when it would comfort us. Shanahan looked at her with a sidelong kindness that said he understood more than he said about nuns and roads and men whose hands had decided to be careful forever. \u201cYou have a good man,\u201d he remarked, not meaning possession, and she allowed herself to be warmed by a sentence that would not stand if weighed and yet was exactly the right size for this car at this moment.\n\nThey poured into the sacristy like weather and came out smoothed by the boundary of holy things. Father Oliver allowed himself to be tired in front of Shanahan the way a man will allow himself to be seen by a stranger if the stranger is careful with time. There were tubes and names for winds inside a chest and injections that made warmth remember a path it had given up on. Ulriche stood with her hands joined and did and did not pray, which is the kind of pragmatic disobedience God has loved people for since the first stove was lit. Elias took his hat off and kept taking it off as if discovering again that he was bareheaded and that there was a dignity to be preserved at all costs. When it was time to move Oliver to the car, Elias lifted with the other men and made a sound with his throat that would not have been distinguished by a biologist from a cough, and yet Ulriche knew it for the thing it was\u2014 a reminder to his body that it was meant for bearing weight.\n\nThe hospital smelled like boiled linen and disinfected hope, which is a tolerable compromise in a town that measures itself honestly. Shanahan took Father Oliver in behind a curtain with the confidence of a man whose hands had never betrayed him at an altar or a table. Elias and Ulriche stayed in a corridor where a radiator ticked like an old insect. She remembered a night as a child when her father had come home with his own cough and set his medicine box on the kitchen table and taken out the vials and spoken to them like old friends who sometimes answered and sometimes didn\u2019t. The box had been lined in velvet and smelled like wintergreen; she had wanted to sleep in it, small as she was then. \u201cHe\u2019ll be made easier,\u201d Elias said, and she nodded, and then he looked at his own fingers as if counting what they had learned since the squirrel and since the fox. \u201cI did not hit the fox,\u201d he added, looking as if he were promising it to someone who would not be satisfied with the receipt and would prefer to examine the goods.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and nearly laughed at the grotesque inadequacy of thanking a man for not killing a creature he had never wanted to harm. \u201cYou will not unlearn it,\u201d she added softly, and when he frowned she clarified, \u201cThe feeling you have for the sudden thing that crosses. You will not unlearn it, and it will make you late often, and it will be worth it.\u201d\n\nThey drove back under a sky that had run out of adjectives and settled for being a color that agreed with roofs. The car felt more docile now that it had been made the servant of a rescue and not a threat. At the gate Elias exhaled slowly, a boy discovering he had survived a dive off a rock. He put the car to bed like a horse rubbed down and let his hand rest on the hood a second longer than use demanded. \u201cIf I drive again,\u201d he said, with the shy arrogance of a promise, \u201cit will be for some living thing.\u201d Ulriche almost said that squirrels are living things and then did not, trusting the part of him that would not let himself forget to supply that fact later when the house was asleep and his mind was doing its cruel inventory.\n\nThe days rearranged themselves as days do after a crisis that has not ended but has put on a soft collar. Father Oliver\u2019s bed at the hospital became a place where the nuns took turns being still, which proved to be harder work than the world gave it credit for. Ulriche brought books and did not open them and brought silence and did not fill it, which is a virtue often mislabeled as absence. When she went back to the library the books on the screens were ready to be coaxed into standing like adults, and she set them upright with the ceremony their returned spines asked of her. On one of the endpapers, a child had once drawn a cat whose tail was longer than its life, and the water had blurred it into something like weather, and she stood looking at that cat as though it were trying to tell her something about persistence that had nothing to do with clarity. Maribeth drifted in and put a sheet of paper where Ulriche had left none and wrote on it with her finger. \u201cIt says,\u201d she whispered, though she did not lift her voice above the rustle air makes on paper, \u201cyou are allowed to keep loving with your eyes and not your hands.\u201d\n\nThe fox developed a habit of being seen only by people who did not talk about foxes. Sister Verna believed strongly that it was a saint in a low costume and left bits of laurel at the fencepost nearest the far lot as an experiment in interspecies diplomacy. Bettina snorted and muttered about hens and vowed to make the girls\u2019 crowns tighter next year so no saint, animal or otherwise, could tip a flame in passing. Elias checked the fence for the third time in a week and found places where a fox had taken liberties without sinning, which is a trick not all animals nor all men can manage. When he showed Ulriche the bent wire he had straightened, his hands aligning the world with that stubborn male tenderness tools respond to, she nearly touched his wrist again and then folded her fingers inside her sleeve until they forgot the impulse.\n\nIn the kitchen Bettina took ruthlessness out of the cupboard and used it on turnips, making them obedient to stew whether they liked it or not. She dried rosemary in bundles that looked like soldiers\u2019 memories hung to smoke. \u201cI\u2019ll put it in the marinade for the lamb,\u201d she told Ulriche, as if offering her a treaty rather than a flavor. \u201cChristmas doesn\u2019t care for lavender, and cinnamons have their own committees.\u201d Ulriche smiled and agreed not to argue about herbs with a woman who had taught her more than one lesson at a cutting board.\n\nOn Gaudete Sunday the Mass wore rose, a color that made winter seem like a possibility rather than a sentence. The girls took it as an opportunity to giggle behind the ends of their veils, sniffing the altar flowers like bees pretending to be devout. Father Oliver sent a note on a stiff card delivered by Shanahan\u2019s nurse that said only: \u201cDon\u2019t let them skip the third verse. There\u2019s a hole there that holds the sky up.\u201d Ulriche read it twice and put it in the back pocket of the missal and felt as if she had placed her hand on the small of the chapel\u2019s back. After the service she went to the courtyard alone and listened to the bowl consulting the cold. The ice had learned to go opaque at the center where light was presumptuous. She pressed her skin to it, broke it, and put the shards aside neatly the way a woman puts aside a thought for later with the full intention of forgetting to come back.\n\nElias began to whistle again, a fractured sound repairing itself over the course of a week until there was a sequence that might have been learned from a thrush and might just as easily have been borrowed from a hymn sung badly by someone standing two pews behind him. He did not look at the bowl when he passed it, but he stopped smoothing the burlap around the rosemary as if it were a shroud and started to tuck it as if it were a blanket. \u201cBrother Flint thinks snow is just rain in a coat,\u201d he told Ulriche one afternoon, and blushed at his own complicity with an invention, then went on, stubborn as a man teaching himself a habit he wishes had come with his first teeth, \u201cbut the rats don\u2019t write letters about weather and yet they still come. I set traps. I talk to them apologetically, and then I don\u2019t apologize again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to be tidy about vermin,\u201d she said, and he looked at her as if she had granted him a small indulgence in the economy of his moral bookkeeping. \u201cYou\u2019ll go to the hospital,\u201d she added, daring the suggestion the way a person dares the edge of a pond with a foot. \u201cWhen it is your day off. He\u2019ll want to hear about the cabbages even if he pretends he did not ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him,\u201d Elias said, and then frowned at the ground because he had promised himself not to speak lies even when they were wishes in disguise. \u201cI\u2019ll try. It smells like boiled bones in there,\u201d he admitted, relieved to be base in front of someone who had also been seen by the smell. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to put my hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse them,\u201d she said simply, and then made herself laugh because she had soundly deserved to be laughed at for that foolish sentence and because laughter kept the skin from getting too tight around her throat. \u201cOn the rail of the bed,\u201d she amended. \u201cOn the heavy end of a book if he will let you. On your own knees.\u201d\n\nHe nodded slowly, as if learning to read a long vowel in a strange word. He went that evening, hat in hand, and came back with a patient\u2019s name in his mouth that sounded like something he had been entrusted to carry and not to show off. \u201cHe asked about the compost,\u201d he said to Ulriche in the hall, and then because he had been brave once and seen the world not end he added, \u201cHe said to turn it, rats be damned. He used stronger words,\u201d which made her look at her feet so she wouldn\u2019t have to hold in her face the pleasure she took in the idea of Father Oliver swearing as a tonic.\n\nChristmas Eve was a practical day, which is not how Christmas Eve gets written down in books but is how it behaves in a house that has to make soup for a number that never corresponds with bodies at the table. Bettina stalked through the kitchen with a spoon that had instructed generations of sauces to behave, and Heloise carried her authority like a hot pie, not to be touched by anyone else but meant to be shared. Sister Verna lost the frankincense for twenty minutes and found it again at the bottom of a drawer full of disused laces, which she took as a sign that smell, like God, chose to appear where it pleased. The children were excused from their lessons and made up rituals out of whatever came to hand, wreathing a statue in paper chains and inventing on the spot the tradition that this particular corner must be bowed to for three days under pain of weather, which Heloise permitted on fewer conditions than usual because she understood the economy of indulgence.\n\nIn the late afternoon the snow softened into something the air could lift in handfuls and scatter. Ulriche dressed herself with the care that belongs to the armoring of ordinary things, black upon black, a pin at her collar that had once belonged to her mother and had the modesty to pretend it did not remember another woman\u2019s heat. She stood at her door with the intention of not moving until someone called, as a penance for the pleasure she took in the preparations. Agnes breezed by, made of starch and advice, and then came back as if memory had tugged her veil. \u201cYou will do the reading,\u201d she said, brisk and without asking, and Ulriche felt the words stand up inside her like a small regiment.\n\nShe held the text at the lectern later, and the candle flames worked at their edges like men sawing a plank to fit a stubborn frame. She read with a voice that had been taught to be more obedient than any other part of her, and she found in the old sentences room for meanings that had been left there like coins under a floorboard. \u201cIn the days of Caesar Augustus,\u201d she said, and the boys in the front row thought of roads without knowing why, and the girls thought of girls, and the old women thought of kitchens that had held children and not enough bread and a patience that had saved two lives at least. When she reached the part with the angel, she let herself have the smallest pause, the length of the time it takes a fox to decide whether to cross, and then said, \u201cFear not,\u201d as if it were a thing she herself might do on a good day and not just a performance she was hired for.\n\nThe Mass spun out, a thread that knew its business, and afterward there was the peculiar holiday emptiness that comes when work has held a body upright for hours and relinquishes its grip. Ulriche went to the bowl because there was no other place in the convent where she could stand and be seen by something that did not have rules it thought it had invented. The ice was formed and forming, and she broke it neatly and set the shards aside like fallen host cut wrong. She felt cold in her teeth and thought of Saint Apollonia and smiled at the ridiculousness of a woman who liked symbols putting her mouth to winter as if it were a relic. Elias came into the courtyard then and did not approach the bowl, careful in a new way with the spaces she occupied. He had a small packet in his hand, wrapped in paper that had contained screws and made no claims to beauty. \u201cFor you,\u201d he said, not moving closer because sometimes kindness needs distance to remain what it is. \u201cFor your books.\u201d\n\nShe opened it later in the library under the lamp that made even poor paper look considerate. It was a set of thin, hand-cut wedges of cedar, smooth and smelling like apologies, with tiny clothespins glued to one end. He had made them with a hand that had decided to be precise. A note was folded with them in that difficult, cramped writing men develop when someone once told them their words had better fit into small spaces if they intended to be heard at all. It said: \u201cTo keep them open without breaking them.\u201d She sat with it, with the smell of cedar making the air about her behave like a cupboard, and she allowed herself to let her throat move once as if she had swallowed water wrong. She took one wedge and slid it into a book that had insisted on closing itself as if it still trusted the memory of a flood, and she watched the pages relax like the hand of a sleeping child.\n\nThe bowl froze deep that night and did not forgive her finger\u2019s polite knock. She went to bed and dreamed of a country whose border was the water stain on the library ceiling and whose anthem was a whistle that could not decide whether to be bird or boy. In the dream, Father Oliver walked along the border and then lay down and became it in a way that did not hurt him. When she woke, the candle was out and the dark was behaving as if it had been told that she preferred it. She put her feet on the cold and blessed it for being honest about itself.\n\nMorning moved without asking anyone what they wanted it to be. There were packages on the refectory table that had been wrapped in old maps and tied with the string that had come around potatoes in months when potatoes had not tasted of cellars. The girls had drawn saints on labels with features so fierce they would have frightened wolves and delighted the saints themselves. Bettina had made bread that cracked with an integrity you could hear from the next room, and Verna had found a way to brew coffee that did not offend anyone\u2019s sense of proportion. Elias had set a sprig of rosemary at every place as if it were a social equal, and Heloise had made peace with that in advance because she understood the delicate economy of letting a man think a table was his idea.\n\nA letter came after breakfast, a rare bird on gray paper with the diocese\u2019s seal that had always reminded Ulriche of snakes constrained by good manners into a circle. Heloise read it and put it down and looked for a wall to let her back learn from. \u201cThey are sending us a deacon,\u201d she said finally, and the room\u2019s air rearranged itself because new men make air adjust even when they are good. \u201cFor Epiphany. He\u2019ll be here a while to learn where we put our chairs.\u201d Bettina muttered that chairs moved for no man and then looked guilty because she knew some chairs had been put in a room in the last year that could not be moved and still have the room be what it was. Verna clapped her hands once and asked whether he liked honey, and no one answered because it was a question from a language that would require a dictionary.\n\nUlriche put her head down over the ledger she pretended to keep and felt a small bristle of dislike that embarrassed her. She did not want another man with a cough or a different sort of certainty. She did not want someone to come and stand in the doorways Elias stood in and then be gone again with his shoes full of the dust of their halls. She did not want to share the good burden of reading and of flowers pressed between pages and of small, necessary lies told to old books for their good. She wrote \u201ccandles\u201d three times in the margin and then crossed them out and told herself sternly not to invent a future that had not been invited.\n\nThe fox left prints that evening on the cloister walk, a neat scandal. They stopped where the stone took back its smooth and the snow could not hold any more stories. Maribeth came with her coat open and her breath sincere and whispered, as if they were all in on some age-old secret, \u201cHe goes under. He has learned doors we didn\u2019t tell him.\u201d Ulriche knelt and put her fingers into one track and found the cold there the brave kind, the kind that does not bite until asked. She thought of the bowl, of cedar wedges, of the way men and animals learn to pass through and to stop, and she felt gratitude rise in her like something boiled for a long time on a small burner finally ready to feed.\n\nShe wrote a note to Father Oliver that night, a page longer than she would have permitted a girl in her class. She told him about the fox and about the wedges and about the third verse and how it had held and about the rosemary and about the way Heloise put her hand on the doorframe when she was thinking because the wood had an opinion. She did not tell him she had ridden in a car beside Elias and watched him not hit the fox because it felt like a confession and not a report, and confessions belong to rooms with grates and poor cushions. She tucked the note into the pocket of the nurse with the sober shoes and went back to the library to put another book upright and another and another, whispering to herself the names of saints and herbs and the girls with the hair that made her remember what color means under rules. It was enough, this work, for a night that was supposed to be holy and instead was merely correctly sized for the heart she had and the house she had been given to keep.\n\nIn the first days of the new year a wind began that had answers and no questions. It made the old windows in their long frames go thin with opinion and the doors confess their gaps. Elias wrapped the pipes in the outbuildings with felt like scarves and set bricks against the bottom of the door that led to the yard where the trash had its democracy and the rats had their constitutions. He came to the library at midday with his hands scrubbed and his hat in his fingers and stood almost where he had stood with the wedges. \u201cHe sent a card,\u201d he said, and when she looked at him in puzzlement he added, \u201cOliver. To me.\u201d He fumbled in his pocket and produced a rectangle of thick paper with a cough pressed into the corner like a signature by a second hand. It said, in Father Oliver\u2019s tight failing letters, I was wrong about Cicero. He loved his daughter and the roads. They weren\u2019t roads. They were the way out. Elias held the card as if it had a temperature, and she had to stop herself from reaching to feel it. \u201cHe says it to me,\u201d he said, still bewildered, \u201cas if I had been in the room when the Romans decided things.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were,\u201d she answered, and before he could argue she pressed the card back into his hand. \u201cKeep it. There are some sentences that are loaned to a person and some that need a drawer.\u201d\n\nEpiphany brought the deacon wrapped in a coat too thin for people who did not know him. His name was Rafe, which made the girls snicker and then arrange their faces toward the altar with that ferocious virtue children can summon as quickly as mischief. He was smaller than his idea of himself, which is a workable ratio for men who must survive among women who do not have patience for their monologues but have plenty for their good works. He spoke in the clear, quick manner of someone who had rehearsed humility in a mirror and found it fits if you adjust the shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll be no trouble,\u201d he told Heloise, which was the same as promising to be a kind of trouble that could not be predicted. He liked the library with the imprecise fondness of a man who had been praised for reading and punished for it in the same winter. He shook hands with Elias and looked at the rosemary and said, \u201cMy mother planted some between stones,\u201d and Elias said, \u201cIt survives what would prefer it not,\u201d and they nodded at something that did not require a priest.\n\nUlriche watched this new shape moving through their days and felt her heart tighten its habits around itself and then loosen, chastened by its own rudeness. Rafe had a way of standing aside when she walked by that did not call attention to the fact that he had stood aside, and she remembered herself enough to welcome him with a thin slice of bread cut just right and a sprig of rosemary placed on his plate as if it had always been his. He did not give lectures to girls who did not ask for them, which was a miracle she did not wish to name aloud in case God thought she was collecting them and decided to balance her books. He listened, which is either a trick or a gift and sometimes both, and when he asked questions they were the sort you can answer without being made into a museum.\n\nOne evening, late in the month when weather turns on its heel and pretends it will go before deciding to stay another week just to see if you are serious, Ulriche went to the far lot because Maribeth had sworn by three different forgotten minor saints that the fox had left a different kind of message. The snow lay in small, agreeing drifts and the fence leaned with dignity. There, under the elm that had known three generations of children climbing it and two of men falling out of it, the fox had relieved itself with the narrative richness animals prefer. Maribeth crouched beside it with a reverence that would have embarrassed the bishop. \u201cSeeds of something that came from somewhere we don\u2019t have,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDo you see? He brings what we are not.\u201d Ulriche laughed, low and without fear, and felt how the body can be glad for a creature\u2019s indifferent generosity. Elias came across the lot then, hatless and humming, and stopped at the sight, and then he did something he had not done since the morning he turned over the bowl; he let the tune continue even when he realized he was singing.\n\nLater in the library, when the dark made a small agreeable room out of the world and the lamp drew a circle around the work table that felt like a coven of useful women, Ulriche took out her notebook and turned to a page that did not bear Jude\u2019s name or any other excuse. She wrote without crossing out: The fox\u2019s gift is not the animal itself but the result of its refusal to hold everything in. The gardener\u2019s gift is not what he grows but the arrangement of his care. The priest\u2019s gift is not his lungs but his sentences and the gap he leaves where we put our breath. She stopped, surprised at herself, and then added, with a small fury at the honesty of it, My gift is that I know where the water goes and when to break it, and I cannot pretend any longer that this is an accident. Agnes rustled in the cupboard like a woman rearranging quilts and said without stepping fully into the room, \u201cYou have to stop talking to yourself as if you were a congregation.\u201d Ulriche laughed, obedient for once, and closed the book on her hand and felt its weight, the way a woman feels a child sleeping and knows she cannot move for a while without changing what the night will remember.Chapter Seven\n\nRafe learned the sound of the house the way a new man learns the sound of his own boots. He did not stride where stepping would do, and when he laughed it fit under the beams without making them wonder whether they were equal to the task of holding it. He came into the library with his hat in his hands like a man about to apologize to a room for having to pass through it and set the hat down on the corner of the desk as if it were a delicate argument he did not intend to pursue. He liked the smell of the resinous drying pages and said, with a generosity that made Ulriche forgive him a little for being planted here by people who drew maps on other people\u2019s lives, that he had never seen a place recover its breath so tidily. The children took to him because he knew where his hands were, which is a knowledge few men carry into rooms filled with girls and books, and because when he told them a story he did not keep it on a leash. After a week he asked quietly, as if he were not asking for more of Ulriche than she could afford just then, whether the parish might hold catechism in the library on Tuesday evenings, the winter making it hard to keep small bodies upright in the church when their toes were staging revolts inside their shoes.\n\nUlriche looked at the ledger she had improved by writing in its margins and thought of the hour between Vespers and Compline, which belonged to a kind of quiet that had her name on it, and of the way the library grew a skin in the evenings that could be bruised by talk. Her impulse was to guard the room the way Bettina guarded knives, but Rafe\u2019s question had been asked in the tone a person uses when he is offering his throat for inspection by a dog; it would be cruel to bite. She took the matter to Mother Heloise, whose mind liked to set new habits to the right of old ones and make them promise to keep their hands to themselves, and Heloise nodded and said, with a practicality that loved both children and libraries almost to the point of theft, \u201cYes. Let them come, but not with their boots dripping. We will teach the door to pay attention.\u201d\n\nThe first evening a troop of boys and girls came in with hats like small, respectful storms in their arms and breathing that could not be persuaded to go down as far as their stomachs. Rafe had them lay their mittens on the radiator in a row and recited, with an earnestness that made even Verna approve, the prayer for beginning study as if it had been written specifically for mittens that wanted to be useful. Ulriche watched from behind the desk and counted the number of times her teeth touched when she meant them not to, more often than she liked, because the cold had found a pocket in her jaw and kept its treasures there. She handed out catechisms with the smooth satisfaction of a dealer of cards in a game no one loses and listened to Rafe teach the children the habit of asking better questions than the ones the answers had prepared for.\n\nElias built a little row of cold frames along the wall that faced the weak sun with a stubborn good cheer, using old sash windows he had coaxed out of a shed that had been practicing being haunted. He set their slanted glass against cedar that smelled like things that deserved forgiveness and tucked burlap like blankets and then untucked it to check the sleeping things with the guilty pleasure of a father who claims to be checking only the stove. He waved to Ulriche through the library window with the hand he had not hurt years ago and then, as she returned the wave, used the other hand reflexively to press the cold frame lid down, a habit he had picked up from the fox and from himself. The bowl in the gravel had grown a hairline crack that widened on the bright days and pretended to heal on the dull, the way certain sins do, and she ran her fingers over it in the mornings as if a human hand could persuade clay to mend itself because it was loved. Elias brought another, a shallow earthen dish that had once been meant for a pie and now had a more secular life, and set it beside the bowl with the tact that people use when introducing two friends who might prefer not to see each other but will share a table if they must.\n\nHer tooth began to speak the way a beehive speaks when the air changes. It did not insist, not at first, but then it set up a private industry under her cheek and sent its workers to the door with their small stinging arguments whenever she tried to forget them. At Lauds she felt the Latin slide past and catch on that little place of pain the way a thread catches on a nicked nail, and she closed her lips around the word because saying it would have rattled the hive. Bettina noticed, as women notice everything that matters when not invited to, and said, with her spoon lifted as a scepter, \u201cClove for it,\u201d and then added, because she could not refrain from a fling at the other truth, \u201cand Shanahan if clove behaves like poetry.\u201d\n\nUlriche put a clove on her tongue and let it burn, polite in a way that illicit heat is polite, and at first the pain turned under its blanket and slept. Then, one cold morning when the bells came in close like geese and her breath distributed itself unevenly through her chest, the tooth opened its window and let all its aching out at once. She knelt in the chapel and tried to remember Saint Apollonia\u2019s face from the print that had hung in the hall when she was little, the one with the tongs and the calm smile, a sort of domestic courage, and said without teeth moving, \u201cAll right,\u201d which is a prayer that admits both defeat and the kind of victory that happens when a woman knows where pain is going and invites it to meet her halfway.\n\nRafe, who had learned in a week that every woman in the house would rather someone be useful than empathetic, found her wrapping a strip of linen around her jaw like a modesty and said, in the tone of a man offering directions he is willing to walk himself, \u201cLet me take you to Shanahan.\u201d He blurted it and then blushed because in his eagerness not to ask Elias he had made himself the sort of man who hustles a nun to a doctor like a cousin and not a colleague. Ulriche would have said yes to anyone at that hour, and the thought of Elias\u2019s knuckles white on the wheel, the long carefulness of him, made her both calmer and more afraid; the two emotions shook hands inside her and therefore she said to Rafe, who had hands built to lift doctrine rather than a woman\u2019s discomfort, \u201cAll right,\u201d and he bobbed his head as if he had been named temporary road.\n\nThey went in the convent\u2019s own car because it had found humility once and did not imagine itself equal to any speed a man might favor. Rafe drove the way he had learned to read\u2014 careful of the margins, deliberate at the commas, slowing for anything that might be a clause. He talked in little segments that he assured himself were useful because silence had a way of suggesting to people that priests were thinking about their souls instead of about potholes and the necessity of the tires. \u201cShanahan\u2019s kind,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has a pocket in his coat for pain and it leaves wearing a different hat,\u201d and she nodded because if she opened her mouth she would be found out by her own breath.\n\nThe waiting room smelled like the coats of people who did not talk to one another in public and liked it that way. Shanahan\u2019s nurse had a competence that had defied three generations of sorrow and taught two boys not to speak unless asked. She tapped Ulriche\u2019s wrist once, as if telling her that the body would be returned mostly intact, and then led her in to the room where the dentist\u2019s chair faced the window and the winter and a maple that thought it had seen everything. Shanahan himself put a wide hand on the back of the chair as if introducing it to her as a patient old horse and said nothing until the instruments had made their small due announcements to the air. He peered into the place that had made itself the center of her and touched with the gentleness of a man who has always loved women\u2019s mouths for their voices and not their shapes and then nodded gravely as if at last he had found the name of something he had suspected.\n\n\u201cIt must come,\u201d he said, and she nodded, and Rafe, who had his eyes honestly closed as if giving her privacy and himself the illusion of not being complicit, nodded too like a man listening to a hymn he does not know all the verses to. Shanahan\u2019s hand was heat and hygiene. There was the peculiar intimacy of a man asking for a woman\u2019s trust with a steel hook in his hand and her consent making the room an honest place. He spoke to the tooth as if apologizing in advance for being good at this particular cruelty. \u201cForgive me,\u201d he said to any saint listening, and Ulriche thought, with a ridiculous steadiness, that it would be just like God to forgive the man while letting the small white thing go without benediction.\n\nThe pull was both a relief and the most insulting moment of the season. It made a noise like an old wardrobe confessing it had been shut too long, and then there was in her mouth a sudden removal of a very specific weight she had not known she had been carrying. She tasted the proud bright of blood and the medicinal cotton that pretended to care and closed her eyes on the unhandsome prickling that came when the body agreed to be improved by pain. Shanahan put the thing into a small white envelope with a propriety that surprised her and then, as if he had seen that she intended the odd ritual of wanting to hold her own vanquished part, he pressed the envelope into her palm with a tenderness that made Ulriche think briefly of those men who hold their children once with awe and afterwards with competence.\n\nShe walked out with Rafe into the winter and the air was honest with her about every edge. Rafe did not speak until they were in the car and it was breathing again like a good dog, and then he said, carefully because he was a man who could think two things at once and not be made visibly ill by it, \u201cApollonia would have approved of your stubbornness,\u201d and Ulriche, whose mouth welcomed that saint\u2019s name too fully, laughed and then put her fingers against the cotton and scolded herself. The road back had the charity of familiarity, and when they passed the park, it was only trees and fence and a paper cup blown by any wind\u2019s democracy, and Ulriche understood that fear has to take its turn like anybody else at a gate. She leaned her head back and watched the small trapped condensation make missionaries of their breath against the glass and thought of Elias\u2019s careful foot on a pedal and the way his cautions had turned into a kind of faith.\n\nShe did not keep the envelope long. In the garden, when dusk had learned the names of the shrubs and was therefore refusing to leave politely, she went to the rosemary that had survived the apprentice winter and knelt on the gravel like a woman proposing and not expecting to be accepted. The earth was hard and did not pretend otherwise. She lifted a little crust of it with a spade as if uncovering a story told badly and set the envelope in as though it were a seed that would sprout something that would not embarrass anyone. She covered it and smoothed it with a palm and the ridiculous pleasure of making anything straight and then spoke aloud, because the bowl had taught her that sometimes speaking to inanimate things is a kind of sense, \u201cYou can have that bit, then,\u201d and the rosemary, which did not answer, smelled like a memory she would prefer not to stop having.\n\nWhen she rose, Elias was there on the other side of the cold frame, his hat pulled low in a way that made the top half of his face seem private and his mouth public, which embarrassed them both. He looked at her without the hungry attention of a man seeking a reason to be involved and with the steady attention of someone who has learned not to flinch when another person steps into their own hurt. \u201cAll right?\u201d he asked, and she nodded, and then, because the space in which they stood had never been quite so tenderly honest, he added, \u201cI\u2019m glad you went.\u201d She would have said that Rafe had driven her, that Shanahan had pulled, that Apollonia had smiled terribly, but he was not asking for logistics. She lifted her hand and showed him her palm as if the lines there might have recorded the extraction and he would nod in the manner of a man who understands maps.\n\nThe wind stood up that night and remained standing to prove it knew how. It came down off the river with the confidence of a relative who has never been refused a meal and rattled the cold frames and found, with an impudent finger, the one knot in the burlap that had been tied by a woman thinking about a tooth and not the perfections of twine. At Matins the walls agreed to hold. At two the glass spoke to itself in its thin tongue and at three a plate from Bettina\u2019s shelf did not. Ulriche lay awake and listened to the old hierarchy of sounds\u2014 pipes pleading, beams negotiating, Agnes turning over phrases in the wardrobe and choosing to keep half for morning\u2014 and then the wind addressed her specifically under the sill and she smiled into the pillow because of the ridiculousness of being flattered by air. She rose, put the shawl around her in the way women have learned that makes their hands free without losing heat, and went into the courtyard because the rosemary had adopted her tooth and it seemed only fair to stand guard at its small inheritance.\n\nThe burlap had come loose and was now performing a dance taught back in goat-days, flapping in a measure that the rosemary did not know the steps to. She caught it and the wind made a sentence out of the cloth and her arms, leaving her feeling, briefly, like a flag. The sky had the sort of cloud that looked like something mothered only long enough to be put down again, and snow came at her with reasonable arguments. She knelt to retie and the twine, which had been spun by someone in another winter and stored in a drawer that held buttons and a single pencil, resisted in the way of all cordage asked to become form. She blew on her fingers in that old, good superstition and spoke nonsense after them and tied one knot and then another, a seaman under a bad moon.\n\nElias came through the arch without a sound the building considered polite. He had no coat on over his shirt and his eyes were the exact color of returning to bed. \u201cDon\u2019t scold me,\u201d he said softly before she could scold him, \u201cand I won\u2019t scold you,\u201d and they knelt with the burlap between them like a reluctant altar. He held the loose end with a competence that never raised its voice and she formed the loop as if she were writing a letter to someone who insisted on being surprised by the post. The wind tugged at them like a child dizzy with sleep, and she shifted, and his hand came, orchestrally, to her wrist because the knife in her palm had slipped and a finger that worked in the library had no business being made foolishly shorter in a garden in January. He didn\u2019t even say the word careful, but it was there in the angle of his thumb and in the way he surrendered the space back to her once the loop had admitted the knot\u2019s teeth.\n\nThey finished and sat back on their heels without taking their eyes off the thing, as if it had been a horse that had consented not to run and might reconsider. Their breath made brief small worlds at the height of their mouths. He said, after a minute that did not advertise the hour, \u201cBrother Flint told me this knot once,\u201d and she laughed soundlessly because the Twosday man with the clacking teeth belonged now to both of them with equal parts of irony and sincerity. \u201cOf course he did,\u201d she said, and then felt suddenly a sweep of relief so wide she would have fallen into it if she hadn\u2019t had the gravel under her knees to remind her about proportion. The rosemary exhaled because it had been startled and then told a better story about why, and they went inside by separate doors with the gentle, ridiculous solemnity of people leaving the scene of something that had not happened and yet had.\n\nIn the days following, Father Oliver\u2019s cough wrote smaller letters. He sent notes down with Shanahan\u2019s nurse, who took off her outer patience coat just outside the door every time and left it on the peg like a good, heavy garment. Once the note said only the word warm, as if he were trialing adjectives the way people trial little spoons of stew to see which one the season prefers, and once it said, with the off-brand humor he carried like a flask, Anything that has a third verse should also have a fourth. She sent him back a library stamp on a scrap of paper and the date due, which made him laugh enough to produce an occasion he pretended was unrelated in his handkerchief. Elias went every Thursday now, and his ears had learned the geography of the hospital corridor in a way his heart had not, and when he came back he said fewer words but they weighed more, which is a trick only certain men and all good stones manage.\n\nRafe did not get in the way of any of this, which is a sentence that recommends him even to people suspicious of temporary men. He took the girls to the far lot and held the chalk while they wrote the year and the initials over the door, explaining with a seriousness that did not require belief that the letters stood for both names and a prayer and a sentence that sounded like a benediction. He watched the fox\u2019s path with a particularity that suggested he had known other creatures who knew where to put their feet, and when Sister Verna asked him for some complicated permission involving honey and saints and a cupboard, he listened and said yes, knowing that whatever he had authorized he would hear about later if the honey behaved like a sacrament all over the linens. He asked Ulriche once, in a corridor, whether there was a patron for librarians, and when she told him that there were too many to choose from and therefore the sensible thing was not to decide which one was supposed to be holding up her roof, he nodded as if she had expressed a doctrine he could repeat in a pulpit without getting in trouble.\n\nThe fox learned the hour of the bells and the minute before them. Sometimes Ulriche would catch a sliver of it through the glass like a piece of burnt orange thought, an idea of warmth moving through cold with too much grace to be suspected of theft. Once, when she bent to pick up a book whose binding had turned old without becoming brittle, there was a small shock in the room like a clock consenting to go again and a scent that had no right in winter\u2014 cracked apple, mouse-nest, the brief, indecent breath of wild. Maribeth raised her head from a stack of cards and whispered, \u201cUnder the gate\u2014 he can make his ribs like lace,\u201d and Ulriche thought of her own ribs and of the rib that had once been removed to make a woman and how many versions of that story human creatures keep inventing in their houses and their minds.\n\nMara appeared as if the fox\u2019s name were an invitation to children that this was a day when poems would be understood more than usually. She had a paper in her hand and a little crack in her lip from the weather and the kind of patience people reserve for long trains and good bread. \u201cI wrote one about the bowl,\u201d she announced gravely, and read, with the breath control of a nine-year-old soprano, \u201cBowl in snow, a hat for sky, a place for birds to check their faces, thin as frost and twice as brave.\u201d Ulriche applauded with her fingers against her palm and felt her mouth weight ease a fraction, like a thing that had been balancing and decided to be held by gravity again just this once for a friend. \u201cThat\u2019s not how bowls are,\u201d Mara added, as if anticipating criticism by men who keep warehouses of nouns, \u201cbut it\u2019s how they wish,\u201d and Elias, who was passing with a coil of hose he would not use until April, said, \u201cYes,\u201d in a voice that made the new deacon look up and learn, in an instant, where in the syllables of a gardener a person should not place uninvited weight.\n\nSnow loosened around the edges of the beds like a collar unbuttoned at last. The cold frames sweated politely in the mornings and showed Ulriche a hint of green no one had ordered from a catalog, which made her think of all the things the earth keeps under its tongue to pull out in company if the conversation lags. She lifted a lid when Elias was not looking, because she had promised herself to be a woman who sometimes disobeyed small instructions in order to remain honest, and the warmth that rose was almost obscene, like catching someone\u2019s shoulder without warning and discovering they were human. Tiny seeds had split themselves and were thinking hard about what to do next. She put the lid back as if protecting the tender trouble of too many possibilities and went away with the feeling in her hands of a secret that would bear telling, but not yet, because some announcements need to be born with their coats on.\n\nAgnes continued to be wherever Ulriche needed to be corrected and nowhere she might be thanked. \u201cYou are walking about with your mouth unbalanced,\u201d she hissed one afternoon from the broom closet, and Ulriche said, with a bright about-to-be-true tone that she had learned from men who argue, that she was entirely balanced and wholly oriented and her mouth was behaving like a saint. \u201cFewer dramas,\u201d Agnes countered, rustling as if through tissue paper on which a gown had been folded for thirty years, \u201cand more washing of cups. Don\u2019t make me have to warn you about hope.\u201d Ulriche, who was a woman who could hold more than one thing in her hands at once, was both irritated and grateful, and she cleaned the little cups people had thoughtlessly abandoned on the window ledge because forgiveness begins with being annoyed and bending anyway.\n\nWhen Father Oliver returned at last\u2014 not recovered but rearranged\u2014 he came into the chapel by the side door with the small noise of a man asking very much to be allowed to sit down. He wore his blanket around his shoulders as if he were an old prophet who had given up prophecy and taken up grammar, and the girls turned toward him with a relief they were too good to make a show of. He had less of him in some places and more in others. His eyes had gone wide again, a boy\u2019s in the face of an animal he has never been permitted to keep, and he took Ulriche\u2019s hand and put it under his and then on top of his and then took it away, as if reminding her that this franchise would be revoked later and she ought to enjoy it now. \u201cThe roads,\u201d he said, because the body carries its last argument into all rooms, \u201care not for leaving, they\u2019re for returning,\u201d and she nodded and did not tell him that these, in Salem, were often the same action.\n\nHe asked her to read, and she read for him with her voice, and then he asked Elias to tell him about the heap and whether it steamed properly even in weather that would have persuaded a less purposeful pile to forget what warmth was. Elias didn\u2019t step forward, because he was not a man who took three strides into any man\u2019s breath for a conversation unless summoned with a hand, and he spoke from his proper distance and said, \u201cIt remembers itself,\u201d and Father Oliver laughed until he coughed and then laughed because he had coughed and then coughed because he had laughed, and everyone behaved as if this were not a circle that should be broken with two kind hands. Rafe stood at the back and watched the old priest\u2019s mouth move around words that cut roadways in the air and did not try to step on them or improve them with gravel, which made Ulriche like him a little better and then feel immediately ungracious for keeping such a ledger.\n\nThat evening, when the bowl wore a new thin plate and the fox\u2019s path had chosen a wilder geometry across the far lot, Ulriche went out with a kettle and poured a ring of hot around the cold and watched the cut widen itself with the theatrical patience of a good cloth being torn and then folded neatly. She felt all her little losses settle like birds on a wire that had been strung for exactly this purpose and thought of teeth and pins and small, proper envelopes and the one knot in the burlap that had chosen now to be the stronger because someone had tied it with their mind inside their hands and not spinning out ahead into fields of if. The bells began to speak to the evening as if it had not been here before, and she stood long enough for her breath to be mistaken by a passerby for someone else\u2019s. Then she went in with the kettle emptied and set it upside down to dry and wrote on a scrap of paper: \u201cWe keep what we can by giving it to the right part of the ground,\u201d and tucked it into the crack in the wall where she kept ironic prayers and a list of people who would understand being kept in a wall.Chapter Eight\n\nCandlemas came down the calendar with both feet, bringing with it the sense that winter, having proved its point, could be persuaded to share its tools. Beeswax surfaced in drawers where ordinary days never asked for it. Bettina unrolled bundles of candle-sticks with the air of someone taking a dowry out of long storage, sniffing the sweet fat smell with a look of professional suspicion that anything could be so obliging and not be plotting. Rafe practiced the blessing in a voice that did not yet have the dust of old incense in it and therefore was as clean as a new floor. The girls, who had evolved within a week from skeptics about throat-candles to connoisseurs, argued quietly about which pair would make their coughing grandmothers safer without being showy. Ulriche kept inventory of wicks and thought, with a small pleased ache, that there are mercies made to be lifted and mercies made to burn.\n\nThe bowl had split all across one side as if it had considered being a moon. Ulriche found the crack with her thumb one morning and felt in her chest the unreasonable sense of betrayal that comes when an object refuses to be more than an object. Elias bent over it with the gravity of a man considering where the river goes under the town. \u201cI can stitch it,\u201d he said, almost sheepish, as if confessing to a spell learned in a different school. \u201cClay can be persuaded with little staples if you know how to apologize with metal.\u201d He fetched from the shed a cigar tin with a family history of screws and bent nails, and in its bottom he found the short, fat lengths of brass that had once married a garden urn back to itself. \u201cYou make holes like ears,\u201d he said, touching the clay not yet, \u201cand then you give it a reason to stay.\u201d He looked at her as if asking permission to hurt a thing in order to keep it, and she nodded, because she had already walked past that argument with her own mouth.\n\nThey set themselves on either side of the dish like parents doing the surgery fairest to be shared. He drilled with a hand drill that had belonged to a man dead long enough that any etiquette around borrowing his tools had become habit. The noise was small; the clay powdered and smelled like something dug up that had been waiting to be found. Ulriche held the bowl steady, feeling through her skin the stubbornness of fired earth resisting renegotiation. They put in the little staples, two-pronged, and bent them shut with the flat-nosed pliers that had known every species of fence. The bowl winced and then relaxed. \u201cShe will always remember,\u201d Elias murmured, the old pronoun he hadn\u2019t meant to use sneaking out anyhow, and Ulriche smiled because it was exactly the sentiment one might have about a jaw without a tooth. When they were done the bowl bore a line of stitches like a scar on a saint\u2019s relic, indecent and honorable at once. They set it down and filled it and watched a thin wet thread appear at the seam and make a small pilgrim\u2019s trail down, then hesitate and stop as if a decision had been made by a committee of water and brass. \u201cIt will leak on its own schedule,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cWe\u2019ll learn it,\u201d and he nodded, relieved to discover that some failures were simply new habits in good light.\n\nThe fox, which had lately become a punctuation more than a presence, began to leave its marks nearer to the kitchen door. Bettina found a rind of cheese on the step one morning with a bite taken out of it that would have shamed a human child, and she stood with her hands on her hips and declared\u2014 as if it surprised anyone\u2014 that no animal would be forgiven that considered the pantry its parish. \u201cHe has sense enough to pray where God hears him,\u201d she groused, and went inside to put wire on the bin that held the waste a fox would call groceries. Elias made a lid out of a piece of board that had once been a shelf for hymnals no one liked and a rock that had once been part of a wall that no longer remembered what it had held. \u201cHe can have the far lot,\u201d Bettina conceded, narrowed eyes pinned to the place where the path from wild to kitchen would be if animals believed in maps. \u201cHe cannot have the step.\u201d Rafe looked at the prints with the interest of a man who had not yet been tested by anything larger than a dog and said, thoughtfully, that sanctity might travel on small feet. Bettina flicked her dishcloth in a motion that could be translated as yes and no and then returned to her stew, which did not respect philosophy.\n\nOn a Tuesday evening in the library the children arrived with the crisp of cold in their hair and the dampness of their mittens making a daily river on the radiator. Rafe had them say the prayer and then, because he had discovered that any group of children would give you their attention if you gave them a secret, he told them that St. Blaise had once saved a boy from choking on a fishbone, which had nothing and everything to do with throat blessings. Mara\u2019s hand went up as if it were attached to a string only she could see. \u201cWhat about words,\u201d she asked, earnest in the way of girls whose mouths have already learned to run faster than their sense of what cannot be retrieved, \u201ccan they choke?\u201d Rafe opened his mouth, shut it, opened it again, and said, \u201cOnly if you swallow them when you mean to say them,\u201d and the girls smirked at one another and the boys filed the sentence away to bring up years later when some woman spoke and they preferred she didn\u2019t. Ulriche held her eyebrows in the position that said children were not to be given weapons disguised as advice and changed the subject to prophets with good hair and terrible habits.\n\nIt was later, as she was putting away catechisms and tucking the cedar wedges back in their tin like sleeping fish, that the small fire happened. Jory O\u2019Rourke, who had a pocket that loved matches and an attention that hated anything that lasted longer than his breath held, had been demonstrating to Benny Sanz the principle by which an empty matchbox, scrubbing itself on the tongue of the striker, could be made briefly brilliant and then turned ash without ever asking permission. The trick went on without adult notice until the box, tossed toward the wastebasket with the aim of a boy who has been praised for less, landed in paper that did not like boys. Elias, passing by the glass on his way to put away the broom he had made seem noble, saw the slick lift of flame like a fox tail and did not knock; he came through the door with his hand already set to take heat. Ulriche had a pail because she always had a pail when paper was in the room. They put the fire out with the humiliating efficiency most fires deserve, a dark smear left on the edge of a bin like the memory of too much enthusiasm. Rafe held Jory by the shoulder with that gentle, unshakeable hand he had learned from older men who had been obliged to be kind, and spoke to him about being entrusted with his own flint. \u201cFire wants work,\u201d he said, and Jory, who would be a man with a good or bad back depending on whether he was given something worth lifting soon enough, nodded with the sullen sincerity of the almost-repentant. Mara looked at the singe with the superiority of a poet who had not written about flames yet. Ulriche patted her pockets for the smell of what had almost happened, relieved to find only the old lives of cedar and ink.\n\nThe next morning she woke with her voice not where she habitually left it but down behind the left side of her throat like a coin that had rolled under a bed. It was not missing, just elsewhere, and when she tried at Lauds to fetch it, it came up reluctantly, as if testing whether the day was worth the climb. Agnes materialized in the sacristy like a useful superstition with a solution and thrust into Ulriche\u2019s hand two candles bound crosswise with a scrap of blue cotton that had once lined the baptismal basin. \u201cHold,\u201d she commanded, and for once Ulriche did exactly what she was told, pressed the wax to her neck in the traditional shape, offering her small inflammation to an old story. The warmth found its way in, refused to be pushed out by rules, and her skin briefly believed in everything. Rafe raised his hands over her in the general blessing with a humility that made the candles behave. \u201cBy the intercession of Saint Blaise, bishop and martyr,\u201d he said, the words good in his mouth, \u201cmay God deliver you from all ailments of the throat,\u201d and Ulriche felt the old faith travel like a shiver to the part of her that liked to sing at the wrong hour. Father Oliver, who was wheeled in to the chapel in a chair that had agreed not to squeak out of pity, held his own throat with exaggerated solemnity and winked at the smallest of the girls, who almost dropped a candle bowing in reply.\n\nAfterward, in the courtyard where the bowl wore its stitches like jewelry no one would ever buy for fear of flattery, Elias held his hand out without asking for hers and the candles returned themselves to him obediently because they understood what it meant to be held by a man who knew the burn of instruments and the absence created by a tooth. \u201cI have another present,\u201d he said, embarrassed by his impulse and bolstered by a success that had been measured in a dry library days ago. He reached into his coat and brought out a little roll of gauze tied with string. Inside, when she opened it at his nod, were four pieces of old spoon handle, sanded and glimmering, flat like tongues, notched at one end. \u201cTo lift pages,\u201d he explained, face reddening as though good words were blood and privacy was skin. \u201cWhen your fingers are damp. I saw the nurse use one on Oliver to hold his cheek and thought\u2014\u201d He did not finish because decency has its borders. Ulriche thought of her tooth under the rosemary and her wrists tied in winter to work that needed the exact pressure she had and felt, in her chest, something float that had been willing to sink. \u201cThey will be used,\u201d she said, and put one under her tongue briefly out of a superstition that would have scandalized a bishop.\n\nThe fox had taken to sitting very still in the late afternoons at the fence line as if committing to memory which households had balsamic vinegar and which homes only pretended to. Maribeth reported, in the tone of someone issuing a bulletin no authority would thank her for, that it had a white spot on its left hind foot like a coin of approval. Verna, who had decided the fox was a visitor from some Old Testament closed on a Thursday, insisted they should give it a name and then tried on three or four\u2014 Basil, Crispin, some obscure bishop whose sainthood had been achieved by survival rather than miracles\u2014 and gave up when none fit, calling it Fox as if that were honor enough. Bettina baited the rats with a grim affection that made Ulriche think of old aunts tying ugly bows. \u201cIf he stays at the fence,\u201d Bettina conceded like a woman releasing a captive idea in a meadow, \u201che may watch. If he comes to the step I will make a parable that ends unpretty.\u201d\n\nThe days stretched on. There were small works to be done, which is the proper way to carry sorrow. Ulriche oiled the hinges of cabinets that had complained twice and therefore had earned patience. She rethreaded the drawstring in a sack that had been sulking for months. She taught Mara the trick of holding a page down with the pad of her finger below the text instead of on it, and Mara nodded gravely and then, privately later, invented a way to do it with her sleeve that pleased her more. In the afternoons Rafe read from the Acts of the Apostles with a surprise that suggested he had not known how much was built on people making decisions in rooms with bad windows. Father Oliver slept. On Thursdays Elias went to the hospital and learned the sound of the elevators and the way the nurses\u2019 shoes spoke to tile and came back with his hands shoved in his pockets, which is how a man carries news he is not sure someone wants. Ulriche asked, when asking did not sound like a demand, whether Oliver had smiled, and sometimes the answer was yes and sometimes the answer was a silence accompanied by a look at an object in the room that did not belong and would have to be moved later.\n\nOn the day the beeswax was blessed and the boys learned what a thurible weighed full, Salem thawed and then reconsidered. The sidewalks glistened like plausible arguments and the roofs gave up their scabs with noisy regret. The bowl leaked gracefully, its small confession making a wet halo in the dust. Ulriche found herself humming again by accident, the sound a measured thing like a seam being set straight, and she checked herself only because Agnes popped her head out of the wardrobe like a jack-in-the-box that had read Holy Rules and shook it once, that small economical reprimand that was mostly an invitation to be stubborn. \u201cYou\u2019re not a kettle,\u201d Agnes scolded without words, and Ulriche, who had decided this year to answer less often the voices that could not be thanked, smiled and went on taking out of drawers the sticks of wax that would become the procession. She noticed she had started to prefer the honey-colored ones to the pure white, which might have the makings of a philosophy if anyone had time.\n\nShe took an hour toward evening and walked the far lot in a loop that had become a path only in her mind. The snow had settled into its own limits with the practical humility that earns respect. The elm flung its gray fingers. The fox\u2019s track stitched across and then stopped abruptly at the fence, which made her consider all the things that go under and all the things that jump and how rarely the two kinds of creatures envy one another. Elias was at the cold frames, lifting a lid with the guilty care of a man checking on a sleeping baby who is not his. \u201cI\u2019ve started basil too early,\u201d he admitted cheerfully, as if confessing to the weather would give him an indulgence. \u201cIt will sulk and then surprise me or it will just sulk.\u201d Ulriche bent and inhaled. The air under the glass was thick with the small audacity of green. \u201cWe\u2019re all too early in something,\u201d she said, and he looked as if she had spoken to him about a specific and named expansion of his heart, which was rude of her and also not.\n\nCandlemas itself had that right balance between circumstance and kindness. The candles shone without arrogance. The children, unpredictable in all seasons, were solemn as ships. Rafe lifted the bundle of throats and symbols high, his face briefly the face of a man whose life makes sense because he believed it could if he used proper words at proper moments. Father Oliver\u2019s eyes shone wet, whether from smoke or love or pain that had put on clean clothes for the day, and he held the ends of a ribbon that someone had tied around the prayerbook to make it look like a wrapped present. Ulriche sang in the small place where a woman may sing without becoming a sentence other people have to deal with, and her voice was the right size for her mouth again and not a size larger that would have tipped the day. Elias stood in the back, hat in hand, as if he had come to buy a loaf and decided it would be a poor exchange not to watch a mystery he had not ordered. When the blessing of throats came round to him he bent a little, awkward as a saint learning to sit in a new chair, and let the crossed candles dress his neck with a temporary gentleness. He did not look at Ulriche, which made it easier for her to watch him. She thought of the fox\u2019s tail and of the thread of water along the bowl\u2019s seam, of the thin coppery line of blood in her own mouth two weeks ago, of all the things that cut and are forgiven but never wholly forgotten, and found her throat given over to heat for a moment that no one would mark in the register.\n\nNews came down the wire, which had decided to be reliable that day, that a storm considered grand by people who named storms would work itself up the coast in two days\u2019 time. Bettina made lists that had more to do with the geography of a pantry than the psychology of fear. Heloise walked with her keys in hand, the way captains stroll the deck before a weather that pretends to be an agent. Verna lined the jars of honey up by height again, because order could be suggested to squalls if you were polite. Elias tied down what had the decency to be tied and spoke to the lids of the cold frames in the same tone he used to talk to young boys inclined to test the strength of their bones. Ulriche laid out rope in the hall and towels near thresholds and counted the buckets that had the sense not to leak. \u201cThere\u2019s a seam in the south roof over the schoolroom that translates to a scandal in the corner,\u201d she told Elias, and he nodded as if she had given him the diagnostic language a man prefers to a woman\u2019s sigh.\n\nBefore the weather arrived in its official capacity, there was a day of odd light, the sky as though rubbed with flour. Mara presented Ulriche with a new poem written in pencil that had bitten through. It concerned foxes and saints and a small bowl that thought itself the moon and behaved accordingly. Ulriche put a star sticker on her cuff even though the girls were too old for that kind of approval and watched Mara take the poem back and crease it carefully as if to encourage the words not to flee. Jory O\u2019Rourke brought her an apology in the form of three straightened nails. \u201cFrom my Da,\u201d he added, as if provenance mattered to guilt, and Ulriche took them in both hands as if they were eggs and said that the library liked contrition that could be used.\n\nThat evening the wind rehearsed, making the ash at the corner bow and then roll its shoulders as if warming up for a dance it both dreaded and treasured. Elias came to the library door and stood with his cap in his hand, which had become a way of saying: I am not here to take anything, only to report. \u201cI\u2019ve put the sand by the east steps,\u201d he said, \u201cand the shoveled paths will become lies in the next hour, but I\u2019m telling them the truth now while it matters.\u201d Ulriche nodded. \u201cThe bowl?\u201d she asked, because some priests ask after souls and some women ask after dishes, and both questions matter in their way. \u201cI set it under the bench,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will still catch. It has moved into a new office.\u201d He grinned quickly, his mouth making a shape that could be stored against a day when the sky was too strictly practical. \u201cIt will leak in the dark,\u201d she said, and he shrugged, the economy of a man who knows you can\u2019t keep everything covered. He left the doorway with the regret of someone who has learned how much thresholds like to keep.\n\nWhen the storm made its announcement, it did it with a suddenness that made the corners of the house look up. Snow came in sideways, not wishing to meet anyone\u2019s eyes. The old tree by the garden made a noise like an animal being persuaded to stand. The new deacon, who had been waiting to prove something to someone without spilling anything, put on boots that had learned the shapes of other men\u2019s feet and went to help Elias throw salt like a benediction at places where bodies would insist on being. Ulriche stayed near the library because if water came down again it would come down here and she had promised the books in some intimate grammar she did not quite know that she would be present next time catastrophe tried the latch. Agnes rustled in Rookery fashion in the wardrobe and had the good sense, for once, to select sentences that sounded like hooks and gave them to Ulriche to grab with her free hand. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the weather,\u201d Agnes reminded her, which is the sermon the devout need most, and Ulriche grinned in the dark and said aloud, to make a pact with whatever listening thing wanted to be fed, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nAt the worst of it the power went down and stayed there like a child under a table after a long run of being asked to apologize. The house made its own small noises. The candles did exactly what they had been told two days ago they would be asked to do. The girls pretended not to be frightened and then were not. Heloise walked through the refectory with a light held high and made of herself a moving chapel, and people cheered without raising their voices. Bettina produced soup in a defiance that may actually have held the building together by its smell. Elias came and went and appeared at one point in the library with a rake and his hair full of the kind of white that makes women adjust their tone. \u201cTrees down in the far lot,\u201d he said, as if reporting on a parishioner who had taken it into his head to go dramatic and then thought better of it. \u201cOne against the fence. The fox has retreated to story.\u201d Ulriche held the candle very still and passed him the matches and did not ask him to stay; she had learned at last the difference between requisitioning a body and making room for one.\n\nIn the morning there was the image of a world re-written for a day, all mistakes forgiven and all spelling altered. The library had not taken water. The bowl had done its under-bench duty and saved exactly the amount of melted edge that could remind a person that collecting anything is only a postponement. The cold frames had survived with the dignity of ships that reach port ungainly but upright. The elm had dropped two large limbs into the far lot like a lesson. Elias and Rafe went out with saws and a rope and the good manners of men who had learned to speak to weight, and Ulriche watched from the cloister as they worked, the one bending to the ground with the confidence of someone who could lean on it and be caught, the other learning to let his knees do that old practical prayer. The fox\u2019s track came, incredibly, under the fence and along the lee of the wall. It paused by the bench in a print that looked like punctuation and then went on. \u201cHe knows our habits,\u201d Maribeth whispered, delighted at the inappropriateness of the intimacy.\n\nLater there was the blessing of throats again because Heloise had discovered a law in her heart that repeated good medicine. The girls lined up and did not look at the boy whose fire had tried library, because this was mercy\u2019s day, not anybody\u2019s correction. Father Oliver, wrapped like a word not to be squandered, lifted his hand in a version of the old blessing that had the shape of his younger arm in it and the weight of his older lungs. He put the crossed candles to his own neck last as a man does not play favorites with his own body, and when it was done he waved a thin piece of wax at Ulriche and made his mouth at her as if he were telling her a joke about Romans he was too tired to speak. She came and took the stub and put it in her pocket and found there the old envelope in which a tooth had once ridden to the garden and smiled at the ridiculousness of a life heavy with small precise objects.\n\nThat evening, with everything fastened and the worst done, Ulriche went into the garden with her kettle for the sake of ceremony and cracked the thin new lid on the bowl that had been stitched. It held with its proper leak, making its little signature on the stone, a line like a vein. Elias came then to the other side and sat on the bench, his hands open on his knees, empty in the way that means they are ready and not famished. \u201cYou do that even when it will freeze again,\u201d he said, not a challenge, only a man asking to understand a liturgy that had begun before his hiring. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t kindness to water, it\u2019s a note to myself. There will always be something to pour into.\u201d He nodded, because now and then a sentence found him like a tool finds its own barn door. They sat until the small birds came and did their numbers and left, and then she stood and he did too, not at the same moment but as if a breath had gone between the two movements and left them improved.\n\nWhen she went inside Agnes was on the landing like a badger pretending to be a tea-kettle. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you are not the only librarian his hands have wanted to fix a thing for,\u201d she snapped, and then, almost tenderly, as if giving a child a coin for a fair, \u201cand also don\u2019t punish him for being new to something you think you invented.\u201d Ulriche, who had started this year to run out of patience for being scolded by her own undomesticated mind, laughed into the dim and went up to the library where the cedar wedges sat in their tin and the spoon-tongues lay like small promises. She took one and set it into a book that had closed itself obstinately all day and watched the page lift a fraction, an obedient pupil in a room where light knew where to sit. She hummed without permission and let the hum be a small weather none of the rules would notice.\n\nAfter Compline, when the house let itself whisper and the hall with the saints leant in to become a corridor of good gossip, Rafe stopped by the door and asked, in a tone that would not force any heart\u2019s hinges, if he might borrow a book on bees. \u201cNow?\u201d Ulriche asked, amused and warmed, and he grinned with that unconcealed hope young deacons have when they find a new set of nouns. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve promised to preach about wax as obedience and I need to be saved from my own metaphor.\u201d She handed him a slender volume that smelled like a summer that had been put to bed properly and he slipped it under his arm as if it were a small instrument whose case had been lost. \u201cYou\u2019re doing fine,\u201d she said, and he looked startled, laughed, shook his head at the boldness of a library pronouncing on a man, and then made her feel generous for thinking the compliment true.\n\nSnow gave up steadily, honest as a confession said to the right person. The roads darkened and then held. The fox became once again rumor with proof. Father Oliver learned to climb the altar steps with his hands around the rail and his breath placed upright in his chest like a chair set back into its corner. Bettina decided rosemary belonged in the bread and not only the lamb, a concession that made Ulriche unaccountably happy, as if the kitchen had acquiesced to a secret she had been keeping in plain sight. She buried two more small things under the green\u2014 a button from her cuff that had cracked like an old song and the matchbox Jory had given her in apology, empty now and therefore virtuous\u2014 and did not tell anyone about the little thicket of objects growing under that herb, because privacy has its own sacrament.\n\nIn March, the first day that was not spring but understood it, Mara burst into the library with hair almost too bright to be contained by any institution and announced in a whisper that tried to be a shout, \u201cThere are kits.\u201d She had the look of a woman thirty years hence telling her friend something she had learned too late to be useful and entirely in time to be interesting. \u201cBy the old elm,\u201d she added, \u201cthey are exactly small,\u201d and Ulriche bit her lip and put her hand longingly toward Elias\u2019s absence and then pulled it back and looked for Rafe, who could be trusted not to put the gratitude of a large man near a den. He came at once, because he had suspected all day that the world had set aside something for him to see if he had the grace not to turn it into an anecdote. They went out with their bodies held small and their eyes open as one opens a letter one has already written in a different life. By the root of the elm, in a fold the wind had not seen fit to rough up, three little foxes made themselves into exclamation points and then commas and then a single brief hyphen as their mother put her mouth on each head in turn without moving anything more than necessary. Ulriche felt a heat in the cup of her hand as if the sight had put something there she could not carry long, and she closed her fingers briefly, pressing the fiction into the truth, and breathed out without sound. Elias came up behind them later, from another path, moving in the way a man moves who knows now how not to be a threat even when his boots are proof of him. He stood at a decent distance and smiled once and then did not smile again because joy prefers fewer witnesses.\n\nThat night, because the day was not big enough for all of it, she wrote in her little book without crossing out: There are things we are allowed to see because we have learned how to hold our breath while looking. The bowl holds though it leaks. The rosemary keeps the small cemetery I make under it without asking questions. Elias\u2019s hands have become a way for me to understand how walls confess when they are asked to stand for others. Rafe has not offended any angels this week. Agnes is the noise a conscience makes when it is being useful. Oliver breathes like a road repaired at last, a little ugly and exactly right. When she raised her head, the lamp had made a thin frost of light on the window that could have been mistaken for a map. She did not draw a line on it with her finger the way she would have when she was twelve. She folded her hands instead, not like a saint but like a librarian closing for the night. Outside, the fox crossed where it preferred, and the bowl, stiched and good, wore its wet aureole like a halo caught doing something ordinary.Chapter Ten\n\nAsh came down into the house like a remembered recipe, simple and unforgiving, and Rafe learned the weight of a thumb full of soot as it met the foreheads of girls who had been practicing solemn for this exact ten seconds all morning. The words were the same as they had been when she was a child and her father\u2019s hand had smelled faintly of mint and his box of powders while he traced dust on her brow and made it significant; dust to dust, as if the sentence had the good sense to return to the word it began with. Father Oliver pronounced the phrase from his chair with a tolerance for both ceremony and lungs that made Ulriche proud of his stubbornness and ashamed of her own impatience; he made the word dust sound like a friend returning in good order from a long road with the boots taken off at last.\n\nIn the library the ash left its own arguments on the windowsills where fingers had leaned, thin prints like signatures written by a creature that preferred to be everywhere and nowhere. Ulriche wiped them with a cloth dampened with vinegar and thought, not for the first time, that there are substances that only agree to be removed when you talk to them in their mother-tongue. Rafe came in later to count the catechisms as if numbers could be persuaded to teach themselves to behave, and he asked her, with the caution of a man newly in love with metaphors and already half-afraid of them, whether it was wrong to find comfort in a season that everyone else described as deprivation. \u201cComfort is just the absence of flinching,\u201d she said, and he nodded as if he had been given permission to treat his body like a good neighbor whose name he had finally remembered.\n\nThe fox, which had become plural and then very precisely three, learned the hours when the garden belonged to its kind of hunger. To watch them was to accept that some goodness arrives before it has earned its place; the kits tumbled with the idiotic courage of small things who haven\u2019t met the first wall that will tell them the height of their own legs. Maribeth assigned them names privately and then forgot two on purpose, because to name is to claim, and some creatures belong more strongly to the mouth that calls them Fox than to any smaller name that fits a single head. Bettina, who had made peace with a wider category of disasters than foxes, stacked the bin-lid with the finality of a decree and made up with her clatter for the tenderness she insisted she did not keep in a cupboard.\n\nElias\u2019s whistle, broken and then repaired like a barn hinge, returned without apology, ordinary enough to be unnoticeable by anyone not already listening for it. He had given up looking through the glass for the foxes when he was with Ulriche, perhaps out of a suspicion that their persistence belonged to a world he should not be congratulated for, and instead he made a habit of speaking into her threshold. \u201cThe frames sweat,\u201d he reported one morning, a sentence that could have been a moral in another book. \u201cThe basil sulks and then thinks better,\u201d he added, and she nodded as if he had told her a story about a child who was learning to apologize first and then not at all without forgetting the trick.\n\nOnce, between Vespers and Compline, when the day had taken to putting itself away and forgot where it had laid its own edges, Sister Agnes caught Ulriche by the arm with the old good pinch of women who have been given authority only in fingers and insisted on using it. \u201cYour throat is better and your voice believes you again; do not use that as license to preach to yourself,\u201d she scolded, and then, because she had come through enough winters to suspect mercy when it stood close and pretended to be pushing, she kissed Ulriche\u2019s cheek as if marking her for a kindness she would later deny had to be planned. Ulriche laughed and then went straight to the library and placed her hand on the row of bird books because the plates still made her breath go out of her with the same involuntary fondness she would have afforded a child caught standing on tiptoe with a jar of marmalade.\n\nThe bowl, neatly stitched and vain of it, had found a schedule no one else had agreed to but that everyone obeyed out of a recognition that certain leaks are the world announcing its continued effort rather than its collapse. Every morning she broke its thin habit and set the shards aside like good shards, not to be sentimental about but to take pleasure in as the proper result of a day intersecting itself. Sometimes the water did not show up in its chosen halo for an hour and then appeared all at once as if someone had removed a finger from the hole in the world, and once a robin attempted to bathe in that damp signature and then reconsidered the proprieties of it and went to the rain-barrel where the water forgot itself more easily.\n\nThe first heavy rain came the way new grief does, indelicate and loud, a thing that keeps you from your tasks rather than a thing you take with you while doing them. The far lot filled with honest puddles that held sky long enough to make the sky doubt its own sincerity. One of the fox kits discovered water by falling into it and then learned balance by getting out with a dignity that would have been comic if anyone had dared laugh in front of a creature old enough to be embarrassed. Mara wrote a poem about it with a line that made Ulriche stare at the floor so she wouldn\u2019t have to look generous back at the child, \u201cWe are all mostly puddles with a fox deciding to learn us.\u201d She stuck a star to the inside of her own cuff to remind herself that Mara\u2019s line had been properly noticed and then forgot about the sticker until Bettina found it in the wash and gave it back to her on the end of a spoon like a relic.\n\nOn a Friday when the wind put its elbows on the sill and invited all talk to be brief, the diocese sent three men who wore their clothes like letters of introduction. They came to look at the roof and to look at the books and to look at the room where the roof and the books and the women had been living together in what could be called a state or a sacrament depending on whether you liked the smell of old paper. Heloise stood with her keys held low, pointing toward the floor like a promise and a threat, and gave them names of boards and dates of repairs and the honest arithmetic of costs that refuse to become smaller when you write them in red pencil. The youngest of the men asked Rafe if the library ever had visiting hours for donors, and Rafe said, in his gentlest considered voice, that the poor were always visiting and the books liked them, and the man wrote something and then crossed it out because there are remarks that you cannot put in minutes without discovering you have lied.\n\nElias came in by accident then and became immediately the sort of problem men like to solve with other men\u2014 a worker without formal affiliation, a pair of hands that could be priced if one insisted. One of the suits asked him whether the frames would last, and Elias said, \u201cThrough a truth-teller of a frost? Yes. Through a liar? No,\u201d and the man laughed as if he had been made to, which is a kind of social success but not a moral one. When they left, Heloise sat down on the second step because it was hers and rubbed her hands on the knees of her habit as if, by friction alone, she might create enough heat to burn the paper with the sums on it. \u201cWe will need a fair,\u201d she told Ulriche, which is how women have been saving things for centuries without getting credit, and Ulriche nodded and began to write a list in her mind of which cupboards could bear being asked and which cupboards would have to be flattered into compliance.\n\nFair preparations existed at exactly the point where holiness and capitalism cross the street and pretend not to know each other. Bettina took butter out of the future and put it into the present with a competence that impressed even the mice. Verna invented a cordial from rosemary and lemons that tasted like something you would be told in a confessional and then told again at a kitchen table when the company was chosen correctly. Maribeth rigged a fishing game with magnets that made the boys believe briefly in machinery again. Rafe, who could be useful if you handed him a purpose with handles, built a blessing booth with a curtain and a box for prayers the way a man builds a cradle who has known children but not the exact one he is trying to convince. Ulriche organized books into stacks that would forgive being sold. She made a table of treasures without covers, brought back from near-drowning and now proud of their new, softened shapes, and propped them open with Elias\u2019s spoon-tongues so their bravery could be recognized.\n\nThe fair day arrived full of weather with both opinions and mercy. Heloise stood at the gate with a purse like a principality and greeted people who had grown up and then softened; everyone in town comes to a convent fair not for bargains but to be forgiven discreetly for having asked what things cost in other rooms. Children were turned loose like birds with names pinned to their jackets in case a storm took them. Sister Agnes ran the white-elephant table with a cruelty that saved people from themselves; she would put her hand on an object and say no, not for you, and then, after a pause long enough to teach a lesson, yes, perhaps only for today. Rafe blessed the rosemary bundles so many times that the plant began to get ideas about its vocation, and Bettina sold bread that cracked with its own authority.\n\nElias made himself smaller than he was in the way men do when they suspect the shape of their usefulness might embarrass anyone with a hat. He had built a stand out of old doors for Ulriche\u2019s mending demonstration and stood in the shade of it pretending he had other errands. People came with their old books like children with knees to be bandaged and stood quietly while Ulriche explained in a voice that had been sized correctly by Candlemas how to lift a page that wanted to cling and how to let paper breathe without shafts of showmanship. She used the cedar wedges and the spoon handles and the tin of paper like a magician who disliked applause. Once, when her thread tangled itself into an opinionated knot, Elias reached in from the edge and offered the end back to her without their fingers meeting, and she felt the relief along the length of her arms as if someone had loosened the laces of a dress that had been behaving.\n\nIn the afternoon there was a moment when music arrived without warning. Mara\u2019s uncle brought a fiddle and tuned it with the authority of someone who has lived long under trees, and the sound made the air remember what it had been doing before there were roofs. Men clapped in that old, absent-minded way good men have when their hands are called upon without sin. The fox made a brief row of prints at the far edge of the gravel, which everyone pretended not to notice except for Maribeth, who cried in the private, efficient way of a woman who has practiced and hates herself for it. Father Oliver sat in a chair near the bee-loud corner and let sound find him. When the tune turned into a jig by accident, he laughed once, and it startled a few people who hadn\u2019t remembered he could, which was worth the price of all the lemons.\n\nToward the end of the day, just when the sugar was deciding it had had enough of being obedient, a boy\u2019s shout cut a piece out of the afternoon. Jory O\u2019Rourke, with his pockets full of nails turned respectable by the fair, came running as if he had caught fire again. \u201cThe kit,\u201d he said, keeping his story wound tight by fear, \u201cfell\u2014 back by the well\u2014 between the stones\u2014 he\u2019s wedged,\u201d and the phrase flared out, a panic named in a way that made men turn toward shovels in their minds. Elias looked once at Ulriche and then away and moved with that new good pace of his, the one that did not involve speed but always arrived when it should. Rafe, to his credit, did not volunteer to take charge but followed, pulling aside two boys by their sleeves with that gentle nonnegotiable force good deacons learn from old women.\n\nThe well at the far edge of the lot had been retired with dignity years before and given a flat stone as a lid because the desire to fall is a human one and the convent had no need of extra metaphors. But the fox had no respect for human safety beyond what his ribs had taught him, and a space no wider than a plate had offered its bad invitation. The kit sat down in darkness and decided to wait, which is a strategy adopted by creatures with better teeth than humans. They could hear the small, unscandalized sound it made, as if it were not in trouble but merely interrupted. Elias lay flat on the ground without confessing to his back and slid his hand between the stones until his fingers were a different color, searching with the coward-courage of a man who will not let his grip hurt. The kit\u2019s fur met him like a sentence, and he closed his hand just enough to find the scruff that mothers use. He looked at Rafe, who had the good sense to be looking at the ground and not at Ulriche, and said, low, \u201cPush the top stone up a prayer,\u201d which is a unit of effort known in certain churches and gardens. Rafe leaned his weight, not with the vanity of a lifter but with the grammar of a man acquainted with levers, and the stone allowed a finger\u2019s width to become a thumb\u2019s.\n\nUlriche put both hands on the edge to hold the afternoon still. She said nothing because words are size-specific and this moment had already assigned itself adjectives. The kit passed up through air like a pun, silly and perfectly placed. It shot out onto the grass with embarrassment and insult in its small body and then, because no one had laughed, paused and turned, put its nose on Elias\u2019s thumb for the briefest learned courtesy, and was gone in a diminuendo of legs. Bettina would later claim to have seen the mother nod. Rafe crossed himself with the gesture of a man who has found the limit of his willingness to find God in everything and would like, for one evening, to be relieved of the obligation.\n\nAfter, when the tables were put back into versions of themselves and the jars counted and the coins scraped into Heloise\u2019s principality, Ulriche sat on the bench by the bowl as a series of small operations settled in her mind into the shape of a day. Elias stood near and counted his breathing as if it needed to be told that it was forgiven for being fast. \u201cI have learned how to remove a thing from a small dark,\u201d he said finally, not to be praised but because he needed to hear it once in a room that didn\u2019t echo. \u201cThat\u2019s the trick of this house,\u201d she said, and could not help the laugh that rose like a pan boiling over, \u201cthough we tend to throw in more candles and fewer foxes.\u201d\n\nThe ledger next day proved the town could be made to love what it pretended not to notice. There was enough for the roof to be mended and for the library to have a new gutter that would make old rain feel valued. Heloise put her hand on the paper the way a woman puts her hand on a sleeping child\u2019s chest to be sure of its argument and let her shoulder drop a fraction. She came to Ulriche with that rare, maddening kindness that made Ulriche feel she had not earned anything and said, very plain, \u201cYou will go to the city with Rafe on Thursday and fetch the used shelves from the parish of St. Constance; theirs have been given money and ours will be given wood, which is the better arrangement if you ask anyone sensible.\u201d Ulriche blinked. She had not driven, would not drive, and the last time she had sat in a car with a man she was still peeling meaning off the sides of it. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will bring shelves.\u201d Heloise nodded as if that had been the sentence the day had been waiting for and added, as if she had been forced by some ancient rule to include a thorn, \u201cAnd Sister Agnes will go with you,\u201d which made Ulriche both safer and more anxious in the way an extra blanket does.\n\nThe trip to the city happened under a sky that had learned how to be polite again. Rafe was better at driving than at most other things and worse than he thought at saving the sighs of the engine from embarrassing themselves. Agnes sat in the back as if she were the queen of an empire that had decided to travel incognito and made small noises at corners as if to signal that the angle of turning had offended a minor saint. Ulriche watched the hedges and did not look for foxes because there are some creatures who belong to the vocabulary of a particular street. Rafe talked in little folded packets about how the shelves would improve the library\u2019s lines and how the parish of St. Constance had once mounted a puppet show for Epiphany that had made three bishops write letters and two old women reconcile, and Ulriche let his words ride beside the car like a proper accessory.\n\nAt St. Constance a man with a waistcoat that had survived two political parties met them and showed the shelves as if they were paintings. They were dark with varnish that had learned its own opinions and they smelled of rooms where confession had been brandied into something permissible. Ulriche touched the wood and felt under her fingers the soft depression where other fingers had pulled books down and set them back and pulled them again. Rafe and the waistcoat man discussed bracing and the traveling of weight over years. Agnes inspected a dowel with an expression a dean might have worn at a composition full of passive voice and then, grudgingly courteous to inanimate improvements, allowed the men to lift. Ulriche stood aside where she could carry ends and watch knuckles without acquiring any, and for the first time in days she felt a rest in her chest as if her ribs had been assured they were doing exactly what they ought.\n\nThey loaded the shelves into the convent\u2019s truck and tied them down the way one ties promises one intends to keep even if one suspects one has exaggerated. On the way back, the city having done its work of reminding them that a convent is a way and not a place, Rafe took the lower road by the river because Agnes had once said out loud that the upper road made her think the sky had leaned too close and he had taken her at her word and built a route of it. As they passed the park where the squirrel had reorganized Elias, Ulriche looked deliberately at one bench and then at another like a woman learning to discard a superstition by keeping a ritual. There were no squirrels visible, only a man asleep under an important newspaper and a woman standing as if she had the sun on an invisible leash, and Ulriche felt both alarmed and comforted by the normalcy of it.\n\nThey arrived as the light practiced for evening. Elias was in the yard with his sleeves rolled because sleeves should be rolled whenever anyone with a conscience handles a shelf. He took the end of the first tall section from Rafe with that economical respect men learn when they have been warned by their backs, and they walked it in together like a guest whose temper was known. Ulriche went ahead to clear the space where the shelves would live and, for a moment, the room appeared to her as a body arranged with its own good sense: a spine here, a lung there, a long arm reaching from the old parish to this one, placing along the way every book that had forgiven water and boys and the odd rat. She stopped for breath not because she needed it but because the sight had the courtesy to allow her a pause.\n\nThat night, as the bowls of soup told their steaming stories and the girls argued quietly about whether saints had preferred desserts, Father Oliver asked to be brought to the library. He had not asked for anything grand in weeks and therefore had earned a derrick of attention to lift a smaller wish. They rolled him between the aisles like a ship that had learned to recognize its harbor by the smell more than the shape, and he put his hand on the new shelf and patted it twice as if to teach it the rhythm of his heart. \u201cThey will forgive our backs,\u201d he murmured, as if the wood were a thing that could be persuaded to make moral concessions, and Ulriche thought, with the suddenness of a woman corrected gently by a pleasant truth, that he was not talking about lumber at all.\n\nLent lengthened and then began to come to its senses. The girls learned a hymn they disliked in a key that made Sister Verna look pious by accident, and Rafe discovered a penitent who wanted to confess that he had, for years, told people he liked marmalade when in fact he did not. Bettina made soup out of nothing and then again the next day out of less than nothing and refused to be thanked in a tone that was obviously a request to be thanked properly later. The fox kits grew into their ears and then into their feet, and once Ulriche caught one sitting like an old general in the spot of sun where the fence lost interest and forgot its point, its head tilted as if it were considering writing a letter to the editor.\n\nA letter came with the seal that made Heloise\u2019s mouth set to a practical grimace. It announced a visit from the bishop, who was fond of speaking as if he were at the beginning of time and time had just whispered its name to him. He would come the week after Easter, though the letter pretended it was a surprise to everyone, and he would say some words and eat some bread and count the chairs with his eyes without appearing to. Rafe, who had not met a bishop who did not smell faintly of something unrepeatable, practiced not saying what he thought already with some grace. Agnes brought out a tablecloth from a century when tablecloths had corners that made their own arguments and declared that she would not be ironing for any man who had not learned to bend his own back. Ulriche thought of the bowl and of the repairs no one but water would care about and decided to brush the invisible dirt off the lip of the world.\n\nOn a day when the sky had finally decided to turn white into blue without needing an audience, Maribeth came in to the library with a stack of papers and the look of a woman who once thought she had lost time and then found it under the bed. \u201cYou asked for names of the emigrant girls that first year,\u201d she said, laying down the stack as if the paper were hot on the underside. \u201cI found them in an old ledger that refused to admit it was a ledger and pretended to be a grocery list for the souls of children.\u201d Ulriche picked up the first page and felt her stomach move in that sober happy way it had when a piece of something larger turned in its sleep and showed its back. Names ran down the paper like a litany taught by someone who didn\u2019t know he was teaching and therefore had the good luck of sincerity. The girls had been Agnes then, and Mary, and Flor, and Vita, and a single Carmen who had had the temerity to insist on remaining Carmen in a town that did not expect such an honor. Ulriche ran her finger under the list as if under a seam and breathed in, gently, because paper had decided today to hold more than ink.\n\nIn the evening, after the girls had been taught not to put their thumbs in the wax by letting them put their thumbs in the wax, Ulriche went out to the rosemary and knelt with her small spade. The ground had the give of a body that had decided to forgive you quietly. She planted three little S of something Elias had given her without ceremony\u2014 sage, the boys making their jokes the way sputtering lamps do, and then being shushed. Under the rosemary lived the tooth and the button and the matchbox and a little pile of what, by now, had become more than a list and less than a story. She smoothed the earth and told it, in a voice she had learned from women who reassure children without making them stupid, that it would be asked again and it would answer again and regrettably that was life.\n\nElias came through the arch with the same pace he had learned for bad news and then had wisely kept for good. He did not sit. He did not stand too close. He held out a paper with the sort of modest pride a man reserves for something that cannot be confused with strength. \u201cI have a license,\u201d he said. He meant the hospital\u2019s permission to drive their old van for errands that had their own timelines, the document with dates and an officious signature and a weight out of proportion to its rectangle. He had returned to the road, in daylight and on purpose and only when required, and he had not hit anything that had not deserved it. Ulriche took the paper and did not read it, because the content was obvious and the formality a kindness to be let alone. \u201cYou kept your slow,\u201d she said, and he nodded and then, with a bravery so embarrassed she loved him for it beyond her rights, said, \u201cAnd I kept my fox.\u201d\n\nHoly Week unrolled like a cloth that had seen too much. There were practices and basins and the old embarrassed intimacy of men washing men\u2019s feet and pretending to speak solely to God. Rafe preached a short sermon with the long point that pain arrives dressed like work and leaves dressed like rest. Father Oliver bit his lip at a verse and then let it go like a man who knows what he can carry and what he must pass to smaller, steadier hands. The children decided that Judas must have been tired, which is a dangerous thought to give children because they will take it with them into rooms where it will be mistaken for permission. Ulriche sang where she was asked and kept the extra verses folded in her throat for later in case someone with keys called for them.\n\nOn Easter morning the yard did not spring, it permitted. The bowl held. The fox kits sat like commas, necessary and briefly decorative, and then were called by their mother into the paragraph. The basil, long offended, consented to become leaves. Bettina made eggs scrumbled into a promise without the show of it. Heloise smiled the smallest smile anyone had seen on her face and let it stay there for the length of an Our Father. Rafe\u2019s alleluias came round and did not require defense. Elias stood beyond the door and turned his hat in his hands and then did not come in and then did, which is probably the way the door would prefer it always.\n\nIn the afternoon, when the children were left off to run and the girls, who were not children but were not yet anything else, went to write letters with words they could not entirely be expected to mean, Ulriche took down a book on saints who had made gardens and found herself surprised by the number of men who had needed to talk to cabbages. She leafed through, the old gleaned Latin buzzing gently like a hive, and thought, with the relief of a person who has found a river running under a city, that maybe she was not inventing as much as she feared. Agnes came and stood in the doorway as if she might be a sermon and then was simply a woman with bad knees. \u201cYou will let him carry for you when the shelf is too high,\u201d she said, and then, before Ulriche could make either of the three errors available to her, added, \u201cand you will carry what is yours when he is tired. There are no medals for the exact proportion. I have looked.\u201d\n\nThe bishop arrived as announced; there are men who are their announcements. He had a pleasant, tidy smile he thought would not be held against him and a ring that drew the attention of even the children who had been told jewelry was a vanity and then given holy cards with gold on them. He said sensible things, which is an underrated talent in men with hats, and did not inspect the pantry. He praised the library and said the word resilience as if it had been taught to him by people he now intended to honor retroactively. He noticed the stitch in the bowl without assuming it was a metaphor, which almost made Ulriche forgive him for being the sort of man whose sentences rearranged money.\n\nWhen he was gone and had taken with him the small eddy of criticism that follows men who have been called father by very many, the house went back to its size. Elias brought a handful of seeds he had carried in his pocket so long they smelled like the inside of his coat and said, in the tone of a question that is not a request, \u201cBeans?\u201d and Ulriche looked at his hands and at the grounds and at the year and nodded. They planted in a thin line that looked, from the window, like a margin note, and when they were done they watered with the delicacy of friends who have been invited to put their hands on a sleeping baby\u2019s head. The fox watched from the fence as if it were considering the agricultural policies of a new administration. The bowl leaked its signature in the same place as always.\n\nThat night, when the bell made its last careful announcement and the girls had been counted and the soup put not away but into another day, Ulriche wrote in her small book without crossing out: It is possible to love like a bowl loves, with a crack and a schedule and no apology. It is possible to stand at the lip of a well and learn what belongs to the dark and what can be lifted; it is possible to let a man\u2019s hand hold the scruff of a day and not insist on the ceremony of tears. It is possible that obedience, properly understood, is a knot tied in wind, not for tying people but for keeping blankets on them in a certain draft. She blew on the page as if the words were varnish and would harden usefully and then closed the book on her palm as if her hand were a page. Outside, the kits argued briefly that the moon had been made selfish and the mother answered them without moving more than her tail, which calmed the whole lot of them in the only way that ever works. The rosemary kept its small cemetery without comment and the beans slept with the proper arrogance of things that know themselves to be food and flowers both, depending on the hand.",

                              "content": "The morning bells at Saint Apollonia of the Veil were tuned to the fog. There was a softness to their ringing that made the air itself seem woolen, like a shawl pulled over the town of Salem and its mounded roofs and sleeping gutters. Ulriche stood beneath the cloister arch as their notes braided into one another and turned a moment into something she could step through. Autumn had begun to salt the trees in the courtyard with yellow and rust; the gravel gave back the faintest sigh whenever she turned her foot.\n\nA squirrel sat on the rain barrel, tail furred up like a question mark. It was not yet afraid of her, and she felt grateful, foolishly, to be trusted by something quick. \u201cYou\u2019re always up early,\u201d she told it, and the squirrel cocked its head as if considering whether morning talk from a woman in a black veil was allowed in the kingdom of leaves. A few crumbs were in her pocket from a loaf Sister Agnes had cut badly and abandoned on the board. She scattered them, and the squirrel skittered down, nails clicking lightly, like pins shaken in a tin.\n\n\u201cBread for animals,\u201d said Sister Agnes, appearing at Ulriche\u2019s left shoulder without noise. \u201cBread isn\u2019t ours to spare.\u201d\n\n\u201cBread is God\u2019s,\u201d Ulriche murmured, surprised at herself for saying it aloud. She glanced sideways and saw only the wall, whitewashed, pocked with small shadows that looked like thumbprints. Sister Agnes had already gone or had never been there or had spoken without being seen. It happened like that, now and then. She made a note to ask Father Oliver if there was a rule about speaking to squirrels at dawn or arguing about bread with a woman who wore her rosary too tight.\n\nShe steadied her basket under the crook of her arm and stepped into the garden beds. The earth had the warmth of someone recently risen. A gardener was working the far row, a man so much part of the garden that she could imagine he had put his hand in loam and it had raised him up like a seed. His back was to her. The sun, such as it was, threw a pale loop around him: a halo put on wrong, from behind, too low. When he straightened and turned, she knew him because she had been told about him, the new man the parish had hired while Brother Patric\u2019s lungs healed. His name was Elias Hart.\n\nHe took off his cap in the presence of any nun, not just the prioress. \u201cSister,\u201d he said, a greeting and a question.\n\n\u201cUlriche,\u201d she said, and then, realizing that this was a fact too large to carry on the tip of politeness, added, \u201cSister Ulriche. The library.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe library,\u201d he echoed, as if it were a location on a map not often visited. A smile. He was younger than she\u2019d expected, older than she would have wanted someone else to be. The lines around his mouth were the sort plowed by weather rather than grief. \u201cMother Heloise said you\u2019d come for rosemary. The kitchen asked for it, and I am slowly learning how much rosemary is too much. I was told you would know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey tell you correct things sometimes,\u201d Ulriche said. Her words came out a little crooked; she felt the unkind heat of it in her face and turned to the herb bed, which had gotten ambitious and sent up its own ideas of where it belonged. She tore off a length, then another, then forced herself to stop, though the tearing was a small sickness and cure both. \u201cRosemary likes the dry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dry,\u201d he repeated, and she knew he was not mockingly echoing her but rather setting her advice behind a door in his head where he could find it later. She wanted to be that door, or the cupboard built into the wall beside it, holding jars she had labeled in her neatest hand.\n\n\u201cElias,\u201d said a voice, something like wind caught in the keyhole. It was Sister Verna; it was also the sound of his name leaving Ulriche\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d He looked at her with a readiness that startled her, like someone called out of a lake who has no time to towel off.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d She pushed the rosemary into her basket and found a sprig stuck to the cuff of her sleeve. She did not remove it, because it seemed happier there, like an ornament from a childish festival.\n\n\u201cBrother Flint says the compost will heat too hot if you keep turning it,\u201d Elias said, gentle, as though continuing a discussion that had wandered off to find its dog. \u201cBut the rats\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no Brother Flint,\u201d Ulriche said. It came out too quick. He blinked, then nodded, deferential, as if he had meant something else and had chosen the wrong word entirely. She felt the heaviness of her veil against her ear and heard the small friction of cloth. \u201cThere is,\u201d she amended, adjusting the world with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cHe comes Tuesdays and clacks his teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen: he says so. But I don\u2019t like the rat\u2019s grin. I will turn it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn the rats,\u201d she said before she could stop herself. The oddness made him laugh, a low sound that brought to mind the bruised blue of plums set out to dry on a sill. He was a man who laughed rarely, or at least a man who laughed in places where it echoed quietly and no harm could be done by it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the book sister,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBooks grow best in dry air,\u201d he said. \u201cLike rosemary. I am trying to learn the habits of everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything has too many habits,\u201d Ulriche said. He looked at her a little longer than necessary, and she frowned at her own complicity in this; she was not a person who invited long looks; she was meant to be a dark door that swung outward when called upon and closed again neatly, not creaking, not stuck. But not everything she was meant to be was what she was.\n\nAfter Prime she went to the library, which was both older and younger than her, older because of the fat-ankled volumes that had and continued to believe they had saved more than one life, younger because the stacks were new and smelled like pine would smell if pine were patient. She touched the covers as one might touch a railing. It steadied her. She took a small notebook out of her sleeve and turned to the middle, where weeks ago she had written:\n\nElias Hart has a jaw like the edge of a pew. Do not write this. Do not think this. Do not write that you should not think this.\n\nShe laughed at herself and then crossed it out lightly, so that if she needed to read it again she could. There were layers of ink in all the margins, like a palimpsest written by a child learning to lie.\n\nSister Maribeth drifted in and sat down without comment at the far table. She was needle-limbed, might have been moth-born. She always had lint in her hair. \u201cWhat did Agnes say?\u201d she asked, not looking up from the pile of catalog cards she had appointed herself to overlap like shingles.\n\n\u201cWhich Agnes?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly the one,\u201d Maribeth said. \u201cThere\u2019s only the one Agnes on mornings. Evenings it\u2019s different.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me not to feed the squirrels,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a sin to be so strict.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe puts out a bowl,\u201d Maribeth murmured. \u201cElias. A bowl of water. For small mouths.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does?\u201d The thought of his hands at the base of a bowl, setting it down with the attentive caution reserved for breakable things, made something in Ulriche go light, a loosening as of something long screwed in being gently backed out. \u201cDid you talk to him?\u201d\n\nMaribeth shook her head. \u201cNo. I listen. He whistles but only when he doesn\u2019t notice it; that\u2019s how he startsle-startles himself. There is a way men whistle when they are trying not to speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are always hearing things,\u201d Ulriche said.\n\n\u201cYou can hear them too,\u201d Maribeth said, and before Ulriche could ask whether she meant whistling or something else entirely, the bell for Terce blew another piece of morning into her hands. She wrapped it around herself and went to the chapel.\n\nIn the chapel there were twelve candles and a thirteenth left unlit for the thing no one could name in public. The floor was slate and sucked the warmth out of her knees as she knelt. The prayers slid over the teeth of the hours the way thread sometimes catches and then pulls tight and flush, a seam flat enough to forget. Next to her, Sister Verna\u2019s voice climbed and then fell as if the words were a hill made just for the soles of her.\n\n\u201cUlriche,\u201d said Father Oliver afterward, catching her shoulder near the sacristy. His hand was dry. He had smoothed his hair with something that made it lie down like obedient grass. \u201cYou were humming in the fourth antiphon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI apologize,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cI thought it was only inside.\u201d She had been humming; she knew it; she had heard the hum travel around her mouth and settle in the back of her teeth. It had been a low, sap-green sound that reminded her of everything that grew without asking permission.\n\n\u201cIt is no sin to hum,\u201d Father Oliver said, then added, his voice gentling in a way that made her wish she could like him: \u201cWhat is caught in you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing. A burr,\u201d she said. \u201cI will take it off on the porch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gardener,\u201d he said, low.\n\n\u201cThe rosemary,\u201d she corrected.\n\n\u201cYou can name it whatever makes it bearable for your head.\u201d He looked at her, and for a heart\u2019s beat his pupils widened and then tightened again, a change any bird might have thought meant predator and flight. \u201cBe careful, Ulriche.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am careful,\u201d she said, softly furious with a person who was either himself or a shape made to be stern so she would have a wall to push against. \u201cWe only have this life to be careful in. I do it as if it mattered.\u201d\n\nHe smiled too sadly for the moment and let her go. On her way out she touched the stone basin filled with water and saw, out of the corner of her eye, a face that was and wasn\u2019t hers squinting back. The water jittered; she was too warm; her skin was doing the weather\u2019s work.\n\nAfternoons in autumn were the library\u2019s best months. The boys from the parish school came in to return the novels they had pretended to read and to ask her for more like those, with swords and storms and improbable ghosts. There was a girl with hair exactly the color of walnut skins, Mara, who tugged at Ulriche\u2019s sleeve to ask for poetry about horses that didn\u2019t die on the last page. \u201cThey always die. I think poets hate horses,\u201d Mara said solemnly. \u201cBut I like the words how they get tossed like oats.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake this,\u201d Ulriche said, and gave her something without horses at all, because that was the trick you learned with children. Mara smiled and made the book disappear under her sweater the same way the squirrels did with nuts, with a yank and a twitch.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give her Dickinson,\u201d Sister Agnes whispered behind her ear, and then a passage of silence grazed her neck, and Ulriche again was alone with the sudden heaviness of her own body. It didn\u2019t matter what anyone said about ghosts. A convent made them whether or not there was anyone dead nearby to have been them first.\n\nElias came with the rosemary before Vespers. He was soaked to the knees from pounding the hose, the grass blistered his shins in a green rash, and he had dirt in both eyebrows as if he had been thinking too close to the ground. \u201cEnough?\u201d he asked, holding out a bundle tied with blue string, absurdly pretty for something rough that wanted to be crushed.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d she said. Their fingers brushed when she took it. It was not the first time a man\u2019s hand had touched her hand; that would have been theatrical, a pious lie. But it was the first time in years that the hand felt like a sentence she wanted to finish, not a period pressed in with a blunt pen.\n\nHe cleared his throat. \u201cThe prioress said to carry it to the kitchen, but I\u2019m likely to go lost in those halls.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is always sending you places you haven\u2019t walked,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cCome with me then.\u201d It was too forward, she knew, but an extra step had already been taken in the garden this morning when the air made a corridor that ended here.\n\nThey went through the hall of saints a mason had tried to carve in a hurry. The faces were too similar, all with mild mouths as though they had been told a joke they would understand after they died. \u201cThey watch,\u201d Elias said, sympathetic to their bland endurance.\n\n\u201cThey would look different if he\u2019d had more time,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cAs if time is the only ingredient in making someone less like their neighbor.\u201d She wished to unsay it; she was too sharp sometimes, and the blade shone where everyone could see. But Elias nodded, as if he had known many men who had had too little time and therefore too many similar faces.\n\nIn the kitchen, the smell of carrot tops and iron and hot dishwater met them like a family. Sister Bettina took the rosemary without thanks from Ulriche and with a blurted \u201cBless you\u201d to Elias. That ranked him, in this room, somewhere between a useful saint and a well-worn spoon. She used the rosemary with a stern hand on the stew. \u201cOnly a little,\u201d Ulriche said, but Bettina did not always hear advice, even when it wore black and carried a key.\n\nOn the walk back, in the long narrow hall with the crucifix that had one bent nail, Elias slowed as if going downhill, as if at the bottom of the hall there might be a pool of cold and he didn\u2019t wish to be the first into it. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to step wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother would say a man walks into a prayer and tramps the corners down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t tramped anything,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cYou\u2019re careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a mason,\u201d he confessed, rubbing a thumb over his fingers like smoothing grit. \u201cThen my wrist. It\u2019s different work to grow things. I thought: give me something that needs me to be soft.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can be soft,\u201d she said. There was a wildness to saying that in this hall, a small stupidity, like taking off one\u2019s shoes on the shoulder of a road because the gravel music is sweet. But he didn\u2019t flinch. He let the words sit between them like a bowl of water set out for something shy.\n\n\u201cSister Verna thinks I talk too much to the sparrows,\u201d he added, with a quick sideways smile that pulled pleasantly at a place near his mouth people likely stared at when they found excuses to.\n\n\u201cSister Verna thinks talking is a sin if it isn\u2019t Latin,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cYou may talk to the sparrows.\u201d\n\nA light flickered; one of the bulbs had been failing all week, moving in and out of its reason like a child on a swing leaning backward too far. Ulriche reached up with the hem of her sleeve and twisted it in, giving the glow a stern, motherly look. It steadied.\n\n\u201cYou know how to make the light obey,\u201d Elias said.\n\n\u201cI know how to threaten things into cooperation,\u201d she replied, and then they were in the courtyard again, carrying on their tongues the taste of something unblessed.\n\nAfter he had gone she sat under the pear tree and wrote in her small notebook on a page she had told herself belonged to Jude. The page didn\u2019t mind being borrowed. She wrote: He carries rosemary like a candle, sidewise so the drip won\u2019t land on his hand. She wiped that out, too; the binding shivered; the notebook might have been laughing.\n\nNight made the garden into a question. The squirrels turned into the idea of squirrels. The bowl Elias had set out earlier caught a coal of sky and held it until the moon cracked it in half. Ulriche slipped from her bed to watch. The boards were honest about her weight. \u201cGo back,\u201d said Sister Agnes from somewhere behind the wardrobe.\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Ulriche said, \u201cas soon as I see the color change.\u201d She waited. It changed. She went back.\n\nIn November the mornings were wet as if someone had moistened the world with breath. She took her breakfast early and alone because Bettina believed hurry was a kind of prudence and served porridge before anyone wanted it. Ulriche\u2019s spoon made a sound like small thunder on the rim of her bowl. \u201cHave you decided yet,\u201d Sister Verna asked, appearing with her saucer of honey like a lady from a days-old painting, \u201cif you want the winter in the library to be lavender?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was lavender last winter,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cThe year before was cinnamon. Do you remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cLavender,\u201d Verna insisted without hearing, and nodded to herself as if given good counsel.\n\n\u201cRosemary,\u201d came a voice from the door; it was Sister Maribeth, showing a sprig like a banner. \u201cIt\u2019s good for thinking. For memory. For\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFor meat,\u201d Bettina said, ladling the porridge as if it might escape.\n\n\u201cRosemary, rosemary,\u201d Verna sang, and Bettina told her to stop it with an iron glance. \u201cYou\u2019ll make me forget what I forget purposefully,\u201d she said to Maribeth, and Maribeth tucked the sprig behind her ear prudently, as though it were a pencil she might need for sums.\n\nSo the herb spiraled around Ulriche\u2019s days. That week one of the children set an essay in her hands: The Uses and Abuses of Herbs by Mara Jane Kelleher, age nine. At the bottom she had drawn a rabbit that looked like an onion. \u201cDo I get a notion?\u201d Mara asked. She meant a sticker. Ulriche gave her one shaped like a star, which stuck itself crooked on Mara\u2019s cuff.\n\nElias\u2019s whistle rose and fell beyond the windows. She could pick out the moments he forgot to hold it and it slipped away. She stood at the stack of missals and pretended to count them to have reason to remain near the glass. Outside he stooped to talk to an absent cat. He said the things men say to animals they miss and think might come if praised in the right tone. The bowl for the squirrels sat near the rosemary bed and shivered when sparrows landed on its lip like gossiping women on a pew.\n\n\u201cDo something with your hands,\u201d Sister Agnes hissed in her ear. Ulriche picked up a book and put it down. She picked up her rosary. She dropped it. It made a falling sound that belonged in another world, the sound of beads hitting floor that people often remember in the last second before they give up something they cannot stop holding.\n\nIn confession she said: \u201cI covet a man\u2019s wrist, Father.\u201d\n\nFather Oliver said: \u201cHand. It\u2019s hand. Wrist is too specific.\u201d\n\n\u201cI covet his wrist,\u201d she repeated stubbornly, and the silence on the other side of the grate changed quality, acquired a texture that she recognized as the shape a man makes when he understands he has walked as far as he can on someone else\u2019s sentence. \u201cHe is kind,\u201d she said. \u201cThings grow because he means them to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are kinds of growth we do not invite,\u201d Father Oliver said, and then coughed, and Ulriche, who had once had a physician father who kept a little box of remedies in his study that smelled like mint and ground glass, worried stupidly for several days about Father Oliver\u2019s lungs.\n\n\u201cYou see foxes,\u201d Maribeth whispered the next morning, tugging at Ulriche\u2019s sleeve. \u201cIn the far lot. In daylight. Can you believe?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no foxes near the school,\u201d Sister Verna said, confident, and then blinked and said, \u201cDid you want me?\u201d to no one, and went back to whispering to her honey in case it had suggestions.\n\nUlriche went to the far lot during her hour of recreation and saw only a smudge of orange paint on a fence that someone had splashed there in the spring. It glowed pleasantly against the wood as if there had been a fire. On her way back she saw Elias with a pad of paper in his hands, scribbling, and she felt her heart wobble in her chest at the thought that someone who made things grow also made notes.\n\n\u201cWhat do you write?\u201d she asked, stopping short enough for the gravel to answer from beneath her shoes.\n\n\u201cNames,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s where. I keep forgetting if this is a black-eyed Susan that has gone to bed or something else that\u2019ll surprise me with a leaf shaped like a fish. And women\u2019s requests\u2014 they don\u2019t go where a man keeps them if he doesn\u2019t write them down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou keep our requests.\u201d She was too pleased. She knew it. It shone off her like sweat.\n\n\u201cI like instructions,\u201d he said simply.\n\n\u201cYou were a mason,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone once told you to make a wall fall into its mortar as if it were born there.\u201d\n\nHe smiled at the image with the sort of quiet abandon a man has when he recognizes his own thinking but wearing an unfamiliar hat. He tapped his pencil against his wrist twice. \u201cI want to do no harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll be lonely,\u201d she said, soft. He looked at her as if surprised she was that kind of woman, the one who would say such a sentence and not look down to see whether she\u2019d stepped in it.\n\n\u201cNot always,\u201d he said finally. \u201cIt depends on who you stand beside and whether they go blunt or bright when something breaks.\u201d\n\nThere was a squirrel near the ash that had learned to stand on its hind legs and beg without shame. Elias laughed and gave it sunflower seeds. It curled its hands around his finger the way a child does with a mother\u2019s hairpins. Ulriche could not help it. The laughter braided itself to the sight and made a rope that tied something in her.\n\nThat evening, at Compline, her voice wobbled and the line she was meant to sing turned out to have a bend in it that her throat had to step around. \u201cDo you have a fever?\u201d Sister Bettina demanded, putting her rough hand on Ulriche\u2019s forehead with the good authority of someone who had been told, long ago, that this was comfort.\n\n\u201cI am just not in tune,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cMy string is winter-dry.\u201d\n\nIn her cell she lay awake listening to the slow, distant buckling of the old pipes and the near, familiar noise her mind made in the middle of the night, a sort of thrumm. She thought of Elias\u2019s pencil and the small groove a man\u2019s skin holds after a thing is taken away from it. She decided in a whisper spoken to no one that she would ask to help in the garden, just an hour, as a test of obedience in the other direction. God owns the rosemary. God owns my ridiculous wrist.\n\nWhen she asked the prioress at breakfast, Mother Heloise bent a little so their faces were closer than they usually were allowed to be and said, with a kindness that grated because it seemed reluctant, as though it had been pulled out of her throat by a hook, \u201cYou are very useful where you are. Do not set yourself out like a bowl on a sill and wait for what comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll work in the library,\u201d Ulriche said, and then, because she had carried the request into the room and was not yet brave enough to drop it, added, almost in the same breath: \u201cBut the garden is short of hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrother Flint will come more often.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no\u2014\u201d\n\nMother Heloise tapped the table lightly, a sign not to contradict but to accept that the world is composite and some boards, when leaned on, squeak. \u201cI will ask Sister Verna to see to the rosemary. That will be full of morals for her.\u201d\n\nUlriche swallowed. The porridge had gone gluey; it stuck on the way down and then moved with a jerk that made her close her eyes. When she opened them Maribeth was looking at her with a face that had remembered something too late.\n\n\u201cYou can read to me in the afternoons,\u201d Father Oliver said later, finding her behind a stack of pamphlets that announced a fair that had already happened. He was holding his cough in like a parcel at the post office. \u201cOur minds like to be outside in winter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are convenient,\u201d Ulriche said, and at once hated the acid in her voice. But Father Oliver either did not hear it or was accustomed to the flavor.\n\n\u201cPerhaps you could read something about gardening,\u201d he said blandly, and she stared at his sideburn to punish herself by having to look somewhere silly. He patted the top of a chair, and she stood because if she sat her bones would become the chair\u2019s and she was not yet willing to be furniture.\n\nShe did not go to the garden that day, nor the next. On Thursday Elias came and stood at the library door with his cap in his hands like a man about to ask for a child\u2019s release. \u201cSister,\u201d he said softly, and the syllables took their time, each one in a bowl of its own.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, seeing, at his shoulder, the ghost of a leaf pressed very flat between two pages somewhere.\n\n\u201cI caught my sleeve,\u201d he said, showing her a rip, barely an inch, that had caught on the rose canes by the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s a spot on a thorn that hooks like it was hammered to snare. I thought you might know how to keep this from unraveling itself to the elbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want mending,\u201d Ulriche said, relief rising in her like steam because she could do this without being suspected of wanting it. \u201cBring it here.\u201d She took his sleeve in both hands; he had slipped his arm out of the coat and stood in his thin shirt, gooseflesh rising politely on his skin. The tear was small but strategic, near the seam, sly. She threaded her needle, which lived in a book, as all the best tools do, and licked the end of the thread. He looked away with a delicacy that made her want to look more closely.\n\n\u201cMy mother would have said to spit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYour mother would have been correct,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cSpit makes everything obedient that otherwise prefers to talk back.\u201d\n\nHe made a huffing sound that wanted to be a laugh and wasn\u2019t certain whether he ought to be born. She put the coat over her knees and stitched with care that bordered on prayer. Small, neat, like writing on rice. \u201cThere,\u201d she said. \u201cPut your arm back in and don\u2019t be proud. Lift the other sleeve into the thorn if you must, but not this one.\u201d It was a small joke, and it made him smile, and for a moment she allowed herself to believe that moments were allowed to be their own size and did not have to grow up into days that carried visible consequences with all the gravity of a name carved in stone.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, and then, quickly, because he seemed to be learning the practice of saying what he was thinking before prudence plucked it back: \u201cYou look tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cI read to Father Oliver,\u201d she said, as though reading were labor unmighty as dragging a ship up a beach. \u201cThe Romans invented every possible terrible way to make a road.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Romans had an answer to everything except kindness,\u201d Elias murmured.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s harsh. Cicero loved his daughter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot enough to make a difference on the road,\u201d he said, and lifted his repaired arm and flexed it once, twice, as if he were testing a hinge. \u201cIt\u2019s strong,\u201d he said, and looked at her, and looked away, and the room grew a little wider around them, as if someone had opened a window.\n\nThat night frost came, and the rosemary took it personally. Elias wrapped the beds in burlap like parcels he meant to ship to some generous god with a more temperate porch. Ulriche watched from the shadow of the cloister and whispered a psalm whose words held in their thin hands what she could not carry herself.\n\nThe first snow fell like paper mistakes\u2014 small, light, erasing nothing but suggesting a new draft. Ulriche stood again under the arch and let three flakes land on the back of her hand and vanish and thought, suddenly wild with it, that if someone were to touch her just then she would leave a mark in the shape of a ghost.\n\n\u201cSister,\u201d Elias said, near enough for her to smell carrot greens on his cuffs. He was quiet. \u201cI ran over a squirrel on the road last night.\u201d\n\nHer breath jerked in; it was not an event and yet it was. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Washington by the park. It darted. I was not\u2014 I mean, I had not expected\u2014 I\u2019ve driven that road a hundred times and there\u2019s no good way to\u2014 it comes before you\u2019re done with the first thought and after the second, and then there it is also after the last\u2014\u201d He stopped. He looked ill.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d she said. She meant it in the old, wide sense, I grieve near you.\n\n\u201cI heard it,\u201d he said. He put a hand knuckles-first to his mouth so he would not have to describe the sound and also as if he might be able to push the sound back in, make his mouth a hole for burying it. \u201cI stopped, and there was nothing to fix. Its little feet.\u201d He swallowed with care. He looked at her with a heat that could have belonged to anger at her for standing in a place where he could see her. He deserved to be reticent now, to be alone if that was required. \u201cI didn\u2019t know all the parts of me it would break.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are allowed to mourn anything you touch,\u201d she said, and her voice came out too thin and too wise; the combination was intolerable. He flinched, a small movement that wanted to be a run but couldn\u2019t in this space and in this habit. \u201cElias,\u201d she said, daring his name in their small morning, \u201cyou are not\u2014 you do not\u2014 it is not a sin to be broken in a place that didn\u2019t ask permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not what?\u201d he asked. There was anger there, to her shock, like an iron making up its mind to be hot.\n\n\u201cYou are not wrong,\u201d she said, and cursed herself for sounding like a schoolbook. \u201cYou are not wrong. You are not wrong.\u201d Saying it thrice made it harsher, like soap suds piling up where someone has scrubbed too long.\n\nHe breathed out, an old air that had been sitting in him for hours. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d she said, and then realized she didn\u2019t know where that sentence ended. Into God, into the warm, into the place with tea in a chipped cup, into the portion of her that was a room with its chair already in it.\n\nHe did not come in. He stood on the path and held his arms against himself as if to keep in all the heat he felt he hadn\u2019t earned. \u201cI\u2019m ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cMen are ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople do not move the same speed,\u201d she said, and it was poor comfort and also the only true thing she had in her satchel. \u201cIf something small catches in a wheel, it doesn\u2019t matter to the wheel what the size was.\u201d\n\nHe nodded then, so slightly she might have imagined it, and turned away, stepping as if the ground might be thin in places. He went toward the gate and through it, and she went toward Morning Office, and the bell braided the difference between them into something official.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at him,\u201d Sister Agnes warned, and then, gently, like someone who has found a large animal on a porch and wants to back away without startling it: \u201cYou are holding yourself too tight. Your voice will break like icicles.\u201d\n\nShe kept her eyes on the book, on the good black print that never varied from page to page like a hand you could trust on your back. She sang and her throat responded with the obedience she paid it to, and it sounded like a dozen other mornings, and no one saw that her breath carried over and thinned where another woman\u2019s would have deepened, no one but herself, who lived there always and therefore could not pretend ignorance.\n\nThere was a squirrel on the rain barrel again that afternoon. She stood at the window and saw it lifting a single piece of bread under its chin the way a child hides a secret in their T-shirt. She thought of the wheel. She thought of Father Oliver\u2019s cough. She thought of the rosemary\u2014 the way its leaves were little green nails\u2014 and how the frost had made it taste sharper, almost like a reprimand.\n\nMara came in and asked for more poems. \u201cNot about horses,\u201d she said quickly, catching herself. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Ulriche said, and gave her a book with a train on the cover. \u201cThese have wheels; it will be all right.\u201d\n\nMara nodded solemnly. \u201cMy mother says I shouldn\u2019t get attached to things that can go away. But if you don\u2019t get attached then the world turns into a coat and you never put your hands in the pockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are cold pockets,\u201d Ulriche said.\n\n\u201cJust some,\u201d Mara agreed. \u201cBut then you put a warm rock in.\u201d\n\nWhen the library was empty she sat down with her own notebook and wrote: He will not come to the garden. He will not whistle. There is a bowl and yet nothing cups water with its hands. She looked at the sentence and scowled; she was too elaborate; she was a woman in love with a metaphor because she was not yet permitted to be in love with the man whom the metaphor had been meant to make safe.\n\nThat night in the refectory she ate pears cut too early and therefore punishing. Sister Verna argued with the salt cellar. Sister Bettina told a story about geese, her hands flapping politely at the interesting parts. Father Oliver did not sit with them; his cough had learned their timings and now came when laughter embarrassed them. Mother Heloise touched Ulriche\u2019s sleeve once and said, softly, \u201cBeware your invention,\u201d and Ulriche did not know if she meant the stories she told herself or the new way she had of making the world obey her when it ought not.\n\nIn her cell before the candle she took the rosary and held it to her mouth without quite saying the prayers. The beads smelled faintly of smoke, of skin that had known a long winter and made peace with it. She was both the person with the prayer and the person it fell around, and there were others in the room\u2014 Agnes and Verna and Maribeth and Heloise and Oliver and Flint who didn\u2019t exist and yet sometimes clacked his teeth in the corridor and said: it needs mortar here, girl, more mortar\u2014 and she thought, with the cool clarity of a woman counting last coins: I am talking to myself. She did not name the fact again; she dropped it into the water of the bowl on the sill of her mind and the moon cut it in half and left it there, two silvers she might spend later or never.\n\nIn the morning Elias did not come to the garden. In the afternoon he came and stood at a distance and looked at the rosemary with a grief that had the odd, clean edges of a new plate. He tied burlap to the bedposts as if mummifying a queen. He did not look at the bowl. He emptied it. He turned the water out onto the gravel, which sucked it down with a thirst that felt inappropriate to her, greedy. The bowl lay on its side, an ear listening to the ground for footsteps.\n\nUlriche went down with a broom and swept the path for no reason at all. \u201cIt is cold,\u201d she said, because the air had to be told what it was in case it had forgotten and needed reminding to remain consistent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying not to drive,\u201d he said without preamble, not even looking at her. \u201cI took my bicycle into town and then I found a reason not to go at all. Is there a way not to go at all? I thought I could stay in the small places and nothing fast would cross there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe small places turn into roads if you stand in them too long.\u201d\n\nHe shut his eyes briefly, like someone bracing for cold water. \u201cIt was a squirrel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters the way anything matters that had a face,\u201d she said, and he winced as if she\u2019d said something indecent. They were both so tired of their own gentleness.\n\n\u201cSister,\u201d he said, and swallowed. \u201cUlriche.\u201d Her name came out like an ash in his mouth that he did not want to spit out in case it shocked the adjacent hearth. \u201cI keep thinking I can make the world safe if I move slow enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a good thought for a gardener, a bad one for a man in a car,\u201d she said, and he laughed once, a bitter bark at his own mistake, and looked at the empty bowl as if it had betrayed him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t put water out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just reminds them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t become desert to control the animals we love,\u201d she said, and he flinched again at the word love, even though it belonged to squirrels.\n\n\u201cI have to\u2014\u201d he began, and did not finish. Everything inside him had turned to slope. He couldn\u2019t stand on any of it.\n\nAfter he left, a robin went into the empty bowl to see if it had misplaced the idea of water. Ulriche lifted it and filled it halfway and set it back. It reflected only a thin line of sky. She watched it and felt, in her throat, the stupid bravery of a song.\n\nAt night she dreamed she was driving, though she had never learned and would never. The road was a long, level ribbon of unspooling cloth, and the trees leaned in like gossips. In the road there were buttons and coins and a single spoon. She couldn\u2019t avoid all of them. She felt each small thing fuss under the wheels and then be a nothing behind. When she woke her hands hurt from gripping the sheet and the candle had burned down to a small sugar of wax that smelled like his sleeve.\n\nIn the days that followed Elias did not touch the rosemary. He went around it as if it were an open grave. He tended the winter cabbage with the close attention of a nurse to a child who refuses broth. He wrote fewer names. He came to the library once and stood a generous distance from the door and said, \u201cDo you have a book that doesn\u2019t know what it is about?\u201d and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s all of them,\u201d and he said, \u201cI mean something that won\u2019t tell me something I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d and she picked through the dumb animals of prose and found an almanac that predicted only weather that had already happened.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, not looking at her, but looking at his hands as if somewhere between his fingers a map would begin to appear that would save him.\n\n\u201cElias,\u201d she said, and then, because there was no one else in the room but the two of them and all the women in her she had carried in to be witnesses and to keep her honest, \u201cI want you to be all right.\u201d\n\nHe nodded once, slow, and said, without looking up, \u201cYou make sentences that look like bridges,\u201d and then turned and walked through a door that had not been open a moment before.\n\nWhen the snow was finally real, not paper but wet and insisting, Sister Bettina\u2019s stew tasted like a home that had thought of other people first. Father Oliver\u2019s cough settled into his chest with the heaviness of a dog inside for the winter. Mother Heloise asked Ulriche to inventory the schoolbooks. Sister Verna arranged the honey in the cupboard by light and lighter and lightest. Sister Agnes never entered a room she did not leave at once if Ulriche was already there.\n\nIt was a good season to be quiet and yet she was loud with care. She kept seeing the squirrel\u2019s little hand on Elias\u2019s finger taking seed. She kept seeing the moment the bowl turned over and became a listening thing. She kept seeing, in her mind, a road that she had never driven and a movement she had never made except in dream.\n\nAt Vespers she sang and her voice did not break. At Compline her hands were steady. In the night she woke and put her feet on the floor and said the names of all the saints the mason had made alike and wished for each one of them a different face. In the morning she told the squirrel on the rain barrel that there would be water again in the bowl today, that the gardener had not meant the world to be dry forever, that sometimes people needed to stop in order to be able to start without burning the engine out of themselves.\n\nThe squirrel\u2019s ears twitched. It had its own business. Ulriche laughed. The bell rang and the sound was exactly the same and completely different, and she gathered her basket and her breath and went out into the courtyard toward the rosemary that had argued with frost and won, barely, and felt the old, unwieldy feeling blooming again under the habits she wore, the detested and loved abundance. She stepped carefully, not because she was fragile, but because the ground itself seemed to have learned to test her, to tilt just slightly at the edges. She would have to learn to keep her weight in the middle.\n\nThe day took up its instruments and began, and somewhere beyond the wall a car went by with a low, anesthetized sound like a prayer said by someone not sure whether they meant it. She pulled the thread in her sleeve tight, the one that held today to yesterday, and tried not to watch which way it went when the knot did its work.",

                              "content": "Advent made the light softer, as if the day had wrapped itself in gauze and could only be handled with clean fingers. Someone had tucked sprigs of cedar behind the statues\u2019 blank-eyed patience, and the cloister smelled like a good coat brought down from a high shelf. Ulriche caught herself saying \u201cO come,\u201d under her breath without the rest of it, and stopped, embarrassed, because it felt like calling someone out of a doorway and then not holding it for them. The rosemary had taken to exhaling at odd moments, its scent rising when no wind moved, as if it had decided on its own schedule of remembrance. The bowl on the gravel wore a petal of ice each morning now, thin as a fingernail; she lifted it with the tip of one finger, cracked it, and felt the small, treacherous pleasure of breaking something so perfectly round.\n\nFather Oliver\u2019s cough found the hollow places in the chapel and set up house there, tapping at the plaster as if asking politely for more room. Later, in his little office that smelled faintly of old ink and the toasted edges of maybe-mistakes, she read to him from a borrowed anthology of Roman speeches and then from the legends of saints, because he had asked for something with a spine made of vowels. \u201cLucy,\u201d he said, when she paused for his breath to catch up with him, \u201cis a good one for winter. Light on the head. Courage in her pockets.\u201d He made a motion with his hand as if setting candles in a circle on water. \u201cThe girls will want a procession. It steadies them to balance flame.\u201d\n\n\u201cFire and hair,\u201d Ulriche said, dubious. \u201cWe are fools for God and also for pageantry.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth are good for a body that doesn\u2019t know where to put its extra heat,\u201d he murmured, and coughed until his eyes watered and then smiled apologetically at the floor.\n\nPreparations took up space in the halls. Sister Bettina wrapped wire in circles and tucked rosemary and laurel and a stray branch of holly through them until they looked like crowns that had been left in a cupboard through three dynasties and still remembered whose heads they had touched. Sister Verna licked her thumb and rubbed at a spot on the wall where a child\u2019s hand had been briefly present, then went back to humming a tune from a century that had never happened. The girls tried on the idea of being lucifers with grave seriousness, mouths pursed, hands flat as they practiced the art of not tipping the small flames that would one day find them again in dream and ask to be balanced. Maribeth walked behind them and held her hands ready, as if she could catch falling light like a mother catches a cup that tips just past the point of saving.\n\nElias stayed mostly at the far end of the garden, where the cabbages made a bouquet of the close kind, green packed into green. He had rebuilt the compost bin from palleted wood and a patience that made the boards tell him where they wanted to be, and he turned the heap with a slow, mindful zeal that did not trouble the rats and therefore troubled him. Once, when Ulriche opened the library window to air the dust that hung heavy as though it had been taught to settle by an old woman, she heard him whistle once and then stop, mid-bird, as if the tune had remembered itself and fled. The bowl lay newly upright; water found its round again. The first day there were no visitors, and the second day a robin with a chest like a small argument tried it out and made the surface tremble around its idea of thirst.\n\nShe set aside a little time each afternoon to inventory the books she was pretending to inventory. She touched their spines and said the titles aloud, which is the kind of inventory words prefer. The heating pipes spoke in the ceiling, a private Morse of knocks and groans that meant something to the building and to no one else. One evening, when the cold came in like a man with a key and an authority to enter, the pipes stopped speaking and then protested in a startled clatter, then went quiet in a way that made her dislike the silence simply because it had been chosen without her. She went on counting, and when she reached the shelf of parish histories the ceiling made a sound like a decision.\n\nThe decision was water. It found an old path in the plaster and took it with the eager, innocent confidence of anything obeying an inclination set up long before it was born. It came dark first, then shining, then falling in a curtained rush that made her feel how much a book weighs when it has taken in what it cannot use. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, and the word was not at all useful but felt necessary as a person\u2019s hand extended on instinct toward a pot falling where it shouldn\u2019t. She ran and heard her own feet swear at the floor. \u201cBettina,\u201d she called, and \u201cMaribeth,\u201d and heard her voice hit the corners and bounce.\n\nThe library took on the soggy gravity of a harbor in a bad dream. Ulriche dragged a cart into the rain and began to build a lopsided ark. \u201cFlat first,\u201d she muttered, and lifted all the folios whose backs would give first under this, whose pages would make islands of mold if handled with anything less than love. Maribeth appeared with her sleeves rolled to the elbow, small and everywhere, catching the falling water with pans and a single, ancient washbowl that had belonged to a woman who had washed other things and would not begrudge books this use. Sister Verna whispered to the leaking plaster in Latin that had not been taught for this purpose. Sister Agnes lifted her veil and tied it up in a knot at the nape of her neck as if going into a kitchen fight and began to lay sheets of brown paper between sodden pages with the efficiency of someone who has always known how to triage the too-wet.\n\nElias came as if the building had sent for him. His boots tracked in a lawful measure of snow; his hair was full of it, like the head of a saint in a fresco that had been painted badly and in love with white. He saw the arc of water and the lists of books and did not ask permission; he reached for the heaviest things and carried them like a man carrying sleeping children out of a room where someone had forgotten about the oven door. \u201cWhere?\u201d he said, and let her point him without questions toward the long tables in the cloister where the wind would keep the damp from settling in with its coat and luggage. He went back and forth as if a narrow river had been cut through him and he could step it without speech.\n\n\u201cUpright,\u201d Ulriche said to anyone who would listen, and not everyone did. \u201cGently. Fan them like a bird opening. Paper, paper, paper. No heat. Never heat.\u201d She heard herself and was briefly ashamed of the command in her mouth, which felt like the taste of a word she had avoided and now found too easy, then forgave herself because breath had to go somewhere. Sister Bettina brought every towel that had ever dried a nun and a dish, including the ones that smelled faintly of old onion, and made neat stacks that relieved Ulriche\u2019s heart just for their orderly existence. Sister Heloise arrived with her shoulders squared into what she believed was the shape of a threshold and set four of the schoolboys to the noble business of holding books open gently with clean, dry hands. \u201cDon\u2019t break the backs,\u201d Ulriche said to them, and they blushed all at once and then understood that she meant the visible spines and not their own.\n\n\u201cBrother Flint says a split happens where no one intends,\u201d Elias said without looking up, and Ulriche nodded sharply because she could hear the clack of phantom teeth in the far hall and did not have her hands free to cross herself against it. He stood in water to his ankles and seemed not to care about the soaking. He set heavy, swollen volumes down with a courtesy that would have made a mother\u2019s eyes warm. When he slipped once, the floor behaving like a separate person with poor loyalties, Ulriche turned without thinking and put her hand to his wrist. It was cold and damp and had the frail bravado of something that has broken once and tries to remember how not to. She held him, not long and not lightly, and then let go, and he righted and kept working, and his ears reddened as if each had taken upon itself to carry a discrete portion of his certainty.\n\nMaribeth ran out into the biting rightness of the air with her arms full and then back in. \u201cI will lose a toe,\u201d she said to no one, and went out again. Father Oliver had been fetched or had sent himself, and now he stood useless and gasping in the doorway and then, with effort that cost him a minute of breath, went away and came back with two old window screens that he had suddenly remembered under his bed. Elias looked at them and smiled with the quick, narrow happiness of a man seeing a tool arrive when he had already made a space for it in his mind. He balanced books on them to let the air climb through. \u201cTomorrow I can make more,\u201d he said without moving his mouth much, and Ulriche, who had no right, wanted to put her hand in the space between his shoulder blades and feel the place where that promise had started.\n\nThe books lay on the tables under the cloister and breathed like animals not yet persuaded to stay. The wind was good but had the wrong kind of faith; it would dry anything but could not be told where to stop. Ulriche walked the line of pages like a nurse with a lantern. She slid paper between leaves and said little things to them, only the kinds of sentences that books remember. The girls with candles in their futures stood at the edges and held their hands very still, as if practicing carrying flame and moisture, weight and nothing. Sister Agnes sawed through her sarcasm and made neat piles of damp paper that would be useful again if treated right. Sister Heloise assigned clumsy tasks to herself and carried them out with a thoroughness that made her ankles wobble at the end of each trip. Father Oliver sat down when he shouldn\u2019t have and put his head in his hands and then laughed once, gently, at his own weakness.\n\nBy the time the men came with wrenches as long as arms and shut the water\u2019s idea off, the library had been rewritten in the air. Ulriche stood under the stain in the ceiling and felt the presence of time as a thing that could ruin and preserve with equal talent. Elias came to stand near, aware enough to stay at the distance at which a person\u2019s breath is their own again. His hair had dried into points that made him look slightly electrified. His hands were mottled red where the cold had kept its teeth too long.\n\n\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d she said, and it was a lie told with a responsible heart, because some of the books had already swelled past recognition and would be reduced to pulp and then to memory, and anyway she wasn\u2019t speaking only of books because a person\u2019s throat cannot be ordered to select its objects. Elias nodded, and the shape of the nod was not yes but I believe you want it.\n\nThat night, when the procession went down the middle of the chapel, the lights had been cut at the fuse-box as a caution against wiring that had taken the water personally and was considering a bad marriage with it. The girls\u2019 crowns held four candles each, and the room was transformed into a lake with small boats that knew how to row themselves, slow, orphanly brave. Rosemary had found its way into some of the wreaths, sharp green among the benevolent laurel, and the heat coaxed its oil up in a smell that made the inside of Ulriche\u2019s mouth taste like someone saying her name in a winter house. She was not crowned; that belonged to a child whose passion for a straight spine could be seen from the back pew. Ulriche carried a taper and held it as if it were a pen that might drip fire if she was careless, which all pens do if attended badly.\n\nThe hymn made the chapel lean in. Ulriche sang and felt her own voice walk carefully now, not for fear of slipping but because it pleased her to place her foot right. When the girls tilted to make the bend, the song shifted and the air moved and a few drops of molten wax fell onto the black cloth of someone\u2019s shoulder and left pale coins there, which would be picked off later with the satisfying ritual of fingernails knowing their business. Elias had come to the far back and stood like a volunteer fireman called to witness rather than to work. When the smallest girl\u2019s candle guttered, he did nothing, because sometimes what is required is not answering the flame\u2019s question until it asks a second time, and by then the girl had found her breath and given it carefully. Ulriche\u2019s eye snagged on Elias\u2019s outline and then let go, and she sang the last verse with the feeling that sometimes light prefers to live in a man instead of on his head.\n\nAfter the candles had made their little smoke and the room smelled briefly of clean tunnels, the girls took off their crowns and rubbed their scalps as if they had been holding a thought too long. Outside, a skiff of snow had had opinions about the world and made everything tidier. Ulriche stepped into the cold the way one steps into a question and felt the bite on her teeth. Elias was waiting near the low wall where a drunk had once slept for three months and then gone away without saying goodbye to the stone. He had something small in his hand that shone dully in the light from the sacristy.\n\n\u201cYou dropped this,\u201d he said, and held out her thimble. It was the brass one with the dent like a moon where once a stubborn needle had taught her about pressure and luck. \u201cBy the screens,\u201d he added, as if he had to locate it in the day for her to be permitted to touch it again. She took it, and their fingers did not meet, because he knew too, now, how not to turn every kindness into a confession.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and the thank you meant more than the thimble and less than the whole of the future, which is a kind of politeness. They stood and let their breath be mistaken for speech. He looked toward the far lot beyond the wall, where the snow lit itself. \u201cI saw a fox,\u201d he said quietly, and his voice had that cautious postscript tone people have when they are mentioning a thing the morning will forget. \u201cIt was looking at me as if I had brought it here by saying fox aloud.\u201d\n\nMaribeth appeared long enough to say, \u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d and vanish, which is how she preferred to authenticate miracles without spoiling them.\n\nThe next day the library wore its guts on the outside in a way that would have embarrassed a prideful building. Books stood in long lines with their mouths open. The small boys came in on tiptoe and stared as if at a wounded soldier whose story they suspected was noble and bad. Mara touched a spine with the kind of care reserved for sleeping cats and asked if the poems would be harmed. \u201cPoems don\u2019t mold easily,\u201d Ulriche said, and did not mind that the statement could not bear examination. Mara brought her breath and tried to use it like a fan, polite about the pieces of herself she offered. \u201cI wrote about the flood,\u201d she said, and showed a paper with a title too grand for its size, The Water Comes But We Button Back, which made Ulriche laugh in the manner of a person who has needed a small absurdity and found it placed perfectly into her hand.\n\nElias came with frames he had made out of old screens and sticks that had once been part of something else and now were happier. He set them up quietly and handed them over as if returning a borrowed thing. \u201cI made the mesh loose,\u201d he said, and she nodded and did not say what she was thinking, which was that the sight of a useful thing made by the mind she had been watching was a frostflower in her. He grinned once, quickly, when one of the boys said, with reverence, \u201cIt\u2019s like a fort,\u201d and then put his grin away as if he had wrapped it in cloth and set it on a high shelf for later.\n\nMother Heloise, who was not unobservant when she allowed herself to be, caught Ulriche by the shoulder as she went by and said softly, in a tone that pretended to be about housekeeping, \u201cBe sure to leave the doors open a little so the air is never surprised.\u201d Ulriche murmured that she would. Heloise\u2019s fingers tightened and then let go, as if they had been told, by some older woman who once had young fingers, that letting go is its own order.\n\nThat night the pipes were fixed with a noise that came up through the floorboards like a man clearing his throat after a long sermon. The heat resumed its exhausted habits. Ulriche sat on the edge of her bed with her notebook in her lap and wrote without crossing anything out: The books breathe, and I go from one to another with a hand that knows only to open. If a page tears, it is because I forgot it would. If a life tears, perhaps it is also because I believed in the paper more than in the air. Agnes rustled in the wardrobe with the dry authority of someone who knows how to fold a sheet so that its corners meet. \u201cDon\u2019t be clever for the sake of being not-sad,\u201d she said, and Ulriche closed the notebook with something like obedience and blew out the candle with something like courage.\n\nWhen she woke in the deep, the snow had added itself, and the moon had chosen a square of garden to sit on. She went to the window and saw the bowl with a lid on, neat as a pie. She took her robe and went out into the pitiless and then became part of it by forgetting to hate it. Her breath made her veil move, and she laughed at herself because she still found that surprising. She touched the ice and broke it and said a small apology to no one. In the far lot, a line cut through the new snow where a fox had decided the shortest way between two pieces of itself was a straight one, and for a second the world seemed to her a place where the shapes of animals could be read the way the liturgy could be read, with the right voice and with hands steady enough to turn the page.\n\n\u201cGod owns the rosemary,\u201d she told the bowl, because the bowl, unlike God, benefited from being addressed directly. \u201cHe also owns the pipes and the way that water remembers its childhood in the hills. He owns my wrist. He owns everything I should put away.\u201d The bowl did not answer, which was proper. The bell began, low and then thinner and then low again, like a man unsure whether anyone was listening until he heard himself.\n\nShe kept her eyes down at Lauds and then raised them because a person who is always down becomes a person who reads only one kind of letter. Father Oliver\u2019s cough receded as men recede into better rooms. Maribeth wore lint like a crown. Sister Verna asked whether sugar remembered its cane when it was set in tea, and no one answered because she had not asked them in any language they knew. Sister Bettina trimmed the rosemary back as if a hard truth could be softened by being given a neat haircut and then tucked the cuttings into the kitchen with a sternness that liked to pretend itself to be generosity.\n\nThe fox\u2019s tracks were gone by midday, replaced by the scrawl of children and the sensible, resigned rectangles of adult feet. Elias spent an hour mending the fence where the snow had shown him how badly it wanted to lean in. He waved, once, in a way that told her he knew she had seen him and also knew they were holding themselves to a kind of hunger that had become, not virtue, but a woven habit one could recognize by its pattern even at a distance. She waved back, a small piece of cloth lifted to show consent to the weather.\n\nIn the afternoon she opened a book that had dried nicely and placed her hand on the first page as if greeting a living thing returned from a fever. The paper felt like a healed place. The words, blotted and dim in spots, seemed to her braver for having survived the water\u2019s insistence. She bent and breathed them in, and for a moment did not feel the strain of being watched by rules or the soft, incessant pressure of a kindness that the world had not decided where to put. She felt only that there are some pages a person arrives at by accident and others a person chooses and that, in both cases, the turning is the point and not the destination. She touched the knot of thread at her sleeve and tugged it once, to reassure herself that it knew its business, and then she went to see whether the bowl had kept its thin lid off for the sparrows, because there are some duties a woman keeps because they allow her to remain exactly herself in the face of the day.",

It slid off the slate like a sister\u2019s veil when she gave herself permission to run between errands, then clung in small petulant ridges on the north sides of stones where no sun ever bothered to argue. The library wore its convalescence without complaining; books lined the tables and pews like patients who pretended not to notice one another\u2019s bandages, and Ulriche moved among them with the quiet of a nurse taught by winters that the body prefers the sound of a soft hand over any heroics. \u201cAir,\u201d she told the pages, and tucked slips of paper where damp insisted it could make a home, the way a woman tucks necessary truths into conversation without bruising the listener. The stain on the ceiling dried into the shape of a country she would never visit, a coastline oddly faithful to some failure of plaster long ago, and she found herself tracing it with her eyes as though in another lifetime she had been a cartographer who believed the world could be made safe by being named thoroughly.\n\nFather Oliver\u2019s cough wore down to a lower rasp that fooled no one. He sat under a blanket that had belonged to two priors and a mouse and listened to her read with the attentiveness of a man allowing a voice to hold the parts of him that had grown unwieldy. She chose differently now without admitting it, set aside the Roman\u2019s roads for legends where people went on foot and found their way by smell and the kindness of small towns. \u201cAgnes of Rome,\u201d she read one afternoon because the name behaved like a hook in her mind and because she didn\u2019t want to ask who in the house would die first, \u201crefused what everyone called sensible, and the world did not break because of it, any more than a pond breaks when a bird steps on its own reflection.\u201d Father Oliver smiled without moving his mouth much and looked at the thin skin over his knuckles as if it had a better suggestion than his lungs did. \u201cNames are a comfort,\u201d he said, and when he leaned forward to cough into his handkerchief she pretended she did not see the red blooming there like a difficult thought.\n\nShe did the arithmetic she hated and came with it to Mother Heloise, who had balanced books that did not forgive and rules that did not remember who had asked for them. Heloise listened with her fingers folded into the shape of a house around a little air, and then she nodded once and sent Sister Verna to telephone Dr. Shanahan in a voice steady enough to make herself sound like a ship at anchor. The wire spoke back with its own lucidity\u2014 there would be a delay, there was weather, there was another woman nearer to birthing than to praying\u2014 and then there was the fact that a man whose lungs had decided to be winter could not wait like a sensible letter. \u201cWe\u2019ll fetch him,\u201d Heloise said, words heavy with the years they had behaved themselves and now brought to bear on a single useful disobedience. \u201cThe boy from the school?\u201d she added, and then looked at Ulriche\u2019s face and corrected herself without explanation. \u201cElias.\u201d\n\nUlriche found him in the yard turning snow away from the rosemary with a broom as if persuading a child that a bed was not a prison. He had grown cautious with his own hands, the way a man does who has learned that one part of him can throw the rest into muddle. He saw her and straightened and then did something she had not seen before; he put the broom down and stepped away from it as if it had power over him he hadn\u2019t consented to give. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asked, and his mouth had learned not to waste any words on fear in a moment that had chosen to carry more than one person\u2019s breathing.\n\n\u201cFather Oliver,\u201d she said, and the name brought the weight of the blanket and the red handkerchief and the foolish Roman roads into the courtyard where the rosemary smelled like winter\u2019s pocket. \u201cShanahan will come if we go fetch him. Heloise asks, and I\u2014 ask too.\u201d It was dangerous, the second request; it made the air thinner; it made the snow listen.\n\nHe blinked and did not look toward the gate, which is how you know a man has already made his decision and wishes to spare his body the disorientation of admitting it. \u201cI can,\u201d he said. There was a hinge in the present tense that opened a little and then closed. \u201cI will.\u201d He wiped both hands on the butchered knees of his trousers as if taking dirt off the flesh would make courage find better purchase. \u201cI\u2019ll get my coat,\u201d he added, and then paused, and the pause contained a road and a memory with small feet. \u201cYou\u2019ll come?\u201d he said, not because he needed permission from her to do what the world required, but because his breath would prefer company that remembered how to count.\n\nShe did not know that she would ever again have permission to say yes to that particular request, and so she said it now, before prudence could rise like a mother from the next room to put its hand on her head. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll hold the doctor\u2019s bag if he brings one. I\u2019ll hold my breath if I must.\u201d She went inside to get her shawl and when she returned Sister Agnes was already at the door with a hat she pretended had always been meant for Ulriche\u2019s head. \u201cKeep the teeth behind your lips,\u201d Agnes commanded softly, an instruction that could be read backward as well as forward, and Ulriche nodded in that way a person does when told something they know and fear with equal measure they will not be able to obey.\n\nThe car had been sulking under a fall of snow that made it appear more innocent than its history. Elias brushed it like a reluctant animal and opened the door with the courtesy of a man visiting a neighbor he does not favor but cannot ignore. Inside, the upholstery let out its stored breath, a warm, tired smell of wool and old road. \u201cIf I drive slow,\u201d he said, and didn\u2019t finish because the sentence had been proven inadequate in other contexts. She folded her skirt and put her hands flat on her knees the way a woman does in a pew when wondering whether God has noticed the bargain she is making with herself. The engine shivered, made up its mind, and then beheld the snow with the generous caution of something that had grown wise by breaking only once.\n\nThe road had turned into a chalk line pulled taught between one need and another. Houses wore their winter faces, the ones with the blinds at half-mast and the porches pretending they were not lonely. The wipers practiced a poor liturgy and then a better one; the glass set its own rhythm and they obeyed. Elias held the wheel the way a person holds a child who might sleep and might not, and Ulriche watched his knuckles and found out again that the body will grow tenderness toward anything that has not harmed it. She kept her eyes busy on the hedges at the edges of town, because she could not bear to watch the road with his kind of vigilance and also because she had read that the thing you watch for comes in by another door.\n\nThey reached the park where the squirrel had elected oblivion and the road under the tires changed its mind about being purely obedient. Elias\u2019s breath hitches were quiet and he kept the car\u2019s speed a sorrowful thing, a fairness paid out inch by inch so the world could not claim it had been rushed into injury. At the far corner, where the iron fence made a sharp suggestion, something came low and quick out of the little white and went to cross with the certainty of a creature which had been taught, elsewhere, that a line drawn by humans was nothing more than a childish mark. It was not a squirrel. The fox moved like handwriting in a language Ulriche could read but never write. Elias put his foot down on the brake with a care that did not make demands of the tires and set his own jaw as if to tell bone and tendon they were responsible for what came next. The fox looked at them, and the look had no accusation in it, only a question, and then it took its own answer away through the cemetery gate and did not look back to see if the people had earned anything from their caution.\n\nHe did not speak again until they turned onto Washington where the plow had been lazy. \u201cI thought it would be small again,\u201d he said, and then, after a minute in which his breath counted ladders between his ribs, \u201cIt is not small. It has a tail that keeps its own counsel.\u201d Ulriche did not tell him that this victory counted as a number in a ledger no one saw; she put one hand very lightly on the seat between them as if steadying a bowl that had been set down full.\n\nDr. Shanahan opened his office as though he had been expecting them and set his hat into a particular dent on a particular hook that suggested a measured faith that even towns can be taught by habit to be kind. He was a large man with a voice that had learned to be gentler than his shoulders. \u201cOliver,\u201d he said grimly when they said the name, and then added a phrase the Irish say when they mean to throw a rope into a well. \u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d He lifted his bag and then another smaller one and then, seeing Ulriche, put both on the counter and took out a blanket and wrapped it around her shoulders as if he were a village for a passing pilgrim. \u201cYou ride in the back with me,\u201d he said to Elias, as if there were no other arrangements possible now, and Elias nodded and moved with the obedient speed of a man who has promised himself a better later for today\u2019s risk.\n\nOn the return, the car discovered the geometry of obligation, which is always a triangle\u2014 the house, the person in it, the person fetching help\u2014 and tried to keep its feet under it. When they went by the park again, the snow lay over everything with impartiality that would have been a scandal if God had made taste instead of weather. Ulriche looked for footprints where the fox had been and saw none, which taught her something about the kind of tracks some beings leave and the kind others do not consent to leave even when it would comfort us. Shanahan looked at her with a sidelong kindness that said he understood more than he said about nuns and roads and men whose hands had decided to be careful forever. \u201cYou have a good man,\u201d he remarked, not meaning possession, and she allowed herself to be warmed by a sentence that would not stand if weighed and yet was exactly the right size for this car at this moment.\n\nThey poured into the sacristy like weather and came out smoothed by the boundary of holy things. Father Oliver allowed himself to be tired in front of Shanahan the way a man will allow himself to be seen by a stranger if the stranger is careful with time. There were tubes and names for winds inside a chest and injections that made warmth remember a path it had given up on. Ulriche stood with her hands joined and did and did not pray, which is the kind of pragmatic disobedience God has loved people for since the first stove was lit. Elias took his hat off and kept taking it off as if discovering again that he was bareheaded and that there was a dignity to be preserved at all costs. When it was time to move Oliver to the car, Elias lifted with the other men and made a sound with his throat that would not have been distinguished by a biologist from a cough, and yet Ulriche knew it for the thing it was\u2014 a reminder to his body that it was meant for bearing weight.\n\nThe hospital smelled like boiled linen and disinfected hope, which is a tolerable compromise in a town that measures itself honestly. Shanahan took Father Oliver in behind a curtain with the confidence of a man whose hands had never betrayed him at an altar or a table. Elias and Ulriche stayed in a corridor where a radiator ticked like an old insect. She remembered a night as a child when her father had come home with his own cough and set his medicine box on the kitchen table and taken out the vials and spoken to them like old friends who sometimes answered and sometimes didn\u2019t. The box had been lined in velvet and smelled like wintergreen; she had wanted to sleep in it, small as she was then. \u201cHe\u2019ll be made easier,\u201d Elias said, and she nodded, and then he looked at his own fingers as if counting what they had learned since the squirrel and since the fox. \u201cI did not hit the fox,\u201d he added, looking as if he were promising it to someone who would not be satisfied with the receipt and would prefer to examine the goods.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and nearly laughed at the grotesque inadequacy of thanking a man for not killing a creature he had never wanted to harm. \u201cYou will not unlearn it,\u201d she added softly, and when he frowned she clarified, \u201cThe feeling you have for the sudden thing that crosses. You will not unlearn it, and it will make you late often, and it will be worth it.\u201d\n\nThey drove back under a sky that had run out of adjectives and settled for being a color that agreed with roofs. The car felt more docile now that it had been made the servant of a rescue and not a threat. At the gate Elias exhaled slowly, a boy discovering he had survived a dive off a rock. He put the car to bed like a horse rubbed down and let his hand rest on the hood a second longer than use demanded. \u201cIf I drive again,\u201d he said, with the shy arrogance of a promise, \u201cit will be for some living thing.\u201d Ulriche almost said that squirrels are living things and then did not, trusting the part of him that would not let himself forget to supply that fact later when the house was asleep and his mind was doing its cruel inventory.\n\nThe days rearranged themselves as days do after a crisis that has not ended but has put on a soft collar. Father Oliver\u2019s bed at the hospital became a place where the nuns took turns being still, which proved to be harder work than the world gave it credit for. Ulriche brought books and did not open them and brought silence and did not fill it, which is a virtue often mislabeled as absence. When she went back to the library the books on the screens were ready to be coaxed into standing like adults, and she set them upright with the ceremony their returned spines asked of her. On one of the endpapers, a child had once drawn a cat whose tail was longer than its life, and the water had blurred it into something like weather, and she stood looking at that cat as though it were trying to tell her something about persistence that had nothing to do with clarity. Maribeth drifted in and put a sheet of paper where Ulriche had left none and wrote on it with her finger. \u201cIt says,\u201d she whispered, though she did not lift her voice above the rustle air makes on paper, \u201cyou are allowed to keep loving with your eyes and not your hands.\u201d\n\nThe fox developed a habit of being seen only by people who did not talk about foxes. Sister Verna believed strongly that it was a saint in a low costume and left bits of laurel at the fencepost nearest the far lot as an experiment in interspecies diplomacy. Bettina snorted and muttered about hens and vowed to make the girls\u2019 crowns tighter next year so no saint, animal or otherwise, could tip a flame in passing. Elias checked the fence for the third time in a week and found places where a fox had taken liberties without sinning, which is a trick not all animals nor all men can manage. When he showed Ulriche the bent wire he had straightened, his hands aligning the world with that stubborn male tenderness tools respond to, she nearly touched his wrist again and then folded her fingers inside her sleeve until they forgot the impulse.\n\nIn the kitchen Bettina took ruthlessness out of the cupboard and used it on turnips, making them obedient to stew whether they liked it or not. She dried rosemary in bundles that looked like soldiers\u2019 memories hung to smoke. \u201cI\u2019ll put it in the marinade for the lamb,\u201d she told Ulriche, as if offering her a treaty rather than a flavor. \u201cChristmas doesn\u2019t care for lavender, and cinnamons have their own committees.\u201d Ulriche smiled and agreed not to argue about herbs with a woman who had taught her more than one lesson at a cutting board.\n\nOn Gaudete Sunday the Mass wore rose, a color that made winter seem like a possibility rather than a sentence. The girls took it as an opportunity to giggle behind the ends of their veils, sniffing the altar flowers like bees pretending to be devout. Father Oliver sent a note on a stiff card delivered by Shanahan\u2019s nurse that said only: \u201cDon\u2019t let them skip the third verse. There\u2019s a hole there that holds the sky up.\u201d Ulriche read it twice and put it in the back pocket of the missal and felt as if she had placed her hand on the small of the chapel\u2019s back. After the service she went to the courtyard alone and listened to the bowl consulting the cold. The ice had learned to go opaque at the center where light was presumptuous. She pressed her skin to it, broke it, and put the shards aside neatly the way a woman puts aside a thought for later with the full intention of forgetting to come back.\n\nElias began to whistle again, a fractured sound repairing itself over the course of a week until there was a sequence that might have been learned from a thrush and might just as easily have been borrowed from a hymn sung badly by someone standing two pews behind him. He did not look at the bowl when he passed it, but he stopped smoothing the burlap around the rosemary as if it were a shroud and started to tuck it as if it were a blanket. \u201cBrother Flint thinks snow is just rain in a coat,\u201d he told Ulriche one afternoon, and blushed at his own complicity with an invention, then went on, stubborn as a man teaching himself a habit he wishes had come with his first teeth, \u201cbut the rats don\u2019t write letters about weather and yet they still come. I set traps. I talk to them apologetically, and then I don\u2019t apologize again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to be tidy about vermin,\u201d she said, and he looked at her as if she had granted him a small indulgence in the economy of his moral bookkeeping. \u201cYou\u2019ll go to the hospital,\u201d she added, daring the suggestion the way a person dares the edge of a pond with a foot. \u201cWhen it is your day off. He\u2019ll want to hear about the cabbages even if he pretends he did not ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him,\u201d Elias said, and then frowned at the ground because he had promised himself not to speak lies even when they were wishes in disguise. \u201cI\u2019ll try. It smells like boiled bones in there,\u201d he admitted, relieved to be base in front of someone who had also been seen by the smell. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to put my hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse them,\u201d she said simply, and then made herself laugh because she had soundly deserved to be laughed at for that foolish sentence and because laughter kept the skin from getting too tight around her throat. \u201cOn the rail of the bed,\u201d she amended. \u201cOn the heavy end of a book if he will let you. On your own knees.\u201d\n\nHe nodded slowly, as if learning to read a long vowel in a strange word. He went that evening, hat in hand, and came back with a patient\u2019s name in his mouth that sounded like something he had been entrusted to carry and not to show off. \u201cHe asked about the compost,\u201d he said to Ulriche in the hall, and then because he had been brave once and seen the world not end he added, \u201cHe said to turn it, rats be damned. He used stronger words,\u201d which made her look at her feet so she wouldn\u2019t have to hold in her face the pleasure she took in the idea of Father Oliver swearing as a tonic.\n\nChristmas Eve was a practical day, which is not how Christmas Eve gets written down in books but is how it behaves in a house that has to make soup for a number that never corresponds with bodies at the table. Bettina stalked through the kitchen with a spoon that had instructed generations of sauces to behave, and Heloise carried her authority like a hot pie, not to be touched by anyone else but meant to be shared. Sister Verna lost the frankincense for twenty minutes and found it again at the bottom of a drawer full of disused laces, which she took as a sign that smell, like God, chose to appear where it pleased. The children were excused from their lessons and made up rituals out of whatever came to hand, wreathing a statue in paper chains and inventing on the spot the tradition that this particular corner must be bowed to for three days under pain of weather, which Heloise permitted on fewer conditions than usual because she understood the economy of indulgence.\n\nIn the late afternoon the snow softened into something the air could lift in handfuls and scatter. Ulriche dressed herself with the care that belongs to the armoring of ordinary things, black upon black, a pin at her collar that had once belonged to her mother and had the modesty to pretend it did not remember another woman\u2019s heat. She stood at her door with the intention of not moving until someone called, as a penance for the pleasure she took in the preparations. Agnes breezed by, made of starch and advice, and then came back as if memory had tugged her veil. \u201cYou will do the reading,\u201d she said, brisk and without asking, and Ulriche felt the words stand up inside her like a small regiment.\n\nShe held the text at the lectern later, and the candle flames worked at their edges like men sawing a plank to fit a stubborn frame. She read with a voice that had been taught to be more obedient than any other part of her, and she found in the old sentences room for meanings that had been left there like coins under a floorboard. \u201cIn the days of Caesar Augustus,\u201d she said, and the boys in the front row thought of roads without knowing why, and the girls thought of girls, and the old women thought of kitchens that had held children and not enough bread and a patience that had saved two lives at least. When she reached the part with the angel, she let herself have the smallest pause, the length of the time it takes a fox to decide whether to cross, and then said, \u201cFear not,\u201d as if it were a thing she herself might do on a good day and not just a performance she was hired for.\n\nThe Mass spun out, a thread that knew its business, and afterward there was the peculiar holiday emptiness that comes when work has held a body upright for hours and relinquishes its grip. Ulriche went to the bowl because there was no other place in the convent where she could stand and be seen by something that did not have rules it thought it had invented. The ice was formed and forming, and she broke it neatly and set the shards aside like fallen host cut wrong. She felt cold in her teeth and thought of Saint Apollonia and smiled at the ridiculousness of a woman who liked symbols putting her mouth to winter as if it were a relic. Elias came into the courtyard then and did not approach the bowl, careful in a new way with the spaces she occupied. He had a small packet in his hand, wrapped in paper that had contained screws and made no claims to beauty. \u201cFor you,\u201d he said, not moving closer because sometimes kindness needs distance to remain what it is. \u201cFor your books.\u201d\n\nShe opened it later in the library under the lamp that made even poor paper look considerate. It was a set of thin, hand-cut wedges of cedar, smooth and smelling like apologies, with tiny clothespins glued to one end. He had made them with a hand that had decided to be precise. A note was folded with them in that difficult, cramped writing men develop when someone once told them their words had better fit into small spaces if they intended to be heard at all. It said: \u201cTo keep them open without breaking them.\u201d She sat with it, with the smell of cedar making the air about her behave like a cupboard, and she allowed herself to let her throat move once as if she had swallowed water wrong. She took one wedge and slid it into a book that had insisted on closing itself as if it still trusted the memory of a flood, and she watched the pages relax like the hand of a sleeping child.\n\nThe bowl froze deep that night and did not forgive her finger\u2019s polite knock. She went to bed and dreamed of a country whose border was the water stain on the library ceiling and whose anthem was a whistle that could not decide whether to be bird or boy. In the dream, Father Oliver walked along the border and then lay down and became it in a way that did not hurt him. When she woke, the candle was out and the dark was behaving as if it had been told that she preferred it. She put her feet on the cold and blessed it for being honest about itself.\n\nMorning moved without asking anyone what they wanted it to be. There were packages on the refectory table that had been wrapped in old maps and tied with the string that had come around potatoes in months when potatoes had not tasted of cellars. The girls had drawn saints on labels with features so fierce they would have frightened wolves and delighted the saints themselves. Bettina had made bread that cracked with an integrity you could hear from the next room, and Verna had found a way to brew coffee that did not offend anyone\u2019s sense of proportion. Elias had set a sprig of rosemary at every place as if it were a social equal, and Heloise had made peace with that in advance because she understood the delicate economy of letting a man think a table was his idea.\n\nA letter came after breakfast, a rare bird on gray paper with the diocese\u2019s seal that had always reminded Ulriche of snakes constrained by good manners into a circle. Heloise read it and put it down and looked for a wall to let her back learn from. \u201cThey are sending us a deacon,\u201d she said finally, and the room\u2019s air rearranged itself because new men make air adjust even when they are good. \u201cFor Epiphany. He\u2019ll be here a while to learn where we put our chairs.\u201d Bettina muttered that chairs moved for no man and then looked guilty because she knew some chairs had been put in a room in the last year that could not be moved and still have the room be what it was. Verna clapped her hands once and asked whether he liked honey, and no one answered because it was a question from a language that would require a dictionary.\n\nUlriche put her head down over the ledger she pretended to keep and felt a small bristle of dislike that embarrassed her. She did not want another man with a cough or a different sort of certainty. She did not want someone to come and stand in the doorways Elias stood in and then be gone again with his shoes full of the dust of their halls. She did not want to share the good burden of reading and of flowers pressed between pages and of small, necessary lies told to old books for their good. She wrote \u201ccandles\u201d three times in the margin and then crossed them out and told herself sternly not to invent a future that had not been invited.\n\nThe fox left prints that evening on the cloister walk, a neat scandal. They stopped where the stone took back its smooth and the snow could not hold any more stories. Maribeth came with her coat open and her breath sincere and whispered, as if they were all in on some age-old secret, \u201cHe goes under. He has learned doors we didn\u2019t tell him.\u201d Ulriche knelt and put her fingers into one track and found the cold there the brave kind, the kind that does not bite until asked. She thought of the bowl, of cedar wedges, of the way men and animals learn to pass through and to stop, and she felt gratitude rise in her like something boiled for a long time on a small burner finally ready to feed.\n\nShe wrote a note to Father Oliver that night, a page longer than she would have permitted a girl in her class. She told him about the fox and about the wedges and about the third verse and how it had held and about the rosemary and about the way Heloise put her hand on the doorframe when she was thinking because the wood had an opinion. She did not tell him she had ridden in a car beside Elias and watched him not hit the fox because it felt like a confession and not a report, and confessions belong to rooms with grates and poor cushions. She tucked the note into the pocket of the nurse with the sober shoes and went back to the library to put another book upright and another and another, whispering to herself the names of saints and herbs and the girls with the hair that made her remember what color means under rules. It was enough, this work, for a night that was supposed to be holy and instead was merely correctly sized for the heart she had and the house she had been given to keep.\n\nIn the first days of the new year a wind began that had answers and no questions. It made the old windows in their long frames go thin with opinion and the doors confess their gaps. Elias wrapped the pipes in the outbuildings with felt like scarves and set bricks against the bottom of the door that led to the yard where the trash had its democracy and the rats had their constitutions. He came to the library at midday with his hands scrubbed and his hat in his fingers and stood almost where he had stood with the wedges. \u201cHe sent a card,\u201d he said, and when she looked at him in puzzlement he added, \u201cOliver. To me.\u201d He fumbled in his pocket and produced a rectangle of thick paper with a cough pressed into the corner like a signature by a second hand. It said, in Father Oliver\u2019s tight failing letters, I was wrong about Cicero. He loved his daughter and the roads. They weren\u2019t roads. They were the way out. Elias held the card as if it had a temperature, and she had to stop herself from reaching to feel it. \u201cHe says it to me,\u201d he said, still bewildered, \u201cas if I had been in the room when the Romans decided things.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were,\u201d she answered, and before he could argue she pressed the card back into his hand. \u201cKeep it. There are some sentences that are loaned to a person and some that need a drawer.\u201d\n\nEpiphany brought the deacon wrapped in a coat too thin for people who did not know him. His name was Rafe, which made the girls snicker and then arrange their faces toward the altar with that ferocious virtue children can summon as quickly as mischief. He was smaller than his idea of himself, which is a workable ratio for men who must survive among women who do not have patience for their monologues but have plenty for their good works. He spoke in the clear, quick manner of someone who had rehearsed humility in a mirror and found it fits if you adjust the shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll be no trouble,\u201d he told Heloise, which was the same as promising to be a kind of trouble that could not be predicted. He liked the library with the imprecise fondness of a man who had been praised for reading and punished for it in the same winter. He shook hands with Elias and looked at the rosemary and said, \u201cMy mother planted some between stones,\u201d and Elias said, \u201cIt survives what would prefer it not,\u201d and they nodded at something that did not require a priest.\n\nUlriche watched this new shape moving through their days and felt her heart tighten its habits around itself and then loosen, chastened by its own rudeness. Rafe had a way of standing aside when she walked by that did not call attention to the fact that he had stood aside, and she remembered herself enough to welcome him with a thin slice of bread cut just right and a sprig of rosemary placed on his plate as if it had always been his. He did not give lectures to girls who did not ask for them, which was a miracle she did not wish to name aloud in case God thought she was collecting them and decided to balance her books. He listened, which is either a trick or a gift and sometimes both, and when he asked questions they were the sort you can answer without being made into a museum.\n\nOne evening, late in the month when weather turns on its heel and pretends it will go before deciding to stay another week just to see if you are serious, Ulriche went to the far lot because Maribeth had sworn by three different forgotten minor saints that the fox had left a different kind of message. The snow lay in small, agreeing drifts and the fence leaned with dignity. There, under the elm that had known three generations of children climbing it and two of men falling out of it, the fox had relieved itself with the narrative richness animals prefer. Maribeth crouched beside it with a reverence that would have embarrassed the bishop. \u201cSeeds of something that came from somewhere we don\u2019t have,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDo you see? He brings what we are not.\u201d Ulriche laughed, low and without fear, and felt how the body can be glad for a creature\u2019s indifferent generosity. Elias came across the lot then, hatless and humming, and stopped at the sight, and then he did something he had not done since the morning he turned over the bowl; he let the tune continue even when he realized he was singing.\n\nLater in the library, when the dark made a small agreeable room out of the world and the lamp drew a circle around the work table that felt like a coven of useful women, Ulriche took out her notebook and turned to a page that did not bear Jude\u2019s name or any other excuse. She wrote without crossing out: The fox\u2019s gift is not the animal itself but the result of its refusal to hold everything in. The gardener\u2019s gift is not what he grows but the arrangement of his care. The priest\u2019s gift is not his lungs but his sentences and the gap he leaves where we put our breath. She stopped, surprised at herself, and then added, with a small fury at the honesty of it, My gift is that I know where the water goes and when to break it, and I cannot pretend any longer that this is an accident. Agnes rustled in the cupboard like a woman rearranging quilts and said without stepping fully into the room, \u201cYou have to stop talking to yourself as if you were a congregation.\u201d Ulriche laughed, obedient for once, and closed the book on her hand and felt its weight, the way a woman feels a child sleeping and knows she cannot move for a while without changing what the night will remember.",

He did not stride where stepping would do, and when he laughed it fit under the beams without making them wonder whether they were equal to the task of holding it. He came into the library with his hat in his hands like a man about to apologize to a room for having to pass through it and set the hat down on the corner of the desk as if it were a delicate argument he did not intend to pursue. He liked the smell of the resinous drying pages and said, with a generosity that made Ulriche forgive him a little for being planted here by people who drew maps on other people\u2019s lives, that he had never seen a place recover its breath so tidily. The children took to him because he knew where his hands were, which is a knowledge few men carry into rooms filled with girls and books, and because when he told them a story he did not keep it on a leash. After a week he asked quietly, as if he were not asking for more of Ulriche than she could afford just then, whether the parish might hold catechism in the library on Tuesday evenings, the winter making it hard to keep small bodies upright in the church when their toes were staging revolts inside their shoes.\n\nUlriche looked at the ledger she had improved by writing in its margins and thought of the hour between Vespers and Compline, which belonged to a kind of quiet that had her name on it, and of the way the library grew a skin in the evenings that could be bruised by talk. Her impulse was to guard the room the way Bettina guarded knives, but Rafe\u2019s question had been asked in the tone a person uses when he is offering his throat for inspection by a dog; it would be cruel to bite. She took the matter to Mother Heloise, whose mind liked to set new habits to the right of old ones and make them promise to keep their hands to themselves, and Heloise nodded and said, with a practicality that loved both children and libraries almost to the point of theft, \u201cYes. Let them come, but not with their boots dripping. We will teach the door to pay attention.\u201d\n\nThe first evening a troop of boys and girls came in with hats like small, respectful storms in their arms and breathing that could not be persuaded to go down as far as their stomachs. Rafe had them lay their mittens on the radiator in a row and recited, with an earnestness that made even Verna approve, the prayer for beginning study as if it had been written specifically for mittens that wanted to be useful. Ulriche watched from behind the desk and counted the number of times her teeth touched when she meant them not to, more often than she liked, because the cold had found a pocket in her jaw and kept its treasures there. She handed out catechisms with the smooth satisfaction of a dealer of cards in a game no one loses and listened to Rafe teach the children the habit of asking better questions than the ones the answers had prepared for.\n\nElias built a little row of cold frames along the wall that faced the weak sun with a stubborn good cheer, using old sash windows he had coaxed out of a shed that had been practicing being haunted. He set their slanted glass against cedar that smelled like things that deserved forgiveness and tucked burlap like blankets and then untucked it to check the sleeping things with the guilty pleasure of a father who claims to be checking only the stove. He waved to Ulriche through the library window with the hand he had not hurt years ago and then, as she returned the wave, used the other hand reflexively to press the cold frame lid down, a habit he had picked up from the fox and from himself. The bowl in the gravel had grown a hairline crack that widened on the bright days and pretended to heal on the dull, the way certain sins do, and she ran her fingers over it in the mornings as if a human hand could persuade clay to mend itself because it was loved. Elias brought another, a shallow earthen dish that had once been meant for a pie and now had a more secular life, and set it beside the bowl with the tact that people use when introducing two friends who might prefer not to see each other but will share a table if they must.\n\nHer tooth began to speak the way a beehive speaks when the air changes. It did not insist, not at first, but then it set up a private industry under her cheek and sent its workers to the door with their small stinging arguments whenever she tried to forget them. At Lauds she felt the Latin slide past and catch on that little place of pain the way a thread catches on a nicked nail, and she closed her lips around the word because saying it would have rattled the hive. Bettina noticed, as women notice everything that matters when not invited to, and said, with her spoon lifted as a scepter, \u201cClove for it,\u201d and then added, because she could not refrain from a fling at the other truth, \u201cand Shanahan if clove behaves like poetry.\u201d\n\nUlriche put a clove on her tongue and let it burn, polite in a way that illicit heat is polite, and at first the pain turned under its blanket and slept. Then, one cold morning when the bells came in close like geese and her breath distributed itself unevenly through her chest, the tooth opened its window and let all its aching out at once. She knelt in the chapel and tried to remember Saint Apollonia\u2019s face from the print that had hung in the hall when she was little, the one with the tongs and the calm smile, a sort of domestic courage, and said without teeth moving, \u201cAll right,\u201d which is a prayer that admits both defeat and the kind of victory that happens when a woman knows where pain is going and invites it to meet her halfway.\n\nRafe, who had learned in a week that every woman in the house would rather someone be useful than empathetic, found her wrapping a strip of linen around her jaw like a modesty and said, in the tone of a man offering directions he is willing to walk himself, \u201cLet me take you to Shanahan.\u201d He blurted it and then blushed because in his eagerness not to ask Elias he had made himself the sort of man who hustles a nun to a doctor like a cousin and not a colleague. Ulriche would have said yes to anyone at that hour, and the thought of Elias\u2019s knuckles white on the wheel, the long carefulness of him, made her both calmer and more afraid; the two emotions shook hands inside her and therefore she said to Rafe, who had hands built to lift doctrine rather than a woman\u2019s discomfort, \u201cAll right,\u201d and he bobbed his head as if he had been named temporary road.\n\nThey went in the convent\u2019s own car because it had found humility once and did not imagine itself equal to any speed a man might favor. Rafe drove the way he had learned to read\u2014 careful of the margins, deliberate at the commas, slowing for anything that might be a clause. He talked in little segments that he assured himself were useful because silence had a way of suggesting to people that priests were thinking about their souls instead of about potholes and the necessity of the tires. \u201cShanahan\u2019s kind,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has a pocket in his coat for pain and it leaves wearing a different hat,\u201d and she nodded because if she opened her mouth she would be found out by her own breath.\n\nThe waiting room smelled like the coats of people who did not talk to one another in public and liked it that way. Shanahan\u2019s nurse had a competence that had defied three generations of sorrow and taught two boys not to speak unless asked. She tapped Ulriche\u2019s wrist once, as if telling her that the body would be returned mostly intact, and then led her in to the room where the dentist\u2019s chair faced the window and the winter and a maple that thought it had seen everything. Shanahan himself put a wide hand on the back of the chair as if introducing it to her as a patient old horse and said nothing until the instruments had made their small due announcements to the air. He peered into the place that had made itself the center of her and touched with the gentleness of a man who has always loved women\u2019s mouths for their voices and not their shapes and then nodded gravely as if at last he had found the name of something he had suspected.\n\n\u201cIt must come,\u201d he said, and she nodded, and Rafe, who had his eyes honestly closed as if giving her privacy and himself the illusion of not being complicit, nodded too like a man listening to a hymn he does not know all the verses to. Shanahan\u2019s hand was heat and hygiene. There was the peculiar intimacy of a man asking for a woman\u2019s trust with a steel hook in his hand and her consent making the room an honest place. He spoke to the tooth as if apologizing in advance for being good at this particular cruelty. \u201cForgive me,\u201d he said to any saint listening, and Ulriche thought, with a ridiculous steadiness, that it would be just like God to forgive the man while letting the small white thing go without benediction.\n\nThe pull was both a relief and the most insulting moment of the season. It made a noise like an old wardrobe confessing it had been shut too long, and then there was in her mouth a sudden removal of a very specific weight she had not known she had been carrying. She tasted the proud bright of blood and the medicinal cotton that pretended to care and closed her eyes on the unhandsome prickling that came when the body agreed to be improved by pain. Shanahan put the thing into a small white envelope with a propriety that surprised her and then, as if he had seen that she intended the odd ritual of wanting to hold her own vanquished part, he pressed the envelope into her palm with a tenderness that made Ulriche think briefly of those men who hold their children once with awe and afterwards with competence.\n\nShe walked out with Rafe into the winter and the air was honest with her about every edge. Rafe did not speak until they were in the car and it was breathing again like a good dog, and then he said, carefully because he was a man who could think two things at once and not be made visibly ill by it, \u201cApollonia would have approved of your stubbornness,\u201d and Ulriche, whose mouth welcomed that saint\u2019s name too fully, laughed and then put her fingers against the cotton and scolded herself. The road back had the charity of familiarity, and when they passed the park, it was only trees and fence and a paper cup blown by any wind\u2019s democracy, and Ulriche understood that fear has to take its turn like anybody else at a gate. She leaned her head back and watched the small trapped condensation make missionaries of their breath against the glass and thought of Elias\u2019s careful foot on a pedal and the way his cautions had turned into a kind of faith.\n\nShe did not keep the envelope long. In the garden, when dusk had learned the names of the shrubs and was therefore refusing to leave politely, she went to the rosemary that had survived the apprentice winter and knelt on the gravel like a woman proposing and not expecting to be accepted. The earth was hard and did not pretend otherwise. She lifted a little crust of it with a spade as if uncovering a story told badly and set the envelope in as though it were a seed that would sprout something that would not embarrass anyone. She covered it and smoothed it with a palm and the ridiculous pleasure of making anything straight and then spoke aloud, because the bowl had taught her that sometimes speaking to inanimate things is a kind of sense, \u201cYou can have that bit, then,\u201d and the rosemary, which did not answer, smelled like a memory she would prefer not to stop having.\n\nWhen she rose, Elias was there on the other side of the cold frame, his hat pulled low in a way that made the top half of his face seem private and his mouth public, which embarrassed them both. He looked at her without the hungry attention of a man seeking a reason to be involved and with the steady attention of someone who has learned not to flinch when another person steps into their own hurt. \u201cAll right?\u201d he asked, and she nodded, and then, because the space in which they stood had never been quite so tenderly honest, he added, \u201cI\u2019m glad you went.\u201d She would have said that Rafe had driven her, that Shanahan had pulled, that Apollonia had smiled terribly, but he was not asking for logistics. She lifted her hand and showed him her palm as if the lines there might have recorded the extraction and he would nod in the manner of a man who understands maps.\n\nThe wind stood up that night and remained standing to prove it knew how. It came down off the river with the confidence of a relative who has never been refused a meal and rattled the cold frames and found, with an impudent finger, the one knot in the burlap that had been tied by a woman thinking about a tooth and not the perfections of twine. At Matins the walls agreed to hold. At two the glass spoke to itself in its thin tongue and at three a plate from Bettina\u2019s shelf did not. Ulriche lay awake and listened to the old hierarchy of sounds\u2014 pipes pleading, beams negotiating, Agnes turning over phrases in the wardrobe and choosing to keep half for morning\u2014 and then the wind addressed her specifically under the sill and she smiled into the pillow because of the ridiculousness of being flattered by air. She rose, put the shawl around her in the way women have learned that makes their hands free without losing heat, and went into the courtyard because the rosemary had adopted her tooth and it seemed only fair to stand guard at its small inheritance.\n\nThe burlap had come loose and was now performing a dance taught back in goat-days, flapping in a measure that the rosemary did not know the steps to. She caught it and the wind made a sentence out of the cloth and her arms, leaving her feeling, briefly, like a flag. The sky had the sort of cloud that looked like something mothered only long enough to be put down again, and snow came at her with reasonable arguments. She knelt to retie and the twine, which had been spun by someone in another winter and stored in a drawer that held buttons and a single pencil, resisted in the way of all cordage asked to become form. She blew on her fingers in that old, good superstition and spoke nonsense after them and tied one knot and then another, a seaman under a bad moon.\n\nElias came through the arch without a sound the building considered polite. He had no coat on over his shirt and his eyes were the exact color of returning to bed. \u201cDon\u2019t scold me,\u201d he said softly before she could scold him, \u201cand I won\u2019t scold you,\u201d and they knelt with the burlap between them like a reluctant altar. He held the loose end with a competence that never raised its voice and she formed the loop as if she were writing a letter to someone who insisted on being surprised by the post. The wind tugged at them like a child dizzy with sleep, and she shifted, and his hand came, orchestrally, to her wrist because the knife in her palm had slipped and a finger that worked in the library had no business being made foolishly shorter in a garden in January. He didn\u2019t even say the word careful, but it was there in the angle of his thumb and in the way he surrendered the space back to her once the loop had admitted the knot\u2019s teeth.\n\nThey finished and sat back on their heels without taking their eyes off the thing, as if it had been a horse that had consented not to run and might reconsider. Their breath made brief small worlds at the height of their mouths. He said, after a minute that did not advertise the hour, \u201cBrother Flint told me this knot once,\u201d and she laughed soundlessly because the Twosday man with the clacking teeth belonged now to both of them with equal parts of irony and sincerity. \u201cOf course he did,\u201d she said, and then felt suddenly a sweep of relief so wide she would have fallen into it if she hadn\u2019t had the gravel under her knees to remind her about proportion. The rosemary exhaled because it had been startled and then told a better story about why, and they went inside by separate doors with the gentle, ridiculous solemnity of people leaving the scene of something that had not happened and yet had.\n\nIn the days following, Father Oliver\u2019s cough wrote smaller letters. He sent notes down with Shanahan\u2019s nurse, who took off her outer patience coat just outside the door every time and left it on the peg like a good, heavy garment. Once the note said only the word warm, as if he were trialing adjectives the way people trial little spoons of stew to see which one the season prefers, and once it said, with the off-brand humor he carried like a flask, Anything that has a third verse should also have a fourth. She sent him back a library stamp on a scrap of paper and the date due, which made him laugh enough to produce an occasion he pretended was unrelated in his handkerchief. Elias went every Thursday now, and his ears had learned the geography of the hospital corridor in a way his heart had not, and when he came back he said fewer words but they weighed more, which is a trick only certain men and all good stones manage.\n\nRafe did not get in the way of any of this, which is a sentence that recommends him even to people suspicious of temporary men. He took the girls to the far lot and held the chalk while they wrote the year and the initials over the door, explaining with a seriousness that did not require belief that the letters stood for both names and a prayer and a sentence that sounded like a benediction. He watched the fox\u2019s path with a particularity that suggested he had known other creatures who knew where to put their feet, and when Sister Verna asked him for some complicated permission involving honey and saints and a cupboard, he listened and said yes, knowing that whatever he had authorized he would hear about later if the honey behaved like a sacrament all over the linens. He asked Ulriche once, in a corridor, whether there was a patron for librarians, and when she told him that there were too many to choose from and therefore the sensible thing was not to decide which one was supposed to be holding up her roof, he nodded as if she had expressed a doctrine he could repeat in a pulpit without getting in trouble.\n\nThe fox learned the hour of the bells and the minute before them. Sometimes Ulriche would catch a sliver of it through the glass like a piece of burnt orange thought, an idea of warmth moving through cold with too much grace to be suspected of theft. Once, when she bent to pick up a book whose binding had turned old without becoming brittle, there was a small shock in the room like a clock consenting to go again and a scent that had no right in winter\u2014 cracked apple, mouse-nest, the brief, indecent breath of wild. Maribeth raised her head from a stack of cards and whispered, \u201cUnder the gate\u2014 he can make his ribs like lace,\u201d and Ulriche thought of her own ribs and of the rib that had once been removed to make a woman and how many versions of that story human creatures keep inventing in their houses and their minds.\n\nMara appeared as if the fox\u2019s name were an invitation to children that this was a day when poems would be understood more than usually. She had a paper in her hand and a little crack in her lip from the weather and the kind of patience people reserve for long trains and good bread. \u201cI wrote one about the bowl,\u201d she announced gravely, and read, with the breath control of a nine-year-old soprano, \u201cBowl in snow, a hat for sky, a place for birds to check their faces, thin as frost and twice as brave.\u201d Ulriche applauded with her fingers against her palm and felt her mouth weight ease a fraction, like a thing that had been balancing and decided to be held by gravity again just this once for a friend. \u201cThat\u2019s not how bowls are,\u201d Mara added, as if anticipating criticism by men who keep warehouses of nouns, \u201cbut it\u2019s how they wish,\u201d and Elias, who was passing with a coil of hose he would not use until April, said, \u201cYes,\u201d in a voice that made the new deacon look up and learn, in an instant, where in the syllables of a gardener a person should not place uninvited weight.\n\nSnow loosened around the edges of the beds like a collar unbuttoned at last. The cold frames sweated politely in the mornings and showed Ulriche a hint of green no one had ordered from a catalog, which made her think of all the things the earth keeps under its tongue to pull out in company if the conversation lags. She lifted a lid when Elias was not looking, because she had promised herself to be a woman who sometimes disobeyed small instructions in order to remain honest, and the warmth that rose was almost obscene, like catching someone\u2019s shoulder without warning and discovering they were human. Tiny seeds had split themselves and were thinking hard about what to do next. She put the lid back as if protecting the tender trouble of too many possibilities and went away with the feeling in her hands of a secret that would bear telling, but not yet, because some announcements need to be born with their coats on.\n\nAgnes continued to be wherever Ulriche needed to be corrected and nowhere she might be thanked. \u201cYou are walking about with your mouth unbalanced,\u201d she hissed one afternoon from the broom closet, and Ulriche said, with a bright about-to-be-true tone that she had learned from men who argue, that she was entirely balanced and wholly oriented and her mouth was behaving like a saint. \u201cFewer dramas,\u201d Agnes countered, rustling as if through tissue paper on which a gown had been folded for thirty years, \u201cand more washing of cups. Don\u2019t make me have to warn you about hope.\u201d Ulriche, who was a woman who could hold more than one thing in her hands at once, was both irritated and grateful, and she cleaned the little cups people had thoughtlessly abandoned on the window ledge because forgiveness begins with being annoyed and bending anyway.\n\nWhen Father Oliver returned at last\u2014 not recovered but rearranged\u2014 he came into the chapel by the side door with the small noise of a man asking very much to be allowed to sit down. He wore his blanket around his shoulders as if he were an old prophet who had given up prophecy and taken up grammar, and the girls turned toward him with a relief they were too good to make a show of. He had less of him in some places and more in others. His eyes had gone wide again, a boy\u2019s in the face of an animal he has never been permitted to keep, and he took Ulriche\u2019s hand and put it under his and then on top of his and then took it away, as if reminding her that this franchise would be revoked later and she ought to enjoy it now. \u201cThe roads,\u201d he said, because the body carries its last argument into all rooms, \u201care not for leaving, they\u2019re for returning,\u201d and she nodded and did not tell him that these, in Salem, were often the same action.\n\nHe asked her to read, and she read for him with her voice, and then he asked Elias to tell him about the heap and whether it steamed properly even in weather that would have persuaded a less purposeful pile to forget what warmth was. Elias didn\u2019t step forward, because he was not a man who took three strides into any man\u2019s breath for a conversation unless summoned with a hand, and he spoke from his proper distance and said, \u201cIt remembers itself,\u201d and Father Oliver laughed until he coughed and then laughed because he had coughed and then coughed because he had laughed, and everyone behaved as if this were not a circle that should be broken with two kind hands. Rafe stood at the back and watched the old priest\u2019s mouth move around words that cut roadways in the air and did not try to step on them or improve them with gravel, which made Ulriche like him a little better and then feel immediately ungracious for keeping such a ledger.\n\nThat evening, when the bowl wore a new thin plate and the fox\u2019s path had chosen a wilder geometry across the far lot, Ulriche went out with a kettle and poured a ring of hot around the cold and watched the cut widen itself with the theatrical patience of a good cloth being torn and then folded neatly. She felt all her little losses settle like birds on a wire that had been strung for exactly this purpose and thought of teeth and pins and small, proper envelopes and the one knot in the burlap that had chosen now to be the stronger because someone had tied it with their mind inside their hands and not spinning out ahead into fields of if. The bells began to speak to the evening as if it had not been here before, and she stood long enough for her breath to be mistaken by a passerby for someone else\u2019s. Then she went in with the kettle emptied and set it upside down to dry and wrote on a scrap of paper: \u201cWe keep what we can by giving it to the right part of the ground,\u201d and tucked it into the crack in the wall where she kept ironic prayers and a list of people who would understand being kept in a wall.",

                              "content": "Chapter Eight\n\nCandlemas came down the calendar with both feet, bringing with it the sense that winter, having proved its point, could be persuaded to share its tools. Beeswax surfaced in drawers where ordinary days never asked for it. Bettina unrolled bundles of candle-sticks with the air of someone taking a dowry out of long storage, sniffing the sweet fat smell with a look of professional suspicion that anything could be so obliging and not be plotting. Rafe practiced the blessing in a voice that did not yet have the dust of old incense in it and therefore was as clean as a new floor. The girls, who had evolved within a week from skeptics about throat-candles to connoisseurs, argued quietly about which pair would make their coughing grandmothers safer without being showy. Ulriche kept inventory of wicks and thought, with a small pleased ache, that there are mercies made to be lifted and mercies made to burn.\n\nThe bowl had split all across one side as if it had considered being a moon. Ulriche found the crack with her thumb one morning and felt in her chest the unreasonable sense of betrayal that comes when an object refuses to be more than an object. Elias bent over it with the gravity of a man considering where the river goes under the town. \u201cI can stitch it,\u201d he said, almost sheepish, as if confessing to a spell learned in a different school. \u201cClay can be persuaded with little staples if you know how to apologize with metal.\u201d He fetched from the shed a cigar tin with a family history of screws and bent nails, and in its bottom he found the short, fat lengths of brass that had once married a garden urn back to itself. \u201cYou make holes like ears,\u201d he said, touching the clay not yet, \u201cand then you give it a reason to stay.\u201d He looked at her as if asking permission to hurt a thing in order to keep it, and she nodded, because she had already walked past that argument with her own mouth.\n\nThey set themselves on either side of the dish like parents doing the surgery fairest to be shared. He drilled with a hand drill that had belonged to a man dead long enough that any etiquette around borrowing his tools had become habit. The noise was small; the clay powdered and smelled like something dug up that had been waiting to be found. Ulriche held the bowl steady, feeling through her skin the stubbornness of fired earth resisting renegotiation. They put in the little staples, two-pronged, and bent them shut with the flat-nosed pliers that had known every species of fence. The bowl winced and then relaxed. \u201cShe will always remember,\u201d Elias murmured, the old pronoun he hadn\u2019t meant to use sneaking out anyhow, and Ulriche smiled because it was exactly the sentiment one might have about a jaw without a tooth. When they were done the bowl bore a line of stitches like a scar on a saint\u2019s relic, indecent and honorable at once. They set it down and filled it and watched a thin wet thread appear at the seam and make a small pilgrim\u2019s trail down, then hesitate and stop as if a decision had been made by a committee of water and brass. \u201cIt will leak on its own schedule,\u201d Ulriche said. \u201cWe\u2019ll learn it,\u201d and he nodded, relieved to discover that some failures were simply new habits in good light.\n\nThe fox, which had lately become a punctuation more than a presence, began to leave its marks nearer to the kitchen door. Bettina found a rind of cheese on the step one morning with a bite taken out of it that would have shamed a human child, and she stood with her hands on her hips and declared\u2014 as if it surprised anyone\u2014 that no animal would be forgiven that considered the pantry its parish. \u201cHe has sense enough to pray where God hears him,\u201d she groused, and went inside to put wire on the bin that held the waste a fox would call groceries. Elias made a lid out of a piece of board that had once been a shelf for hymnals no one liked and a rock that had once been part of a wall that no longer remembered what it had held. \u201cHe can have the far lot,\u201d Bettina conceded, narrowed eyes pinned to the place where the path from wild to kitchen would be if animals believed in maps. \u201cHe cannot have the step.\u201d Rafe looked at the prints with the interest of a man who had not yet been tested by anything larger than a dog and said, thoughtfully, that sanctity might travel on small feet. Bettina flicked her dishcloth in a motion that could be translated as yes and no and then returned to her stew, which did not respect philosophy.\n\nOn a Tuesday evening in the library the children arrived with the crisp of cold in their hair and the dampness of their mittens making a daily river on the radiator. Rafe had them say the prayer and then, because he had discovered that any group of children would give you their attention if you gave them a secret, he told them that St. Blaise had once saved a boy from choking on a fishbone, which had nothing and everything to do with throat blessings. Mara\u2019s hand went up as if it were attached to a string only she could see. \u201cWhat about words,\u201d she asked, earnest in the way of girls whose mouths have already learned to run faster than their sense of what cannot be retrieved, \u201ccan they choke?\u201d Rafe opened his mouth, shut it, opened it again, and said, \u201cOnly if you swallow them when you mean to say them,\u201d and the girls smirked at one another and the boys filed the sentence away to bring up years later when some woman spoke and they preferred she didn\u2019t. Ulriche held her eyebrows in the position that said children were not to be given weapons disguised as advice and changed the subject to prophets with good hair and terrible habits.\n\nIt was later, as she was putting away catechisms and tucking the cedar wedges back in their tin like sleeping fish, that the small fire happened. Jory O\u2019Rourke, who had a pocket that loved matches and an attention that hated anything that lasted longer than his breath held, had been demonstrating to Benny Sanz the principle by which an empty matchbox, scrubbing itself on the tongue of the striker, could be made briefly brilliant and then turned ash without ever asking permission. The trick went on without adult notice until the box, tossed toward the wastebasket with the aim of a boy who has been praised for less, landed in paper that did not like boys. Elias, passing by the glass on his way to put away the broom he had made seem noble, saw the slick lift of flame like a fox tail and did not knock; he came through the door with his hand already set to take heat. Ulriche had a pail because she always had a pail when paper was in the room. They put the fire out with the humiliating efficiency most fires deserve, a dark smear left on the edge of a bin like the memory of too much enthusiasm. Rafe held Jory by the shoulder with that gentle, unshakeable hand he had learned from older men who had been obliged to be kind, and spoke to him about being entrusted with his own flint. \u201cFire wants work,\u201d he said, and Jory, who would be a man with a good or bad back depending on whether he was given something worth lifting soon enough, nodded with the sullen sincerity of the almost-repentant. Mara looked at the singe with the superiority of a poet who had not written about flames yet. Ulriche patted her pockets for the smell of what had almost happened, relieved to find only the old lives of cedar and ink.\n\nThe next morning she woke with her voice not where she habitually left it but down behind the left side of her throat like a coin that had rolled under a bed. It was not missing, just elsewhere, and when she tried at Lauds to fetch it, it came up reluctantly, as if testing whether the day was worth the climb. Agnes materialized in the sacristy like a useful superstition with a solution and thrust into Ulriche\u2019s hand two candles bound crosswise with a scrap of blue cotton that had once lined the baptismal basin. \u201cHold,\u201d she commanded, and for once Ulriche did exactly what she was told, pressed the wax to her neck in the traditional shape, offering her small inflammation to an old story. The warmth found its way in, refused to be pushed out by rules, and her skin briefly believed in everything. Rafe raised his hands over her in the general blessing with a humility that made the candles behave. \u201cBy the intercession of Saint Blaise, bishop and martyr,\u201d he said, the words good in his mouth, \u201cmay God deliver you from all ailments of the throat,\u201d and Ulriche felt the old faith travel like a shiver to the part of her that liked to sing at the wrong hour. Father Oliver, who was wheeled in to the chapel in a chair that had agreed not to squeak out of pity, held his own throat with exaggerated solemnity and winked at the smallest of the girls, who almost dropped a candle bowing in reply.\n\nAfterward, in the courtyard where the bowl wore its stitches like jewelry no one would ever buy for fear of flattery, Elias held his hand out without asking for hers and the candles returned themselves to him obediently because they understood what it meant to be held by a man who knew the burn of instruments and the absence created by a tooth. \u201cI have another present,\u201d he said, embarrassed by his impulse and bolstered by a success that had been measured in a dry library days ago. He reached into his coat and brought out a little roll of gauze tied with string. Inside, when she opened it at his nod, were four pieces of old spoon handle, sanded and glimmering, flat like tongues, notched at one end. \u201cTo lift pages,\u201d he explained, face reddening as though good words were blood and privacy was skin. \u201cWhen your fingers are damp. I saw the nurse use one on Oliver to hold his cheek and thought\u2014\u201d He did not finish because decency has its borders. Ulriche thought of her tooth under the rosemary and her wrists tied in winter to work that needed the exact pressure she had and felt, in her chest, something float that had been willing to sink. \u201cThey will be used,\u201d she said, and put one under her tongue briefly out of a superstition that would have scandalized a bishop.\n\nThe fox had taken to sitting very still in the late afternoons at the fence line as if committing to memory which households had balsamic vinegar and which homes only pretended to. Maribeth reported, in the tone of someone issuing a bulletin no authority would thank her for, that it had a white spot on its left hind foot like a coin of approval. Verna, who had decided the fox was a visitor from some Old Testament closed on a Thursday, insisted they should give it a name and then tried on three or four\u2014 Basil, Crispin, some obscure bishop whose sainthood had been achieved by survival rather than miracles\u2014 and gave up when none fit, calling it Fox as if that were honor enough. Bettina baited the rats with a grim affection that made Ulriche think of old aunts tying ugly bows. \u201cIf he stays at the fence,\u201d Bettina conceded like a woman releasing a captive idea in a meadow, \u201che may watch. If he comes to the step I will make a parable that ends unpretty.\u201d\n\nThe days stretched on. There were small works to be done, which is the proper way to carry sorrow. Ulriche oiled the hinges of cabinets that had complained twice and therefore had earned patience. She rethreaded the drawstring in a sack that had been sulking for months. She taught Mara the trick of holding a page down with the pad of her finger below the text instead of on it, and Mara nodded gravely and then, privately later, invented a way to do it with her sleeve that pleased her more. In the afternoons Rafe read from the Acts of the Apostles with a surprise that suggested he had not known how much was built on people making decisions in rooms with bad windows. Father Oliver slept. On Thursdays Elias went to the hospital and learned the sound of the elevators and the way the nurses\u2019 shoes spoke to tile and came back with his hands shoved in his pockets, which is how a man carries news he is not sure someone wants. Ulriche asked, when asking did not sound like a demand, whether Oliver had smiled, and sometimes the answer was yes and sometimes the answer was a silence accompanied by a look at an object in the room that did not belong and would have to be moved later.\n\nOn the day the beeswax was blessed and the boys learned what a thurible weighed full, Salem thawed and then reconsidered. The sidewalks glistened like plausible arguments and the roofs gave up their scabs with noisy regret. The bowl leaked gracefully, its small confession making a wet halo in the dust. Ulriche found herself humming again by accident, the sound a measured thing like a seam being set straight, and she checked herself only because Agnes popped her head out of the wardrobe like a jack-in-the-box that had read Holy Rules and shook it once, that small economical reprimand that was mostly an invitation to be stubborn. \u201cYou\u2019re not a kettle,\u201d Agnes scolded without words, and Ulriche, who had decided this year to answer less often the voices that could not be thanked, smiled and went on taking out of drawers the sticks of wax that would become the procession. She noticed she had started to prefer the honey-colored ones to the pure white, which might have the makings of a philosophy if anyone had time.\n\nShe took an hour toward evening and walked the far lot in a loop that had become a path only in her mind. The snow had settled into its own limits with the practical humility that earns respect. The elm flung its gray fingers. The fox\u2019s track stitched across and then stopped abruptly at the fence, which made her consider all the things that go under and all the things that jump and how rarely the two kinds of creatures envy one another. Elias was at the cold frames, lifting a lid with the guilty care of a man checking on a sleeping baby who is not his. \u201cI\u2019ve started basil too early,\u201d he admitted cheerfully, as if confessing to the weather would give him an indulgence. \u201cIt will sulk and then surprise me or it will just sulk.\u201d Ulriche bent and inhaled. The air under the glass was thick with the small audacity of green. \u201cWe\u2019re all too early in something,\u201d she said, and he looked as if she had spoken to him about a specific and named expansion of his heart, which was rude of her and also not.\n\nCandlemas itself had that right balance between circumstance and kindness. The candles shone without arrogance. The children, unpredictable in all seasons, were solemn as ships. Rafe lifted the bundle of throats and symbols high, his face briefly the face of a man whose life makes sense because he believed it could if he used proper words at proper moments. Father Oliver\u2019s eyes shone wet, whether from smoke or love or pain that had put on clean clothes for the day, and he held the ends of a ribbon that someone had tied around the prayerbook to make it look like a wrapped present. Ulriche sang in the small place where a woman may sing without becoming a sentence other people have to deal with, and her voice was the right size for her mouth again and not a size larger that would have tipped the day. Elias stood in the back, hat in hand, as if he had come to buy a loaf and decided it would be a poor exchange not to watch a mystery he had not ordered. When the blessing of throats came round to him he bent a little, awkward as a saint learning to sit in a new chair, and let the crossed candles dress his neck with a temporary gentleness. He did not look at Ulriche, which made it easier for her to watch him. She thought of the fox\u2019s tail and of the thread of water along the bowl\u2019s seam, of the thin coppery line of blood in her own mouth two weeks ago, of all the things that cut and are forgiven but never wholly forgotten, and found her throat given over to heat for a moment that no one would mark in the register.\n\nNews came down the wire, which had decided to be reliable that day, that a storm considered grand by people who named storms would work itself up the coast in two days\u2019 time. Bettina made lists that had more to do with the geography of a pantry than the psychology of fear. Heloise walked with her keys in hand, the way captains stroll the deck before a weather that pretends to be an agent. Verna lined the jars of honey up by height again, because order could be suggested to squalls if you were polite. Elias tied down what had the decency to be tied and spoke to the lids of the cold frames in the same tone he used to talk to young boys inclined to test the strength of their bones. Ulriche laid out rope in the hall and towels near thresholds and counted the buckets that had the sense not to leak. \u201cThere\u2019s a seam in the south roof over the schoolroom that translates to a scandal in the corner,\u201d she told Elias, and he nodded as if she had given him the diagnostic language a man prefers to a woman\u2019s sigh.\n\nBefore the weather arrived in its official capacity, there was a day of odd light, the sky as though rubbed with flour. Mara presented Ulriche with a new poem written in pencil that had bitten through. It concerned foxes and saints and a small bowl that thought itself the moon and behaved accordingly. Ulriche put a star sticker on her cuff even though the girls were too old for that kind of approval and watched Mara take the poem back and crease it carefully as if to encourage the words not to flee. Jory O\u2019Rourke brought her an apology in the form of three straightened nails. \u201cFrom my Da,\u201d he added, as if provenance mattered to guilt, and Ulriche took them in both hands as if they were eggs and said that the library liked contrition that could be used.\n\nThat evening the wind rehearsed, making the ash at the corner bow and then roll its shoulders as if warming up for a dance it both dreaded and treasured. Elias came to the library door and stood with his cap in his hand, which had become a way of saying: I am not here to take anything, only to report. \u201cI\u2019ve put the sand by the east steps,\u201d he said, \u201cand the shoveled paths will become lies in the next hour, but I\u2019m telling them the truth now while it matters.\u201d Ulriche nodded. \u201cThe bowl?\u201d she asked, because some priests ask after souls and some women ask after dishes, and both questions matter in their way. \u201cI set it under the bench,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will still catch. It has moved into a new office.\u201d He grinned quickly, his mouth making a shape that could be stored against a day when the sky was too strictly practical. \u201cIt will leak in the dark,\u201d she said, and he shrugged, the economy of a man who knows you can\u2019t keep everything covered. He left the doorway with the regret of someone who has learned how much thresholds like to keep.\n\nWhen the storm made its announcement, it did it with a suddenness that made the corners of the house look up. Snow came in sideways, not wishing to meet anyone\u2019s eyes. The old tree by the garden made a noise like an animal being persuaded to stand. The new deacon, who had been waiting to prove something to someone without spilling anything, put on boots that had learned the shapes of other men\u2019s feet and went to help Elias throw salt like a benediction at places where bodies would insist on being. Ulriche stayed near the library because if water came down again it would come down here and she had promised the books in some intimate grammar she did not quite know that she would be present next time catastrophe tried the latch. Agnes rustled in Rookery fashion in the wardrobe and had the good sense, for once, to select sentences that sounded like hooks and gave them to Ulriche to grab with her free hand. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the weather,\u201d Agnes reminded her, which is the sermon the devout need most, and Ulriche grinned in the dark and said aloud, to make a pact with whatever listening thing wanted to be fed, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nAt the worst of it the power went down and stayed there like a child under a table after a long run of being asked to apologize. The house made its own small noises. The candles did exactly what they had been told two days ago they would be asked to do. The girls pretended not to be frightened and then were not. Heloise walked through the refectory with a light held high and made of herself a moving chapel, and people cheered without raising their voices. Bettina produced soup in a defiance that may actually have held the building together by its smell. Elias came and went and appeared at one point in the library with a rake and his hair full of the kind of white that makes women adjust their tone. \u201cTrees down in the far lot,\u201d he said, as if reporting on a parishioner who had taken it into his head to go dramatic and then thought better of it. \u201cOne against the fence. The fox has retreated to story.\u201d Ulriche held the candle very still and passed him the matches and did not ask him to stay; she had learned at last the difference between requisitioning a body and making room for one.\n\nIn the morning there was the image of a world re-written for a day, all mistakes forgiven and all spelling altered. The library had not taken water. The bowl had done its under-bench duty and saved exactly the amount of melted edge that could remind a person that collecting anything is only a postponement. The cold frames had survived with the dignity of ships that reach port ungainly but upright. The elm had dropped two large limbs into the far lot like a lesson. Elias and Rafe went out with saws and a rope and the good manners of men who had learned to speak to weight, and Ulriche watched from the cloister as they worked, the one bending to the ground with the confidence of someone who could lean on it and be caught, the other learning to let his knees do that old practical prayer. The fox\u2019s track came, incredibly, under the fence and along the lee of the wall. It paused by the bench in a print that looked like punctuation and then went on. \u201cHe knows our habits,\u201d Maribeth whispered, delighted at the inappropriateness of the intimacy.\n\nLater there was the blessing of throats again because Heloise had discovered a law in her heart that repeated good medicine. The girls lined up and did not look at the boy whose fire had tried library, because this was mercy\u2019s day, not anybody\u2019s correction. Father Oliver, wrapped like a word not to be squandered, lifted his hand in a version of the old blessing that had the shape of his younger arm in it and the weight of his older lungs. He put the crossed candles to his own neck last as a man does not play favorites with his own body, and when it was done he waved a thin piece of wax at Ulriche and made his mouth at her as if he were telling her a joke about Romans he was too tired to speak. She came and took the stub and put it in her pocket and found there the old envelope in which a tooth had once ridden to the garden and smiled at the ridiculousness of a life heavy with small precise objects.\n\nThat evening, with everything fastened and the worst done, Ulriche went into the garden with her kettle for the sake of ceremony and cracked the thin new lid on the bowl that had been stitched. It held with its proper leak, making its little signature on the stone, a line like a vein. Elias came then to the other side and sat on the bench, his hands open on his knees, empty in the way that means they are ready and not famished. \u201cYou do that even when it will freeze again,\u201d he said, not a challenge, only a man asking to understand a liturgy that had begun before his hiring. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t kindness to water, it\u2019s a note to myself. There will always be something to pour into.\u201d He nodded, because now and then a sentence found him like a tool finds its own barn door. They sat until the small birds came and did their numbers and left, and then she stood and he did too, not at the same moment but as if a breath had gone between the two movements and left them improved.\n\nWhen she went inside Agnes was on the landing like a badger pretending to be a tea-kettle. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you are not the only librarian his hands have wanted to fix a thing for,\u201d she snapped, and then, almost tenderly, as if giving a child a coin for a fair, \u201cand also don\u2019t punish him for being new to something you think you invented.\u201d Ulriche, who had started this year to run out of patience for being scolded by her own undomesticated mind, laughed into the dim and went up to the library where the cedar wedges sat in their tin and the spoon-tongues lay like small promises. She took one and set it into a book that had closed itself obstinately all day and watched the page lift a fraction, an obedient pupil in a room where light knew where to sit. She hummed without permission and let the hum be a small weather none of the rules would notice.\n\nAfter Compline, when the house let itself whisper and the hall with the saints leant in to become a corridor of good gossip, Rafe stopped by the door and asked, in a tone that would not force any heart\u2019s hinges, if he might borrow a book on bees. \u201cNow?\u201d Ulriche asked, amused and warmed, and he grinned with that unconcealed hope young deacons have when they find a new set of nouns. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve promised to preach about wax as obedience and I need to be saved from my own metaphor.\u201d She handed him a slender volume that smelled like a summer that had been put to bed properly and he slipped it under his arm as if it were a small instrument whose case had been lost. \u201cYou\u2019re doing fine,\u201d she said, and he looked startled, laughed, shook his head at the boldness of a library pronouncing on a man, and then made her feel generous for thinking the compliment true.\n\nSnow gave up steadily, honest as a confession said to the right person. The roads darkened and then held. The fox became once again rumor with proof. Father Oliver learned to climb the altar steps with his hands around the rail and his breath placed upright in his chest like a chair set back into its corner. Bettina decided rosemary belonged in the bread and not only the lamb, a concession that made Ulriche unaccountably happy, as if the kitchen had acquiesced to a secret she had been keeping in plain sight. She buried two more small things under the green\u2014 a button from her cuff that had cracked like an old song and the matchbox Jory had given her in apology, empty now and therefore virtuous\u2014 and did not tell anyone about the little thicket of objects growing under that herb, because privacy has its own sacrament.\n\nIn March, the first day that was not spring but understood it, Mara burst into the library with hair almost too bright to be contained by any institution and announced in a whisper that tried to be a shout, \u201cThere are kits.\u201d She had the look of a woman thirty years hence telling her friend something she had learned too late to be useful and entirely in time to be interesting. \u201cBy the old elm,\u201d she added, \u201cthey are exactly small,\u201d and Ulriche bit her lip and put her hand longingly toward Elias\u2019s absence and then pulled it back and looked for Rafe, who could be trusted not to put the gratitude of a large man near a den. He came at once, because he had suspected all day that the world had set aside something for him to see if he had the grace not to turn it into an anecdote. They went out with their bodies held small and their eyes open as one opens a letter one has already written in a different life. By the root of the elm, in a fold the wind had not seen fit to rough up, three little foxes made themselves into exclamation points and then commas and then a single brief hyphen as their mother put her mouth on each head in turn without moving anything more than necessary. Ulriche felt a heat in the cup of her hand as if the sight had put something there she could not carry long, and she closed her fingers briefly, pressing the fiction into the truth, and breathed out without sound. Elias came up behind them later, from another path, moving in the way a man moves who knows now how not to be a threat even when his boots are proof of him. He stood at a decent distance and smiled once and then did not smile again because joy prefers fewer witnesses.\n\nThat night, because the day was not big enough for all of it, she wrote in her little book without crossing out: There are things we are allowed to see because we have learned how to hold our breath while looking. The bowl holds though it leaks. The rosemary keeps the small cemetery I make under it without asking questions. Elias\u2019s hands have become a way for me to understand how walls confess when they are asked to stand for others. Rafe has not offended any angels this week. Agnes is the noise a conscience makes when it is being useful. Oliver breathes like a road repaired at last, a little ugly and exactly right. When she raised her head, the lamp had made a thin frost of light on the window that could have been mistaken for a map. She did not draw a line on it with her finger the way she would have when she was twelve. She folded her hands instead, not like a saint but like a librarian closing for the night. Outside, the fox crossed where it preferred, and the bowl, stiched and good, wore its wet aureole like a halo caught doing something ordinary.",

                              "content": "Chapter Ten\n\nAsh came down into the house like a remembered recipe, simple and unforgiving, and Rafe learned the weight of a thumb full of soot as it met the foreheads of girls who had been practicing solemn for this exact ten seconds all morning. The words were the same as they had been when she was a child and her father\u2019s hand had smelled faintly of mint and his box of powders while he traced dust on her brow and made it significant; dust to dust, as if the sentence had the good sense to return to the word it began with. Father Oliver pronounced the phrase from his chair with a tolerance for both ceremony and lungs that made Ulriche proud of his stubbornness and ashamed of her own impatience; he made the word dust sound like a friend returning in good order from a long road with the boots taken off at last.\n\nIn the library the ash left its own arguments on the windowsills where fingers had leaned, thin prints like signatures written by a creature that preferred to be everywhere and nowhere. Ulriche wiped them with a cloth dampened with vinegar and thought, not for the first time, that there are substances that only agree to be removed when you talk to them in their mother-tongue. Rafe came in later to count the catechisms as if numbers could be persuaded to teach themselves to behave, and he asked her, with the caution of a man newly in love with metaphors and already half-afraid of them, whether it was wrong to find comfort in a season that everyone else described as deprivation. \u201cComfort is just the absence of flinching,\u201d she said, and he nodded as if he had been given permission to treat his body like a good neighbor whose name he had finally remembered.\n\nThe fox, which had become plural and then very precisely three, learned the hours when the garden belonged to its kind of hunger. To watch them was to accept that some goodness arrives before it has earned its place; the kits tumbled with the idiotic courage of small things who haven\u2019t met the first wall that will tell them the height of their own legs. Maribeth assigned them names privately and then forgot two on purpose, because to name is to claim, and some creatures belong more strongly to the mouth that calls them Fox than to any smaller name that fits a single head. Bettina, who had made peace with a wider category of disasters than foxes, stacked the bin-lid with the finality of a decree and made up with her clatter for the tenderness she insisted she did not keep in a cupboard.\n\nElias\u2019s whistle, broken and then repaired like a barn hinge, returned without apology, ordinary enough to be unnoticeable by anyone not already listening for it. He had given up looking through the glass for the foxes when he was with Ulriche, perhaps out of a suspicion that their persistence belonged to a world he should not be congratulated for, and instead he made a habit of speaking into her threshold. \u201cThe frames sweat,\u201d he reported one morning, a sentence that could have been a moral in another book. \u201cThe basil sulks and then thinks better,\u201d he added, and she nodded as if he had told her a story about a child who was learning to apologize first and then not at all without forgetting the trick.\n\nOnce, between Vespers and Compline, when the day had taken to putting itself away and forgot where it had laid its own edges, Sister Agnes caught Ulriche by the arm with the old good pinch of women who have been given authority only in fingers and insisted on using it. \u201cYour throat is better and your voice believes you again; do not use that as license to preach to yourself,\u201d she scolded, and then, because she had come through enough winters to suspect mercy when it stood close and pretended to be pushing, she kissed Ulriche\u2019s cheek as if marking her for a kindness she would later deny had to be planned. Ulriche laughed and then went straight to the library and placed her hand on the row of bird books because the plates still made her breath go out of her with the same involuntary fondness she would have afforded a child caught standing on tiptoe with a jar of marmalade.\n\nThe bowl, neatly stitched and vain of it, had found a schedule no one else had agreed to but that everyone obeyed out of a recognition that certain leaks are the world announcing its continued effort rather than its collapse. Every morning she broke its thin habit and set the shards aside like good shards, not to be sentimental about but to take pleasure in as the proper result of a day intersecting itself. Sometimes the water did not show up in its chosen halo for an hour and then appeared all at once as if someone had removed a finger from the hole in the world, and once a robin attempted to bathe in that damp signature and then reconsidered the proprieties of it and went to the rain-barrel where the water forgot itself more easily.\n\nThe first heavy rain came the way new grief does, indelicate and loud, a thing that keeps you from your tasks rather than a thing you take with you while doing them. The far lot filled with honest puddles that held sky long enough to make the sky doubt its own sincerity. One of the fox kits discovered water by falling into it and then learned balance by getting out with a dignity that would have been comic if anyone had dared laugh in front of a creature old enough to be embarrassed. Mara wrote a poem about it with a line that made Ulriche stare at the floor so she wouldn\u2019t have to look generous back at the child, \u201cWe are all mostly puddles with a fox deciding to learn us.\u201d She stuck a star to the inside of her own cuff to remind herself that Mara\u2019s line had been properly noticed and then forgot about the sticker until Bettina found it in the wash and gave it back to her on the end of a spoon like a relic.\n\nOn a Friday when the wind put its elbows on the sill and invited all talk to be brief, the diocese sent three men who wore their clothes like letters of introduction. They came to look at the roof and to look at the books and to look at the room where the roof and the books and the women had been living together in what could be called a state or a sacrament depending on whether you liked the smell of old paper. Heloise stood with her keys held low, pointing toward the floor like a promise and a threat, and gave them names of boards and dates of repairs and the honest arithmetic of costs that refuse to become smaller when you write them in red pencil. The youngest of the men asked Rafe if the library ever had visiting hours for donors, and Rafe said, in his gentlest considered voice, that the poor were always visiting and the books liked them, and the man wrote something and then crossed it out because there are remarks that you cannot put in minutes without discovering you have lied.\n\nElias came in by accident then and became immediately the sort of problem men like to solve with other men\u2014 a worker without formal affiliation, a pair of hands that could be priced if one insisted. One of the suits asked him whether the frames would last, and Elias said, \u201cThrough a truth-teller of a frost? Yes. Through a liar? No,\u201d and the man laughed as if he had been made to, which is a kind of social success but not a moral one. When they left, Heloise sat down on the second step because it was hers and rubbed her hands on the knees of her habit as if, by friction alone, she might create enough heat to burn the paper with the sums on it. \u201cWe will need a fair,\u201d she told Ulriche, which is how women have been saving things for centuries without getting credit, and Ulriche nodded and began to write a list in her mind of which cupboards could bear being asked and which cupboards would have to be flattered into compliance.\n\nFair preparations existed at exactly the point where holiness and capitalism cross the street and pretend not to know each other. Bettina took butter out of the future and put it into the present with a competence that impressed even the mice. Verna invented a cordial from rosemary and lemons that tasted like something you would be told in a confessional and then told again at a kitchen table when the company was chosen correctly. Maribeth rigged a fishing game with magnets that made the boys believe briefly in machinery again. Rafe, who could be useful if you handed him a purpose with handles, built a blessing booth with a curtain and a box for prayers the way a man builds a cradle who has known children but not the exact one he is trying to convince. Ulriche organized books into stacks that would forgive being sold. She made a table of treasures without covers, brought back from near-drowning and now proud of their new, softened shapes, and propped them open with Elias\u2019s spoon-tongues so their bravery could be recognized.\n\nThe fair day arrived full of weather with both opinions and mercy. Heloise stood at the gate with a purse like a principality and greeted people who had grown up and then softened; everyone in town comes to a convent fair not for bargains but to be forgiven discreetly for having asked what things cost in other rooms. Children were turned loose like birds with names pinned to their jackets in case a storm took them. Sister Agnes ran the white-elephant table with a cruelty that saved people from themselves; she would put her hand on an object and say no, not for you, and then, after a pause long enough to teach a lesson, yes, perhaps only for today. Rafe blessed the rosemary bundles so many times that the plant began to get ideas about its vocation, and Bettina sold bread that cracked with its own authority.\n\nElias made himself smaller than he was in the way men do when they suspect the shape of their usefulness might embarrass anyone with a hat. He had built a stand out of old doors for Ulriche\u2019s mending demonstration and stood in the shade of it pretending he had other errands. People came with their old books like children with knees to be bandaged and stood quietly while Ulriche explained in a voice that had been sized correctly by Candlemas how to lift a page that wanted to cling and how to let paper breathe without shafts of showmanship. She used the cedar wedges and the spoon handles and the tin of paper like a magician who disliked applause. Once, when her thread tangled itself into an opinionated knot, Elias reached in from the edge and offered the end back to her without their fingers meeting, and she felt the relief along the length of her arms as if someone had loosened the laces of a dress that had been behaving.\n\nIn the afternoon there was a moment when music arrived without warning. Mara\u2019s uncle brought a fiddle and tuned it with the authority of someone who has lived long under trees, and the sound made the air remember what it had been doing before there were roofs. Men clapped in that old, absent-minded way good men have when their hands are called upon without sin. The fox made a brief row of prints at the far edge of the gravel, which everyone pretended not to notice except for Maribeth, who cried in the private, efficient way of a woman who has practiced and hates herself for it. Father Oliver sat in a chair near the bee-loud corner and let sound find him. When the tune turned into a jig by accident, he laughed once, and it startled a few people who hadn\u2019t remembered he could, which was worth the price of all the lemons.\n\nToward the end of the day, just when the sugar was deciding it had had enough of being obedient, a boy\u2019s shout cut a piece out of the afternoon. Jory O\u2019Rourke, with his pockets full of nails turned respectable by the fair, came running as if he had caught fire again. \u201cThe kit,\u201d he said, keeping his story wound tight by fear, \u201cfell\u2014 back by the well\u2014 between the stones\u2014 he\u2019s wedged,\u201d and the phrase flared out, a panic named in a way that made men turn toward shovels in their minds. Elias looked once at Ulriche and then away and moved with that new good pace of his, the one that did not involve speed but always arrived when it should. Rafe, to his credit, did not volunteer to take charge but followed, pulling aside two boys by their sleeves with that gentle nonnegotiable force good deacons learn from old women.\n\nThe well at the far edge of the lot had been retired with dignity years before and given a flat stone as a lid because the desire to fall is a human one and the convent had no need of extra metaphors. But the fox had no respect for human safety beyond what his ribs had taught him, and a space no wider than a plate had offered its bad invitation. The kit sat down in darkness and decided to wait, which is a strategy adopted by creatures with better teeth than humans. They could hear the small, unscandalized sound it made, as if it were not in trouble but merely interrupted. Elias lay flat on the ground without confessing to his back and slid his hand between the stones until his fingers were a different color, searching with the coward-courage of a man who will not let his grip hurt. The kit\u2019s fur met him like a sentence, and he closed his hand just enough to find the scruff that mothers use. He looked at Rafe, who had the good sense to be looking at the ground and not at Ulriche, and said, low, \u201cPush the top stone up a prayer,\u201d which is a unit of effort known in certain churches and gardens. Rafe leaned his weight, not with the vanity of a lifter but with the grammar of a man acquainted with levers, and the stone allowed a finger\u2019s width to become a thumb\u2019s.\n\nUlriche put both hands on the edge to hold the afternoon still. She said nothing because words are size-specific and this moment had already assigned itself adjectives. The kit passed up through air like a pun, silly and perfectly placed. It shot out onto the grass with embarrassment and insult in its small body and then, because no one had laughed, paused and turned, put its nose on Elias\u2019s thumb for the briefest learned courtesy, and was gone in a diminuendo of legs. Bettina would later claim to have seen the mother nod. Rafe crossed himself with the gesture of a man who has found the limit of his willingness to find God in everything and would like, for one evening, to be relieved of the obligation.\n\nAfter, when the tables were put back into versions of themselves and the jars counted and the coins scraped into Heloise\u2019s principality, Ulriche sat on the bench by the bowl as a series of small operations settled in her mind into the shape of a day. Elias stood near and counted his breathing as if it needed to be told that it was forgiven for being fast. \u201cI have learned how to remove a thing from a small dark,\u201d he said finally, not to be praised but because he needed to hear it once in a room that didn\u2019t echo. \u201cThat\u2019s the trick of this house,\u201d she said, and could not help the laugh that rose like a pan boiling over, \u201cthough we tend to throw in more candles and fewer foxes.\u201d\n\nThe ledger next day proved the town could be made to love what it pretended not to notice. There was enough for the roof to be mended and for the library to have a new gutter that would make old rain feel valued. Heloise put her hand on the paper the way a woman puts her hand on a sleeping child\u2019s chest to be sure of its argument and let her shoulder drop a fraction. She came to Ulriche with that rare, maddening kindness that made Ulriche feel she had not earned anything and said, very plain, \u201cYou will go to the city with Rafe on Thursday and fetch the used shelves from the parish of St. Constance; theirs have been given money and ours will be given wood, which is the better arrangement if you ask anyone sensible.\u201d Ulriche blinked. She had not driven, would not drive, and the last time she had sat in a car with a man she was still peeling meaning off the sides of it. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will bring shelves.\u201d Heloise nodded as if that had been the sentence the day had been waiting for and added, as if she had been forced by some ancient rule to include a thorn, \u201cAnd Sister Agnes will go with you,\u201d which made Ulriche both safer and more anxious in the way an extra blanket does.\n\nThe trip to the city happened under a sky that had learned how to be polite again. Rafe was better at driving than at most other things and worse than he thought at saving the sighs of the engine from embarrassing themselves. Agnes sat in the back as if she were the queen of an empire that had decided to travel incognito and made small noises at corners as if to signal that the angle of turning had offended a minor saint. Ulriche watched the hedges and did not look for foxes because there are some creatures who belong to the vocabulary of a particular street. Rafe talked in little folded packets about how the shelves would improve the library\u2019s lines and how the parish of St. Constance had once mounted a puppet show for Epiphany that had made three bishops write letters and two old women reconcile, and Ulriche let his words ride beside the car like a proper accessory.\n\nAt St. Constance a man with a waistcoat that had survived two political parties met them and showed the shelves as if they were paintings. They were dark with varnish that had learned its own opinions and they smelled of rooms where confession had been brandied into something permissible. Ulriche touched the wood and felt under her fingers the soft depression where other fingers had pulled books down and set them back and pulled them again. Rafe and the waistcoat man discussed bracing and the traveling of weight over years. Agnes inspected a dowel with an expression a dean might have worn at a composition full of passive voice and then, grudgingly courteous to inanimate improvements, allowed the men to lift. Ulriche stood aside where she could carry ends and watch knuckles without acquiring any, and for the first time in days she felt a rest in her chest as if her ribs had been assured they were doing exactly what they ought.\n\nThey loaded the shelves into the convent\u2019s truck and tied them down the way one ties promises one intends to keep even if one suspects one has exaggerated. On the way back, the city having done its work of reminding them that a convent is a way and not a place, Rafe took the lower road by the river because Agnes had once said out loud that the upper road made her think the sky had leaned too close and he had taken her at her word and built a route of it. As they passed the park where the squirrel had reorganized Elias, Ulriche looked deliberately at one bench and then at another like a woman learning to discard a superstition by keeping a ritual. There were no squirrels visible, only a man asleep under an important newspaper and a woman standing as if she had the sun on an invisible leash, and Ulriche felt both alarmed and comforted by the normalcy of it.\n\nThey arrived as the light practiced for evening. Elias was in the yard with his sleeves rolled because sleeves should be rolled whenever anyone with a conscience handles a shelf. He took the end of the first tall section from Rafe with that economical respect men learn when they have been warned by their backs, and they walked it in together like a guest whose temper was known. Ulriche went ahead to clear the space where the shelves would live and, for a moment, the room appeared to her as a body arranged with its own good sense: a spine here, a lung there, a long arm reaching from the old parish to this one, placing along the way every book that had forgiven water and boys and the odd rat. She stopped for breath not because she needed it but because the sight had the courtesy to allow her a pause.\n\nThat night, as the bowls of soup told their steaming stories and the girls argued quietly about whether saints had preferred desserts, Father Oliver asked to be brought to the library. He had not asked for anything grand in weeks and therefore had earned a derrick of attention to lift a smaller wish. They rolled him between the aisles like a ship that had learned to recognize its harbor by the smell more than the shape, and he put his hand on the new shelf and patted it twice as if to teach it the rhythm of his heart. \u201cThey will forgive our backs,\u201d he murmured, as if the wood were a thing that could be persuaded to make moral concessions, and Ulriche thought, with the suddenness of a woman corrected gently by a pleasant truth, that he was not talking about lumber at all.\n\nLent lengthened and then began to come to its senses. The girls learned a hymn they disliked in a key that made Sister Verna look pious by accident, and Rafe discovered a penitent who wanted to confess that he had, for years, told people he liked marmalade when in fact he did not. Bettina made soup out of nothing and then again the next day out of less than nothing and refused to be thanked in a tone that was obviously a request to be thanked properly later. The fox kits grew into their ears and then into their feet, and once Ulriche caught one sitting like an old general in the spot of sun where the fence lost interest and forgot its point, its head tilted as if it were considering writing a letter to the editor.\n\nA letter came with the seal that made Heloise\u2019s mouth set to a practical grimace. It announced a visit from the bishop, who was fond of speaking as if he were at the beginning of time and time had just whispered its name to him. He would come the week after Easter, though the letter pretended it was a surprise to everyone, and he would say some words and eat some bread and count the chairs with his eyes without appearing to. Rafe, who had not met a bishop who did not smell faintly of something unrepeatable, practiced not saying what he thought already with some grace. Agnes brought out a tablecloth from a century when tablecloths had corners that made their own arguments and declared that she would not be ironing for any man who had not learned to bend his own back. Ulriche thought of the bowl and of the repairs no one but water would care about and decided to brush the invisible dirt off the lip of the world.\n\nOn a day when the sky had finally decided to turn white into blue without needing an audience, Maribeth came in to the library with a stack of papers and the look of a woman who once thought she had lost time and then found it under the bed. \u201cYou asked for names of the emigrant girls that first year,\u201d she said, laying down the stack as if the paper were hot on the underside. \u201cI found them in an old ledger that refused to admit it was a ledger and pretended to be a grocery list for the souls of children.\u201d Ulriche picked up the first page and felt her stomach move in that sober happy way it had when a piece of something larger turned in its sleep and showed its back. Names ran down the paper like a litany taught by someone who didn\u2019t know he was teaching and therefore had the good luck of sincerity. The girls had been Agnes then, and Mary, and Flor, and Vita, and a single Carmen who had had the temerity to insist on remaining Carmen in a town that did not expect such an honor. Ulriche ran her finger under the list as if under a seam and breathed in, gently, because paper had decided today to hold more than ink.\n\nIn the evening, after the girls had been taught not to put their thumbs in the wax by letting them put their thumbs in the wax, Ulriche went out to the rosemary and knelt with her small spade. The ground had the give of a body that had decided to forgive you quietly. She planted three little S of something Elias had given her without ceremony\u2014 sage, the boys making their jokes the way sputtering lamps do, and then being shushed. Under the rosemary lived the tooth and the button and the matchbox and a little pile of what, by now, had become more than a list and less than a story. She smoothed the earth and told it, in a voice she had learned from women who reassure children without making them stupid, that it would be asked again and it would answer again and regrettably that was life.\n\nElias came through the arch with the same pace he had learned for bad news and then had wisely kept for good. He did not sit. He did not stand too close. He held out a paper with the sort of modest pride a man reserves for something that cannot be confused with strength. \u201cI have a license,\u201d he said. He meant the hospital\u2019s permission to drive their old van for errands that had their own timelines, the document with dates and an officious signature and a weight out of proportion to its rectangle. He had returned to the road, in daylight and on purpose and only when required, and he had not hit anything that had not deserved it. Ulriche took the paper and did not read it, because the content was obvious and the formality a kindness to be let alone. \u201cYou kept your slow,\u201d she said, and he nodded and then, with a bravery so embarrassed she loved him for it beyond her rights, said, \u201cAnd I kept my fox.\u201d\n\nHoly Week unrolled like a cloth that had seen too much. There were practices and basins and the old embarrassed intimacy of men washing men\u2019s feet and pretending to speak solely to God. Rafe preached a short sermon with the long point that pain arrives dressed like work and leaves dressed like rest. Father Oliver bit his lip at a verse and then let it go like a man who knows what he can carry and what he must pass to smaller, steadier hands. The children decided that Judas must have been tired, which is a dangerous thought to give children because they will take it with them into rooms where it will be mistaken for permission. Ulriche sang where she was asked and kept the extra verses folded in her throat for later in case someone with keys called for them.\n\nOn Easter morning the yard did not spring, it permitted. The bowl held. The fox kits sat like commas, necessary and briefly decorative, and then were called by their mother into the paragraph. The basil, long offended, consented to become leaves. Bettina made eggs scrumbled into a promise without the show of it. Heloise smiled the smallest smile anyone had seen on her face and let it stay there for the length of an Our Father. Rafe\u2019s alleluias came round and did not require defense. Elias stood beyond the door and turned his hat in his hands and then did not come in and then did, which is probably the way the door would prefer it always.\n\nIn the afternoon, when the children were left off to run and the girls, who were not children but were not yet anything else, went to write letters with words they could not entirely be expected to mean, Ulriche took down a book on saints who had made gardens and found herself surprised by the number of men who had needed to talk to cabbages. She leafed through, the old gleaned Latin buzzing gently like a hive, and thought, with the relief of a person who has found a river running under a city, that maybe she was not inventing as much as she feared. Agnes came and stood in the doorway as if she might be a sermon and then was simply a woman with bad knees. \u201cYou will let him carry for you when the shelf is too high,\u201d she said, and then, before Ulriche could make either of the three errors available to her, added, \u201cand you will carry what is yours when he is tired. There are no medals for the exact proportion. I have looked.\u201d\n\nThe bishop arrived as announced; there are men who are their announcements. He had a pleasant, tidy smile he thought would not be held against him and a ring that drew the attention of even the children who had been told jewelry was a vanity and then given holy cards with gold on them. He said sensible things, which is an underrated talent in men with hats, and did not inspect the pantry. He praised the library and said the word resilience as if it had been taught to him by people he now intended to honor retroactively. He noticed the stitch in the bowl without assuming it was a metaphor, which almost made Ulriche forgive him for being the sort of man whose sentences rearranged money.\n\nWhen he was gone and had taken with him the small eddy of criticism that follows men who have been called father by very many, the house went back to its size. Elias brought a handful of seeds he had carried in his pocket so long they smelled like the inside of his coat and said, in the tone of a question that is not a request, \u201cBeans?\u201d and Ulriche looked at his hands and at the grounds and at the year and nodded. They planted in a thin line that looked, from the window, like a margin note, and when they were done they watered with the delicacy of friends who have been invited to put their hands on a sleeping baby\u2019s head. The fox watched from the fence as if it were considering the agricultural policies of a new administration. The bowl leaked its signature in the same place as always.\n\nThat night, when the bell made its last careful announcement and the girls had been counted and the soup put not away but into another day, Ulriche wrote in her small book without crossing out: It is possible to love like a bowl loves, with a crack and a schedule and no apology. It is possible to stand at the lip of a well and learn what belongs to the dark and what can be lifted; it is possible to let a man\u2019s hand hold the scruff of a day and not insist on the ceremony of tears. It is possible that obedience, properly understood, is a knot tied in wind, not for tying people but for keeping blankets on them in a certain draft. She blew on the page as if the words were varnish and would harden usefully and then closed the book on her palm as if her hand were a page. Outside, the kits argued briefly that the moon had been made selfish and the mother answered them without moving more than her tail, which calmed the whole lot of them in the only way that ever works. The rosemary kept its small cemetery without comment and the beans slept with the proper arrogance of things that know themselves to be food and flowers both, depending on the hand.",
