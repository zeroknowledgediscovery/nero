     "novel_text": "On most mornings in Stoughton, before the lawn sprinklers cough awake and the commuter rail shrieks past the mural of the founding farmers, Nell Hardwick is already out, lacing the light through her strides. The sidewalks are uneven at the turns near Central Street; tree roots have lifted the cement here and there, making the whole loop into a small obstacle course only a local would dare to take at a clip. She knows every dip, every patch of shadow, where the smell of pine turns to warm bread when she gets within a block of Dovetail Bakery. On clear mornings like this one, the bakery\u2019s back door is propped open, letting out cinnamon steam and a clatter of trays like coins.\n\nNell measures her breaths to the rhythm of cracked pavement. When she runs she counts, not numbers but triggers\u2014mailbox, stop sign, elm, bench, war memorial, pothole that tried to ruin her ankle last winter. Counting keeps her brain from trying to make lists. It is too early for errands, or for hearing the voices, one of them her own coach\u2019s, telling her that a runner is only as good as her last season, that the 5K is all about patience and the mile is elegantly cruel, that the 10K is a conversation with pain, all of which fuels her when she wants it but keeps her awake when she doesn\u2019t.\n\nShe waves at the bakery as if it were a person, because for seven months it has been. Dovetail, with its brushed steel counters and faults in the floor where the old ovens used to sit, is where she learned\u2014hesitantly, and then in a jolt\u2014that you can be good at something stupid. It started as a dare, one of those wobbly nights last fall when her calf was wrapped in ice and a day\u2019s worth of foiled training had turned into a humiliating nothing. She was washing dishes for a fundraiser at the bakery, up to her elbows in suds with Ivy, her sister, across the bench stacking tins like suitcases, when a guy with an apron the color of egg yolk shouted that they needed one more body at the counter.\n\n\u201cThis is not my scene,\u201d Nell muttered. She had flour on her cheek that she could feel but not find.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just plates,\u201d Ivy said, flicking a piece of lemon zest at her forehead. \u201cOr maybe they want you to be the strong arm. Lift a whole pie tin with your mind.\u201d\n\nAt the counter the owner, Vera with the clipped gray hair and an ear cuff of tiny stars, had smiled into the roil of voices and banged a bell. \u201cWe\u2019re doing an empty-the-rack challenge,\u201d she told the room, not looking at anyone in particular because she was looking at everyone. \u201cFor charity, so if you have robust appetites or a competitive gleam, put your names down. Ten dollars to enter. Winner gets bragging rights and a free pie. Most slices down in five minutes. It\u2019s silly. It\u2019s for fun. No sprinters\u2019 starts, no elbows.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, you,\u201d someone had said, pointing at Nell. \u201cRunner girl. Try it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIvy,\u201d Nell had hissed. \u201cDon\u2019t even.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say it,\u201d Ivy had said, all innocence in her eyes and a smirk in the corner of her mouth. Ivy, twenty-four and reckless in the way people are who have never fallen the wrong way on a wet track. Ivy, whose hair was always escaping whatever tie she used on it and whose earrings never matched. Ivy had already turned to the sign-up sheet with the clumsy marker and written NELL HARDWICK in block letters that did not look like Nell\u2019s hand at all.\n\nNell had sighed in a way that seemed to climb up out of her bones. The air smelled like nutmeg and like the rag she\u2019d wrung out too many times. She could have said no. She could have peeled off her dish gloves and slipped out the back door into a night where rain made halos around street lamps. But the feeling was like the warm-up lap before the gun, a buzz that carried a kind of signal her body knew even if her mind didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cYou know I run on vegetables and coffee,\u201d she had told Ivy, who handed her a paper bib that said FIFTEEN and looked inordinately delighted.\n\n\u201cYou run on spite,\u201d Ivy had said. \u201cAnd pie\u2019s a fruit. Some of it, anyway.\u201d\n\nFive minutes later there was sticky on her wrists and filling at the corners of her mouth and she was laughing. She hadn\u2019t meant to, but there\u2019s an absurd joy in bending your face toward a plate in a crowd of other faces doing the same thing, in the ridiculousness of buzzing lips against sugar, of trying to swallow while giggling. She figured she\u2019d be out after two slices. The crust flaked perfectly and the apples were tart enough to make her eyes squint, but that wasn\u2019t it\u2014she found a rhythm. A bite, two chews, chase with water. Breath through the nose. Bargain with her stomach as if it were a stubborn roommate. Her body, trained to obey the metronome of splits, found the drumbeat in a new song.\n\nShe won that night, to the scandalized delight of Mrs. Dalrymple from two doors down, who had given her the kind of frown that only thin people earn from older ladies who think they should eat more casserole. She won, and then she didn\u2019t know what to do with that win because it didn\u2019t fit the self she carried like a backpack\u2014Practical, Focused, Somewhat Exhausted, Runner Girl. That was how the second dare became a third and then\u2014well. Dovetail had become Saturdays where she\u2019d practice some absurd maneuver like dunking the crust edge in water to soften it without her lungs catching on the wrong swallow. She had become a person with secrets she kept in the back of the pantry behind the protein powder.\n\nShe didn\u2019t tell Coach Marta. How do you go up to a person who wears a stopwatch like it is a wedding ring and say, \u201cBy the way, I discovered that when the pies are blueberry and the temperature is under seventy degrees, I can knock out two full rounds in ten minutes without feeling like an overturned boat\u201d? You do not. Not unless you want to be told a long story about glycogen stores and sabotage-by-sugar. Ivy knew, of course. Ivy had started making her \u201ctraining lunches\u201d even though calling them that made both of them laugh. Oatmeal and slices of melon for morning runs; a bottle of water with salted lemons stuffed into it; sometimes a square of cornbread if they were going to be out past noon. On the days Nell experimented at Dovetail, Ivy sliced cucumber into a bowl and set it on the table like a peace offering. They don\u2019t say grace in the Hardwick house anymore; they say be careful.\n\nThat morning, as Nell cut past the war memorial with its bronze soldier stoic toward the road and his back to Main Street, her phone thrummed in the pocket at the small of her back. She let it ring the first time. Second ring, she slowed to a jog, then a walk, then a halt under the heavy shade of the elm that always dropped seed pods on her head in June. The number was unfamiliar. She swiped instead of tapping because her thumb was a little slick with sweat.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d she said, flatly, because she always sounded annoyed when she was panting.\n\n\u201cNell Hardwick?\u201d The voice was clipped and cheerful in the way of someone who has talked to ten strangers already this morning and will talk to forty more before lunch.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Ambrose Weller from the Commonwealth Pie-Off committee. We met briefly in March at the qualifiers in Brockton. Ms. Hardwick, first, congratulations on placing fourth. Second, I know it\u2019s short notice, but we\u2019ve had a dropout. One of the finalists is out with a dental infection, unfortunately. It\u2019s a mess. Would you be open to taking the slot at the finals this Saturday?\u201d\n\nNell was acutely aware in the next two seconds of the birds in the elm arguing about whose branch was whose. A truck rumbled past on the main road with an unsecured ladder banging against its side, every hit like a drum. Somebody\u2019s wind chime a block away trilled a tin melody. In her mouth, her mouth, the word delicious curled up like a cat. She tried to be sensible. The runner part of her, that schoolmistress with a whistle, said, absolutely not; are you kidding; you have your own race in Providence next month; what would coach say; who is Ambrose Weller anyway and why is he so chipper.\n\n\u201cI\u2014hold on.\u201d She pulled the phone away and stared at the sky. Her heart was already beating like a rabbit from the run, but this added a bright layer, a top note like eeek. She put the phone back to her ear. \u201cSaturday?\u201d\n\n\u201cSaturday afternoon. Two o\u2019clock start. Warm-ups a half hour before. Riverbend Fairgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cRiverbend?\u201d That was an hour away and full of dust. It wasn\u2019t her scene but it was a scene, with food trucks and hand-lettered signs and kids running with balloons until their arms ached.\n\n\u201cYes. Can I put you down? You\u2019re our next qualified, Ms. Hardwick. If you can\u2019t do it I\u2019ll go to number five.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do it,\u201d she said, and then laughed at the way it came out, too fast. \u201cYes. Yes, I can do it.\u201d\n\nAmbrose was already smiling in his voice. \u201cGreat. I\u2019ll e-mail you a packet in an hour. There\u2019s a call for all final participants on Thursday night to review rules and arrangements. Congratulations again.\u201d\n\nHe hung up before she could ask about what it paid or whether she needed to bring her own hand towel. She stood there under the elm, the leaves moving over her like hands, and told herself not to jump. Then she jumped anyway, both feet off the ground, a runner\u2019s hop that called every tendon into service.\n\nShe ran home with the grin stuck to her face, only slowing at the corner where Mr. Hanigan sometimes backed his truck out without looking. She was a little dizzy by the front walk. The Hardwick house smelled faintly of tea, and there was a damp towel slung over the banister like a flag of truce. Ivy was at the kitchen table with a plate of cucumber slices and a smear of peanut butter in a bruised bowl. Her hair looked like she\u2019d tried to organize it with her hands and then given up halfway through.\n\n\u201cNell? Why are you making the face?\u201d Ivy asked, whipping around.\n\n\u201cNo face,\u201d Nell said. She leaned on the doorframe with both hands and tried to make her eyes normal. \u201cFine face. Usual face.\u201d\n\n\u201cNell. Is this about that professor who thought your last story was \u2018overwrought in an earnest way\u2019?\u201d Ivy had taken exactly one creative writing class at the community college years ago and decided that critiquing was an art form best practiced on an unwilling sibling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014this is not a story thing,\u201d Nell said. She grabbed the back of a chair. \u201cI got a call.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bad kind? The hospital?\u201d Ivy\u2019s laugh was immediate and then reeled back, a whoops. You say the hospital as if it lives in your pocket.\n\n\u201cThe good kind. From the Pie-Off. Someone dropped out. They want me in.\u201d She waited for the air to change, and it did. Ivy\u2019s eyes went wide. She brought both hands to her mouth and made the kind of sound that puppy videos on the internet are made for.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding. Are you kidding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you said yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to the finals.\u201d Ivy said the words slowly, tasting them like cake batter. \u201cOh\u2014this is the part where I should be a sensible older sister. Wait, I\u2019m younger. I keep forgetting. This is the part where I should say, \u2018Elle, be careful with your, you know, insides.\u2019 But I cannot be careful in this moment. I am reckless in this moment.\u201d She grabbed one of the cucumbers and tossed it into the air, trying to catch it in her mouth, and hit herself in the forehead instead. \u201cOw.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making me feel like I\u2019m fourteen,\u201d Nell said, but she couldn\u2019t wipe the grin off either. The kitchen seemed suddenly too small. She could see herself in the tiny square of the microwave door, flushed, hair snapping in unruly directions, eyes bright like polished coins.\n\nIvy looked at her with a light behind her eyes that made her look softer than usual. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Riverbend,\u201d she said. \u201cI want a lemonade in a cup so big I can\u2019t hold it. I want us to get sunburned and argue about which goats at the petting zoo are plotting to escape.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all plotting to escape,\u201d Nell said.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Ivy said with satisfaction. \u201cAlso, Ambrose will probably be there in his bright vest, counting heads like ducklings.\u201d She pronounced the name with such precise annoyance that Nell had to laugh.\n\n\u201cWho is Ambrose?\u201d Nell said.\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cI made him up just now. Sounds like a person who would own a clipboard and exactly seven pens.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s real,\u201d Nell said. \u201cAmbrose Weller. He called. He sounded like he was smiling with his whole face.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, Ambrose is now uncle Ambrose, patron saint of pies.\u201d Ivy drummed on the table. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Mom.\u201d\n\nNell made a face. \u201cMom would\u2014\u201d she started, but the word would was a cliff. Mom would what? She would either laugh or she would say, why are you filling your stomach with things that aren\u2019t good for you and are also not good for somebody\u2019s soul. She would say, I heard on the radio about people who overdo those competitions and then never feel right again. She would say, be careful, honey. That be careful would be full of all the other carefuls. Careful with the streets. Careful with men who want too much. Careful with your hope. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell her after,\u201d Nell decided.\n\nIvy nodded solemnly, then reached across and squeezed Nell\u2019s forearm with cold cucumber fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll make us a lunch for Saturday. We can park the car under the oak tree if we get there early. You can sit on the hood and feel important.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can already feel important standing in my kitchen,\u201d Nell said, and both of them laughed because the kitchen had a hexagon of sunlight on the floor and a plant in the window that was both alive and dead and nothing about it was important to anyone but them.\n\nBetween now and Saturday there were three days that stretched like taffy. That afternoon, Nell tried to run the loop again and gave up, spent from the morning in a way that had nothing to do with muscles. She went to Dovetail instead and stood by the counter, not quite ready to say it out loud to Vera. The clatter of the kitchen was pattering against her ears; someone dropped a spoon with a clang that made her jump. Vera had her sleeves rolled up and flour like snow under her fingernails.\n\n\u201cHardwick,\u201d Vera said without looking up. \u201cYou\u2019re square.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like a person who is thinking in corners,\u201d Vera said. She dusted her hands. \u201cSpit it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to Riverbend,\u201d Nell said. The words tasted like the first cold sip of a drink you make yourself wait for.\n\nVera looked up properly, and there it was\u2014joy like a coin flipped up in sunlight and caught. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Vera said again, but this one sounded like yes. \u201cDo you want to practice or do you want to sit and let your nerves chew on you like a dog on a slipper.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this a trick question?\u201d Nell said, but she had already slipped into the rhythm of the back-and-forth with Vera, the way the older woman would look thoughtfully at a pile of crust as if it were a problem in physics. Today there were peach pies cooling on the racks, the skins slipped off the fruit in long spirals that made the trash can look festive. Vera pointed at the bowl of whipped cream like a conductor with a tiny baton.\n\n\u201cNo cream,\u201d she said. \u201cFinals are no props. You can have water, a towel, and your ridiculous self-discipline.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not ridiculous,\u201d Nell said, and then, because she was being a person who needed to be teased, Vera smirked and said, \u201cIt is, but that\u2019s why we like you.\u201d\n\nVera had once been a dancer, and you can tell because she moves her hands like choreography and because the way she stands always looks like a beginning. When she showed Nell how to angle a plate so that what hits the nose is less shocking, it looked like a step in a routine. When she showed her how to breathe past a hiccup, it looked like symphony.\n\n\u201cDo you think\u2014\u201d Nell started, and stopped.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Vera said, eyes like nails.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke, right? I know it is a joke. The whole thing is a joke. I don\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d She could feel the skin between her eyebrows pinch. \u201cI mean, I want to treat it like a thing and not like\u2014whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a trick you learned at camp to make new friends,\u201d Vera said with a laugh that had mostly empathy in it and only a little sting. \u201cIt\u2019s both. It\u2019s a joke, and it\u2019s a serious one. You\u2019re allowed to care about silly things, Nell. It doesn\u2019t make you silly. It makes you alive.\u201d\n\nNell took that sentence into her mouth and turned it over with her tongue. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Vera said. \u201cThen eat your ridiculous fruit pies and go be a champion at something you can\u2019t put on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Are you going to tell your coach?\u201d\n\nNell looked at the floor. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod save me from righteous athletes,\u201d Vera muttered, but there was no judgment in it. She pushed a plate across to Nell. \u201cHalf pace,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t blow out your cheeks like a cartoon. You\u2019re not a bellows, you\u2019re an animal. Slow. Small. Use your nose.\u201d\n\nNell practiced until her cheeks were sticky and her throat was raw in the way you get from laughing too hard. She practiced until the air smelled more like sugar than she could bear. She went home and slept so hard that the shape of her mouth imprinted the pillowcase. In her dreams she was running through an orchard with pies hanging from the branches like ridiculous apples, and every time she touched one it turned into her coach\u2019s stopwatch and clicked at her, merciless and bright.\n\nThursday night, the contestants\u2019 call was a grid of faces on her cracked laptop, many of them people she had seen only from the side as they bent over plates in Brockton or Dorchester, a few of them newbies. There was a man with a baby on his lap and a woman in a hoodie that said Eat Pray Munch. Ivy watched from the couch, her knees tucked up under her, making faces whenever someone\u2019s audio cut out.\n\n\u201cMute yourselves if you\u2019re not talking,\u201d Ambrose said, looking exactly as Ivy had described him, which was alarming. He had a clipboard and seven pens visible behind his ear in a little crown, and his hair did a thing at the front like it had been styled by accident. \u201cWe have eight contestants. Rules are on page two of your packet. No outside condiments. Hands at sides until the horn. You may drink water. If you throw up\u2014it says in the rules \u2018regurgitate,\u2019 but I\u2019m not afraid of a word\u2014we disqualify. Ten-minute timer. Pies are standard nine-inchers; fillings are apple and blueberry alternated for fairness. Crust is traditional. No pre-slitting the top. And yes,\u201d he said, raising a finger toward a man in a baseball cap who had leaned toward the screen to ask a question, \u201cwe will have napkins. But don\u2019t count on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmbrose,\u201d someone said, \u201ccan we get a list of who\u2019s in.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Ambrose said, and read names like a tiny parade. Big Ray Lafferty, who worked, rumor had it, as a bouncer in Quincy and could lift a keg like it was a kitten. Tina Cole, who did yoga and had a grin that could disarm a whole jury. Julian Pike, who had the kind of narrow face that made him look as though he were perpetually smelling something too sweet. Two newcomers with regular names that Nell promptly forgot because her heart was beating too loud. And then, \u201cLast, we have a late addition, Nell Hardwick of Stoughton\u2014\u201d\n\nIvy squeaked. \u201cShhh,\u201d she said at her own noise, forgetting to be quiet about being quiet.\n\nAmbrose smiled into the camera like he\u2019d heard a secret. \u201cWelcome, Nell. We\u2019re glad to have you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d Nell said, because the square with her own face on it made her skin crawl, so she stopped looking at it and stared at Ambrose\u2019s thumbs instead. They were square thumbs. She wondered if he played an instrument.\n\nRay leaned into the camera, his face filling his square. \u201cHey, Hardwick,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard you\u2019re a runner.\u201d\n\nNell leaned too, in self-defense. Her laptop made a small humming sound like it was trying to be brave. \u201cI heard you\u2019re a bouncer,\u201d she said.\n\nRay chuckled. \u201cOnly on weekends. The rest of the time I teach fifth graders. I tell them not to eat too fast.\u201d He pointed at the camera. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. The first bite is always the worst.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Nell said. Tina gave her a little salute. Julian had arrived late and immediately left his video off, which made his square a gray silhouette like a person in a witness protection scheme. He didn\u2019t speak. A baby somewhere gurgled. Ambrose set his jaw and ran through logistics with the cheerful containment of someone used to herding cats. When the call ended, the apartment felt like a room that had just been evacuated.\n\n\u201cI like Ray,\u201d Ivy said.\n\n\u201cI do too,\u201d Nell said, and surprised herself by adding, unprompted, \u201cJulian is a weasel.\u201d\n\nIvy snorted. \u201cWeasel is a strong word. He\u2019s probably just shy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Nell said, remembering the way his name had dragged across the syllables as if it had burrs attached. \u201cI had a feeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always have feelings,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cThey\u2019re usually wrong. Except about street corners and custard.\u201d She slithered off the couch and onto the floor and did three sit-ups because she had suddenly remembered that her beloved jeans had betrayed her last week. \u201cSo, Saturday: we pack. We bring sunscreen. I make sandwiches.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing heavy,\u201d Nell said, and the words were already rote, and then she saw the face Ivy made\u2014lightly teasing but also drawn, slightly\u2014and said, \u201cNo, I mean\u2014make whatever you want. I\u2019ll eat a little. I just\u2014timing.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Ivy said, rolling her eyes dramatically so that she was not, in fact, looking at Nell at all. \u201cI\u2019m going to prepare an artisanal feast and you can nibble a grape and say, Sister, divine.\u201d\n\n\u201cDivine,\u201d Nell said, putting a hand to her forehead. \u201cSister, divine.\u201d\n\nThey planned, in the haphazard way of sisters who have made a habit out of making plans and then having life laugh at them. Ivy set out the cooler and then put it away because they didn\u2019t own enough ice packs. She made a list on the back of an envelope that already had the word dentist scribbled on it, with the dentist crossed out and replaced with mending and then both crossed out by a doodle of a bird. She was learning how to keep house while sharing a house with someone whose idea of keeping was to put her shoes back in the same place twice in a row. They argued about which blanket to bring and settled on the old plaid one with a hole that had eaten a darker hole out of the middle.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Nell said on Friday morning, when Ivy started to talk about batting practice at the fair. \u201cYou\u2019re getting ahead. You\u2019re trying to give me a future so I don\u2019t have to think about the present.\u201d\n\nIvy stared. \u201cYou are not allowed to say that like you\u2019ve just been to therapy and are teaching your poor sister a lesson.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not allowed,\u201d Nell echoed, and then kissed the top of Ivy\u2019s head with a flourish. \u201cMake me an egg,\u201d she said, and Ivy did, the way she favored it on low heat, the edges frilly and crisp.\n\nFriday afternoon they went to Bird Street Conservation to walk in the green hush, to burn off the nerves in silence. They crossed the little boardwalk that seemed to float over the pond and the insect buzz sounded like a machine turned low. Nell could feel the elastic pull of dread and delight in her stomach, the rope they tied around the post at a kid\u2019s party before the pi\u00f1ata hits. She squeezed Ivy\u2019s hand and then let it go, squeezed and let go, as if she were tempering chocolate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about what comes after,\u201d Ivy said to the trees. \u201cLike, pizza.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and food,\u201d Nell said.\n\n\u201cYou and food,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cYou used to be the kid who counted her corn kernels so she could make sure we both got the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were the kid who would eat mine if I didn\u2019t move fast enough,\u201d Nell said, and they smiled at the water without turning to look at each other. The sun went behind a cloud and came out again like a trick.\n\nPacking for Saturday, they found themselves moving in a clumsy dance around the small apartment. Nell put her lucky socks in the bag and took them out and put them back in. She had not had cause to call them lucky before; they had been simply socks she liked. Now they were artifacts. The bag grew heavier: towel, water bottle, spare tee, hair tie with the metal bit that always snagged a hair and made her swear. Ivy set her phone on the counter and then slid it into the bag and then took it out again because she had a superstition about keeping your phone in your bag\u2014that it made you forget it was there and then you sit on it and shatter your day.\n\nAt ten that night, Ivy pulled a jar of mayonnaise from the cabinet and set it on the counter with a clunk.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nell said without looking up from the packet, which she was reading for the seventeenth time. \u201cAbsolutely not. You know the rules. No condiments. Ambrose would materialize out of the sink and give you a lecture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to bring it,\u201d Ivy said, making an offended face at the jar. \u201cI was going to make potato salad. For me. Because I am a human being who enjoys her life even when her sister has decided to do battle with pastry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a human being who uses too much mayonnaise,\u201d Nell said.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing,\u201d Ivy said, and to demonstrate she unscrewed the lid, dipped a finger into the jar, and tasted it like frosting. She made a face that said, that was a mistake, and then laughed and tapped a dollop onto Nell\u2019s elbow.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Nell said. \u201cGrease me and see if I care.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will care,\u201d Ivy said, wiping it off and flicking the paper towel across the room into the trash can without looking. It landed on the rim and overbalanced the whole thing onto the kitchen floor, where it surrendered in slow motion. They stared at it for a beat, then burst out laughing so hard that the neighbor banged on their wall with a broom handle and someone shouted, \u201cGo to bed,\u201d and then, more quietly, \u201cGood luck tomorrow,\u201d and they pressed their faces into each other\u2019s shoulders to stifle the noise.\n\nSaturday came in quietly, with pale light flattening the edges of everything. Nell woke before the alarm because her muscles did, all of them, a chorus of small throats saying, now? She lay still with her hands on her stomach and breathed in a slow line. The parlor floorboards made the sound of a person remembering a joke in the next room. Ivy\u2019s door was half-open and the bed was a mess. Ivy slept like she was chasing something and she usually caught it.\n\nBreakfast was a banana not yet brown enough and toast the exact shade of gold that made Vera say, approvingly, you can\u2019t teach that. On the way out the door, Ivy swooped back for the blanket and knocked a glass off the coffee table with her hip; the glass was empty and still it made a sound like a catastrophe, but it did not break. They left the apartment in a skitter of apologies to objects and a flurry of pockets checked, thumbs tapping.\n\nThey drove with the windows cracked and the radio playing a song about summer that made Ivy roll her eyes so hard she got a headache. Riverbend Fairgrounds were exactly where the fairgrounds always are: at the edge of things, where the land flattens out as if resigned. The parking lot was a soft cloud of dust that puffed when you walked through it. The smell of fried dough could have been its own city. Children were already sticky, the kind of universal stick that no wipe can fix. A speaker nearby was playing someone\u2019s voice too fast: a man auctioning off jokes. Nell\u2019s stomach did not flip. Nell\u2019s stomach stood at attention and saluted.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find Ambrose,\u201d Ivy said, because she had developed affection for her invented uncle. \u201cHe will guide us. He will lay a hand on a hay bale and the hay bale will become a podium. He will lead us to the tent of triumph.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease keep your imagination inside your ribs,\u201d Nell said, but she was smiling, which made her words friendly and not cruel. She found the sign-in table easily. There was a banner overhead with a pie slice as a logo and the words Commonwealth Pie-Off written in a font that tried to look like someone had done it with a fountain pen. Ambrose was there, of course. He and his seven pens. One of them was already out of ink.\n\n\u201cNell!\u201d he said, the kind of greeting that places your name right in the middle of his day on purpose. He gave her a badge that said FINALIST in a font that did not try to look expensive. He handed a second badge to Ivy. VOLUNTEER, it said, and Ivy held it up to her chest like a corsage.\n\n\u201cOh wow,\u201d Ivy whispered, but into the day, not into any ear in particular. \u201cLook at the goats. They\u2019re already planning. Look at that one. His eyes\u2014criminal.\u201d\n\nNell tuned out the goats and the laughter caught in the tent behind them. She heard Ray\u2019s laugh and turned toward it like a plant leaning into sun. He was at the edge of the staging area, talking to a little boy about worms. \u201cDo they breathe?\u201d the boy was saying, and Ray was answering with more seriousness than most teachers give to the end of the year.\n\nTina waved. Julian drifted in, late as on the call, with a woman trailing him who had that pinched look of someone who never quite gets what she wants and has decided to tell everyone about it later. Julian saw Nell and didn\u2019t disguise the way his eyes moved from her shoes to her face like a scanner.\n\n\u201cHardwick,\u201d he said, blandly. \u201cHeard you came up from fourth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it works,\u201d Nell said. \u201cWhen someone drops, someone else picks up.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot lucky,\u201d he said, and there was something in the way he trimmed the word down, shaved it to its bone.\n\nNell made a quiet \u201chm\u201d noise at him because she is a person who will say more than she intends to if she replies. He smiled, quick and transient, like something you see in a car window and aren\u2019t sure you saw at all.\n\nAmbrose clapped his hands for attention. \u201cHalf hour. Warm-ups,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t like a team gather; it was more like herding ducks. Someone yelled something about corndogs. The air under the tent had warmed by ten degrees by the time they had all shuffled in to see their places. The tables were long and the pies under their domes looked innocent in a way that made Nell jealous of them. The crowd would be ready to watch their innocence be eaten.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll meet you back here,\u201d Ivy said brightly, tapping the cooler. \u201cI put your lunch in this like it\u2019s a prize. Eat a little. Something with salt, something with calm.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Nell said, but neither of them believed it. They believed more in signs. In the way the rope lay coiled by the tent post, in the number of blue balloons and the exact angle of the sun. They believed in each other. Ivy kissed Nell\u2019s cheek with a smack and then looked, briefly, serious.\n\n\u201cWhatever happens,\u201d she said softly, not quite a whisper because they did not whisper important things, \u201cwe\u2019ll get out of here and go sit on our blanket and make fun of tiny goats.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever happens,\u201d Nell said, and the words went into the skin between them and lodged there like pins that never pricked. She turned and walked toward the stage and felt the entire world tilt a fraction, not visible to anyone else but making her adjust her feet so she didn\u2019t stumble.\n\nBehind the tent, the contestant table was set with paper name cards that someone had doodled flowers on because someone had been bored. Nell\u2019s had a little runner drawn in the corner, which made her laugh. Beside it, a bottle of water sweated itself a ring. She moved in her small square, tested the table edge, shook out her arms lightly. Ray did a little dance. Tina closed her eyes and breathed. Julian was nowhere; then he was there, and then he was gone again, slippery, like his name.\n\nThe time compressed. Ambrose raised a hand. The crowd leaned. Somewhere, the goats made their planning noises. Nell looked once toward the open field where Ivy would lay a blanket in the sun, where a basket would sit full of sandwiches, where in an hour or two they would sit side by side and Nell would say, do you feel that, like a door opened and then closed, like something left and then something else came. She looked once, because you have to have somewhere to look when the noise starts. The volunteers moved like a school. Ray rolled his shoulders and grinned across the table at her and whispered, \u201cFirst bite,\u201d and she nodded and tucked her hair behind her ear like that was going to accomplish anything.\n\nThere are things you decide in the moment before. Who you are, for one. Or who you will be for ten minutes. Nell decided, again, that she would be funny later and serious now, or perhaps exactly the other way around. She rolled her wrists. She set her mouth. And then a woman with a hat shaped like a rooster signaled the opening gong by hitting a pan with a wooden spoon so hard that it went clang and the sound went up like birds, and everyone leaned forward, their faces a caricature of forwardness, and the first pie came toward her like a blessing and a dare.The first bite was always the worst because it was a betrayal. Your mouth thought it knew what was coming\u2014sweet and crust and the soft give of fruit\u2014and then there was the blunt reality of flour that hadn\u2019t known a breath of air since dawn and sugar that tried to stick to your tongue like a child who does not want to be put down. Nell let it happen. She let the shock take her, the way you let a wave slap you once so you know how hard to brace for the next. The crust top lifted under her teeth with a sound only she heard, a dry whisper. She cut a neat wedge with her mouth, two chews, a third because her mother\u2019s voice from some kitchen years ago insisted on a third, and then she took a slip of water and moved it down. Ray\u2019s \u201cFirst bite!\u201d came like a charm from somewhere to her left. The crowd made a sound like wind pushing through a field. A volunteer with a sash that said STATE PIE-SON laughed for no reason that had anything to do with her, which felt like blessing.\n\nShe found the rhythm like she always did, not in numbers but in landmarks that had nothing to do with the table in front of her. Corner seam, inhale, cut line, quick press of tongue, swallow. Crust edge, jaw soft not hard, breath out through nose because Vera had said, in a tone you only use with dogs and dancers, don\u2019t waste air. She anchored to the feeling of her feet inside her shoes, the way her sock bunched slightly under her right big toe because laundry had been lazy this week. The pie was apple, tart and smart, not a sloppy one. She loved Vera for a second, irrationally, and then remembered Vera had not made this and loved whoever did with equal irrationality.\n\nJulian\u2019s plate clashed with something metal and he swore, softly, a sibilant sound he tried to fold into the noise. He was fast, but fast in a way that prided itself on violence; he went at the top crust like it had insulted him. Tina flared her nostrils like a mare and settled into a steady tempo that would make any coach weep in gratitude. Ray made a face at a baby in the front row between bites, an exaggerated cross-eyed thing that the baby rewarded with a shriek of joy that could have counted as a weapon if anyone had been keeping a different kind of score. Ambrose moved along the back like a general who never learned to march; he was all bounce and wrists, tapping the stopwatch with his thumb as if reassurance could be transmitted through plastic. He had exactly seven pens in his pocket and one in his mouth, chewed as if it were licorice.\n\nThe second pie was blueberry and it made her feel like a person being forgiven. The juice glossed her teeth and followed the spoon of her tongue down into the place where things wait to become you. She adjusted. Smaller bites now, because the blue wanted to run, and if it ran onto her wrist she would have to ignore it and she did not trust herself to. She tasted summer and a small thread of salt that must have been someone\u2019s sweat because the tent was a ten degrees hotter than God intended, and she did not stop. She listened for Ivy without looking for Ivy, because seeing her would be both perfect and a wrecking ball. She caught only the outline of her laugh, thrown like a rope across the back of the tent. Somewhere a goat bleated like a door hinge with an opinion. The woman with the rooster hat banged the pan again for some other event and Ambrose waved at her with a look that said, politely, later.\n\nAt two minutes in, her body suggested\u2014kindly, but firmly\u2014that she was making a mistake. It wasn\u2019t a cramp. It wasn\u2019t even pain. It was a pressure that announced itself under her breastbone, a careful administrator knocking on the office door in the middle of class with a memo: The stomach is full enough. Please take corrective action. She negotiated. She was fluent in this language, the bargaining the body does when it thinks it is in charge. Okay, she said to herself, okay, but we\u2019ve trained, and also, be quiet. She shortened the chew to almost nothing, counted breaths instead of swallows, and let the water do some of the work that would have been forbidden in the pool but was acceptable here. Ray coughed and covered it with a smile, then gave the tiniest nod in Nell\u2019s direction like they were colleagues in a bad play who had decided to save each other.\n\nJulian edged his plate an inch closer to Nell\u2019s space as if the surface area of table pledged allegiance to him. She did not flinch; flinching would concede something. She made her world the diameter of the pie tin and the circle of her mouth. He made a sound\u2014not a gag, not anything that would catch a judge, just an aggressive throat clear\u2014that sent one person in the crowd into a reflexive chorus of \u201cYuck\u201d and another into laughter. Ambrose glanced that way without stopping his walk. He had a hummingbird\u2019s attention span and a hawk\u2019s eyes. Tina shifted her hips, found calm again, and murmured something that might have been prayer or cursing. Nell swallowed and gave her stomach a compliment for still working. She told it it was pretty, because sometimes the body is vain and will do what you need if you flatter it.\n\n\u201cFive,\u201d Ambrose called, and because he had not specified seconds or minutes, the word rushed over the tent like weather. A kid somewhere started to chant what he thought was helpful and what was not: \u201cEat! Eat! Eat!\u201d The cadence was wrong. Nell made her own, quiet and internal. Cut, curve, wet, nose. She felt a hiccup bloom in her diaphragm, treacherous and hiccups always felt like they had been mailed to her by enemies. She did the thing Vera had shown her, pressing the heels of her hands lightly against the bottom of her ribcage, exhaling into the space without giving away air she could not spare. It worked. She thought of the elm that dropped seed pods on her like a kindness because her brain needed a tree right now. The world shrank to a table and expanded to include the first mile marker on her favorite route, a bend where the asphalt had a scorch mark from some accident that had happened when she was a child and was never washed away. The memory was so crisp it made her teeth ache as if it had touched them.\n\nOn some level under the part of her that did this absurd thing with competence, she knew she was being watched. Not the friendly kind. There was a gaze like a cold hand at the back of her neck from somewhere beyond the first row of spectators, beyond the children with sticky hands and behind the tall man in the Bruins shirt holding two lemonades as if they were trophies. It wasn\u2019t Coach Marta; Coach Marta would have been scowling so hard the tent would have collapsed. It wasn\u2019t her mother. She wasn\u2019t sure who it was until she saw, in the glint of a spoon, the quick reflection of someone standing with arms crossed as if to hold in a thousand opinions. Vera. Of course she had come. Dovetail had set out a short rack of hand pies at the fair and sent Vera with a square tin to sell them as an experiment in advertising. A flour smudge on her throat made her look like she\u2019d been kissed by a ghost. Nell\u2019s throat tightened for a different reason and she had to school her face back into neutral because smiling would do nothing but trap sugar in the corners of her mouth and make her look pyrrhic.\n\nThe third pie was apple again and drier. The baker had been frugal, or had been spooked by the way fruit changes its mind when it meets heat. The crust was beautiful to look at and false on the tongue, like a dress you buy because of the hanger and then hate when you put it on. Nell adjusted. She took a sip of water every three bites whether her body asked or not, because compliance does not always make you a winner but it makes you finished. Julian lifted his plate to tilt the pie like a burger. It was a small cheat and not illegal and meant only that the syrup would go places syrup did not belong, but he liked the drama of it. A blueberry slid toward the table and he caught it with the back of his knuckles and flicked it into his mouth with a flourish so small most people would have missed it, but Nell saw because the unfair always glowed for her even when it was tiny and stupid. She felt the ghost of what anger would be later and let it ride by like a loud motorcycle on a road she no longer lived on.\n\nAmbrose\u2019s hand shot up at seven and then down again. He must have had some deal with the rooster-hat woman because she did not hit the pan, and Nell loved him for that with an intensity she would forget his name deserved after this. A bead of sweat found the ridge at her temple and paused there. She did not wipe it away. She would not do a single thing with the hand that did not serve this minute. Ivy made a sound, or maybe the sound was just what her brain supplied when it needed Ivy, and Nell took the smallest breath that had ever counted as a breath and kept going. When she had trained for the mile, Marta had said, there\u2019s a point where you leave the person who walked in and you wait. If you wait long enough the person who can do this shows up. She waited. She crossed the little invisible threshold and the stupid crown she wanted\u2014the one without jewels that would live in a cardboard box under a bed\u2014rose like a piece of toast in her head.\n\nThere was always a moment in any race where you felt an apology forming like weather. I am sorry, you thought at your knees, at your lungs, at the muscle inside your left thigh that never trusted you again after the injury in February. I am sorry for asking. She felt it now. She felt the apology and then the counterargument that she had learned to bring: You wanted this. You signed your own name. She chewed. She swallowed. She tried and failed not to think about what this would do to her night run tomorrow, whether she would feel like a bag of flour strapped to a bad idea. She imagined the goats escaping in a small, dignified parade, tiny horns like punctuation marks.\n\nAt nine, the tent sounded different. It was not quieter, but the noise had turned a corner into something that pulled at the edge of your clothing. The crowd wanted a finish the way a crowd always does: not because they wished you harm, but because they needed the relief of completion so they could get another lemonade. Ambrose\u2019s thumb hovered over the stopwatch button like a blessing and then retreated because he wasn\u2019t a god, even with his pens. Ray\u2019s grin had become something that looked almost like a grimace, and then he saw Nell see it and turned it into a grin again because he was that kind of person even when no fifth graders were present. Tina was steady as laundry. Julian had a halo of crumbs on his cheeks like a biblical painting done on a bad day. He was still fast. He was also sweating and his sweat smelled like cinnamon and nerves.\n\nThe hiccup tried her again at nine-forty. It grabbed her diaphragm with a little hook and said, cruelly casual, remember me. She pressed her tongue flat to the roof of her mouth and let her breath fall low. She thought of Ivy\u2019s forehead when she slept, the small crease that meant she was dreaming fast. She thought of Vera\u2019s nail beds dusted white. She thought of a bench on Central where the gum left by teenagers in winter had made a fossil. She did not hiccup. She swallowed the bite that had threatened to be a catastrophe and the swallow went down with the relief of a train that hits the track after skidding in snow.\n\n\u201cTime!\u201d Ambrose yelled, and the word came with a clatter of something Nell could not see. The horn misbehaved and made a sound like a goose dying, but he had the watch raised in his hand and that was the gospel. Plates went down in a dozen claps. Bodies lifted back like puppets whose strings had slackened. Nell put her hands on the edge of the table and pressed, not because she needed to but because she needed to feel a surface that was not expectant. Her mouth tasted like metal and fruit and the idea of being fourteen. The audience made the noise an audience makes when they have watched someone do something they did not want to do themselves, a combination of admiration and faint disgust and gratitude.\n\nAmbrose and the judges moved along the line, calling numbers that barely made sense until they started to make too much sense. Slices counted, fractions of slices eyed with a severity that would have embarrassed people in any other context. \u201cNine and two-thirds,\u201d someone said near Tina, awed. \u201cEight,\u201d someone said near the newcomer with a small tattoo of a spoon on her wrist. Ambrose reached Ray and Ray shrugged as if to say, whatever happens, I have worms and fifth graders and a life. \u201cTen,\u201d Ambrose said, pleased. He got to Julian and paused because something was off but not obvious and then leaned in close. Julian leaned back with the posture of a person who believes leaning can save him. \u201cNine and a half,\u201d Ambrose said eventually, and Julian smiled with half his mouth because that way it looked like he hadn\u2019t planned to smile at all.\n\nWhen they came to Nell, she had to look away from her own plate because she knew, roughly, what she had done, but knowing it in public would make it real in a way she wasn\u2019t ready for. \u201cNine,\u201d Ambrose said, and then, after a beat and a tilt of his head that suggested he could make a living measuring small things with his eyes, \u201cand a quarter.\u201d He smiled then, a full one, none of this half-mouth nonsense, and gave the edge of her plate the tiniest tap with his knuckle like a secret handshake. Nell laughed because the only other option was to sob, and she did not have time for that today. Ivy\u2019s cheer came like a thrown coat from the edge of the staging area, bright and out of step with whatever the rest of the crowd was doing. Tina reached over and squeezed Nell\u2019s forearm as if they were already on the same team. Ray banged his hand on the table once and winced because the table was not designed for such affection.\n\nThey gave Ray first, Tina third, and Nell second, which felt, in the body, like being told you got into the college you had convinced yourself you didn\u2019t want because you couldn\u2019t afford it. Her name sounded different through the microphone when Ambrose said it, and she had a split-second to imagine what would happen if she just lay down under the tablecloth and took a nap under there and came out next year. She stood instead. She stood and let someone hang a ribbon around her neck that would make sense to exactly thirty people in her life. She shook Ray\u2019s hand and he leaned in to say, \u201cYou scared me a little,\u201d as if that were the highest compliment he could think to pay. She shook Tina\u2019s and Tina said, with her soft deadpan, \u201cYou made apple look kind,\u201d which meant actually nothing and meant everything, and they both knew it.\n\nJulian clapped at the requisite volume and not a decibel more, his palms slapping his rings. His runner\u2019s build made his clapping look sarcastic. The woman who had come with him, the one with the pinched mouth, looked Nell up and down like a person buying meat not convinced of its freshness. There was a half-second where Nell thought she saw, on the edge of Julian\u2019s lips, the brief quiver that meant something wanted out. Ambrose saw it too, and his gaze sharpened. The quiver went away. Sometime between the first place ribbon and the third, Julian disappeared, leaving behind a napkin on which someone had written a phone number that had been crossed out and replaced with a different one. Ambrose picked up the napkin as if it might explode, folded it neatly into a square, and slid it into his pocket with the pens.\n\nAfter the little photos and the larger photos and the joke someone made about pie face that made four people groan and one person laugh only because they wanted to be part of something, Nell found herself off the stage with the ribbon burning a gentle mark into the skin above her collarbone. Ivy nearly knocked her over, as if she had decided that tackle hugs were a language the world needed. The ribbon cut her chin in the press of it and they stepped back and laughed at their own clumsiness, both of them sweaty and bright-eyed like thieves who had gotten away with the hat and the money and the chandelier.\n\n\u201cYou were so disgusting,\u201d Ivy said with love.\n\n\u201cYou were so loud,\u201d Nell said with equal love.\n\n\u201cI held water like I was a queen,\u201d Ivy said, brandishing the empty bottle like a scepter. \u201cAlso, I learned how to say regurgitate in two languages.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you did,\u201d Nell said. The goats bleated in a chord that sounded like the end of something. Vera slid in from the right with the same stealth she must have used to slip into auditions once upon a time. She smelled faintly of vanilla and the cleaner they used at Dovetail that smelled like lemons only if you had never met one. She looked at Nell with her head tipped, like a person admiring a painting she had had no hand in but had approved on principle.\n\n\u201cYou were pretty,\u201d Vera said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean literally, though that too. I mean\u2014you did a pretty thing. That\u2019s the whole point. Congratulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Nell said, and because she wanted Vera to know what she had thought at the table, she said, \u201cThank you for making me ridiculous,\u201d and Vera smiled with embarrassment because compliments make her itchy.\n\nAmbrose hovered until hovering became awkward and then made it charming by announcing it. \u201cI am hovering,\u201d he said. \u201cI am trying to congratulate you without making it about my clipboard, which frankly does deserve some attention. You did well, Ms. Hardwick.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Nell said, again, because the word had not become insincere yet and she didn\u2019t think it would if she said it in the right tone. \u201cAnd the pens look nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d he said, deadpan, tapping the pocket. \u201cSomeone who notices. There\u2019s a supper after. It\u2019s ham and three salads no one eats. You are free to avoid it. But\u2014I wanted to say\u2014there\u2019s a showcase in August. It\u2019s smaller, more\u2026televised, which is a word I am uneasy using as if my life includes television. They ask a few finalists from around the region. It pays, which I am legally allowed to tell you, and there is less dust, which I am spiritually allowed to promise. If you\u2019re interested, I\u2019ll send your name and you can pretend you tripped and fell into it.\u201d\n\nNell felt the scalp-prickle of opportunity the way some people feel weather change in their knees. It was not what she had expected anyone to say to her today. She had thought maybe somebody would say, how do you breathe, and she would say, through my nose, like a goddamn secret, and then they would go home. She looked at Ivy, whose eyebrows had shot up as if Ambrose had just proposed to both of them. She looked at Vera, who made a face that in her subtle vocabulary meant, careful, not no, not yes, but careful, which was the same word they prayed now. She looked down at the ribbon and thought of Coach Marta\u2019s stopwatch and the way a beep can slice a day into before and after.\n\n\u201cSend it,\u201d she said, because even if this wasn\u2019t a life it was a thing that felt like one, and she wanted to see who she was when she stepped toward it. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014think. A lot. Too much. But send it.\u201d\n\nAmbrose nodded with relief out of proportion to the size of the ask. \u201cI will feel professional for at least nine minutes today because of this,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you.\u201d He shook her hand like she was a baker who had provided the right change without looking. \u201cAnd enjoy your goats.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Ivy said solemnly on their behalf.\n\nThey found the blanket under the oak tree because Ivy had the homing mechanism of a person who hoards comfort. The shade was a relief that made Nell\u2019s skin feel like a thing you could take off. Ivy set down the basket with theatrical pride and revealed her treasures: two sandwiches, one with cucumber and chive spread that made Vera\u2019s approval voice in Nell\u2019s head say okay, and one with roast chicken and too much mayonnaise because Ivy would never be deterred by an admonition. There were cherries with stems that curled like cursive, and a bag of salt-and-vinegar chips that had exploded on the drive into a puff of crumbs that had nevertheless kept their menace. There was lemonade in a mason jar because Ivy liked the way the glass made the sun look expensive. They ate slow, which was the only speed anyone wanted now.\n\n\u201cYour mouth is blue,\u201d Ivy said, satisfied.\n\n\u201cYou have a ribbon hickey,\u201d Nell said, pointing at her own clavicle to show the stain in return.\n\nThey lay back and watched the sky through the leaves. The fair moved around them like a friendly animal. A girl with her face painted like a tiger ran past, roaring in a way that would have been more convincing if she hadn\u2019t been clutching a candy apple like a teddy bear. A man tried to sell them kettle corn by offering them a free handful and they declined out of a decency that felt saintly. Ray wandered over with his fifth graders in tow\u2014apparently three of them had found him here, which seemed to be a thing that happened when you were that kind of man\u2014and waved without approaching because the oak tree shade looked sacred. Tina ran by without stopping, her hoodie tied around her waist, whooping at a toddler she clearly did not know and making the toddler whoop back, because some people conduct a band wherever they go and do not know they are doing it.\n\nVera sat on the corner of the blanket only after asking the blanket permission with her eyes. She handed Nell a napkin with a corner folded not quite perfectly. \u201cI am going to say something that will irritate you,\u201d she announced, which was the only way to say a thing like that without losing a friend. \u201cCall your coach. If she sees this on the internet before she hears it from you, she will turn into a saint of disapproval and haunt you until the next century. Better to choose your haunting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Nell said, because you can be brave with a lemonade in one hand and somebody\u2019s thumb on your ankle in a way that says I am here, which was what Ivy\u2019s thumb was doing. She rolled onto her side and fished her phone out of the bag. It was a rectangle of dread. She put it on her chest like a heavy book and stared at the oak canopy while she gathered the courage to pick it up.\n\nAs if the phone could smell it, it buzzed in that exact gut-dropping way a split-second before her thumb touched the screen. Her chest went tight and her mouth dried, which was absurd given the gallons she had just poured into it. The name on the screen was not Marta, which would have been a relief and would not have been a relief. It was her mother. If you could have photographed the moment her face recognized the letters, it would have won some competition for honesty. Ivy saw and made a sound like, oh. Vera pretended not to see so hard that it counted as kindness.\n\nShe answered. \u201cHi,\u201d she said, and every person she had ever been was in the one syllable.\n\n\u201cHi, honey,\u201d her mother said, and her voice was exactly as tired as it had been since the day Dad left and did not return even for his favorite cufflinks. There was an edge there that might have been the car, might have been a hallway, might have been a thought she hadn\u2019t told anyone yet. \u201cSomeone sent me a video. Mrs. Dalrymple, of course. Oh, Nell.\u201d She was the only person who could make the word oh sound like a laugh and a sigh and a weather report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014not what it looks like,\u201d Nell said, and then laughed at herself because it was exactly what it looked like. \u201cIt\u2019s a little what it looks like. It\u2019s the finals, Mom. I got second.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond,\u201d her mother said, as if the word had been carved out of a harder word. \u201cWell. Are you all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Nell said. Ivy was making faces at her, supportive faces, faces that said you are okay into the air so it would carry. \u201cIt was\u2014fun. And awful. Like cross-country but in your mouth. I didn\u2019t tell you because I\u2014\u201d She looked at Vera, whose mouth was a firm line in the shape of encouragement. She looked at Ivy, who mimed the act of zipping her lips and then unzipping them, which was unhelpful and perfect. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the be careful to make me feel like I was doing a wrong thing. I wanted it to feel like\u2014I was choosing it.\u201d\n\nOn the other end there was that small sound her mother made when she adjusted her glasses and tried to find language that didn\u2019t live in the first drawer. \u201cYou two girls,\u201d she said, and the girls had never left her mouth even when death and debt had tried to take everything else. \u201cDo you remember that you used to do that thing where you\u2019d race spoons? In the sink? And I\u2019d come in and you\u2019d be cheering for a spoon like it was going to go to college.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe still do that,\u201d Ivy said loudly, leaning toward the phone like it would drink her. \u201cThe spoons got scholarships.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hush,\u201d Mom said, but there was a smile in it. \u201cNell, be careful with your\u2014you know. Your breath. I don\u2019t know. Be careful with the part of you that always thinks one win is an answer. You get to do silly things if you want. You also get to protect your\u2014your knees, and your\u2014oh, I sound like an old woman with a bag of weather. I am proud of you in a way that includes worry. That\u2019s the only way I know how to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Nell said. The oak leaves made a sound like a skirt on a church floor. Somewhere a chicken complained. \u201cI\u2019ll come by after. You can tell me what you would do if you got second in a pie-eating contest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would frame the ribbon and then never talk about it again,\u201d her mother said instantly, which made all three of them laugh. \u201cOkay. I love you. I\u2019ll heat stew. It can be lunch or dinner or both.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d Nell said. When she hung up, she pressed the phone to her sternum the way you might press a photograph there and she allowed herself exactly twenty seconds of lying still and doing nothing and feeling like she had tugged a thread that led somewhere she couldn\u2019t see.\n\nThey were on their second round of cherries when he appeared. Julian, without his shadow woman, without his napkin of numbers, knocked the bottom of his foot against the edge of the oak\u2019s root as if it had offended him and then stood there with his hands in his pockets, looking at them without asking to be looked at. He had his sunglasses on the crown of his head where they could keep no one from being seen. He had the smile of someone who had crafted a sentence in his car and now wanted to let it out.\n\n\u201cThat was lucky,\u201d he said, and he might have meant it conversationally but the way his mouth turned the k made it a knife.\n\nNell sat up. She had the desire to say something mean, which she rarely indulged because it never felt as good as it promised. Ivy widened her eyes and then narrowed them in the universal sister semaphore for do not, or perhaps do, depending. Vera did not move at all, which was a move.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always luck,\u201d Nell said, because this was true and not true and the truth inside it made it honest enough to count. \u201cWe all show up with the same mouth. The rest is weather.\u201d\n\nJulian\u2019s smile twitched. The skin around his eyes tightened the way someone\u2019s does when they have learned not to show disappointment for an audience and then forget there are people who know where to look. He glanced at Vera as if she might be a judge even now, then back at Nell. \u201cThere\u2019s a televised thing,\u201d he said, as if he were dispensing a secret for a price. \u201cYou should say no.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of advice for someone I just met,\u201d Nell said. \u201cDo you say yes or no to things? Are you the kind of person who says yes to everything and then calls them accidents, or the kind who says no and then lives angry.\u201d\n\nHe stared for a second because he had expected her to be soft. Then he shrugged, which was not a shrug, and turned. \u201cSee you around,\u201d he said, which had in it the threat and the promise of every small town\u2019s limited options. He walked away with his shoulders set, and whatever he would say about her later had already written itself on his face.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely a weasel,\u201d Ivy whispered, the moment he was out of earshot.\n\n\u201cWeasels are useful,\u201d Vera said, out of her past life as a person who knew the names of animals in books. \u201cThey keep down certain other populations. We are grateful for them even when they get into the kitchen.\u201d\n\nNell laughed and lay back down and thought about August. The sky above the oak was the kind of blue you could fall into and not be returned. The ribbon on her chest itched and she let it. She closed her eyes and saw the pies rolling toward her like little planets. She closed them again and saw a stopwatch turn into something else entirely, a coin maybe, or a bell. She closed them once more and saw herself running where the sidewalks were cracked, counting her weird litany: mailbox, stop sign, elm, bench, memorial, pothole, pie. She had a new word for the list now, which felt like the feeling you get when a friend teaches you the name of a flower you\u2019ve been seeing your whole life. She tasted sugar again and winced and smiled around the wince.\n\nThey stayed until the shadows lengthened and the children\u2019s tears began because staying past nap time makes all love tragic. They packed the blanket with the uncoordinated grace of two people deciding not to talk about what they were thinking because saying it would make it too true. They walked back across the dust and the goats judged them with their cold, rectangular eyes, which made Ivy cackle. Ray called, \u201cSee you at some ridiculous afternoon,\u201d and they waved, flapping their fingers in a manner that said yes to an invitation neither of them had yet received. Ambrose tilted his clipboard in farewell like an old-fashioned man tipping a hat. Vera squeezed Nell\u2019s shoulder with the part of her hand that is soft and said nothing, which was the only blessing Nell could have stood in that moment.\n\nIn the car, the seatbelts made their small mechanical coughs. The radio tried on another summer song and Ivy ordered it to behave and it did not. The ribbon lay in Nell\u2019s lap, a strip of fabric with a cheap pin and a history that felt heavy for its cost. Ivy drove with one hand and ate a chip with the other, a skill that would one day earn her a ticket and a lecture, but not today. The road out of Riverbend had a dip that made your stomach rise in a way that was fun if you were steady and catastrophic if you were on the edge of anything. They hit it and laughed because their bodies did not disagree. The day unspooled toward evening like a spool that did not know its thread was about to tangle, and Nell rested her head on the window and let the cool of it press a mark into her temple that would be shaped like a circle for an hour and like memory for longer.Chapter Five\n\nBy the time they reached their mother\u2019s street, the sun was melting low behind the roofs like a coin going soft. The Hardwick house, with its reluctant porch and the lilac that had taken over the second step as if it had bought the deed, looked like it always did: a little too proud for its bones and therefore familiar. Ivy parallel parked with the cinematic flourish of someone who believes every three-point turn is a scene, and they sat in the cooled-down car for a second because honor demanded they prolong the savoring. The stew smell met them halfway down the walk, heavy and forgiving. Someone on the block was playing the kind of music that lives in speakers like it was born there, and a dog across the street threw its opinion at a squirrel and missed, again, which was the dog\u2019s whole story.\n\nMom had set the good bowls out as if a ribbon demanded crockery. She stood with her hand on the back of a chair and looked them over as if she were accepting delivery of a painting. The ribbon lay on the table, flat and defenseless. She looked at it and then at Nell\u2019s face and then at the ribbon again, a path worn already.\n\n\u201cYou look outraged,\u201d Ivy said, kissing air on either side of her mother\u2019s cheek because actual kisses sometimes made both of them shy.\n\n\u201cI am arranging my feelings,\u201d their mother said. She took off her glasses and cleaned them on the corner of her cardigan in a motion that had comforted babies. \u201cThe arrangement will include pride. And soup. Sit.\u201d\n\nThey sat. The stew was beef that had been cow twice and then generosity, with potatoes that had surrendered and carrots that had refused, and it tasted like the kind of decision you make when you\u2019re not sure what the week will bring. Mom watched them eat but not too closely, a trick she had learned when they were small and had decided to insist on autonomy before they could spell it. She had lit a candle for no reason but smell, which was her new way of praying. The ribbon lay between the salt and the little dish of shredded cheese, a piece of plastic with weight attached by the three of them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be the mother of a person who eats pies as a sport,\u201d Mom said after the first few bites, which were always the most honest. \u201cI thought I had finished with\u2026adjusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like you\u2019re eighty,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cYou made a new email address last year and everything. You are modern. You are being modern about stew.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am being modern about stew,\u201d Mom said, which made her laugh at herself and then pretend to be irritated that her children had made her laugh. She turned to Nell. \u201cAre you going to keep doing it?\u201d\n\nNell put her spoon down and looked at the window because the window was not judging her; the window had seen them all cry and liked them anyway. The candle made the kitchen smell like two things at once and the confusion was bizarrely calming. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. It came out in the voice she used for presents she didn\u2019t understand yet. \u201cAmbrose said there\u2019s a showcase in August. Televised. I don\u2019t know what that means. If it\u2019s\u2026you know. Real.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be real because you will be in it,\u201d Mom said, and then made a face at her own earnestness because she had been friends with her own suspicion for decades. \u201cYou will tell your coach.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell my coach,\u201d Nell said, and the words sat in the room like a guest they would all accommodate. She pictured Marta\u2019s jaw and the way it settled when she had decided a person needed to be told something that might break them a little. She pictured the stopwatch face, impersonal and bright. She pictured a version of herself being reasonable and another version suing for joy. She picked up her spoon and let the stew\u2019s salt tell her all the unromantic truths that also count.\n\nThey ate like people who had already done a thing and would do other things later. After, Ivy and Mom washed up in the clack-and-glow of their familiar choreography, and Nell wandered to the refrigerator to stare at magnets as if they could answer. There was a calendar with dates circled that had acquired new meanings since Dad left, a list of library hours that were never useful when you needed them, a photo of Nell at eight holding a frog with both hands and making a face that looked like both of her parents at once. Her phone lay face down on the table, heavy with intent. She flipped it and there it was: Ambrose\u2019s email, subject line wearing its hat too formally. Also a message thread from the team, a flood of faces and names and the code language you only learn when you have run up a hill next to someone during a rainstorm and said three sentences you will never admit you said.\n\nJess had sent the video, of course. Jess, who ran the group text like she had been born in a phone. There were hearts and flaming emojis and a skull, because someone thought they were funny. Someone had written, you are going to puke in Providence and it is going to be art. Coach Marta had not weighed in. The absence was an outline of her shape. Nell felt the prickling relief of not being ambushed by Marta in front of everyone, and also the dread of knowing that ambush had just been rescheduled for a more private room.\n\nShe took her phone into her mother\u2019s back hall, into the narrow space where winter coats went to be forgotten and where once, in a tantrum she didn\u2019t remember except in the bones, she had kicked a scuff into the baseboard and then cried at the mark. She pressed call and listened to the ringing like a metronome that tried to keep her honest.\n\nMarta answered on the third ring with her signature greeting, which was to somehow make your name into an assessment. \u201cNell.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoach,\u201d Nell said, and every tendon in her body arranged itself in allegiance. \u201cI wanted to, um\u2014say it before you saw it. Someone probably sent it already. I went to Riverbend. For the\u2014Pie-Off finals. I got second.\u201d\n\nThere was a silence that did not pretend it was thinking. When Marta spoke, her voice was so even it felt like the flat part of a road after a bad hill. \u201cI saw. Congratulations.\u201d\n\nThe word did not splinter, but it had a hinge in it, and on the other side there was a weight. Nell found the door frame with her knuckles because she needed wood. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, like a person insisting their nouns do the job they were hired to do.\n\n\u201cWhat is it for you,\u201d Marta said, not in the way of a person asking about prize money, which would never interest her, but in the way of a person testing the quality of a string. \u201cIs it fun. Is it\u2014compulsion. Is it a way to take your competence for a walk because you are otherwise caged.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d Nell said, and stopped because she wanted to answer well and also because the truth wouldn\u2019t wait for her to syllable it into elegance. \u201cIt was supposed to be a joke. It\u2019s not a joke, exactly. It\u2019s not a plan either. It feels like a room I didn\u2019t know was in my house and now I keep opening the door just to see how the light is.\u201d\n\nMarta laughed, truly, and the sound rearranged the hall for a second. \u201cYou think in houses. That makes sense. I don\u2019t despise you for trying a new door. Here is the issue, and you already know the nouns. Training. Recovery. Gastrointestinal whatever. Also the narrative in your head. If you start needing the adrenaline of a crowd for silly things, you might need it for the serious ones later and it will not be there and you will feel betrayed by your own chemistry. We are a month from Providence. I have watched you turn one promise into a performance for years. You are allowed to do stupid things as long as you are as advanced at being careful as you are at being stubborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do both,\u201d Nell said, probably too fast, because her mouth had learned to get her ahead of her thoughts when the gun went.\n\n\u201cYou can,\u201d Marta said, but there was a question cracked into the center of it like an egg. \u201cHere are the terms, since terms help some people feel safe. No more competitions until Providence. If you want to go on this television in August, you and I will sit down with Vera and a nutritionist I trust and you will allow me to be boring in your vicinity while I plan the stupid alongside the serious so they do not murder each other. If in the next four weeks I catch you training your swallow instead of your stride, I will bench you with the kind of sorrow you cannot talk your way out of. Do you understand me.\u201d\n\nNell leaned her head against the coat with the broken zipper, which smelled like winter and the time Dad wore it to sleep on the couch because he had decided to be noble about something he had not warned anyone about. \u201cI do,\u201d she said. She meant it. She also reserved, in some quiet corner of herself, the right to feel put upon, which was silly and understandable. \u201cThank you for not calling me an idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have not earned idiot,\u201d Marta said. \u201cAlso, I am old enough and have been cruel enough to know when to keep my mouth closed. I will text you a plan for tomorrow. Do not worry about me watching the video again. I know what your face looks like when you pretend to be having fun for other people. You were having fun. That scares me less and more at the same time.\u201d There was a tiny sound like a fingertip against glass. \u201cEat something with salt and something green. Tell your sister to sleep before midnight for once. And, Nell\u2014stop counting mailboxes while you talk to me. Be where you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am in the hall,\u201d Nell said, because she had the impulse to be charming and corrected it into honest. \u201cI am a little stupid in the hall.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Marta said, and hung up in the graceful way she had of ending conversations precisely when they had said what they needed to. Nell stood with the dial tone trying to pretend it was important and then slid the phone into her back pocket and breathed like a person who had been given terms instead of doom.\n\nAmbrose\u2019s email bled cheer onto her retinas when she opened it. The showcase had a name that sounded like a cereal, and it would be held in a converted brewery that had been converted into a \u201ccreative space\u201d and then converted into an excuse for a thousand cameras to stare at food. There was pay. There was rehearsal that was absolutely not rehearsal. There were rules that were a paragraph longer than the State\u2019s and wore their logic like perfume. Ambrose had written her a note at the end, a little italicized aside that said, Think of it like a dance. Only with a worse playlist. I\u2019ve copied Vera because I am talented at pretending to be formal. He had included a photo of a goat with the subject line: surveillance, which made her laugh in a sudden loud bark that brought Ivy into the hall with her eyebrows up near her hairline.\n\n\u201cGoats?\u201d Ivy said, peering at the screen upside down and making that face she made when confronting a word problem on no sleep. \u201cWhy is Ambrose sending you goats. Does your uncle by invention think he is courting you with livestock.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Nell said, but she felt the warm spill of joy at being silly allowed to approach her again. She handed the phone to Ivy, who swiped with the authority of someone who swiped for two and then handed it to Mom. Mom blinked at the goat and then at the dollar amount because math lived behind her eyes these days. She made the small humming noise that meant her brain had put us and light bill in the same sentence and was testing the verb.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to become a novelty,\u201d Mom said, carefully, because novelty had been the death of several girls they had known in different neighborhoods. \u201cBut novelty can be rent. You will bring Vera. She is stern in the ways I am tired of being stern.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will bring Vera,\u201d Nell said, and felt the plan slot into the world like something you'd noticed only because it had been missing. The candle guttered and caught itself without help and they all pretended they had not thought about it.\n\nThat night, when they left, the air had gone silk and moths bounced off the porch light as if that were a life goal. Ivy carried the ribbon pinned to the back of her shirt, a joke that made her walk straighter. On the ride home, they let the radio do what it wanted because no one had the energy to wrangle it. They stopped at a red light that had a patience about it, the kind that considers its own contribution to the world. A Jeep rolled up next to them with the windows down and the laugh that fell out of it belonged to a girl from the team. Nora leaned across her passenger and shouted, \u201cPie assassin!\u201d and then laughed at her own cleverness because she always did. Nell flinched and then smiled because both were true. Ivy leaned her elbow out the driver\u2019s window and shouted, \u201cRespect pastry!\u201d which landed with the Jeep as if it had been arranged.\n\nSleep came in the complicated way it always had for Nell: in feints and returns. She slept, then woke, then slept, then had a conversation with a dream about whether the word regurgitate had ever been used in a love poem. When she woke for real, the ribbon had swung itself onto the lamp and looked like an object in a different house. Her muscles felt like they had been charted. She wrote down the plan Marta texted: an easy four, strides on grass, drills that made her feel like a kid again because they were genderless and true. She made coffee and found perpetually the way you find a familiar knob in a dark room.\n\nDovetail was quieter than it had any right to be on a Sunday morning. Vera had put out the chairs in pairs like people, which veered into sentimental if you knew her well. The case gleamed with scones and intention. A health inspector form was tacked to the cork board with a pushpin that wobbled, and there were two supplies boxes open on the floor with their tongues hanging out. Vera looked up from a ledger in which she had been gently arguing with numbers and smiled with only one side of her mouth, a trick that made her look both kind and conspiratorial.\n\n\u201cYou lived,\u201d she said, setting her pen down and crossing her arm bones over her apron as if she could hold her center in place by doing it. \u201cYour mother called me. I have been commended for corrupting a child properly. I will frame it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe likes you,\u201d Nell said, and then added, because she wanted to be honest in this building if nowhere else, \u201cShe\u2019s afraid of you in the right way.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Vera said. \u201cI am an excellent average jerk to people who think they can cheat the end of a recipe. Do you want a biscuit or do you want to confess your sins first.\u201d\n\n\u201cConfess,\u201d Nell said, and told her about Marta in the hall and the terms and the August thing and Ambrose\u2019s underwear drawer of pens. Vera listened like she was paying for listening by the minute, patient and not indulgent, which was how she had learned to be with herself after the dance company had decided it wanted younger pain. When Nell finished, Vera exhaled through her nose in a sound that could have been a prayer in a different religion.\n\n\u201cI can handle your coach,\u201d she said, with the calm of a person who had dealt with professors, choreographers, and the state of Massachusetts. \u201cI will let her plan boredom. You will not think about August until after Providence unless you are bored, which you so rarely are I cannot imagine it. You will find out, while I watch, whether doing something absurd once has bought you joy, or a habit, or both. If Julian shows up here, I will feed him a biscuit and then throw him out with the authority of the Commonwealth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he will show up,\u201d Nell said, because she had been circling that question in her head like a dog doing an old dance on a bed.\n\n\u201cHe is the kind of person who tries doors in other people\u2019s houses,\u201d Vera said, and this was not unkind so much as accurate. \u201cBut he might wait until it matters less to you. Weasels do that. Don\u2019t let your imagination give him more furniture than he brings.\u201d\n\nThey worked then, the satisfying work of wiping and rearranging and deciding what makes a room feel like a room you want to stay in. Ivy came in midmorning with a bag from the hardware store that looked like it contained either nails or candy, because those were her categories. She had gotten them a new push broom because the old one had been tilting like an argument. She set it in the corner like it had taken vows with the mop. She told them about a dream in which Ambrose was married to a goat and Vera smacked her with a dish towel until she remembered she had never been in a church in which vows were made to goats.\n\nThe town did its Sunday thing where it behaves like a bigger place for an hour and then remembers itself again. Mrs. Dalrymple came by and pretended she had not sent any videos to anyone, which was the extent of her guilt. Two of Nell\u2019s teammates came in and gave her a look that said sometimes we think you are collateral, but today we remember you are a person, and they bought croissants like rituals. Someone left a book on the corner table and then came back an hour later to reclaim it with relief that was so naked it made them all look away. The world refused to pick a mood, which was a relief.\n\nAmbrose came by just to be competent at standing. He had one pen in his ear and the others mercifully at home, and he leaned on the case as if it was a question he had put to sleep. \u201cCommittee meeting,\u201d he said, hitching a thumb toward the street in the direction of the community center and the horrible coffee that lived there. \u201cThere was concern about a comment on the video from someone who may or may not be Julian\u2019s cousin. Please remind me to build my own social platform where no one can say anything stupid unless they are in this room and have to do dishes after.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did the cousin say,\u201d Nell asked, because her curiosity was an animal she could not housebreak.\n\n\u201cThat you had an advantage because you are \u2018small and deceptive,\u2019 which is such a pile of adjectives I had to print it out and put it on my fridge,\u201d Ambrose said. \u201cAlso, that the pies favored your \u2018mouth shape,\u2019 which suggests the world has turned a corner I do not wish to peer around. We have decided to issue a statement that says pies favor no one and we love everyone unless they are on fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good at your job,\u201d Vera said, pouring him coffee that could wake a dead idea, and he took the compliment with a wince. It made something warm with a shadow move in Nell, the way seeing competence in a person always did, as if she were being issued a small piece of permission to continue.\n\nAt noon Marta appeared, hair still wet at the ends like she had punished herself with a cold shower, carrying a bag with the way a soldier carries anything that might explode. She set it on a chair and then stood behind it like a person looking over a small balcony. Vera\u2019s mouth tightened the way people\u2019s mouths do when they have complicated respect to deliver. They shook hands and the handshake had the feel of a meeting between two sovereign nations who had decided to share a river.\n\n\u201cI am here to propose peace,\u201d Marta said, without preamble. \u201cIt will involve broccoli. I apologize.\u201d\n\n\u201cApologies accepted and refused,\u201d Vera said. \u201cI will make you like my broccoli and you will resent me for it and we will both do our jobs.\u201d She gestured to a small table where the light was good but not cruel. \u201cSit.\u201d\n\nThey sat. They opened the bag and there were greens and a notebook and a printout with underlines. Ivy attempted to hover and Vera installed her at a different table with a scone and an instruction to count the number of people who came in wearing hats, which Ivy took with the seriousness of a person setting out to reckon with a census. Nell perched with her hands folded because that posture made her feel like her best version of a student. Marta and Vera discussed fuel the way some people discuss truce lines: what goes in, when, in what company, and how to tell the truth about it when your body wants to lie. They made lists with arrows and crossed-out jokes and a column that said emergencies. Nell watched them and felt the gratitude that rises only when two people care in different ways about the same ridiculous thing and agree to be kind anyway.\n\n\u201cHere is the main thing,\u201d Marta said, tapping the page until the paper thought it was being spoken to. \u201cNo heroics in the dark. If you feel your body starting to bargain with you at night, you text me, and you text me the words \u2018I am bargaining,\u2019 and I will tell you a boring story about my aunt\u2019s garden until you fall asleep. No extra miles on mornings after you have done stupid or even after you have only thought about doing stupid. No fasting. No dessert before practice like you are a saint. No sainting.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sainting,\u201d Nell said, and felt something unclench in the middle of her. \u201cI like dessert before practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you do,\u201d Marta said. \u201cThat is why I said it out loud. You will find other rebellions.\u201d\n\nThey signed the plan like it was a pact with a small dog. Vera made a broccoli salad in the back with the kind of skill that made people propose and plated it with a flourish that would have gotten her thrown out of several kitchens. Marta ate it with a face that was both skeptical and resigned, which was as close to praise as some people get. The light in Dovetail slid along the floor and made the chair legs look as if they were practicing for a show.\n\nIn the afternoon, while the coffee went slack and the scone tray looked picked-over and therefore attractive, Nell went for her easy four. She cut the loop small because her negotiation muscles were tired and she did not trust herself near the long route where the elm made her think about history more than was good for a person who needs to be present. The sidewalks still did their tricks and she still knew every root. She ran past the war memorial and past the stoop where the old men took turns saying yes and no like a seam and past the house with the broken wind chime that sounded like a lazy spoon. Her legs felt like they were trying to remember a dream and she let them tabulate their own kind of data until they were reassured.\n\nAt the turn by Central Street, a car honked a friendly honk and it was Ray, arm hanging out the window like a flag, driving an absurd minivan that had the secrets of a dozen field trips welded to its chassis. He leaned across and shouted something about \u201cworms\u2019 summer camp,\u201d and she laughed and nodded and ran on, lighter for it. At the next block she had the odd sensation of being watched from the wrong angle, and when she glanced she saw nothing but a kid on a scooter and a woman carrying a fern as if it were a child and a man with the posture of someone who had decided to be sad in public. The feeling took a few steps to shake. She tucked it into the place she kept things that might not be real and she ran anyway.\n\nAt home, water tasted like the best part of the day. Ivy had made a late lunch of things that were shapes: triangles of toast, coins of cucumber, a pile of squares that had been cheese before she made them into jokes. They ate and read Ambrose\u2019s email again because it kept changing as their capacity for worrying changed. Ivy had started a list titled Names For Goats and then crossed that out and written People We Are Not Becoming, which included: someone who yells at referees at children\u2019s games, someone who keeps their nails long for typing, someone who pretends they don\u2019t cry at parades, someone who says artisanal twice a day, and someone who calls pie a \u201cjourney.\u201d\n\nThe evening brought with it the blue that makes windows into mirrors. Nell sat with her notebook open and did not write her story that had been assigned because she had borrowed all her adjectives for the day and did not want to be in debt to herself. She wrote instead three sentences about a girl who had excellent lungs and no use for them and then crossed the sentences out because they were not hers. The ribbon had moved again on its own, this time to the back of a chair, a small red insinuation that character had been awarded. It made the apartment look like a room you might warn a guest about even as you offered it.\n\nWhen the knock came, it was not dramatic. It was a polite little fingerprint of noise. Ivy went to the door with the deliberate gait of someone who is back in a play and put one eye to the peephole and then hissed, \u201cVera,\u201d and opened it with her whole face. Vera stepped in with her coat unbuttoned and a look in her eye that meant either someone had died or someone had done paperwork. She held up a printed piece of paper with the posture of a witch displaying a prophecy.\n\n\u201cThe health inspector report,\u201d she said, in a tone that made both of them momentarily stupid. \u201cWe got a B. The part where I place my faith in bleach and heat has been found lacking in a corner I forgot existed. I will fix it by breathing on it properly. But\u2014there\u2019s a note. An anonymous tip to revisit storage because \u2018a competitor in an eating competition has been seen practicing on premises.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that the sentence.\u201d\n\nThey read the sentence a second time because it slid off the brain the first. The words anonymous tip carried with them the smell of letters cut out of a magazine and glued to a threat, even if in reality it was probably an email written from a phone on a toilet. Ivy hissed through her teeth without meaning to because Ivy\u2019s body had always spoken before her mouth could. Nell felt the heat rise up her neck in a way she believed was visible to satellites.\n\n\u201cJulian,\u201d Ivy said, not bothering to dress it as a question because she had always been at her best when assuming things about people she disliked.\n\n\u201cOr the cousin. Or the lady with the pinched mouth. Or Mrs. Dalrymple because she thought she was doing her civic duty. Or a person who enjoys being relevant,\u201d Vera said evenly, because assuming takes a particular kind of fuel and she was saving hers for scrubbing the corner.\n\n\u201cI can stop,\u201d Nell said, and heard how quickly she had allowed herself to become smaller in the face of a small thing. \u201cI can keep it out of your room.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can be seen for ten years eating so much as a grape on these premises for all I care,\u201d Vera said, her mouth making a shape that had not been used yet today. \u201cThat is not the point. The point is that the world will always tell you that your jokes are a threat to their refrigerators. If a man were training to drink seventeen beers in our back room for a money prize, they would call it a fundraiser and make shirts. We will clean. We will pass. We will be boring in exactly the way one has to be boring to keep being interesting. But I wanted you to see it and decide whether you wanted to give someone the satisfaction of changing your shape.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Nell said, and felt the pronoun like a plank she could stand on. \u201cBut I also don\u2019t want to be the reason your pushpin wobbles.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not the wobble,\u201d Vera said, and put the paper on the table like a thing they would eat for dinner just to prove a point. \u201cI want you to know there will be days in August when some anonymous cousin will think their text defines you. It doesn\u2019t. The only thing that defines you is how you put your hand on the table when you\u2019re sure or scared. I have watched you do both. That is my report.\u201d\n\nThey drank tea like old men with opinions and made a plan to flush the corner with vinegar and hot water and the force of their combined competence. Vera left with the paper rolled in her fist like a wand. Ivy stood at the door with the old broom in her hand like a weapon and then laughed at herself and leaned it back into its corner. Nell went to the window and looked out at the street where the elm dropped whatever it was dropping these days and felt a steadiness land in her feet like a friend sitting down.\n\nLater, in bed, she reached for her phone because bad habits are also nests and checked a new wave of messages. There was one from Ray: You okay? With a photo of a worm someone had drawn a face on. There was one from Tina: That cousin is a spoon with opinions. Let\u2019s go for a run sometime that is not about vomiting. There was one from a number she did not know that said only, They don\u2019t deserve you, which made her laugh because it is a sentence that does not mean anything and sometimes is exactly the one you need. There was one from Ambrose: Sorry about the tip. I will weaponize my pens. The goat remains on surveillance. And there was one from Marta: Tomorrow, grass. Bring your ridiculous socks. Eat dinner that feels like ballast.\n\nShe set the phone facedown and lay there with her hands on her stomach and felt, in a way she could not have the day before, both full and hungry in the usefully literal and the complicated metaphorical ways. She thought of the brewery that used to be a factory that used to be a field that used to be a river and imagined herself under its lights with a towel and a heart that was not afraid of being funny in public. She thought of the Providence course and the way it curved like a promise around the last hill. She thought of Julian\u2019s sunglasses jostling uselessly on the top of his head, and of Vera\u2019s scowl that was love, and of Ivy\u2019s list of people they were not becoming, and of her mother\u2019s candle that would still be burning low on the kitchen table long after midnight because someone had needed to light it. She let herself fall into sleep like a person who had decided, briefly, that the door could stay open without a draft.Chapter Seven\n\nFog draped Stoughton in the kind of gauze that makes edges shy. Nell ran into it the way a person walks into a room and waits for their eyes to learn the furniture. The early air tasted like someone had wrung out a washcloth over the town, and the sidewalks took their mischief seriously, heaving up where maple roots had conspired and smoothing out where a winter patch job had learned to be polite. She tried out the new word in her list without giving it the dignity of a place. Mailbox, stop sign, elm, bench, war memorial, pie. It was a joke and a dare and it sat between the others as if it had always belonged there, like a cousin at Thanksgiving who brings the good rolls and gets forgiven for everything else.\n\nCoach Marta had written in her text the night before: tempo, light, keep your shape. Nell translated it into the language her legs understood, which wasn\u2019t words so much as a low hum under the skin. She warmed up along the track with Jess narrating someone else\u2019s drama at full volume and Nora doing her funny little pre-run hop that looked like a ritual she would deny if asked. Marta stood with her stopwatch and her mouth in a line that could mean anything from congratulations to funeral, which was comforting because you could not be singled out by a line. The grass along the infield had been trimmed in obedient rows, short enough to show off the divots like bad decisions, and the sky was a flat sheet of paper someone had forgotten to write on.\n\n\u201cFour by twelve,\u201d Marta said, pitching her voice so it landed in their bones, not just their ears. \u201cOn the minute. I want polish, not bravado. You are not auditioning for an audience. You are scrubbing your own kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that personal,\u201d Jess asked, deadpan and brave, and Marta gave the half-smile she rationed out like a teacher who knows praise is currency and inflation is real. Nell shook out her arms and caught the eye of a freshman she didn\u2019t know yet, a small face under a too-big ponytail. The girl looked at Nell\u2019s shoes as if they might answer a question. Nell said hi because you always say hi when somebody looks to your shoes for instruction.\n\nThe first twelve hundred felt like someone had mopped the track and left it damp. Her stride had been fiddled with by the week, but it settled under her like a cat that likes you but only on its terms. On the back stretch Jess breathed like a person telling a secret and Nora\u2019s feet made a rhythm that could beat out the boundaries of a song. Nell found the line between ease and effort and put her hand on it, polite but firm. She had the ridiculous moment\u2014mid-second lap\u2014where the hiccup memory from Riverbend visited with the cheerfully malicious air of a relative. She did what Vera had taught her without breaking pace, tongue to the roof of her mouth, breath deep and low, the smallest permission to relax where everything wanted to clench. The hiccup considered her and went away the way certain men do when you meet their gaze without apology.\n\nBetween repeats, Marta came down the line like a conductor, tap to shoulder, a syllable for each of them: light, hips, patience, you\u2019re fine, you\u2019re not dying, stop bargaining. When she got to Nell, she was almost gentle. \u201cYour arms are telling on you,\u201d she said, and Nell looked down at the swinging motion she thought she had tamed. She dialed it down on the next one, made the swing small enough to belong to a person who didn\u2019t need to prove she owned her shoulders. The third twelve hundred hurt with the familiar moral clarity of a thing you chose. On the fourth, she felt the little engine that lived between her ribs engage, and it was the particular relief of something you have repaired working in public.\n\nThey cooled in a loose parade while Marta timed a boy with a chest like a narrow boat and pretended she did not know they watched each other when they pretended not to. Deion from the throwers ambled past with a discus cradled like a dinner plate, and shouted, \u201cPie-face!\u201d as if he\u2019d been waiting to be the first one to use it to her actual face and wanted the credit. Nell bowed her head and accepted the baptism with what grace she owned and Jess made a cawing noise that meant approval and mockery in equal parts. The freshman came up shyly when Marta went to consult her clipboard, and tilted her body in that way of girls who want to ask without asking.\n\n\u201cWas it\u2026fun,\u201d the girl said, and the word fun did not sound unserious in her mouth. It sounded like something she was inspecting for cracks.\n\n\u201cIt was.\u201d Nell did not qualify it, even though every sentence in her life had been lately dressed in disclaimers like sweaters. \u201cAnd it was gross, and I counted my breaths, and I loved the people around me more than I love them on a normal Tuesday. Those things can all be true.\u201d\n\nThe girl nodded with the face of someone filing away a piece of instruction for a future use that would not be what the instructor intended. Nora slung an arm around Nell\u2019s sweaty shoulders and spoke as if her voice were a megaphone. \u201cOkay, pie assassin, come eat real food,\u201d she said. \u201cCoach made me promise not to offer you anything that isn\u2019t on the list and I will honor that by exactly fifty-one percent.\u201d\n\nThe day proceeded with the indignities and tiny uplifts that make up most days. She stopped at Dovetail because the pull was muscle memory now, and because Vera had texted a photograph of two storage shelves labeled with that precise neatness that cowed inspectors: flour, sugar. There was a little laminated sign, new and earnest, that said Training area: dish pit and nowhere else, which made Nell laugh in a way that was a little bit like crying. Vera was in conference with a man whose badge said Health in a font that didn\u2019t make it look trustworthy, and she was nodding at a speed that signaled irritated cooperation. He took a temperature with an instrument that looked like it had been designed to interrogate astronauts and affixed a new sticker to the inside of the dish washer with a ceremonious pat.\n\n\u201cWe are so clean I could be convicted,\u201d Vera said, when he had left and the door had done its jingle that was less a jingle than a shrug. \u201cHow is running.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a thing that shows you what you\u2019ve been lying about,\u201d Nell said, and they stood in the calm that follows a health inspection, which is similar to the calm that follows a small storm when you are still counting up your roof shingles.\n\nAmbrose had left a paper bag with his name written too carefully on the top and a drawing of a goat in the corner. It contained an unholy number of pens and a note that said, The committee would like our finalists to submit a thirty-second introduction video. You, your towel, no props, your voice, no goats. Consider this your homework. He had underlined no goats twice and drawn a tiny goat under the second underline as if to apologize to himself. Ivy came in while Nell was staring at the note like it was a small animal and immediately tried to put one of the pens in her hair like a barrette.\n\n\u201cYou will puncture your brain,\u201d Vera said, with sisterly patience she had learned for this family.\n\n\u201cMy brain is resilient,\u201d Ivy said, and then in a different voice to her sister, a voice that contained more private ground, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be on people\u2019s phones. Are we going to let them in, or are we going to stand in the doorway and make them take their shoes off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be anyone\u2019s welcome mat,\u201d Nell said, which was true and not dramatic, and Ivy kissed her elbow in a way that sounded like an agreement.\n\nThey did the thing the note asked in the back alley behind Dovetail, because Vera had declared the kitchen itself off-limits to amateur cinema and because the light in the alley at that hour made everyone look like they had slept. Ivy stood on a milk crate to get the angle she insisted was flattering and scolded a recycling bin for thinking it had the right to be in the frame. Nell tried three versions of herself in thirty seconds: clipped and competent, careless and funny, sincere to the point of embarrassment. The clipped one sounded like she was auditioning to be Ambrose. The careless one tasted false even as the words came out. The sincere one made Ivy put her hand over her mouth in the way people do when they hear a note that hits something in their teeth.\n\n\u201cI hate that one,\u201d Nell said, because hating it was part of its honesty.\n\n\u201cSend it,\u201d Ivy said, and Vera, hovering under the pretense of wiping a clean counter, nodded once like a vote cast.\n\nAt the track that evening, a local reporter materialized at the fence with a notebook and a face that had learned how to be friendly for a living. The paper was a tidy thing that did births and obituaries in their correct boxes and had room on Wednesdays for a column about pets who needed sweaters. The woman called Nell\u2019s name through the chain link in a way that came so close to respect that it would have been rude to ignore. Marta appeared beside Nell like a summoned angel whose toys include clipboards and glances that make cameras flinch.\n\n\u201cTwo minutes,\u201d Marta said, and the reporter adjusted in real time, collapsing paragraphs into something that could fit between stretches. \u201cWe are on a plan. We respect plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the reporter said, pleasant and doomed. She asked the questions everyone had landed on because they seemed to arrange themselves into a narrative without anyone working too hard: running and pie, discipline and silliness, whether she was trying to prove something to herself or to pie. Nell answered with the truth she could afford to share on a weekday. It was fun. It was ridiculous. It was hers. The reporter asked if she thought it was fair to the other runners, the ones who weren\u2019t filling their stomachs with pastry, and Marta answered that one for her with a smile that had lost its innocence decades before. Fair has never been invited to this sport, she said, and the reporter wrote it down with a grateful shoulder.\n\nIt was not until she was walking home alone, later than she\u2019d planned and with the light already folded under the houses, that the day offered her its dose of unasked-for narrative. A car idled at the stop sign by Central with its windows down and a song spilling out that had been popular ten summers ago. She would not have noticed it because cars idle and songs spill, but the car did the thing cars do when they are not sure whether to turn right or to stare. She cut across onto her street and it slid forward the way a insect glides along a rim. It could have been nothing. It was most likely nothing. But nothing does not lift the hairs on your arms like fact.\n\nShe kept her pace the way Marta taught them to keep their form in the last thirty meters when everything in them wants to bargain on the new terms of fatigue. She did not take out her phone because phones glare when you need them to be discreet. She counted the shadows on the sidewalk and wished none of them were hers. When the car turned down a cross street without signaling, something in her chest downgraded its alarm from siren to clock. On the corner where the store that used to sell records now sold seven versions of the same scented candle, Ray\u2019s absurd minivan pulled up to the curb with a squeal that had a personality.\n\n\u201cHardwick,\u201d he called, leaning over the passenger seat like a kid at the beach, \u201cdo you know anything about an earthworm exhibit that refuses to be contained in one classroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I know who would use the phrase \u2018earthworm exhibit\u2019 as if it\u2019s an escaped lion,\u201d she said, and her voice came out warmer than her skin felt. He was already half out of the car, letting a fifth grader\u2019s soccer ball roll like a round dog under the brake. He followed her gaze to where the car had been and found it full of nothing.\n\n\u201cYou good,\u201d he said quietly, because some men know when to lower the volume without being told by a woman to do it.\n\n\u201cI got to practice being paranoid responsibly,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Tell your worms I respect their organizing principles.\u201d\n\nHe grinned and made her tell him about the goats again and she did, because telling stories that end in laughter is a way to make a street belong to you after you have spooked yourself on it. When she got home, Ivy had piled two oranges and a sad apple into a bowl in the middle of the table like a still life that would be graded. She listened and frowned and put the apple back in the fridge as if this could reverse the omen. They locked both locks and then they laughed at themselves and then they didn\u2019t, because both could be true.\n\nThe anonymous tip to the health department turned out to be the first in a set, the way one ant at a picnic becomes a map if you stand still long enough to watch it. Vera found a review on a site beloved by aunts and men who work in offices, claiming with confidence that Dovetail had \u201clet standards slip, probably because of\u2026you know,\u201d which would have been funny if you didn\u2019t work there or love someone who did. Ivy printed it and wrote under it, in pen so thick the paper wrinkled, \u201cyou know is the name of my lawyer,\u201d and taped it to the underside of their kitchen chair where talismans went when you lived in a place that didn\u2019t respect altars.\n\nTina met Nell on the conservation trail two afternoons later, when the weather had decided to be kind and you could pretend the bugs were music. Tina always looked like a person having the best idea in the room and deciding not to mention it because it wouldn\u2019t help. They ran side by side and did not pretend not to judge each other\u2019s cadence. At the boardwalk, Tina asked about Julian with polite interest that could easily turn into amusement if given permission.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of man who thinks a handkerchief counts as a personality,\u201d Nell said, and Tina snorted and scared a dragonfly into a new path.\n\n\u201cI used to date a handkerchief,\u201d Tina said. \u201cHe destarched himself and became a towel and that was better. There\u2019s a rumor he\u2019s got a cousin who handles his entries. There\u2019s a rumor he\u2019s trying to finagle a sponsor by making a fuss wherever he goes. There\u2019s a rumor he doesn\u2019t like to lose to women, which is a rumor you can have about any man without straining your imagination. The useful part is that he wants attention, and wanting it is the same as rehearsing your own downfall.\u201d\n\n\u201cUseful,\u201d Nell said, and tucked it away like a spare safety pin.\n\nThey talked about bodies then, the way you do when you are running away from other people\u2019s opinions about your body, which is to say they compared notes about salt and sleep and the way your stomach sometimes turns into a person on a picket line. Tina told her how the year she turned thirty she stopped counting calories and started counting the number of times she laughed so hard she had to bend over, and how the second number brought the first into line without anyone asking it. Nell told Tina about a notebook she had kept when she was twelve where she listed everything she had eaten that day on paper shaped like a flower, and how the petals had felt like scolding and pretty at the same time.\n\nThey parted at the little parking lot where a pickup with a broken tail light had been parked so long it had become part of the scenery. The driver had drawn a smiley face in the layer of dust that lived on its hood, and someone else had added a mustache to it. The world retained its capacity for harmless vandalism in every season.\n\nHer creative writing professor had returned her last story with a sentence at the top that was two compliments in a trench coat and one complaint with its hands on its hips. Overwrought in an earnest way, he had said, the same broadcast he had offered in a different unit, as if repetition would make it less annoying. She read it to Ivy in the kitchen while they cut bread in indecently thick slices and buttered it the way their father had taught them, like a person trying to make a mistake permanent. Ivy raised a hand to interrupt and announced that the only over-wrought thing in this apartment was the lamp cord she had failed to repair three times. They performed a little ritual where they threw the professor\u2019s name into the air like salt and then they ate their bread and the critique tasted faint and far away.\n\nAmbrose texted that the video had been deemed acceptable by the powers that be, and that someone at the network had declared Nell\u2019s face \u201ctruthful,\u201d which she decided to accept as a compliment even though it sounded like a charge in a court case. He said somebody wanted to come to Dovetail to get b-roll of her doing something that looked like \u201ctraining,\u201d and Vera replied from three exclamation points away with a list of thirteen activities that would not occur in her kitchen while a camera was present. It was negotiable, the way all things are when you have already decided who you are in the room.\n\nThe week staged itself into shape. Nell learned how to look at the ribbon without thinking of the goats. She added yardage the way you add water to a sauce and hope no one will notice. Marta caught her on a Wednesday almost-smile after drills and unbent her mouth into a real one with a story about a time she had tried to be cool in front of a triple jumper and sprained dignity instead. The anonymous rain let up for a day and then returned with a comment on a message board that said, Pies are for grandmas, not athletes, which made Nell laugh so hard she had to hold her ribs while Ivy printed it and taped it to their toilet seat at a perfect angle.\n\nThen there was the email that came not from Ambrose, or Marta, or any person whose name she could picture, but from an address that contained the words manyeyes and truth in a way that made her shoulders climb. It said only, You\u2019re not as good as you think you are, and the subject line was a quote from an obscure country song her father had liked that went, You can\u2019t outrun your appetite. Ivy was the one who opened it first because she had gotten to the phone in that fast way she had of always arriving at trouble a second before anyone else. She did not show Nell until after she had made a noise in the back of her throat that would have worried a doctor.\n\nThey stood with it on the screen as if standing could make it less true or less false. Nell read it twice because once never did anything for her. She looked out the window where the elm had appointed itself a parliament and where the same man who wore the same hat at the same time every day walked by with his small dog and his big opinions. She put the phone down on the counter as if it contained heat, which, technically, it did.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m good,\u201d she said, eventually, when the air had cooled around them. \u201cI know when I am capable of landing inside my own body. I know the smell of it. I know when I\u2019ve cheated myself. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re good,\u201d Ivy said, still looking at the email as if it would blink first. \u201cBut even if you weren\u2019t, you are ours.\u201d\n\nThey wrote manyeyes into a notebook under a list titled pests and drew a little cartoon of a raccoon next to it. When she went to Dovetail that afternoon, Vera slid a thick manila envelope across the counter as if they were in a movie where someone was about to be recruited for a job they didn\u2019t want. Inside were laminated copies of permits, a copy of the health inspector\u2019s new gold star, and an index card with two phone numbers written in a handwriting that brooked no debate.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this,\u201d Nell said, holding the stack like a child holds homework she thinks might explode.\n\n\u201cThis is me deciding I will be boring with such determination that no anonymous weasel can pry me loose,\u201d Vera said. \u201cAlso, if anyone calls you to ask for comment, you say, \u2018No thank you, please direct all queries to Vera Mercier, proprietor,\u2019 and you hand the phone to me or you hang up and run a mile in a rage which you will then report to Marta like a penitent. I will be the stern one. You may go be ridiculous when the time calls for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already are the stern one,\u201d Nell said, and the relief she felt made her want to put her head down on the counter.\n\nThe Providence course map arrived in her inbox in a PDF that had been designed by someone who loved arrows in a personal way. It curved in the lower quad like a sentence that wanted to be rewritten. The finish line looked benign. Experienced runners had written in the comments about a false flat and a corner that encouraged hubris. Marta printed it in grayscale and wrote her name at the top in a marker that tasted like exams. They sat over it at the community center while a Zumba class thumped on the other side of the partition and talked about splits and tactics and what to do when your stomach remembers it has opinions in the last mile.\n\n\u201cYour job is to arrive at the hill with enough brain to leash the beast inside you,\u201d Marta said, circling a bend like she could rub it into submission. \u201cYou will want to go early because you are arrogant and stubborn and a snake-charmed by small children yelling. You will wait. You will make yourself bored at precisely the moment other people forget how to. Then you will choose when to be interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how to be boring,\u201d Nell said, and both of them laughed because she didn\u2019t.\n\nSaturday brought a block party to their street uninvited, the kind of event that arrives because one neighbor owns a speaker and another owns an extension cord and neither of them believes in quiet. There were hamburgers that tasted like nostalgia and handshakes that had been forgotten and rediscovered after three beers. A girl from the team braided Ivy\u2019s hair into a crown that made her look like a capable martyr. Someone\u2019s cousin grilled corn in its husk, and a toddler staggered by in a shirt that said Born to Nap and proved it in public. Mrs. Dalrymple insisted Nell tell the story of Riverbend to her bridge partner, who had hearing aids turned up so loud that every word sounded like a fax.\n\nAround dusk, when everyone had pretended they weren\u2019t watching the sky, someone lit a string of lanterns that made the block look like a movie set built for a scene where two people admit something on a stoop. Mom came out with a plate of cookies that were the same recipe they had eaten around bad tables and good ones. She handed one to Nell and one to Ivy and kept one for herself and they leaned on the porch railing and ate in synchronized gulps. Mom bumped Nell\u2019s shoulder with her shoulder like they were schoolgirls and said, without preface, \u201cWhen I was your age, I used to eat whole lemons with salt. Nana said it was because I wanted to feel something I could control. She was right. I would eat one now if I still had teeth that felt like they belonged to me. You can borrow any of mine, if you want them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your teeth,\u201d Nell said, and then, because she had been raised by this woman to recognize the shape of what was underneath, \u201cI will take your salt.\u201d\n\nMom nodded as if a transaction had been completed. The lanterns hummed faintly with bugs and the light made everyone\u2019s skin look a little kinder. Across the street, someone put on a song from their own adolescence and four people made the same noise at the first chord.\n\nLater, when the block had fallen into the stage of a party where every action must be announced because nobody hears anything that isn\u2019t laughter, a man she didn\u2019t recognize stopped at the bottom of their steps. He had the posture of somebody who had never met his own spine, and a haircut that believed it was time to be worn unironically again. He said her name the way telemarketers do, with a question mark tucked in, and then smiled when she didn\u2019t step down.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s busy,\u201d Ivy said from the top step, without waiting for context because being reasonable had never been her hobby. The man held out a card with a little flourish and Nell took it without moving her feet. It said something about content and brand in a font that did not look sincere on any document not printed onto a mug.\n\n\u201cWe could do something that respects your journey,\u201d he said, and the word journey made the blood in her cheeks do jokes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to do something that respects our trash can,\u201d Ivy said, tilting her head toward the receptacle in a way that read as both invitation and threat. Vera, coming up the walk with a bowl she had bullied someone into letting her carry, looked as if she might absorb this man into her apron pocket out of a sense of public hygiene. He retreated with a shrug that suggested nothing was ever really a no if you just pronounced your own name confidently. The card lay on the porch in the lost-and-found category of objects that await a wind with taste.\n\nThat night, lying in the heat that had not left the apartment even though all the windows were open and even though the elm had done its whispering, Nell thought about the word brand and had the petty pleasure of dismissing it. She thought instead about the hill at Providence and about a brewery with too much light and a goat under surveillance. She thought about her mother\u2019s salt and Ray\u2019s worms and the laminated permits tucked in a manila envelope that Vera had left under their couch on purpose because you hide the important things where you trip over them when you clean. She fell asleep to the sound of Ivy making a list aloud in the next room\u2014towels, safety pins, gum, socks, a bag for the bag, a pen for Ambrose so we can stop looking at his ears\u2014and the cadence of it was as comforting as any prayer they had stopped saying.\n\nOn Sunday morning, she woke to find a flyer slid under their door, the kind printed in gray on pink paper like a blush. It advertised a community talk at the library: Food, Fitness, and the Female Body, the kind of panel that promises truth and delivers a lot of disappointment with cookies. At the bottom there were three names, one of which was a nutritionist whose website had a stock photo of a woman laughing at a salad, one of which was a yoga instructor who did crow pose in parking lots for clout, and one of which made the skin at the back of Nell\u2019s neck prick like a cat\u2019s when the doorbell rings. Julian Pike. He had appended, in parentheses, competitor and advocate.\n\n\u201cThe audacity,\u201d Ivy said, appearing over her shoulder with her hair in two terrible braids. \u201cHe\u2019s going to come into our library and mispronounce metabolism for the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Nell said, and they both laughed at her because the part of her that loved the world enough to hope for fine had never learned the right time to be quiet. She folded the flyer and put it under a magnet shaped like a pear and looked at it as if looking could make a plan. Vera would go, certainly. Marta might go just to practice clenching her jaw. Ambrose would go if the pens could be justified as costs. Nell wanted very much not to go and felt, at the same time, an itch to fill a chair in the back and know what was being poured into the air they breathed. She liked to be where the weather was made.\n\nShe laced her shoes and went to the track because boring was the thing she had promised herself, and boring sometimes requires attendance. The sun had decided to skip ahead to August and the rubber gave off its ghost of tar. On the back stretch she met Tina, who had the flyer folded into a plane and launched it at the lane lines without asking permission from either physics or the library. It bounced once and fell at their feet with a heavy accuracy.\n\n\u201cYou going,\u201d Tina asked, and her voice was the conversational equivalent of lacing your fingers with someone\u2019s under the table.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Nell said, which was honest and a dodge. \u201cIt smells like trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Tina said cheerfully. \u201cLet\u2019s go anyway and be mealy-mouthed and civilized and then laugh in the parking lot. Bring Vera as weaponry. Bring Ambrose if we want a record. Bring Ray for the worms. Bring your mother because sometimes the only defense against a cousin is a woman who can bake a stew.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need name tags,\u201d Nell said, and they ran, and she allowed herself for five full minutes to think only about the feel of her own breath and the line of her own knee, which is the oldest freedom she knew.\n\nThat afternoon, Marta texted with a picture of a broccoli stalk arranged on a plate to resemble a tree and the caption, Practicing my diplomacy. Ambrose texted an image of a goat with a monocle and the words, Library appropriate. Vera answered the group thread with the sentence, We will be polite until we are not, which struck everyone as a reasonable mission statement for attending any event within town limits. Ivy made a sign and then threw it away because it contained a pun she could not live with.\n\nThe library\u2019s community room had the charming acoustics of a cereal box. The chairs were set in patient rows, the fluorescent lights made everyone\u2019s skin look like it had been smeared with the same beige, and a table at the back offered coffee and cookies that were valiantly trying to be good news. The nutritionist laughed at a salad on her slide deck and used terms that made Marta shift in her seat like a woman being bitten by friendly ants. The yoga instructor spoke about intention and invited the room to breathe, and Vera breathed in the way of someone who would not be told when to breathe by a person in a borrowed scarf.\n\nJulian was late enough to be proud of it. He came in with the woman with the pinched mouth and walked to the front with the carriage of a man who\u2019d once been applauded by a room where applause meant a thing. He said the words competitor and advocate as if they had weights attached that only he could lift. He essayed a little speech about discipline and grit and the sanctity of a pure body that made Nell\u2019s molars ache, and when he got to the part where he started a sentence with, \u201cAs a man, I\u2014\u201d the woman with the pinched mouth, who turned out to be his cousin and not his girlfriend, touched his forearm with a warning so elegant it was almost literature. He swerved, gracelessly, and landed on a platitude that made the room relax because platitudes are harmless even when they intend harm.\n\nNell sat in the back with Vera on one side and Ivy on the other and Ambrose behind them, taking notes with a pen that made no sound. Marta fulfilled her role by scowling with purpose. Ray leaned in the doorway like a peacekeeping force that had taken an oath to be funny only at appropriate times. There came, as there always does, a moment for questions, and a lady from church asked about protein as if it were a nephew. A teenager asked whether she would ever be allowed to like her body or whether she'd spend her whole life renting it to other people\u2019s opinions. The room did a collective intake on that one. The yoga instructor said something about gratitude that was not wrong. The nutritionist said something about labor, and the word landed like an oven door. Julian opened his mouth, and Vera\u2019s hand closed on Nell\u2019s knee under the table with a pressure that said, Be sure.\n\nNell stood up because her legs did it on their own and then she had to find words to match the movement. Her voice sounded like it had walked out into the hallway and turned back to look at her. She kept it simple because complexity is suspect in rooms like this.\n\n\u201cI run,\u201d she said, and her own teammates and her coach and her mother all snorted in their private registers because it was a silly way to begin and also the only true way. \u201cI also sometimes eat pies very quickly, for charity and for a ribbon that means less to the world than it does to me. Both make me pay attention to my body in different directions. Some days I am careful. Some days I am stupid. I am practicing both. I would like the room to remember that women are allowed to be multiple without apologizing and that the only people who get to be purists are monks and even they have soup.\u201d\n\nThere was a small scatter of laughter and a murmur that could have been applause if it had been given permission. Julian smiled with half his mouth in her direction, and Ambrose wrote something down that he underlined, which likely meant he thought it was a joke he could use later. The meeting trickled into the kind of chatter that means everybody is pretending the part that interested them most did not interest them at all, and then the coffee did its job and the cookies disappeared and the fluorescent lights pressed their palms on everyone\u2019s heads and blessed them into the parking lot.\n\nIn the lot, under the elm that had migrated into every scene she cared about, Vera said, \u201cSoup,\u201d like she was testing the word and found it sound. Marta put a hand on Nell\u2019s shoulder and squeezed the muscle there as if testing a bridge. Ivy climbed into the back of Ambrose\u2019s car and announced she was stealing him and his pens, and he smiled with his shoulders and handed Vera a pen because he was learning. Ray said something about earthworms that made the yoga instructor laugh for the first time all night in a way that did not sound like it had been purchased.\n\nThey went home by the long way, past the bakery, past the lamplight that makes certain porches look like place settings, and past a window where a couple were arguing quietly in the way of people who know better than to be honest loudly. Nell felt the day settle into its layered self. There was a hill to be climbed in Providence and a camera to humor in a brewery and a pantry corner to keep clean in perpetuity. There was a cousin with a mouth and a man with sunglasses and a town that would be small forever and large in exactly the ways that mattered. She slid the ribbon out of its place on the chair and hung it on a nail in the hallway where her bathrobe used to be, and the sight of it there made it more ordinary and therefore more hers.\n\nBefore bed, she took out her notebook and wrote the kind of sentence she would have rolled her own eyes at three months ago: I am allowed to care about stupid things. Then she wrote, in smaller letters, I am not allowed to be cruel to the person I was before I cared. She shut the notebook gently because people in apartments could feel it when you slammed things, and she lay in the dark listening to the hum the building made when everyone was sleeping and some machine we never think about was still doing its job. In the morning she would go to the track and count her breaths and count her triggers and say the word pie somewhere where it didn\u2019t belong until it learned to, and the day after that she would learn something else about how to be bored until the moment to be interesting arrived and announced itself with a clarity that could not be mistaken for anything but permission.Chapter Nine\n\nRace morning laid itself over Providence like a sheet that someone had ironed with care, the kind that makes you notice the corner where the fabric tucks instead of the whole bed. They left Stoughton in the thin light that makes everything look temporarily holy, dragging breath and bags down the stairs while the elm offered its opinion in the soft rattle of leaves. Ivy packed and repacked the bag in the way of people who believe organization is a spell you have to cast three times before it takes. She narrated the contents for the car as if she were keeping the inventory alive by speaking it: pins, tape, ridiculous socks, gum that tastes like a childhood mistake, towel that is newer than it looks, a bag for the bag which is, I admit, excessive. Their mother pressed a small jar of salted lemon into Nell\u2019s palm like a relic, and Vera texted a photo of a broom leaned against the labored corner of Dovetail\u2019s pantry with the caption, All clean, go be interesting on purpose. Ambrose sent a goat in a singlet with a speech bubble that said, negative split, which was the kind of joke that makes morning easier without requiring you to laugh out loud.\n\nThe highway did its long hum and the signs for exits read like a poem written by regional food, all diners and chowder and towns that keep their secrets. Ivy drove with her whole body, coaxing the car with her shoulder as if it had feelings that could be persuaded. They said almost nothing for fifteen minutes because silence is a luxury in a family that lives the way they do, and then they said too much too fast because nerves are noisy. \u201cBoring until interesting,\u201d Ivy said at one point, as if she were testing the phrase on the air to see if it would stay suspended or sink. \u201cLeash the beast inside you when you get to the hill,\u201d she said a moment later, doing her best impression of Marta\u2019s clipped cadence. Nell smiled because her mouth knew how to do that in any weather, and she let the words settle like ballast in her chest where panic sometimes tried to rent a room.\n\nProvidence was already bustling at the edges when they hit downtown, a particular Sunday buzz of athletes and people who had forgotten their road would be closed and were already composing their disdain. The river looked like a ribbon laid down to prove a point, and the start arch inflated with a wheeze that gave everyone permission to take the day seriously. The team gathered in the agreed-upon patch of grass that had been circled in Marta\u2019s grayscale printout, stretching out like cats, shaking legs like men in rooms where women teach them to dance. Jess narrated the field at full volume, assigning nicknames to people she had never met, and Nora did her tiny hop and proclaimed herself full of gluten and destiny in equal measures. Marta stood with her stopwatch worn high as a sternum and her jaw arranged for usefulness, not comfort, and when she saw Nell she lifted a hand just enough to say, I see you, which did more than any paragraph could have.\n\nBib pickup was a miracle of efficiency for once, and the safety pins found their corners without bloodshed. Someone at the table said, \u201cPie girl,\u201d under their breath, and then apologized for saying it out loud, and Nell felt the odd relief of being identified and the quieter joy of the apology in the same breath. She jogged her warm-up in a rectangle Marta had drawn across the pavement with a sentence about staying out of everyone\u2019s way, and she counted because counting keeps everything else at bay: bark in a crack, chalk X, pothole that looks like a lake in miniature, a man in an orange hat who could have been a lighthouse if he had cared to. The air smelled like coffee spilled on paper and river damp, and the sound of hundreds of people faking calm made a separate hum inside the morning that only runners hear.\n\nOn the line, where tape pretends to be important, Nell felt the old familiar theatre of it settle around her like a jacket that had been made to her measurements. She shook out her wrists because she had decided that was part of the ritual now, and found a piece of sky beyond the arch where there was nothing to look at and looked at it, because empty is sometimes better than faces. Jess leaned over and bumped her shoulder and said, \u201cBored first, interesting later,\u201d as if she were reading off the day\u2019s liturgy, and Nora whispered a sentence so filthy and encouraging that it had to be true, and Marta came down the line and touched two fingers to Nell\u2019s sleeve once, the way piano teachers correct wrists, and then she stepped back and became the person who times, because that is how she writes love letters.\n\nThe horn came and went like weather and the wave pulled them around the first corner with that delicious false feeling that you could do this forever. Nell\u2019s legs felt like instruments she had chosen thoughtfully instead of randomly, and there was room inside her steps for her lungs to be people with opinions without becoming dictators. A man in a shirt that said Eat More Kale shouted, \u201cPie!\u201d in a tone that could have been affectionate or accusing, and she did not turn her head because heads should not be turned on mile one except to avoid a stroller. The false flat did its mischief at mile two and a half, just as the comments section on the course map had promised in its smug way, and you could see the bodies around her learning the difference between what eyes want and what feet know. She kept her shape, which is to say she did not bargain, which is to say she let her arms be quiet and her breath be a metronome that would not be flattered into speeding up.\n\nShe passed the coffee shop where someone had once said a sentence on a first date that made her decide not to love him, and next to it a barber pole that looked like ambition. The river smelled less like itself near the bridge and more like the city, and a woman with a brass bell rang it like she meant to break it, and a little boy in a cape yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re fast!\u201d at everyone indiscriminately because magnanimity is a specialty of certain five-year-olds. The hill announced itself with the necessary lack of drama and then did exactly what a hill is built to do. This was where certain parts of the brain volunteered to be generals and should not be allowed near the map. This was where she remembered the sentence Marta had circled on the grayscale: arrive at the hill with enough brain to leash the beast, and it felt almost ceremonial, the way putting a leash on something you love but do not trust can feel kinder than refusing to love it at all.\n\nHer hiccup ghost showed up right on cue, cheerful and malicious as ever, and she did the thing with her tongue and the roof of her mouth, and she softened her jaw in the way Vera had coached her with the tenderness of someone undoing a knot in a chain. She took the hill like a thing that wasn\u2019t hers yet but could be rented, one installment at a time, and she let the girl in the purple shoes go because purple shoes make bad decisions and then make you pay for their confidence later. Nora yelled her name into the hill\u2019s flank and it was both a command and a celebration, and Jess clapped her hands on the down stroke like a metronome for people who require performance to keep time. At the crest, where the city looks briefly like it could be forgiven for everything, she allowed herself the smallest taste of relief and then put it away like an expensive spice.\n\nThere was the corner\u2014the one that wanted to encourage hubris\u2014and she didn\u2019t let it, which was a small private victory she could keep in her pocket for dark mornings. A man in front of her did what men do when corners tell them they are faster than they are, and he surged and then discovered physics still applied to his life, and she stepped past his small disillusionment with the respect you give a baptism. Her legs began to negotiate with the future, which is always a mistake, and she brought them back to the room with the sternness of a teacher who knows which children can handle a certain kind of stern. She thought once, deliberately and softly, of Riverbend\u2014the clang, the blue on her teeth, the way her body had believed her when she said we are capable of this nonsense\u2014and the memory folded neatly into the space where doubt had been rehearsing.\n\nThe last half mile opened like the end of a long explanation, and she looked for the banner not with desperation but with that keen affection you save for things you have earned in small coins. She heard her name correctly and incorrectly in the mouths of strangers and in the familiar vowels of the people who know the sound a door in their apartment makes. She thought about forcing, and did not. She thought about sandbagging, and did not. She let the beast off the leash for three hundred meters exactly, and it ran in the shape she asked it to, which is as close to love as some of us get in a morning. The line arrived on time for once and she crossed it still herself, which felt like the best outcome the day could have written.\n\nThe clock said what clocks say when you have been boring until it mattered, and Marta\u2019s eyebrows did the small movement that meant she had to respect you against her better judgment. It wasn\u2019t a gaudy personal best that would require you to post about it and pretend humility. It was a clean, shining scrape off a number that had felt welded in place last season, and it was achieved the way she had promised herself it would be achieved: with quiet math and no bargains. She bent with her hands on her knees like a human being, not a hero, and saw in the tops of her shoes the scuffs she collected the way other people collect nicknames. Ivy hit her a second later like a joyful meteor and then reeled back with an apology and then did it again because that was the language they had developed and no one could make them stop speaking it.\n\n\u201cBored until interesting,\u201d Ivy shouted into her hair, which was an insult to any notion of cool and entirely on brand for her. \u201cLeashed, and then not leashed, and then glory. Also your face at the hill looked like you were breaking up with it. I\u2019m proud of you and so is my hair, which I braided with victory and four bobby pins.\u201d\n\nMarta appeared and did not hug because hugging is reserved for certain funerals and once, on a day Nell still tells herself she dreamed. She put a hand where the neck meets the shoulder and pressed like a musician testing a note, and then she nodded and said, \u201cYou chose your moment,\u201d which in Marta is a love poem and a thesis defense in five words. Jess poured water on Nell\u2019s head because she is a child with a sense of theatrical timing and Nora did the math out loud for anyone who wasn\u2019t paying attention: \u201cThat\u2019s twelve seconds. Twelve. Think of all the jokes you can make with twelve. That\u2019s a dozen eggs of triumph.\u201d\n\nThe local reporter with the notebook had managed to find them in the mess without tripping over a single foam roller. She asked Nell how it felt and Nell said the unglamorous truth, that it felt like the person she\u2019d been trying to be showed up instead of the one who likes to make speeches. The reporter asked, in a tone attempting to be light, if pie helped, as if pie were a vitamin, and Nell said, very seriously, that you train your lungs in any number of ridiculous ways and you train your mind to not listen to the wrong part of your body at the wrong moment, and that sometimes those lessons learn each other\u2019s names. The reporter wrote it down as if she didn\u2019t know whether it was quotable, which made Nell like her better.\n\nRay materialized out of a knot of fifth graders who had somehow found their way to Providence like dandelion fluff and handed Nell a worm in a small plastic cup like it was a trophy. \u201cWe\u2019re fostering,\u201d he said with all the gravity the situation demanded, and the children nodded as if they had been sworn in. Tina jogged up with the grim delight of someone who had won a private war with her own knee and kissed Nell on the side of the head, ignoring sweat, which is how you separate friends from colleagues. Vera called to say the health inspector had sent a follow-up email that could be framed and that she was making soup that did not include lectures, and Mom texted a string of emojis she thought were lemons but were in fact moons, which was its own kind of blessing.\n\nThey sat on a curb after awards and consumed oranges with a religious fervor that would have gotten them excommunicated in several centuries. The sunlight did that thing where it makes even plastic cups look honest, and a girl they didn\u2019t know asked Nell for a photo because her niece had watched the pie video and thought she was \u201cbrave in a gross way.\u201d Ivy took the picture and made a show of kneeling like a celebrity photographer while Ambrose, who had drifted over from a different set of obligations, cheered with his inside voice and waggled a pen as if it were a small flag. He gave her a printout she didn\u2019t need but would keep anyway, a schedule with boxes for August and a tiny doodle of a goat in the corner that had inexplicably acquired a medal.\n\nOn the drive back, the car smelled like citrus and accomplishment and sweat the same way kitchens smell like butter and arguments, and they let the radio make poor choices because today did not require them to be discerning. Ivy drove with one hand and used the other to list future meals, which served to keep both of them busy with harmless fantasy. \u201cWe will not go to the supper that is ham and three salads no one eats,\u201d she said, invoking Ambrose\u2019s earlier warning as if it were a parable. \u201cWe will eat soup at Vera\u2019s and then we will lie on the floor and let the ribbon rest on the coffee table like a pet. We will not answer any phone calls that begin with the words \u2018content opportunity.\u2019 We will answer calls that begin with \u2018do you want to borrow a casserole dish\u2019 or \u2018are you awake.\u2019\u201d\n\nBack in Stoughton by late afternoon, the town looked smaller only because their eyes were temporarily full. The elm did its confetti of whatever it was dropping in June, and the neighbor across the hall had taped a note to their door that said, Proud of you, you animals, with a heart that could have belonged to any age. They showered the race off, which is to say they peeled off the layer of self-importance and salt and stood still under water like penitents who believe in plumbing. Then they went to Dovetail because joy has routes and that was one of theirs now, and sat at the back table that had decided to belong to them as if it had voted on the matter.\n\nVera ladled soup into bowls that could have been instruments if you held them right, and she salted them the way only people who have spent time with grief and bread know how. \u201cThere is a dignity to being predictable,\u201d she said, sliding the bowls across, and Ivy saluted with a spoon and said, \u201cTo boring,\u201d which made them all laugh because boring had saved the day. They ate without commentary for several minutes because sometimes the most generous thing you can do is leave food alone. Then Vera pulled a manila folder from under the counter and laid it between them like a card in a game none of them pretended not to be playing. \u201cAugust,\u201d she said, and the word felt less like a month than a room they had decided to step into together.\n\nThey made a plan that was not a plan so much as a principle, and they wrote it down not because ink makes things real but because it allowed them to set the page on the table and look at it, which helps. Marta would be present for the parts of the showcase that pretended not to be practice. Vera would say no to anything that smelled like exploitation with lemon cleaner and a lawyer\u2019s posture. Ambrose would translate production into human and provide pens for signing things that should not be signed. Ivy would steal laminated badges and make a deviled egg platter for after that could be transported in a cooler and could sustain a small army if required. Nell would keep her boring, polish it like a coin, and then spend it only when being interesting bought something worth owning.\n\nThe anonymous pests tried their latest and got nowhere, because the post in the same old font that said, Pie is not a sport, arrived in the inbox like a fly and was swatted by the quiet combined disinterest of four women who had decided to spend their afternoon on soup and logistics. Ambrose read it aloud in a voice that made it sound like a grocery list and then folded it into an airplane and sent it into the trash with so little ceremony it felt like dignity. Ray stopped by on his way to a Little League game and left them three tickets with a note that said, Today, worms learned poise, and Tina texted a photo of her knee with a bandage on it and the caption, Fine, I will ice and be humble, leave me alone.\n\nThat night, they took their soup-heavy bellies to Mom\u2019s and produced their accomplishments as if they were bringing over a casserole. The ribbon lay on the table as always, a joke and a pronouncement, and Mom hung it on the back of a chair as if chairs needed medals, which in houses like theirs they do. She told them a story about a county fair when she was their age where she had eaten six ears of corn because a boy with eyelashes had bet she couldn\u2019t, and she confessed she had never told Nana because Nana would have said, Why do you insist on proving yourself to men who cannot cook, and in that moment the kitchen felt like a genealogy of small rebellions. They ate a second dinner because family is many things but rarely sensible, and after dishes they took a walk around the block so the evening could look at their faces and take attendance.\n\nWhen they passed the library, a poster for another panel was already being taped up by a volunteer who believed tape could do anything. The nutritionist had been replaced on the bill by someone who identified as an activist and who had a haircut that would make Vera hostile. Julian\u2019s name had been removed, perhaps by the wind, perhaps by ink, perhaps by a decision made quietly in a room with no windows. Nell felt the space where his letters had been like the absence of a tooth you cannot keep your tongue off, and then she let the feeling pass like a bus carrying people she did not wish to visit. Ivy pulled her down the steps and said, \u201cYou looked like your brain was about to write a monologue. Save it for the brewery. Or save it for the grocery list. We need eggs.\u201d\n\nIn bed, with the window open to a night that smelled green and slightly burned by the day\u2019s sun, Nell lay on her back and catalogued the new things. There was the number on the clock that would show itself differently to her tomorrow because she had carved at it with her stubbornness. There was the steadier feeling in her middle that had not existed the night after Riverbend because she had not yet learned how to choose the boring in public and be proud of it. There was the knowledge that August would come and she would stand under too-bright lights and do something ridiculous with intention while the people she trusted stood just off camera with soup recipes in their pockets and emergency plans in their shoes. There was her mother\u2019s lemon jar on the sill, sweating its small salt into the night air like a prayer, and there was Ivy in the next room talking to herself as if she were interviewing someone famous and the famous person knew all the same jokes they did.\n\nBefore sleep, Nell pulled her notebook across her belly and wrote down a sentence she wanted to forget and remember at once: Today I cared about the right thing at the right time. Then she wrote, in smaller letters, I will not apologize when the right thing is stupid. She closed the notebook gently, because loud in a house like theirs is a kind of vandalism, and the building hummed its evening hum and the elm did whatever trees do at midnight and her tired legs twitched as if running in place inside the dream they knew was coming. When morning arrived, it would require nothing new of her that she did not already know how to give, which might be the best a life like this could promise.Chapter Ten\n\nAugust had baked the city until the bricks gave off a kind of remembered yeast, which felt appropriate considering the venue. The converted brewery sat on the corner like a man who had gone to college and come back with new glasses; it still knew what it had been, but it wanted you to notice the polish. Inside, the air kept an echo of hops under the new smell of cable coils and coffee that had been made in a hurry. A production assistant with a ponytail like a punctuation mark handed Nell a laminate that said TALENT in a font that tried too hard to be friendly, and Ivy wore hers the way some people wear a cape, sweeping it onto her chest with the same flourish she used on a cardigan. Vera arrived with a canvas bag that thunked when it hit the floor\u2014laminated permits, a stapler that could take a finger\u2014and nodded at the rafters as if to say, I have known worse ceilings. Marta followed in a blazer that wasn\u2019t quite a blazer and a Tupperware of broccoli she had brought to bully herself, and she tucked herself against a column as if surveilling joy had always been included in her job description.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the thing that pretends not to be a circus,\u201d Ambrose said, materializing with two pens in his hair in defiance of Vera\u2019s earlier wishes and five in his pocket that made him look like a magician low on rabbits. He had added a goat sticker to his clipboard with the seriousness of a man taking the sacrament. \u201cWe are calling it a showcase because the network is allergic to the word contest unless there is confetti. This way.\u201d He did his small bounce, the one that made him look as if he had replaced bones with springs, and led them through a maze of black curtains, past a set of lights that appeared capable of tanning a mood.\n\nThe stage put its back to a wall of old copper tanks that had not been removed because history photographs well. Long tables wore fresh butcher paper and, beneath domes, the pies sat like good students trying not to attract attention. There was a mark taped on the floor at each spot like an x that spelled please do not be unpredictable. A woman with a headset and a denim jumpsuit introduced herself as Lark, showrunner, and told them the schedule the way a person tells a bedtime story to a child she does not know: soothing cadence, limited actual hope of sleep. \u201cWe\u2019ll do pre-interviews in the green room\u2014that charming term for a room that is beige\u2014then a walk-through, then we tape,\u201d she said, pointing at a whiteboard that underlined itself with its own marker. \u201cWe aim for the vibe of friendly competition. No humiliations. Try not to bleed.\u201d\n\nThe beige room tried to hold nerves and did not have enough corners to contain them. Somebody had set out a tray of vegetables like a joke and a bowl of candy like an apology. The pre-interview wall was a fake life: a plant that had never been alive, a couch that had seen a thousand brief confessions. A producer with eyebrows like question marks\u2014his name was Noah and he introduced himself with a handshake that suggested somebody had told him firm was love\u2014asked Nell to say her name for the camera and then to say it again as if she believed people were interested. He tried to coax origin myth out of her like the last bit of toothpaste, nudging the story toward fathers or accidents, toward one event that could be spooled into a neat lower-third. Nell answered in the clearest crumbs she could without agreeing to become a moral. \u201cI started as a joke,\u201d she said, and smiled without performance. \u201cIt keeps not feeling like one. I run in circles. I eat in straight lines. Both teach me where my edges are.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny rivalry we should be aware of,\u201d Noah asked, and looked down as he asked it, a trick that always made people say more than they were willing to if they thought the eyes weren\u2019t a witness. Vera\u2019s breath tightened next to her like a zipper. \u201cFriendly or otherwise. Makes for a nice package if there\u2019s someone you\u2019re chasing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI chase myself,\u201d Nell said, and it sounded pretentious in her head and fine when it hit the room. \u201cEveryone else is scenery.\u201d Ivy made a face that she believed read I am a supportive sister and actually read No packages will be made here today, and Ambrose coughed in a way that translated to we will talk later if needed because I have developed a condition called protectiveness.\n\nThey were not the only ones nervous with purpose. Ray strolled into beige with a grin that carried fifth graders on its back and stopped to clap Nell on the shoulder in that way only people who can carry kegs and grief do with the same ease. \u201cI promised the worms I\u2019d report,\u201d he said, and then leaned into the camera when Noah asked him a question and said, with enormous dignity, \u201cI teach science and I don\u2019t like bullies,\u201d which was his way of threading a needle. Tina arrived with a hoodie knotted at her waist and a look on her face like she knew she would end up hugging a stranger before the day was out. Julian appeared as if he were hoping to be mistaken for a lighting fixture, late enough to cause friction, with his cousin behind him like a shadow with agency. He wore sunglasses inside with the confidence of a person who thinks their cheekbones were grandfathered into the building code.\n\n\u201cHardwick,\u201d he said, as if the syllables tasted like a cough drop he wasn\u2019t sure was still good. \u201cNice to see your press has caught up.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy press is a goat,\u201d she said, which made Tina snort and Ray choke on his piece of carrot in a way that required thumping. Julian\u2019s cousin leaned forward just enough to register in the shot, smiled with lips and not eyes, and introduced herself as Mae. \u201cWe handle opportunities,\u201d Mae said. \u201cIf you\u2019re smart, we don\u2019t have to be enemies.\u201d Vera reached into her bag and removed the laminated sheet with regulations on health department rumor and placed it on the coffee table between the plant and a stack of coasters like a hymn.\n\nThe walk-through functioned like a rehearsal for people who refused to admit they were rehearsing. Lark went over the changes from Nell\u2019s last tent: this time there would be three rounds cut into television-friendly slices\u2014a speed round with hand pies that had been weighed within an inch of their lives to ensure fairness, a nine-inch classic for rhythm, and a \u201cregional specialty,\u201d which made Ambrose pull a face because he did not trust anything with adjectives appended by a committee. The camera operator with an old Patriots cap introduced his lens as if it were a dog that shouldn\u2019t be startled. \u201cWe\u2019re live to tape,\u201d Lark added, which meant mistakes could be edited into the illusion of grace later, and everyone unclenched a notch. The horn had been replaced by a plosive chime that someone had decided was less agricultural and more aspirational, and it made a sound like the last note of a hymn in a small church.\n\nBackstage became a city of small rituals. Marta counted Nell\u2019s sips of water in her head and tried not to be obvious about it, the same way mothers do when their children pretend at independence. She pressed a salt packet into Nell\u2019s palm like a coin at a toll booth but did not mention broccoli, because she knew when to let different vegetables have the floor. Vera set out a towel with the kind of precision that makes you think of hospitals, folded into a rectangle that had a rightness to it that even Ambrose didn\u2019t touch. Ivy rotated between hype woman and jester, telling a story about a dream in which she had switched all of Ambrose\u2019s pens for crayons and then everyone had been forced to write kinder emails. Nell found a corner where an old radiator should have been and did her little shoulder circles like a woman trying to persuade herself she deserved her own air.\n\nThey miked her up with tape that made her skin itch and the young man whose job it was to place the mic apologized with a politeness that felt like a hope for absolution in advance. \u201cSound is the only thing that always tells the truth,\u201d he said, and she thought of breath and hiccups and the ways bodies confess whether asked or not. Lark counted them down with two fingers and Nell felt the weird serene click inside herself that had turned up at Providence, an entering into the good boring that presages the moment worth spending. She rolled her wrists, held the water like it was a reasonable luxury, and looked once at the copper tanks, thinking that if you listened hard enough you could hear the old yeast cheering for anyone who did their job on time.\n\nThe hand pies were first and they were wicked little things, designed to deceive a mouth that sought security in routine. The pastry flaked wrong if you went at it with hunger, and the filling behaved like cunning under pressure. Nell found a rhythm that worked in miniature: two bites per pie, a sip every four, a breath through her nose that let her pretend she hadn\u2019t become a circus for twelve minutes. Julian went hard as if gentleness insulted him, and the camera loved him for it because cameras always love boys who look like they might insult a pastry on principle. Tina did her steady miracle and did not get blueberry on her knuckles, which was as much art as running a clean curve. Ray waggled his eyebrows at a child and then ate three in a row so quickly Ambrose made a noise that sounded like a pen breaking.\n\nThe classic nine-inchers came out, apple first as if to reassure the part of the room that believed in tradition, and Nell put her brain back on its leash. Lark\u2019s voice floated over the talkback in a calm that would have soothed misbehaving toddlers, and the chime sounded again and the tables tipped forward and time did its rubber band trick. Nell cut the first wedge with her mouth and thought, absurdly, of the hill in Providence, as if the body kept files that it could reorganize by category: here is endurance in the leg, and here is endurance in the jaw. She was careful on the blue because old syrup had longer arms than anyone admits. She watched the steam behave and counted the corners like landmarks\u2014corner seams, inhale, press, swallow\u2014and promised her stomach she would speak to it gently later when it sent up a memo with the subject line we are not amused. Julian tried his tilt trick and a blueberry escaped his jurisdiction just long enough for camera two to catch it committing minor treason on the butcher paper, and Ambrose\u2019s eyebrows, from the wings, achieved the highest point of their day.\n\nIt was when the \u201cregional specialty\u201d arrived that the gods of television remembered their duty to chaos. Lark had chosen, for reasons that would be argued in kitchens and group texts for a week, a cranberry-streusel with a crust that had something like a personality. It cracked when you looked at it and sighed when you did not. The first bite was forgiveness and the second tried to call your bluff. Nell adjusted to small bites because cranberries want to own your vowel sounds, and let the water take its share without handing over the keys. A light fizzed and popped in the rig above them with a drama that did not affect the shot but required a man with a ladder and a calm face, and while he dealt with his electricity like a therapist with a sense of humor, someone in the third row decided to be helpful and called, \u201cEat!\u201d in a cadence that was all wrong. Ivy made her own rhythm louder than a chant by tapping the palm of her hand on her thigh in the beat Nell had trained herself to love, and the sound cut through the clang of nerves better than the chime.\n\nJulian made his play somewhere in the sixth minute, not with elbows\u2014he was not that foolish with six cameras watching\u2014but with his proximity, edging his plate as if the table belonged to a man who had been taught property at a particular school. He said, conversationally, \u201cIt\u2019s television, you know,\u201d and the stress on the wrong syllable turned television into a warning. Nell did not turn her head because she wanted to keep her neck for a day when her neck would affect an outcome. She put a wedge of cranberry down with the dignity of someone putting a poor conversationalist in a taxi and thought about the copper tank behind her, which had held fermentation without boasting. Vera\u2019s eyes on the side of her face felt like a stiffness you learn to be grateful for where steel holds you up.\n\nThe hiccup arrived like it had been invited by the chime, and it did its small hook at the diaphragm that wanted to write her headline for her: runner ruined by burp, a sentence that would please nobody who loved her. She did what she had been taught, tongue to palate, breath to lower back, jaw gentled like a horse made skittish by bad hands. It went away with a sulk and she kept the wheel straight even as the road tried to slope. She thought of Mrs. Dalrymple\u2019s moons and a goat with a medal and her mother salting a lemon with a certainty that kept the world upright. The cranberry on her teeth tasted like the kind of honesty that stings a little but leaves you clean.\n\nTime did the thing where it announced itself with no precision and then became precise all at once. Lark put up a hand behind the cameras, the chime behaved, and Ambrose did his hawk eyes down the line like a parishioner counting hymnal dents. Plates hit the paper with an almost sexual relief. The applause had the odd weight of a sound designed later to become branding. Lark stepped forward into frame with the composure of a priest in a vest that's a little too shiny and did her summary in a voice that made all of them sound like old friends at a reunion even though some of them had anonymously emailed the health department about each other.\n\nThey counted. Tina had eight and change and shrugged as if to say, I am already proud of the thing that was steady. Ray had ten precise and pointed at a fifth grader in the front row who had smuggled in a worm in a pocket, and the kid did an unlicensed dance. Julian had nine and a sliver he tried to argue into a third with a smile that had gotten him his way elsewhere; Ambrose did a gentle no with his head and his pen at the same time, and Mae pressed her lips together like someone putting a stamp on a letter that would not get answered. Nell had nine and three quarters and a smear of cranberry on her lower lip that would become someone\u2019s screenshot by evening, and when Ambrose announced it, he followed the words, reflexively now, with that tiny knuckle tap to the plate that meant I see the work, which in this building felt like sacrament.\n\nLark declared her the day\u2019s \u201cfeature,\u201d a word that swallowed and spat out the idea of first and made it into content, and the crowd did the noise that television likes because it sounds like redemption even when it is just the release of tension. Tina whooped, delighted in a way that doubled as relief, and Ray put both hands in the air like a referee who has decided to be generous. Julian applauded at a volume his rings could flatter and smiled the half smile he used when saving his whole one for a different room, and Mae adjusted his sleeve like that would smooth the world. Nell felt the ribbon around her neck like a light coin and had the absurd thought, toward the copper, that the old yeast approved of her restraint.\n\nPostgame was always payday for people who don\u2019t like to miss anything. Noah perched on the edge of the beige couch and asked her how much of it was luck, as if luck were a measurement you could pour into a cup. She said the thing she\u2019d learned herself into: it was always luck, and training made it so you deserved it when it arrived. He asked if today made her feel brave, and she said bravery was for actual danger; she was practicing sincerity in ridiculous situations. He asked\u2014softly, as if his voice could get hurt if he pushed it\u2014if there had been a moment where she wanted to quit and she loved him for asking without wanting her to cry on the couch for it. \u201cI wanted to stop every second between three minutes and seven,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I got bored, and boredom is where my body thinks I\u2019m safe.\u201d\n\nOutside, the sky had chosen that industrial blue that cities do best at seven, and the old brick looked yesterday and tomorrow at once. Marta put her hand on Nell\u2019s back in a way that said, doctor\u2019s tears, not coach\u2019s, and gave her an instruction with exactly five words, which had become their ritual: \u201cEat. Complaint later. Shoes off.\u201d Vera stood opposite Lark with her laminate held like a weapon, politely declining a request for \u201ca quick shot in the kitchen\u201d with a speech that began, \u201cThis is not your room,\u201d and ended with, \u201cUnless you\u2019re bleaching the corner, I am busy,\u201d and Lark laughed at herself because she was a person who was learning which nos were yeses to bigger things. Ivy wore two laminates now, one stolen, one given, and she used them to direct traffic as if the job had been invented for her. Ambrose counted his pens and found one on the floor by a coil and looked at it with enough affection to embarrass himself if anyone had noticed.\n\nThey spent their prize money and their adrenaline at a diner two blocks over that had pretended not to redecorate for forty years. The waitress had a voice that could fold a person and she recognized tired on sight, and when she asked what they wanted Ivy said, \u201cYour opinion,\u201d and the woman brought them pancakes and eggs and a piece of pie that Vera permitted like a benevolent monarch. They ate without needing to narrate because each of them owned the same movie and did not require a different angle. The plate squares and the sugar caddy and the sound of silverware doing its small violence brought Nell down into the earth of her own body where awards do not matter and salt does.\n\nWhen they returned to Stoughton, someone had chalked a crooked heart on the sidewalk by the elm and written under it, you live here, which was either nothing or everything. The anonymous pests tried one more time before midnight with a message that said, you are too much, and Ivy took the phone from Nell\u2019s hand and put it on the counter face down like a frog and wrote under a magnet, we are exactly as much as we say, and then she went to brush her teeth with the pomp of a person closing a day properly. Ray texted a photo of a worm habitat in a plastic bin with the caption, They prefer darkness and steady noise, which felt like a metaphor everyone in the room enjoyed too much. Tina sent a picture of her using a bag of frozen peas on her knee with a middle finger faced inward to the part of her that still believed suffering had to be public. Ambrose wrote, Goat pleased, and attached a sketch he had done in biro on a napkin of a goat in a cardigan, and Vera replied with a picture of the broom leaned sweeter than yesterday.\n\nAt the edge of sleep, with her windows open to a night that smelled like the blacktop had finally calmed down, Nell thought about the copper tanks and the way the sound in that room had risen and settled like a boil. She thought about Julian\u2019s half-smile and let it be a footnote, not a headline, and about Mae\u2019s sleeve-tugs, and about Lark\u2019s default kindness, which had been purpose and not posture. She thought about the way Marta had not said proud out loud because proud can be a fragile thing when handled wrong, and how Vera had made a boundary sound like a lullaby, and how Ivy had stolen a laminate as if legitimacy were a physical object you could pocket if you were fast. She wrote in her notebook one sentence that would embarrass her tomorrow and feel true all the same: Today I refused to be simplified at scale. Then she added, in smaller letters, Remember to buy lemons, and closed the book with a care that felt like respect. The building made its sleeve-sound, the elm negotiated with the air, and some part of her that had needed attention settled down like an animal that had been fed and believed the next meal would come.",

                              "content": "On most mornings in Stoughton, before the lawn sprinklers cough awake and the commuter rail shrieks past the mural of the founding farmers, Nell Hardwick is already out, lacing the light through her strides. The sidewalks are uneven at the turns near Central Street; tree roots have lifted the cement here and there, making the whole loop into a small obstacle course only a local would dare to take at a clip. She knows every dip, every patch of shadow, where the smell of pine turns to warm bread when she gets within a block of Dovetail Bakery. On clear mornings like this one, the bakery\u2019s back door is propped open, letting out cinnamon steam and a clatter of trays like coins.\n\nNell measures her breaths to the rhythm of cracked pavement. When she runs she counts, not numbers but triggers\u2014mailbox, stop sign, elm, bench, war memorial, pothole that tried to ruin her ankle last winter. Counting keeps her brain from trying to make lists. It is too early for errands, or for hearing the voices, one of them her own coach\u2019s, telling her that a runner is only as good as her last season, that the 5K is all about patience and the mile is elegantly cruel, that the 10K is a conversation with pain, all of which fuels her when she wants it but keeps her awake when she doesn\u2019t.\n\nShe waves at the bakery as if it were a person, because for seven months it has been. Dovetail, with its brushed steel counters and faults in the floor where the old ovens used to sit, is where she learned\u2014hesitantly, and then in a jolt\u2014that you can be good at something stupid. It started as a dare, one of those wobbly nights last fall when her calf was wrapped in ice and a day\u2019s worth of foiled training had turned into a humiliating nothing. She was washing dishes for a fundraiser at the bakery, up to her elbows in suds with Ivy, her sister, across the bench stacking tins like suitcases, when a guy with an apron the color of egg yolk shouted that they needed one more body at the counter.\n\n\u201cThis is not my scene,\u201d Nell muttered. She had flour on her cheek that she could feel but not find.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just plates,\u201d Ivy said, flicking a piece of lemon zest at her forehead. \u201cOr maybe they want you to be the strong arm. Lift a whole pie tin with your mind.\u201d\n\nAt the counter the owner, Vera with the clipped gray hair and an ear cuff of tiny stars, had smiled into the roil of voices and banged a bell. \u201cWe\u2019re doing an empty-the-rack challenge,\u201d she told the room, not looking at anyone in particular because she was looking at everyone. \u201cFor charity, so if you have robust appetites or a competitive gleam, put your names down. Ten dollars to enter. Winner gets bragging rights and a free pie. Most slices down in five minutes. It\u2019s silly. It\u2019s for fun. No sprinters\u2019 starts, no elbows.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, you,\u201d someone had said, pointing at Nell. \u201cRunner girl. Try it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIvy,\u201d Nell had hissed. \u201cDon\u2019t even.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say it,\u201d Ivy had said, all innocence in her eyes and a smirk in the corner of her mouth. Ivy, twenty-four and reckless in the way people are who have never fallen the wrong way on a wet track. Ivy, whose hair was always escaping whatever tie she used on it and whose earrings never matched. Ivy had already turned to the sign-up sheet with the clumsy marker and written NELL HARDWICK in block letters that did not look like Nell\u2019s hand at all.\n\nNell had sighed in a way that seemed to climb up out of her bones. The air smelled like nutmeg and like the rag she\u2019d wrung out too many times. She could have said no. She could have peeled off her dish gloves and slipped out the back door into a night where rain made halos around street lamps. But the feeling was like the warm-up lap before the gun, a buzz that carried a kind of signal her body knew even if her mind didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cYou know I run on vegetables and coffee,\u201d she had told Ivy, who handed her a paper bib that said FIFTEEN and looked inordinately delighted.\n\n\u201cYou run on spite,\u201d Ivy had said. \u201cAnd pie\u2019s a fruit. Some of it, anyway.\u201d\n\nFive minutes later there was sticky on her wrists and filling at the corners of her mouth and she was laughing. She hadn\u2019t meant to, but there\u2019s an absurd joy in bending your face toward a plate in a crowd of other faces doing the same thing, in the ridiculousness of buzzing lips against sugar, of trying to swallow while giggling. She figured she\u2019d be out after two slices. The crust flaked perfectly and the apples were tart enough to make her eyes squint, but that wasn\u2019t it\u2014she found a rhythm. A bite, two chews, chase with water. Breath through the nose. Bargain with her stomach as if it were a stubborn roommate. Her body, trained to obey the metronome of splits, found the drumbeat in a new song.\n\nShe won that night, to the scandalized delight of Mrs. Dalrymple from two doors down, who had given her the kind of frown that only thin people earn from older ladies who think they should eat more casserole. She won, and then she didn\u2019t know what to do with that win because it didn\u2019t fit the self she carried like a backpack\u2014Practical, Focused, Somewhat Exhausted, Runner Girl. That was how the second dare became a third and then\u2014well. Dovetail had become Saturdays where she\u2019d practice some absurd maneuver like dunking the crust edge in water to soften it without her lungs catching on the wrong swallow. She had become a person with secrets she kept in the back of the pantry behind the protein powder.\n\nShe didn\u2019t tell Coach Marta. How do you go up to a person who wears a stopwatch like it is a wedding ring and say, \u201cBy the way, I discovered that when the pies are blueberry and the temperature is under seventy degrees, I can knock out two full rounds in ten minutes without feeling like an overturned boat\u201d? You do not. Not unless you want to be told a long story about glycogen stores and sabotage-by-sugar. Ivy knew, of course. Ivy had started making her \u201ctraining lunches\u201d even though calling them that made both of them laugh. Oatmeal and slices of melon for morning runs; a bottle of water with salted lemons stuffed into it; sometimes a square of cornbread if they were going to be out past noon. On the days Nell experimented at Dovetail, Ivy sliced cucumber into a bowl and set it on the table like a peace offering. They don\u2019t say grace in the Hardwick house anymore; they say be careful.\n\nThat morning, as Nell cut past the war memorial with its bronze soldier stoic toward the road and his back to Main Street, her phone thrummed in the pocket at the small of her back. She let it ring the first time. Second ring, she slowed to a jog, then a walk, then a halt under the heavy shade of the elm that always dropped seed pods on her head in June. The number was unfamiliar. She swiped instead of tapping because her thumb was a little slick with sweat.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d she said, flatly, because she always sounded annoyed when she was panting.\n\n\u201cNell Hardwick?\u201d The voice was clipped and cheerful in the way of someone who has talked to ten strangers already this morning and will talk to forty more before lunch.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Ambrose Weller from the Commonwealth Pie-Off committee. We met briefly in March at the qualifiers in Brockton. Ms. Hardwick, first, congratulations on placing fourth. Second, I know it\u2019s short notice, but we\u2019ve had a dropout. One of the finalists is out with a dental infection, unfortunately. It\u2019s a mess. Would you be open to taking the slot at the finals this Saturday?\u201d\n\nNell was acutely aware in the next two seconds of the birds in the elm arguing about whose branch was whose. A truck rumbled past on the main road with an unsecured ladder banging against its side, every hit like a drum. Somebody\u2019s wind chime a block away trilled a tin melody. In her mouth, her mouth, the word delicious curled up like a cat. She tried to be sensible. The runner part of her, that schoolmistress with a whistle, said, absolutely not; are you kidding; you have your own race in Providence next month; what would coach say; who is Ambrose Weller anyway and why is he so chipper.\n\n\u201cI\u2014hold on.\u201d She pulled the phone away and stared at the sky. Her heart was already beating like a rabbit from the run, but this added a bright layer, a top note like eeek. She put the phone back to her ear. \u201cSaturday?\u201d\n\n\u201cSaturday afternoon. Two o\u2019clock start. Warm-ups a half hour before. Riverbend Fairgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cRiverbend?\u201d That was an hour away and full of dust. It wasn\u2019t her scene but it was a scene, with food trucks and hand-lettered signs and kids running with balloons until their arms ached.\n\n\u201cYes. Can I put you down? You\u2019re our next qualified, Ms. Hardwick. If you can\u2019t do it I\u2019ll go to number five.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do it,\u201d she said, and then laughed at the way it came out, too fast. \u201cYes. Yes, I can do it.\u201d\n\nAmbrose was already smiling in his voice. \u201cGreat. I\u2019ll e-mail you a packet in an hour. There\u2019s a call for all final participants on Thursday night to review rules and arrangements. Congratulations again.\u201d\n\nHe hung up before she could ask about what it paid or whether she needed to bring her own hand towel. She stood there under the elm, the leaves moving over her like hands, and told herself not to jump. Then she jumped anyway, both feet off the ground, a runner\u2019s hop that called every tendon into service.\n\nShe ran home with the grin stuck to her face, only slowing at the corner where Mr. Hanigan sometimes backed his truck out without looking. She was a little dizzy by the front walk. The Hardwick house smelled faintly of tea, and there was a damp towel slung over the banister like a flag of truce. Ivy was at the kitchen table with a plate of cucumber slices and a smear of peanut butter in a bruised bowl. Her hair looked like she\u2019d tried to organize it with her hands and then given up halfway through.\n\n\u201cNell? Why are you making the face?\u201d Ivy asked, whipping around.\n\n\u201cNo face,\u201d Nell said. She leaned on the doorframe with both hands and tried to make her eyes normal. \u201cFine face. Usual face.\u201d\n\n\u201cNell. Is this about that professor who thought your last story was \u2018overwrought in an earnest way\u2019?\u201d Ivy had taken exactly one creative writing class at the community college years ago and decided that critiquing was an art form best practiced on an unwilling sibling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014this is not a story thing,\u201d Nell said. She grabbed the back of a chair. \u201cI got a call.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bad kind? The hospital?\u201d Ivy\u2019s laugh was immediate and then reeled back, a whoops. You say the hospital as if it lives in your pocket.\n\n\u201cThe good kind. From the Pie-Off. Someone dropped out. They want me in.\u201d She waited for the air to change, and it did. Ivy\u2019s eyes went wide. She brought both hands to her mouth and made the kind of sound that puppy videos on the internet are made for.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding. Are you kidding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you said yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to the finals.\u201d Ivy said the words slowly, tasting them like cake batter. \u201cOh\u2014this is the part where I should be a sensible older sister. Wait, I\u2019m younger. I keep forgetting. This is the part where I should say, \u2018Elle, be careful with your, you know, insides.\u2019 But I cannot be careful in this moment. I am reckless in this moment.\u201d She grabbed one of the cucumbers and tossed it into the air, trying to catch it in her mouth, and hit herself in the forehead instead. \u201cOw.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making me feel like I\u2019m fourteen,\u201d Nell said, but she couldn\u2019t wipe the grin off either. The kitchen seemed suddenly too small. She could see herself in the tiny square of the microwave door, flushed, hair snapping in unruly directions, eyes bright like polished coins.\n\nIvy looked at her with a light behind her eyes that made her look softer than usual. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Riverbend,\u201d she said. \u201cI want a lemonade in a cup so big I can\u2019t hold it. I want us to get sunburned and argue about which goats at the petting zoo are plotting to escape.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all plotting to escape,\u201d Nell said.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Ivy said with satisfaction. \u201cAlso, Ambrose will probably be there in his bright vest, counting heads like ducklings.\u201d She pronounced the name with such precise annoyance that Nell had to laugh.\n\n\u201cWho is Ambrose?\u201d Nell said.\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cI made him up just now. Sounds like a person who would own a clipboard and exactly seven pens.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s real,\u201d Nell said. \u201cAmbrose Weller. He called. He sounded like he was smiling with his whole face.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, Ambrose is now uncle Ambrose, patron saint of pies.\u201d Ivy drummed on the table. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Mom.\u201d\n\nNell made a face. \u201cMom would\u2014\u201d she started, but the word would was a cliff. Mom would what? She would either laugh or she would say, why are you filling your stomach with things that aren\u2019t good for you and are also not good for somebody\u2019s soul. She would say, I heard on the radio about people who overdo those competitions and then never feel right again. She would say, be careful, honey. That be careful would be full of all the other carefuls. Careful with the streets. Careful with men who want too much. Careful with your hope. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell her after,\u201d Nell decided.\n\nIvy nodded solemnly, then reached across and squeezed Nell\u2019s forearm with cold cucumber fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll make us a lunch for Saturday. We can park the car under the oak tree if we get there early. You can sit on the hood and feel important.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can already feel important standing in my kitchen,\u201d Nell said, and both of them laughed because the kitchen had a hexagon of sunlight on the floor and a plant in the window that was both alive and dead and nothing about it was important to anyone but them.\n\nBetween now and Saturday there were three days that stretched like taffy. That afternoon, Nell tried to run the loop again and gave up, spent from the morning in a way that had nothing to do with muscles. She went to Dovetail instead and stood by the counter, not quite ready to say it out loud to Vera. The clatter of the kitchen was pattering against her ears; someone dropped a spoon with a clang that made her jump. Vera had her sleeves rolled up and flour like snow under her fingernails.\n\n\u201cHardwick,\u201d Vera said without looking up. \u201cYou\u2019re square.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like a person who is thinking in corners,\u201d Vera said. She dusted her hands. \u201cSpit it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to Riverbend,\u201d Nell said. The words tasted like the first cold sip of a drink you make yourself wait for.\n\nVera looked up properly, and there it was\u2014joy like a coin flipped up in sunlight and caught. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Vera said again, but this one sounded like yes. \u201cDo you want to practice or do you want to sit and let your nerves chew on you like a dog on a slipper.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this a trick question?\u201d Nell said, but she had already slipped into the rhythm of the back-and-forth with Vera, the way the older woman would look thoughtfully at a pile of crust as if it were a problem in physics. Today there were peach pies cooling on the racks, the skins slipped off the fruit in long spirals that made the trash can look festive. Vera pointed at the bowl of whipped cream like a conductor with a tiny baton.\n\n\u201cNo cream,\u201d she said. \u201cFinals are no props. You can have water, a towel, and your ridiculous self-discipline.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not ridiculous,\u201d Nell said, and then, because she was being a person who needed to be teased, Vera smirked and said, \u201cIt is, but that\u2019s why we like you.\u201d\n\nVera had once been a dancer, and you can tell because she moves her hands like choreography and because the way she stands always looks like a beginning. When she showed Nell how to angle a plate so that what hits the nose is less shocking, it looked like a step in a routine. When she showed her how to breathe past a hiccup, it looked like symphony.\n\n\u201cDo you think\u2014\u201d Nell started, and stopped.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Vera said, eyes like nails.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke, right? I know it is a joke. The whole thing is a joke. I don\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d She could feel the skin between her eyebrows pinch. \u201cI mean, I want to treat it like a thing and not like\u2014whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a trick you learned at camp to make new friends,\u201d Vera said with a laugh that had mostly empathy in it and only a little sting. \u201cIt\u2019s both. It\u2019s a joke, and it\u2019s a serious one. You\u2019re allowed to care about silly things, Nell. It doesn\u2019t make you silly. It makes you alive.\u201d\n\nNell took that sentence into her mouth and turned it over with her tongue. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Vera said. \u201cThen eat your ridiculous fruit pies and go be a champion at something you can\u2019t put on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Are you going to tell your coach?\u201d\n\nNell looked at the floor. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod save me from righteous athletes,\u201d Vera muttered, but there was no judgment in it. She pushed a plate across to Nell. \u201cHalf pace,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t blow out your cheeks like a cartoon. You\u2019re not a bellows, you\u2019re an animal. Slow. Small. Use your nose.\u201d\n\nNell practiced until her cheeks were sticky and her throat was raw in the way you get from laughing too hard. She practiced until the air smelled more like sugar than she could bear. She went home and slept so hard that the shape of her mouth imprinted the pillowcase. In her dreams she was running through an orchard with pies hanging from the branches like ridiculous apples, and every time she touched one it turned into her coach\u2019s stopwatch and clicked at her, merciless and bright.\n\nThursday night, the contestants\u2019 call was a grid of faces on her cracked laptop, many of them people she had seen only from the side as they bent over plates in Brockton or Dorchester, a few of them newbies. There was a man with a baby on his lap and a woman in a hoodie that said Eat Pray Munch. Ivy watched from the couch, her knees tucked up under her, making faces whenever someone\u2019s audio cut out.\n\n\u201cMute yourselves if you\u2019re not talking,\u201d Ambrose said, looking exactly as Ivy had described him, which was alarming. He had a clipboard and seven pens visible behind his ear in a little crown, and his hair did a thing at the front like it had been styled by accident. \u201cWe have eight contestants. Rules are on page two of your packet. No outside condiments. Hands at sides until the horn. You may drink water. If you throw up\u2014it says in the rules \u2018regurgitate,\u2019 but I\u2019m not afraid of a word\u2014we disqualify. Ten-minute timer. Pies are standard nine-inchers; fillings are apple and blueberry alternated for fairness. Crust is traditional. No pre-slitting the top. And yes,\u201d he said, raising a finger toward a man in a baseball cap who had leaned toward the screen to ask a question, \u201cwe will have napkins. But don\u2019t count on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmbrose,\u201d someone said, \u201ccan we get a list of who\u2019s in.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Ambrose said, and read names like a tiny parade. Big Ray Lafferty, who worked, rumor had it, as a bouncer in Quincy and could lift a keg like it was a kitten. Tina Cole, who did yoga and had a grin that could disarm a whole jury. Julian Pike, who had the kind of narrow face that made him look as though he were perpetually smelling something too sweet. Two newcomers with regular names that Nell promptly forgot because her heart was beating too loud. And then, \u201cLast, we have a late addition, Nell Hardwick of Stoughton\u2014\u201d\n\nIvy squeaked. \u201cShhh,\u201d she said at her own noise, forgetting to be quiet about being quiet.\n\nAmbrose smiled into the camera like he\u2019d heard a secret. \u201cWelcome, Nell. We\u2019re glad to have you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d Nell said, because the square with her own face on it made her skin crawl, so she stopped looking at it and stared at Ambrose\u2019s thumbs instead. They were square thumbs. She wondered if he played an instrument.\n\nRay leaned into the camera, his face filling his square. \u201cHey, Hardwick,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard you\u2019re a runner.\u201d\n\nNell leaned too, in self-defense. Her laptop made a small humming sound like it was trying to be brave. \u201cI heard you\u2019re a bouncer,\u201d she said.\n\nRay chuckled. \u201cOnly on weekends. The rest of the time I teach fifth graders. I tell them not to eat too fast.\u201d He pointed at the camera. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. The first bite is always the worst.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Nell said. Tina gave her a little salute. Julian had arrived late and immediately left his video off, which made his square a gray silhouette like a person in a witness protection scheme. He didn\u2019t speak. A baby somewhere gurgled. Ambrose set his jaw and ran through logistics with the cheerful containment of someone used to herding cats. When the call ended, the apartment felt like a room that had just been evacuated.\n\n\u201cI like Ray,\u201d Ivy said.\n\n\u201cI do too,\u201d Nell said, and surprised herself by adding, unprompted, \u201cJulian is a weasel.\u201d\n\nIvy snorted. \u201cWeasel is a strong word. He\u2019s probably just shy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Nell said, remembering the way his name had dragged across the syllables as if it had burrs attached. \u201cI had a feeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always have feelings,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cThey\u2019re usually wrong. Except about street corners and custard.\u201d She slithered off the couch and onto the floor and did three sit-ups because she had suddenly remembered that her beloved jeans had betrayed her last week. \u201cSo, Saturday: we pack. We bring sunscreen. I make sandwiches.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing heavy,\u201d Nell said, and the words were already rote, and then she saw the face Ivy made\u2014lightly teasing but also drawn, slightly\u2014and said, \u201cNo, I mean\u2014make whatever you want. I\u2019ll eat a little. I just\u2014timing.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Ivy said, rolling her eyes dramatically so that she was not, in fact, looking at Nell at all. \u201cI\u2019m going to prepare an artisanal feast and you can nibble a grape and say, Sister, divine.\u201d\n\n\u201cDivine,\u201d Nell said, putting a hand to her forehead. \u201cSister, divine.\u201d\n\nThey planned, in the haphazard way of sisters who have made a habit out of making plans and then having life laugh at them. Ivy set out the cooler and then put it away because they didn\u2019t own enough ice packs. She made a list on the back of an envelope that already had the word dentist scribbled on it, with the dentist crossed out and replaced with mending and then both crossed out by a doodle of a bird. She was learning how to keep house while sharing a house with someone whose idea of keeping was to put her shoes back in the same place twice in a row. They argued about which blanket to bring and settled on the old plaid one with a hole that had eaten a darker hole out of the middle.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Nell said on Friday morning, when Ivy started to talk about batting practice at the fair. \u201cYou\u2019re getting ahead. You\u2019re trying to give me a future so I don\u2019t have to think about the present.\u201d\n\nIvy stared. \u201cYou are not allowed to say that like you\u2019ve just been to therapy and are teaching your poor sister a lesson.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not allowed,\u201d Nell echoed, and then kissed the top of Ivy\u2019s head with a flourish. \u201cMake me an egg,\u201d she said, and Ivy did, the way she favored it on low heat, the edges frilly and crisp.\n\nFriday afternoon they went to Bird Street Conservation to walk in the green hush, to burn off the nerves in silence. They crossed the little boardwalk that seemed to float over the pond and the insect buzz sounded like a machine turned low. Nell could feel the elastic pull of dread and delight in her stomach, the rope they tied around the post at a kid\u2019s party before the pi\u00f1ata hits. She squeezed Ivy\u2019s hand and then let it go, squeezed and let go, as if she were tempering chocolate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about what comes after,\u201d Ivy said to the trees. \u201cLike, pizza.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and food,\u201d Nell said.\n\n\u201cYou and food,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cYou used to be the kid who counted her corn kernels so she could make sure we both got the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were the kid who would eat mine if I didn\u2019t move fast enough,\u201d Nell said, and they smiled at the water without turning to look at each other. The sun went behind a cloud and came out again like a trick.\n\nPacking for Saturday, they found themselves moving in a clumsy dance around the small apartment. Nell put her lucky socks in the bag and took them out and put them back in. She had not had cause to call them lucky before; they had been simply socks she liked. Now they were artifacts. The bag grew heavier: towel, water bottle, spare tee, hair tie with the metal bit that always snagged a hair and made her swear. Ivy set her phone on the counter and then slid it into the bag and then took it out again because she had a superstition about keeping your phone in your bag\u2014that it made you forget it was there and then you sit on it and shatter your day.\n\nAt ten that night, Ivy pulled a jar of mayonnaise from the cabinet and set it on the counter with a clunk.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nell said without looking up from the packet, which she was reading for the seventeenth time. \u201cAbsolutely not. You know the rules. No condiments. Ambrose would materialize out of the sink and give you a lecture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to bring it,\u201d Ivy said, making an offended face at the jar. \u201cI was going to make potato salad. For me. Because I am a human being who enjoys her life even when her sister has decided to do battle with pastry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a human being who uses too much mayonnaise,\u201d Nell said.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing,\u201d Ivy said, and to demonstrate she unscrewed the lid, dipped a finger into the jar, and tasted it like frosting. She made a face that said, that was a mistake, and then laughed and tapped a dollop onto Nell\u2019s elbow.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Nell said. \u201cGrease me and see if I care.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will care,\u201d Ivy said, wiping it off and flicking the paper towel across the room into the trash can without looking. It landed on the rim and overbalanced the whole thing onto the kitchen floor, where it surrendered in slow motion. They stared at it for a beat, then burst out laughing so hard that the neighbor banged on their wall with a broom handle and someone shouted, \u201cGo to bed,\u201d and then, more quietly, \u201cGood luck tomorrow,\u201d and they pressed their faces into each other\u2019s shoulders to stifle the noise.\n\nSaturday came in quietly, with pale light flattening the edges of everything. Nell woke before the alarm because her muscles did, all of them, a chorus of small throats saying, now? She lay still with her hands on her stomach and breathed in a slow line. The parlor floorboards made the sound of a person remembering a joke in the next room. Ivy\u2019s door was half-open and the bed was a mess. Ivy slept like she was chasing something and she usually caught it.\n\nBreakfast was a banana not yet brown enough and toast the exact shade of gold that made Vera say, approvingly, you can\u2019t teach that. On the way out the door, Ivy swooped back for the blanket and knocked a glass off the coffee table with her hip; the glass was empty and still it made a sound like a catastrophe, but it did not break. They left the apartment in a skitter of apologies to objects and a flurry of pockets checked, thumbs tapping.\n\nThey drove with the windows cracked and the radio playing a song about summer that made Ivy roll her eyes so hard she got a headache. Riverbend Fairgrounds were exactly where the fairgrounds always are: at the edge of things, where the land flattens out as if resigned. The parking lot was a soft cloud of dust that puffed when you walked through it. The smell of fried dough could have been its own city. Children were already sticky, the kind of universal stick that no wipe can fix. A speaker nearby was playing someone\u2019s voice too fast: a man auctioning off jokes. Nell\u2019s stomach did not flip. Nell\u2019s stomach stood at attention and saluted.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find Ambrose,\u201d Ivy said, because she had developed affection for her invented uncle. \u201cHe will guide us. He will lay a hand on a hay bale and the hay bale will become a podium. He will lead us to the tent of triumph.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease keep your imagination inside your ribs,\u201d Nell said, but she was smiling, which made her words friendly and not cruel. She found the sign-in table easily. There was a banner overhead with a pie slice as a logo and the words Commonwealth Pie-Off written in a font that tried to look like someone had done it with a fountain pen. Ambrose was there, of course. He and his seven pens. One of them was already out of ink.\n\n\u201cNell!\u201d he said, the kind of greeting that places your name right in the middle of his day on purpose. He gave her a badge that said FINALIST in a font that did not try to look expensive. He handed a second badge to Ivy. VOLUNTEER, it said, and Ivy held it up to her chest like a corsage.\n\n\u201cOh wow,\u201d Ivy whispered, but into the day, not into any ear in particular. \u201cLook at the goats. They\u2019re already planning. Look at that one. His eyes\u2014criminal.\u201d\n\nNell tuned out the goats and the laughter caught in the tent behind them. She heard Ray\u2019s laugh and turned toward it like a plant leaning into sun. He was at the edge of the staging area, talking to a little boy about worms. \u201cDo they breathe?\u201d the boy was saying, and Ray was answering with more seriousness than most teachers give to the end of the year.\n\nTina waved. Julian drifted in, late as on the call, with a woman trailing him who had that pinched look of someone who never quite gets what she wants and has decided to tell everyone about it later. Julian saw Nell and didn\u2019t disguise the way his eyes moved from her shoes to her face like a scanner.\n\n\u201cHardwick,\u201d he said, blandly. \u201cHeard you came up from fourth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it works,\u201d Nell said. \u201cWhen someone drops, someone else picks up.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot lucky,\u201d he said, and there was something in the way he trimmed the word down, shaved it to its bone.\n\nNell made a quiet \u201chm\u201d noise at him because she is a person who will say more than she intends to if she replies. He smiled, quick and transient, like something you see in a car window and aren\u2019t sure you saw at all.\n\nAmbrose clapped his hands for attention. \u201cHalf hour. Warm-ups,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t like a team gather; it was more like herding ducks. Someone yelled something about corndogs. The air under the tent had warmed by ten degrees by the time they had all shuffled in to see their places. The tables were long and the pies under their domes looked innocent in a way that made Nell jealous of them. The crowd would be ready to watch their innocence be eaten.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll meet you back here,\u201d Ivy said brightly, tapping the cooler. \u201cI put your lunch in this like it\u2019s a prize. Eat a little. Something with salt, something with calm.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Nell said, but neither of them believed it. They believed more in signs. In the way the rope lay coiled by the tent post, in the number of blue balloons and the exact angle of the sun. They believed in each other. Ivy kissed Nell\u2019s cheek with a smack and then looked, briefly, serious.\n\n\u201cWhatever happens,\u201d she said softly, not quite a whisper because they did not whisper important things, \u201cwe\u2019ll get out of here and go sit on our blanket and make fun of tiny goats.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever happens,\u201d Nell said, and the words went into the skin between them and lodged there like pins that never pricked. She turned and walked toward the stage and felt the entire world tilt a fraction, not visible to anyone else but making her adjust her feet so she didn\u2019t stumble.\n\nBehind the tent, the contestant table was set with paper name cards that someone had doodled flowers on because someone had been bored. Nell\u2019s had a little runner drawn in the corner, which made her laugh. Beside it, a bottle of water sweated itself a ring. She moved in her small square, tested the table edge, shook out her arms lightly. Ray did a little dance. Tina closed her eyes and breathed. Julian was nowhere; then he was there, and then he was gone again, slippery, like his name.\n\nThe time compressed. Ambrose raised a hand. The crowd leaned. Somewhere, the goats made their planning noises. Nell looked once toward the open field where Ivy would lay a blanket in the sun, where a basket would sit full of sandwiches, where in an hour or two they would sit side by side and Nell would say, do you feel that, like a door opened and then closed, like something left and then something else came. She looked once, because you have to have somewhere to look when the noise starts. The volunteers moved like a school. Ray rolled his shoulders and grinned across the table at her and whispered, \u201cFirst bite,\u201d and she nodded and tucked her hair behind her ear like that was going to accomplish anything.\n\nThere are things you decide in the moment before. Who you are, for one. Or who you will be for ten minutes. Nell decided, again, that she would be funny later and serious now, or perhaps exactly the other way around. She rolled her wrists. She set her mouth. And then a woman with a hat shaped like a rooster signaled the opening gong by hitting a pan with a wooden spoon so hard that it went clang and the sound went up like birds, and everyone leaned forward, their faces a caricature of forwardness, and the first pie came toward her like a blessing and a dare.",

                              "content": "The first bite was always the worst because it was a betrayal. Your mouth thought it knew what was coming\u2014sweet and crust and the soft give of fruit\u2014and then there was the blunt reality of flour that hadn\u2019t known a breath of air since dawn and sugar that tried to stick to your tongue like a child who does not want to be put down. Nell let it happen. She let the shock take her, the way you let a wave slap you once so you know how hard to brace for the next. The crust top lifted under her teeth with a sound only she heard, a dry whisper. She cut a neat wedge with her mouth, two chews, a third because her mother\u2019s voice from some kitchen years ago insisted on a third, and then she took a slip of water and moved it down. Ray\u2019s \u201cFirst bite!\u201d came like a charm from somewhere to her left. The crowd made a sound like wind pushing through a field. A volunteer with a sash that said STATE PIE-SON laughed for no reason that had anything to do with her, which felt like blessing.\n\nShe found the rhythm like she always did, not in numbers but in landmarks that had nothing to do with the table in front of her. Corner seam, inhale, cut line, quick press of tongue, swallow. Crust edge, jaw soft not hard, breath out through nose because Vera had said, in a tone you only use with dogs and dancers, don\u2019t waste air. She anchored to the feeling of her feet inside her shoes, the way her sock bunched slightly under her right big toe because laundry had been lazy this week. The pie was apple, tart and smart, not a sloppy one. She loved Vera for a second, irrationally, and then remembered Vera had not made this and loved whoever did with equal irrationality.\n\nJulian\u2019s plate clashed with something metal and he swore, softly, a sibilant sound he tried to fold into the noise. He was fast, but fast in a way that prided itself on violence; he went at the top crust like it had insulted him. Tina flared her nostrils like a mare and settled into a steady tempo that would make any coach weep in gratitude. Ray made a face at a baby in the front row between bites, an exaggerated cross-eyed thing that the baby rewarded with a shriek of joy that could have counted as a weapon if anyone had been keeping a different kind of score. Ambrose moved along the back like a general who never learned to march; he was all bounce and wrists, tapping the stopwatch with his thumb as if reassurance could be transmitted through plastic. He had exactly seven pens in his pocket and one in his mouth, chewed as if it were licorice.\n\nThe second pie was blueberry and it made her feel like a person being forgiven. The juice glossed her teeth and followed the spoon of her tongue down into the place where things wait to become you. She adjusted. Smaller bites now, because the blue wanted to run, and if it ran onto her wrist she would have to ignore it and she did not trust herself to. She tasted summer and a small thread of salt that must have been someone\u2019s sweat because the tent was a ten degrees hotter than God intended, and she did not stop. She listened for Ivy without looking for Ivy, because seeing her would be both perfect and a wrecking ball. She caught only the outline of her laugh, thrown like a rope across the back of the tent. Somewhere a goat bleated like a door hinge with an opinion. The woman with the rooster hat banged the pan again for some other event and Ambrose waved at her with a look that said, politely, later.\n\nAt two minutes in, her body suggested\u2014kindly, but firmly\u2014that she was making a mistake. It wasn\u2019t a cramp. It wasn\u2019t even pain. It was a pressure that announced itself under her breastbone, a careful administrator knocking on the office door in the middle of class with a memo: The stomach is full enough. Please take corrective action. She negotiated. She was fluent in this language, the bargaining the body does when it thinks it is in charge. Okay, she said to herself, okay, but we\u2019ve trained, and also, be quiet. She shortened the chew to almost nothing, counted breaths instead of swallows, and let the water do some of the work that would have been forbidden in the pool but was acceptable here. Ray coughed and covered it with a smile, then gave the tiniest nod in Nell\u2019s direction like they were colleagues in a bad play who had decided to save each other.\n\nJulian edged his plate an inch closer to Nell\u2019s space as if the surface area of table pledged allegiance to him. She did not flinch; flinching would concede something. She made her world the diameter of the pie tin and the circle of her mouth. He made a sound\u2014not a gag, not anything that would catch a judge, just an aggressive throat clear\u2014that sent one person in the crowd into a reflexive chorus of \u201cYuck\u201d and another into laughter. Ambrose glanced that way without stopping his walk. He had a hummingbird\u2019s attention span and a hawk\u2019s eyes. Tina shifted her hips, found calm again, and murmured something that might have been prayer or cursing. Nell swallowed and gave her stomach a compliment for still working. She told it it was pretty, because sometimes the body is vain and will do what you need if you flatter it.\n\n\u201cFive,\u201d Ambrose called, and because he had not specified seconds or minutes, the word rushed over the tent like weather. A kid somewhere started to chant what he thought was helpful and what was not: \u201cEat! Eat! Eat!\u201d The cadence was wrong. Nell made her own, quiet and internal. Cut, curve, wet, nose. She felt a hiccup bloom in her diaphragm, treacherous and hiccups always felt like they had been mailed to her by enemies. She did the thing Vera had shown her, pressing the heels of her hands lightly against the bottom of her ribcage, exhaling into the space without giving away air she could not spare. It worked. She thought of the elm that dropped seed pods on her like a kindness because her brain needed a tree right now. The world shrank to a table and expanded to include the first mile marker on her favorite route, a bend where the asphalt had a scorch mark from some accident that had happened when she was a child and was never washed away. The memory was so crisp it made her teeth ache as if it had touched them.\n\nOn some level under the part of her that did this absurd thing with competence, she knew she was being watched. Not the friendly kind. There was a gaze like a cold hand at the back of her neck from somewhere beyond the first row of spectators, beyond the children with sticky hands and behind the tall man in the Bruins shirt holding two lemonades as if they were trophies. It wasn\u2019t Coach Marta; Coach Marta would have been scowling so hard the tent would have collapsed. It wasn\u2019t her mother. She wasn\u2019t sure who it was until she saw, in the glint of a spoon, the quick reflection of someone standing with arms crossed as if to hold in a thousand opinions. Vera. Of course she had come. Dovetail had set out a short rack of hand pies at the fair and sent Vera with a square tin to sell them as an experiment in advertising. A flour smudge on her throat made her look like she\u2019d been kissed by a ghost. Nell\u2019s throat tightened for a different reason and she had to school her face back into neutral because smiling would do nothing but trap sugar in the corners of her mouth and make her look pyrrhic.\n\nThe third pie was apple again and drier. The baker had been frugal, or had been spooked by the way fruit changes its mind when it meets heat. The crust was beautiful to look at and false on the tongue, like a dress you buy because of the hanger and then hate when you put it on. Nell adjusted. She took a sip of water every three bites whether her body asked or not, because compliance does not always make you a winner but it makes you finished. Julian lifted his plate to tilt the pie like a burger. It was a small cheat and not illegal and meant only that the syrup would go places syrup did not belong, but he liked the drama of it. A blueberry slid toward the table and he caught it with the back of his knuckles and flicked it into his mouth with a flourish so small most people would have missed it, but Nell saw because the unfair always glowed for her even when it was tiny and stupid. She felt the ghost of what anger would be later and let it ride by like a loud motorcycle on a road she no longer lived on.\n\nAmbrose\u2019s hand shot up at seven and then down again. He must have had some deal with the rooster-hat woman because she did not hit the pan, and Nell loved him for that with an intensity she would forget his name deserved after this. A bead of sweat found the ridge at her temple and paused there. She did not wipe it away. She would not do a single thing with the hand that did not serve this minute. Ivy made a sound, or maybe the sound was just what her brain supplied when it needed Ivy, and Nell took the smallest breath that had ever counted as a breath and kept going. When she had trained for the mile, Marta had said, there\u2019s a point where you leave the person who walked in and you wait. If you wait long enough the person who can do this shows up. She waited. She crossed the little invisible threshold and the stupid crown she wanted\u2014the one without jewels that would live in a cardboard box under a bed\u2014rose like a piece of toast in her head.\n\nThere was always a moment in any race where you felt an apology forming like weather. I am sorry, you thought at your knees, at your lungs, at the muscle inside your left thigh that never trusted you again after the injury in February. I am sorry for asking. She felt it now. She felt the apology and then the counterargument that she had learned to bring: You wanted this. You signed your own name. She chewed. She swallowed. She tried and failed not to think about what this would do to her night run tomorrow, whether she would feel like a bag of flour strapped to a bad idea. She imagined the goats escaping in a small, dignified parade, tiny horns like punctuation marks.\n\nAt nine, the tent sounded different. It was not quieter, but the noise had turned a corner into something that pulled at the edge of your clothing. The crowd wanted a finish the way a crowd always does: not because they wished you harm, but because they needed the relief of completion so they could get another lemonade. Ambrose\u2019s thumb hovered over the stopwatch button like a blessing and then retreated because he wasn\u2019t a god, even with his pens. Ray\u2019s grin had become something that looked almost like a grimace, and then he saw Nell see it and turned it into a grin again because he was that kind of person even when no fifth graders were present. Tina was steady as laundry. Julian had a halo of crumbs on his cheeks like a biblical painting done on a bad day. He was still fast. He was also sweating and his sweat smelled like cinnamon and nerves.\n\nThe hiccup tried her again at nine-forty. It grabbed her diaphragm with a little hook and said, cruelly casual, remember me. She pressed her tongue flat to the roof of her mouth and let her breath fall low. She thought of Ivy\u2019s forehead when she slept, the small crease that meant she was dreaming fast. She thought of Vera\u2019s nail beds dusted white. She thought of a bench on Central where the gum left by teenagers in winter had made a fossil. She did not hiccup. She swallowed the bite that had threatened to be a catastrophe and the swallow went down with the relief of a train that hits the track after skidding in snow.\n\n\u201cTime!\u201d Ambrose yelled, and the word came with a clatter of something Nell could not see. The horn misbehaved and made a sound like a goose dying, but he had the watch raised in his hand and that was the gospel. Plates went down in a dozen claps. Bodies lifted back like puppets whose strings had slackened. Nell put her hands on the edge of the table and pressed, not because she needed to but because she needed to feel a surface that was not expectant. Her mouth tasted like metal and fruit and the idea of being fourteen. The audience made the noise an audience makes when they have watched someone do something they did not want to do themselves, a combination of admiration and faint disgust and gratitude.\n\nAmbrose and the judges moved along the line, calling numbers that barely made sense until they started to make too much sense. Slices counted, fractions of slices eyed with a severity that would have embarrassed people in any other context. \u201cNine and two-thirds,\u201d someone said near Tina, awed. \u201cEight,\u201d someone said near the newcomer with a small tattoo of a spoon on her wrist. Ambrose reached Ray and Ray shrugged as if to say, whatever happens, I have worms and fifth graders and a life. \u201cTen,\u201d Ambrose said, pleased. He got to Julian and paused because something was off but not obvious and then leaned in close. Julian leaned back with the posture of a person who believes leaning can save him. \u201cNine and a half,\u201d Ambrose said eventually, and Julian smiled with half his mouth because that way it looked like he hadn\u2019t planned to smile at all.\n\nWhen they came to Nell, she had to look away from her own plate because she knew, roughly, what she had done, but knowing it in public would make it real in a way she wasn\u2019t ready for. \u201cNine,\u201d Ambrose said, and then, after a beat and a tilt of his head that suggested he could make a living measuring small things with his eyes, \u201cand a quarter.\u201d He smiled then, a full one, none of this half-mouth nonsense, and gave the edge of her plate the tiniest tap with his knuckle like a secret handshake. Nell laughed because the only other option was to sob, and she did not have time for that today. Ivy\u2019s cheer came like a thrown coat from the edge of the staging area, bright and out of step with whatever the rest of the crowd was doing. Tina reached over and squeezed Nell\u2019s forearm as if they were already on the same team. Ray banged his hand on the table once and winced because the table was not designed for such affection.\n\nThey gave Ray first, Tina third, and Nell second, which felt, in the body, like being told you got into the college you had convinced yourself you didn\u2019t want because you couldn\u2019t afford it. Her name sounded different through the microphone when Ambrose said it, and she had a split-second to imagine what would happen if she just lay down under the tablecloth and took a nap under there and came out next year. She stood instead. She stood and let someone hang a ribbon around her neck that would make sense to exactly thirty people in her life. She shook Ray\u2019s hand and he leaned in to say, \u201cYou scared me a little,\u201d as if that were the highest compliment he could think to pay. She shook Tina\u2019s and Tina said, with her soft deadpan, \u201cYou made apple look kind,\u201d which meant actually nothing and meant everything, and they both knew it.\n\nJulian clapped at the requisite volume and not a decibel more, his palms slapping his rings. His runner\u2019s build made his clapping look sarcastic. The woman who had come with him, the one with the pinched mouth, looked Nell up and down like a person buying meat not convinced of its freshness. There was a half-second where Nell thought she saw, on the edge of Julian\u2019s lips, the brief quiver that meant something wanted out. Ambrose saw it too, and his gaze sharpened. The quiver went away. Sometime between the first place ribbon and the third, Julian disappeared, leaving behind a napkin on which someone had written a phone number that had been crossed out and replaced with a different one. Ambrose picked up the napkin as if it might explode, folded it neatly into a square, and slid it into his pocket with the pens.\n\nAfter the little photos and the larger photos and the joke someone made about pie face that made four people groan and one person laugh only because they wanted to be part of something, Nell found herself off the stage with the ribbon burning a gentle mark into the skin above her collarbone. Ivy nearly knocked her over, as if she had decided that tackle hugs were a language the world needed. The ribbon cut her chin in the press of it and they stepped back and laughed at their own clumsiness, both of them sweaty and bright-eyed like thieves who had gotten away with the hat and the money and the chandelier.\n\n\u201cYou were so disgusting,\u201d Ivy said with love.\n\n\u201cYou were so loud,\u201d Nell said with equal love.\n\n\u201cI held water like I was a queen,\u201d Ivy said, brandishing the empty bottle like a scepter. \u201cAlso, I learned how to say regurgitate in two languages.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you did,\u201d Nell said. The goats bleated in a chord that sounded like the end of something. Vera slid in from the right with the same stealth she must have used to slip into auditions once upon a time. She smelled faintly of vanilla and the cleaner they used at Dovetail that smelled like lemons only if you had never met one. She looked at Nell with her head tipped, like a person admiring a painting she had had no hand in but had approved on principle.\n\n\u201cYou were pretty,\u201d Vera said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean literally, though that too. I mean\u2014you did a pretty thing. That\u2019s the whole point. Congratulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Nell said, and because she wanted Vera to know what she had thought at the table, she said, \u201cThank you for making me ridiculous,\u201d and Vera smiled with embarrassment because compliments make her itchy.\n\nAmbrose hovered until hovering became awkward and then made it charming by announcing it. \u201cI am hovering,\u201d he said. \u201cI am trying to congratulate you without making it about my clipboard, which frankly does deserve some attention. You did well, Ms. Hardwick.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Nell said, again, because the word had not become insincere yet and she didn\u2019t think it would if she said it in the right tone. \u201cAnd the pens look nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d he said, deadpan, tapping the pocket. \u201cSomeone who notices. There\u2019s a supper after. It\u2019s ham and three salads no one eats. You are free to avoid it. But\u2014I wanted to say\u2014there\u2019s a showcase in August. It\u2019s smaller, more\u2026televised, which is a word I am uneasy using as if my life includes television. They ask a few finalists from around the region. It pays, which I am legally allowed to tell you, and there is less dust, which I am spiritually allowed to promise. If you\u2019re interested, I\u2019ll send your name and you can pretend you tripped and fell into it.\u201d\n\nNell felt the scalp-prickle of opportunity the way some people feel weather change in their knees. It was not what she had expected anyone to say to her today. She had thought maybe somebody would say, how do you breathe, and she would say, through my nose, like a goddamn secret, and then they would go home. She looked at Ivy, whose eyebrows had shot up as if Ambrose had just proposed to both of them. She looked at Vera, who made a face that in her subtle vocabulary meant, careful, not no, not yes, but careful, which was the same word they prayed now. She looked down at the ribbon and thought of Coach Marta\u2019s stopwatch and the way a beep can slice a day into before and after.\n\n\u201cSend it,\u201d she said, because even if this wasn\u2019t a life it was a thing that felt like one, and she wanted to see who she was when she stepped toward it. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014think. A lot. Too much. But send it.\u201d\n\nAmbrose nodded with relief out of proportion to the size of the ask. \u201cI will feel professional for at least nine minutes today because of this,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you.\u201d He shook her hand like she was a baker who had provided the right change without looking. \u201cAnd enjoy your goats.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Ivy said solemnly on their behalf.\n\nThey found the blanket under the oak tree because Ivy had the homing mechanism of a person who hoards comfort. The shade was a relief that made Nell\u2019s skin feel like a thing you could take off. Ivy set down the basket with theatrical pride and revealed her treasures: two sandwiches, one with cucumber and chive spread that made Vera\u2019s approval voice in Nell\u2019s head say okay, and one with roast chicken and too much mayonnaise because Ivy would never be deterred by an admonition. There were cherries with stems that curled like cursive, and a bag of salt-and-vinegar chips that had exploded on the drive into a puff of crumbs that had nevertheless kept their menace. There was lemonade in a mason jar because Ivy liked the way the glass made the sun look expensive. They ate slow, which was the only speed anyone wanted now.\n\n\u201cYour mouth is blue,\u201d Ivy said, satisfied.\n\n\u201cYou have a ribbon hickey,\u201d Nell said, pointing at her own clavicle to show the stain in return.\n\nThey lay back and watched the sky through the leaves. The fair moved around them like a friendly animal. A girl with her face painted like a tiger ran past, roaring in a way that would have been more convincing if she hadn\u2019t been clutching a candy apple like a teddy bear. A man tried to sell them kettle corn by offering them a free handful and they declined out of a decency that felt saintly. Ray wandered over with his fifth graders in tow\u2014apparently three of them had found him here, which seemed to be a thing that happened when you were that kind of man\u2014and waved without approaching because the oak tree shade looked sacred. Tina ran by without stopping, her hoodie tied around her waist, whooping at a toddler she clearly did not know and making the toddler whoop back, because some people conduct a band wherever they go and do not know they are doing it.\n\nVera sat on the corner of the blanket only after asking the blanket permission with her eyes. She handed Nell a napkin with a corner folded not quite perfectly. \u201cI am going to say something that will irritate you,\u201d she announced, which was the only way to say a thing like that without losing a friend. \u201cCall your coach. If she sees this on the internet before she hears it from you, she will turn into a saint of disapproval and haunt you until the next century. Better to choose your haunting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Nell said, because you can be brave with a lemonade in one hand and somebody\u2019s thumb on your ankle in a way that says I am here, which was what Ivy\u2019s thumb was doing. She rolled onto her side and fished her phone out of the bag. It was a rectangle of dread. She put it on her chest like a heavy book and stared at the oak canopy while she gathered the courage to pick it up.\n\nAs if the phone could smell it, it buzzed in that exact gut-dropping way a split-second before her thumb touched the screen. Her chest went tight and her mouth dried, which was absurd given the gallons she had just poured into it. The name on the screen was not Marta, which would have been a relief and would not have been a relief. It was her mother. If you could have photographed the moment her face recognized the letters, it would have won some competition for honesty. Ivy saw and made a sound like, oh. Vera pretended not to see so hard that it counted as kindness.\n\nShe answered. \u201cHi,\u201d she said, and every person she had ever been was in the one syllable.\n\n\u201cHi, honey,\u201d her mother said, and her voice was exactly as tired as it had been since the day Dad left and did not return even for his favorite cufflinks. There was an edge there that might have been the car, might have been a hallway, might have been a thought she hadn\u2019t told anyone yet. \u201cSomeone sent me a video. Mrs. Dalrymple, of course. Oh, Nell.\u201d She was the only person who could make the word oh sound like a laugh and a sigh and a weather report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014not what it looks like,\u201d Nell said, and then laughed at herself because it was exactly what it looked like. \u201cIt\u2019s a little what it looks like. It\u2019s the finals, Mom. I got second.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond,\u201d her mother said, as if the word had been carved out of a harder word. \u201cWell. Are you all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Nell said. Ivy was making faces at her, supportive faces, faces that said you are okay into the air so it would carry. \u201cIt was\u2014fun. And awful. Like cross-country but in your mouth. I didn\u2019t tell you because I\u2014\u201d She looked at Vera, whose mouth was a firm line in the shape of encouragement. She looked at Ivy, who mimed the act of zipping her lips and then unzipping them, which was unhelpful and perfect. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the be careful to make me feel like I was doing a wrong thing. I wanted it to feel like\u2014I was choosing it.\u201d\n\nOn the other end there was that small sound her mother made when she adjusted her glasses and tried to find language that didn\u2019t live in the first drawer. \u201cYou two girls,\u201d she said, and the girls had never left her mouth even when death and debt had tried to take everything else. \u201cDo you remember that you used to do that thing where you\u2019d race spoons? In the sink? And I\u2019d come in and you\u2019d be cheering for a spoon like it was going to go to college.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe still do that,\u201d Ivy said loudly, leaning toward the phone like it would drink her. \u201cThe spoons got scholarships.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hush,\u201d Mom said, but there was a smile in it. \u201cNell, be careful with your\u2014you know. Your breath. I don\u2019t know. Be careful with the part of you that always thinks one win is an answer. You get to do silly things if you want. You also get to protect your\u2014your knees, and your\u2014oh, I sound like an old woman with a bag of weather. I am proud of you in a way that includes worry. That\u2019s the only way I know how to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Nell said. The oak leaves made a sound like a skirt on a church floor. Somewhere a chicken complained. \u201cI\u2019ll come by after. You can tell me what you would do if you got second in a pie-eating contest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would frame the ribbon and then never talk about it again,\u201d her mother said instantly, which made all three of them laugh. \u201cOkay. I love you. I\u2019ll heat stew. It can be lunch or dinner or both.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d Nell said. When she hung up, she pressed the phone to her sternum the way you might press a photograph there and she allowed herself exactly twenty seconds of lying still and doing nothing and feeling like she had tugged a thread that led somewhere she couldn\u2019t see.\n\nThey were on their second round of cherries when he appeared. Julian, without his shadow woman, without his napkin of numbers, knocked the bottom of his foot against the edge of the oak\u2019s root as if it had offended him and then stood there with his hands in his pockets, looking at them without asking to be looked at. He had his sunglasses on the crown of his head where they could keep no one from being seen. He had the smile of someone who had crafted a sentence in his car and now wanted to let it out.\n\n\u201cThat was lucky,\u201d he said, and he might have meant it conversationally but the way his mouth turned the k made it a knife.\n\nNell sat up. She had the desire to say something mean, which she rarely indulged because it never felt as good as it promised. Ivy widened her eyes and then narrowed them in the universal sister semaphore for do not, or perhaps do, depending. Vera did not move at all, which was a move.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always luck,\u201d Nell said, because this was true and not true and the truth inside it made it honest enough to count. \u201cWe all show up with the same mouth. The rest is weather.\u201d\n\nJulian\u2019s smile twitched. The skin around his eyes tightened the way someone\u2019s does when they have learned not to show disappointment for an audience and then forget there are people who know where to look. He glanced at Vera as if she might be a judge even now, then back at Nell. \u201cThere\u2019s a televised thing,\u201d he said, as if he were dispensing a secret for a price. \u201cYou should say no.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of advice for someone I just met,\u201d Nell said. \u201cDo you say yes or no to things? Are you the kind of person who says yes to everything and then calls them accidents, or the kind who says no and then lives angry.\u201d\n\nHe stared for a second because he had expected her to be soft. Then he shrugged, which was not a shrug, and turned. \u201cSee you around,\u201d he said, which had in it the threat and the promise of every small town\u2019s limited options. He walked away with his shoulders set, and whatever he would say about her later had already written itself on his face.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely a weasel,\u201d Ivy whispered, the moment he was out of earshot.\n\n\u201cWeasels are useful,\u201d Vera said, out of her past life as a person who knew the names of animals in books. \u201cThey keep down certain other populations. We are grateful for them even when they get into the kitchen.\u201d\n\nNell laughed and lay back down and thought about August. The sky above the oak was the kind of blue you could fall into and not be returned. The ribbon on her chest itched and she let it. She closed her eyes and saw the pies rolling toward her like little planets. She closed them again and saw a stopwatch turn into something else entirely, a coin maybe, or a bell. She closed them once more and saw herself running where the sidewalks were cracked, counting her weird litany: mailbox, stop sign, elm, bench, memorial, pothole, pie. She had a new word for the list now, which felt like the feeling you get when a friend teaches you the name of a flower you\u2019ve been seeing your whole life. She tasted sugar again and winced and smiled around the wince.\n\nThey stayed until the shadows lengthened and the children\u2019s tears began because staying past nap time makes all love tragic. They packed the blanket with the uncoordinated grace of two people deciding not to talk about what they were thinking because saying it would make it too true. They walked back across the dust and the goats judged them with their cold, rectangular eyes, which made Ivy cackle. Ray called, \u201cSee you at some ridiculous afternoon,\u201d and they waved, flapping their fingers in a manner that said yes to an invitation neither of them had yet received. Ambrose tilted his clipboard in farewell like an old-fashioned man tipping a hat. Vera squeezed Nell\u2019s shoulder with the part of her hand that is soft and said nothing, which was the only blessing Nell could have stood in that moment.\n\nIn the car, the seatbelts made their small mechanical coughs. The radio tried on another summer song and Ivy ordered it to behave and it did not. The ribbon lay in Nell\u2019s lap, a strip of fabric with a cheap pin and a history that felt heavy for its cost. Ivy drove with one hand and ate a chip with the other, a skill that would one day earn her a ticket and a lecture, but not today. The road out of Riverbend had a dip that made your stomach rise in a way that was fun if you were steady and catastrophic if you were on the edge of anything. They hit it and laughed because their bodies did not disagree. The day unspooled toward evening like a spool that did not know its thread was about to tangle, and Nell rested her head on the window and let the cool of it press a mark into her temple that would be shaped like a circle for an hour and like memory for longer.",

The Hardwick house, with its reluctant porch and the lilac that had taken over the second step as if it had bought the deed, looked like it always did: a little too proud for its bones and therefore familiar. Ivy parallel parked with the cinematic flourish of someone who believes every three-point turn is a scene, and they sat in the cooled-down car for a second because honor demanded they prolong the savoring. The stew smell met them halfway down the walk, heavy and forgiving. Someone on the block was playing the kind of music that lives in speakers like it was born there, and a dog across the street threw its opinion at a squirrel and missed, again, which was the dog\u2019s whole story.\n\nMom had set the good bowls out as if a ribbon demanded crockery. She stood with her hand on the back of a chair and looked them over as if she were accepting delivery of a painting. The ribbon lay on the table, flat and defenseless. She looked at it and then at Nell\u2019s face and then at the ribbon again, a path worn already.\n\n\u201cYou look outraged,\u201d Ivy said, kissing air on either side of her mother\u2019s cheek because actual kisses sometimes made both of them shy.\n\n\u201cI am arranging my feelings,\u201d their mother said. She took off her glasses and cleaned them on the corner of her cardigan in a motion that had comforted babies. \u201cThe arrangement will include pride. And soup. Sit.\u201d\n\nThey sat. The stew was beef that had been cow twice and then generosity, with potatoes that had surrendered and carrots that had refused, and it tasted like the kind of decision you make when you\u2019re not sure what the week will bring. Mom watched them eat but not too closely, a trick she had learned when they were small and had decided to insist on autonomy before they could spell it. She had lit a candle for no reason but smell, which was her new way of praying. The ribbon lay between the salt and the little dish of shredded cheese, a piece of plastic with weight attached by the three of them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be the mother of a person who eats pies as a sport,\u201d Mom said after the first few bites, which were always the most honest. \u201cI thought I had finished with\u2026adjusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like you\u2019re eighty,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cYou made a new email address last year and everything. You are modern. You are being modern about stew.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am being modern about stew,\u201d Mom said, which made her laugh at herself and then pretend to be irritated that her children had made her laugh. She turned to Nell. \u201cAre you going to keep doing it?\u201d\n\nNell put her spoon down and looked at the window because the window was not judging her; the window had seen them all cry and liked them anyway. The candle made the kitchen smell like two things at once and the confusion was bizarrely calming. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. It came out in the voice she used for presents she didn\u2019t understand yet. \u201cAmbrose said there\u2019s a showcase in August. Televised. I don\u2019t know what that means. If it\u2019s\u2026you know. Real.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be real because you will be in it,\u201d Mom said, and then made a face at her own earnestness because she had been friends with her own suspicion for decades. \u201cYou will tell your coach.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell my coach,\u201d Nell said, and the words sat in the room like a guest they would all accommodate. She pictured Marta\u2019s jaw and the way it settled when she had decided a person needed to be told something that might break them a little. She pictured the stopwatch face, impersonal and bright. She pictured a version of herself being reasonable and another version suing for joy. She picked up her spoon and let the stew\u2019s salt tell her all the unromantic truths that also count.\n\nThey ate like people who had already done a thing and would do other things later. After, Ivy and Mom washed up in the clack-and-glow of their familiar choreography, and Nell wandered to the refrigerator to stare at magnets as if they could answer. There was a calendar with dates circled that had acquired new meanings since Dad left, a list of library hours that were never useful when you needed them, a photo of Nell at eight holding a frog with both hands and making a face that looked like both of her parents at once. Her phone lay face down on the table, heavy with intent. She flipped it and there it was: Ambrose\u2019s email, subject line wearing its hat too formally. Also a message thread from the team, a flood of faces and names and the code language you only learn when you have run up a hill next to someone during a rainstorm and said three sentences you will never admit you said.\n\nJess had sent the video, of course. Jess, who ran the group text like she had been born in a phone. There were hearts and flaming emojis and a skull, because someone thought they were funny. Someone had written, you are going to puke in Providence and it is going to be art. Coach Marta had not weighed in. The absence was an outline of her shape. Nell felt the prickling relief of not being ambushed by Marta in front of everyone, and also the dread of knowing that ambush had just been rescheduled for a more private room.\n\nShe took her phone into her mother\u2019s back hall, into the narrow space where winter coats went to be forgotten and where once, in a tantrum she didn\u2019t remember except in the bones, she had kicked a scuff into the baseboard and then cried at the mark. She pressed call and listened to the ringing like a metronome that tried to keep her honest.\n\nMarta answered on the third ring with her signature greeting, which was to somehow make your name into an assessment. \u201cNell.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoach,\u201d Nell said, and every tendon in her body arranged itself in allegiance. \u201cI wanted to, um\u2014say it before you saw it. Someone probably sent it already. I went to Riverbend. For the\u2014Pie-Off finals. I got second.\u201d\n\nThere was a silence that did not pretend it was thinking. When Marta spoke, her voice was so even it felt like the flat part of a road after a bad hill. \u201cI saw. Congratulations.\u201d\n\nThe word did not splinter, but it had a hinge in it, and on the other side there was a weight. Nell found the door frame with her knuckles because she needed wood. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, like a person insisting their nouns do the job they were hired to do.\n\n\u201cWhat is it for you,\u201d Marta said, not in the way of a person asking about prize money, which would never interest her, but in the way of a person testing the quality of a string. \u201cIs it fun. Is it\u2014compulsion. Is it a way to take your competence for a walk because you are otherwise caged.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d Nell said, and stopped because she wanted to answer well and also because the truth wouldn\u2019t wait for her to syllable it into elegance. \u201cIt was supposed to be a joke. It\u2019s not a joke, exactly. It\u2019s not a plan either. It feels like a room I didn\u2019t know was in my house and now I keep opening the door just to see how the light is.\u201d\n\nMarta laughed, truly, and the sound rearranged the hall for a second. \u201cYou think in houses. That makes sense. I don\u2019t despise you for trying a new door. Here is the issue, and you already know the nouns. Training. Recovery. Gastrointestinal whatever. Also the narrative in your head. If you start needing the adrenaline of a crowd for silly things, you might need it for the serious ones later and it will not be there and you will feel betrayed by your own chemistry. We are a month from Providence. I have watched you turn one promise into a performance for years. You are allowed to do stupid things as long as you are as advanced at being careful as you are at being stubborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do both,\u201d Nell said, probably too fast, because her mouth had learned to get her ahead of her thoughts when the gun went.\n\n\u201cYou can,\u201d Marta said, but there was a question cracked into the center of it like an egg. \u201cHere are the terms, since terms help some people feel safe. No more competitions until Providence. If you want to go on this television in August, you and I will sit down with Vera and a nutritionist I trust and you will allow me to be boring in your vicinity while I plan the stupid alongside the serious so they do not murder each other. If in the next four weeks I catch you training your swallow instead of your stride, I will bench you with the kind of sorrow you cannot talk your way out of. Do you understand me.\u201d\n\nNell leaned her head against the coat with the broken zipper, which smelled like winter and the time Dad wore it to sleep on the couch because he had decided to be noble about something he had not warned anyone about. \u201cI do,\u201d she said. She meant it. She also reserved, in some quiet corner of herself, the right to feel put upon, which was silly and understandable. \u201cThank you for not calling me an idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have not earned idiot,\u201d Marta said. \u201cAlso, I am old enough and have been cruel enough to know when to keep my mouth closed. I will text you a plan for tomorrow. Do not worry about me watching the video again. I know what your face looks like when you pretend to be having fun for other people. You were having fun. That scares me less and more at the same time.\u201d There was a tiny sound like a fingertip against glass. \u201cEat something with salt and something green. Tell your sister to sleep before midnight for once. And, Nell\u2014stop counting mailboxes while you talk to me. Be where you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am in the hall,\u201d Nell said, because she had the impulse to be charming and corrected it into honest. \u201cI am a little stupid in the hall.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Marta said, and hung up in the graceful way she had of ending conversations precisely when they had said what they needed to. Nell stood with the dial tone trying to pretend it was important and then slid the phone into her back pocket and breathed like a person who had been given terms instead of doom.\n\nAmbrose\u2019s email bled cheer onto her retinas when she opened it. The showcase had a name that sounded like a cereal, and it would be held in a converted brewery that had been converted into a \u201ccreative space\u201d and then converted into an excuse for a thousand cameras to stare at food. There was pay. There was rehearsal that was absolutely not rehearsal. There were rules that were a paragraph longer than the State\u2019s and wore their logic like perfume. Ambrose had written her a note at the end, a little italicized aside that said, Think of it like a dance. Only with a worse playlist. I\u2019ve copied Vera because I am talented at pretending to be formal. He had included a photo of a goat with the subject line: surveillance, which made her laugh in a sudden loud bark that brought Ivy into the hall with her eyebrows up near her hairline.\n\n\u201cGoats?\u201d Ivy said, peering at the screen upside down and making that face she made when confronting a word problem on no sleep. \u201cWhy is Ambrose sending you goats. Does your uncle by invention think he is courting you with livestock.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Nell said, but she felt the warm spill of joy at being silly allowed to approach her again. She handed the phone to Ivy, who swiped with the authority of someone who swiped for two and then handed it to Mom. Mom blinked at the goat and then at the dollar amount because math lived behind her eyes these days. She made the small humming noise that meant her brain had put us and light bill in the same sentence and was testing the verb.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to become a novelty,\u201d Mom said, carefully, because novelty had been the death of several girls they had known in different neighborhoods. \u201cBut novelty can be rent. You will bring Vera. She is stern in the ways I am tired of being stern.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will bring Vera,\u201d Nell said, and felt the plan slot into the world like something you'd noticed only because it had been missing. The candle guttered and caught itself without help and they all pretended they had not thought about it.\n\nThat night, when they left, the air had gone silk and moths bounced off the porch light as if that were a life goal. Ivy carried the ribbon pinned to the back of her shirt, a joke that made her walk straighter. On the ride home, they let the radio do what it wanted because no one had the energy to wrangle it. They stopped at a red light that had a patience about it, the kind that considers its own contribution to the world. A Jeep rolled up next to them with the windows down and the laugh that fell out of it belonged to a girl from the team. Nora leaned across her passenger and shouted, \u201cPie assassin!\u201d and then laughed at her own cleverness because she always did. Nell flinched and then smiled because both were true. Ivy leaned her elbow out the driver\u2019s window and shouted, \u201cRespect pastry!\u201d which landed with the Jeep as if it had been arranged.\n\nSleep came in the complicated way it always had for Nell: in feints and returns. She slept, then woke, then slept, then had a conversation with a dream about whether the word regurgitate had ever been used in a love poem. When she woke for real, the ribbon had swung itself onto the lamp and looked like an object in a different house. Her muscles felt like they had been charted. She wrote down the plan Marta texted: an easy four, strides on grass, drills that made her feel like a kid again because they were genderless and true. She made coffee and found perpetually the way you find a familiar knob in a dark room.\n\nDovetail was quieter than it had any right to be on a Sunday morning. Vera had put out the chairs in pairs like people, which veered into sentimental if you knew her well. The case gleamed with scones and intention. A health inspector form was tacked to the cork board with a pushpin that wobbled, and there were two supplies boxes open on the floor with their tongues hanging out. Vera looked up from a ledger in which she had been gently arguing with numbers and smiled with only one side of her mouth, a trick that made her look both kind and conspiratorial.\n\n\u201cYou lived,\u201d she said, setting her pen down and crossing her arm bones over her apron as if she could hold her center in place by doing it. \u201cYour mother called me. I have been commended for corrupting a child properly. I will frame it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe likes you,\u201d Nell said, and then added, because she wanted to be honest in this building if nowhere else, \u201cShe\u2019s afraid of you in the right way.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Vera said. \u201cI am an excellent average jerk to people who think they can cheat the end of a recipe. Do you want a biscuit or do you want to confess your sins first.\u201d\n\n\u201cConfess,\u201d Nell said, and told her about Marta in the hall and the terms and the August thing and Ambrose\u2019s underwear drawer of pens. Vera listened like she was paying for listening by the minute, patient and not indulgent, which was how she had learned to be with herself after the dance company had decided it wanted younger pain. When Nell finished, Vera exhaled through her nose in a sound that could have been a prayer in a different religion.\n\n\u201cI can handle your coach,\u201d she said, with the calm of a person who had dealt with professors, choreographers, and the state of Massachusetts. \u201cI will let her plan boredom. You will not think about August until after Providence unless you are bored, which you so rarely are I cannot imagine it. You will find out, while I watch, whether doing something absurd once has bought you joy, or a habit, or both. If Julian shows up here, I will feed him a biscuit and then throw him out with the authority of the Commonwealth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he will show up,\u201d Nell said, because she had been circling that question in her head like a dog doing an old dance on a bed.\n\n\u201cHe is the kind of person who tries doors in other people\u2019s houses,\u201d Vera said, and this was not unkind so much as accurate. \u201cBut he might wait until it matters less to you. Weasels do that. Don\u2019t let your imagination give him more furniture than he brings.\u201d\n\nThey worked then, the satisfying work of wiping and rearranging and deciding what makes a room feel like a room you want to stay in. Ivy came in midmorning with a bag from the hardware store that looked like it contained either nails or candy, because those were her categories. She had gotten them a new push broom because the old one had been tilting like an argument. She set it in the corner like it had taken vows with the mop. She told them about a dream in which Ambrose was married to a goat and Vera smacked her with a dish towel until she remembered she had never been in a church in which vows were made to goats.\n\nThe town did its Sunday thing where it behaves like a bigger place for an hour and then remembers itself again. Mrs. Dalrymple came by and pretended she had not sent any videos to anyone, which was the extent of her guilt. Two of Nell\u2019s teammates came in and gave her a look that said sometimes we think you are collateral, but today we remember you are a person, and they bought croissants like rituals. Someone left a book on the corner table and then came back an hour later to reclaim it with relief that was so naked it made them all look away. The world refused to pick a mood, which was a relief.\n\nAmbrose came by just to be competent at standing. He had one pen in his ear and the others mercifully at home, and he leaned on the case as if it was a question he had put to sleep. \u201cCommittee meeting,\u201d he said, hitching a thumb toward the street in the direction of the community center and the horrible coffee that lived there. \u201cThere was concern about a comment on the video from someone who may or may not be Julian\u2019s cousin. Please remind me to build my own social platform where no one can say anything stupid unless they are in this room and have to do dishes after.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did the cousin say,\u201d Nell asked, because her curiosity was an animal she could not housebreak.\n\n\u201cThat you had an advantage because you are \u2018small and deceptive,\u2019 which is such a pile of adjectives I had to print it out and put it on my fridge,\u201d Ambrose said. \u201cAlso, that the pies favored your \u2018mouth shape,\u2019 which suggests the world has turned a corner I do not wish to peer around. We have decided to issue a statement that says pies favor no one and we love everyone unless they are on fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good at your job,\u201d Vera said, pouring him coffee that could wake a dead idea, and he took the compliment with a wince. It made something warm with a shadow move in Nell, the way seeing competence in a person always did, as if she were being issued a small piece of permission to continue.\n\nAt noon Marta appeared, hair still wet at the ends like she had punished herself with a cold shower, carrying a bag with the way a soldier carries anything that might explode. She set it on a chair and then stood behind it like a person looking over a small balcony. Vera\u2019s mouth tightened the way people\u2019s mouths do when they have complicated respect to deliver. They shook hands and the handshake had the feel of a meeting between two sovereign nations who had decided to share a river.\n\n\u201cI am here to propose peace,\u201d Marta said, without preamble. \u201cIt will involve broccoli. I apologize.\u201d\n\n\u201cApologies accepted and refused,\u201d Vera said. \u201cI will make you like my broccoli and you will resent me for it and we will both do our jobs.\u201d She gestured to a small table where the light was good but not cruel. \u201cSit.\u201d\n\nThey sat. They opened the bag and there were greens and a notebook and a printout with underlines. Ivy attempted to hover and Vera installed her at a different table with a scone and an instruction to count the number of people who came in wearing hats, which Ivy took with the seriousness of a person setting out to reckon with a census. Nell perched with her hands folded because that posture made her feel like her best version of a student. Marta and Vera discussed fuel the way some people discuss truce lines: what goes in, when, in what company, and how to tell the truth about it when your body wants to lie. They made lists with arrows and crossed-out jokes and a column that said emergencies. Nell watched them and felt the gratitude that rises only when two people care in different ways about the same ridiculous thing and agree to be kind anyway.\n\n\u201cHere is the main thing,\u201d Marta said, tapping the page until the paper thought it was being spoken to. \u201cNo heroics in the dark. If you feel your body starting to bargain with you at night, you text me, and you text me the words \u2018I am bargaining,\u2019 and I will tell you a boring story about my aunt\u2019s garden until you fall asleep. No extra miles on mornings after you have done stupid or even after you have only thought about doing stupid. No fasting. No dessert before practice like you are a saint. No sainting.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sainting,\u201d Nell said, and felt something unclench in the middle of her. \u201cI like dessert before practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you do,\u201d Marta said. \u201cThat is why I said it out loud. You will find other rebellions.\u201d\n\nThey signed the plan like it was a pact with a small dog. Vera made a broccoli salad in the back with the kind of skill that made people propose and plated it with a flourish that would have gotten her thrown out of several kitchens. Marta ate it with a face that was both skeptical and resigned, which was as close to praise as some people get. The light in Dovetail slid along the floor and made the chair legs look as if they were practicing for a show.\n\nIn the afternoon, while the coffee went slack and the scone tray looked picked-over and therefore attractive, Nell went for her easy four. She cut the loop small because her negotiation muscles were tired and she did not trust herself near the long route where the elm made her think about history more than was good for a person who needs to be present. The sidewalks still did their tricks and she still knew every root. She ran past the war memorial and past the stoop where the old men took turns saying yes and no like a seam and past the house with the broken wind chime that sounded like a lazy spoon. Her legs felt like they were trying to remember a dream and she let them tabulate their own kind of data until they were reassured.\n\nAt the turn by Central Street, a car honked a friendly honk and it was Ray, arm hanging out the window like a flag, driving an absurd minivan that had the secrets of a dozen field trips welded to its chassis. He leaned across and shouted something about \u201cworms\u2019 summer camp,\u201d and she laughed and nodded and ran on, lighter for it. At the next block she had the odd sensation of being watched from the wrong angle, and when she glanced she saw nothing but a kid on a scooter and a woman carrying a fern as if it were a child and a man with the posture of someone who had decided to be sad in public. The feeling took a few steps to shake. She tucked it into the place she kept things that might not be real and she ran anyway.\n\nAt home, water tasted like the best part of the day. Ivy had made a late lunch of things that were shapes: triangles of toast, coins of cucumber, a pile of squares that had been cheese before she made them into jokes. They ate and read Ambrose\u2019s email again because it kept changing as their capacity for worrying changed. Ivy had started a list titled Names For Goats and then crossed that out and written People We Are Not Becoming, which included: someone who yells at referees at children\u2019s games, someone who keeps their nails long for typing, someone who pretends they don\u2019t cry at parades, someone who says artisanal twice a day, and someone who calls pie a \u201cjourney.\u201d\n\nThe evening brought with it the blue that makes windows into mirrors. Nell sat with her notebook open and did not write her story that had been assigned because she had borrowed all her adjectives for the day and did not want to be in debt to herself. She wrote instead three sentences about a girl who had excellent lungs and no use for them and then crossed the sentences out because they were not hers. The ribbon had moved again on its own, this time to the back of a chair, a small red insinuation that character had been awarded. It made the apartment look like a room you might warn a guest about even as you offered it.\n\nWhen the knock came, it was not dramatic. It was a polite little fingerprint of noise. Ivy went to the door with the deliberate gait of someone who is back in a play and put one eye to the peephole and then hissed, \u201cVera,\u201d and opened it with her whole face. Vera stepped in with her coat unbuttoned and a look in her eye that meant either someone had died or someone had done paperwork. She held up a printed piece of paper with the posture of a witch displaying a prophecy.\n\n\u201cThe health inspector report,\u201d she said, in a tone that made both of them momentarily stupid. \u201cWe got a B. The part where I place my faith in bleach and heat has been found lacking in a corner I forgot existed. I will fix it by breathing on it properly. But\u2014there\u2019s a note. An anonymous tip to revisit storage because \u2018a competitor in an eating competition has been seen practicing on premises.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that the sentence.\u201d\n\nThey read the sentence a second time because it slid off the brain the first. The words anonymous tip carried with them the smell of letters cut out of a magazine and glued to a threat, even if in reality it was probably an email written from a phone on a toilet. Ivy hissed through her teeth without meaning to because Ivy\u2019s body had always spoken before her mouth could. Nell felt the heat rise up her neck in a way she believed was visible to satellites.\n\n\u201cJulian,\u201d Ivy said, not bothering to dress it as a question because she had always been at her best when assuming things about people she disliked.\n\n\u201cOr the cousin. Or the lady with the pinched mouth. Or Mrs. Dalrymple because she thought she was doing her civic duty. Or a person who enjoys being relevant,\u201d Vera said evenly, because assuming takes a particular kind of fuel and she was saving hers for scrubbing the corner.\n\n\u201cI can stop,\u201d Nell said, and heard how quickly she had allowed herself to become smaller in the face of a small thing. \u201cI can keep it out of your room.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can be seen for ten years eating so much as a grape on these premises for all I care,\u201d Vera said, her mouth making a shape that had not been used yet today. \u201cThat is not the point. The point is that the world will always tell you that your jokes are a threat to their refrigerators. If a man were training to drink seventeen beers in our back room for a money prize, they would call it a fundraiser and make shirts. We will clean. We will pass. We will be boring in exactly the way one has to be boring to keep being interesting. But I wanted you to see it and decide whether you wanted to give someone the satisfaction of changing your shape.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Nell said, and felt the pronoun like a plank she could stand on. \u201cBut I also don\u2019t want to be the reason your pushpin wobbles.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not the wobble,\u201d Vera said, and put the paper on the table like a thing they would eat for dinner just to prove a point. \u201cI want you to know there will be days in August when some anonymous cousin will think their text defines you. It doesn\u2019t. The only thing that defines you is how you put your hand on the table when you\u2019re sure or scared. I have watched you do both. That is my report.\u201d\n\nThey drank tea like old men with opinions and made a plan to flush the corner with vinegar and hot water and the force of their combined competence. Vera left with the paper rolled in her fist like a wand. Ivy stood at the door with the old broom in her hand like a weapon and then laughed at herself and leaned it back into its corner. Nell went to the window and looked out at the street where the elm dropped whatever it was dropping these days and felt a steadiness land in her feet like a friend sitting down.\n\nLater, in bed, she reached for her phone because bad habits are also nests and checked a new wave of messages. There was one from Ray: You okay? With a photo of a worm someone had drawn a face on. There was one from Tina: That cousin is a spoon with opinions. Let\u2019s go for a run sometime that is not about vomiting. There was one from a number she did not know that said only, They don\u2019t deserve you, which made her laugh because it is a sentence that does not mean anything and sometimes is exactly the one you need. There was one from Ambrose: Sorry about the tip. I will weaponize my pens. The goat remains on surveillance. And there was one from Marta: Tomorrow, grass. Bring your ridiculous socks. Eat dinner that feels like ballast.\n\nShe set the phone facedown and lay there with her hands on her stomach and felt, in a way she could not have the day before, both full and hungry in the usefully literal and the complicated metaphorical ways. She thought of the brewery that used to be a factory that used to be a field that used to be a river and imagined herself under its lights with a towel and a heart that was not afraid of being funny in public. She thought of the Providence course and the way it curved like a promise around the last hill. She thought of Julian\u2019s sunglasses jostling uselessly on the top of his head, and of Vera\u2019s scowl that was love, and of Ivy\u2019s list of people they were not becoming, and of her mother\u2019s candle that would still be burning low on the kitchen table long after midnight because someone had needed to light it. She let herself fall into sleep like a person who had decided, briefly, that the door could stay open without a draft.",

Nell ran into it the way a person walks into a room and waits for their eyes to learn the furniture. The early air tasted like someone had wrung out a washcloth over the town, and the sidewalks took their mischief seriously, heaving up where maple roots had conspired and smoothing out where a winter patch job had learned to be polite. She tried out the new word in her list without giving it the dignity of a place. Mailbox, stop sign, elm, bench, war memorial, pie. It was a joke and a dare and it sat between the others as if it had always belonged there, like a cousin at Thanksgiving who brings the good rolls and gets forgiven for everything else.\n\nCoach Marta had written in her text the night before: tempo, light, keep your shape. Nell translated it into the language her legs understood, which wasn\u2019t words so much as a low hum under the skin. She warmed up along the track with Jess narrating someone else\u2019s drama at full volume and Nora doing her funny little pre-run hop that looked like a ritual she would deny if asked. Marta stood with her stopwatch and her mouth in a line that could mean anything from congratulations to funeral, which was comforting because you could not be singled out by a line. The grass along the infield had been trimmed in obedient rows, short enough to show off the divots like bad decisions, and the sky was a flat sheet of paper someone had forgotten to write on.\n\n\u201cFour by twelve,\u201d Marta said, pitching her voice so it landed in their bones, not just their ears. \u201cOn the minute. I want polish, not bravado. You are not auditioning for an audience. You are scrubbing your own kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that personal,\u201d Jess asked, deadpan and brave, and Marta gave the half-smile she rationed out like a teacher who knows praise is currency and inflation is real. Nell shook out her arms and caught the eye of a freshman she didn\u2019t know yet, a small face under a too-big ponytail. The girl looked at Nell\u2019s shoes as if they might answer a question. Nell said hi because you always say hi when somebody looks to your shoes for instruction.\n\nThe first twelve hundred felt like someone had mopped the track and left it damp. Her stride had been fiddled with by the week, but it settled under her like a cat that likes you but only on its terms. On the back stretch Jess breathed like a person telling a secret and Nora\u2019s feet made a rhythm that could beat out the boundaries of a song. Nell found the line between ease and effort and put her hand on it, polite but firm. She had the ridiculous moment\u2014mid-second lap\u2014where the hiccup memory from Riverbend visited with the cheerfully malicious air of a relative. She did what Vera had taught her without breaking pace, tongue to the roof of her mouth, breath deep and low, the smallest permission to relax where everything wanted to clench. The hiccup considered her and went away the way certain men do when you meet their gaze without apology.\n\nBetween repeats, Marta came down the line like a conductor, tap to shoulder, a syllable for each of them: light, hips, patience, you\u2019re fine, you\u2019re not dying, stop bargaining. When she got to Nell, she was almost gentle. \u201cYour arms are telling on you,\u201d she said, and Nell looked down at the swinging motion she thought she had tamed. She dialed it down on the next one, made the swing small enough to belong to a person who didn\u2019t need to prove she owned her shoulders. The third twelve hundred hurt with the familiar moral clarity of a thing you chose. On the fourth, she felt the little engine that lived between her ribs engage, and it was the particular relief of something you have repaired working in public.\n\nThey cooled in a loose parade while Marta timed a boy with a chest like a narrow boat and pretended she did not know they watched each other when they pretended not to. Deion from the throwers ambled past with a discus cradled like a dinner plate, and shouted, \u201cPie-face!\u201d as if he\u2019d been waiting to be the first one to use it to her actual face and wanted the credit. Nell bowed her head and accepted the baptism with what grace she owned and Jess made a cawing noise that meant approval and mockery in equal parts. The freshman came up shyly when Marta went to consult her clipboard, and tilted her body in that way of girls who want to ask without asking.\n\n\u201cWas it\u2026fun,\u201d the girl said, and the word fun did not sound unserious in her mouth. It sounded like something she was inspecting for cracks.\n\n\u201cIt was.\u201d Nell did not qualify it, even though every sentence in her life had been lately dressed in disclaimers like sweaters. \u201cAnd it was gross, and I counted my breaths, and I loved the people around me more than I love them on a normal Tuesday. Those things can all be true.\u201d\n\nThe girl nodded with the face of someone filing away a piece of instruction for a future use that would not be what the instructor intended. Nora slung an arm around Nell\u2019s sweaty shoulders and spoke as if her voice were a megaphone. \u201cOkay, pie assassin, come eat real food,\u201d she said. \u201cCoach made me promise not to offer you anything that isn\u2019t on the list and I will honor that by exactly fifty-one percent.\u201d\n\nThe day proceeded with the indignities and tiny uplifts that make up most days. She stopped at Dovetail because the pull was muscle memory now, and because Vera had texted a photograph of two storage shelves labeled with that precise neatness that cowed inspectors: flour, sugar. There was a little laminated sign, new and earnest, that said Training area: dish pit and nowhere else, which made Nell laugh in a way that was a little bit like crying. Vera was in conference with a man whose badge said Health in a font that didn\u2019t make it look trustworthy, and she was nodding at a speed that signaled irritated cooperation. He took a temperature with an instrument that looked like it had been designed to interrogate astronauts and affixed a new sticker to the inside of the dish washer with a ceremonious pat.\n\n\u201cWe are so clean I could be convicted,\u201d Vera said, when he had left and the door had done its jingle that was less a jingle than a shrug. \u201cHow is running.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a thing that shows you what you\u2019ve been lying about,\u201d Nell said, and they stood in the calm that follows a health inspection, which is similar to the calm that follows a small storm when you are still counting up your roof shingles.\n\nAmbrose had left a paper bag with his name written too carefully on the top and a drawing of a goat in the corner. It contained an unholy number of pens and a note that said, The committee would like our finalists to submit a thirty-second introduction video. You, your towel, no props, your voice, no goats. Consider this your homework. He had underlined no goats twice and drawn a tiny goat under the second underline as if to apologize to himself. Ivy came in while Nell was staring at the note like it was a small animal and immediately tried to put one of the pens in her hair like a barrette.\n\n\u201cYou will puncture your brain,\u201d Vera said, with sisterly patience she had learned for this family.\n\n\u201cMy brain is resilient,\u201d Ivy said, and then in a different voice to her sister, a voice that contained more private ground, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be on people\u2019s phones. Are we going to let them in, or are we going to stand in the doorway and make them take their shoes off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be anyone\u2019s welcome mat,\u201d Nell said, which was true and not dramatic, and Ivy kissed her elbow in a way that sounded like an agreement.\n\nThey did the thing the note asked in the back alley behind Dovetail, because Vera had declared the kitchen itself off-limits to amateur cinema and because the light in the alley at that hour made everyone look like they had slept. Ivy stood on a milk crate to get the angle she insisted was flattering and scolded a recycling bin for thinking it had the right to be in the frame. Nell tried three versions of herself in thirty seconds: clipped and competent, careless and funny, sincere to the point of embarrassment. The clipped one sounded like she was auditioning to be Ambrose. The careless one tasted false even as the words came out. The sincere one made Ivy put her hand over her mouth in the way people do when they hear a note that hits something in their teeth.\n\n\u201cI hate that one,\u201d Nell said, because hating it was part of its honesty.\n\n\u201cSend it,\u201d Ivy said, and Vera, hovering under the pretense of wiping a clean counter, nodded once like a vote cast.\n\nAt the track that evening, a local reporter materialized at the fence with a notebook and a face that had learned how to be friendly for a living. The paper was a tidy thing that did births and obituaries in their correct boxes and had room on Wednesdays for a column about pets who needed sweaters. The woman called Nell\u2019s name through the chain link in a way that came so close to respect that it would have been rude to ignore. Marta appeared beside Nell like a summoned angel whose toys include clipboards and glances that make cameras flinch.\n\n\u201cTwo minutes,\u201d Marta said, and the reporter adjusted in real time, collapsing paragraphs into something that could fit between stretches. \u201cWe are on a plan. We respect plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the reporter said, pleasant and doomed. She asked the questions everyone had landed on because they seemed to arrange themselves into a narrative without anyone working too hard: running and pie, discipline and silliness, whether she was trying to prove something to herself or to pie. Nell answered with the truth she could afford to share on a weekday. It was fun. It was ridiculous. It was hers. The reporter asked if she thought it was fair to the other runners, the ones who weren\u2019t filling their stomachs with pastry, and Marta answered that one for her with a smile that had lost its innocence decades before. Fair has never been invited to this sport, she said, and the reporter wrote it down with a grateful shoulder.\n\nIt was not until she was walking home alone, later than she\u2019d planned and with the light already folded under the houses, that the day offered her its dose of unasked-for narrative. A car idled at the stop sign by Central with its windows down and a song spilling out that had been popular ten summers ago. She would not have noticed it because cars idle and songs spill, but the car did the thing cars do when they are not sure whether to turn right or to stare. She cut across onto her street and it slid forward the way a insect glides along a rim. It could have been nothing. It was most likely nothing. But nothing does not lift the hairs on your arms like fact.\n\nShe kept her pace the way Marta taught them to keep their form in the last thirty meters when everything in them wants to bargain on the new terms of fatigue. She did not take out her phone because phones glare when you need them to be discreet. She counted the shadows on the sidewalk and wished none of them were hers. When the car turned down a cross street without signaling, something in her chest downgraded its alarm from siren to clock. On the corner where the store that used to sell records now sold seven versions of the same scented candle, Ray\u2019s absurd minivan pulled up to the curb with a squeal that had a personality.\n\n\u201cHardwick,\u201d he called, leaning over the passenger seat like a kid at the beach, \u201cdo you know anything about an earthworm exhibit that refuses to be contained in one classroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I know who would use the phrase \u2018earthworm exhibit\u2019 as if it\u2019s an escaped lion,\u201d she said, and her voice came out warmer than her skin felt. He was already half out of the car, letting a fifth grader\u2019s soccer ball roll like a round dog under the brake. He followed her gaze to where the car had been and found it full of nothing.\n\n\u201cYou good,\u201d he said quietly, because some men know when to lower the volume without being told by a woman to do it.\n\n\u201cI got to practice being paranoid responsibly,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Tell your worms I respect their organizing principles.\u201d\n\nHe grinned and made her tell him about the goats again and she did, because telling stories that end in laughter is a way to make a street belong to you after you have spooked yourself on it. When she got home, Ivy had piled two oranges and a sad apple into a bowl in the middle of the table like a still life that would be graded. She listened and frowned and put the apple back in the fridge as if this could reverse the omen. They locked both locks and then they laughed at themselves and then they didn\u2019t, because both could be true.\n\nThe anonymous tip to the health department turned out to be the first in a set, the way one ant at a picnic becomes a map if you stand still long enough to watch it. Vera found a review on a site beloved by aunts and men who work in offices, claiming with confidence that Dovetail had \u201clet standards slip, probably because of\u2026you know,\u201d which would have been funny if you didn\u2019t work there or love someone who did. Ivy printed it and wrote under it, in pen so thick the paper wrinkled, \u201cyou know is the name of my lawyer,\u201d and taped it to the underside of their kitchen chair where talismans went when you lived in a place that didn\u2019t respect altars.\n\nTina met Nell on the conservation trail two afternoons later, when the weather had decided to be kind and you could pretend the bugs were music. Tina always looked like a person having the best idea in the room and deciding not to mention it because it wouldn\u2019t help. They ran side by side and did not pretend not to judge each other\u2019s cadence. At the boardwalk, Tina asked about Julian with polite interest that could easily turn into amusement if given permission.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of man who thinks a handkerchief counts as a personality,\u201d Nell said, and Tina snorted and scared a dragonfly into a new path.\n\n\u201cI used to date a handkerchief,\u201d Tina said. \u201cHe destarched himself and became a towel and that was better. There\u2019s a rumor he\u2019s got a cousin who handles his entries. There\u2019s a rumor he\u2019s trying to finagle a sponsor by making a fuss wherever he goes. There\u2019s a rumor he doesn\u2019t like to lose to women, which is a rumor you can have about any man without straining your imagination. The useful part is that he wants attention, and wanting it is the same as rehearsing your own downfall.\u201d\n\n\u201cUseful,\u201d Nell said, and tucked it away like a spare safety pin.\n\nThey talked about bodies then, the way you do when you are running away from other people\u2019s opinions about your body, which is to say they compared notes about salt and sleep and the way your stomach sometimes turns into a person on a picket line. Tina told her how the year she turned thirty she stopped counting calories and started counting the number of times she laughed so hard she had to bend over, and how the second number brought the first into line without anyone asking it. Nell told Tina about a notebook she had kept when she was twelve where she listed everything she had eaten that day on paper shaped like a flower, and how the petals had felt like scolding and pretty at the same time.\n\nThey parted at the little parking lot where a pickup with a broken tail light had been parked so long it had become part of the scenery. The driver had drawn a smiley face in the layer of dust that lived on its hood, and someone else had added a mustache to it. The world retained its capacity for harmless vandalism in every season.\n\nHer creative writing professor had returned her last story with a sentence at the top that was two compliments in a trench coat and one complaint with its hands on its hips. Overwrought in an earnest way, he had said, the same broadcast he had offered in a different unit, as if repetition would make it less annoying. She read it to Ivy in the kitchen while they cut bread in indecently thick slices and buttered it the way their father had taught them, like a person trying to make a mistake permanent. Ivy raised a hand to interrupt and announced that the only over-wrought thing in this apartment was the lamp cord she had failed to repair three times. They performed a little ritual where they threw the professor\u2019s name into the air like salt and then they ate their bread and the critique tasted faint and far away.\n\nAmbrose texted that the video had been deemed acceptable by the powers that be, and that someone at the network had declared Nell\u2019s face \u201ctruthful,\u201d which she decided to accept as a compliment even though it sounded like a charge in a court case. He said somebody wanted to come to Dovetail to get b-roll of her doing something that looked like \u201ctraining,\u201d and Vera replied from three exclamation points away with a list of thirteen activities that would not occur in her kitchen while a camera was present. It was negotiable, the way all things are when you have already decided who you are in the room.\n\nThe week staged itself into shape. Nell learned how to look at the ribbon without thinking of the goats. She added yardage the way you add water to a sauce and hope no one will notice. Marta caught her on a Wednesday almost-smile after drills and unbent her mouth into a real one with a story about a time she had tried to be cool in front of a triple jumper and sprained dignity instead. The anonymous rain let up for a day and then returned with a comment on a message board that said, Pies are for grandmas, not athletes, which made Nell laugh so hard she had to hold her ribs while Ivy printed it and taped it to their toilet seat at a perfect angle.\n\nThen there was the email that came not from Ambrose, or Marta, or any person whose name she could picture, but from an address that contained the words manyeyes and truth in a way that made her shoulders climb. It said only, You\u2019re not as good as you think you are, and the subject line was a quote from an obscure country song her father had liked that went, You can\u2019t outrun your appetite. Ivy was the one who opened it first because she had gotten to the phone in that fast way she had of always arriving at trouble a second before anyone else. She did not show Nell until after she had made a noise in the back of her throat that would have worried a doctor.\n\nThey stood with it on the screen as if standing could make it less true or less false. Nell read it twice because once never did anything for her. She looked out the window where the elm had appointed itself a parliament and where the same man who wore the same hat at the same time every day walked by with his small dog and his big opinions. She put the phone down on the counter as if it contained heat, which, technically, it did.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m good,\u201d she said, eventually, when the air had cooled around them. \u201cI know when I am capable of landing inside my own body. I know the smell of it. I know when I\u2019ve cheated myself. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re good,\u201d Ivy said, still looking at the email as if it would blink first. \u201cBut even if you weren\u2019t, you are ours.\u201d\n\nThey wrote manyeyes into a notebook under a list titled pests and drew a little cartoon of a raccoon next to it. When she went to Dovetail that afternoon, Vera slid a thick manila envelope across the counter as if they were in a movie where someone was about to be recruited for a job they didn\u2019t want. Inside were laminated copies of permits, a copy of the health inspector\u2019s new gold star, and an index card with two phone numbers written in a handwriting that brooked no debate.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this,\u201d Nell said, holding the stack like a child holds homework she thinks might explode.\n\n\u201cThis is me deciding I will be boring with such determination that no anonymous weasel can pry me loose,\u201d Vera said. \u201cAlso, if anyone calls you to ask for comment, you say, \u2018No thank you, please direct all queries to Vera Mercier, proprietor,\u2019 and you hand the phone to me or you hang up and run a mile in a rage which you will then report to Marta like a penitent. I will be the stern one. You may go be ridiculous when the time calls for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already are the stern one,\u201d Nell said, and the relief she felt made her want to put her head down on the counter.\n\nThe Providence course map arrived in her inbox in a PDF that had been designed by someone who loved arrows in a personal way. It curved in the lower quad like a sentence that wanted to be rewritten. The finish line looked benign. Experienced runners had written in the comments about a false flat and a corner that encouraged hubris. Marta printed it in grayscale and wrote her name at the top in a marker that tasted like exams. They sat over it at the community center while a Zumba class thumped on the other side of the partition and talked about splits and tactics and what to do when your stomach remembers it has opinions in the last mile.\n\n\u201cYour job is to arrive at the hill with enough brain to leash the beast inside you,\u201d Marta said, circling a bend like she could rub it into submission. \u201cYou will want to go early because you are arrogant and stubborn and a snake-charmed by small children yelling. You will wait. You will make yourself bored at precisely the moment other people forget how to. Then you will choose when to be interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how to be boring,\u201d Nell said, and both of them laughed because she didn\u2019t.\n\nSaturday brought a block party to their street uninvited, the kind of event that arrives because one neighbor owns a speaker and another owns an extension cord and neither of them believes in quiet. There were hamburgers that tasted like nostalgia and handshakes that had been forgotten and rediscovered after three beers. A girl from the team braided Ivy\u2019s hair into a crown that made her look like a capable martyr. Someone\u2019s cousin grilled corn in its husk, and a toddler staggered by in a shirt that said Born to Nap and proved it in public. Mrs. Dalrymple insisted Nell tell the story of Riverbend to her bridge partner, who had hearing aids turned up so loud that every word sounded like a fax.\n\nAround dusk, when everyone had pretended they weren\u2019t watching the sky, someone lit a string of lanterns that made the block look like a movie set built for a scene where two people admit something on a stoop. Mom came out with a plate of cookies that were the same recipe they had eaten around bad tables and good ones. She handed one to Nell and one to Ivy and kept one for herself and they leaned on the porch railing and ate in synchronized gulps. Mom bumped Nell\u2019s shoulder with her shoulder like they were schoolgirls and said, without preface, \u201cWhen I was your age, I used to eat whole lemons with salt. Nana said it was because I wanted to feel something I could control. She was right. I would eat one now if I still had teeth that felt like they belonged to me. You can borrow any of mine, if you want them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your teeth,\u201d Nell said, and then, because she had been raised by this woman to recognize the shape of what was underneath, \u201cI will take your salt.\u201d\n\nMom nodded as if a transaction had been completed. The lanterns hummed faintly with bugs and the light made everyone\u2019s skin look a little kinder. Across the street, someone put on a song from their own adolescence and four people made the same noise at the first chord.\n\nLater, when the block had fallen into the stage of a party where every action must be announced because nobody hears anything that isn\u2019t laughter, a man she didn\u2019t recognize stopped at the bottom of their steps. He had the posture of somebody who had never met his own spine, and a haircut that believed it was time to be worn unironically again. He said her name the way telemarketers do, with a question mark tucked in, and then smiled when she didn\u2019t step down.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s busy,\u201d Ivy said from the top step, without waiting for context because being reasonable had never been her hobby. The man held out a card with a little flourish and Nell took it without moving her feet. It said something about content and brand in a font that did not look sincere on any document not printed onto a mug.\n\n\u201cWe could do something that respects your journey,\u201d he said, and the word journey made the blood in her cheeks do jokes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to do something that respects our trash can,\u201d Ivy said, tilting her head toward the receptacle in a way that read as both invitation and threat. Vera, coming up the walk with a bowl she had bullied someone into letting her carry, looked as if she might absorb this man into her apron pocket out of a sense of public hygiene. He retreated with a shrug that suggested nothing was ever really a no if you just pronounced your own name confidently. The card lay on the porch in the lost-and-found category of objects that await a wind with taste.\n\nThat night, lying in the heat that had not left the apartment even though all the windows were open and even though the elm had done its whispering, Nell thought about the word brand and had the petty pleasure of dismissing it. She thought instead about the hill at Providence and about a brewery with too much light and a goat under surveillance. She thought about her mother\u2019s salt and Ray\u2019s worms and the laminated permits tucked in a manila envelope that Vera had left under their couch on purpose because you hide the important things where you trip over them when you clean. She fell asleep to the sound of Ivy making a list aloud in the next room\u2014towels, safety pins, gum, socks, a bag for the bag, a pen for Ambrose so we can stop looking at his ears\u2014and the cadence of it was as comforting as any prayer they had stopped saying.\n\nOn Sunday morning, she woke to find a flyer slid under their door, the kind printed in gray on pink paper like a blush. It advertised a community talk at the library: Food, Fitness, and the Female Body, the kind of panel that promises truth and delivers a lot of disappointment with cookies. At the bottom there were three names, one of which was a nutritionist whose website had a stock photo of a woman laughing at a salad, one of which was a yoga instructor who did crow pose in parking lots for clout, and one of which made the skin at the back of Nell\u2019s neck prick like a cat\u2019s when the doorbell rings. Julian Pike. He had appended, in parentheses, competitor and advocate.\n\n\u201cThe audacity,\u201d Ivy said, appearing over her shoulder with her hair in two terrible braids. \u201cHe\u2019s going to come into our library and mispronounce metabolism for the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Nell said, and they both laughed at her because the part of her that loved the world enough to hope for fine had never learned the right time to be quiet. She folded the flyer and put it under a magnet shaped like a pear and looked at it as if looking could make a plan. Vera would go, certainly. Marta might go just to practice clenching her jaw. Ambrose would go if the pens could be justified as costs. Nell wanted very much not to go and felt, at the same time, an itch to fill a chair in the back and know what was being poured into the air they breathed. She liked to be where the weather was made.\n\nShe laced her shoes and went to the track because boring was the thing she had promised herself, and boring sometimes requires attendance. The sun had decided to skip ahead to August and the rubber gave off its ghost of tar. On the back stretch she met Tina, who had the flyer folded into a plane and launched it at the lane lines without asking permission from either physics or the library. It bounced once and fell at their feet with a heavy accuracy.\n\n\u201cYou going,\u201d Tina asked, and her voice was the conversational equivalent of lacing your fingers with someone\u2019s under the table.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Nell said, which was honest and a dodge. \u201cIt smells like trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Tina said cheerfully. \u201cLet\u2019s go anyway and be mealy-mouthed and civilized and then laugh in the parking lot. Bring Vera as weaponry. Bring Ambrose if we want a record. Bring Ray for the worms. Bring your mother because sometimes the only defense against a cousin is a woman who can bake a stew.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need name tags,\u201d Nell said, and they ran, and she allowed herself for five full minutes to think only about the feel of her own breath and the line of her own knee, which is the oldest freedom she knew.\n\nThat afternoon, Marta texted with a picture of a broccoli stalk arranged on a plate to resemble a tree and the caption, Practicing my diplomacy. Ambrose texted an image of a goat with a monocle and the words, Library appropriate. Vera answered the group thread with the sentence, We will be polite until we are not, which struck everyone as a reasonable mission statement for attending any event within town limits. Ivy made a sign and then threw it away because it contained a pun she could not live with.\n\nThe library\u2019s community room had the charming acoustics of a cereal box. The chairs were set in patient rows, the fluorescent lights made everyone\u2019s skin look like it had been smeared with the same beige, and a table at the back offered coffee and cookies that were valiantly trying to be good news. The nutritionist laughed at a salad on her slide deck and used terms that made Marta shift in her seat like a woman being bitten by friendly ants. The yoga instructor spoke about intention and invited the room to breathe, and Vera breathed in the way of someone who would not be told when to breathe by a person in a borrowed scarf.\n\nJulian was late enough to be proud of it. He came in with the woman with the pinched mouth and walked to the front with the carriage of a man who\u2019d once been applauded by a room where applause meant a thing. He said the words competitor and advocate as if they had weights attached that only he could lift. He essayed a little speech about discipline and grit and the sanctity of a pure body that made Nell\u2019s molars ache, and when he got to the part where he started a sentence with, \u201cAs a man, I\u2014\u201d the woman with the pinched mouth, who turned out to be his cousin and not his girlfriend, touched his forearm with a warning so elegant it was almost literature. He swerved, gracelessly, and landed on a platitude that made the room relax because platitudes are harmless even when they intend harm.\n\nNell sat in the back with Vera on one side and Ivy on the other and Ambrose behind them, taking notes with a pen that made no sound. Marta fulfilled her role by scowling with purpose. Ray leaned in the doorway like a peacekeeping force that had taken an oath to be funny only at appropriate times. There came, as there always does, a moment for questions, and a lady from church asked about protein as if it were a nephew. A teenager asked whether she would ever be allowed to like her body or whether she'd spend her whole life renting it to other people\u2019s opinions. The room did a collective intake on that one. The yoga instructor said something about gratitude that was not wrong. The nutritionist said something about labor, and the word landed like an oven door. Julian opened his mouth, and Vera\u2019s hand closed on Nell\u2019s knee under the table with a pressure that said, Be sure.\n\nNell stood up because her legs did it on their own and then she had to find words to match the movement. Her voice sounded like it had walked out into the hallway and turned back to look at her. She kept it simple because complexity is suspect in rooms like this.\n\n\u201cI run,\u201d she said, and her own teammates and her coach and her mother all snorted in their private registers because it was a silly way to begin and also the only true way. \u201cI also sometimes eat pies very quickly, for charity and for a ribbon that means less to the world than it does to me. Both make me pay attention to my body in different directions. Some days I am careful. Some days I am stupid. I am practicing both. I would like the room to remember that women are allowed to be multiple without apologizing and that the only people who get to be purists are monks and even they have soup.\u201d\n\nThere was a small scatter of laughter and a murmur that could have been applause if it had been given permission. Julian smiled with half his mouth in her direction, and Ambrose wrote something down that he underlined, which likely meant he thought it was a joke he could use later. The meeting trickled into the kind of chatter that means everybody is pretending the part that interested them most did not interest them at all, and then the coffee did its job and the cookies disappeared and the fluorescent lights pressed their palms on everyone\u2019s heads and blessed them into the parking lot.\n\nIn the lot, under the elm that had migrated into every scene she cared about, Vera said, \u201cSoup,\u201d like she was testing the word and found it sound. Marta put a hand on Nell\u2019s shoulder and squeezed the muscle there as if testing a bridge. Ivy climbed into the back of Ambrose\u2019s car and announced she was stealing him and his pens, and he smiled with his shoulders and handed Vera a pen because he was learning. Ray said something about earthworms that made the yoga instructor laugh for the first time all night in a way that did not sound like it had been purchased.\n\nThey went home by the long way, past the bakery, past the lamplight that makes certain porches look like place settings, and past a window where a couple were arguing quietly in the way of people who know better than to be honest loudly. Nell felt the day settle into its layered self. There was a hill to be climbed in Providence and a camera to humor in a brewery and a pantry corner to keep clean in perpetuity. There was a cousin with a mouth and a man with sunglasses and a town that would be small forever and large in exactly the ways that mattered. She slid the ribbon out of its place on the chair and hung it on a nail in the hallway where her bathrobe used to be, and the sight of it there made it more ordinary and therefore more hers.\n\nBefore bed, she took out her notebook and wrote the kind of sentence she would have rolled her own eyes at three months ago: I am allowed to care about stupid things. Then she wrote, in smaller letters, I am not allowed to be cruel to the person I was before I cared. She shut the notebook gently because people in apartments could feel it when you slammed things, and she lay in the dark listening to the hum the building made when everyone was sleeping and some machine we never think about was still doing its job. In the morning she would go to the track and count her breaths and count her triggers and say the word pie somewhere where it didn\u2019t belong until it learned to, and the day after that she would learn something else about how to be bored until the moment to be interesting arrived and announced itself with a clarity that could not be mistaken for anything but permission.",

They left Stoughton in the thin light that makes everything look temporarily holy, dragging breath and bags down the stairs while the elm offered its opinion in the soft rattle of leaves. Ivy packed and repacked the bag in the way of people who believe organization is a spell you have to cast three times before it takes. She narrated the contents for the car as if she were keeping the inventory alive by speaking it: pins, tape, ridiculous socks, gum that tastes like a childhood mistake, towel that is newer than it looks, a bag for the bag which is, I admit, excessive. Their mother pressed a small jar of salted lemon into Nell\u2019s palm like a relic, and Vera texted a photo of a broom leaned against the labored corner of Dovetail\u2019s pantry with the caption, All clean, go be interesting on purpose. Ambrose sent a goat in a singlet with a speech bubble that said, negative split, which was the kind of joke that makes morning easier without requiring you to laugh out loud.\n\nThe highway did its long hum and the signs for exits read like a poem written by regional food, all diners and chowder and towns that keep their secrets. Ivy drove with her whole body, coaxing the car with her shoulder as if it had feelings that could be persuaded. They said almost nothing for fifteen minutes because silence is a luxury in a family that lives the way they do, and then they said too much too fast because nerves are noisy. \u201cBoring until interesting,\u201d Ivy said at one point, as if she were testing the phrase on the air to see if it would stay suspended or sink. \u201cLeash the beast inside you when you get to the hill,\u201d she said a moment later, doing her best impression of Marta\u2019s clipped cadence. Nell smiled because her mouth knew how to do that in any weather, and she let the words settle like ballast in her chest where panic sometimes tried to rent a room.\n\nProvidence was already bustling at the edges when they hit downtown, a particular Sunday buzz of athletes and people who had forgotten their road would be closed and were already composing their disdain. The river looked like a ribbon laid down to prove a point, and the start arch inflated with a wheeze that gave everyone permission to take the day seriously. The team gathered in the agreed-upon patch of grass that had been circled in Marta\u2019s grayscale printout, stretching out like cats, shaking legs like men in rooms where women teach them to dance. Jess narrated the field at full volume, assigning nicknames to people she had never met, and Nora did her tiny hop and proclaimed herself full of gluten and destiny in equal measures. Marta stood with her stopwatch worn high as a sternum and her jaw arranged for usefulness, not comfort, and when she saw Nell she lifted a hand just enough to say, I see you, which did more than any paragraph could have.\n\nBib pickup was a miracle of efficiency for once, and the safety pins found their corners without bloodshed. Someone at the table said, \u201cPie girl,\u201d under their breath, and then apologized for saying it out loud, and Nell felt the odd relief of being identified and the quieter joy of the apology in the same breath. She jogged her warm-up in a rectangle Marta had drawn across the pavement with a sentence about staying out of everyone\u2019s way, and she counted because counting keeps everything else at bay: bark in a crack, chalk X, pothole that looks like a lake in miniature, a man in an orange hat who could have been a lighthouse if he had cared to. The air smelled like coffee spilled on paper and river damp, and the sound of hundreds of people faking calm made a separate hum inside the morning that only runners hear.\n\nOn the line, where tape pretends to be important, Nell felt the old familiar theatre of it settle around her like a jacket that had been made to her measurements. She shook out her wrists because she had decided that was part of the ritual now, and found a piece of sky beyond the arch where there was nothing to look at and looked at it, because empty is sometimes better than faces. Jess leaned over and bumped her shoulder and said, \u201cBored first, interesting later,\u201d as if she were reading off the day\u2019s liturgy, and Nora whispered a sentence so filthy and encouraging that it had to be true, and Marta came down the line and touched two fingers to Nell\u2019s sleeve once, the way piano teachers correct wrists, and then she stepped back and became the person who times, because that is how she writes love letters.\n\nThe horn came and went like weather and the wave pulled them around the first corner with that delicious false feeling that you could do this forever. Nell\u2019s legs felt like instruments she had chosen thoughtfully instead of randomly, and there was room inside her steps for her lungs to be people with opinions without becoming dictators. A man in a shirt that said Eat More Kale shouted, \u201cPie!\u201d in a tone that could have been affectionate or accusing, and she did not turn her head because heads should not be turned on mile one except to avoid a stroller. The false flat did its mischief at mile two and a half, just as the comments section on the course map had promised in its smug way, and you could see the bodies around her learning the difference between what eyes want and what feet know. She kept her shape, which is to say she did not bargain, which is to say she let her arms be quiet and her breath be a metronome that would not be flattered into speeding up.\n\nShe passed the coffee shop where someone had once said a sentence on a first date that made her decide not to love him, and next to it a barber pole that looked like ambition. The river smelled less like itself near the bridge and more like the city, and a woman with a brass bell rang it like she meant to break it, and a little boy in a cape yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re fast!\u201d at everyone indiscriminately because magnanimity is a specialty of certain five-year-olds. The hill announced itself with the necessary lack of drama and then did exactly what a hill is built to do. This was where certain parts of the brain volunteered to be generals and should not be allowed near the map. This was where she remembered the sentence Marta had circled on the grayscale: arrive at the hill with enough brain to leash the beast, and it felt almost ceremonial, the way putting a leash on something you love but do not trust can feel kinder than refusing to love it at all.\n\nHer hiccup ghost showed up right on cue, cheerful and malicious as ever, and she did the thing with her tongue and the roof of her mouth, and she softened her jaw in the way Vera had coached her with the tenderness of someone undoing a knot in a chain. She took the hill like a thing that wasn\u2019t hers yet but could be rented, one installment at a time, and she let the girl in the purple shoes go because purple shoes make bad decisions and then make you pay for their confidence later. Nora yelled her name into the hill\u2019s flank and it was both a command and a celebration, and Jess clapped her hands on the down stroke like a metronome for people who require performance to keep time. At the crest, where the city looks briefly like it could be forgiven for everything, she allowed herself the smallest taste of relief and then put it away like an expensive spice.\n\nThere was the corner\u2014the one that wanted to encourage hubris\u2014and she didn\u2019t let it, which was a small private victory she could keep in her pocket for dark mornings. A man in front of her did what men do when corners tell them they are faster than they are, and he surged and then discovered physics still applied to his life, and she stepped past his small disillusionment with the respect you give a baptism. Her legs began to negotiate with the future, which is always a mistake, and she brought them back to the room with the sternness of a teacher who knows which children can handle a certain kind of stern. She thought once, deliberately and softly, of Riverbend\u2014the clang, the blue on her teeth, the way her body had believed her when she said we are capable of this nonsense\u2014and the memory folded neatly into the space where doubt had been rehearsing.\n\nThe last half mile opened like the end of a long explanation, and she looked for the banner not with desperation but with that keen affection you save for things you have earned in small coins. She heard her name correctly and incorrectly in the mouths of strangers and in the familiar vowels of the people who know the sound a door in their apartment makes. She thought about forcing, and did not. She thought about sandbagging, and did not. She let the beast off the leash for three hundred meters exactly, and it ran in the shape she asked it to, which is as close to love as some of us get in a morning. The line arrived on time for once and she crossed it still herself, which felt like the best outcome the day could have written.\n\nThe clock said what clocks say when you have been boring until it mattered, and Marta\u2019s eyebrows did the small movement that meant she had to respect you against her better judgment. It wasn\u2019t a gaudy personal best that would require you to post about it and pretend humility. It was a clean, shining scrape off a number that had felt welded in place last season, and it was achieved the way she had promised herself it would be achieved: with quiet math and no bargains. She bent with her hands on her knees like a human being, not a hero, and saw in the tops of her shoes the scuffs she collected the way other people collect nicknames. Ivy hit her a second later like a joyful meteor and then reeled back with an apology and then did it again because that was the language they had developed and no one could make them stop speaking it.\n\n\u201cBored until interesting,\u201d Ivy shouted into her hair, which was an insult to any notion of cool and entirely on brand for her. \u201cLeashed, and then not leashed, and then glory. Also your face at the hill looked like you were breaking up with it. I\u2019m proud of you and so is my hair, which I braided with victory and four bobby pins.\u201d\n\nMarta appeared and did not hug because hugging is reserved for certain funerals and once, on a day Nell still tells herself she dreamed. She put a hand where the neck meets the shoulder and pressed like a musician testing a note, and then she nodded and said, \u201cYou chose your moment,\u201d which in Marta is a love poem and a thesis defense in five words. Jess poured water on Nell\u2019s head because she is a child with a sense of theatrical timing and Nora did the math out loud for anyone who wasn\u2019t paying attention: \u201cThat\u2019s twelve seconds. Twelve. Think of all the jokes you can make with twelve. That\u2019s a dozen eggs of triumph.\u201d\n\nThe local reporter with the notebook had managed to find them in the mess without tripping over a single foam roller. She asked Nell how it felt and Nell said the unglamorous truth, that it felt like the person she\u2019d been trying to be showed up instead of the one who likes to make speeches. The reporter asked, in a tone attempting to be light, if pie helped, as if pie were a vitamin, and Nell said, very seriously, that you train your lungs in any number of ridiculous ways and you train your mind to not listen to the wrong part of your body at the wrong moment, and that sometimes those lessons learn each other\u2019s names. The reporter wrote it down as if she didn\u2019t know whether it was quotable, which made Nell like her better.\n\nRay materialized out of a knot of fifth graders who had somehow found their way to Providence like dandelion fluff and handed Nell a worm in a small plastic cup like it was a trophy. \u201cWe\u2019re fostering,\u201d he said with all the gravity the situation demanded, and the children nodded as if they had been sworn in. Tina jogged up with the grim delight of someone who had won a private war with her own knee and kissed Nell on the side of the head, ignoring sweat, which is how you separate friends from colleagues. Vera called to say the health inspector had sent a follow-up email that could be framed and that she was making soup that did not include lectures, and Mom texted a string of emojis she thought were lemons but were in fact moons, which was its own kind of blessing.\n\nThey sat on a curb after awards and consumed oranges with a religious fervor that would have gotten them excommunicated in several centuries. The sunlight did that thing where it makes even plastic cups look honest, and a girl they didn\u2019t know asked Nell for a photo because her niece had watched the pie video and thought she was \u201cbrave in a gross way.\u201d Ivy took the picture and made a show of kneeling like a celebrity photographer while Ambrose, who had drifted over from a different set of obligations, cheered with his inside voice and waggled a pen as if it were a small flag. He gave her a printout she didn\u2019t need but would keep anyway, a schedule with boxes for August and a tiny doodle of a goat in the corner that had inexplicably acquired a medal.\n\nOn the drive back, the car smelled like citrus and accomplishment and sweat the same way kitchens smell like butter and arguments, and they let the radio make poor choices because today did not require them to be discerning. Ivy drove with one hand and used the other to list future meals, which served to keep both of them busy with harmless fantasy. \u201cWe will not go to the supper that is ham and three salads no one eats,\u201d she said, invoking Ambrose\u2019s earlier warning as if it were a parable. \u201cWe will eat soup at Vera\u2019s and then we will lie on the floor and let the ribbon rest on the coffee table like a pet. We will not answer any phone calls that begin with the words \u2018content opportunity.\u2019 We will answer calls that begin with \u2018do you want to borrow a casserole dish\u2019 or \u2018are you awake.\u2019\u201d\n\nBack in Stoughton by late afternoon, the town looked smaller only because their eyes were temporarily full. The elm did its confetti of whatever it was dropping in June, and the neighbor across the hall had taped a note to their door that said, Proud of you, you animals, with a heart that could have belonged to any age. They showered the race off, which is to say they peeled off the layer of self-importance and salt and stood still under water like penitents who believe in plumbing. Then they went to Dovetail because joy has routes and that was one of theirs now, and sat at the back table that had decided to belong to them as if it had voted on the matter.\n\nVera ladled soup into bowls that could have been instruments if you held them right, and she salted them the way only people who have spent time with grief and bread know how. \u201cThere is a dignity to being predictable,\u201d she said, sliding the bowls across, and Ivy saluted with a spoon and said, \u201cTo boring,\u201d which made them all laugh because boring had saved the day. They ate without commentary for several minutes because sometimes the most generous thing you can do is leave food alone. Then Vera pulled a manila folder from under the counter and laid it between them like a card in a game none of them pretended not to be playing. \u201cAugust,\u201d she said, and the word felt less like a month than a room they had decided to step into together.\n\nThey made a plan that was not a plan so much as a principle, and they wrote it down not because ink makes things real but because it allowed them to set the page on the table and look at it, which helps. Marta would be present for the parts of the showcase that pretended not to be practice. Vera would say no to anything that smelled like exploitation with lemon cleaner and a lawyer\u2019s posture. Ambrose would translate production into human and provide pens for signing things that should not be signed. Ivy would steal laminated badges and make a deviled egg platter for after that could be transported in a cooler and could sustain a small army if required. Nell would keep her boring, polish it like a coin, and then spend it only when being interesting bought something worth owning.\n\nThe anonymous pests tried their latest and got nowhere, because the post in the same old font that said, Pie is not a sport, arrived in the inbox like a fly and was swatted by the quiet combined disinterest of four women who had decided to spend their afternoon on soup and logistics. Ambrose read it aloud in a voice that made it sound like a grocery list and then folded it into an airplane and sent it into the trash with so little ceremony it felt like dignity. Ray stopped by on his way to a Little League game and left them three tickets with a note that said, Today, worms learned poise, and Tina texted a photo of her knee with a bandage on it and the caption, Fine, I will ice and be humble, leave me alone.\n\nThat night, they took their soup-heavy bellies to Mom\u2019s and produced their accomplishments as if they were bringing over a casserole. The ribbon lay on the table as always, a joke and a pronouncement, and Mom hung it on the back of a chair as if chairs needed medals, which in houses like theirs they do. She told them a story about a county fair when she was their age where she had eaten six ears of corn because a boy with eyelashes had bet she couldn\u2019t, and she confessed she had never told Nana because Nana would have said, Why do you insist on proving yourself to men who cannot cook, and in that moment the kitchen felt like a genealogy of small rebellions. They ate a second dinner because family is many things but rarely sensible, and after dishes they took a walk around the block so the evening could look at their faces and take attendance.\n\nWhen they passed the library, a poster for another panel was already being taped up by a volunteer who believed tape could do anything. The nutritionist had been replaced on the bill by someone who identified as an activist and who had a haircut that would make Vera hostile. Julian\u2019s name had been removed, perhaps by the wind, perhaps by ink, perhaps by a decision made quietly in a room with no windows. Nell felt the space where his letters had been like the absence of a tooth you cannot keep your tongue off, and then she let the feeling pass like a bus carrying people she did not wish to visit. Ivy pulled her down the steps and said, \u201cYou looked like your brain was about to write a monologue. Save it for the brewery. Or save it for the grocery list. We need eggs.\u201d\n\nIn bed, with the window open to a night that smelled green and slightly burned by the day\u2019s sun, Nell lay on her back and catalogued the new things. There was the number on the clock that would show itself differently to her tomorrow because she had carved at it with her stubbornness. There was the steadier feeling in her middle that had not existed the night after Riverbend because she had not yet learned how to choose the boring in public and be proud of it. There was the knowledge that August would come and she would stand under too-bright lights and do something ridiculous with intention while the people she trusted stood just off camera with soup recipes in their pockets and emergency plans in their shoes. There was her mother\u2019s lemon jar on the sill, sweating its small salt into the night air like a prayer, and there was Ivy in the next room talking to herself as if she were interviewing someone famous and the famous person knew all the same jokes they did.\n\nBefore sleep, Nell pulled her notebook across her belly and wrote down a sentence she wanted to forget and remember at once: Today I cared about the right thing at the right time. Then she wrote, in smaller letters, I will not apologize when the right thing is stupid. She closed the notebook gently, because loud in a house like theirs is a kind of vandalism, and the building hummed its evening hum and the elm did whatever trees do at midnight and her tired legs twitched as if running in place inside the dream they knew was coming. When morning arrived, it would require nothing new of her that she did not already know how to give, which might be the best a life like this could promise.",

                              "content": "Chapter Ten\n\nAugust had baked the city until the bricks gave off a kind of remembered yeast, which felt appropriate considering the venue. The converted brewery sat on the corner like a man who had gone to college and come back with new glasses; it still knew what it had been, but it wanted you to notice the polish. Inside, the air kept an echo of hops under the new smell of cable coils and coffee that had been made in a hurry. A production assistant with a ponytail like a punctuation mark handed Nell a laminate that said TALENT in a font that tried too hard to be friendly, and Ivy wore hers the way some people wear a cape, sweeping it onto her chest with the same flourish she used on a cardigan. Vera arrived with a canvas bag that thunked when it hit the floor\u2014laminated permits, a stapler that could take a finger\u2014and nodded at the rafters as if to say, I have known worse ceilings. Marta followed in a blazer that wasn\u2019t quite a blazer and a Tupperware of broccoli she had brought to bully herself, and she tucked herself against a column as if surveilling joy had always been included in her job description.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the thing that pretends not to be a circus,\u201d Ambrose said, materializing with two pens in his hair in defiance of Vera\u2019s earlier wishes and five in his pocket that made him look like a magician low on rabbits. He had added a goat sticker to his clipboard with the seriousness of a man taking the sacrament. \u201cWe are calling it a showcase because the network is allergic to the word contest unless there is confetti. This way.\u201d He did his small bounce, the one that made him look as if he had replaced bones with springs, and led them through a maze of black curtains, past a set of lights that appeared capable of tanning a mood.\n\nThe stage put its back to a wall of old copper tanks that had not been removed because history photographs well. Long tables wore fresh butcher paper and, beneath domes, the pies sat like good students trying not to attract attention. There was a mark taped on the floor at each spot like an x that spelled please do not be unpredictable. A woman with a headset and a denim jumpsuit introduced herself as Lark, showrunner, and told them the schedule the way a person tells a bedtime story to a child she does not know: soothing cadence, limited actual hope of sleep. \u201cWe\u2019ll do pre-interviews in the green room\u2014that charming term for a room that is beige\u2014then a walk-through, then we tape,\u201d she said, pointing at a whiteboard that underlined itself with its own marker. \u201cWe aim for the vibe of friendly competition. No humiliations. Try not to bleed.\u201d\n\nThe beige room tried to hold nerves and did not have enough corners to contain them. Somebody had set out a tray of vegetables like a joke and a bowl of candy like an apology. The pre-interview wall was a fake life: a plant that had never been alive, a couch that had seen a thousand brief confessions. A producer with eyebrows like question marks\u2014his name was Noah and he introduced himself with a handshake that suggested somebody had told him firm was love\u2014asked Nell to say her name for the camera and then to say it again as if she believed people were interested. He tried to coax origin myth out of her like the last bit of toothpaste, nudging the story toward fathers or accidents, toward one event that could be spooled into a neat lower-third. Nell answered in the clearest crumbs she could without agreeing to become a moral. \u201cI started as a joke,\u201d she said, and smiled without performance. \u201cIt keeps not feeling like one. I run in circles. I eat in straight lines. Both teach me where my edges are.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny rivalry we should be aware of,\u201d Noah asked, and looked down as he asked it, a trick that always made people say more than they were willing to if they thought the eyes weren\u2019t a witness. Vera\u2019s breath tightened next to her like a zipper. \u201cFriendly or otherwise. Makes for a nice package if there\u2019s someone you\u2019re chasing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI chase myself,\u201d Nell said, and it sounded pretentious in her head and fine when it hit the room. \u201cEveryone else is scenery.\u201d Ivy made a face that she believed read I am a supportive sister and actually read No packages will be made here today, and Ambrose coughed in a way that translated to we will talk later if needed because I have developed a condition called protectiveness.\n\nThey were not the only ones nervous with purpose. Ray strolled into beige with a grin that carried fifth graders on its back and stopped to clap Nell on the shoulder in that way only people who can carry kegs and grief do with the same ease. \u201cI promised the worms I\u2019d report,\u201d he said, and then leaned into the camera when Noah asked him a question and said, with enormous dignity, \u201cI teach science and I don\u2019t like bullies,\u201d which was his way of threading a needle. Tina arrived with a hoodie knotted at her waist and a look on her face like she knew she would end up hugging a stranger before the day was out. Julian appeared as if he were hoping to be mistaken for a lighting fixture, late enough to cause friction, with his cousin behind him like a shadow with agency. He wore sunglasses inside with the confidence of a person who thinks their cheekbones were grandfathered into the building code.\n\n\u201cHardwick,\u201d he said, as if the syllables tasted like a cough drop he wasn\u2019t sure was still good. \u201cNice to see your press has caught up.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy press is a goat,\u201d she said, which made Tina snort and Ray choke on his piece of carrot in a way that required thumping. Julian\u2019s cousin leaned forward just enough to register in the shot, smiled with lips and not eyes, and introduced herself as Mae. \u201cWe handle opportunities,\u201d Mae said. \u201cIf you\u2019re smart, we don\u2019t have to be enemies.\u201d Vera reached into her bag and removed the laminated sheet with regulations on health department rumor and placed it on the coffee table between the plant and a stack of coasters like a hymn.\n\nThe walk-through functioned like a rehearsal for people who refused to admit they were rehearsing. Lark went over the changes from Nell\u2019s last tent: this time there would be three rounds cut into television-friendly slices\u2014a speed round with hand pies that had been weighed within an inch of their lives to ensure fairness, a nine-inch classic for rhythm, and a \u201cregional specialty,\u201d which made Ambrose pull a face because he did not trust anything with adjectives appended by a committee. The camera operator with an old Patriots cap introduced his lens as if it were a dog that shouldn\u2019t be startled. \u201cWe\u2019re live to tape,\u201d Lark added, which meant mistakes could be edited into the illusion of grace later, and everyone unclenched a notch. The horn had been replaced by a plosive chime that someone had decided was less agricultural and more aspirational, and it made a sound like the last note of a hymn in a small church.\n\nBackstage became a city of small rituals. Marta counted Nell\u2019s sips of water in her head and tried not to be obvious about it, the same way mothers do when their children pretend at independence. She pressed a salt packet into Nell\u2019s palm like a coin at a toll booth but did not mention broccoli, because she knew when to let different vegetables have the floor. Vera set out a towel with the kind of precision that makes you think of hospitals, folded into a rectangle that had a rightness to it that even Ambrose didn\u2019t touch. Ivy rotated between hype woman and jester, telling a story about a dream in which she had switched all of Ambrose\u2019s pens for crayons and then everyone had been forced to write kinder emails. Nell found a corner where an old radiator should have been and did her little shoulder circles like a woman trying to persuade herself she deserved her own air.\n\nThey miked her up with tape that made her skin itch and the young man whose job it was to place the mic apologized with a politeness that felt like a hope for absolution in advance. \u201cSound is the only thing that always tells the truth,\u201d he said, and she thought of breath and hiccups and the ways bodies confess whether asked or not. Lark counted them down with two fingers and Nell felt the weird serene click inside herself that had turned up at Providence, an entering into the good boring that presages the moment worth spending. She rolled her wrists, held the water like it was a reasonable luxury, and looked once at the copper tanks, thinking that if you listened hard enough you could hear the old yeast cheering for anyone who did their job on time.\n\nThe hand pies were first and they were wicked little things, designed to deceive a mouth that sought security in routine. The pastry flaked wrong if you went at it with hunger, and the filling behaved like cunning under pressure. Nell found a rhythm that worked in miniature: two bites per pie, a sip every four, a breath through her nose that let her pretend she hadn\u2019t become a circus for twelve minutes. Julian went hard as if gentleness insulted him, and the camera loved him for it because cameras always love boys who look like they might insult a pastry on principle. Tina did her steady miracle and did not get blueberry on her knuckles, which was as much art as running a clean curve. Ray waggled his eyebrows at a child and then ate three in a row so quickly Ambrose made a noise that sounded like a pen breaking.\n\nThe classic nine-inchers came out, apple first as if to reassure the part of the room that believed in tradition, and Nell put her brain back on its leash. Lark\u2019s voice floated over the talkback in a calm that would have soothed misbehaving toddlers, and the chime sounded again and the tables tipped forward and time did its rubber band trick. Nell cut the first wedge with her mouth and thought, absurdly, of the hill in Providence, as if the body kept files that it could reorganize by category: here is endurance in the leg, and here is endurance in the jaw. She was careful on the blue because old syrup had longer arms than anyone admits. She watched the steam behave and counted the corners like landmarks\u2014corner seams, inhale, press, swallow\u2014and promised her stomach she would speak to it gently later when it sent up a memo with the subject line we are not amused. Julian tried his tilt trick and a blueberry escaped his jurisdiction just long enough for camera two to catch it committing minor treason on the butcher paper, and Ambrose\u2019s eyebrows, from the wings, achieved the highest point of their day.\n\nIt was when the \u201cregional specialty\u201d arrived that the gods of television remembered their duty to chaos. Lark had chosen, for reasons that would be argued in kitchens and group texts for a week, a cranberry-streusel with a crust that had something like a personality. It cracked when you looked at it and sighed when you did not. The first bite was forgiveness and the second tried to call your bluff. Nell adjusted to small bites because cranberries want to own your vowel sounds, and let the water take its share without handing over the keys. A light fizzed and popped in the rig above them with a drama that did not affect the shot but required a man with a ladder and a calm face, and while he dealt with his electricity like a therapist with a sense of humor, someone in the third row decided to be helpful and called, \u201cEat!\u201d in a cadence that was all wrong. Ivy made her own rhythm louder than a chant by tapping the palm of her hand on her thigh in the beat Nell had trained herself to love, and the sound cut through the clang of nerves better than the chime.\n\nJulian made his play somewhere in the sixth minute, not with elbows\u2014he was not that foolish with six cameras watching\u2014but with his proximity, edging his plate as if the table belonged to a man who had been taught property at a particular school. He said, conversationally, \u201cIt\u2019s television, you know,\u201d and the stress on the wrong syllable turned television into a warning. Nell did not turn her head because she wanted to keep her neck for a day when her neck would affect an outcome. She put a wedge of cranberry down with the dignity of someone putting a poor conversationalist in a taxi and thought about the copper tank behind her, which had held fermentation without boasting. Vera\u2019s eyes on the side of her face felt like a stiffness you learn to be grateful for where steel holds you up.\n\nThe hiccup arrived like it had been invited by the chime, and it did its small hook at the diaphragm that wanted to write her headline for her: runner ruined by burp, a sentence that would please nobody who loved her. She did what she had been taught, tongue to palate, breath to lower back, jaw gentled like a horse made skittish by bad hands. It went away with a sulk and she kept the wheel straight even as the road tried to slope. She thought of Mrs. Dalrymple\u2019s moons and a goat with a medal and her mother salting a lemon with a certainty that kept the world upright. The cranberry on her teeth tasted like the kind of honesty that stings a little but leaves you clean.\n\nTime did the thing where it announced itself with no precision and then became precise all at once. Lark put up a hand behind the cameras, the chime behaved, and Ambrose did his hawk eyes down the line like a parishioner counting hymnal dents. Plates hit the paper with an almost sexual relief. The applause had the odd weight of a sound designed later to become branding. Lark stepped forward into frame with the composure of a priest in a vest that's a little too shiny and did her summary in a voice that made all of them sound like old friends at a reunion even though some of them had anonymously emailed the health department about each other.\n\nThey counted. Tina had eight and change and shrugged as if to say, I am already proud of the thing that was steady. Ray had ten precise and pointed at a fifth grader in the front row who had smuggled in a worm in a pocket, and the kid did an unlicensed dance. Julian had nine and a sliver he tried to argue into a third with a smile that had gotten him his way elsewhere; Ambrose did a gentle no with his head and his pen at the same time, and Mae pressed her lips together like someone putting a stamp on a letter that would not get answered. Nell had nine and three quarters and a smear of cranberry on her lower lip that would become someone\u2019s screenshot by evening, and when Ambrose announced it, he followed the words, reflexively now, with that tiny knuckle tap to the plate that meant I see the work, which in this building felt like sacrament.\n\nLark declared her the day\u2019s \u201cfeature,\u201d a word that swallowed and spat out the idea of first and made it into content, and the crowd did the noise that television likes because it sounds like redemption even when it is just the release of tension. Tina whooped, delighted in a way that doubled as relief, and Ray put both hands in the air like a referee who has decided to be generous. Julian applauded at a volume his rings could flatter and smiled the half smile he used when saving his whole one for a different room, and Mae adjusted his sleeve like that would smooth the world. Nell felt the ribbon around her neck like a light coin and had the absurd thought, toward the copper, that the old yeast approved of her restraint.\n\nPostgame was always payday for people who don\u2019t like to miss anything. Noah perched on the edge of the beige couch and asked her how much of it was luck, as if luck were a measurement you could pour into a cup. She said the thing she\u2019d learned herself into: it was always luck, and training made it so you deserved it when it arrived. He asked if today made her feel brave, and she said bravery was for actual danger; she was practicing sincerity in ridiculous situations. He asked\u2014softly, as if his voice could get hurt if he pushed it\u2014if there had been a moment where she wanted to quit and she loved him for asking without wanting her to cry on the couch for it. \u201cI wanted to stop every second between three minutes and seven,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I got bored, and boredom is where my body thinks I\u2019m safe.\u201d\n\nOutside, the sky had chosen that industrial blue that cities do best at seven, and the old brick looked yesterday and tomorrow at once. Marta put her hand on Nell\u2019s back in a way that said, doctor\u2019s tears, not coach\u2019s, and gave her an instruction with exactly five words, which had become their ritual: \u201cEat. Complaint later. Shoes off.\u201d Vera stood opposite Lark with her laminate held like a weapon, politely declining a request for \u201ca quick shot in the kitchen\u201d with a speech that began, \u201cThis is not your room,\u201d and ended with, \u201cUnless you\u2019re bleaching the corner, I am busy,\u201d and Lark laughed at herself because she was a person who was learning which nos were yeses to bigger things. Ivy wore two laminates now, one stolen, one given, and she used them to direct traffic as if the job had been invented for her. Ambrose counted his pens and found one on the floor by a coil and looked at it with enough affection to embarrass himself if anyone had noticed.\n\nThey spent their prize money and their adrenaline at a diner two blocks over that had pretended not to redecorate for forty years. The waitress had a voice that could fold a person and she recognized tired on sight, and when she asked what they wanted Ivy said, \u201cYour opinion,\u201d and the woman brought them pancakes and eggs and a piece of pie that Vera permitted like a benevolent monarch. They ate without needing to narrate because each of them owned the same movie and did not require a different angle. The plate squares and the sugar caddy and the sound of silverware doing its small violence brought Nell down into the earth of her own body where awards do not matter and salt does.\n\nWhen they returned to Stoughton, someone had chalked a crooked heart on the sidewalk by the elm and written under it, you live here, which was either nothing or everything. The anonymous pests tried one more time before midnight with a message that said, you are too much, and Ivy took the phone from Nell\u2019s hand and put it on the counter face down like a frog and wrote under a magnet, we are exactly as much as we say, and then she went to brush her teeth with the pomp of a person closing a day properly. Ray texted a photo of a worm habitat in a plastic bin with the caption, They prefer darkness and steady noise, which felt like a metaphor everyone in the room enjoyed too much. Tina sent a picture of her using a bag of frozen peas on her knee with a middle finger faced inward to the part of her that still believed suffering had to be public. Ambrose wrote, Goat pleased, and attached a sketch he had done in biro on a napkin of a goat in a cardigan, and Vera replied with a picture of the broom leaned sweeter than yesterday.\n\nAt the edge of sleep, with her windows open to a night that smelled like the blacktop had finally calmed down, Nell thought about the copper tanks and the way the sound in that room had risen and settled like a boil. She thought about Julian\u2019s half-smile and let it be a footnote, not a headline, and about Mae\u2019s sleeve-tugs, and about Lark\u2019s default kindness, which had been purpose and not posture. She thought about the way Marta had not said proud out loud because proud can be a fragile thing when handled wrong, and how Vera had made a boundary sound like a lullaby, and how Ivy had stolen a laminate as if legitimacy were a physical object you could pocket if you were fast. She wrote in her notebook one sentence that would embarrass her tomorrow and feel true all the same: Today I refused to be simplified at scale. Then she added, in smaller letters, Remember to buy lemons, and closed the book with a care that felt like respect. The building made its sleeve-sound, the elm negotiated with the air, and some part of her that had needed attention settled down like an animal that had been fed and believed the next meal would come.",
