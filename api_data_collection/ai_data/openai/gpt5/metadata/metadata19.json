     "novel_text": "Bart ran down King Street before the sun knew it was late. The Ion slid past like a thought he couldn\u2019t hold, windows full of bleary faces and the ghost of yesterday\u2019s rain. He had a rule about mornings: if he beat the buses out, if his laces were tied before the baker on Duke flicked on his orange lamps, he could pretend the city was his to move through, not something pressing down on him. The air smelled like wet brick and coffee. It would be a good day for his legs, he told them, even though they didn\u2019t talk back and he would\u2019ve been worried if they did.\n\nHe cut down toward Victoria Park, skirting the geese with the caution of a man who\u2019s learned that geese have no respect for athletes, Canadian or not. The path slicked under his shoes, that whisper of rubber on damp stone that could make a body feel fast without actually being fast. He liked that lie. He ran toward the bandstand and then out toward the bridge, counting river lamps because numbers didn\u2019t argue. One-two-three-four, flicker, five-six.\n\nCoach Rinaldi said the mornings were for base mileage, his gravel voice making mileage sound like something you poured into a tank. \u201cYou can\u2019t sprint on empties,\u201d Rinaldi liked to say, and then he would drink his coffee like he\u2019d said something new this time, and Bart would nod because people should be allowed to enjoy their old lines. He\u2019d been nodding since he was ten, since the first time he ran a charity 5K and felt like his lungs had learned a word he wasn\u2019t ready to say out loud.\n\nThe city never left him alone. Not entirely. It snagged at his shorts in the form of rambunctious dogs, it tugged at his ear with the bells on streetcars that weren\u2019t technically streetcars. It whispered to him on the backs of benches: City of Kitchener Summer Events\u2014Live at the Square every Friday. He had grown up in the shadow of big hockey. The Rangers\u2019 jerseys hung in the windows of pubs and dentists alike. His father, Ben, had a 1990s poster of a goalie masked in his living room, his personal religious icon. But Bart had barely learned to skate. He\u2019d found his own arena, with lane lines painted on it and coaches who told you your worth in intervals.\n\n\u201cBack before sunrise, Bart?\u201d A runner he knew from the club raised a hand and then vanished into the trees. The city ate people like that.\n\nBack home, his apartment over the noodle shop smelled of broth no one asked him to cook. Fresh posters of the Athletics Ontario circuit were taped on the wall, curling at the edges like they were trying to wave. The top one was a meet flyer: Guelph Alumni Stadium, Mid-Spring 1500m Classic, a petty little name for a petty little field that seemed to include every man who\u2019d beaten him by half a step since high school. A bold-font face stared from the lower right: Rowan Keane, defending champion. A collection of pixels that somehow made a mouth he already hated and eyes he pretended not to register.\n\nHe\u2019d known Rowan\u2019s name too long to forget it the way he forgot other athletes\u2019 names. At first it had just been a shape in the results. K. Keane (GUEL) 3:42.89. Later it was a shoulder ahead of him at the bell, an elbow that did not forgive and did not forget. Rinaldi called Rowan \u201cthe exact measure of where you need to be,\u201d like the man was a ruler, a totem, a stick with notches. Bart called him something else in his head, something ruder and shorter and made of syllables that felt like punching a wall. Arch enemy fell out of his mouth once, as a joke, and Tess, his sister, had laughed too hard and then looked more closely than he liked. \u201cArch, like you\u2019re in a comic book,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cDo you have a cape? Spikes aren\u2019t capes, buddy.\u201d\n\nNow, showered and fed because he did the basic things to keep alive, he stood in front of the flyer and dared the paper to scare him. His phone vibrated on the counter.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d Tess said without hello. He pictured her in the kitchen of their parents\u2019 house, a smear of jam on her elbow, a plant growing too well in the background. Twenty-two, opinionated as a cat.\n\n\u201cWhat gave it away,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sun or the sweating?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re running out of jokes. Mom wants to know if you\u2019re coming for dinner. Wednesday. Dad\u2019s on his chili.\u201d A pause. \u201cAlso, I saw a thing about Rowan on the University\u2019s page. He\u2019s doing some\u2014like a community clinic? Signing autographs. He\u2019s got a\u2026 hair situation now. Too branded.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about his hair,\u201d Bart said immediately, and then: \u201cWhat clinic?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing when you get coy. Hey, I gotta go. Tell coach R to hydrate. You know how he gets that prune look.\u201d\n\nAs if echo, he looked at his own face in the kettle\u2019s curve. A blur that looked awake and tired and something in between. He named the things he would do. He would run the morning mileage. He would go to his shift at the warehouse on Shirley, stacking boxes that politely suggested they had souls. He would stop on the way back to pick up new tape because his right ankle had decided to remember January\u2019s sprain. He would not look too long at Rowan\u2019s picture, and he would not google the words \u201cRowan Keane clinic Kitchener Guelph rivalry\u201d because that was beneath him. That\u2019s what he told himself, but then his thumb was already walking across the letters.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t in Kitchener. It was in Guelph, alumni stadium, Saturday morning, an hour after the junior heats. A meet plus clinic, to bring the community in. He imagined a little Rowan on a folding chair talking to kids, sealing their dreams with a pen. He closed the tab. He opened it again. He closed it finally and laughed aloud at nothing, at a ceiling he knew by heart.\n\nRinaldi had texted at 5:30 a.m. like always. \u201cTwo by six by four hundred. Short rec. Put the watch away. Listen.\u201d On the track, listening is a talent. Bart thought he had it. Not like music. Like hearing the softness of your footfalls and knowing when you\u2019re lying to yourself about how hard you\u2019re pushing.\n\nHe got to the track when the student joggers cleared. It wasn\u2019t his, it was a community oval half a mile from his apartment, a rough red ring. Rinaldi was already there in a coat too big for a man who\u2019d never grown into it. He wore the coat year-round. Maybe it had a heart inside it he needed to keep warm.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d Rinaldi said, as if stating the facts might keep them on his side.\n\n\u201cI tried leaving, but the path turned into a treadmill,\u201d Bart said. \u201cMagic.\u201d\n\nRinaldi\u2019s smile was a sidelong thing. \u201cGood. Warm up.\u201d Then, later: \u201cThe Guelph meet. Obviously. I signed you up.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Bart said, pretending the word did not mean I have been thinking of nothing else for days.\n\n\u201cAnd you won\u2019t get distracted by that boy\u2019s theatrics?\u201d\n\nBart shook out his legs. \u201cYou\u2019ll be pleased to know I am a man of iron focus.\u201d He lifted his knees. \u201cI do not know who or what you are talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeane. You two make every race look like a bank robbery.\u201d Rinaldi squinted past him, to where the short hurdle carts were sleeping. \u201cHe runs the way geese fight. All noise and then suddenly teeth. Don\u2019t watch him. Make him watch you.\u201d\n\nAnd in some unkind corner of himself, Bart said, Make him watch me even when he doesn\u2019t want to.\n\nThe reps went. The first set felt like the opening of a doorway on a day you didn\u2019t trust it to open. The second was a bench you couldn\u2019t choose, either splinters or cold metal. He finished every four hundred like he could swallow the air and it would save him. Rinaldi clapped quietly, the sound of small thunder.\n\n\u201c3:42 needs 60s,\u201d the coach said, an equation like a prayer. \u201cYou can touch that if you stop hating your last two steps. You have a memory like a dog, kid. You keep going back to the place that hurt you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not hate,\u201d Bart told him, lying because sometimes you have to put salt on the morning.\n\nAfter, he collapsed against the fence and let the winter-spring sun do its insufficient best. He watched a teenager skip the last forty meters of her own rep and sulk when her coach noticed. The place swarmed with stories and he could hear them if he wanted. He was not in any of them. Not yet, not in the kind of way that stuck.\n\nHe went to the warehouse and lived the neat version of himself there. He navigated between stacks that rattled when he touched them. His supervisor, a woman named Monique with purple glasses and arms that looked carved from stair rails, said, \u201cYou look pale today. You need a pastry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to stop running,\u201d he returned automatically, and they both laughed because they loved the lie, it made them feel like regular people.\n\nDuring lunch he ate without tasting. A coworker scrolled through his phone at the same table, video sound too loud until someone told him to stop. The phone showed Rowan being Rowan, half an interview in a locker room that wasn\u2019t technically a locker room. \u201cWhat\u2019s your mindset for the season?\u201d a reporter asked. \u201cFast,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cFaster.\u201d The camera caught his mouth in the act of conceding nothing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty,\u201d Monique said, casual, not knowing any of the blood under Bart\u2019s skin. \u201cLike an arrow. I like arrows. They get to the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t start,\u201d Bart muttered, but he watched the video anyway, because there are dances your mind leads you into even as you say no no no.\n\nBy Thursday, the wind was full of intentions, biting and soft. He stopped in at the coffee place on his corner\u2014Barker & Grain, chalkboard specials, the same barista who always pretended the beans had something to say about life. She wore a beanie and a scowl and she liked Bart better when he sweated. Today he was in the no-man\u2019s-land between. He asked for a long black. She gave him a short one and a grin like they were sharing a joke about the definition of long.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to Guelph, right,\u201d she said, not a question.\n\n\u201cGood to see I have no privacy within a two-kilometer radius of my house,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNone. If you win, we put a picture of you up next to the latte art failures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are sacred.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen run sacred. Also\u2014watch the intersection at Gaukel,\u201d she said, an odd non sequitur. \u201cThey did something to the lights. It\u2019s like chaos threw up down there.\u201d\n\nHe blinked. \u201cIs that your way of keeping me alive?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone has to. You look like a person who would get absorbed into a red hand and not notice.\u201d\n\nHe went. He didn\u2019t get hit by anything that morning. The light at Gaukel did not eat him. If it had, maybe the world would have rearranged itself in a more comprehensible way. It didn\u2019t. He ran. He went back to work. He ate his mother\u2019s chili that evening and told his father yes, he\u2019d sit through the second period of the game, yes, he\u2019d cheer for the home team, no, he would not admit the ref was biased. After nine, he stood in front of the downstairs bathroom mirror and watched the steam gather on the edges of his face. It made the world a little kinder. He wiped a path through.\n\nOn Friday, the last day before the clash he wouldn\u2019t call a clash, he jogged it out and pretended the track was a place where nothing changed. Rinaldi stood by the start line like a statue erected to stubbornness.\n\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d Rinaldi asked.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie so much you start believing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bart said again, because he didn\u2019t know another answer.\n\nHe saw him first on the warm-up loop. Guelph\u2019s Alumni Stadium was a bowl with aspirations, bleachers that had been promised more backs than they got. The turf glowed unnaturally, a green that didn\u2019t exist in nature but was voted least irritating by a committee. The sky held its own breath. Athletes milled. The scent of Tiger Balm was stronger than religion.\n\nRowan came down the back stretch with a loose-limbed, we-are-all-fine trot. He was easy to recognize even if you wished otherwise. Something about the economy of him. The way he ran like the world was an argument he had already won. He had that hair Tess had mocked\u2014rumpled but styled to look like he hadn\u2019t tried, a glass of water pretending it had never been poured.\n\nBart didn\u2019t look. Or he did, in the way you look at a lit window when you\u2019re walking past. He noted the sinew of underarms, the particular city of shin. He let the data pass through him as if that would make it harmless.\n\nThey mingled. They stretched in their own corners. The announcer made noises into the mic as if it were a reluctant animal. The junior heats were finishing and the kids ran with faces that would be photographs later. Some of them wore their school sweaters to warm up. Some of them more talent than sense. Bart sat on the cool rubber and tugged at his laces, pulling them tight and then tighter, a ritual of control.\n\n\u201cKW Flyers,\u201d a voice said above his shoulder. It carried a smile you couldn\u2019t see. \u201cIs that still a bird or did you all change it to a lightning bolt when I wasn\u2019t looking?\u201d\n\nHe knew the voice before he even had to raise his head. He turned as if the motion had weight to it and found Rowan standing not quite too close, chewing a piece of gum like a man with nothing to prove to gum. His eyes were green that day, or they were brown pretending green. They did that. Faces were liars. He was taller than the rumor of him and softer, somehow, and not soft at all.\n\n\u201cStill a bird,\u201d Bart said. \u201cWe try not to let branding change us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d Rowan said, and laughed at himself, which threw Bart\u2019s heart out of step for a second. \u201cKeane,\u201d he added, as if there could be doubt. He stuck out a hand, mock-polite. Bart stared at it longer than necessary and shook. Touch like a live wire you weren\u2019t sure you could let go of without pretending it hadn\u2019t hurt.\n\n\u201cBart,\u201d he said, because he forgot to say his last name sometimes, because he wanted to believe the rest of him was implied.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Rowan said. The words came too easily. \u201cYou cut down too fast from six hundred in Sudbury last month. Rinaldi teach you that? He\u2019s always liked tricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your coach likes\u2014what? Majesty?\u201d\n\n\u201cMisery,\u201d Rowan said, not even blinking. \u201cBut the nice kind.\u201d\n\nThey could have left it there. They didn\u2019t. They looked at each other like the whole stadium had narrowed to a point between them. The noise of beeps and whistles slid off. Rowan\u2019s lip did a thing that had probably sold many, many shoes.\n\n\u201cI like your form,\u201d Rowan said, surprising the lie right out of Bart\u2019s throat.\n\n\u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clean. It makes me nervous,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cSometimes, not always. Don\u2019t let that go to your head. But it\u2019s like the clear part of a river that just turns into rocks with no warning. I like that. Secret violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour compliments are weird,\u201d Bart said, and found himself smiling, real as the cold.\n\n\u201cYour elbows are weirder,\u201d Rowan returned. \u201cHey. Good luck today.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend to be nice. It doesn\u2019t fit you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what fits me.\u201d Rowan paused, and something passed between them that had nothing to do with spikes or laps. \u201cYet.\u201d\n\nBart stared after him when he went. He made himself stop. He went through the last drills by the book. A-skips, B-skips, high knees, butt kicks, the little show your body performs to convince itself it can do this again. The starters called them to the line. Fourteen men with the same intention, wearing different faces. Bart felt the track collect under his feet like a promise. Rowan took the inside. Bart had lane three but he told himself that wasn\u2019t symbolic. He did not live in symbols. He lived in flesh and heartbeats.\n\nThe gun did not sound like war. It sounded like the day being split.\n\nFirst lap: caution, the accord of the field finding its groove. He smelled sweat and fear and the peppermint someone had forgotten to swallow. He had a plan. He would sit two back and then float. He would not chase. He would not let the race become something other people did to him.\n\nNine hundred: the world narrowed. He heard Rinaldi\u2019s voice, not words, just the shape of that gravel. He heard his own breath, louder than he wanted. He saw the back of Rowan\u2019s jersey and the cut from a number pin and wanted to put his fingers there. He wanted to take the bit in his mouth and run.\n\nBell: the bell. A thin brass circle that reduced men. He had the kick or he didn\u2019t. He went. He did not listen to anything that told him to wait. He moved to shoulder, then shoulder again, then his hand brushed Rowan\u2019s hand and it might have been an accident. It wasn\u2019t. They were alive in the way you get to be once or twice in a month if you\u2019re lucky.\n\nOne hundred to go: the mind begins to lie. It tells you what you deserve and what you don\u2019t. Bart\u2019s knees came up like he\u2019d always been running on his toes, like he had been ready for this without knowing. Rowan\u2019s breath was a noise. The line loomed stupid and huge and then they were there, throwing themselves at it like people do at gods.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t know in the first second after the line. He stumbled and caught himself on his hands and then Rinaldi was pounding him on the back and the announcer mispronounced his last name and then got it right and then he knew. He had won. He had beat Rowan by a thing smaller than the amount of faith he usually optimistically put aside, but he had beat him.\n\nThe wild thing wasn\u2019t the winning. The wild thing was Rowan\u2019s face when they were both back on two feet. He expected knives. He expected a thrown elbow without the deniability of the pack. He got instead something that looked like relief and then a twist of something like, approximating, almost\u2026 pride?\n\n\u201cYou took it,\u201d Rowan said, voice rougher than his hair. \u201cYou actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bart said. His chest was breaking in and out like a house in wind. \u201cYou didn\u2019t let me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I did,\u201d Rowan shot back, but it landed without malice. \u201cDon\u2019t make a habit.\u201d\n\nBart wanted to say something generous. Or cruel. Or both. Instead, he said, \u201cAre you doing your clinic after this?\u201d\n\nRowan blinked at him, thrown sideways by the pivot. \u201cYeah. Why.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause\u2026,\u201d Bart began, and didn\u2019t know the end of his sentence. \u201cBecause I want to watch how you talk to kids like you were never one.\u201d\n\nRowan\u2019s laugh startled them both. \u201cStay. If Rinaldi doesn\u2019t tie you to a post and make you jog for forty more minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if he does.\u201d\n\nThey stood there in the heap of their exhaustion and looked at each other as if they were studying a language that was not spoken lines on a page but the way someone tilted their chin, the way sweat carved a map. He could have touched Rowan again, for scientific reasons. He did not. Rinaldi called, and Rowan lifted his hand like a boy at a window and walked away.\n\nAfter the cool-down\u2014which Bart performed like a man pretending to be a runner in a play\u2014he stood by the chain-link and watched the clinic begin. The kids sat, cross-legged, a sprawl of bright shoes. Rowan perched on the edge of a high jump mat and spoke with a kind of lightness Bart had never seen in him. He told them about patience, which seemed unfair and a little funny. He told them about running ugly when you had to, about the art in ugly, about not waiting for the perfect day because it had other plans. He made a kid laugh. He made a parent lean in. He looked up once, and his gaze found Bart through the fence like it knew where he was when he was anywhere.\n\n\u201cDo you want to get coffee?\u201d The words were in Bart\u2019s mouth before he wanted them there. He waited until Rowan wasn\u2019t being watched by small humans. He waited and then the waiting hurt too much.\n\nRowan glanced at the time, as if his body kept one. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to,\u201d he said, a little rueful. \u201cBut I want to.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t happen then, because people wanted to take pictures, and a grandmother introduced Rowan to a grandson as if she were presenting the boy to a medium and asking for a future not too cruel. It happened an hour later, at a terrible caf\u00e9 near campus with low ceilings and high prices, where the barista wrote Rowan\u2019s name on a cup like a curse and spelled it wrong anyway. They sat, two men who had tried to take each other apart by inches, and sipped coffee that tried to take them apart from the inside.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not what I thought,\u201d Bart said eventually, when he\u2019d run out of lines to rehearse.\n\n\u201cWho were you practicing me as?\u201d Rowan asked.\n\n\u201cYou know. The enemy.\u201d\n\nRowan considered his cup as if it might give him a line. \u201cI\u2019ve never been anyone\u2019s enemy,\u201d he said eventually, and the lie was small but dense. \u201cUnless I have. You\u2019ve been in my way for years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the same as knowing me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think you could?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I already do,\u201d Bart lied, because it would be the worst thing to admit that he was already lost in the outline of a jaw.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Rowan said, and pointed at him with the corner of his lid, \u201care trouble. You feel like a bad decision I want to make.\u201d\n\nIt felt like being picked out of a line. It felt like the warm part in a cold room. If a person can be velocity, that\u2019s what Rowan was across the table, that hum of effort even when sitting absolutely still. Bart found himself listing the things that made him a human being\u2014childhood bedroom with dinosaur wallpaper beneath teen posters, the dog he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring to races, the scar on his calf from the first time he thought he could hurdle\u2014and none of it mattered as much as the way Rowan watched him, the friendly murder in it.\n\nThey walked back to the car park like a joke about normal people. Bart\u2019s little ten-year hatchback with the back seat that whistled. Rowan\u2019s slightly flashier, unexpectedly modest black sedan that didn\u2019t say anything. They stood there in a square of shade and the city moved around them and nobody knew them. Then Rowan stepped in, and everything fell a notch closer.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Rowan said at the last second, before anything had even happened. \u201cI can\u2019t do\u2014this. I have to go. I want to. It\u2019s just.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to go,\u201d Bart said, relieved and scorched at once. \u201cI get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to win,\u201d Rowan said, and then made a face that was half apology. \u201cYou do something to my head that I don\u2019t entirely\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSame,\u201d Bart returned. \u201cWhich is inconvenient.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can be inconvenient later,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cWe have tomorrow. Or the day after. Don\u2019t mess up your recovery. Don\u2019t hate me if I do a job on you next time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Bart lied. \u201cMaybe. Probably.\u201d\n\nRowan\u2019s hand hovered and then fell. He stepped back, half a foot, a full story. \u201cGo home,\u201d he told Bart softly. \u201cBe careful at those stupid lights.\u201d\n\nHe left with his stride that went through walls. Bart stood by his hatchback and watched him go and hated him, a little. Loved him, a little. Kept his hands to himself because the air was the only thing in reach. He went home to Kitchener in the grey hour where the highway felt like one long apology. The radio announced weather where there wasn\u2019t any worth announcing. A billboard told him to sign up for something that would improve his life by twenty-nine percent. He could feel the shape of Rowan\u2019s absence in the car like a third seat.\n\nAt home, the noodle shop sent up a steam prayer. He set his bag down like he was someone who didn\u2019t want it to fall. He showered like a human being pretending to be better than an animal and made eggs that tasted like triumph with an aftertaste of salt he hadn\u2019t put in. He texted Tess a sandblasted picture of the finish with a caption that read: 3:42.61. She sent back seventeen emojis that did not include the right one. He texted Rinaldi a single thumbs-up because that was their love language. He did not text Rowan, because he did not have Rowan\u2019s number. He did not have anything but the knowing and the wanting and the way his chest flickered like a light at the end of its cord.\n\nLater, after the longer hum of the city\u2019s Saturday night had dimmed, he stood by the window and watched himself reflected in the darkness. He tried to imagine explaining this to himself in language that wouldn\u2019t make him blush. He could not. He slept badly and woke early, which was his trick.\n\nHe returned to the rhythm. He went to work and stacked boxes and thought of nothing. He ran on trails he could map in his sleep and this time he kept his eyes where they were supposed to be. He had told himself his life would not be changed by winning once. He had told himself that about other things and had been wrong before. He went to a Sunday market with Tess and pretended to consider a handmade wooden spoon with the concentration of a surgeon.\n\n\u201cStop staring into space,\u201d she said, and pressed a rind of cheese to his lips. \u201cEat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d he said, around the rind. \u201cI have been. I will.\u201d He loved Tess best when she bossed him. He loved her less when she said, too knowing, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go and make google eyes at your arch nemesis, at least try to protect your heart a little? I like it. It\u2019s not a toy.\u201d\n\nHe made a face, because that was their other language. \u201cHe\u2019s not my enemy. He\u2019s just\u2014a person. Who has a certain way of moving. That makes a person curious.\u201d\n\n\u201cA certain way of moving,\u201d she repeated, delighted and cruel. \u201cGross. Do you want me to leave you alone with the concept of shoulders?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me five minutes.\u201d\n\nHe waited for the ground to change its tilt. He waited for the world to reveal the trick, or a trapdoor. Instead: Monday. Then Tuesday. Rowan existed in his phone in the places that were supposed to be for news. Rinaldi looked at him like he didn\u2019t trust how light Bart\u2019s steps were, as if he would float away and stop doing the beast work of running. The lights at Gaukel stayed weird, but he learned them.\n\nWednesday he walked to work past the bookstore that pretended it didn\u2019t sell only gifts, and saw a thin newspaper folded into the rack. A photo he recognized. Rowan at an awards dinner wearing a suit like someone else had arranged it on him. He didn\u2019t buy the paper. He stood and read the caption like a thief and then moved on, his heart a smaller thing.\n\nIn the nights after, he dreamt sometimes about the last hundred meters and sometimes about a parking lot. That these dreams were equally vivid unnerved him. He had always had the kind of brain that resisted softness. That was not true anymore. He stopped trying to make it true. He let his legs do that instead.\n\nWhen Rowan finally texted, because somehow of course he did, it was a number without a name. \u201cYou left your throat on the track,\u201d the message read. \u201cWant to grab it back?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is this,\u201d Bart typed, and then deleted it. \u201cWhere, when,\u201d he sent instead.\n\n\u201cWhere: Country Boy Eatery, by the highway. When: now-ish,\u201d came back. \u201cIf you\u2019re not there in twelve minutes I will say hateful things about you to the sugar packets.\u201d\n\nBart didn\u2019t tell Rinaldi. He told Tess, who texted: \u201cBring an umbrella, it\u2019s a weather day.\u201d He took his keys and left. He told himself it was just pancakes and mocking. It was, and then it wasn\u2019t. Country Boy was a place with sticky tables and the best kind of waitresses, the kind who could flip you onto your back with one eyebrow. Rowan had a booth at the back and was flipping a spoon like it had offended him. He saw Bart and his face did that lifting, that uncoiling that made another face inside it.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d Bart echoed, and it was both the first time and not even close.\n\nThey talked nonsense first. The food was deeply acceptable. Rowan made a pitch for the sanctity of bad coffee. Bart argued for eggs as religion. The waitress rolled her eyes and called them children. Their knees touched under the table by accident, then on purpose. They argued about form again. They argued about music. They found the rhythm of interrupting and not minding and then giving the floor back because it felt good to let the other person be smart. When he left, Rowan bumped his shoulder against Bart\u2019s in the parking lot like it was a sentence. He didn\u2019t end the sentence. He let it hang until the next day, and then again.\n\nThey made small allowances. They did not tell anyone who would understand too quickly. They kept to public places that felt private and to private places that they kept quiet. In the grocery store aisle on a Thursday night, Rowan picked up a can of tomatoes and read the label like it contained an escape route. \u201cI have to leave early Saturday,\u201d he said. \u201cCoach wants me at a road thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo don\u2019t come Friday,\u201d Bart said, back turned, like he could twist the burn into a stretch. He replaced a jar he didn\u2019t want. He overthought the peanut butter.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cI\u2019m coming Friday. I am not available to be rational on the subject of you.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, they kissed in the shadow of a tiny bridge in Victoria Park because it was the only place that felt like it could hold a beginning. Birdsound. Rubber on stone. A child\u2019s bicycle tossed aside. People not noticing because why would they. Rowan tasted like snowmelt and sugar. Or maybe that\u2019s not right. Maybe he tasted like the pause between pronouncing a sentence and understanding it. Bart stepped back because if he hadn\u2019t he would have fallen in.\n\nHe did not say love. He did not say anything believable. He said, \u201cAgain,\u201d and again happened, and then they walked separate ways because life remained a wide and complicated road and they had other obligations, sleepy ones, sharp ones. But his stomach was a wing. The city looked briefly like it had put on a new coat. Even the geese bowed, almost.\n\nOn Sunday, he brought Rowan to see Tess and the dog by accident, by not-checking, by wanting something, by a dozen small rebellions. Tess looked at Rowan like she was tasting water she didn\u2019t trust. Then she smiled and shook his hand, and the dog adored him instantly, which meant nothing and everything.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who runs like you\u2019re about to commit a crime,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGuilty,\u201d Rowan responded, a little shy, and that was a thing to put in a jar and keep for later.\n\nIt would have been easy, if anything in the world was. It would have been a path with firm little posts at the side, bolts in, caution, guardrail. Instead it was a tightrope stretched across days. Perfect for a runner, you might say. No. After a while you want ground. You want it to hold.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rowan canceled. On Wednesday it rained and Bart ran anyway, though his ankle nagged him with a voice he recognized. On Thursday, Rowan sent a photo of a plane wing and a thumbs-up. On Friday, Bart walked to Gaukel and did not look at the crosswalk any differently. On Saturday, the phone call came mid-morning, Rinaldi\u2019s name on the screen, which was odd. Rinaldi didn\u2019t call mid-morning. No one did, except maybe your kid or the bank.\n\n\u201cYou should turn on the news,\u201d Rinaldi said, his voice sand and smoke. \u201cYou should\u2014no, wait. Don\u2019t turn on the news. Tess is\u2014she\u2019s okay. She\u2019s okay. It wasn\u2019t here. It was in Guelph. A car. A child. He\u2014Keane. The boy. He didn\u2019t. It was an intersection. He. It was an accident, Bart. It was\u2014it was everything nobody deserved. They\u2019re saying. He\u2019s\u2014he\u2014\u201d\n\nBart stood, listening while Rinaldi tried to find a sentence that let everyone remain standing. He made out three facts and a hundred terrible shadows. Car. Child. Rowan. Accident. The words rattled and then swallowed themselves. The kettle in the kitchen had forgotten to boil and was trying again. The window held his reflection and below it the street. He could see the crosswalk down there, the place where the red hand had looked too much like a dare the other day. He could see the city, unchanged. He could not hear his breath.\n\n\u201cBart?\u201d Rinaldi said. It was a hard question. \u201cBart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said, and the words did not fit in his mouth the way they used to.\n\nThe kettle clicked off. The world did not. He took the phone to his ear with both hands. He listened while Rinaldi gave him the facts again, because facts are all you have when you don\u2019t have anything else.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to him,\u201d Bart said, without knowing if he could, if he should, if the doors of the world would let him through.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s\u2014if he even wants\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t want anything right now,\u201d Bart said. \u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d He laughed, a terrible small laugh that made the room colder. \u201cThat\u2019s all I have. Wanting nothing.\u201d\n\nHe put on his shoes without tying them properly and tied them. He remembered his keys this time. He left the house and the noodle smell and the poster curling on the wall and walked into a day that had every intention of continuing without him. He did not know where to go. He went anyway.He drove to Guelph without fully remembering how the decision turned into keys, how keys turned into ignition, how ignition turned into the same two lanes he always took when he needed a change of scenery that looked like the last one. The highway rose and fell as if reconsidering itself, and he threaded past a pickup truck carrying pallets, a sedan with a smiley face sticker that seemed indecently optimistic, a bus whose windows held reflections of people who didn\u2019t know what they would learn today. His hands remembered to keep the wheel steady even as his head flickered. He kept the radio off because he didn\u2019t want anyone else\u2019s voice claiming the air, and he kept the window cracked because he wanted the day to be allowed in even if it felt like a trespass. The thought formed and unformed that if he did not see the place with his own eyes it would remain an arrangement of syllables, and he could not have that; he needed the hard edge of curb and the angle of light and the ordinary ugliness of a pole with signs that told you how to behave.\n\nGuelph sat in its bowl that day, the sky a lid not convinced it wanted to press down. The Hanlon carried him north, and he cut across toward campus because his muscle memory pointed there, because if he didn\u2019t aim at something he\u2019d drift through the day and end up back where he\u2019d started without having touched the fact. The intersection announced itself before he saw it, a slow jam of cars becoming a knot of pedestrians becoming the soft boundary of police tape strung like ribbon from sign to sign. A cruiser idled under a tree that hadn\u2019t learned spring yet, and the light cycled dumbly, obedient to its program. There were cones. There were fluorescent vests. There were people holding their phones chest-high as if they might catch the event of healing on camera. There was a bike, small, laid down where it had been set aside by someone who didn\u2019t want to put it on its side but didn\u2019t know where else to put it. It had a bell and a scrap of ribbon like a wish.\n\nHe parked two streets over and walked, feeling like he had come to a house that would not let him in. The tape hummed in the lazy wind, a taut music that had lost its tune. He stood near a newspaper box and leaned his shoulder on it because his legs had decided that was the thing to do. A woman with a blue scarf told a man with a hat what she had heard, and the words slotted themselves into the air around him even though they were not intended for him. The light was green, she said, and then red, and then who could tell; sometimes the world chose its colors too fast. Someone said the child had a helmet. Someone said no, the helmet was in the backpack. Someone said the driver got out immediately. Someone said the driver looked like he knew how to run. Someone said he was famous, like that could help or hurt.\n\nBart looked away and then back, the way you might with an animal that could hurt you if you respected it too much. He took his phone out and put it back and took it out again, and this time he typed, because if he didn\u2019t type something he would stand there until dark. He wrote, \u201cWhere are you,\u201d and then erased it, and wrote, \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d and then erased that too because it sounded like a bad joke, because the word here had failed to hold any meaning in his mouth. He typed nothing and sent nothing and shoved the phone into his pocket as if it had tried to bite him. A boy in a black hoodie slipped under the tape with the smooth entitlement of youth and got two steps before a constable told him gently to go back. He did, and put his hands in his pockets like there might be a map to when this hadn\u2019t happened.\n\nHe walked around the block once and then twice, scuffing his shoe on places that looked like answers from some angles and like mockery from others. The smell of gasoline sat like a punctuation mark under the brighter notes of coffee and grass and the leftover onion from a food truck. A man who could have been in his fifties asked him if he had seen it and Bart said no and the man nodded like he had expected that answer and had prepared for it anyway. On the far corner he found the first hard sign of how the city would grieve\u2014a single flower, yellow, laid against the base of a streetlight that had no interest in flowers. The flower looked wrong there, like a hand placed on a stranger\u2019s back.\n\nHe did not know the hospital with the confidence of habit, but his location app did, and he let it guide him without looking like that was what he was doing. Guelph General sat low and stubborn, the sort of building that seemed to be doing work even when it was just watching its own doors. The parking lot was a low murmur of arrival and departure, the bumpers of cars holding the dust of other days. He found a spot and misjudged the lines and corrected himself and found the front desk and said a name that tasted like asking too much. The volunteer there had a pin shaped like a sun and eyes like someone who knew a hundred stories a day and kept them all to herself. She didn\u2019t wince when he said Rowan\u2019s name, and he wanted to thank her for that tiny mercy. She said she couldn\u2019t tell him anything but he could take a seat.\n\nThe waiting room was busy in the way of places that are always busy; it did not amplify his urgency because it had a supply of its own. He sat with his knees slightly apart and his elbows on them and his hands making a cradle he did not know what to carry in. A TV mounted by the ceiling did the thin unhelpful thing of rolling footage of the intersection he had just seen with his eyes, cutting to a headshot of Rowan from last spring where his smile looked like it had been told to occur. The chyron was a bad sentence written by someone working against time. He did not look away and he did not keep looking; he took in one frame and refused the next. On the far side of the room a child laughed at a cartoon on a tablet, the sound like a clear bell from the other side of a hill.\n\nHe texted Tess once he could make his fingers choose letters, and told her only that he was in Guelph and he was waiting and he was fine as far as he knew. She wrote back faster than he hoped she would, told him to eat something even if it tasted like cardboard, told him she was with Mom buying groceries and they would not turn on the TV until she said they could. He told her that sounded impossible and she said not if you hide the remote, which she had. He put the phone down and folded his hands again and then unfolded them because the action looked like prayer and he wasn\u2019t ready to commit to that for an audience.\n\nAfter a time that did not make sense, a man in a jacket with the team\u2019s colors on it stood in the hallway and looked like he did not want to be seen. He had the posture of someone who had aged out of sprint drills and into budgets, and his gaze hit the waiting room like a thing thrown at a wall. Bart stood without meaning to and the man saw him see him and there was a small private flinch that told Bart he was not wrong to be here. The man came over, and up close he was all coffee and beard and eyes that had forgotten sleep.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Bart,\u201d he said, and he did not make it a question because the world had given him enough today.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bart said, and he realized his voice had chosen the lower register it took when he spoke to coaches. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if this is\u2026 not useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing but useful,\u201d the man said, and his gratitude had a rough edge. \u201cHe asked for you. He\u2019s done being talked at by uniforms and strangers with microphones. He asked for you, and I told him if you were reading anything I\u2019d be giving you the wrong job description.\u201d\n\nIt was not a door to permission but it was near enough to count. They walked down a corridor that smelled like cleaning made into a religion, and the lights overhead flickered in the way of lights that are tired but would never admit it. He heard the click of his own steps and thought of spikes on track, of the small echo of speed, and wished he hadn\u2019t because that felt like a theft. They passed rooms with complicated chairs and rooms with machines that breathed for people and a room so empty it looked like a place where stories ended. When they reached Rowan there was no ceremony, just a curtain pulled aside and a chair that tried to be a bed and a face he knew that had lost its arguments.\n\nRowan looked at him like he had looked at the finish line, unprepared for what would be there when the blur stopped. His eyes had learned a new dullness that wasn\u2019t tiredness; it was the kind of thing that fell on you when someone turned out all the lamps in a house at once. He had a bandage on his hand and no other obvious harm, which would make his guilt worse. A nurse touched a gauge with two fingers and left as if she had practiced leaving before. The coach stood back like a wardrobe and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be in the hall,\u201d and closed himself into the corridor.\n\nFor a second they did nothing and that was the right thing. Bart\u2019s body did the calculations it needed to do to keep him upright in rooms where he wanted to crumple. Then he moved and sat in the chair that had not been placed there for him and his knees made a small noise that existed to prove he was alive. He said Rowan\u2019s name and it sounded like a word he had never tried on before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not real to me,\u201d Rowan said, and his voice was hoarse, scraped by the act of bargaining with the universe. \u201cAnd it is. It\u2019s both all the way. And I keep thinking if I put my hand out I\u2019ll feel it like a wall and then I\u2019ll know. But there isn\u2019t a wall. There\u2019s just\u2014air. I keep thinking I\u2019ll smell the\u2014what do you call it\u2014rubber, and the hot metal, and then I\u2019ll wake up. But I already smelled it. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d He lifted his bandaged hand too quickly and cursed at himself, at the room, at the light. \u201cThey keep telling me the things they tell everyone so that they can go home after their shift and not dream. They told me about reaction times. About intersections. About a witness who says he saw a\u2014some motion that you can\u2019t pin on anybody. About how green is not a shield and red is not murder. They told me words like no impairment and no charges at this time. I don\u2019t deserve any of their words.\u201d\n\nHe spoke like a runner breaking form at the end of a hard rep, the sentences spilling where they needed to be held. Bart let them spill because trying to catch them would only make a mess. He found that he had taken Rowan\u2019s wrist without remembering the movement, his thumb on the inside where pulse lives, because we are all animals who check the river when we pass it. The skin there was warm and dry and familiar. It did not resolve anything, which is not the same as being useless.\n\n\u201cDo you know about the\u2014about the kid,\u201d Bart asked, and he hated the question for having to be asked. He would have climbed inside it and taken it apart if he could.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t tell me more than wait,\u201d Rowan said, and the word broke, and he put his free hand over his face as if to keep it from falling apart. \u201cSomebody\u2019s mother screamed outside the taped bits. It had a pitch. You know how you can tell when a crowd is there for five hundred meters and when it\u2019s there for ten? The pitch changes. This had a pitch that was not designed for human throats. And I thought, that will be my brain forever. I thought, I\u2019ll take it if it means there\u2019s still something happening at the other end of it. That\u2019s not charity. That\u2019s\u2014what do you call it. Selfish hope.\u201d\n\nThe shape of hope changed in the room just because he named it. Bart put his elbows on his knees again and leaned in because leaning in was the motion that kept him closer to not falling out of his seat. He told Rowan about waiting in the lobby and not liking the TV and a woman\u2019s sun pin and how you can tell who is ready to give you bad news and who is trying to avoid being made into the shadow that delivers it. He told him he had gone to the intersection like a pilgrim and found nothing he could take back except the fact of it. He told him Tess had hidden the remote at home and would kill him for telling anyone. He told him nonsense on purpose, because nonsense is a language with weight when the words you would normally use have lost their muscle.\n\n\u201cWhat if I\u2019m the person who takes things from the world,\u201d Rowan said finally, and the fact that he could ask that without turning into ash should have counted as proof he wasn\u2019t. \u201cNot medals. Not times. Not wins. I mean the person who makes a line and whatever\u2019s on one side of the line falls into a hole, and what\u2019s on the other side stares down and thinks, that was almost me. You shouldn\u2019t be in here with that person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought my own line,\u201d Bart said, and the joke was trash, but it made something in Rowan\u2019s throat relax. \u201cI\u2019ll draw around us. We\u2019ll look ridiculous. We\u2019ll be saved by how stupid it is.\u201d\n\nRowan exhaled and set his jaw, a gesture he had probably learned from his face in the mirror. He watched Bart the way he watched a curve coming up, measuring and then committing. \u201cIf they tell me that\u2014\u201d He stopped and started again, because starting again is part of it. \u201cIf they tell me the worst, and I keep running anyway, what does that make me. If they tell me the worst and I don\u2019t, what does that make me then. Everything feels like a trap with velvet lining. I want to be punished and I want to be told it will mean something.\u201d\n\nIt would not mean anything in the way he wanted, and Bart could not give him that permission. He said instead that being alive was an insult some days and a mercy other days and you don\u2019t get to know which ahead of time. He told him Rinaldi had tried to keep facts in his mouth and they had spilled out and that made Bart trust him more. He told him that the lights in Kitchener had been wrong last week and he had not made them into a myth and maybe that counted as a practice for this; paying attention without turning everything into a sign. He told him that he did not have to decide anything in a room that called itself an emergency.\n\nWhen the coach came back it was because a man in a suit had joined him in the hall and together they made the shape of inevitability. The suit introduced himself with a name and a firm shake and a tone that lived somewhere between compassion and policy. He told Rowan that the child was in surgery and that the surgeons were the sorts of people who required their own adjectives. He told them that the family had been given their own room, that the hospital had provided a person whose job it was to say the right small things and to protect them from the wrong big ones. He told Rowan the words he had already heard about impairment and preliminary this and further that. He did not say anything about charges, and the air kept its breath.\n\nAfter, the coach asked Bart if he would eat something from a vending machine with him, and Bart said yes and found himself in a smaller room watching the false drama of the coil take its time releasing a snack. He didn\u2019t want the snack and he put it in his pocket and maybe it would be there when he did. They spoke in the language of logistics because logistics is polite in a crisis; the coach would get a hotel and make sure there was toothpaste and a shirt that did not carry the day\u2019s noise. The coach would remind the others, the team, that their opinions were not needed, not today, not here. The coach would make a statement that said nothing and everything. The coach had a list that would keep him from thinking and he was grateful for the list the way a swimmer is grateful for a buoy even if he knows he can float.\n\nRowan didn\u2019t ask him to stay. He didn\u2019t ask him to go. The space between stayed an animal in the room. Bart told him quietly that he would be in the lobby for a while, that he would drive his car in circles if that was more useful, that he would be wherever a person could be who couldn\u2019t fix anything. Rowan\u2019s mouth made the shape of thanks without committing to the vowels. When Bart left the room he had to put his hand on the wall once with his eyes closed, because you can walk away and still have the room dragging a short length of rope from your wrist.\n\nIn the lobby he found a corner with a plant that was trying harder than most plants. He sent Tess another message and then another; he told her what he\u2019d been told and asked her to tell their parents the version that would not startle their mother out of her skin. Rinaldi texted a sentence that sounded like scripture if you were inclined to make runners into worshipers; it said simply, \u201cI\u2019m here when you need a different set of ears, kid.\u201d Monique from the warehouse sent a heart and then wrote, \u201cSaw a headline. Are you okay, actually okay, not just the okay you say when you mean not okay.\u201d He wrote back that he would get back to her and that was the truth. The barista wrote, \u201cDo I need to bring you a coffee you can\u2019t finish,\u201d and he told her no and thank you and maybe later. The world was a set of hands trying to catch a ball while blindfolded.\n\nHe fell asleep for the length of one of those drifting moments that happen when you are not allowed to go home. In that non-sleep he dreamed of Rowan in both the ways he knew him, the boy on the warm-up loop with his fluid gait and the man in the chair with his hand over his face; they walked toward each other and could not quite make the same pace. He woke because his body remembered it needed to relieve itself of the coffee he had not drunk, and then he woke again because his phone lit with a name that would twitch his hands even when he was eighty. The message was a short one, written by fingers that had recently learned how to not shake. It told him the surgeons were still working. It told him he could go if he wanted. It told him thank you again without the vowels.\n\nHe went to his car and got into it and sat there as if that counted as leaving. The dusk had taken the edges of everything and left it softer and worse. He thought about staying in Guelph and then remembered he did not have a toothbrush and then laughed at himself because that was the smallest reason not to stay and the only one that did not make him feel like a coward. He pulled out of the lot and joined the stream of cars that all wanted to get somewhere else and might not. On the Hanlon he kept looking for the place where the road turned back into his life, and when it didn\u2019t he made one.\n\nKitchener held him with its same old blunt hands. The noodle shop smelled like a promise nobody could keep. He set his bag down and took off his shoes as if they were pieces of a day he could tidy away. He turned on the tap and filled a glass and then did not drink it. He sat on the floor and leaned his back on the couch and left the lights off and was the shape of someone who had known a morning and a night and found that they did not belong to the same plan. He did not consider stretching because there are days when the body is a bag you are allowed to put on the floor without apologies.\n\nWhen he woke the next morning it was because the sky had failed to make a case for sleep. He put on shoes without names attached to them so that he was not wearing anything that had promised him speed. He ran the way you walk by a river, alongside it, with respect, not trying to outpace it and not trying to become it. The geese had assembled their ridiculous committee on the grass and looked insulted when he gave them a wide berth; they made their gravelly claims on the earth and he gave them all of it. The path was slick with the last of the night\u2019s rain and he let it make him slower. When a cyclist behind him called out a gentle \u201con your left,\u201d he startled hard enough to shame himself and lifted a hand without looking back because eye contact felt like asking too much.\n\nHe thought not at all and then he thought too much, and then he swung back into that middle place runners live, where the body\u2019s insistence makes a fence for the mind and the mind doesn\u2019t hurt itself on anything for a while. He thought of last Friday at the bridge in the park and how the frog noise had made a kind of applause for their stupidity. He thought of Rowan\u2019s mouth making the choice to smile and then the choice not to. He thought of the kid with the ribbon on his bike and he told himself that thinking could be a kind of honoring if you did it gently enough. He counted the lamps over the water when he crossed and the numbers held like nails hammered into a good beam.\n\nAt the warehouse Monique folded him into her version of grace, which involved hot blueberry muffins and a scolding that did not sting. She told him he had permission to be useless and he told her he would be offended by that if he weren\u2019t, and she squeezed his shoulder once and left it. The boxes did what boxes do; they let him feel competent with small weights and let him pretend his hands were designed for holding. He didn\u2019t check the news until lunch because he did not want to turn the day into a series of jolts; then he did, and found that the story had set in like concrete. The reporters were using phrases they could be proud of and phrases they would regret. The comments were knives tucked into socks. There were photos from meets where Rowan looked immortal, which felt like an additional harm. There were photos of a teddy bear propped at the base of a pole, which felt like the only true thing.\n\nHe took out his phone again in the late afternoon and typed, \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d and this time he sent it, because he had to say that somewhere even if it did not cross any distance. He did not expect an answer and the lack of one was a relief. He went to Tess\u2019s after work because he had told her he would and because there is nothing like sitting at a kitchen table while someone cuts an onion badly and tells you about a coworker\u2019s cat. She wore a sweatshirt with paint on it and the dog climbed into his lap in direct contravention of the laws of physics. She told him she had watched fifteen minutes of a documentary about mushrooms and then had panicked herself into making brownies, and he told her none of this was allowed to make him feel better and it did anyway. She stared at him too closely and then stopped because she is who she is, and put a hand flat on the table like she was grounding it.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to come with you next time,\u201d she asked, and the coda was unspoken\u2014If there is a next time, if a next time exists that will let someone like me in without shattering.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the next time is,\u201d he said, and his voice surprised him with how steady it had chosen to be. \u201cI don\u2019t know what any time is right now. I know he\u2019s\u2026 there, and that he is the worst combination of alone and surrounded, and that he probably hates that I can go home and he has to stay in rooms that smell like liquid soap.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like someone who is thinking about winning,\u201d she said, and he made a face at her that tried to be a smile and ended up being a brief, failed frown.\n\n\u201cIf we talk about winning I\u2019ll climb into the cupboard and live there,\u201d he said, and she said that could be arranged, and then they ate cardboard pizza because it was what they had, and it was fine because it was hot and because they were.\n\nThat night his phone woke him on the first ring and he forgot to be disoriented. He knew the sound in his bones; he had hidden that ringtone for one person and now here it was, too loud in the small room. He answered and said his own name because he did not trust anything else to come out. On the other end, Rowan breathed like the air had become a set of steps he had to climb to reach speech.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d Rowan said, and his voice didn\u2019t crack the way you might expect; it made a lower failure, a kind of grinding like stone on stone. \u201cThey told me. The doctor had a pen in his pocket that kept knocking against the edge of the paper and I thought, that should be illegal, that noise, and then he stopped the pen with his finger and there were so many words and the only ones that stayed were \u2018we did everything\u2019 and I hate those words so much and I love them and I hate them.\u201d He paused and Bart said the small noises that keep a person connected to the phone, and Rowan continued in a rush, because you can only hold the floodgate so long. \u201cThere was a candle thing at the intersection. Already. I didn\u2019t go. I watched from the other side of the street and I counted the shoulders. People\u2019s shoulders do this thing when they\u2019re pretending to stand up straight, they go hard and then down and then they hold. There was a kid with a baseball cap who kept trying to give his mother a tissue and she kept not noticing her hand was empty. I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t be anyone they can see. I can\u2019t be anyone they don\u2019t, either.\u201d\n\nBart felt the floor tilt and then right itself because his body had to keep him level. He told Rowan he was sorry, and that word was nothing and everything, and he told him he would come now if that made sense, and Rowan said he was at a hotel with a name that had been bought by a chain and he gave Bart the room number like it was a secret even though it wasn\u2019t. He put on the first shirt his hand found, and he put on clean socks because that felt like respect, and he took his keys and did not forget his phone charger because you learn some things the hard way and others by watching your sister live.\n\nThe drive felt shorter in the dark because distances do not hold their shape without edges. He put on the radio this time because the quiet had started to amplify his breath in a way he didn\u2019t like, and a song came on that had meant something small to him last year and he let it be nothing now so that he could keep it. At the hotel the carpet in the lobby had a pattern that had been designed to be ignored. The night clerk had a face that said he had trained for nights with more bored college kids and fewer tragedies, and Bart wanted to tell him he was doing a good job at sitting upright, which is a job some days. He got a key card with the wrong name on it and corrected it with a smile that did not reach his eyes, and pressed the elevator button with the caution of a man disarming a bomb.\n\nRowan opened the door before Bart knocked, as if he had been standing on the other side with his hand on the handle. His hair had given up and so had his jaw. He wore a T-shirt with a logo that had lost its meaning and socks that made him look less like a statue and more like a person. The room had the smell of too much air conditioning and a chair that looked like a waiting area for a better chair. They didn\u2019t do the thing with arms right away because they weren\u2019t ready to do anything so honest; instead they stood so close that their exhalations could have been the same breath, and let the proximity itself be the admission.\n\n\u201cHe had a ribbon on his bike,\u201d Rowan said, and the sovereignty of that detail broke Bart open in a place he did not know he had kept strong. \u201cRed. Or not red. I think of that ribbon and then I think of his mother saying please into the air like it had taken something and would give it back if she used the right word. I walked back to the intersection after, late, and the lights kept switching and it made me want to tear them down because they were still doing their job and what right did they have to keep going. I know that\u2019s stupid. Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell you anything you already know,\u201d Bart said, and then he let himself step forward, because not stepping forward would have been a louder statement than any sentence. The hug was not pretty and it was not brief; it was not the kind that fixes anything because those are either fake or miraculous, and he did not believe in either tonight. He held him until Rowan\u2019s back loosened under his hands, until the breathing found the layer below the scrape, until one of them made a sound that belonged in a different decade and the other pretended not to notice.\n\nThey sat on the foot of the bed with the kind of distance between them that made room for holding hands, and they did, and the quiet was not empty; it had a texture. Rowan told him about the cop whose hands shook as much as his did, which made him feel less alone; he told him about a journalist who had asked for a quote with a tone so soft it could have been kind and could have been a sharpened edge. He told him about his coach, who had practiced saying no into a phone until it sounded like yes. Bart told him about the woman with the sun pin again, because that felt like a thing to repeat, and he told him about running slow and counting lamps, and he told him about Tess\u2019s onion and she would be annoyed with him for telling everyone about her onion for years.\n\nAt some point he realized he was hungry and the thought embarrassed him, and Rowan looked at him with interest like a scientist who has found a live specimen of normal life, and they ordered fries from a place that pretended to be open twenty-four hours and wasn\u2019t. The night clerk knocked softly and placed a bag on the carpet and left without making eye contact, and Bart had a sudden hat-raising love for him that was unreasonable and unearned. They ate fries like two men who had not been told that eating would not change the shape of the day, and it was good because salt and oil are honest even when everything else is performing.\n\n\u201cThis will be a thing,\u201d Rowan said finally, and he didn\u2019t mean the two of them, he meant the news cycle and the events and the people with opinions that made them feel full. \u201cIt will be a thing with legs. It will have a mouth that doesn\u2019t close. I don\u2019t know if I can run while it eats. I don\u2019t know if I can run if I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if I can do anything except stand near doors and hope they open when I have to move.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know tonight,\u201d Bart said, and he could feel the shape of Rinaldi in his voice in the way he measured the timing of his words. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to know tomorrow either, if tomorrow refuses to be a day and wants to be six. You can wait and count the lamps. You can wake up and decide to go outside and then not. You can bring a trainer to the lobby and unpack it here and look at it and pack it again. There isn\u2019t a correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make things sound manageable,\u201d Rowan said, and then he laughed in spite of himself, and it made the room widen. \u201cThat\u2019s new.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying it out,\u201d Bart said, and he yawned, which was both rude and human, and Rowan made a face at him that said, look at you, you animal, and then said the thing that was a permission slip; he told Bart to sleep for twenty minutes with his shoes off and his phone on, and Bart obeyed because sometimes you need to be told to do the thing you haven\u2019t admitted is necessary.\n\nHe woke to a darker dark and the shape of Rowan\u2019s shoulder next to his; he didn\u2019t remember laying down, which meant he had been more tired than he had admitted by a lot. He stood and drank from the tiny bottle of water that tasted like the inside of plastic and the ghost of rivers, and he washed his face in a sink that didn\u2019t quite understand his jawline, and he looked at himself in the mirror and did not try to make his face make sense. He told Rowan he would go home and be the person who answered texts and went to work and ran slow, and he told him to call him even if it wasn\u2019t for anything, especially if it wasn\u2019t for anything. Rowan nodded in the way of a man who had moved through a day like a field of mines and found a patch of grass and couldn\u2019t trust it yet.\n\nOn the drive home he let the radio say what it wanted because he could not keep being the only voice in the car. The lights at Gaukel were their same wrong self and he obeyed them because he had learned how to be a person in a place that made a thousand small demands on his attention and would take him if he did not obey. He climbed the stairs to his apartment and smelled the noodle shop\u2019s generosity and stood in his kitchen and put his hands on the counter like he was bracing for a wave. The posters on his wall curled and tried to wave him back, to remind him who he was when mornings belonged to him and the track was a benevolent ellipse. He looked at the Guelph meet flyer and the tiny face in the corner that had made him learn someone\u2019s eyes too well, and he did not cut it down because destroying paper is a gesture that means more to the person making it than to the paper.\n\nIn the days that followed the story learned the shape it would keep for a while. There were vigils and statements and a photograph released by the family of a boy smiling with both his front teeth in, and it made Bart sit down on a curb and put his head in his hands and breathe into his own palms for the heat of it. There were people who said accident like it could be a balm and people who said negligence like that could. There were timelines and diagrams with arrows, as if you could draw a map to the moment where everything turned cruel and then walk backward out of it. There were long apologies written by PR teams and short ones spoken by a single person trying to reach across a river. There were distances no one could cross.\n\nHe ran. He ran because it was his way of carrying a day without dropping it. He ran slow sometimes and fast when his body made a case for it and he didn\u2019t fight it. He didn\u2019t go to the track for a while because that felt like a room with too much history, and when he did, he did not take his watch out of his bag, and he did not ask for Rinaldi\u2019s voice and he got it anyway. Rinaldi watched him the way you watch a flame after it has caught, careful not to blow, careful not to starve it, and when Bart finished a set of easy laps he didn\u2019t need to say anything. The coach walked beside him on the infield and asked about Tess\u2019s dog and said something about the geese like they were one of the teams. He said, \u201cBase work. Base work is what you have when everything is a climb,\u201d and Bart nodded because this was one of the old lines that had forgotten to be trite.\n\nThere was a night when they went to the intersection together, not because either of them liked the idea of making a pilgrimage out of it, but because there are places you need to see with the person who is carrying the largest part of your fear for them. It was late enough that the road had put on its quiet, and the candles in jars made wavery pools, and the teddy bears looked like they were deciding whether to stay out and catch cold. Rowan kept his hood up and his head down and Bart stood a half-step to the side because not being in front is a skill too. They didn\u2019t speak for a long time because everything that could be said had a louder twin nearby, and then Rowan said, in a voice a person would use to coax a nervous dog, that the lights had a rhythm and he could feel himself syncing to it, which scared him more than anything.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t turn into a metronome,\u201d Bart said, and Rowan huffed a small smile, which was a thing to mark on a map.\n\nThey crossed when it was appropriate, and they did it like a ritual, and they stood on the far curb and looked back and people left them alone because grief can look like privacy if you do it right. It was not a thing that healed anything, but it made a notch on the stick they were using to measure the days. They went for coffee in a place that did not have a palatable bean in the building, and they sat and did a crossword without any intention of finishing it, and it was miraculous in the way that going to a dentist and not crying can be if you are five years old.\n\nOn a morning when the wind decided to pretend at summer, Bart woke with the thought that no one had asked his legs whether they were ready for a race and maybe that was why they were not angry at him. He had a meet on the calendar that someone would cancel for him if he asked, and he found that he did not want them to; he wanted to go and wear a number and not be the man on the steps of a hospital, at least for ten minutes. He told Rinaldi and Rinaldi said, \u201cFast is not disrespectful if you do it right,\u201d and Bart said he didn\u2019t know how to do anything right and Rinaldi said he hated when people were literal.\n\nThere would be more days. There would be days when the only thing he could do was sit on the kitchen floor and let the sunlight make a line across his knees and there would be days when the line at the end of four hundred meters would become the only honest idea in the world. There would be more nights when the hotel room smell would make him hungry and sick at once, and there would be mornings when the noodle shop\u2019s steam would be the closest thing to a blessing he could tolerate. There would be Rowan\u2019s mouth making the decision whether to be a smile and there would be his hands doing the work of lacing his shoes no matter what came out of the television. There would be numbers to count that didn\u2019t argue and people to love who did. He could feel the long race under his feet, the one that did not care about splits, and he told his legs they were allowed to be tired and they told him nothing back as always and he would have been worried if they had.The day of the meeting is one of those blank ones the calendar leaves unadorned so the world can write on it in its own bad handwriting. Rinaldi calls it media day like it\u2019s a training block and tells Bart it\u2019s none of his business and then adds, softer, that everything is his business now if he wants it to be. The athletics office at the University is a set of beige halls punctuated by framed jerseys and the kinds of trophies that always look like they\u2019re staring at the end of the hallway for an exit. Bart parks illegally and puts his hazard lights on because pretending to be in a hurry makes him feel like he has a reason to be.\n\nInside, he is not a name on any list, but runners have a way of gliding through doors on muscle memory and the kind of politeness that makes administrators tired. He finds a bench outside a conference room with a number on it he won\u2019t remember, and the door eats and spits people in suits and someone with a microphone that looks like it grew there. He puts his phone in his pocket and takes it out and puts it back, and when he hears Rowan\u2019s voice behind the door it is mostly absence, the vowels dulled down like he has filed his teeth to avoid an accident.\n\nHe tells himself he will not count minutes. He counts the squares in the carpet instead and calculates splits on them that make no sense; if one square is a hundred meters then this hallway is a quarter mile and he could do it in sixty seconds if he leaned into the corners. A receptionist coughs, a printer complains, someone\u2019s laugh scrapes the ceiling. When the door opens it\u2019s Rinaldi first, wearing his long defeat of a coat and a face that has become a wall between two rooms. He sees Bart and does not look surprised, which is something they are both grateful for. He lifts his chin toward the courtyard and Bart follows, hands in rings in his pockets like he might swing if he had the nerve.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Rinaldi says, and the answer does not fit the question Bart didn\u2019t ask. \u201cHe\u2019s not fine. He walked through a field of microphones and didn\u2019t step on any of them. I hate that I\u2019m proud of him. They wanted the sentence they could turn into a line under his name. He gave them the one he can live inside for a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the sentence,\u201d Bart asks, because he needs to know the size of the house his friend has just moved into.\n\n\u201cThat he is sorry and he does not expect forgiveness and he will do what he\u2019s told. That he\u2019ll think before he tries to do anything that looks like moving forward. That he is not going to argue with anyone\u2019s grief and he expects to be argued with anyway,\u201d Rinaldi says. \u201cThey made him practice it like a start.\u201d\n\nThe door opens again and Rowan comes out with the curve of his shoulders wrong, as if he\u2019s wearing a weight vest the exact size of his own breath. His eyes find Bart without scanning, a magnet trick. For a half second there is nothing in his face and then all of it rushes back in and crowds, and he slows in that way he does before a turn. The PR woman behind him puts a hand up near his elbow and he steps just out of range without making it an insult. He nods at nobody and somebody and then he is in the courtyard with them and the door clicks shut on the sound of the printer and the cough and the trophies.\n\n\u201cThey want me to write something,\u201d he says, and his voice has the gravel of a thousand small no\u2019s. \u201cSomething longer. Not a statement. A\u2014piece. I hate that word. A thing they can put somewhere that isn\u2019t a press release, that makes me look human and doesn\u2019t make anyone else less human. They said I could take my time and then told me a deadline.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want help,\u201d Bart asks, and he means: do you want me to sit in your hotel room and name the things you can\u2019t and make eggs and get the words out of your hands with mine.\n\n\u201cI want a different head,\u201d Rowan says, and then shakes his like he disagrees with himself on principle. \u201cBut yes. If you want to sit in a room while I fail at sentences, I would be grateful. I want to say one thing I mean without it turning into a stone someone throws at a window.\u201d\n\nThey go and sit with paper that pretends to be safe and a blank document that is actually a cliff-face. Rowan stares at the blinking cursor like it\u2019s testing his reflexes, and he writes a line and erases it and writes another that is just worse and then writes a clean one and leaves it. He doesn\u2019t show it to Bart and doesn\u2019t have to; Bart can read it in the way his shoulders lift when he hits a period. He doesn\u2019t tell Rowan what to say and he doesn\u2019t stay out of the way; he tells a story about the lights at Gaukel and the way the hand makes a dare and how sometimes the dare is to wait even when your legs are telling you their version of truth. He talks about counting lamps and about a boy\u2019s ribbon and a pen hitting a page, about the things that should be illegal and the things that just are. Rowan listens like he runs, with all of him, and then he turns back to the screen and types slowly, like he\u2019s setting down something fragile that he knows he\u2019ll have to lift again.\n\nTess texts from Kitchener to say the dog has learned a new trick where he sits before she tells him to, and sends a photo that looks like the dog invented the idea of good. She adds a link to a local opinion column that uses phrases like shared roads and communal sorrow and consequences and the awful necessary, and Bart does not click it. He leaves the link in the chat like a traffic cone. He sends back a picture of Rowan\u2019s ear because he has accidentally zoomed too close and because it makes Tess laugh so hard she sends a voice note that is just wheezing and a soft swear.\n\nThere is talk of a service, private, for the family, and Rowan says the family has sent a message through a person whose title is something like coordinator. The message is not a request and not an invitation; it is the sort of communication that lets a person like him know the family knows he is a person, which is generous and impossible. They tell him they understand if he cannot attend and it is simultaneously the only thing he wants to do and the last thing. He asks Bart if he will come and be the piece of him that can stand up in seats and look at the floor and breathe, and Bart tells him yes before the question finishes because there are things you say yes to as a lever against the world.\n\nThe day is warm in the way that makes suits mean and dresses honest. The small chapel is a language he does not speak and does not want to be caught learning wrong, and Bart is a small rectangle of steadiness two pews in, next to a woman who dabs at her eyes with a napkin that has a coffee ring on it. Rowan sits where the coordinator tells him to sit, not in the back because that would look like he was hiding, not in the front because that would feel like a theft. He sits in the second-to-last row and counts the knots in the wood because numbers don\u2019t argue. The boy\u2019s name is said, which makes him permanently someone to the room, not an absence. Stories are told and they have the shape of a small person who collected bottle caps and liked the letter R because it felt like a race when you said it. People laugh in the sharp way that makes laughter behave. People cry in the private way that makes crying an honest verb. When a song starts, Rowan stands because everyone stands, and he feels like his knees are not part of his body, as if they are on loan and he will have to return them with notes about scuffs.\n\nAfter, there is a line winding toward the family and the family\u2019s hands are an assembly line and it makes Bart want to unspool the ribbon and tell everyone to go home and write letters instead. Rowan doesn\u2019t go into the line. He waits where he\u2019s told to wait and he considers leaving and he considers staying until they turn off the lights. In the end it is the father who appears, as if conjured, standing at Rowan\u2019s elbow with a face that has learned what it looks like when it makes someone else feel better and what it looks like when it does not. He holds out a hand and Rowan takes it because this is one of the rituals that has weight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to you,\u201d the man says, and his voice is the scrape of a man who has made decisions he did not want to make. \u201cBut I know if I were you I would want to say sorry and I would hate myself for how small it would sound. I know you did not wake up yesterday and choose to put my boy in a room with white lights. I know you have a life you are supposed to go back to and that it will be crowded now with people with things to say. I will not ask you to punish yourself and I will not tell you how to be. But I will tell you that if there is anything useful you can make from this, do it in his name and not yours. Do you understand me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Rowan says, and the words are not strong and not enough and not nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d He stops, because his mouth has run out of permission. \u201cI will try. I am sorry in a way that does not change anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt changes you,\u201d the man says, and his grip tightens once, not to hurt, to mark. \u201cThat matters to me because it will keep you from forgetting. I don\u2019t want you to forget. I don\u2019t want anyone to forget him. That does not mean I want to see your face. I am not that kind. But I will not make a hobby of hating you. That would make him into something he was not.\u201d\n\nBart watches this and feels the strange lightness that comes when a room heavier than air lets you stand. He thinks of his father\u2019s hockey poster and the rituals people build to keep the flood at bay. He thinks of Rinaldi\u2019s old line about base work, and how some work you do on your own in the dark and no one times you and you get no medal for it and still it is the whole point.\n\nThe next week the meet is in Windsor and the drive is longer than any good idea, straight and then not straight, past fields that have decided to be green as if it were only ever a decision. Bart reads the starters list and finds his name further down than it has been lately and he likes that; he likes the smallness of it. He likes that he will not be announced as the man who beat anyone, just as one more pair of spikes. Rowan does not come, because there are only so many rooms a person can sit in while strangers climb in and out of them with their eyes, but he sends a text before call room: run clean, run ugly if needed, save no stupid pride for later. Bart puts his phone face down and breathes like he could pre-pay for oxygen.\n\nThe track there has a texture he hasn\u2019t felt since college, the grain of it coarser, the corners tighter, the wind coming in from the river with a voice you can\u2019t teach. Rinaldi says to treat it like an old argument; don\u2019t expect to win, expect to say what you came to say. The gun is not a surprise and the field does what fields do, sorts itself, tries to mess with itself, tries to make a plan out of elbows. He sits and he floats and he refuses to use any of his anger because he has promised himself and someone else that he will put that resource somewhere that pays interest. The bell feels less like panic and more like a suggestion, and he goes when his legs have found their own yes. He finishes in a place that is not a headline and looks at the clock and it gives him a number he can love without apologizing to it.\n\nLater, sitting in the bus with his forehead on the cool of the window, he texts Rowan his time and Rowan sends back the mouse emoji and then the knife and then the heart and then writes, I am so unbelievably proud of how ordinary that looks on paper. It busts something open in him and the laugh that comes out is stitched with relief. He turns the camera on himself and the other men in the row make faces like clowns and he sends that too, and Rowan writes, I would say ugly but that\u2019s exactly what I told you to be, and Bart writes back that Runner\u2019s World will never put him on a cover with that mouth.\n\nThere are meetings now with people who run charities for roads and bikes and city planning, the kinds of folk who know the color of every light and the cost of every bulb. They ask Rowan to come to one and he does not promise but he ends up there anyway, at a community center that smells like last week\u2019s bingo and this morning\u2019s lemon cleaner. He stands in front of a projection of a diagram with white lines and arrows and he says that he is learning more about stop times and human reaction than he ever wanted to know. He says he will give money and time and also he will listen to people who build things, which is harder than giving money because it means some of the things you think are obvious are actually the opposite. He nods when an old man in a plaid shirt tells him he\u2019s doing it wrong and he nods when a young woman with a nose ring tells him he\u2019s doing it right and he leaves not knowing which nod will grow something. When he gets back to his car he texts Bart, I said yes to wearing a hideous T-shirt for a 5K and I will make you wear one too, and Bart says, make it purple and I\u2019m out.\n\nAt home, Tess is thinking about moving out from their parents\u2019 house for the third time in as many months. She has a spreadsheet, which means she is serious in a way that makes their mother nervous, and she brings it over to Bart\u2019s place and lays it on the kitchen table like a surgical plan. He makes coffee that tastes like effort and nods while she explains why the second floor walk-up with the weird landlord is somehow better than the one with the good light. She pauses in the middle of explaining hydro and says in the same voice, he texted you, didn\u2019t he, and Bart says yes, and she says are you breathing, and he says yes, exceedingly, and she says okay and goes back to the spreadsheet like she hasn\u2019t just put a hand on his head and smoothed down the worry.\n\nThey go to parents\u2019 night for a cousin\u2019s recital and sit on folding chairs that pinch the back of Bart\u2019s thighs, and a child plays Ode to Joy with the fervor of a man escaping a burning building and a grandparent records every second in a vertical video that will live on a device forever. Owen, the cousin with the trumpet, misses a note and grins at the floor and the applause lifts him anyway. After, in the crowded school hallway, a woman Bart remembers vaguely from someone\u2019s book club stops him and says she saw him on TV in the background of something and is he the runner, and before he can say anything she is telling him that she thinks it is brave, what they are all doing, which is a sentence with no clear subjects. He nods until nodding becomes a mode.\n\nThere is training that is just training, which feels like finding a belt loop in the dark. There are long runs through the industrial part of town where the smell of molasses from a factory makes the air taste like cookies, and through the park where the geese have had babies and their meanness has turned into a focused sort of watchfulness he respects. There are drills that do not ask for philosophy and weights that do not ask for apologies. There are the kind of numbers that belong on the watch and the kind that belong in a different part of your chest and both matter in proportion that changes each day. There is the ache in the right ankle that has learned to raise its hand when the weather changes. There is Rinaldi adding two hundred meters to the end of a session for no reason and then taking them away for an even less good reason.\n\nOn a Tuesday evening when the light sticks around in an affectionate way, Bart and Rowan sit in a park in Guelph with coffee that tastes like someone boiled a shoe and talked it into believing. They don\u2019t talk about the thing first; they talk about shoes and coffee, the lies they like best. Then Rowan puts his cup down and says the family wants to set up a fund in the boy\u2019s name and would he help with the race they are going to hold, it is going to be a fun run which is a phrase that makes him want to punch the sky and then apologize to it. He says he cannot imagine speaking there but he can imagine making a course that is not a hazard and a start line that\u2019s fair and a finish that gives people the feeling, the brief feeling, like they have unhooked themselves from everything and are floating and will not plummet.\n\nBart tells him he will bring cones and whistles and the barista with the beanie who knows how to bark at people in a way that makes them love her. He tells him he will run the perimeter and pretend to look serious when what he will be doing is holding his breath for the whole hour. He tells him he will make sure there are more port-a-potties than anyone thinks is reasonable because that is one of the only things that can make an event feel like someone cared. He does not tell him that he is scared of the intersection, which has become not an intersection but a member of the cast, a person at the table with a drink in front of them.\n\nAfterward they go back to the hotel because hotels have become their shared neutral zone, places where no one has hung pictures yet and the art is meaningless. They sit on the carpet with a bag of grapes and a bag of bad popcorn and the television on with the sound off because mouths moving without sound is easier to share a room with than mouths with. They lean into each other like they are two pieces standing up together and pretending they are a wall. They kiss without turning the world off because it doesn\u2019t, and it is new and not new, and they allow themselves the kindness of not making metaphors out of it. Rowan laughs against his mouth and says that he will never be good at this, meaning the part where you hold a thing that could break and love it anyway, and Bart says that everyone who is good at it looks worse in photographs.\n\nThere is a day, then, when nothing dramatic happens, and they notice it because they have been trained by the last month to flinch. Bart buys a bag of oranges and they are sweet and he thinks of telling someone and then realizes this is a thing he can keep for himself. Rowan runs on a treadmill because he does not want to learn a new neighborhood and he likes the lie the numbers tell, how smooth it is when there are no lights and no corners and no new shadows; he runs and watches an old meet on mute and makes friends with a recurring blister. Tess sends him a photo of a new apartment with cupboards that close properly and says she signed because sometimes choosing anything is the only way to keep gravity working. Rinaldi stands at the start of the track in his big coat even though it is warm and says nothing for an entire hour like it is a discipline and not a default.\n\nThe fundraisers make their posters. The comments keep coming until they don\u2019t matter in the way that being hit by rain stops being surprising and just gets you wet. The PR people lose interest because they are paid to, and the people with long memories keep theirs. Basketball happens and hockey still has hold over the city\u2019s heart, and a teenager Bart doesn\u2019t know asks for a selfie in the grocery store and says he has been practicing his stride to look like his and Bart says don\u2019t, find your own, mine is borrowed anyway. The dog learns to not bark when he\u2019s asleep, which is the kindest thing anyone has done all month.\n\nOn a Thursday evening when the sky looks like someone oiled it, they go back to the intersection, not to punish themselves but because there are flowers to replace and a note from a child who wrote in purple marker that made Bart\u2019s throat do the thing. Somebody has put a tiny set of plastic cones in a line like a drill for a toy. Rowan looks at them and something in his shoulders lifts, not joy, something adjacent and less theatrical. He picks one up and sets it back down as if it were an egg. He tells Bart he can feel the rhythm of the lights in his bones now and wonders if he will ever unlearn it. Bart tells him he will one day hate that he can\u2019t remember it, and both of them nod because both are probably true.\n\nThey go from there to the bridge in the park because they have decided to make a ritual of soft things, and they lean on the rail and talk trash about geese and make fun of joggers in a way that is affectionate because they are them. They stand close enough to share notices; Rowan points out a bat slicing the dusk and Bart points out a couple arguing quietly about nothing that will matter and both of them agree it is evidence of life. The water does what water does, minding its own business with great drama. A cyclist rings his bell and they step aside in unison and Rowan bumps his hip into Bart\u2019s on purpose and it shocks them both with how simple it feels.\n\nSummer rolls toward them like a dog that is more enthusiasm than aim. The nights get noisy in the way that makes sleep more like a suggestion, and Bart finds himself awake at times he used to occupy only on race days. He goes out once, at midnight, and runs the empty parts of the city where the streetlights are tired and the sidewalks have a scar and feels the particular exile of being the only person doing a thing. He thinks, half joking, of joining a swim of night-shift nurses and cooks who move through lights at the wrong rhythm, and he tells himself this is a base of a different kind and maybe it counts for something that can\u2019t be measured in laps.\n\nThe first time they try to have a real argument, it is about nothing and then about everything. Rowan says yes to too many interviews in a row and becomes a person who is trying to say the same sentence with different mouth shapes, and Bart tells him so. Rowan says he is allowed to punish himself the way he prefers, which is public, and Bart says that is just exercise for other people\u2019s eyes. He says this in the kitchen with a spoon in his hand and his voice takes on a shape he does not like; Rowan stiffens because his body knows that shape and does not want to. It is a ridiculous fight and also it is exactly the kind they will have for the next ten years if they get ten years; it is about how you decide to be in the world when being in the world is a choice that hurts yourself and other people no matter what you pick.\n\nThey stop before they say anything they will have to fetch out of the air and apologize to. Rowan sits down with his back against the counter like he is waiting for a wave to stop galloping forward and he says he is scared of doing nothing because doing nothing feels like disrespect and doing everything feels like theft, and Bart sits beside him and says that is the exact problem of living and he will not solve it tonight so stop asking himself to be a genius. They eat cereal out of the same bowl because that is the compromise the evening offers and it is not romantic, it is just kind, which is better.\n\nThere is the day of the fun run, which is exactly what it says and not what it says at all. The city permits arrive with the briskness of bureaucracy and the volunteers show up with enthusiasm and wrong shoes. Bart wears a bright vest that makes him look like a traffic cone and he is delighted by how ugly he is. Rowan wears a cap low and moves from place to place like a whisper that has learned to walk. The family has chosen a small speech that is not a speech and it makes every person at the start line stand a little straighter without knowing why. Children jitter like caffeine in human form and adults tie and re-tie laces like that is how they will keep their hearts from falling out on the path.\n\nBart does the count and he waits longer than he wants to between three and two because someone is still messing with a stroller and he wants to be a person who gives them a second. He says go and it feels like a good word. People move forward like a tide and he watches their backs for a long time, the way you watch anything you love leave a room without you, and then he goes to his place on the course and points and claps and says things like, yes, that\u2019s a corner, look at you taking a corner, like he has been hired to narrate the day in a nonthreatening way. He finds himself next to the boy\u2019s father at one point and they stand about a meter apart and say nothing for a minute that stretches like dough and then the man says thank you directly to the air and Bart lets the air deliver it because he hasn\u2019t earned catching it.\n\nRowan speaks at the end into a mic that crackles like it is trying to get out of responsibility. He says what he wrote and not what he wrote, because the day has ideas and his sentences have to accommodate them. He says the boy\u2019s name and how it doesn\u2019t belong to him and he says that if the world is going to be as hard as it is then the only mitigation is daily kindness in medium doses. He doesn\u2019t look up for the first part and then he does and he sees the faces and it doesn\u2019t hurt worse, which shocks him. When he is done there is the kind of applause people do when they want sound to be useful, and it isn\u2019t, but it is also not nothing, and that is all they get.\n\nThey go home by which they mean they go to Bart\u2019s over the noodle shop because home is not one place anymore and maybe that is okay, and they stand at the kitchen counter and eat cut-up fruit like they are pretending to be people in an advertisement for health, and then they sit on the floor because chairs are still too formal. The window is open and the smell of broth makes even grief feel like it could be fed. Rowan leans his head back against the cabinet and his eyes close and his mouth goes soft and he does not sleep but he puts down all the weight for a minute and it is a thing Bart wants to memorize, the exact angle of that surrender.\n\nThat night the radio on the shelf, the one that only gets three stations, plays a song Bart remembers from some apartment in college that always smelled like laundry and salsa. He hums it without noticing and Rowan looks at him like he has just told a joke in a language he didn\u2019t know he had learned. They do not dance because that would be cute and they don\u2019t have that kind of energy; they sit and let the music draw a circle around the edges of the room and keep the rest of the world out for four minutes and then the DJ talks and the circle breaks and that is fine. They go to bed without making promises and wake up with the day having made some for them, and they keep the smallest ones because those are the ones that hold.\n\nOn a morning that thinks it is autumn even though the calendar disagrees, Bart stands on the bridge in Victoria Park and watches his breath for the first time in months. The lamps over the water are still on because the light is late, and he counts them without thinking and gets to six and forgets and starts again and it is a ritual that has grown new meanings without asking his permission. He imagines himself ten years from now, on a different morning, counting something else and telling a younger person that numbers are a kindness when nothing else is. He imagines Rowan, not the speed, but the way he leans when he gets serious, and he thinks of that instead of the finish line in a race, because there are other places where arriving counts.\n\nHe runs. He runs like he always has and like he never will again, which is to say he runs inside the shape of his own life and the new annexes the last month has built on it. He passes a man in a Rangers jersey walking a dog with a face like it knows the score. He stops at the light at Gaukel not because the universe has taught him anything but because that is what you do, and when it changes he crosses and nothing extraordinary happens, which feels like a blessing so ordinary he does not know how to hold it in his mouth. He goes past the coffee shop where the barista has put up a sign that says, be kind, or at least be quiet, and he waves and she flips him off in a way that means, take care.\n\nHe goes home and showers and eats eggs and laces his shoes when Rinaldi texts a set that is just a number and a winking face and a skull and he laughs at the stove and text-bullies Tess into coming to the track and bringing her terrible music. He decides to race next weekend and not think about what that means until he is standing on a line, because some decisions you make in pieces, like lowering yourself into cold water. He writes to Rowan without looking at the words, something like dinner and also something like I want to see you breathe, and the reply is not a sentence, it is a photo of a lamp and the words one-two-three-four, and it is enough.The day decided to be bright before it decided to be warm, as if light could trick the air into waking up. Tess showed up to the track with her hair in a knot that held on by conviction and a speaker she claimed would motivate the dead. Rinaldi took one look at the speaker and acquiesced to its existence like a man who knew which battles mattered. He handed Bart the workout with a tap of his thick finger: three by a kilometer at something that looked like honesty with two laps of mercy between, then a tidy ladder down. Tess set her playlist to a war between genres and stretched with the seriousness of someone who had never sprinted and had no intention of starting now. When she started dancing between the reps with the aggressive optimism of a person who had avoided mirrors, three high school kids on the infield watched her like they were trying to decide if adulthood was worth it.\n\nThe intervals bit in the way that tells you your joints remember their job and intend to perform it. Bart ran the first rep like an apology to his lungs and the second like an argument with the false ease of the first, and he ran the third with the kind of focus that made the world a generous blur. He counted the white pebbles embedded in the rubber for a ridiculous distance and let himself think only as far as the next ten meters. Rinaldi gave him a look during the recoveries that was neither permission nor accusation; it was an inventory that kept finding everything in place. At the end of the set, sweat made language more difficult and Bart put his hands on his knees and found the same old floor with the same old gratitude.\n\n\u201cNot bad for a man who\u2019s recently taken up recreational civic engagement,\u201d Rinaldi said, which was his way of indicating that he had seen the fun run posters and had believed them as much as posters deserve to be believed. Tess threw him a towel with excessive force and he let it bounce off his shoulder as if to humor her.\n\n\u201cYour music is war crimes,\u201d he told her when he could breathe and she shrugged like a general.\n\n\u201cFast is fast,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want pancakes or something with vegetables to pretend we\u2019re good people?\u201d\n\n\u201cPancakes,\u201d Bart and Rinaldi said together without looking at each other, and Tess hooted like she had orchestrated the chorus.\n\nHis phone vibrated on his bag when he was collecting spikes like a man clearing pieces of himself off a floor. Rowan had sent him a photograph of a lamp again, the pale light over a hotel desk or a house lamp or something you could find in any city if you looked at the right time. Under it, he had written one-two-three-four but then, for the first time, added five-six and two small boxes that indicated laughter so slight it would only be visible in a certain angle of sun. Bart typed dinner like he was ordering a weather front and Rowan replied without a word, sending only a pin to a greasy spoon he claimed not to be embarrassed by anymore. Tess looked over his shoulder and said make him pay, he owes the universe, and Bart told her this was not a ledger that would ever balance, but he smiled because everything they did would be such ledger work for a while.\n\nHe had been carrying the thought of telling his parents like a coin he couldn\u2019t decide whether to spend. It was an idea that grew heavy in his pocket as the week went on and then became light for no good reason, which was how he knew it had decided for him. He texted Tess that he would be there for dinner and she sent back an array of warnings disguised as jokes. The day of, he brought a cake from the bakery on Duke and felt like a bribe artist, and he stood on the porch of the house he grew up in trying to recall how to open a door without sounding like he was arriving with news. His mother shouted that it was open in a way that had not changed since he was eleven, and the smell of chili and onions and a loaf of bread that could have been a pillow hit him as he turned the handle.\n\nBen was on the couch watching a pre-game show with a volume that believed in itself. He grunted hello and then stood to hug his son because rituals can survive the onslaught of habits. The goalie poster still hung on the wall like a saint you didn\u2019t have room to accommodate in your worldview anymore, which made it no less present. Tess sat at the kitchen table with a bottle of hot sauce and her laptop and the dog under her heel like a contraband, and she lifted her head when he came in and nodded the smallest nod a person could nod. Their mother chattered at the stove, asking about work and about whether he\u2019d seen that article about the new paved path by the river and whether he wanted sour cream or whether he would pretend to be a person who didn\u2019t. It took Bart too long to find a place for the cake on the counter and then he had to take a breath because he didn\u2019t want this to feel like a scene, and then he started talking.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say boyfriend because the word felt like a piece of costume jewelry he\u2019d been given in a different production. He said Rowan, and he said it like a name among other names. He said that they were seeing each other, which sounded like optics but meant something else to his tongue. He said they were figuring it out and he said it wasn\u2019t straightforward because nothing was, and he said he was trying to make room for both running and the grief that ran parallel to it. His mother put down a wooden spoon as if it had become a part of his sentence. Ben looked at the TV like it had betrayed him by being there.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the room to decide which role it would play. His mother crossed the kitchen and touched his cheek in a gesture so tender it made the noise of the house recede. Tess, who had known already and had known how the conversation would feel, kicked him under the table not as a correction but as a way of keeping him in his own skin. Ben inhaled as if learning a new kind of air and then exhaled like an apology to no one in particular.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Ben said, which was both inadequate and sincere. \u201cIs this the kid we\u2019ve seen on TV. I mean\u2014kid. He\u2019s hardly. That man. With the hair. He runs like a television ad for running.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bart said, because the speed with which his father had found the correct person and the incorrect vocabulary was funny in a way that saved the moment. \u201cNot the hair anymore.\u201d\n\nBen scratched his chin in the way he did when aligning thoughts. \u201cI don\u2019t know a lot about how to talk about this without stepping on my own tongue,\u201d he said, and he didn\u2019t look at his wife when he said it like he\u2019d promised himself he wouldn\u2019t outsource. \u201cBut I know about sitting in a crease and having a puck come at you and doing everything you\u2019re supposed to do and still hearing the net pop loud behind you. After games, you look at that and you can decide it means something about you, or you can decide it means something about physics and the bodies involved, and sometimes the answer you pick is different depending on whether there\u2019s anyone behind the glass watching. I ain\u2019t comparing. Just, I know you\u2019re with somebody who\u2019s going to be told by a lot of people what it means about him. He knows, I hope, that the people in this house don\u2019t think it means the same thing those people think it means.\u201d\n\nBart had to grip the back of the chair for a second because his father had never given him a better speech and probably never would. His mother nodded at Ben with a surprise that softened into affection, and Tess let out a small noise that was less a laugh than relief tripping over something. The dog, oblivious to human nuance, sneezed and sneezed again in a way that forced everyone to attend to the ridiculous. Bart said thank you, and he meant it for more things than the person he looked at.\n\nThey ate the chili and Ben put his opinions about three defensemen in the neutral zone back into the atmosphere where they belonged. His mother asked what Rowan liked to eat and then amended it to what did he hate because that would be simpler to plan around, and Bart said he could get him to eat an alarming number of things if you called them the right names. Tess asked a mean question about whether he\u2019d finally found someone who would listen to his thoughts on shampoo and he told her to put the hot sauce down before she injured herself. The evening ended the way it always had, with dishes and the gentle war over who would take leftovers, the kitchen a theater of small competences. If the world outside wanted to make them into more than a family, the kitchen would not honor the request.\n\nThe next day he drove to Guelph and waited in a parking lot that smelled like spring with a headache. Rowan had agreed to see a sports psychologist because, as he said, it was that or let the inside of his head become a room with one lightbulb and no switch. He emerged an hour later with the look of a person who had told a stranger three difficult truths and had not been punished. They drove to a drive-thru that had a loyalty program and ordered fries they didn\u2019t need and a milkshake that made Rowan blink because it was better than his expectations wanted to allow.\n\n\u201cShe has a chair that makes you sit up,\u201d Rowan said, staring at a packet of ketchup like it contained notes for his next race. \u201cBig soft arms so you sink a little, but not enough to pretend. She asked me if I want to run because it\u2019s my job or because it feels like home. It felt like a trick. I told her I want to because it\u2019s the only thing that feels like an answer when someone asks me a question I don\u2019t know how to answer. She said that\u2019s not a bad reason but it can\u2019t be the only one, because jobs and homes both burn down and then where are you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d Bart asked, because asking is efficient and also kind when you don\u2019t think you can be either.\n\n\u201cI said I want to run because it\u2019s how I meet parts of myself I like,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cShe wrote that down and nodded and I wanted to steal the notebook because she was right and I hate it when someone else has custody of my best sentence. She told me to write a better one later. She said we\u2019re going to work on how not to turn every light into a sign. She said I can grieve and still eat lunch in the same day and the universe won\u2019t collapse. Honestly, I\u2019d like to verify.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just ate fries,\u201d Bart said. \u201cLunch verified.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh,\u201d Rowan said, and his mouth tipped at the corner because there was still some grief left in him that didn\u2019t mind being teased.\n\nLondon was the next race and it took longer to get there than it had any right to. The highway made a case for itself that involved farms that looked like paintings in a dentist\u2019s office and cars that believed lane changes were a form of improvisational dance. Bart sat in the bus with a row of men whose knees had no intention of making room for any other knees and listened to someone\u2019s endless argument about whether you could practice negative splits in the weight room. He closed his eyes and dragged a cap over them when the debate drifted toward carbon plates, and he let the window be a television that was state-funded and unwilling to satisfy.\n\nTD Stadium at Western had a track that had seen enough fast men to forget their names, which was comforting. The sun appeared and disappeared behind a bank of clouds like a child playing with a lamp, and the wind came from a direction that made flags honest and made coaches swear. It smelled like cut grass and stale Gatorade and someone\u2019s nerve. Rinaldi met him with a plan that was more attitude than mathematics.\n\n\u201cPace your teammate through a thousand,\u201d the coach said, jerking his head toward a kid who had the shoulders of a person who had learned too many definitions of the word potential. \u201cMake sure he doesn\u2019t get stupid in the first three hundred and make sure he\u2019s tired enough in the last two hundred to learn something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about me,\u201d Bart asked, equal parts relief and disappointment, because the version of him from two months ago would have flinched at being used as a tool for someone else\u2019s day.\n\n\u201cWhat about you,\u201d Rinaldi asked, and then he smiled with his eyes because he was not as cruel as he liked to pretend. \u201cYou\u2019ll get yours again. Today, be useful.\u201d\n\nIt was astonishing how good useful felt when you\u2019d let yourself be changed by having to be useless. He took the line without vanity and let the first lap be slow enough that the field shuffled behind him, cursing, and then he let the second lap rise to somewhere that teased the pack without breaking it. He kept an ear learning and an eye for elbows, and he looked for his teammate\u2019s breath as a way to tell where to be, and he found that if you listen with your bones you can hear someone else\u2019s hope without letting it drown you. He felt ridiculous things\u2014pride that wasn\u2019t about time, calm in the middle of a corner, a strange, quiet happiness when he moved to the outside at nine hundred and let the kid take the rail. He saw the kid\u2019s stride open in a way it had been shy about and he wanted to clap mid-race like a civilian. He finished three places back and did not mind, and the time was a neat number that would not keep anyone awake; he loved it and let it be.\n\nAfter, under the bleachers where the shade smelled like popcorn and old soda, he stretched and watched a distant group of bunched jerseys and felt something he had not allowed himself to feel in a while\u2014a future that wasn\u2019t a cliff. He didn\u2019t notice Rowan until the air around him shifted as if someone had stepped through a doorway. Rowan had come like a person at the back of a theater slipping in after the trailers. He wore an anonymous cap and sunglasses he wouldn\u2019t have picked if he\u2019d had more choices, and he stood in the odd angle that tall men take when they are trying not to be seen. The way his mouth softened when he saw Bart told Bart the running had been the right thing to do with the day.\n\n\u201cYou looked like a solution,\u201d Rowan said, which was the highest compliment he gave anyone. \u201cLook at you, making math you can love.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did what I was told,\u201d Bart said, because that sounded humble and hid the part of him that had found the best kind of joy in it. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be under these bleachers. This is the domain of high school flirtations and discarded sunflower seed shells.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. I missed my window to learn how to carve my initials into aluminum. Show me,\u201d Rowan said, and he leaned into the column beside him and let the shade make a bald case for a moment\u2019s privacy. \u201cI keep wanting to tell you not to look for me when you\u2019re running, like a superstition, like I\u2019ll jinx you. But then I am here and my face gives me away. It\u2019s perverse and I want to find a moral that makes it less so.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou being here isn\u2019t a moral,\u201d Bart said. \u201cIt\u2019s weather. I will dress for it.\u201d\n\nThey touched at the edge of public affection in a place where teenagers would not notice because they were busy awkwarding themselves into whatever came next in their lives. Rowan smelled like sun on cotton and antiseptic and coffee he had decided he didn\u2019t trust, and his hand on Bart\u2019s wrist was not a statement, it was a shared domain of pulse. They didn\u2019t say love because that word sounded like something that had been stolen and pawned too many times. They said other things in the language they had grown by accident\u2014imperatives that were requests, questions that excused themselves before they finished, jokes that cushioned stairs.\n\nThe letter went out the next day. It appeared on a backdrop that looked like anyone\u2019s website and it used his full name and did not use any cheap mechanics for apology. Rowan wrote about waiting at the intersection of grief and responsibility and about how nothing protects you from an outcome once it has decided to be the outcome. He wrote about the boy\u2019s name the way you write someone\u2019s name on a lunch bag you hope returns home. He wrote about lanes and lights and how speed deceives you into thinking you can negotiate with it, and he wrote about stopping, and about wheels, and about looking left and right and counting to a number that will never be high enough and doing it anyway. He wrote that he was sorry in a way that did not imagine that sorry could erase anything, and he wrote that he was learning how to donate his exact pride to people who build things in cities so that fewer of us have to stand on corners and count. He did not ask for forgiveness because that would have made the letter an act of procurement. He asked for nothing because there was not a thing in the world he trusted himself to ask for with clean hands.\n\nThe reactions did what reactions do. Some were so generous they had weight and could hold a day. Some were so sharp they made him bleed again. An old coach sent him a picture of a stopwatch on a track and wrote, still here, and Rowan stared at it until the numbers blurred. A boy from a high school team Bart had paced once sent a message that said simply, my mom says thanks for what you said about helmets, we are buying one that fits this time, and Rowan texted it to Bart and said, this is going to be the piece of mail I keep in my sock drawer.\n\nThe work at the warehouse did its sacred duty of ignoring the news cycle, and Monique handed him boxes that weighed as much as they said they did and told him to stop reading the comments. He told her he had stopped after three and she told him that made him smarter than ninety percent of the world. She put a muffin in his hand without looking at his face and he put it in his bag without pretending he wouldn\u2019t eat it. At the coffee shop the barista had a sign up that said kindness is free, insults will cost you extra, which had exactly the right tone of sermon. She drew a latte art heart on Rowan\u2019s to-go cup once and then smushed it with the lid because she refused to be corny on paper, and he laughed into his collar like the sound might escape.\n\nThe legal side closed out not with a bang but with a statement that came on a Tuesday afternoon when the world had chosen to be having a weather event. There would be no charges. The file would be a slim folder in a cabinet until someone needed to quote a page number. There were sentences about contributory factors and there were sentences about the way white lines get slippery in a certain kind of wet. There were names of agencies and there were forms that would be filed forever. There was an email Rowan did not open and a call he returned anyway to a voice that had to say words to many people who would not slot them in the right place, and that voice told him thank you for your cooperation and he said nothing because politeness felt like both a courtesy and a theft.\n\nThey celebrated the absence of a new wound with dinner that felt like a held breath being let out slowly. Bart boiled pasta at his apartment like a person performing normal for an audience who had paid with the exact change of their day. Rowan cut tomatoes as if they might argue and found they didn\u2019t. They ate with their knees touching under the table and decided that was better than candles. He talked about the therapy session where he had to sit with the image of the intersection without narrating it and how his body had found two new places to keep the tension when the old places got tired. Bart told him about Rinaldi\u2019s new theory that they both knew was a rebranded old one and about Tess\u2019s latest pretense at budgeting. They both tried not to say what would happen when the season got serious, which only meant they said it in the spaces between sentences. After, they washed dishes with the ease you get when you\u2019ve decided not to make a metaphor out of suds, and they left two forks for later because there are always two forks for later.\n\nJuly arrived with the kind of heat that makes everything in the city consider violence. The geese marched their children around like little dictators and every patch of shade was adopted and claimed by something with a spine. Bart adjusted his routes to respect the sun and respect his ankle and respect the limits of his own ego. He sat in the little room with Rinaldi and watched race footage he had watched four times already and found a fifth frame to love and a sixth frame to hate. They entered meets quietly and left them with whatever the day gave them, not feeling entitled to the good or resigned to the bad. He paced more than he had planned, because being useful had become a form of training, and he found that his last lap had learned a lesson from all this generosity and kept a small joke back for him when he needed it.\n\nThere were bad nights. The kind with the bad dream that took all morning to shake off, the kind where Rowan asked if this was the worst thing that would ever happen to him and whether it had already happened and now everything else was an echo. There were good nights that were good in such an ordinary way he almost missed them, the kind where the food came out right and the show was exactly dumb enough and the window let in air without noise. There was a night when he showed up at Bart\u2019s door shaking because someone had stopped short ahead of him and he had braked and nothing happened and everything happened inside his body at once. They sat on the floor and let his nervous system do its electricity and then be done, and afterward he lay on the couch and fell asleep with his face toward the back like a child hiding, and Bart let his hand dangle to the floor and counted the breaths until they left the panic and reentered the general aeolian plane of the day.\n\nThe day after the letter, they took the dog to the park to tire him because neither of them had their own stamina in a form fit for public consumption. The dog performed joy at a level that would have embarrassed a different animal and the geese gave them a look that suggested legal action. Calling the dog back and having him actually come when they called gave both of them an unreasonable amount of confidence in the future of the species. They watched a small boy on a tricycle concentrate into a person in real time and both of them felt their throats behave oddly and didn\u2019t mention it. On the bridge, Bart leaned and pointed out a turtle that had decided to be important and Rowan said there were certain moments you could put in your pocket and this was one, and that had nothing to do with anything in particular and everything to do with the fact they were still finding reasons to put days on shelves.\n\nWhen Rowan said he wanted to go back to the track as an athlete and not as a man who stood near fences, he said it in the quiet of the living room with the noodle shop simmering below. Most of his fear had learned to speak slower by then, and the sentence came out like a chore he wanted to do because he liked how the floor felt afterward. The calendar didn\u2019t care about the drama; it had a line for a meet in Toronto that would attract everyone who had not yet gotten their qualifying time and everyone who was pretending not to care that they hadn\u2019t. Rinaldi raised an eyebrow at Bart in the way that asked a question and didn\u2019t pressure the answer. Bart said he wanted to run there because he wanted to be inside the noise and not outside it, and when he said it he thought he might be lying to himself and then, later, realized he wasn\u2019t.\n\nThey drove in separate cars on purpose because you can love a person and still need a commute to sort yourself into an athlete. The Toronto track felt like a bowl that had not quite learned its own size, and the blue seats made the day feel more official than it had a right to be. Rowan wore his kit with that new, complicated relationship to it\u2014they had gotten coffee together first and sat with their uniforms making them into versions of themselves twenty-year-old them could recognize. When he went to call room, his name sounded like a sentence he had already decided not to translate. He warmed up with a face that told other people to leave him alone and when he caught Bart\u2019s eye across the field, he let his mouth soften exactly at the corners and then pressed forward as if he had been launched.\n\nThe race was a race, not a morality play and not a poem. It did the thing that races do, which is ask you to be your idea of yourself very quickly and very publicly and with very little time to make corrections. Rowan moved with the patience of a man teaching his past self a lesson. He didn\u2019t take the rail like a dare and he didn\u2019t swing wide like a billboard; he sat where he meant to and he paid for nothing he didn\u2019t need. At nine hundred meters it looked like he might fall out of the back of the lead group and then his shoulders did the thing they do when he decides to be a problem, and he went, and the pack went with him, and the wind said something disrespectful and he ignored it, and he came down the last hundred meters with a face that was true because it was ugly and he leaned at the line because you always lean no matter what larger event the day thinks it\u2019s hosting. He didn\u2019t win and he didn\u2019t PR. He put down a time that would have looked like a bad date three months ago and now had the shine of victory.\n\nHe didn\u2019t look for Bart when he came off the line because for a moment he was someone else, and then he did and he found him and he let his head fall forward until his forehead pressed Bart\u2019s shoulder as if it were the finish line he had been aiming for. People around them clapped for the wrong reasons and no reasons and because they liked the noise, and they stepped away from that and into the tunnel where the light behaved itself. They didn\u2019t speak for a time that could have been two minutes or an hour, and when they did it was to say the exact random things that fill in the edges of a bigger thing\u2014water, socks, the way one spike always sits wrong on the fourth toe and how no one will ever fix that on a design level.\n\nDriving home, the radio lost its stations halfway and found new ones that played nothing he recognized. He rolled the window down on the 401 and let the wind punish him for choosing to be alive. In the right lane a truck pulled a small carnival ride that looked obscene out of context, and he had a little laugh at the idea that someone would roll into a parking lot somewhere and assemble joy with bolts. Back at the apartment, he laced his fingers into Rowan\u2019s hair and found that the flat places and the cowlicks had become a map he could read in the dark. They didn\u2019t make the evening into a ceremony; they ordered dumplings and burned the first batch in a way that made them laugh like schoolchildren. When they were done laughing, they were quiet without having to declare it.\n\nThe fund in the boy\u2019s name reached a number that someone had hoped it would and then it reached a number that scared everyone involved and they brought in a person who knew how to keep a thing from becoming a mess. Bart attended a meeting with a whiteboard and sat next to a woman who kept calm by tapping her pen and decided he loved her for how competent she looked in a cardigan. They talked about crosswalks and sight lines and timelines and how many volunteers it took to make a wish into a guardrail. Rowan sat in the corner with his cap on and answered questions when asked and not when not, and if you hadn\u2019t known who he was you would have thought he was a contractor who cared too much.\n\nSummer deepened into itself. The nights lasted longer than seemed reasonable and the mornings had to be pulled into being. They learned how to sleep next to each other without waking at every shift, a skill that felt like a medal no one would ever see. Bart started a silly tradition of buying the cheapest, ugliest postcards from a rack in a drugstore whenever he thought of Rowan while they were apart, and he wrote on them one ordinary sentence and mailed them from wherever he was. A card arrived from Windsor that said there was a dog in the infield who ignored the starter pistol and wasn\u2019t that a metaphor, and a card arrived from Guelph that said he had finally tried the egg salad at the cafeteria and regretted it, and a card arrived from Kitchener that said the barista had been kind to a man who ordered a coffee and then changed his mind and ordered tea three times. Rowan taped them to the inside of a cupboard door because the outside of doors got you in trouble.\n\nWhen the first storm of August rolled through, the city bared its undercarriage. The lights at Gaukel failed in the precise way that proved they were doing work even when they weren\u2019t, and a cop stood in the middle of the intersection with his arms out like a choir conductor for people who had never rehearsed. Bart watched from the window as drivers became students of a subject they had neglected, and he decided to go down to the street to see what made of itself when the instructions were taken away. He found Rowan there because of course he would, standing on the curb with his hands in his pockets like he was watching a friend on stage. They stood under the awning of the noodle shop and listened to rain hit pavement with the sound of applause for a show that had been called off.\n\n\u201cWhen the lights go out, people look at each other again,\u201d Rowan said, as if he had been practicing saying it. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that means anything except that I like watching them try.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the world is one long meet at a track that forgot to paint the start lines,\u201d Bart said, and he knew it was terrible and he let it be terrible and waited for the sneer he would have given himself five years ago.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re nice to look at,\u201d Rowan said into his shoulder, which was a place he had started to speak to more often. \u201cDo you want to go run in this or do you want to pretend to be people who have linen tea towels.\u201d\n\nThey went upstairs and didn\u2019t run. They dried off with towels so old the fabric had learned resignation and they cooked noodles with the windows open because the heat was nothing compared to the heat outside. He turned the radio to the station that always played the same blues song at half past the hour and they stood in the kitchen and swayed because anything more had too much choreography. He thought of the first time he had seen Rowan on a warm-up loop and how his brain had not known where to put him, and he thought of the last time he had seen Rowan cross a line and how his brain had put him in the only place it had left\u2014next to him, with a hand on his back asking nothing he didn\u2019t have to give.\n\nIf anyone had asked him what chapter of his life this was, he would have told them he didn\u2019t keep scripture around for that, and if anyone had asked him where this was going, he would have told them there were routes and distances he liked, but the only thing he trusted was putting on shoes and leaving the house and returning, and making sure he made it across streets with as much attention as he could find. The lamps over the water would still be there in the morning, and he would still count them not because it was magic but because it was useful. He went to bed with the smell of broth in his hair and Rowan\u2019s exhale against his neck and the knowledge that tomorrow he would lace up and do base work, and that, if he was lucky, would be enough to carry them to the next small thing that mattered.Tess\u2019s moving day began with a fight between the sky and the forecast, the white-box truck parked at the curb like it had been invented to misunderstand corners. Bart arrived early because he likes to impress furniture by acting as if it weighs less than it does, and Rowan showed up later in an old T-shirt with the sleeves cut off that made him look like he had been raised by track and field and a band tour. Their mother stood at the top of the stairs with a roll of painter\u2019s tape like she might label the air, and Ben held a box of mismatched mugs the way a man carries a trophy he is not certain he won. The dog barked at the dolly until introduced formally. Tess had a system written on a piece of paper that became a talisman and then pulp in her back pocket; she gave orders as if anyone had signed on to take them and no one minded because she had that talent of sounding like she knew where each piece belonged before the walls did. Rowan took the narrow couch with the dignity of someone who has known the humiliation of elevators, and Bart and Ben did the mattress like an argument they had decided to lose kindly. On the landing, Rowan paused and exchanged a glance with Bart that said he could carry a thing and also he could be carried; it was small and no one fell down the stairs.\n\nThey made three trips because no one knows what volume is until they find themselves staring into the belly of a truck. The new place had a front stoop that made Ben say the word character as if it were a minor illness and a door that stuck in a way only men of a certain age take personally. Inside, light made honest statements on the floorboards and the windows tried to be generous. Tess moved through it with the strange mix of reverence and arrogance you need to claim space. Their mother set down a bag of groceries like a spell for later. Rowan stood in the kitchen with a box labeled Misc Spoons, looked at a drawer, and then at Bart, and they had the brief marital debate of where you put things you do not understand. \u201cPut them where you expect them, not where you think respectable people would,\u201d Bart said, which sounded like a philosophy and made Tess groan and knock her shoulder into his.\n\nThey ate pizza off a flattened box because the plates were trapped behind hubris and bubble wrap. The dog discovered the sun spot near the balcony door and adopted it. Ben told the story of moving into his first apartment and sleeping on a twin mattress for three years because the hockey schedule made time behave like a hostile coworker, and their mother corrected the number of years by half and laughed with her mouth buttoned, the way she does when nostalgia tries something ambitious. There was a moment when the room tilted and nobody spilled it, the quiet acknowledgment that this new address came with the world as it was, not the last one. Rowan sat on the counter, ankles crossed, and watched Tess take ownership of the pantry, and it made something easy in him. He passed Bart the roll of tape and their fingers brushed and they let the fact of it sit there, unremarked, because intimacy that doesn\u2019t need applause is what you hope to earn.\n\nAfter, Bart and Rowan walked back to the noodle building because the truck had been returned and the sky had decided it was done threatening. They took the long way to give the day room. The intersection at Gaukel looked different in the way hair looks different only to people who know you; the new timing had been installed, a little more breathing built into the system, a leading interval that let feet touch asphalt before anything else claimed it. The city had hung a small laminated notice like a permission slip; someone had scribbled \u201cfinally\u201d in blue ink in the margin. Rowan touched his cap, a reflex he had acquired and didn\u2019t interrogate, and watched the hands flash and count like they were learning to hold a beat. A boy in a yellow shirt with a bike that still had training wheels waited without argument, and his mother put a hand on the back of his head like a lighthouse. It was ordinary in the way that is radical because it works.\n\nBack upstairs, Bart made coffee with the care of a person trying to earn a second cup. Rowan sat at the table and unfolded the schedule Rinaldi had sent like a fortune he did and did not want to learn. Nationals had settled themselves on the calendar with their blunt intention. The team chat hummed with the dumb bravado that is how some men admit to fear. Rowan had choices to make that looked like either courage or delusion depending on what angle you took. He suspended the decision between two fingers as if he could keep gravity from finding it by refusing to name it. \u201cIf I go,\u201d he said, \u201cI go because I can finish, even if finishing looks like a different verb than it did last year. I am not going to line up to fail for someone else\u2019s appetite.\u201d Bart nodded, because agreeing is not assent until it is, and he wanted Rowan to know he would show up for whichever version of yes it became.\n\nWork at the warehouse learned their new rhythms like a friend tolerating a baby. Monique maintained a benevolent dictatorship and fed them muffins only on days she declared worth the sugar. She told Bart that carrying someone else\u2019s dresser was good cross-training if he didn\u2019t let the corners get cocky. He told her about Tess\u2019s triumphant cupboard arrangement and she told him that proving to yourself you can make a home is almost as hard as making dinner after a bad day. A guy from receiving said he\u2019d seen Bart\u2019s \u201cboyfriend\u201d on TV and slurred it with the cheeriness of someone who wanted to be on the right side of the joke, and Bart said, \u201cYou probably did,\u201d with a fund of patience that surprised him. Later, in the break room, Monique slid him an orange and said, \u201cHeard anything you want to talk about badly?\u201d and he shook his head and thanked her for the citrus and for not pretending to be neutral when she wasn\u2019t.\n\nOn a hot Wednesday, the athletics office hosted the LPI ribbon-cutting because cities like to pretend their internal organs have ceremonies. There were fold-up chairs and a lectern and a microphone that alternately behaved and didn\u2019t. The mayor said words like proactive and safety culture, and a counselor said the word pilot in a way that let them keep everything temporary if they needed to. Rowan stood with his cap low and his sunglasses on and the world ignored him until it didn\u2019t. Someone at the back hissed what sounded like murderer, and someone up front clapped both hands little and hard like they wanted to drown difference with noise, and the thing passed over them like weather. When they asked if he wanted to say anything, Rowan shook his head and then surprised himself by stepping forward anyway. He said he was grateful people who build things were building them with pedestrians in mind, and that if they needed a volunteer to count seconds, he had time, and he said the boy\u2019s name once because always. He said nothing about forgiveness and everything about remembering and then stepped back. When he sat down, Bart\u2019s knee knocked into his on purpose, a tether in a public room.\n\nThe brand people called in the same breath as the LPI announcement because timing is a sense only money trusts. They wanted Rowan for a shoot that would tell a story about resilience and sport and urban life and whatever else they could stretch into a narrative arc. They had mockups with the color palettes already chosen and a script someone had written to sound spontaneous. Rowan let the call unspool and asked the questions a person asks when they want to pretend they might say yes, and then hung up and stared at the ceiling like he was trying to locate a leak in his principles. \u201cDo it if you want to buy more time for the fund,\u201d Bart said, and surprised himself with how the sentence didn\u2019t taste like compromise. \u201cDon\u2019t do it if the idea of your face on a bus makes you want to live in a shoebox. Do it if it buys you a day where you get to say no to something worse. Don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s noble. Don\u2019t punish yourself for the part of you that likes lights pointed at your bones.\u201d\n\nThey fought anyway, not because of the brand, but because the fatigue found them defenseless at the sink that night. Rowan said he didn\u2019t want to keep being a headline and Bart said no one wants to be a headline unless they control the font, and Rowan told him he sounded like someone trying to therapize instead of love, and Bart told him he was being asked not to be honest by a man who had built a career out of honesty with his legs. The fight had old shapes\u2014the moment when a voice rises and you watch yourself from the corner of the room and choose whether to be better than your reflexes, the moment when one person goes quiet not to win but to keep the roof on. They stopped themselves in the middle like a hand on a stove and Rowan swore and put his forehead to the cabinet and Bart stepped into him until they were a stupid statue. \u201cIf you do it, I will take the pictures off my route,\u201d Bart said, and made a stupid face to blunt the sincerity. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, I will make fun of the shoes anyway.\u201d\n\nNationals came up like a dare and the train got him there, because driving into a city with track energy is a way to resent everything for no good reason. The hotel was a vertical collection of nervous systems. The lobby smelled like instant coffee and cologne and ambition. Call room staff moved with the serene bureaucracy of people who could break your day for a living and choose not to. Bart shook hands with men he had spent winters resenting and summers warming up next to, and they all pretended time wasn\u2019t weird. Rinaldi issued instructions with the calm of a man performing mouth-to-mouth on panic. Tess texted a photograph of a crooked picture frame in her new hallway and a note that said, \u201cI\u2019m going to leave it like this forever. Do well.\u201d\n\nRowan warmed up on the outer ring with rhythms that had learned not to accelerate without permission. His eyes had decided to be selfish, tracking only what they needed. He ran past Bart without stopping and without avoiding and the small movement of a hand flicked acknowledgment, their language for not making a scene where a scene would be a lie. When his heat got called, he shook his arms out like they\u2019d been asked to stand for too long in one position and took the rail like he wasn\u2019t apologizing to it. The gun was a question mark turned sideways and then the field became an answer he could tolerate. He sat fifth and then sixth and then fifth again. The last lap was that place where you have to pick which version of yourself to honor. He didn\u2019t win and he didn\u2019t fall apart. He ended with enough left in him to hate that fact for a second and then forgive it. The time was clean and human. The bowed heads on the finish line belonged to men he had to share breath with and he did.\n\nBy the rails, when the wave of sound had receded to a measurable number of decibels, Bart found him and gave him water and didn\u2019t say the sentence he\u2019d rehearsed because it was wrong in his mouth. Rowan tipped his head back, mouth open, animal, and then looked at him with pupils like absolutions. \u201cI didn\u2019t check for you,\u201d he said, as if confessing something huge. \u201cI ran and then I was done, and I liked being done, and I liked knowing you were here like furniture. I mean that as a compliment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take furniture,\u201d Bart said. \u201cI want to be a lamp.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Rowan said, and laughed a noise that shook something out of his chest. \u201cYou already are. One-two-three-four\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFive-six,\u201d Bart finished, and they didn\u2019t make it into something cute because it already was and they let it be.\n\nAfter his own heat, after a qualifying time that landed him with the precise satisfaction of a correct diagnosis, after the shower that felt like absolution and the black coffee that tasted like penance, Bart found himself in a corridor with a wall of glass that turned the outside trees into a watercolor. He leaned his head to the cool and watched strangers do the kinds of small kindnesses you only notice when you are not being asked for anything\u2014someone held a door with their foot because their hands were full, someone handed over a hair elastic without asking for it back, two men laughed and pretended they hadn\u2019t. He was tired only in the body in the way that matters, the mind left free to wander without malicious intent. When Rowan stepped into his peripheral, he didn\u2019t even have to look up. It felt like the hours after a storm when you realize the roof held.\n\nThey promised, and kept, one night without any talk of times or lattices of grief. They walked a couple of anonymous blocks and found a Greek place with a blue sign and a waiter who cared exactly enough. They ate lamb with their fingers and let oil baptize their knuckles. They argued gently about whether oregano is a bully. They watched an old couple share a plate and the old man\u2019s hand hover near his wife\u2019s wrist like there was still something urgent to catch. They tried very hard not to talk about what their old would look like and failed quietly in complementary ways. Back in the hotel lobby, an athlete in a black hoodie asked for a photo with Rowan without asking for permission for the person standing next to him to have a life, and Rowan put his arm around a stranger in the practiced way and Bart moved to the side and didn\u2019t take offense at his own invisibility because he had chosen it.\n\nSeptember began to consider whether it had earned a reputation yet. The heat backed off and the city remembered it owned sweaters. The barista switched the chalkboard to a maple latte and scowled at Bart like it was his fault. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, and she said, \u201cGood.\u201d At the warehouse, schedules went back to something like routine, which was almost suspicious. Monique started saying winter prep like she was casting a spell. Rinaldi made noises about base like other men say taxes and got out a spreadsheet he would pretend was a napkin. Tess hung the crooked frame and refused to fix it, and when their mother visited she pretended not to notice and then confessed she liked it better wrong.\n\nThe fund board had its first argument in earnest, which Rowans discovered meant it was a real board. They disagreed over whether to spend money fast where it would be seen or slowly where it would work invisibly. The cardigan woman wanted ten smaller projects to reduce harm in ten places so people would look up and realize not dying is an infrastructure choice. A man with a good tie wanted one new mid-block crossing with everyone\u2019s names on it. Rowan recused himself from some of the smiling and then put his hand up in the way he had learned to, and said he didn\u2019t know how to write his name on anything without making a lie, but he could live with a plaque that listed only verbs. He suggested three words that made him want to die a little when he heard them in his own voice: look, slow, yield. Bart, sitting in the back with a notepad, wrote them down with the tenderness you usually reserve for the way someone you love pronounces a difficult word.\n\nThere was the day Rowan called from a parking lot because he had outlasted his first panic since therapy, and triumphed by not trying to wrestle it into anything heroic. He said it had arrived like weather and departed like weather and in between he had sat in his car and noticed the stitching on the steering wheel. He told Bart he had counted the stitches and they had helped. Bart told him he liked that the world was literally sewn and then apologized for how earnest he sounded, and Rowan said, \u201cI can handle your earnestness as long as I never have to see your poetry.\u201d They laughed in the same key and a woman walking her dog outside the car looked in with a brief, polite curiosity like she\u2019d just spotted birds.\n\nRinaldi\u2019s coat came off one afternoon in a gesture Bart had not witnessed in a decade. It was not an omen, just a concession to warmth. Underneath he was a man built out of stories and the tired violence of delicious food. He called Bart to the bench at the end of a workout while the geese negotiated a treaty with teenagers over the use of the grass. He said the words assistant and stipend and spring in an order that felt like an invitation across a threshold Bart hadn\u2019t known he had been standing at. He said he didn\u2019t make assistants because it was work to make a person permanent, and he said he would make Bart one for the winter if Bart wanted to find out whether being responsible for other people\u2019s breathing made him feel bigger or smaller. Bart answered like he answers the only questions that matter\u2014smiling without showing teeth and saying yes, and then admitting he was scared of anything that added the word always to his life.\n\nThey told Rowan\u2019s mother, and it felt like a small mountain that had never been on any map. It was a simple call on a Sunday, sunlight making bars on the floor between his bed and the wall. She asked him if he was eating enough because that is the way she knows to open most doors with him, and he said yes, and then he said he had someone who made him eat when he forgot and he heard her make a soft sound in the hinge of her mouth that let him picture her hand finding her throat like she wanted to keep all her careful words from falling out. She asked his name and then said it twice, measuring it, and then asked if he wanted to tell his father whom she called later because parents still have their own marriages even when their children take up all the light. It was not a coming out so much as a coming into, and he found that his lungs had been making a fist for too long and could relax now that they were being watched for something other than performance.\n\nThey went to a small town meet in October because runners are ridiculous and so are their calendars. The field smelled like apples from an invisible tart at a concession stand and the track had a crack in lane eight that made purists suck their teeth. Rowan did tempo work in lane two because the rhythm wanted him and not the other way around. Bart stood with a stopwatch and pretended it mattered. He shouted splits like a man in a movie and Rowan stuck out his tongue on the third rep to make him laugh and almost tripped because even joy makes you vulnerable. After, they sat on the grass and watched kids learn how to throw javelins wrong and then right, and watched a coach tell a kid\u2019s mother how long it would take to see if this was a thing and not just an afternoon. Bart leaned back on his elbows and let the season lay down next to him with a little sigh.\n\nWhen the cold came for real, it brought with it the quiet that makes conversation less necessary and more precise. They put away shorts and pretended to like beanies and rediscovered the athletic beauty of socks. The noodle shop downstairs started serving a stew as if they were apologizing on behalf of the air. Bart began to carry a coaching notebook with him that acquired the exact right amount of grease on the cover. Rowan bought a lamp at a thrift store because it was ugly and therefore no one would want it, and because the shade made the room look like someone had thought about where the light ought to sit. He sent Bart a photograph of the bulb waking the shade and typed, One-two-three-four, and Bart wrote back, Five-six-seven-eight, and neither of them decided that made them corny.\n\nThe first snow arrived like a dare and an apology. They ran anyway, because this is the contract, and the sound underfoot changed into the interesting squeak that tells you something about traction you cannot make useful. The geese left reluctantly and one stayed behind because it had a lot to say. Tess hosted what she called an adult party and which was actually chili and a playlist and three kinds of seltzer; their parents came and sat on the couch like people visiting a museum exhibit about their children\u2019s adulthood. Ben and Rowan stood on the balcony for a minute too long, two men whose bodies had learned similar disciplines in different languages. Ben told him some small true thing about breathing at the blue line and Rowan told him some small true thing about the first two hundred meters in the cold and they were pleased with each other for not lying.\n\nOn a night when the rink at Victoria Park had not yet opened and the lamps looked like they might consider their reflection, Bart brought Rowan to the bridge and counted in his head because the habit was a form of prayer he could do in front of another person without embarrassing himself. They stood hip to hip and said nothing for the kind of long that belongs to people who are not afraid of silence. Somewhere in the dark a kid laughed the way kids do when a parent lets them stay up late for no good reason. Rowan shoved his hands deeper into his pockets and then took one out and looked at it like he had found it in a coat he didn\u2019t know he owned. He threaded his fingers through Bart\u2019s, palm to palm, and it felt like the kind of grip you use to pull someone up a hill and not let go until they\u2019re over the lip.\n\nLater, in the kitchen, Rowan found the only good knife without looking and cut an orange in quarters with the competence of a man who has few kitchen skills and treats those he has like medals. He handed Bart a slice and it ran down their wrists and they shivered and laughed and then the radio played some song that had survived a decade of being played badly at weddings, and Bart said, \u201cWe\u2019re doing fine,\u201d and Rowan said, \u201cWe are.\u201d They ate the rest of the orange in a silence that was full of yeses and small, unshowy promises, and when they went to bed they let their feet find each other first because it seemed modest to start at the edge and work in.\n\nWinter was a new training block and also a new house rule. They made soup and missed workouts and made them up and did not bother to count. Rinaldi taught him how to teach high knees to freshmen who wanted to skip steps and wanted the end without the drill and Bart learned how to watch an ankle the way you watch a sentence for where it wants to break. Rowan learned how to sleep again in a body that did not clutch itself all night to avoid falling. Tess learned that the crooked frame made her mother itch and kept it anyway. The fund built two crossings and a mural with verbs, and the cardigan woman cried without making a scene when she saw a kid push a button with severe ceremony. The lights at Gaukel got a new sign that said, thanks, and no one could agree on for what, which felt like the right lack of consensus.\n\nOne morning, before the sky had decided to be anything at all, Bart woke because a horn sounded far away like it was in his childhood. He lay there and watched the shape of the apartment change as the streetlight did its slow cycle, and he thought about last winter\u2019s man, that version of himself who had not known about the shape of a stranger\u2019s hand and the particular ache behind his own right knee that was grief and not injury. He thought of the way Rowan looked at a finish line like it was a gate that required a specific password this time only he knew. He thought of how he would teach a kid to trust their toes again. He thought of little things he could do that weren\u2019t little\u2014answer the phone, eat the eggs, lace the shoe, walk to the lights and wait like a person who has time.\n\nHe got up and put the kettle on long before the noodle shop downstairs would consider opening, and he stood in the kitchen with cold on his ankles and listened to the apartment stretch. Rowan rolled, a dark collection of vowels under the duvet, and muttered something about eight that sounded like a promise to no one in particular. Bart poured water and then turned and leaned on the counter and watched the lamp across the room be itself. He counted under his breath because old prayers keep you company even when you learn new ones. One-two-three-four. He stopped and looked up toward the shape in the bed, and the shape reached one hand out into the light as if pulled by a tide. Five-six-seven-eight. He said it aloud to a room that had not asked for it, and then he went about his morning, which was sometimes the bravest thing he knew how to do.",

                              "content": "Bart ran down King Street before the sun knew it was late. The Ion slid past like a thought he couldn\u2019t hold, windows full of bleary faces and the ghost of yesterday\u2019s rain. He had a rule about mornings: if he beat the buses out, if his laces were tied before the baker on Duke flicked on his orange lamps, he could pretend the city was his to move through, not something pressing down on him. The air smelled like wet brick and coffee. It would be a good day for his legs, he told them, even though they didn\u2019t talk back and he would\u2019ve been worried if they did.\n\nHe cut down toward Victoria Park, skirting the geese with the caution of a man who\u2019s learned that geese have no respect for athletes, Canadian or not. The path slicked under his shoes, that whisper of rubber on damp stone that could make a body feel fast without actually being fast. He liked that lie. He ran toward the bandstand and then out toward the bridge, counting river lamps because numbers didn\u2019t argue. One-two-three-four, flicker, five-six.\n\nCoach Rinaldi said the mornings were for base mileage, his gravel voice making mileage sound like something you poured into a tank. \u201cYou can\u2019t sprint on empties,\u201d Rinaldi liked to say, and then he would drink his coffee like he\u2019d said something new this time, and Bart would nod because people should be allowed to enjoy their old lines. He\u2019d been nodding since he was ten, since the first time he ran a charity 5K and felt like his lungs had learned a word he wasn\u2019t ready to say out loud.\n\nThe city never left him alone. Not entirely. It snagged at his shorts in the form of rambunctious dogs, it tugged at his ear with the bells on streetcars that weren\u2019t technically streetcars. It whispered to him on the backs of benches: City of Kitchener Summer Events\u2014Live at the Square every Friday. He had grown up in the shadow of big hockey. The Rangers\u2019 jerseys hung in the windows of pubs and dentists alike. His father, Ben, had a 1990s poster of a goalie masked in his living room, his personal religious icon. But Bart had barely learned to skate. He\u2019d found his own arena, with lane lines painted on it and coaches who told you your worth in intervals.\n\n\u201cBack before sunrise, Bart?\u201d A runner he knew from the club raised a hand and then vanished into the trees. The city ate people like that.\n\nBack home, his apartment over the noodle shop smelled of broth no one asked him to cook. Fresh posters of the Athletics Ontario circuit were taped on the wall, curling at the edges like they were trying to wave. The top one was a meet flyer: Guelph Alumni Stadium, Mid-Spring 1500m Classic, a petty little name for a petty little field that seemed to include every man who\u2019d beaten him by half a step since high school. A bold-font face stared from the lower right: Rowan Keane, defending champion. A collection of pixels that somehow made a mouth he already hated and eyes he pretended not to register.\n\nHe\u2019d known Rowan\u2019s name too long to forget it the way he forgot other athletes\u2019 names. At first it had just been a shape in the results. K. Keane (GUEL) 3:42.89. Later it was a shoulder ahead of him at the bell, an elbow that did not forgive and did not forget. Rinaldi called Rowan \u201cthe exact measure of where you need to be,\u201d like the man was a ruler, a totem, a stick with notches. Bart called him something else in his head, something ruder and shorter and made of syllables that felt like punching a wall. Arch enemy fell out of his mouth once, as a joke, and Tess, his sister, had laughed too hard and then looked more closely than he liked. \u201cArch, like you\u2019re in a comic book,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cDo you have a cape? Spikes aren\u2019t capes, buddy.\u201d\n\nNow, showered and fed because he did the basic things to keep alive, he stood in front of the flyer and dared the paper to scare him. His phone vibrated on the counter.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d Tess said without hello. He pictured her in the kitchen of their parents\u2019 house, a smear of jam on her elbow, a plant growing too well in the background. Twenty-two, opinionated as a cat.\n\n\u201cWhat gave it away,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sun or the sweating?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re running out of jokes. Mom wants to know if you\u2019re coming for dinner. Wednesday. Dad\u2019s on his chili.\u201d A pause. \u201cAlso, I saw a thing about Rowan on the University\u2019s page. He\u2019s doing some\u2014like a community clinic? Signing autographs. He\u2019s got a\u2026 hair situation now. Too branded.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about his hair,\u201d Bart said immediately, and then: \u201cWhat clinic?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing when you get coy. Hey, I gotta go. Tell coach R to hydrate. You know how he gets that prune look.\u201d\n\nAs if echo, he looked at his own face in the kettle\u2019s curve. A blur that looked awake and tired and something in between. He named the things he would do. He would run the morning mileage. He would go to his shift at the warehouse on Shirley, stacking boxes that politely suggested they had souls. He would stop on the way back to pick up new tape because his right ankle had decided to remember January\u2019s sprain. He would not look too long at Rowan\u2019s picture, and he would not google the words \u201cRowan Keane clinic Kitchener Guelph rivalry\u201d because that was beneath him. That\u2019s what he told himself, but then his thumb was already walking across the letters.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t in Kitchener. It was in Guelph, alumni stadium, Saturday morning, an hour after the junior heats. A meet plus clinic, to bring the community in. He imagined a little Rowan on a folding chair talking to kids, sealing their dreams with a pen. He closed the tab. He opened it again. He closed it finally and laughed aloud at nothing, at a ceiling he knew by heart.\n\nRinaldi had texted at 5:30 a.m. like always. \u201cTwo by six by four hundred. Short rec. Put the watch away. Listen.\u201d On the track, listening is a talent. Bart thought he had it. Not like music. Like hearing the softness of your footfalls and knowing when you\u2019re lying to yourself about how hard you\u2019re pushing.\n\nHe got to the track when the student joggers cleared. It wasn\u2019t his, it was a community oval half a mile from his apartment, a rough red ring. Rinaldi was already there in a coat too big for a man who\u2019d never grown into it. He wore the coat year-round. Maybe it had a heart inside it he needed to keep warm.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d Rinaldi said, as if stating the facts might keep them on his side.\n\n\u201cI tried leaving, but the path turned into a treadmill,\u201d Bart said. \u201cMagic.\u201d\n\nRinaldi\u2019s smile was a sidelong thing. \u201cGood. Warm up.\u201d Then, later: \u201cThe Guelph meet. Obviously. I signed you up.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d Bart said, pretending the word did not mean I have been thinking of nothing else for days.\n\n\u201cAnd you won\u2019t get distracted by that boy\u2019s theatrics?\u201d\n\nBart shook out his legs. \u201cYou\u2019ll be pleased to know I am a man of iron focus.\u201d He lifted his knees. \u201cI do not know who or what you are talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeane. You two make every race look like a bank robbery.\u201d Rinaldi squinted past him, to where the short hurdle carts were sleeping. \u201cHe runs the way geese fight. All noise and then suddenly teeth. Don\u2019t watch him. Make him watch you.\u201d\n\nAnd in some unkind corner of himself, Bart said, Make him watch me even when he doesn\u2019t want to.\n\nThe reps went. The first set felt like the opening of a doorway on a day you didn\u2019t trust it to open. The second was a bench you couldn\u2019t choose, either splinters or cold metal. He finished every four hundred like he could swallow the air and it would save him. Rinaldi clapped quietly, the sound of small thunder.\n\n\u201c3:42 needs 60s,\u201d the coach said, an equation like a prayer. \u201cYou can touch that if you stop hating your last two steps. You have a memory like a dog, kid. You keep going back to the place that hurt you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not hate,\u201d Bart told him, lying because sometimes you have to put salt on the morning.\n\nAfter, he collapsed against the fence and let the winter-spring sun do its insufficient best. He watched a teenager skip the last forty meters of her own rep and sulk when her coach noticed. The place swarmed with stories and he could hear them if he wanted. He was not in any of them. Not yet, not in the kind of way that stuck.\n\nHe went to the warehouse and lived the neat version of himself there. He navigated between stacks that rattled when he touched them. His supervisor, a woman named Monique with purple glasses and arms that looked carved from stair rails, said, \u201cYou look pale today. You need a pastry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to stop running,\u201d he returned automatically, and they both laughed because they loved the lie, it made them feel like regular people.\n\nDuring lunch he ate without tasting. A coworker scrolled through his phone at the same table, video sound too loud until someone told him to stop. The phone showed Rowan being Rowan, half an interview in a locker room that wasn\u2019t technically a locker room. \u201cWhat\u2019s your mindset for the season?\u201d a reporter asked. \u201cFast,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cFaster.\u201d The camera caught his mouth in the act of conceding nothing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty,\u201d Monique said, casual, not knowing any of the blood under Bart\u2019s skin. \u201cLike an arrow. I like arrows. They get to the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t start,\u201d Bart muttered, but he watched the video anyway, because there are dances your mind leads you into even as you say no no no.\n\nBy Thursday, the wind was full of intentions, biting and soft. He stopped in at the coffee place on his corner\u2014Barker & Grain, chalkboard specials, the same barista who always pretended the beans had something to say about life. She wore a beanie and a scowl and she liked Bart better when he sweated. Today he was in the no-man\u2019s-land between. He asked for a long black. She gave him a short one and a grin like they were sharing a joke about the definition of long.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to Guelph, right,\u201d she said, not a question.\n\n\u201cGood to see I have no privacy within a two-kilometer radius of my house,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNone. If you win, we put a picture of you up next to the latte art failures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are sacred.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen run sacred. Also\u2014watch the intersection at Gaukel,\u201d she said, an odd non sequitur. \u201cThey did something to the lights. It\u2019s like chaos threw up down there.\u201d\n\nHe blinked. \u201cIs that your way of keeping me alive?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone has to. You look like a person who would get absorbed into a red hand and not notice.\u201d\n\nHe went. He didn\u2019t get hit by anything that morning. The light at Gaukel did not eat him. If it had, maybe the world would have rearranged itself in a more comprehensible way. It didn\u2019t. He ran. He went back to work. He ate his mother\u2019s chili that evening and told his father yes, he\u2019d sit through the second period of the game, yes, he\u2019d cheer for the home team, no, he would not admit the ref was biased. After nine, he stood in front of the downstairs bathroom mirror and watched the steam gather on the edges of his face. It made the world a little kinder. He wiped a path through.\n\nOn Friday, the last day before the clash he wouldn\u2019t call a clash, he jogged it out and pretended the track was a place where nothing changed. Rinaldi stood by the start line like a statue erected to stubbornness.\n\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d Rinaldi asked.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie so much you start believing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bart said again, because he didn\u2019t know another answer.\n\nHe saw him first on the warm-up loop. Guelph\u2019s Alumni Stadium was a bowl with aspirations, bleachers that had been promised more backs than they got. The turf glowed unnaturally, a green that didn\u2019t exist in nature but was voted least irritating by a committee. The sky held its own breath. Athletes milled. The scent of Tiger Balm was stronger than religion.\n\nRowan came down the back stretch with a loose-limbed, we-are-all-fine trot. He was easy to recognize even if you wished otherwise. Something about the economy of him. The way he ran like the world was an argument he had already won. He had that hair Tess had mocked\u2014rumpled but styled to look like he hadn\u2019t tried, a glass of water pretending it had never been poured.\n\nBart didn\u2019t look. Or he did, in the way you look at a lit window when you\u2019re walking past. He noted the sinew of underarms, the particular city of shin. He let the data pass through him as if that would make it harmless.\n\nThey mingled. They stretched in their own corners. The announcer made noises into the mic as if it were a reluctant animal. The junior heats were finishing and the kids ran with faces that would be photographs later. Some of them wore their school sweaters to warm up. Some of them more talent than sense. Bart sat on the cool rubber and tugged at his laces, pulling them tight and then tighter, a ritual of control.\n\n\u201cKW Flyers,\u201d a voice said above his shoulder. It carried a smile you couldn\u2019t see. \u201cIs that still a bird or did you all change it to a lightning bolt when I wasn\u2019t looking?\u201d\n\nHe knew the voice before he even had to raise his head. He turned as if the motion had weight to it and found Rowan standing not quite too close, chewing a piece of gum like a man with nothing to prove to gum. His eyes were green that day, or they were brown pretending green. They did that. Faces were liars. He was taller than the rumor of him and softer, somehow, and not soft at all.\n\n\u201cStill a bird,\u201d Bart said. \u201cWe try not to let branding change us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d Rowan said, and laughed at himself, which threw Bart\u2019s heart out of step for a second. \u201cKeane,\u201d he added, as if there could be doubt. He stuck out a hand, mock-polite. Bart stared at it longer than necessary and shook. Touch like a live wire you weren\u2019t sure you could let go of without pretending it hadn\u2019t hurt.\n\n\u201cBart,\u201d he said, because he forgot to say his last name sometimes, because he wanted to believe the rest of him was implied.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Rowan said. The words came too easily. \u201cYou cut down too fast from six hundred in Sudbury last month. Rinaldi teach you that? He\u2019s always liked tricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your coach likes\u2014what? Majesty?\u201d\n\n\u201cMisery,\u201d Rowan said, not even blinking. \u201cBut the nice kind.\u201d\n\nThey could have left it there. They didn\u2019t. They looked at each other like the whole stadium had narrowed to a point between them. The noise of beeps and whistles slid off. Rowan\u2019s lip did a thing that had probably sold many, many shoes.\n\n\u201cI like your form,\u201d Rowan said, surprising the lie right out of Bart\u2019s throat.\n\n\u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clean. It makes me nervous,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cSometimes, not always. Don\u2019t let that go to your head. But it\u2019s like the clear part of a river that just turns into rocks with no warning. I like that. Secret violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour compliments are weird,\u201d Bart said, and found himself smiling, real as the cold.\n\n\u201cYour elbows are weirder,\u201d Rowan returned. \u201cHey. Good luck today.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend to be nice. It doesn\u2019t fit you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what fits me.\u201d Rowan paused, and something passed between them that had nothing to do with spikes or laps. \u201cYet.\u201d\n\nBart stared after him when he went. He made himself stop. He went through the last drills by the book. A-skips, B-skips, high knees, butt kicks, the little show your body performs to convince itself it can do this again. The starters called them to the line. Fourteen men with the same intention, wearing different faces. Bart felt the track collect under his feet like a promise. Rowan took the inside. Bart had lane three but he told himself that wasn\u2019t symbolic. He did not live in symbols. He lived in flesh and heartbeats.\n\nThe gun did not sound like war. It sounded like the day being split.\n\nFirst lap: caution, the accord of the field finding its groove. He smelled sweat and fear and the peppermint someone had forgotten to swallow. He had a plan. He would sit two back and then float. He would not chase. He would not let the race become something other people did to him.\n\nNine hundred: the world narrowed. He heard Rinaldi\u2019s voice, not words, just the shape of that gravel. He heard his own breath, louder than he wanted. He saw the back of Rowan\u2019s jersey and the cut from a number pin and wanted to put his fingers there. He wanted to take the bit in his mouth and run.\n\nBell: the bell. A thin brass circle that reduced men. He had the kick or he didn\u2019t. He went. He did not listen to anything that told him to wait. He moved to shoulder, then shoulder again, then his hand brushed Rowan\u2019s hand and it might have been an accident. It wasn\u2019t. They were alive in the way you get to be once or twice in a month if you\u2019re lucky.\n\nOne hundred to go: the mind begins to lie. It tells you what you deserve and what you don\u2019t. Bart\u2019s knees came up like he\u2019d always been running on his toes, like he had been ready for this without knowing. Rowan\u2019s breath was a noise. The line loomed stupid and huge and then they were there, throwing themselves at it like people do at gods.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t know in the first second after the line. He stumbled and caught himself on his hands and then Rinaldi was pounding him on the back and the announcer mispronounced his last name and then got it right and then he knew. He had won. He had beat Rowan by a thing smaller than the amount of faith he usually optimistically put aside, but he had beat him.\n\nThe wild thing wasn\u2019t the winning. The wild thing was Rowan\u2019s face when they were both back on two feet. He expected knives. He expected a thrown elbow without the deniability of the pack. He got instead something that looked like relief and then a twist of something like, approximating, almost\u2026 pride?\n\n\u201cYou took it,\u201d Rowan said, voice rougher than his hair. \u201cYou actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bart said. His chest was breaking in and out like a house in wind. \u201cYou didn\u2019t let me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I did,\u201d Rowan shot back, but it landed without malice. \u201cDon\u2019t make a habit.\u201d\n\nBart wanted to say something generous. Or cruel. Or both. Instead, he said, \u201cAre you doing your clinic after this?\u201d\n\nRowan blinked at him, thrown sideways by the pivot. \u201cYeah. Why.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause\u2026,\u201d Bart began, and didn\u2019t know the end of his sentence. \u201cBecause I want to watch how you talk to kids like you were never one.\u201d\n\nRowan\u2019s laugh startled them both. \u201cStay. If Rinaldi doesn\u2019t tie you to a post and make you jog for forty more minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if he does.\u201d\n\nThey stood there in the heap of their exhaustion and looked at each other as if they were studying a language that was not spoken lines on a page but the way someone tilted their chin, the way sweat carved a map. He could have touched Rowan again, for scientific reasons. He did not. Rinaldi called, and Rowan lifted his hand like a boy at a window and walked away.\n\nAfter the cool-down\u2014which Bart performed like a man pretending to be a runner in a play\u2014he stood by the chain-link and watched the clinic begin. The kids sat, cross-legged, a sprawl of bright shoes. Rowan perched on the edge of a high jump mat and spoke with a kind of lightness Bart had never seen in him. He told them about patience, which seemed unfair and a little funny. He told them about running ugly when you had to, about the art in ugly, about not waiting for the perfect day because it had other plans. He made a kid laugh. He made a parent lean in. He looked up once, and his gaze found Bart through the fence like it knew where he was when he was anywhere.\n\n\u201cDo you want to get coffee?\u201d The words were in Bart\u2019s mouth before he wanted them there. He waited until Rowan wasn\u2019t being watched by small humans. He waited and then the waiting hurt too much.\n\nRowan glanced at the time, as if his body kept one. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to,\u201d he said, a little rueful. \u201cBut I want to.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t happen then, because people wanted to take pictures, and a grandmother introduced Rowan to a grandson as if she were presenting the boy to a medium and asking for a future not too cruel. It happened an hour later, at a terrible caf\u00e9 near campus with low ceilings and high prices, where the barista wrote Rowan\u2019s name on a cup like a curse and spelled it wrong anyway. They sat, two men who had tried to take each other apart by inches, and sipped coffee that tried to take them apart from the inside.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not what I thought,\u201d Bart said eventually, when he\u2019d run out of lines to rehearse.\n\n\u201cWho were you practicing me as?\u201d Rowan asked.\n\n\u201cYou know. The enemy.\u201d\n\nRowan considered his cup as if it might give him a line. \u201cI\u2019ve never been anyone\u2019s enemy,\u201d he said eventually, and the lie was small but dense. \u201cUnless I have. You\u2019ve been in my way for years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the same as knowing me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think you could?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I already do,\u201d Bart lied, because it would be the worst thing to admit that he was already lost in the outline of a jaw.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Rowan said, and pointed at him with the corner of his lid, \u201care trouble. You feel like a bad decision I want to make.\u201d\n\nIt felt like being picked out of a line. It felt like the warm part in a cold room. If a person can be velocity, that\u2019s what Rowan was across the table, that hum of effort even when sitting absolutely still. Bart found himself listing the things that made him a human being\u2014childhood bedroom with dinosaur wallpaper beneath teen posters, the dog he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring to races, the scar on his calf from the first time he thought he could hurdle\u2014and none of it mattered as much as the way Rowan watched him, the friendly murder in it.\n\nThey walked back to the car park like a joke about normal people. Bart\u2019s little ten-year hatchback with the back seat that whistled. Rowan\u2019s slightly flashier, unexpectedly modest black sedan that didn\u2019t say anything. They stood there in a square of shade and the city moved around them and nobody knew them. Then Rowan stepped in, and everything fell a notch closer.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Rowan said at the last second, before anything had even happened. \u201cI can\u2019t do\u2014this. I have to go. I want to. It\u2019s just.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to go,\u201d Bart said, relieved and scorched at once. \u201cI get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to win,\u201d Rowan said, and then made a face that was half apology. \u201cYou do something to my head that I don\u2019t entirely\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSame,\u201d Bart returned. \u201cWhich is inconvenient.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can be inconvenient later,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cWe have tomorrow. Or the day after. Don\u2019t mess up your recovery. Don\u2019t hate me if I do a job on you next time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Bart lied. \u201cMaybe. Probably.\u201d\n\nRowan\u2019s hand hovered and then fell. He stepped back, half a foot, a full story. \u201cGo home,\u201d he told Bart softly. \u201cBe careful at those stupid lights.\u201d\n\nHe left with his stride that went through walls. Bart stood by his hatchback and watched him go and hated him, a little. Loved him, a little. Kept his hands to himself because the air was the only thing in reach. He went home to Kitchener in the grey hour where the highway felt like one long apology. The radio announced weather where there wasn\u2019t any worth announcing. A billboard told him to sign up for something that would improve his life by twenty-nine percent. He could feel the shape of Rowan\u2019s absence in the car like a third seat.\n\nAt home, the noodle shop sent up a steam prayer. He set his bag down like he was someone who didn\u2019t want it to fall. He showered like a human being pretending to be better than an animal and made eggs that tasted like triumph with an aftertaste of salt he hadn\u2019t put in. He texted Tess a sandblasted picture of the finish with a caption that read: 3:42.61. She sent back seventeen emojis that did not include the right one. He texted Rinaldi a single thumbs-up because that was their love language. He did not text Rowan, because he did not have Rowan\u2019s number. He did not have anything but the knowing and the wanting and the way his chest flickered like a light at the end of its cord.\n\nLater, after the longer hum of the city\u2019s Saturday night had dimmed, he stood by the window and watched himself reflected in the darkness. He tried to imagine explaining this to himself in language that wouldn\u2019t make him blush. He could not. He slept badly and woke early, which was his trick.\n\nHe returned to the rhythm. He went to work and stacked boxes and thought of nothing. He ran on trails he could map in his sleep and this time he kept his eyes where they were supposed to be. He had told himself his life would not be changed by winning once. He had told himself that about other things and had been wrong before. He went to a Sunday market with Tess and pretended to consider a handmade wooden spoon with the concentration of a surgeon.\n\n\u201cStop staring into space,\u201d she said, and pressed a rind of cheese to his lips. \u201cEat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d he said, around the rind. \u201cI have been. I will.\u201d He loved Tess best when she bossed him. He loved her less when she said, too knowing, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go and make google eyes at your arch nemesis, at least try to protect your heart a little? I like it. It\u2019s not a toy.\u201d\n\nHe made a face, because that was their other language. \u201cHe\u2019s not my enemy. He\u2019s just\u2014a person. Who has a certain way of moving. That makes a person curious.\u201d\n\n\u201cA certain way of moving,\u201d she repeated, delighted and cruel. \u201cGross. Do you want me to leave you alone with the concept of shoulders?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me five minutes.\u201d\n\nHe waited for the ground to change its tilt. He waited for the world to reveal the trick, or a trapdoor. Instead: Monday. Then Tuesday. Rowan existed in his phone in the places that were supposed to be for news. Rinaldi looked at him like he didn\u2019t trust how light Bart\u2019s steps were, as if he would float away and stop doing the beast work of running. The lights at Gaukel stayed weird, but he learned them.\n\nWednesday he walked to work past the bookstore that pretended it didn\u2019t sell only gifts, and saw a thin newspaper folded into the rack. A photo he recognized. Rowan at an awards dinner wearing a suit like someone else had arranged it on him. He didn\u2019t buy the paper. He stood and read the caption like a thief and then moved on, his heart a smaller thing.\n\nIn the nights after, he dreamt sometimes about the last hundred meters and sometimes about a parking lot. That these dreams were equally vivid unnerved him. He had always had the kind of brain that resisted softness. That was not true anymore. He stopped trying to make it true. He let his legs do that instead.\n\nWhen Rowan finally texted, because somehow of course he did, it was a number without a name. \u201cYou left your throat on the track,\u201d the message read. \u201cWant to grab it back?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is this,\u201d Bart typed, and then deleted it. \u201cWhere, when,\u201d he sent instead.\n\n\u201cWhere: Country Boy Eatery, by the highway. When: now-ish,\u201d came back. \u201cIf you\u2019re not there in twelve minutes I will say hateful things about you to the sugar packets.\u201d\n\nBart didn\u2019t tell Rinaldi. He told Tess, who texted: \u201cBring an umbrella, it\u2019s a weather day.\u201d He took his keys and left. He told himself it was just pancakes and mocking. It was, and then it wasn\u2019t. Country Boy was a place with sticky tables and the best kind of waitresses, the kind who could flip you onto your back with one eyebrow. Rowan had a booth at the back and was flipping a spoon like it had offended him. He saw Bart and his face did that lifting, that uncoiling that made another face inside it.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d Bart echoed, and it was both the first time and not even close.\n\nThey talked nonsense first. The food was deeply acceptable. Rowan made a pitch for the sanctity of bad coffee. Bart argued for eggs as religion. The waitress rolled her eyes and called them children. Their knees touched under the table by accident, then on purpose. They argued about form again. They argued about music. They found the rhythm of interrupting and not minding and then giving the floor back because it felt good to let the other person be smart. When he left, Rowan bumped his shoulder against Bart\u2019s in the parking lot like it was a sentence. He didn\u2019t end the sentence. He let it hang until the next day, and then again.\n\nThey made small allowances. They did not tell anyone who would understand too quickly. They kept to public places that felt private and to private places that they kept quiet. In the grocery store aisle on a Thursday night, Rowan picked up a can of tomatoes and read the label like it contained an escape route. \u201cI have to leave early Saturday,\u201d he said. \u201cCoach wants me at a road thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo don\u2019t come Friday,\u201d Bart said, back turned, like he could twist the burn into a stretch. He replaced a jar he didn\u2019t want. He overthought the peanut butter.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cI\u2019m coming Friday. I am not available to be rational on the subject of you.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, they kissed in the shadow of a tiny bridge in Victoria Park because it was the only place that felt like it could hold a beginning. Birdsound. Rubber on stone. A child\u2019s bicycle tossed aside. People not noticing because why would they. Rowan tasted like snowmelt and sugar. Or maybe that\u2019s not right. Maybe he tasted like the pause between pronouncing a sentence and understanding it. Bart stepped back because if he hadn\u2019t he would have fallen in.\n\nHe did not say love. He did not say anything believable. He said, \u201cAgain,\u201d and again happened, and then they walked separate ways because life remained a wide and complicated road and they had other obligations, sleepy ones, sharp ones. But his stomach was a wing. The city looked briefly like it had put on a new coat. Even the geese bowed, almost.\n\nOn Sunday, he brought Rowan to see Tess and the dog by accident, by not-checking, by wanting something, by a dozen small rebellions. Tess looked at Rowan like she was tasting water she didn\u2019t trust. Then she smiled and shook his hand, and the dog adored him instantly, which meant nothing and everything.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who runs like you\u2019re about to commit a crime,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGuilty,\u201d Rowan responded, a little shy, and that was a thing to put in a jar and keep for later.\n\nIt would have been easy, if anything in the world was. It would have been a path with firm little posts at the side, bolts in, caution, guardrail. Instead it was a tightrope stretched across days. Perfect for a runner, you might say. No. After a while you want ground. You want it to hold.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rowan canceled. On Wednesday it rained and Bart ran anyway, though his ankle nagged him with a voice he recognized. On Thursday, Rowan sent a photo of a plane wing and a thumbs-up. On Friday, Bart walked to Gaukel and did not look at the crosswalk any differently. On Saturday, the phone call came mid-morning, Rinaldi\u2019s name on the screen, which was odd. Rinaldi didn\u2019t call mid-morning. No one did, except maybe your kid or the bank.\n\n\u201cYou should turn on the news,\u201d Rinaldi said, his voice sand and smoke. \u201cYou should\u2014no, wait. Don\u2019t turn on the news. Tess is\u2014she\u2019s okay. She\u2019s okay. It wasn\u2019t here. It was in Guelph. A car. A child. He\u2014Keane. The boy. He didn\u2019t. It was an intersection. He. It was an accident, Bart. It was\u2014it was everything nobody deserved. They\u2019re saying. He\u2019s\u2014he\u2014\u201d\n\nBart stood, listening while Rinaldi tried to find a sentence that let everyone remain standing. He made out three facts and a hundred terrible shadows. Car. Child. Rowan. Accident. The words rattled and then swallowed themselves. The kettle in the kitchen had forgotten to boil and was trying again. The window held his reflection and below it the street. He could see the crosswalk down there, the place where the red hand had looked too much like a dare the other day. He could see the city, unchanged. He could not hear his breath.\n\n\u201cBart?\u201d Rinaldi said. It was a hard question. \u201cBart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said, and the words did not fit in his mouth the way they used to.\n\nThe kettle clicked off. The world did not. He took the phone to his ear with both hands. He listened while Rinaldi gave him the facts again, because facts are all you have when you don\u2019t have anything else.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to him,\u201d Bart said, without knowing if he could, if he should, if the doors of the world would let him through.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s\u2014if he even wants\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t want anything right now,\u201d Bart said. \u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d He laughed, a terrible small laugh that made the room colder. \u201cThat\u2019s all I have. Wanting nothing.\u201d\n\nHe put on his shoes without tying them properly and tied them. He remembered his keys this time. He left the house and the noodle smell and the poster curling on the wall and walked into a day that had every intention of continuing without him. He did not know where to go. He went anyway.",

                              "content": "He drove to Guelph without fully remembering how the decision turned into keys, how keys turned into ignition, how ignition turned into the same two lanes he always took when he needed a change of scenery that looked like the last one. The highway rose and fell as if reconsidering itself, and he threaded past a pickup truck carrying pallets, a sedan with a smiley face sticker that seemed indecently optimistic, a bus whose windows held reflections of people who didn\u2019t know what they would learn today. His hands remembered to keep the wheel steady even as his head flickered. He kept the radio off because he didn\u2019t want anyone else\u2019s voice claiming the air, and he kept the window cracked because he wanted the day to be allowed in even if it felt like a trespass. The thought formed and unformed that if he did not see the place with his own eyes it would remain an arrangement of syllables, and he could not have that; he needed the hard edge of curb and the angle of light and the ordinary ugliness of a pole with signs that told you how to behave.\n\nGuelph sat in its bowl that day, the sky a lid not convinced it wanted to press down. The Hanlon carried him north, and he cut across toward campus because his muscle memory pointed there, because if he didn\u2019t aim at something he\u2019d drift through the day and end up back where he\u2019d started without having touched the fact. The intersection announced itself before he saw it, a slow jam of cars becoming a knot of pedestrians becoming the soft boundary of police tape strung like ribbon from sign to sign. A cruiser idled under a tree that hadn\u2019t learned spring yet, and the light cycled dumbly, obedient to its program. There were cones. There were fluorescent vests. There were people holding their phones chest-high as if they might catch the event of healing on camera. There was a bike, small, laid down where it had been set aside by someone who didn\u2019t want to put it on its side but didn\u2019t know where else to put it. It had a bell and a scrap of ribbon like a wish.\n\nHe parked two streets over and walked, feeling like he had come to a house that would not let him in. The tape hummed in the lazy wind, a taut music that had lost its tune. He stood near a newspaper box and leaned his shoulder on it because his legs had decided that was the thing to do. A woman with a blue scarf told a man with a hat what she had heard, and the words slotted themselves into the air around him even though they were not intended for him. The light was green, she said, and then red, and then who could tell; sometimes the world chose its colors too fast. Someone said the child had a helmet. Someone said no, the helmet was in the backpack. Someone said the driver got out immediately. Someone said the driver looked like he knew how to run. Someone said he was famous, like that could help or hurt.\n\nBart looked away and then back, the way you might with an animal that could hurt you if you respected it too much. He took his phone out and put it back and took it out again, and this time he typed, because if he didn\u2019t type something he would stand there until dark. He wrote, \u201cWhere are you,\u201d and then erased it, and wrote, \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d and then erased that too because it sounded like a bad joke, because the word here had failed to hold any meaning in his mouth. He typed nothing and sent nothing and shoved the phone into his pocket as if it had tried to bite him. A boy in a black hoodie slipped under the tape with the smooth entitlement of youth and got two steps before a constable told him gently to go back. He did, and put his hands in his pockets like there might be a map to when this hadn\u2019t happened.\n\nHe walked around the block once and then twice, scuffing his shoe on places that looked like answers from some angles and like mockery from others. The smell of gasoline sat like a punctuation mark under the brighter notes of coffee and grass and the leftover onion from a food truck. A man who could have been in his fifties asked him if he had seen it and Bart said no and the man nodded like he had expected that answer and had prepared for it anyway. On the far corner he found the first hard sign of how the city would grieve\u2014a single flower, yellow, laid against the base of a streetlight that had no interest in flowers. The flower looked wrong there, like a hand placed on a stranger\u2019s back.\n\nHe did not know the hospital with the confidence of habit, but his location app did, and he let it guide him without looking like that was what he was doing. Guelph General sat low and stubborn, the sort of building that seemed to be doing work even when it was just watching its own doors. The parking lot was a low murmur of arrival and departure, the bumpers of cars holding the dust of other days. He found a spot and misjudged the lines and corrected himself and found the front desk and said a name that tasted like asking too much. The volunteer there had a pin shaped like a sun and eyes like someone who knew a hundred stories a day and kept them all to herself. She didn\u2019t wince when he said Rowan\u2019s name, and he wanted to thank her for that tiny mercy. She said she couldn\u2019t tell him anything but he could take a seat.\n\nThe waiting room was busy in the way of places that are always busy; it did not amplify his urgency because it had a supply of its own. He sat with his knees slightly apart and his elbows on them and his hands making a cradle he did not know what to carry in. A TV mounted by the ceiling did the thin unhelpful thing of rolling footage of the intersection he had just seen with his eyes, cutting to a headshot of Rowan from last spring where his smile looked like it had been told to occur. The chyron was a bad sentence written by someone working against time. He did not look away and he did not keep looking; he took in one frame and refused the next. On the far side of the room a child laughed at a cartoon on a tablet, the sound like a clear bell from the other side of a hill.\n\nHe texted Tess once he could make his fingers choose letters, and told her only that he was in Guelph and he was waiting and he was fine as far as he knew. She wrote back faster than he hoped she would, told him to eat something even if it tasted like cardboard, told him she was with Mom buying groceries and they would not turn on the TV until she said they could. He told her that sounded impossible and she said not if you hide the remote, which she had. He put the phone down and folded his hands again and then unfolded them because the action looked like prayer and he wasn\u2019t ready to commit to that for an audience.\n\nAfter a time that did not make sense, a man in a jacket with the team\u2019s colors on it stood in the hallway and looked like he did not want to be seen. He had the posture of someone who had aged out of sprint drills and into budgets, and his gaze hit the waiting room like a thing thrown at a wall. Bart stood without meaning to and the man saw him see him and there was a small private flinch that told Bart he was not wrong to be here. The man came over, and up close he was all coffee and beard and eyes that had forgotten sleep.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Bart,\u201d he said, and he did not make it a question because the world had given him enough today.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bart said, and he realized his voice had chosen the lower register it took when he spoke to coaches. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if this is\u2026 not useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing but useful,\u201d the man said, and his gratitude had a rough edge. \u201cHe asked for you. He\u2019s done being talked at by uniforms and strangers with microphones. He asked for you, and I told him if you were reading anything I\u2019d be giving you the wrong job description.\u201d\n\nIt was not a door to permission but it was near enough to count. They walked down a corridor that smelled like cleaning made into a religion, and the lights overhead flickered in the way of lights that are tired but would never admit it. He heard the click of his own steps and thought of spikes on track, of the small echo of speed, and wished he hadn\u2019t because that felt like a theft. They passed rooms with complicated chairs and rooms with machines that breathed for people and a room so empty it looked like a place where stories ended. When they reached Rowan there was no ceremony, just a curtain pulled aside and a chair that tried to be a bed and a face he knew that had lost its arguments.\n\nRowan looked at him like he had looked at the finish line, unprepared for what would be there when the blur stopped. His eyes had learned a new dullness that wasn\u2019t tiredness; it was the kind of thing that fell on you when someone turned out all the lamps in a house at once. He had a bandage on his hand and no other obvious harm, which would make his guilt worse. A nurse touched a gauge with two fingers and left as if she had practiced leaving before. The coach stood back like a wardrobe and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be in the hall,\u201d and closed himself into the corridor.\n\nFor a second they did nothing and that was the right thing. Bart\u2019s body did the calculations it needed to do to keep him upright in rooms where he wanted to crumple. Then he moved and sat in the chair that had not been placed there for him and his knees made a small noise that existed to prove he was alive. He said Rowan\u2019s name and it sounded like a word he had never tried on before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not real to me,\u201d Rowan said, and his voice was hoarse, scraped by the act of bargaining with the universe. \u201cAnd it is. It\u2019s both all the way. And I keep thinking if I put my hand out I\u2019ll feel it like a wall and then I\u2019ll know. But there isn\u2019t a wall. There\u2019s just\u2014air. I keep thinking I\u2019ll smell the\u2014what do you call it\u2014rubber, and the hot metal, and then I\u2019ll wake up. But I already smelled it. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d He lifted his bandaged hand too quickly and cursed at himself, at the room, at the light. \u201cThey keep telling me the things they tell everyone so that they can go home after their shift and not dream. They told me about reaction times. About intersections. About a witness who says he saw a\u2014some motion that you can\u2019t pin on anybody. About how green is not a shield and red is not murder. They told me words like no impairment and no charges at this time. I don\u2019t deserve any of their words.\u201d\n\nHe spoke like a runner breaking form at the end of a hard rep, the sentences spilling where they needed to be held. Bart let them spill because trying to catch them would only make a mess. He found that he had taken Rowan\u2019s wrist without remembering the movement, his thumb on the inside where pulse lives, because we are all animals who check the river when we pass it. The skin there was warm and dry and familiar. It did not resolve anything, which is not the same as being useless.\n\n\u201cDo you know about the\u2014about the kid,\u201d Bart asked, and he hated the question for having to be asked. He would have climbed inside it and taken it apart if he could.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t tell me more than wait,\u201d Rowan said, and the word broke, and he put his free hand over his face as if to keep it from falling apart. \u201cSomebody\u2019s mother screamed outside the taped bits. It had a pitch. You know how you can tell when a crowd is there for five hundred meters and when it\u2019s there for ten? The pitch changes. This had a pitch that was not designed for human throats. And I thought, that will be my brain forever. I thought, I\u2019ll take it if it means there\u2019s still something happening at the other end of it. That\u2019s not charity. That\u2019s\u2014what do you call it. Selfish hope.\u201d\n\nThe shape of hope changed in the room just because he named it. Bart put his elbows on his knees again and leaned in because leaning in was the motion that kept him closer to not falling out of his seat. He told Rowan about waiting in the lobby and not liking the TV and a woman\u2019s sun pin and how you can tell who is ready to give you bad news and who is trying to avoid being made into the shadow that delivers it. He told him he had gone to the intersection like a pilgrim and found nothing he could take back except the fact of it. He told him Tess had hidden the remote at home and would kill him for telling anyone. He told him nonsense on purpose, because nonsense is a language with weight when the words you would normally use have lost their muscle.\n\n\u201cWhat if I\u2019m the person who takes things from the world,\u201d Rowan said finally, and the fact that he could ask that without turning into ash should have counted as proof he wasn\u2019t. \u201cNot medals. Not times. Not wins. I mean the person who makes a line and whatever\u2019s on one side of the line falls into a hole, and what\u2019s on the other side stares down and thinks, that was almost me. You shouldn\u2019t be in here with that person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought my own line,\u201d Bart said, and the joke was trash, but it made something in Rowan\u2019s throat relax. \u201cI\u2019ll draw around us. We\u2019ll look ridiculous. We\u2019ll be saved by how stupid it is.\u201d\n\nRowan exhaled and set his jaw, a gesture he had probably learned from his face in the mirror. He watched Bart the way he watched a curve coming up, measuring and then committing. \u201cIf they tell me that\u2014\u201d He stopped and started again, because starting again is part of it. \u201cIf they tell me the worst, and I keep running anyway, what does that make me. If they tell me the worst and I don\u2019t, what does that make me then. Everything feels like a trap with velvet lining. I want to be punished and I want to be told it will mean something.\u201d\n\nIt would not mean anything in the way he wanted, and Bart could not give him that permission. He said instead that being alive was an insult some days and a mercy other days and you don\u2019t get to know which ahead of time. He told him Rinaldi had tried to keep facts in his mouth and they had spilled out and that made Bart trust him more. He told him that the lights in Kitchener had been wrong last week and he had not made them into a myth and maybe that counted as a practice for this; paying attention without turning everything into a sign. He told him that he did not have to decide anything in a room that called itself an emergency.\n\nWhen the coach came back it was because a man in a suit had joined him in the hall and together they made the shape of inevitability. The suit introduced himself with a name and a firm shake and a tone that lived somewhere between compassion and policy. He told Rowan that the child was in surgery and that the surgeons were the sorts of people who required their own adjectives. He told them that the family had been given their own room, that the hospital had provided a person whose job it was to say the right small things and to protect them from the wrong big ones. He told Rowan the words he had already heard about impairment and preliminary this and further that. He did not say anything about charges, and the air kept its breath.\n\nAfter, the coach asked Bart if he would eat something from a vending machine with him, and Bart said yes and found himself in a smaller room watching the false drama of the coil take its time releasing a snack. He didn\u2019t want the snack and he put it in his pocket and maybe it would be there when he did. They spoke in the language of logistics because logistics is polite in a crisis; the coach would get a hotel and make sure there was toothpaste and a shirt that did not carry the day\u2019s noise. The coach would remind the others, the team, that their opinions were not needed, not today, not here. The coach would make a statement that said nothing and everything. The coach had a list that would keep him from thinking and he was grateful for the list the way a swimmer is grateful for a buoy even if he knows he can float.\n\nRowan didn\u2019t ask him to stay. He didn\u2019t ask him to go. The space between stayed an animal in the room. Bart told him quietly that he would be in the lobby for a while, that he would drive his car in circles if that was more useful, that he would be wherever a person could be who couldn\u2019t fix anything. Rowan\u2019s mouth made the shape of thanks without committing to the vowels. When Bart left the room he had to put his hand on the wall once with his eyes closed, because you can walk away and still have the room dragging a short length of rope from your wrist.\n\nIn the lobby he found a corner with a plant that was trying harder than most plants. He sent Tess another message and then another; he told her what he\u2019d been told and asked her to tell their parents the version that would not startle their mother out of her skin. Rinaldi texted a sentence that sounded like scripture if you were inclined to make runners into worshipers; it said simply, \u201cI\u2019m here when you need a different set of ears, kid.\u201d Monique from the warehouse sent a heart and then wrote, \u201cSaw a headline. Are you okay, actually okay, not just the okay you say when you mean not okay.\u201d He wrote back that he would get back to her and that was the truth. The barista wrote, \u201cDo I need to bring you a coffee you can\u2019t finish,\u201d and he told her no and thank you and maybe later. The world was a set of hands trying to catch a ball while blindfolded.\n\nHe fell asleep for the length of one of those drifting moments that happen when you are not allowed to go home. In that non-sleep he dreamed of Rowan in both the ways he knew him, the boy on the warm-up loop with his fluid gait and the man in the chair with his hand over his face; they walked toward each other and could not quite make the same pace. He woke because his body remembered it needed to relieve itself of the coffee he had not drunk, and then he woke again because his phone lit with a name that would twitch his hands even when he was eighty. The message was a short one, written by fingers that had recently learned how to not shake. It told him the surgeons were still working. It told him he could go if he wanted. It told him thank you again without the vowels.\n\nHe went to his car and got into it and sat there as if that counted as leaving. The dusk had taken the edges of everything and left it softer and worse. He thought about staying in Guelph and then remembered he did not have a toothbrush and then laughed at himself because that was the smallest reason not to stay and the only one that did not make him feel like a coward. He pulled out of the lot and joined the stream of cars that all wanted to get somewhere else and might not. On the Hanlon he kept looking for the place where the road turned back into his life, and when it didn\u2019t he made one.\n\nKitchener held him with its same old blunt hands. The noodle shop smelled like a promise nobody could keep. He set his bag down and took off his shoes as if they were pieces of a day he could tidy away. He turned on the tap and filled a glass and then did not drink it. He sat on the floor and leaned his back on the couch and left the lights off and was the shape of someone who had known a morning and a night and found that they did not belong to the same plan. He did not consider stretching because there are days when the body is a bag you are allowed to put on the floor without apologies.\n\nWhen he woke the next morning it was because the sky had failed to make a case for sleep. He put on shoes without names attached to them so that he was not wearing anything that had promised him speed. He ran the way you walk by a river, alongside it, with respect, not trying to outpace it and not trying to become it. The geese had assembled their ridiculous committee on the grass and looked insulted when he gave them a wide berth; they made their gravelly claims on the earth and he gave them all of it. The path was slick with the last of the night\u2019s rain and he let it make him slower. When a cyclist behind him called out a gentle \u201con your left,\u201d he startled hard enough to shame himself and lifted a hand without looking back because eye contact felt like asking too much.\n\nHe thought not at all and then he thought too much, and then he swung back into that middle place runners live, where the body\u2019s insistence makes a fence for the mind and the mind doesn\u2019t hurt itself on anything for a while. He thought of last Friday at the bridge in the park and how the frog noise had made a kind of applause for their stupidity. He thought of Rowan\u2019s mouth making the choice to smile and then the choice not to. He thought of the kid with the ribbon on his bike and he told himself that thinking could be a kind of honoring if you did it gently enough. He counted the lamps over the water when he crossed and the numbers held like nails hammered into a good beam.\n\nAt the warehouse Monique folded him into her version of grace, which involved hot blueberry muffins and a scolding that did not sting. She told him he had permission to be useless and he told her he would be offended by that if he weren\u2019t, and she squeezed his shoulder once and left it. The boxes did what boxes do; they let him feel competent with small weights and let him pretend his hands were designed for holding. He didn\u2019t check the news until lunch because he did not want to turn the day into a series of jolts; then he did, and found that the story had set in like concrete. The reporters were using phrases they could be proud of and phrases they would regret. The comments were knives tucked into socks. There were photos from meets where Rowan looked immortal, which felt like an additional harm. There were photos of a teddy bear propped at the base of a pole, which felt like the only true thing.\n\nHe took out his phone again in the late afternoon and typed, \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d and this time he sent it, because he had to say that somewhere even if it did not cross any distance. He did not expect an answer and the lack of one was a relief. He went to Tess\u2019s after work because he had told her he would and because there is nothing like sitting at a kitchen table while someone cuts an onion badly and tells you about a coworker\u2019s cat. She wore a sweatshirt with paint on it and the dog climbed into his lap in direct contravention of the laws of physics. She told him she had watched fifteen minutes of a documentary about mushrooms and then had panicked herself into making brownies, and he told her none of this was allowed to make him feel better and it did anyway. She stared at him too closely and then stopped because she is who she is, and put a hand flat on the table like she was grounding it.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to come with you next time,\u201d she asked, and the coda was unspoken\u2014If there is a next time, if a next time exists that will let someone like me in without shattering.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the next time is,\u201d he said, and his voice surprised him with how steady it had chosen to be. \u201cI don\u2019t know what any time is right now. I know he\u2019s\u2026 there, and that he is the worst combination of alone and surrounded, and that he probably hates that I can go home and he has to stay in rooms that smell like liquid soap.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like someone who is thinking about winning,\u201d she said, and he made a face at her that tried to be a smile and ended up being a brief, failed frown.\n\n\u201cIf we talk about winning I\u2019ll climb into the cupboard and live there,\u201d he said, and she said that could be arranged, and then they ate cardboard pizza because it was what they had, and it was fine because it was hot and because they were.\n\nThat night his phone woke him on the first ring and he forgot to be disoriented. He knew the sound in his bones; he had hidden that ringtone for one person and now here it was, too loud in the small room. He answered and said his own name because he did not trust anything else to come out. On the other end, Rowan breathed like the air had become a set of steps he had to climb to reach speech.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d Rowan said, and his voice didn\u2019t crack the way you might expect; it made a lower failure, a kind of grinding like stone on stone. \u201cThey told me. The doctor had a pen in his pocket that kept knocking against the edge of the paper and I thought, that should be illegal, that noise, and then he stopped the pen with his finger and there were so many words and the only ones that stayed were \u2018we did everything\u2019 and I hate those words so much and I love them and I hate them.\u201d He paused and Bart said the small noises that keep a person connected to the phone, and Rowan continued in a rush, because you can only hold the floodgate so long. \u201cThere was a candle thing at the intersection. Already. I didn\u2019t go. I watched from the other side of the street and I counted the shoulders. People\u2019s shoulders do this thing when they\u2019re pretending to stand up straight, they go hard and then down and then they hold. There was a kid with a baseball cap who kept trying to give his mother a tissue and she kept not noticing her hand was empty. I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t be anyone they can see. I can\u2019t be anyone they don\u2019t, either.\u201d\n\nBart felt the floor tilt and then right itself because his body had to keep him level. He told Rowan he was sorry, and that word was nothing and everything, and he told him he would come now if that made sense, and Rowan said he was at a hotel with a name that had been bought by a chain and he gave Bart the room number like it was a secret even though it wasn\u2019t. He put on the first shirt his hand found, and he put on clean socks because that felt like respect, and he took his keys and did not forget his phone charger because you learn some things the hard way and others by watching your sister live.\n\nThe drive felt shorter in the dark because distances do not hold their shape without edges. He put on the radio this time because the quiet had started to amplify his breath in a way he didn\u2019t like, and a song came on that had meant something small to him last year and he let it be nothing now so that he could keep it. At the hotel the carpet in the lobby had a pattern that had been designed to be ignored. The night clerk had a face that said he had trained for nights with more bored college kids and fewer tragedies, and Bart wanted to tell him he was doing a good job at sitting upright, which is a job some days. He got a key card with the wrong name on it and corrected it with a smile that did not reach his eyes, and pressed the elevator button with the caution of a man disarming a bomb.\n\nRowan opened the door before Bart knocked, as if he had been standing on the other side with his hand on the handle. His hair had given up and so had his jaw. He wore a T-shirt with a logo that had lost its meaning and socks that made him look less like a statue and more like a person. The room had the smell of too much air conditioning and a chair that looked like a waiting area for a better chair. They didn\u2019t do the thing with arms right away because they weren\u2019t ready to do anything so honest; instead they stood so close that their exhalations could have been the same breath, and let the proximity itself be the admission.\n\n\u201cHe had a ribbon on his bike,\u201d Rowan said, and the sovereignty of that detail broke Bart open in a place he did not know he had kept strong. \u201cRed. Or not red. I think of that ribbon and then I think of his mother saying please into the air like it had taken something and would give it back if she used the right word. I walked back to the intersection after, late, and the lights kept switching and it made me want to tear them down because they were still doing their job and what right did they have to keep going. I know that\u2019s stupid. Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell you anything you already know,\u201d Bart said, and then he let himself step forward, because not stepping forward would have been a louder statement than any sentence. The hug was not pretty and it was not brief; it was not the kind that fixes anything because those are either fake or miraculous, and he did not believe in either tonight. He held him until Rowan\u2019s back loosened under his hands, until the breathing found the layer below the scrape, until one of them made a sound that belonged in a different decade and the other pretended not to notice.\n\nThey sat on the foot of the bed with the kind of distance between them that made room for holding hands, and they did, and the quiet was not empty; it had a texture. Rowan told him about the cop whose hands shook as much as his did, which made him feel less alone; he told him about a journalist who had asked for a quote with a tone so soft it could have been kind and could have been a sharpened edge. He told him about his coach, who had practiced saying no into a phone until it sounded like yes. Bart told him about the woman with the sun pin again, because that felt like a thing to repeat, and he told him about running slow and counting lamps, and he told him about Tess\u2019s onion and she would be annoyed with him for telling everyone about her onion for years.\n\nAt some point he realized he was hungry and the thought embarrassed him, and Rowan looked at him with interest like a scientist who has found a live specimen of normal life, and they ordered fries from a place that pretended to be open twenty-four hours and wasn\u2019t. The night clerk knocked softly and placed a bag on the carpet and left without making eye contact, and Bart had a sudden hat-raising love for him that was unreasonable and unearned. They ate fries like two men who had not been told that eating would not change the shape of the day, and it was good because salt and oil are honest even when everything else is performing.\n\n\u201cThis will be a thing,\u201d Rowan said finally, and he didn\u2019t mean the two of them, he meant the news cycle and the events and the people with opinions that made them feel full. \u201cIt will be a thing with legs. It will have a mouth that doesn\u2019t close. I don\u2019t know if I can run while it eats. I don\u2019t know if I can run if I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if I can do anything except stand near doors and hope they open when I have to move.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know tonight,\u201d Bart said, and he could feel the shape of Rinaldi in his voice in the way he measured the timing of his words. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to know tomorrow either, if tomorrow refuses to be a day and wants to be six. You can wait and count the lamps. You can wake up and decide to go outside and then not. You can bring a trainer to the lobby and unpack it here and look at it and pack it again. There isn\u2019t a correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make things sound manageable,\u201d Rowan said, and then he laughed in spite of himself, and it made the room widen. \u201cThat\u2019s new.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying it out,\u201d Bart said, and he yawned, which was both rude and human, and Rowan made a face at him that said, look at you, you animal, and then said the thing that was a permission slip; he told Bart to sleep for twenty minutes with his shoes off and his phone on, and Bart obeyed because sometimes you need to be told to do the thing you haven\u2019t admitted is necessary.\n\nHe woke to a darker dark and the shape of Rowan\u2019s shoulder next to his; he didn\u2019t remember laying down, which meant he had been more tired than he had admitted by a lot. He stood and drank from the tiny bottle of water that tasted like the inside of plastic and the ghost of rivers, and he washed his face in a sink that didn\u2019t quite understand his jawline, and he looked at himself in the mirror and did not try to make his face make sense. He told Rowan he would go home and be the person who answered texts and went to work and ran slow, and he told him to call him even if it wasn\u2019t for anything, especially if it wasn\u2019t for anything. Rowan nodded in the way of a man who had moved through a day like a field of mines and found a patch of grass and couldn\u2019t trust it yet.\n\nOn the drive home he let the radio say what it wanted because he could not keep being the only voice in the car. The lights at Gaukel were their same wrong self and he obeyed them because he had learned how to be a person in a place that made a thousand small demands on his attention and would take him if he did not obey. He climbed the stairs to his apartment and smelled the noodle shop\u2019s generosity and stood in his kitchen and put his hands on the counter like he was bracing for a wave. The posters on his wall curled and tried to wave him back, to remind him who he was when mornings belonged to him and the track was a benevolent ellipse. He looked at the Guelph meet flyer and the tiny face in the corner that had made him learn someone\u2019s eyes too well, and he did not cut it down because destroying paper is a gesture that means more to the person making it than to the paper.\n\nIn the days that followed the story learned the shape it would keep for a while. There were vigils and statements and a photograph released by the family of a boy smiling with both his front teeth in, and it made Bart sit down on a curb and put his head in his hands and breathe into his own palms for the heat of it. There were people who said accident like it could be a balm and people who said negligence like that could. There were timelines and diagrams with arrows, as if you could draw a map to the moment where everything turned cruel and then walk backward out of it. There were long apologies written by PR teams and short ones spoken by a single person trying to reach across a river. There were distances no one could cross.\n\nHe ran. He ran because it was his way of carrying a day without dropping it. He ran slow sometimes and fast when his body made a case for it and he didn\u2019t fight it. He didn\u2019t go to the track for a while because that felt like a room with too much history, and when he did, he did not take his watch out of his bag, and he did not ask for Rinaldi\u2019s voice and he got it anyway. Rinaldi watched him the way you watch a flame after it has caught, careful not to blow, careful not to starve it, and when Bart finished a set of easy laps he didn\u2019t need to say anything. The coach walked beside him on the infield and asked about Tess\u2019s dog and said something about the geese like they were one of the teams. He said, \u201cBase work. Base work is what you have when everything is a climb,\u201d and Bart nodded because this was one of the old lines that had forgotten to be trite.\n\nThere was a night when they went to the intersection together, not because either of them liked the idea of making a pilgrimage out of it, but because there are places you need to see with the person who is carrying the largest part of your fear for them. It was late enough that the road had put on its quiet, and the candles in jars made wavery pools, and the teddy bears looked like they were deciding whether to stay out and catch cold. Rowan kept his hood up and his head down and Bart stood a half-step to the side because not being in front is a skill too. They didn\u2019t speak for a long time because everything that could be said had a louder twin nearby, and then Rowan said, in a voice a person would use to coax a nervous dog, that the lights had a rhythm and he could feel himself syncing to it, which scared him more than anything.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t turn into a metronome,\u201d Bart said, and Rowan huffed a small smile, which was a thing to mark on a map.\n\nThey crossed when it was appropriate, and they did it like a ritual, and they stood on the far curb and looked back and people left them alone because grief can look like privacy if you do it right. It was not a thing that healed anything, but it made a notch on the stick they were using to measure the days. They went for coffee in a place that did not have a palatable bean in the building, and they sat and did a crossword without any intention of finishing it, and it was miraculous in the way that going to a dentist and not crying can be if you are five years old.\n\nOn a morning when the wind decided to pretend at summer, Bart woke with the thought that no one had asked his legs whether they were ready for a race and maybe that was why they were not angry at him. He had a meet on the calendar that someone would cancel for him if he asked, and he found that he did not want them to; he wanted to go and wear a number and not be the man on the steps of a hospital, at least for ten minutes. He told Rinaldi and Rinaldi said, \u201cFast is not disrespectful if you do it right,\u201d and Bart said he didn\u2019t know how to do anything right and Rinaldi said he hated when people were literal.\n\nThere would be more days. There would be days when the only thing he could do was sit on the kitchen floor and let the sunlight make a line across his knees and there would be days when the line at the end of four hundred meters would become the only honest idea in the world. There would be more nights when the hotel room smell would make him hungry and sick at once, and there would be mornings when the noodle shop\u2019s steam would be the closest thing to a blessing he could tolerate. There would be Rowan\u2019s mouth making the decision whether to be a smile and there would be his hands doing the work of lacing his shoes no matter what came out of the television. There would be numbers to count that didn\u2019t argue and people to love who did. He could feel the long race under his feet, the one that did not care about splits, and he told his legs they were allowed to be tired and they told him nothing back as always and he would have been worried if they had.",

                              "content": "The day of the meeting is one of those blank ones the calendar leaves unadorned so the world can write on it in its own bad handwriting. Rinaldi calls it media day like it\u2019s a training block and tells Bart it\u2019s none of his business and then adds, softer, that everything is his business now if he wants it to be. The athletics office at the University is a set of beige halls punctuated by framed jerseys and the kinds of trophies that always look like they\u2019re staring at the end of the hallway for an exit. Bart parks illegally and puts his hazard lights on because pretending to be in a hurry makes him feel like he has a reason to be.\n\nInside, he is not a name on any list, but runners have a way of gliding through doors on muscle memory and the kind of politeness that makes administrators tired. He finds a bench outside a conference room with a number on it he won\u2019t remember, and the door eats and spits people in suits and someone with a microphone that looks like it grew there. He puts his phone in his pocket and takes it out and puts it back, and when he hears Rowan\u2019s voice behind the door it is mostly absence, the vowels dulled down like he has filed his teeth to avoid an accident.\n\nHe tells himself he will not count minutes. He counts the squares in the carpet instead and calculates splits on them that make no sense; if one square is a hundred meters then this hallway is a quarter mile and he could do it in sixty seconds if he leaned into the corners. A receptionist coughs, a printer complains, someone\u2019s laugh scrapes the ceiling. When the door opens it\u2019s Rinaldi first, wearing his long defeat of a coat and a face that has become a wall between two rooms. He sees Bart and does not look surprised, which is something they are both grateful for. He lifts his chin toward the courtyard and Bart follows, hands in rings in his pockets like he might swing if he had the nerve.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Rinaldi says, and the answer does not fit the question Bart didn\u2019t ask. \u201cHe\u2019s not fine. He walked through a field of microphones and didn\u2019t step on any of them. I hate that I\u2019m proud of him. They wanted the sentence they could turn into a line under his name. He gave them the one he can live inside for a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the sentence,\u201d Bart asks, because he needs to know the size of the house his friend has just moved into.\n\n\u201cThat he is sorry and he does not expect forgiveness and he will do what he\u2019s told. That he\u2019ll think before he tries to do anything that looks like moving forward. That he is not going to argue with anyone\u2019s grief and he expects to be argued with anyway,\u201d Rinaldi says. \u201cThey made him practice it like a start.\u201d\n\nThe door opens again and Rowan comes out with the curve of his shoulders wrong, as if he\u2019s wearing a weight vest the exact size of his own breath. His eyes find Bart without scanning, a magnet trick. For a half second there is nothing in his face and then all of it rushes back in and crowds, and he slows in that way he does before a turn. The PR woman behind him puts a hand up near his elbow and he steps just out of range without making it an insult. He nods at nobody and somebody and then he is in the courtyard with them and the door clicks shut on the sound of the printer and the cough and the trophies.\n\n\u201cThey want me to write something,\u201d he says, and his voice has the gravel of a thousand small no\u2019s. \u201cSomething longer. Not a statement. A\u2014piece. I hate that word. A thing they can put somewhere that isn\u2019t a press release, that makes me look human and doesn\u2019t make anyone else less human. They said I could take my time and then told me a deadline.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want help,\u201d Bart asks, and he means: do you want me to sit in your hotel room and name the things you can\u2019t and make eggs and get the words out of your hands with mine.\n\n\u201cI want a different head,\u201d Rowan says, and then shakes his like he disagrees with himself on principle. \u201cBut yes. If you want to sit in a room while I fail at sentences, I would be grateful. I want to say one thing I mean without it turning into a stone someone throws at a window.\u201d\n\nThey go and sit with paper that pretends to be safe and a blank document that is actually a cliff-face. Rowan stares at the blinking cursor like it\u2019s testing his reflexes, and he writes a line and erases it and writes another that is just worse and then writes a clean one and leaves it. He doesn\u2019t show it to Bart and doesn\u2019t have to; Bart can read it in the way his shoulders lift when he hits a period. He doesn\u2019t tell Rowan what to say and he doesn\u2019t stay out of the way; he tells a story about the lights at Gaukel and the way the hand makes a dare and how sometimes the dare is to wait even when your legs are telling you their version of truth. He talks about counting lamps and about a boy\u2019s ribbon and a pen hitting a page, about the things that should be illegal and the things that just are. Rowan listens like he runs, with all of him, and then he turns back to the screen and types slowly, like he\u2019s setting down something fragile that he knows he\u2019ll have to lift again.\n\nTess texts from Kitchener to say the dog has learned a new trick where he sits before she tells him to, and sends a photo that looks like the dog invented the idea of good. She adds a link to a local opinion column that uses phrases like shared roads and communal sorrow and consequences and the awful necessary, and Bart does not click it. He leaves the link in the chat like a traffic cone. He sends back a picture of Rowan\u2019s ear because he has accidentally zoomed too close and because it makes Tess laugh so hard she sends a voice note that is just wheezing and a soft swear.\n\nThere is talk of a service, private, for the family, and Rowan says the family has sent a message through a person whose title is something like coordinator. The message is not a request and not an invitation; it is the sort of communication that lets a person like him know the family knows he is a person, which is generous and impossible. They tell him they understand if he cannot attend and it is simultaneously the only thing he wants to do and the last thing. He asks Bart if he will come and be the piece of him that can stand up in seats and look at the floor and breathe, and Bart tells him yes before the question finishes because there are things you say yes to as a lever against the world.\n\nThe day is warm in the way that makes suits mean and dresses honest. The small chapel is a language he does not speak and does not want to be caught learning wrong, and Bart is a small rectangle of steadiness two pews in, next to a woman who dabs at her eyes with a napkin that has a coffee ring on it. Rowan sits where the coordinator tells him to sit, not in the back because that would look like he was hiding, not in the front because that would feel like a theft. He sits in the second-to-last row and counts the knots in the wood because numbers don\u2019t argue. The boy\u2019s name is said, which makes him permanently someone to the room, not an absence. Stories are told and they have the shape of a small person who collected bottle caps and liked the letter R because it felt like a race when you said it. People laugh in the sharp way that makes laughter behave. People cry in the private way that makes crying an honest verb. When a song starts, Rowan stands because everyone stands, and he feels like his knees are not part of his body, as if they are on loan and he will have to return them with notes about scuffs.\n\nAfter, there is a line winding toward the family and the family\u2019s hands are an assembly line and it makes Bart want to unspool the ribbon and tell everyone to go home and write letters instead. Rowan doesn\u2019t go into the line. He waits where he\u2019s told to wait and he considers leaving and he considers staying until they turn off the lights. In the end it is the father who appears, as if conjured, standing at Rowan\u2019s elbow with a face that has learned what it looks like when it makes someone else feel better and what it looks like when it does not. He holds out a hand and Rowan takes it because this is one of the rituals that has weight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to you,\u201d the man says, and his voice is the scrape of a man who has made decisions he did not want to make. \u201cBut I know if I were you I would want to say sorry and I would hate myself for how small it would sound. I know you did not wake up yesterday and choose to put my boy in a room with white lights. I know you have a life you are supposed to go back to and that it will be crowded now with people with things to say. I will not ask you to punish yourself and I will not tell you how to be. But I will tell you that if there is anything useful you can make from this, do it in his name and not yours. Do you understand me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Rowan says, and the words are not strong and not enough and not nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d He stops, because his mouth has run out of permission. \u201cI will try. I am sorry in a way that does not change anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt changes you,\u201d the man says, and his grip tightens once, not to hurt, to mark. \u201cThat matters to me because it will keep you from forgetting. I don\u2019t want you to forget. I don\u2019t want anyone to forget him. That does not mean I want to see your face. I am not that kind. But I will not make a hobby of hating you. That would make him into something he was not.\u201d\n\nBart watches this and feels the strange lightness that comes when a room heavier than air lets you stand. He thinks of his father\u2019s hockey poster and the rituals people build to keep the flood at bay. He thinks of Rinaldi\u2019s old line about base work, and how some work you do on your own in the dark and no one times you and you get no medal for it and still it is the whole point.\n\nThe next week the meet is in Windsor and the drive is longer than any good idea, straight and then not straight, past fields that have decided to be green as if it were only ever a decision. Bart reads the starters list and finds his name further down than it has been lately and he likes that; he likes the smallness of it. He likes that he will not be announced as the man who beat anyone, just as one more pair of spikes. Rowan does not come, because there are only so many rooms a person can sit in while strangers climb in and out of them with their eyes, but he sends a text before call room: run clean, run ugly if needed, save no stupid pride for later. Bart puts his phone face down and breathes like he could pre-pay for oxygen.\n\nThe track there has a texture he hasn\u2019t felt since college, the grain of it coarser, the corners tighter, the wind coming in from the river with a voice you can\u2019t teach. Rinaldi says to treat it like an old argument; don\u2019t expect to win, expect to say what you came to say. The gun is not a surprise and the field does what fields do, sorts itself, tries to mess with itself, tries to make a plan out of elbows. He sits and he floats and he refuses to use any of his anger because he has promised himself and someone else that he will put that resource somewhere that pays interest. The bell feels less like panic and more like a suggestion, and he goes when his legs have found their own yes. He finishes in a place that is not a headline and looks at the clock and it gives him a number he can love without apologizing to it.\n\nLater, sitting in the bus with his forehead on the cool of the window, he texts Rowan his time and Rowan sends back the mouse emoji and then the knife and then the heart and then writes, I am so unbelievably proud of how ordinary that looks on paper. It busts something open in him and the laugh that comes out is stitched with relief. He turns the camera on himself and the other men in the row make faces like clowns and he sends that too, and Rowan writes, I would say ugly but that\u2019s exactly what I told you to be, and Bart writes back that Runner\u2019s World will never put him on a cover with that mouth.\n\nThere are meetings now with people who run charities for roads and bikes and city planning, the kinds of folk who know the color of every light and the cost of every bulb. They ask Rowan to come to one and he does not promise but he ends up there anyway, at a community center that smells like last week\u2019s bingo and this morning\u2019s lemon cleaner. He stands in front of a projection of a diagram with white lines and arrows and he says that he is learning more about stop times and human reaction than he ever wanted to know. He says he will give money and time and also he will listen to people who build things, which is harder than giving money because it means some of the things you think are obvious are actually the opposite. He nods when an old man in a plaid shirt tells him he\u2019s doing it wrong and he nods when a young woman with a nose ring tells him he\u2019s doing it right and he leaves not knowing which nod will grow something. When he gets back to his car he texts Bart, I said yes to wearing a hideous T-shirt for a 5K and I will make you wear one too, and Bart says, make it purple and I\u2019m out.\n\nAt home, Tess is thinking about moving out from their parents\u2019 house for the third time in as many months. She has a spreadsheet, which means she is serious in a way that makes their mother nervous, and she brings it over to Bart\u2019s place and lays it on the kitchen table like a surgical plan. He makes coffee that tastes like effort and nods while she explains why the second floor walk-up with the weird landlord is somehow better than the one with the good light. She pauses in the middle of explaining hydro and says in the same voice, he texted you, didn\u2019t he, and Bart says yes, and she says are you breathing, and he says yes, exceedingly, and she says okay and goes back to the spreadsheet like she hasn\u2019t just put a hand on his head and smoothed down the worry.\n\nThey go to parents\u2019 night for a cousin\u2019s recital and sit on folding chairs that pinch the back of Bart\u2019s thighs, and a child plays Ode to Joy with the fervor of a man escaping a burning building and a grandparent records every second in a vertical video that will live on a device forever. Owen, the cousin with the trumpet, misses a note and grins at the floor and the applause lifts him anyway. After, in the crowded school hallway, a woman Bart remembers vaguely from someone\u2019s book club stops him and says she saw him on TV in the background of something and is he the runner, and before he can say anything she is telling him that she thinks it is brave, what they are all doing, which is a sentence with no clear subjects. He nods until nodding becomes a mode.\n\nThere is training that is just training, which feels like finding a belt loop in the dark. There are long runs through the industrial part of town where the smell of molasses from a factory makes the air taste like cookies, and through the park where the geese have had babies and their meanness has turned into a focused sort of watchfulness he respects. There are drills that do not ask for philosophy and weights that do not ask for apologies. There are the kind of numbers that belong on the watch and the kind that belong in a different part of your chest and both matter in proportion that changes each day. There is the ache in the right ankle that has learned to raise its hand when the weather changes. There is Rinaldi adding two hundred meters to the end of a session for no reason and then taking them away for an even less good reason.\n\nOn a Tuesday evening when the light sticks around in an affectionate way, Bart and Rowan sit in a park in Guelph with coffee that tastes like someone boiled a shoe and talked it into believing. They don\u2019t talk about the thing first; they talk about shoes and coffee, the lies they like best. Then Rowan puts his cup down and says the family wants to set up a fund in the boy\u2019s name and would he help with the race they are going to hold, it is going to be a fun run which is a phrase that makes him want to punch the sky and then apologize to it. He says he cannot imagine speaking there but he can imagine making a course that is not a hazard and a start line that\u2019s fair and a finish that gives people the feeling, the brief feeling, like they have unhooked themselves from everything and are floating and will not plummet.\n\nBart tells him he will bring cones and whistles and the barista with the beanie who knows how to bark at people in a way that makes them love her. He tells him he will run the perimeter and pretend to look serious when what he will be doing is holding his breath for the whole hour. He tells him he will make sure there are more port-a-potties than anyone thinks is reasonable because that is one of the only things that can make an event feel like someone cared. He does not tell him that he is scared of the intersection, which has become not an intersection but a member of the cast, a person at the table with a drink in front of them.\n\nAfterward they go back to the hotel because hotels have become their shared neutral zone, places where no one has hung pictures yet and the art is meaningless. They sit on the carpet with a bag of grapes and a bag of bad popcorn and the television on with the sound off because mouths moving without sound is easier to share a room with than mouths with. They lean into each other like they are two pieces standing up together and pretending they are a wall. They kiss without turning the world off because it doesn\u2019t, and it is new and not new, and they allow themselves the kindness of not making metaphors out of it. Rowan laughs against his mouth and says that he will never be good at this, meaning the part where you hold a thing that could break and love it anyway, and Bart says that everyone who is good at it looks worse in photographs.\n\nThere is a day, then, when nothing dramatic happens, and they notice it because they have been trained by the last month to flinch. Bart buys a bag of oranges and they are sweet and he thinks of telling someone and then realizes this is a thing he can keep for himself. Rowan runs on a treadmill because he does not want to learn a new neighborhood and he likes the lie the numbers tell, how smooth it is when there are no lights and no corners and no new shadows; he runs and watches an old meet on mute and makes friends with a recurring blister. Tess sends him a photo of a new apartment with cupboards that close properly and says she signed because sometimes choosing anything is the only way to keep gravity working. Rinaldi stands at the start of the track in his big coat even though it is warm and says nothing for an entire hour like it is a discipline and not a default.\n\nThe fundraisers make their posters. The comments keep coming until they don\u2019t matter in the way that being hit by rain stops being surprising and just gets you wet. The PR people lose interest because they are paid to, and the people with long memories keep theirs. Basketball happens and hockey still has hold over the city\u2019s heart, and a teenager Bart doesn\u2019t know asks for a selfie in the grocery store and says he has been practicing his stride to look like his and Bart says don\u2019t, find your own, mine is borrowed anyway. The dog learns to not bark when he\u2019s asleep, which is the kindest thing anyone has done all month.\n\nOn a Thursday evening when the sky looks like someone oiled it, they go back to the intersection, not to punish themselves but because there are flowers to replace and a note from a child who wrote in purple marker that made Bart\u2019s throat do the thing. Somebody has put a tiny set of plastic cones in a line like a drill for a toy. Rowan looks at them and something in his shoulders lifts, not joy, something adjacent and less theatrical. He picks one up and sets it back down as if it were an egg. He tells Bart he can feel the rhythm of the lights in his bones now and wonders if he will ever unlearn it. Bart tells him he will one day hate that he can\u2019t remember it, and both of them nod because both are probably true.\n\nThey go from there to the bridge in the park because they have decided to make a ritual of soft things, and they lean on the rail and talk trash about geese and make fun of joggers in a way that is affectionate because they are them. They stand close enough to share notices; Rowan points out a bat slicing the dusk and Bart points out a couple arguing quietly about nothing that will matter and both of them agree it is evidence of life. The water does what water does, minding its own business with great drama. A cyclist rings his bell and they step aside in unison and Rowan bumps his hip into Bart\u2019s on purpose and it shocks them both with how simple it feels.\n\nSummer rolls toward them like a dog that is more enthusiasm than aim. The nights get noisy in the way that makes sleep more like a suggestion, and Bart finds himself awake at times he used to occupy only on race days. He goes out once, at midnight, and runs the empty parts of the city where the streetlights are tired and the sidewalks have a scar and feels the particular exile of being the only person doing a thing. He thinks, half joking, of joining a swim of night-shift nurses and cooks who move through lights at the wrong rhythm, and he tells himself this is a base of a different kind and maybe it counts for something that can\u2019t be measured in laps.\n\nThe first time they try to have a real argument, it is about nothing and then about everything. Rowan says yes to too many interviews in a row and becomes a person who is trying to say the same sentence with different mouth shapes, and Bart tells him so. Rowan says he is allowed to punish himself the way he prefers, which is public, and Bart says that is just exercise for other people\u2019s eyes. He says this in the kitchen with a spoon in his hand and his voice takes on a shape he does not like; Rowan stiffens because his body knows that shape and does not want to. It is a ridiculous fight and also it is exactly the kind they will have for the next ten years if they get ten years; it is about how you decide to be in the world when being in the world is a choice that hurts yourself and other people no matter what you pick.\n\nThey stop before they say anything they will have to fetch out of the air and apologize to. Rowan sits down with his back against the counter like he is waiting for a wave to stop galloping forward and he says he is scared of doing nothing because doing nothing feels like disrespect and doing everything feels like theft, and Bart sits beside him and says that is the exact problem of living and he will not solve it tonight so stop asking himself to be a genius. They eat cereal out of the same bowl because that is the compromise the evening offers and it is not romantic, it is just kind, which is better.\n\nThere is the day of the fun run, which is exactly what it says and not what it says at all. The city permits arrive with the briskness of bureaucracy and the volunteers show up with enthusiasm and wrong shoes. Bart wears a bright vest that makes him look like a traffic cone and he is delighted by how ugly he is. Rowan wears a cap low and moves from place to place like a whisper that has learned to walk. The family has chosen a small speech that is not a speech and it makes every person at the start line stand a little straighter without knowing why. Children jitter like caffeine in human form and adults tie and re-tie laces like that is how they will keep their hearts from falling out on the path.\n\nBart does the count and he waits longer than he wants to between three and two because someone is still messing with a stroller and he wants to be a person who gives them a second. He says go and it feels like a good word. People move forward like a tide and he watches their backs for a long time, the way you watch anything you love leave a room without you, and then he goes to his place on the course and points and claps and says things like, yes, that\u2019s a corner, look at you taking a corner, like he has been hired to narrate the day in a nonthreatening way. He finds himself next to the boy\u2019s father at one point and they stand about a meter apart and say nothing for a minute that stretches like dough and then the man says thank you directly to the air and Bart lets the air deliver it because he hasn\u2019t earned catching it.\n\nRowan speaks at the end into a mic that crackles like it is trying to get out of responsibility. He says what he wrote and not what he wrote, because the day has ideas and his sentences have to accommodate them. He says the boy\u2019s name and how it doesn\u2019t belong to him and he says that if the world is going to be as hard as it is then the only mitigation is daily kindness in medium doses. He doesn\u2019t look up for the first part and then he does and he sees the faces and it doesn\u2019t hurt worse, which shocks him. When he is done there is the kind of applause people do when they want sound to be useful, and it isn\u2019t, but it is also not nothing, and that is all they get.\n\nThey go home by which they mean they go to Bart\u2019s over the noodle shop because home is not one place anymore and maybe that is okay, and they stand at the kitchen counter and eat cut-up fruit like they are pretending to be people in an advertisement for health, and then they sit on the floor because chairs are still too formal. The window is open and the smell of broth makes even grief feel like it could be fed. Rowan leans his head back against the cabinet and his eyes close and his mouth goes soft and he does not sleep but he puts down all the weight for a minute and it is a thing Bart wants to memorize, the exact angle of that surrender.\n\nThat night the radio on the shelf, the one that only gets three stations, plays a song Bart remembers from some apartment in college that always smelled like laundry and salsa. He hums it without noticing and Rowan looks at him like he has just told a joke in a language he didn\u2019t know he had learned. They do not dance because that would be cute and they don\u2019t have that kind of energy; they sit and let the music draw a circle around the edges of the room and keep the rest of the world out for four minutes and then the DJ talks and the circle breaks and that is fine. They go to bed without making promises and wake up with the day having made some for them, and they keep the smallest ones because those are the ones that hold.\n\nOn a morning that thinks it is autumn even though the calendar disagrees, Bart stands on the bridge in Victoria Park and watches his breath for the first time in months. The lamps over the water are still on because the light is late, and he counts them without thinking and gets to six and forgets and starts again and it is a ritual that has grown new meanings without asking his permission. He imagines himself ten years from now, on a different morning, counting something else and telling a younger person that numbers are a kindness when nothing else is. He imagines Rowan, not the speed, but the way he leans when he gets serious, and he thinks of that instead of the finish line in a race, because there are other places where arriving counts.\n\nHe runs. He runs like he always has and like he never will again, which is to say he runs inside the shape of his own life and the new annexes the last month has built on it. He passes a man in a Rangers jersey walking a dog with a face like it knows the score. He stops at the light at Gaukel not because the universe has taught him anything but because that is what you do, and when it changes he crosses and nothing extraordinary happens, which feels like a blessing so ordinary he does not know how to hold it in his mouth. He goes past the coffee shop where the barista has put up a sign that says, be kind, or at least be quiet, and he waves and she flips him off in a way that means, take care.\n\nHe goes home and showers and eats eggs and laces his shoes when Rinaldi texts a set that is just a number and a winking face and a skull and he laughs at the stove and text-bullies Tess into coming to the track and bringing her terrible music. He decides to race next weekend and not think about what that means until he is standing on a line, because some decisions you make in pieces, like lowering yourself into cold water. He writes to Rowan without looking at the words, something like dinner and also something like I want to see you breathe, and the reply is not a sentence, it is a photo of a lamp and the words one-two-three-four, and it is enough.",

                              "content": "The day decided to be bright before it decided to be warm, as if light could trick the air into waking up. Tess showed up to the track with her hair in a knot that held on by conviction and a speaker she claimed would motivate the dead. Rinaldi took one look at the speaker and acquiesced to its existence like a man who knew which battles mattered. He handed Bart the workout with a tap of his thick finger: three by a kilometer at something that looked like honesty with two laps of mercy between, then a tidy ladder down. Tess set her playlist to a war between genres and stretched with the seriousness of someone who had never sprinted and had no intention of starting now. When she started dancing between the reps with the aggressive optimism of a person who had avoided mirrors, three high school kids on the infield watched her like they were trying to decide if adulthood was worth it.\n\nThe intervals bit in the way that tells you your joints remember their job and intend to perform it. Bart ran the first rep like an apology to his lungs and the second like an argument with the false ease of the first, and he ran the third with the kind of focus that made the world a generous blur. He counted the white pebbles embedded in the rubber for a ridiculous distance and let himself think only as far as the next ten meters. Rinaldi gave him a look during the recoveries that was neither permission nor accusation; it was an inventory that kept finding everything in place. At the end of the set, sweat made language more difficult and Bart put his hands on his knees and found the same old floor with the same old gratitude.\n\n\u201cNot bad for a man who\u2019s recently taken up recreational civic engagement,\u201d Rinaldi said, which was his way of indicating that he had seen the fun run posters and had believed them as much as posters deserve to be believed. Tess threw him a towel with excessive force and he let it bounce off his shoulder as if to humor her.\n\n\u201cYour music is war crimes,\u201d he told her when he could breathe and she shrugged like a general.\n\n\u201cFast is fast,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want pancakes or something with vegetables to pretend we\u2019re good people?\u201d\n\n\u201cPancakes,\u201d Bart and Rinaldi said together without looking at each other, and Tess hooted like she had orchestrated the chorus.\n\nHis phone vibrated on his bag when he was collecting spikes like a man clearing pieces of himself off a floor. Rowan had sent him a photograph of a lamp again, the pale light over a hotel desk or a house lamp or something you could find in any city if you looked at the right time. Under it, he had written one-two-three-four but then, for the first time, added five-six and two small boxes that indicated laughter so slight it would only be visible in a certain angle of sun. Bart typed dinner like he was ordering a weather front and Rowan replied without a word, sending only a pin to a greasy spoon he claimed not to be embarrassed by anymore. Tess looked over his shoulder and said make him pay, he owes the universe, and Bart told her this was not a ledger that would ever balance, but he smiled because everything they did would be such ledger work for a while.\n\nHe had been carrying the thought of telling his parents like a coin he couldn\u2019t decide whether to spend. It was an idea that grew heavy in his pocket as the week went on and then became light for no good reason, which was how he knew it had decided for him. He texted Tess that he would be there for dinner and she sent back an array of warnings disguised as jokes. The day of, he brought a cake from the bakery on Duke and felt like a bribe artist, and he stood on the porch of the house he grew up in trying to recall how to open a door without sounding like he was arriving with news. His mother shouted that it was open in a way that had not changed since he was eleven, and the smell of chili and onions and a loaf of bread that could have been a pillow hit him as he turned the handle.\n\nBen was on the couch watching a pre-game show with a volume that believed in itself. He grunted hello and then stood to hug his son because rituals can survive the onslaught of habits. The goalie poster still hung on the wall like a saint you didn\u2019t have room to accommodate in your worldview anymore, which made it no less present. Tess sat at the kitchen table with a bottle of hot sauce and her laptop and the dog under her heel like a contraband, and she lifted her head when he came in and nodded the smallest nod a person could nod. Their mother chattered at the stove, asking about work and about whether he\u2019d seen that article about the new paved path by the river and whether he wanted sour cream or whether he would pretend to be a person who didn\u2019t. It took Bart too long to find a place for the cake on the counter and then he had to take a breath because he didn\u2019t want this to feel like a scene, and then he started talking.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say boyfriend because the word felt like a piece of costume jewelry he\u2019d been given in a different production. He said Rowan, and he said it like a name among other names. He said that they were seeing each other, which sounded like optics but meant something else to his tongue. He said they were figuring it out and he said it wasn\u2019t straightforward because nothing was, and he said he was trying to make room for both running and the grief that ran parallel to it. His mother put down a wooden spoon as if it had become a part of his sentence. Ben looked at the TV like it had betrayed him by being there.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the room to decide which role it would play. His mother crossed the kitchen and touched his cheek in a gesture so tender it made the noise of the house recede. Tess, who had known already and had known how the conversation would feel, kicked him under the table not as a correction but as a way of keeping him in his own skin. Ben inhaled as if learning a new kind of air and then exhaled like an apology to no one in particular.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Ben said, which was both inadequate and sincere. \u201cIs this the kid we\u2019ve seen on TV. I mean\u2014kid. He\u2019s hardly. That man. With the hair. He runs like a television ad for running.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bart said, because the speed with which his father had found the correct person and the incorrect vocabulary was funny in a way that saved the moment. \u201cNot the hair anymore.\u201d\n\nBen scratched his chin in the way he did when aligning thoughts. \u201cI don\u2019t know a lot about how to talk about this without stepping on my own tongue,\u201d he said, and he didn\u2019t look at his wife when he said it like he\u2019d promised himself he wouldn\u2019t outsource. \u201cBut I know about sitting in a crease and having a puck come at you and doing everything you\u2019re supposed to do and still hearing the net pop loud behind you. After games, you look at that and you can decide it means something about you, or you can decide it means something about physics and the bodies involved, and sometimes the answer you pick is different depending on whether there\u2019s anyone behind the glass watching. I ain\u2019t comparing. Just, I know you\u2019re with somebody who\u2019s going to be told by a lot of people what it means about him. He knows, I hope, that the people in this house don\u2019t think it means the same thing those people think it means.\u201d\n\nBart had to grip the back of the chair for a second because his father had never given him a better speech and probably never would. His mother nodded at Ben with a surprise that softened into affection, and Tess let out a small noise that was less a laugh than relief tripping over something. The dog, oblivious to human nuance, sneezed and sneezed again in a way that forced everyone to attend to the ridiculous. Bart said thank you, and he meant it for more things than the person he looked at.\n\nThey ate the chili and Ben put his opinions about three defensemen in the neutral zone back into the atmosphere where they belonged. His mother asked what Rowan liked to eat and then amended it to what did he hate because that would be simpler to plan around, and Bart said he could get him to eat an alarming number of things if you called them the right names. Tess asked a mean question about whether he\u2019d finally found someone who would listen to his thoughts on shampoo and he told her to put the hot sauce down before she injured herself. The evening ended the way it always had, with dishes and the gentle war over who would take leftovers, the kitchen a theater of small competences. If the world outside wanted to make them into more than a family, the kitchen would not honor the request.\n\nThe next day he drove to Guelph and waited in a parking lot that smelled like spring with a headache. Rowan had agreed to see a sports psychologist because, as he said, it was that or let the inside of his head become a room with one lightbulb and no switch. He emerged an hour later with the look of a person who had told a stranger three difficult truths and had not been punished. They drove to a drive-thru that had a loyalty program and ordered fries they didn\u2019t need and a milkshake that made Rowan blink because it was better than his expectations wanted to allow.\n\n\u201cShe has a chair that makes you sit up,\u201d Rowan said, staring at a packet of ketchup like it contained notes for his next race. \u201cBig soft arms so you sink a little, but not enough to pretend. She asked me if I want to run because it\u2019s my job or because it feels like home. It felt like a trick. I told her I want to because it\u2019s the only thing that feels like an answer when someone asks me a question I don\u2019t know how to answer. She said that\u2019s not a bad reason but it can\u2019t be the only one, because jobs and homes both burn down and then where are you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d Bart asked, because asking is efficient and also kind when you don\u2019t think you can be either.\n\n\u201cI said I want to run because it\u2019s how I meet parts of myself I like,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cShe wrote that down and nodded and I wanted to steal the notebook because she was right and I hate it when someone else has custody of my best sentence. She told me to write a better one later. She said we\u2019re going to work on how not to turn every light into a sign. She said I can grieve and still eat lunch in the same day and the universe won\u2019t collapse. Honestly, I\u2019d like to verify.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just ate fries,\u201d Bart said. \u201cLunch verified.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh,\u201d Rowan said, and his mouth tipped at the corner because there was still some grief left in him that didn\u2019t mind being teased.\n\nLondon was the next race and it took longer to get there than it had any right to. The highway made a case for itself that involved farms that looked like paintings in a dentist\u2019s office and cars that believed lane changes were a form of improvisational dance. Bart sat in the bus with a row of men whose knees had no intention of making room for any other knees and listened to someone\u2019s endless argument about whether you could practice negative splits in the weight room. He closed his eyes and dragged a cap over them when the debate drifted toward carbon plates, and he let the window be a television that was state-funded and unwilling to satisfy.\n\nTD Stadium at Western had a track that had seen enough fast men to forget their names, which was comforting. The sun appeared and disappeared behind a bank of clouds like a child playing with a lamp, and the wind came from a direction that made flags honest and made coaches swear. It smelled like cut grass and stale Gatorade and someone\u2019s nerve. Rinaldi met him with a plan that was more attitude than mathematics.\n\n\u201cPace your teammate through a thousand,\u201d the coach said, jerking his head toward a kid who had the shoulders of a person who had learned too many definitions of the word potential. \u201cMake sure he doesn\u2019t get stupid in the first three hundred and make sure he\u2019s tired enough in the last two hundred to learn something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about me,\u201d Bart asked, equal parts relief and disappointment, because the version of him from two months ago would have flinched at being used as a tool for someone else\u2019s day.\n\n\u201cWhat about you,\u201d Rinaldi asked, and then he smiled with his eyes because he was not as cruel as he liked to pretend. \u201cYou\u2019ll get yours again. Today, be useful.\u201d\n\nIt was astonishing how good useful felt when you\u2019d let yourself be changed by having to be useless. He took the line without vanity and let the first lap be slow enough that the field shuffled behind him, cursing, and then he let the second lap rise to somewhere that teased the pack without breaking it. He kept an ear learning and an eye for elbows, and he looked for his teammate\u2019s breath as a way to tell where to be, and he found that if you listen with your bones you can hear someone else\u2019s hope without letting it drown you. He felt ridiculous things\u2014pride that wasn\u2019t about time, calm in the middle of a corner, a strange, quiet happiness when he moved to the outside at nine hundred and let the kid take the rail. He saw the kid\u2019s stride open in a way it had been shy about and he wanted to clap mid-race like a civilian. He finished three places back and did not mind, and the time was a neat number that would not keep anyone awake; he loved it and let it be.\n\nAfter, under the bleachers where the shade smelled like popcorn and old soda, he stretched and watched a distant group of bunched jerseys and felt something he had not allowed himself to feel in a while\u2014a future that wasn\u2019t a cliff. He didn\u2019t notice Rowan until the air around him shifted as if someone had stepped through a doorway. Rowan had come like a person at the back of a theater slipping in after the trailers. He wore an anonymous cap and sunglasses he wouldn\u2019t have picked if he\u2019d had more choices, and he stood in the odd angle that tall men take when they are trying not to be seen. The way his mouth softened when he saw Bart told Bart the running had been the right thing to do with the day.\n\n\u201cYou looked like a solution,\u201d Rowan said, which was the highest compliment he gave anyone. \u201cLook at you, making math you can love.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did what I was told,\u201d Bart said, because that sounded humble and hid the part of him that had found the best kind of joy in it. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be under these bleachers. This is the domain of high school flirtations and discarded sunflower seed shells.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. I missed my window to learn how to carve my initials into aluminum. Show me,\u201d Rowan said, and he leaned into the column beside him and let the shade make a bald case for a moment\u2019s privacy. \u201cI keep wanting to tell you not to look for me when you\u2019re running, like a superstition, like I\u2019ll jinx you. But then I am here and my face gives me away. It\u2019s perverse and I want to find a moral that makes it less so.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou being here isn\u2019t a moral,\u201d Bart said. \u201cIt\u2019s weather. I will dress for it.\u201d\n\nThey touched at the edge of public affection in a place where teenagers would not notice because they were busy awkwarding themselves into whatever came next in their lives. Rowan smelled like sun on cotton and antiseptic and coffee he had decided he didn\u2019t trust, and his hand on Bart\u2019s wrist was not a statement, it was a shared domain of pulse. They didn\u2019t say love because that word sounded like something that had been stolen and pawned too many times. They said other things in the language they had grown by accident\u2014imperatives that were requests, questions that excused themselves before they finished, jokes that cushioned stairs.\n\nThe letter went out the next day. It appeared on a backdrop that looked like anyone\u2019s website and it used his full name and did not use any cheap mechanics for apology. Rowan wrote about waiting at the intersection of grief and responsibility and about how nothing protects you from an outcome once it has decided to be the outcome. He wrote about the boy\u2019s name the way you write someone\u2019s name on a lunch bag you hope returns home. He wrote about lanes and lights and how speed deceives you into thinking you can negotiate with it, and he wrote about stopping, and about wheels, and about looking left and right and counting to a number that will never be high enough and doing it anyway. He wrote that he was sorry in a way that did not imagine that sorry could erase anything, and he wrote that he was learning how to donate his exact pride to people who build things in cities so that fewer of us have to stand on corners and count. He did not ask for forgiveness because that would have made the letter an act of procurement. He asked for nothing because there was not a thing in the world he trusted himself to ask for with clean hands.\n\nThe reactions did what reactions do. Some were so generous they had weight and could hold a day. Some were so sharp they made him bleed again. An old coach sent him a picture of a stopwatch on a track and wrote, still here, and Rowan stared at it until the numbers blurred. A boy from a high school team Bart had paced once sent a message that said simply, my mom says thanks for what you said about helmets, we are buying one that fits this time, and Rowan texted it to Bart and said, this is going to be the piece of mail I keep in my sock drawer.\n\nThe work at the warehouse did its sacred duty of ignoring the news cycle, and Monique handed him boxes that weighed as much as they said they did and told him to stop reading the comments. He told her he had stopped after three and she told him that made him smarter than ninety percent of the world. She put a muffin in his hand without looking at his face and he put it in his bag without pretending he wouldn\u2019t eat it. At the coffee shop the barista had a sign up that said kindness is free, insults will cost you extra, which had exactly the right tone of sermon. She drew a latte art heart on Rowan\u2019s to-go cup once and then smushed it with the lid because she refused to be corny on paper, and he laughed into his collar like the sound might escape.\n\nThe legal side closed out not with a bang but with a statement that came on a Tuesday afternoon when the world had chosen to be having a weather event. There would be no charges. The file would be a slim folder in a cabinet until someone needed to quote a page number. There were sentences about contributory factors and there were sentences about the way white lines get slippery in a certain kind of wet. There were names of agencies and there were forms that would be filed forever. There was an email Rowan did not open and a call he returned anyway to a voice that had to say words to many people who would not slot them in the right place, and that voice told him thank you for your cooperation and he said nothing because politeness felt like both a courtesy and a theft.\n\nThey celebrated the absence of a new wound with dinner that felt like a held breath being let out slowly. Bart boiled pasta at his apartment like a person performing normal for an audience who had paid with the exact change of their day. Rowan cut tomatoes as if they might argue and found they didn\u2019t. They ate with their knees touching under the table and decided that was better than candles. He talked about the therapy session where he had to sit with the image of the intersection without narrating it and how his body had found two new places to keep the tension when the old places got tired. Bart told him about Rinaldi\u2019s new theory that they both knew was a rebranded old one and about Tess\u2019s latest pretense at budgeting. They both tried not to say what would happen when the season got serious, which only meant they said it in the spaces between sentences. After, they washed dishes with the ease you get when you\u2019ve decided not to make a metaphor out of suds, and they left two forks for later because there are always two forks for later.\n\nJuly arrived with the kind of heat that makes everything in the city consider violence. The geese marched their children around like little dictators and every patch of shade was adopted and claimed by something with a spine. Bart adjusted his routes to respect the sun and respect his ankle and respect the limits of his own ego. He sat in the little room with Rinaldi and watched race footage he had watched four times already and found a fifth frame to love and a sixth frame to hate. They entered meets quietly and left them with whatever the day gave them, not feeling entitled to the good or resigned to the bad. He paced more than he had planned, because being useful had become a form of training, and he found that his last lap had learned a lesson from all this generosity and kept a small joke back for him when he needed it.\n\nThere were bad nights. The kind with the bad dream that took all morning to shake off, the kind where Rowan asked if this was the worst thing that would ever happen to him and whether it had already happened and now everything else was an echo. There were good nights that were good in such an ordinary way he almost missed them, the kind where the food came out right and the show was exactly dumb enough and the window let in air without noise. There was a night when he showed up at Bart\u2019s door shaking because someone had stopped short ahead of him and he had braked and nothing happened and everything happened inside his body at once. They sat on the floor and let his nervous system do its electricity and then be done, and afterward he lay on the couch and fell asleep with his face toward the back like a child hiding, and Bart let his hand dangle to the floor and counted the breaths until they left the panic and reentered the general aeolian plane of the day.\n\nThe day after the letter, they took the dog to the park to tire him because neither of them had their own stamina in a form fit for public consumption. The dog performed joy at a level that would have embarrassed a different animal and the geese gave them a look that suggested legal action. Calling the dog back and having him actually come when they called gave both of them an unreasonable amount of confidence in the future of the species. They watched a small boy on a tricycle concentrate into a person in real time and both of them felt their throats behave oddly and didn\u2019t mention it. On the bridge, Bart leaned and pointed out a turtle that had decided to be important and Rowan said there were certain moments you could put in your pocket and this was one, and that had nothing to do with anything in particular and everything to do with the fact they were still finding reasons to put days on shelves.\n\nWhen Rowan said he wanted to go back to the track as an athlete and not as a man who stood near fences, he said it in the quiet of the living room with the noodle shop simmering below. Most of his fear had learned to speak slower by then, and the sentence came out like a chore he wanted to do because he liked how the floor felt afterward. The calendar didn\u2019t care about the drama; it had a line for a meet in Toronto that would attract everyone who had not yet gotten their qualifying time and everyone who was pretending not to care that they hadn\u2019t. Rinaldi raised an eyebrow at Bart in the way that asked a question and didn\u2019t pressure the answer. Bart said he wanted to run there because he wanted to be inside the noise and not outside it, and when he said it he thought he might be lying to himself and then, later, realized he wasn\u2019t.\n\nThey drove in separate cars on purpose because you can love a person and still need a commute to sort yourself into an athlete. The Toronto track felt like a bowl that had not quite learned its own size, and the blue seats made the day feel more official than it had a right to be. Rowan wore his kit with that new, complicated relationship to it\u2014they had gotten coffee together first and sat with their uniforms making them into versions of themselves twenty-year-old them could recognize. When he went to call room, his name sounded like a sentence he had already decided not to translate. He warmed up with a face that told other people to leave him alone and when he caught Bart\u2019s eye across the field, he let his mouth soften exactly at the corners and then pressed forward as if he had been launched.\n\nThe race was a race, not a morality play and not a poem. It did the thing that races do, which is ask you to be your idea of yourself very quickly and very publicly and with very little time to make corrections. Rowan moved with the patience of a man teaching his past self a lesson. He didn\u2019t take the rail like a dare and he didn\u2019t swing wide like a billboard; he sat where he meant to and he paid for nothing he didn\u2019t need. At nine hundred meters it looked like he might fall out of the back of the lead group and then his shoulders did the thing they do when he decides to be a problem, and he went, and the pack went with him, and the wind said something disrespectful and he ignored it, and he came down the last hundred meters with a face that was true because it was ugly and he leaned at the line because you always lean no matter what larger event the day thinks it\u2019s hosting. He didn\u2019t win and he didn\u2019t PR. He put down a time that would have looked like a bad date three months ago and now had the shine of victory.\n\nHe didn\u2019t look for Bart when he came off the line because for a moment he was someone else, and then he did and he found him and he let his head fall forward until his forehead pressed Bart\u2019s shoulder as if it were the finish line he had been aiming for. People around them clapped for the wrong reasons and no reasons and because they liked the noise, and they stepped away from that and into the tunnel where the light behaved itself. They didn\u2019t speak for a time that could have been two minutes or an hour, and when they did it was to say the exact random things that fill in the edges of a bigger thing\u2014water, socks, the way one spike always sits wrong on the fourth toe and how no one will ever fix that on a design level.\n\nDriving home, the radio lost its stations halfway and found new ones that played nothing he recognized. He rolled the window down on the 401 and let the wind punish him for choosing to be alive. In the right lane a truck pulled a small carnival ride that looked obscene out of context, and he had a little laugh at the idea that someone would roll into a parking lot somewhere and assemble joy with bolts. Back at the apartment, he laced his fingers into Rowan\u2019s hair and found that the flat places and the cowlicks had become a map he could read in the dark. They didn\u2019t make the evening into a ceremony; they ordered dumplings and burned the first batch in a way that made them laugh like schoolchildren. When they were done laughing, they were quiet without having to declare it.\n\nThe fund in the boy\u2019s name reached a number that someone had hoped it would and then it reached a number that scared everyone involved and they brought in a person who knew how to keep a thing from becoming a mess. Bart attended a meeting with a whiteboard and sat next to a woman who kept calm by tapping her pen and decided he loved her for how competent she looked in a cardigan. They talked about crosswalks and sight lines and timelines and how many volunteers it took to make a wish into a guardrail. Rowan sat in the corner with his cap on and answered questions when asked and not when not, and if you hadn\u2019t known who he was you would have thought he was a contractor who cared too much.\n\nSummer deepened into itself. The nights lasted longer than seemed reasonable and the mornings had to be pulled into being. They learned how to sleep next to each other without waking at every shift, a skill that felt like a medal no one would ever see. Bart started a silly tradition of buying the cheapest, ugliest postcards from a rack in a drugstore whenever he thought of Rowan while they were apart, and he wrote on them one ordinary sentence and mailed them from wherever he was. A card arrived from Windsor that said there was a dog in the infield who ignored the starter pistol and wasn\u2019t that a metaphor, and a card arrived from Guelph that said he had finally tried the egg salad at the cafeteria and regretted it, and a card arrived from Kitchener that said the barista had been kind to a man who ordered a coffee and then changed his mind and ordered tea three times. Rowan taped them to the inside of a cupboard door because the outside of doors got you in trouble.\n\nWhen the first storm of August rolled through, the city bared its undercarriage. The lights at Gaukel failed in the precise way that proved they were doing work even when they weren\u2019t, and a cop stood in the middle of the intersection with his arms out like a choir conductor for people who had never rehearsed. Bart watched from the window as drivers became students of a subject they had neglected, and he decided to go down to the street to see what made of itself when the instructions were taken away. He found Rowan there because of course he would, standing on the curb with his hands in his pockets like he was watching a friend on stage. They stood under the awning of the noodle shop and listened to rain hit pavement with the sound of applause for a show that had been called off.\n\n\u201cWhen the lights go out, people look at each other again,\u201d Rowan said, as if he had been practicing saying it. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that means anything except that I like watching them try.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the world is one long meet at a track that forgot to paint the start lines,\u201d Bart said, and he knew it was terrible and he let it be terrible and waited for the sneer he would have given himself five years ago.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re nice to look at,\u201d Rowan said into his shoulder, which was a place he had started to speak to more often. \u201cDo you want to go run in this or do you want to pretend to be people who have linen tea towels.\u201d\n\nThey went upstairs and didn\u2019t run. They dried off with towels so old the fabric had learned resignation and they cooked noodles with the windows open because the heat was nothing compared to the heat outside. He turned the radio to the station that always played the same blues song at half past the hour and they stood in the kitchen and swayed because anything more had too much choreography. He thought of the first time he had seen Rowan on a warm-up loop and how his brain had not known where to put him, and he thought of the last time he had seen Rowan cross a line and how his brain had put him in the only place it had left\u2014next to him, with a hand on his back asking nothing he didn\u2019t have to give.\n\nIf anyone had asked him what chapter of his life this was, he would have told them he didn\u2019t keep scripture around for that, and if anyone had asked him where this was going, he would have told them there were routes and distances he liked, but the only thing he trusted was putting on shoes and leaving the house and returning, and making sure he made it across streets with as much attention as he could find. The lamps over the water would still be there in the morning, and he would still count them not because it was magic but because it was useful. He went to bed with the smell of broth in his hair and Rowan\u2019s exhale against his neck and the knowledge that tomorrow he would lace up and do base work, and that, if he was lucky, would be enough to carry them to the next small thing that mattered.",

                              "content": "Tess\u2019s moving day began with a fight between the sky and the forecast, the white-box truck parked at the curb like it had been invented to misunderstand corners. Bart arrived early because he likes to impress furniture by acting as if it weighs less than it does, and Rowan showed up later in an old T-shirt with the sleeves cut off that made him look like he had been raised by track and field and a band tour. Their mother stood at the top of the stairs with a roll of painter\u2019s tape like she might label the air, and Ben held a box of mismatched mugs the way a man carries a trophy he is not certain he won. The dog barked at the dolly until introduced formally. Tess had a system written on a piece of paper that became a talisman and then pulp in her back pocket; she gave orders as if anyone had signed on to take them and no one minded because she had that talent of sounding like she knew where each piece belonged before the walls did. Rowan took the narrow couch with the dignity of someone who has known the humiliation of elevators, and Bart and Ben did the mattress like an argument they had decided to lose kindly. On the landing, Rowan paused and exchanged a glance with Bart that said he could carry a thing and also he could be carried; it was small and no one fell down the stairs.\n\nThey made three trips because no one knows what volume is until they find themselves staring into the belly of a truck. The new place had a front stoop that made Ben say the word character as if it were a minor illness and a door that stuck in a way only men of a certain age take personally. Inside, light made honest statements on the floorboards and the windows tried to be generous. Tess moved through it with the strange mix of reverence and arrogance you need to claim space. Their mother set down a bag of groceries like a spell for later. Rowan stood in the kitchen with a box labeled Misc Spoons, looked at a drawer, and then at Bart, and they had the brief marital debate of where you put things you do not understand. \u201cPut them where you expect them, not where you think respectable people would,\u201d Bart said, which sounded like a philosophy and made Tess groan and knock her shoulder into his.\n\nThey ate pizza off a flattened box because the plates were trapped behind hubris and bubble wrap. The dog discovered the sun spot near the balcony door and adopted it. Ben told the story of moving into his first apartment and sleeping on a twin mattress for three years because the hockey schedule made time behave like a hostile coworker, and their mother corrected the number of years by half and laughed with her mouth buttoned, the way she does when nostalgia tries something ambitious. There was a moment when the room tilted and nobody spilled it, the quiet acknowledgment that this new address came with the world as it was, not the last one. Rowan sat on the counter, ankles crossed, and watched Tess take ownership of the pantry, and it made something easy in him. He passed Bart the roll of tape and their fingers brushed and they let the fact of it sit there, unremarked, because intimacy that doesn\u2019t need applause is what you hope to earn.\n\nAfter, Bart and Rowan walked back to the noodle building because the truck had been returned and the sky had decided it was done threatening. They took the long way to give the day room. The intersection at Gaukel looked different in the way hair looks different only to people who know you; the new timing had been installed, a little more breathing built into the system, a leading interval that let feet touch asphalt before anything else claimed it. The city had hung a small laminated notice like a permission slip; someone had scribbled \u201cfinally\u201d in blue ink in the margin. Rowan touched his cap, a reflex he had acquired and didn\u2019t interrogate, and watched the hands flash and count like they were learning to hold a beat. A boy in a yellow shirt with a bike that still had training wheels waited without argument, and his mother put a hand on the back of his head like a lighthouse. It was ordinary in the way that is radical because it works.\n\nBack upstairs, Bart made coffee with the care of a person trying to earn a second cup. Rowan sat at the table and unfolded the schedule Rinaldi had sent like a fortune he did and did not want to learn. Nationals had settled themselves on the calendar with their blunt intention. The team chat hummed with the dumb bravado that is how some men admit to fear. Rowan had choices to make that looked like either courage or delusion depending on what angle you took. He suspended the decision between two fingers as if he could keep gravity from finding it by refusing to name it. \u201cIf I go,\u201d he said, \u201cI go because I can finish, even if finishing looks like a different verb than it did last year. I am not going to line up to fail for someone else\u2019s appetite.\u201d Bart nodded, because agreeing is not assent until it is, and he wanted Rowan to know he would show up for whichever version of yes it became.\n\nWork at the warehouse learned their new rhythms like a friend tolerating a baby. Monique maintained a benevolent dictatorship and fed them muffins only on days she declared worth the sugar. She told Bart that carrying someone else\u2019s dresser was good cross-training if he didn\u2019t let the corners get cocky. He told her about Tess\u2019s triumphant cupboard arrangement and she told him that proving to yourself you can make a home is almost as hard as making dinner after a bad day. A guy from receiving said he\u2019d seen Bart\u2019s \u201cboyfriend\u201d on TV and slurred it with the cheeriness of someone who wanted to be on the right side of the joke, and Bart said, \u201cYou probably did,\u201d with a fund of patience that surprised him. Later, in the break room, Monique slid him an orange and said, \u201cHeard anything you want to talk about badly?\u201d and he shook his head and thanked her for the citrus and for not pretending to be neutral when she wasn\u2019t.\n\nOn a hot Wednesday, the athletics office hosted the LPI ribbon-cutting because cities like to pretend their internal organs have ceremonies. There were fold-up chairs and a lectern and a microphone that alternately behaved and didn\u2019t. The mayor said words like proactive and safety culture, and a counselor said the word pilot in a way that let them keep everything temporary if they needed to. Rowan stood with his cap low and his sunglasses on and the world ignored him until it didn\u2019t. Someone at the back hissed what sounded like murderer, and someone up front clapped both hands little and hard like they wanted to drown difference with noise, and the thing passed over them like weather. When they asked if he wanted to say anything, Rowan shook his head and then surprised himself by stepping forward anyway. He said he was grateful people who build things were building them with pedestrians in mind, and that if they needed a volunteer to count seconds, he had time, and he said the boy\u2019s name once because always. He said nothing about forgiveness and everything about remembering and then stepped back. When he sat down, Bart\u2019s knee knocked into his on purpose, a tether in a public room.\n\nThe brand people called in the same breath as the LPI announcement because timing is a sense only money trusts. They wanted Rowan for a shoot that would tell a story about resilience and sport and urban life and whatever else they could stretch into a narrative arc. They had mockups with the color palettes already chosen and a script someone had written to sound spontaneous. Rowan let the call unspool and asked the questions a person asks when they want to pretend they might say yes, and then hung up and stared at the ceiling like he was trying to locate a leak in his principles. \u201cDo it if you want to buy more time for the fund,\u201d Bart said, and surprised himself with how the sentence didn\u2019t taste like compromise. \u201cDon\u2019t do it if the idea of your face on a bus makes you want to live in a shoebox. Do it if it buys you a day where you get to say no to something worse. Don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s noble. Don\u2019t punish yourself for the part of you that likes lights pointed at your bones.\u201d\n\nThey fought anyway, not because of the brand, but because the fatigue found them defenseless at the sink that night. Rowan said he didn\u2019t want to keep being a headline and Bart said no one wants to be a headline unless they control the font, and Rowan told him he sounded like someone trying to therapize instead of love, and Bart told him he was being asked not to be honest by a man who had built a career out of honesty with his legs. The fight had old shapes\u2014the moment when a voice rises and you watch yourself from the corner of the room and choose whether to be better than your reflexes, the moment when one person goes quiet not to win but to keep the roof on. They stopped themselves in the middle like a hand on a stove and Rowan swore and put his forehead to the cabinet and Bart stepped into him until they were a stupid statue. \u201cIf you do it, I will take the pictures off my route,\u201d Bart said, and made a stupid face to blunt the sincerity. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, I will make fun of the shoes anyway.\u201d\n\nNationals came up like a dare and the train got him there, because driving into a city with track energy is a way to resent everything for no good reason. The hotel was a vertical collection of nervous systems. The lobby smelled like instant coffee and cologne and ambition. Call room staff moved with the serene bureaucracy of people who could break your day for a living and choose not to. Bart shook hands with men he had spent winters resenting and summers warming up next to, and they all pretended time wasn\u2019t weird. Rinaldi issued instructions with the calm of a man performing mouth-to-mouth on panic. Tess texted a photograph of a crooked picture frame in her new hallway and a note that said, \u201cI\u2019m going to leave it like this forever. Do well.\u201d\n\nRowan warmed up on the outer ring with rhythms that had learned not to accelerate without permission. His eyes had decided to be selfish, tracking only what they needed. He ran past Bart without stopping and without avoiding and the small movement of a hand flicked acknowledgment, their language for not making a scene where a scene would be a lie. When his heat got called, he shook his arms out like they\u2019d been asked to stand for too long in one position and took the rail like he wasn\u2019t apologizing to it. The gun was a question mark turned sideways and then the field became an answer he could tolerate. He sat fifth and then sixth and then fifth again. The last lap was that place where you have to pick which version of yourself to honor. He didn\u2019t win and he didn\u2019t fall apart. He ended with enough left in him to hate that fact for a second and then forgive it. The time was clean and human. The bowed heads on the finish line belonged to men he had to share breath with and he did.\n\nBy the rails, when the wave of sound had receded to a measurable number of decibels, Bart found him and gave him water and didn\u2019t say the sentence he\u2019d rehearsed because it was wrong in his mouth. Rowan tipped his head back, mouth open, animal, and then looked at him with pupils like absolutions. \u201cI didn\u2019t check for you,\u201d he said, as if confessing something huge. \u201cI ran and then I was done, and I liked being done, and I liked knowing you were here like furniture. I mean that as a compliment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take furniture,\u201d Bart said. \u201cI want to be a lamp.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Rowan said, and laughed a noise that shook something out of his chest. \u201cYou already are. One-two-three-four\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFive-six,\u201d Bart finished, and they didn\u2019t make it into something cute because it already was and they let it be.\n\nAfter his own heat, after a qualifying time that landed him with the precise satisfaction of a correct diagnosis, after the shower that felt like absolution and the black coffee that tasted like penance, Bart found himself in a corridor with a wall of glass that turned the outside trees into a watercolor. He leaned his head to the cool and watched strangers do the kinds of small kindnesses you only notice when you are not being asked for anything\u2014someone held a door with their foot because their hands were full, someone handed over a hair elastic without asking for it back, two men laughed and pretended they hadn\u2019t. He was tired only in the body in the way that matters, the mind left free to wander without malicious intent. When Rowan stepped into his peripheral, he didn\u2019t even have to look up. It felt like the hours after a storm when you realize the roof held.\n\nThey promised, and kept, one night without any talk of times or lattices of grief. They walked a couple of anonymous blocks and found a Greek place with a blue sign and a waiter who cared exactly enough. They ate lamb with their fingers and let oil baptize their knuckles. They argued gently about whether oregano is a bully. They watched an old couple share a plate and the old man\u2019s hand hover near his wife\u2019s wrist like there was still something urgent to catch. They tried very hard not to talk about what their old would look like and failed quietly in complementary ways. Back in the hotel lobby, an athlete in a black hoodie asked for a photo with Rowan without asking for permission for the person standing next to him to have a life, and Rowan put his arm around a stranger in the practiced way and Bart moved to the side and didn\u2019t take offense at his own invisibility because he had chosen it.\n\nSeptember began to consider whether it had earned a reputation yet. The heat backed off and the city remembered it owned sweaters. The barista switched the chalkboard to a maple latte and scowled at Bart like it was his fault. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, and she said, \u201cGood.\u201d At the warehouse, schedules went back to something like routine, which was almost suspicious. Monique started saying winter prep like she was casting a spell. Rinaldi made noises about base like other men say taxes and got out a spreadsheet he would pretend was a napkin. Tess hung the crooked frame and refused to fix it, and when their mother visited she pretended not to notice and then confessed she liked it better wrong.\n\nThe fund board had its first argument in earnest, which Rowans discovered meant it was a real board. They disagreed over whether to spend money fast where it would be seen or slowly where it would work invisibly. The cardigan woman wanted ten smaller projects to reduce harm in ten places so people would look up and realize not dying is an infrastructure choice. A man with a good tie wanted one new mid-block crossing with everyone\u2019s names on it. Rowan recused himself from some of the smiling and then put his hand up in the way he had learned to, and said he didn\u2019t know how to write his name on anything without making a lie, but he could live with a plaque that listed only verbs. He suggested three words that made him want to die a little when he heard them in his own voice: look, slow, yield. Bart, sitting in the back with a notepad, wrote them down with the tenderness you usually reserve for the way someone you love pronounces a difficult word.\n\nThere was the day Rowan called from a parking lot because he had outlasted his first panic since therapy, and triumphed by not trying to wrestle it into anything heroic. He said it had arrived like weather and departed like weather and in between he had sat in his car and noticed the stitching on the steering wheel. He told Bart he had counted the stitches and they had helped. Bart told him he liked that the world was literally sewn and then apologized for how earnest he sounded, and Rowan said, \u201cI can handle your earnestness as long as I never have to see your poetry.\u201d They laughed in the same key and a woman walking her dog outside the car looked in with a brief, polite curiosity like she\u2019d just spotted birds.\n\nRinaldi\u2019s coat came off one afternoon in a gesture Bart had not witnessed in a decade. It was not an omen, just a concession to warmth. Underneath he was a man built out of stories and the tired violence of delicious food. He called Bart to the bench at the end of a workout while the geese negotiated a treaty with teenagers over the use of the grass. He said the words assistant and stipend and spring in an order that felt like an invitation across a threshold Bart hadn\u2019t known he had been standing at. He said he didn\u2019t make assistants because it was work to make a person permanent, and he said he would make Bart one for the winter if Bart wanted to find out whether being responsible for other people\u2019s breathing made him feel bigger or smaller. Bart answered like he answers the only questions that matter\u2014smiling without showing teeth and saying yes, and then admitting he was scared of anything that added the word always to his life.\n\nThey told Rowan\u2019s mother, and it felt like a small mountain that had never been on any map. It was a simple call on a Sunday, sunlight making bars on the floor between his bed and the wall. She asked him if he was eating enough because that is the way she knows to open most doors with him, and he said yes, and then he said he had someone who made him eat when he forgot and he heard her make a soft sound in the hinge of her mouth that let him picture her hand finding her throat like she wanted to keep all her careful words from falling out. She asked his name and then said it twice, measuring it, and then asked if he wanted to tell his father whom she called later because parents still have their own marriages even when their children take up all the light. It was not a coming out so much as a coming into, and he found that his lungs had been making a fist for too long and could relax now that they were being watched for something other than performance.\n\nThey went to a small town meet in October because runners are ridiculous and so are their calendars. The field smelled like apples from an invisible tart at a concession stand and the track had a crack in lane eight that made purists suck their teeth. Rowan did tempo work in lane two because the rhythm wanted him and not the other way around. Bart stood with a stopwatch and pretended it mattered. He shouted splits like a man in a movie and Rowan stuck out his tongue on the third rep to make him laugh and almost tripped because even joy makes you vulnerable. After, they sat on the grass and watched kids learn how to throw javelins wrong and then right, and watched a coach tell a kid\u2019s mother how long it would take to see if this was a thing and not just an afternoon. Bart leaned back on his elbows and let the season lay down next to him with a little sigh.\n\nWhen the cold came for real, it brought with it the quiet that makes conversation less necessary and more precise. They put away shorts and pretended to like beanies and rediscovered the athletic beauty of socks. The noodle shop downstairs started serving a stew as if they were apologizing on behalf of the air. Bart began to carry a coaching notebook with him that acquired the exact right amount of grease on the cover. Rowan bought a lamp at a thrift store because it was ugly and therefore no one would want it, and because the shade made the room look like someone had thought about where the light ought to sit. He sent Bart a photograph of the bulb waking the shade and typed, One-two-three-four, and Bart wrote back, Five-six-seven-eight, and neither of them decided that made them corny.\n\nThe first snow arrived like a dare and an apology. They ran anyway, because this is the contract, and the sound underfoot changed into the interesting squeak that tells you something about traction you cannot make useful. The geese left reluctantly and one stayed behind because it had a lot to say. Tess hosted what she called an adult party and which was actually chili and a playlist and three kinds of seltzer; their parents came and sat on the couch like people visiting a museum exhibit about their children\u2019s adulthood. Ben and Rowan stood on the balcony for a minute too long, two men whose bodies had learned similar disciplines in different languages. Ben told him some small true thing about breathing at the blue line and Rowan told him some small true thing about the first two hundred meters in the cold and they were pleased with each other for not lying.\n\nOn a night when the rink at Victoria Park had not yet opened and the lamps looked like they might consider their reflection, Bart brought Rowan to the bridge and counted in his head because the habit was a form of prayer he could do in front of another person without embarrassing himself. They stood hip to hip and said nothing for the kind of long that belongs to people who are not afraid of silence. Somewhere in the dark a kid laughed the way kids do when a parent lets them stay up late for no good reason. Rowan shoved his hands deeper into his pockets and then took one out and looked at it like he had found it in a coat he didn\u2019t know he owned. He threaded his fingers through Bart\u2019s, palm to palm, and it felt like the kind of grip you use to pull someone up a hill and not let go until they\u2019re over the lip.\n\nLater, in the kitchen, Rowan found the only good knife without looking and cut an orange in quarters with the competence of a man who has few kitchen skills and treats those he has like medals. He handed Bart a slice and it ran down their wrists and they shivered and laughed and then the radio played some song that had survived a decade of being played badly at weddings, and Bart said, \u201cWe\u2019re doing fine,\u201d and Rowan said, \u201cWe are.\u201d They ate the rest of the orange in a silence that was full of yeses and small, unshowy promises, and when they went to bed they let their feet find each other first because it seemed modest to start at the edge and work in.\n\nWinter was a new training block and also a new house rule. They made soup and missed workouts and made them up and did not bother to count. Rinaldi taught him how to teach high knees to freshmen who wanted to skip steps and wanted the end without the drill and Bart learned how to watch an ankle the way you watch a sentence for where it wants to break. Rowan learned how to sleep again in a body that did not clutch itself all night to avoid falling. Tess learned that the crooked frame made her mother itch and kept it anyway. The fund built two crossings and a mural with verbs, and the cardigan woman cried without making a scene when she saw a kid push a button with severe ceremony. The lights at Gaukel got a new sign that said, thanks, and no one could agree on for what, which felt like the right lack of consensus.\n\nOne morning, before the sky had decided to be anything at all, Bart woke because a horn sounded far away like it was in his childhood. He lay there and watched the shape of the apartment change as the streetlight did its slow cycle, and he thought about last winter\u2019s man, that version of himself who had not known about the shape of a stranger\u2019s hand and the particular ache behind his own right knee that was grief and not injury. He thought of the way Rowan looked at a finish line like it was a gate that required a specific password this time only he knew. He thought of how he would teach a kid to trust their toes again. He thought of little things he could do that weren\u2019t little\u2014answer the phone, eat the eggs, lace the shoe, walk to the lights and wait like a person who has time.\n\nHe got up and put the kettle on long before the noodle shop downstairs would consider opening, and he stood in the kitchen with cold on his ankles and listened to the apartment stretch. Rowan rolled, a dark collection of vowels under the duvet, and muttered something about eight that sounded like a promise to no one in particular.
