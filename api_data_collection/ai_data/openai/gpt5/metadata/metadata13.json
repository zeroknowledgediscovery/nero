     "novel_text": "They called him Stud because it made the lads at the bar laugh, and because he worked mornings at Milton Meadows where the horses breathed fog into the cold air and hammered the mud with their glossy hooves. The nickname stuck once a hen party from Wolverton wandered into the pub on a Thursday and the bride-to-be dared him to tango amid a tangle of stools and a jukebox with a stuck volume dial. He obliged with an exaggerated rose clenched in his teeth\u2014the rose was a napkin, the teeth were imperfect\u2014and he dipped the bride until her veil touched the floor. Someone clapped. Someone wolf-whistled. Tariq, who cut hair and liked to narrate whatever Nate Ellison did, shouted, \u201cStud\u2019s in the building, ladies,\u201d and that was that. Not Nate, not Nathan, but Stud, a word meant to tease that sounded like a badge if he squinted at it.\n\nMorning light was thin, chalked across a sky that still had bruises of night when Nate, boots clumped and stiff with dried clay, crossed the yard to the tack room. The smell met him first\u2014oil, leather, old straw, and that ammonia tang the winter cold couldn\u2019t cut. He liked it. The smell meant work, meant rhythm, meant something to wrangle. He set the muck fork against the wall and paused to listen. Horses shift differently from one another, he'd learned. You could tell which one was stamping in the far stall by the impatience in the thump. Dynamo, big bay with a neck like a proud crane? He stamped in measured, angry thuds. Lovey, the skewbald mare, trilled her lips when she was annoyed and pawed delicate at the straw as if trying to tidy it into an apology.\n\n\u201cHold your horses,\u201d he told them, because he knew they rolled their eyes when humans used that one. He felt the day gather and lean on him. He leaned back. Habit.\n\nIn the second stall from the tack room door, Dynamo tossed his head when Nate appeared, the whites of his eyes thin and bright. \u201cEasy,\u201d Nate murmured, slow in his hands and quick in his thoughts. He\u2019d seen the way Dynamo took to new things\u2014ears pinpricked, muscles coiled. The first week the horse had come in, a kid had carried a rainbow umbrella across the yard, and Dynamo had lifted on two legs like the sky had punched him.\n\n\u201cAngry man,\u201d Tariq liked to joke, slinging an arm over Nate\u2019s shoulders when he stopped by after the morning shift. \u201cYou get one word wrong with him, he\u2019ll write a letter to the editor.\u201d Dynamo didn\u2019t need words to file complaints. He had hooves. He had weight.\n\nNate mucked, fed, watered. He let the rhythm take him. He counted two measures for scoop, one for toss, one for rake, the pattern that had entered him years ago in a gymnasium with a too-shiny floor. He didn\u2019t talk about that part much. In Milton, you were a fighter or a footballer or someone always just about to be okay. A man who danced made people recalibrate their jokes. So Nate danced in the early, when horses took his beat as a friendly thing, and he danced past closing in the slow stretch of his kitchen when the kettle cooled and his tea thought about skinning over.\n\nHe kept it mostly to himself. Not entirely because of the jokes. There was also the way the music reached under his ribs and flicked the switch in him that said move, and he felt private about that, the climate under the ribs. If it were a landscape on a map, it would be labelled Here be dragons in red, and a little sea serpent would be writhing there, everything muscular and glossy.\n\nThat morning he finished just before eight. He checked on Lovey\u2014who sneezed into his shoulder and left a wet smudge\u2014and he let his fingers rest beneath the velvet bone of Dynamo's jaw, where the pulse galloped even when the horse stood statue-still. \u201cIt ain\u2019t all bad,\u201d he told him. \u201cSome things don\u2019t want to eat you.\u201d\n\nOutside, the frost had decided to be decorative and laced the fence-rails with a look of expensive cake. The pond had a thin white skin. Nate\u2019s breath went out and came back as a ghost that didn\u2019t know where else to haunt. He adjusted his scarf, a present from his sister Lyla that was far too bright for the sober fields\u2014acid green, would prompt cows to file formal complaints\u2014and walked toward the lane.\n\nHis phone buzzed in his pocket with a feeling like a bee trapped under a glass. He fished it out with his thick gloves between his teeth because he\u2019d learned that leaving messages unread made his chest fill with moths. On the screen, a notification sunrise: Congratulations Nate! You\u2019ve been shortlisted for the finalists\u2019 showcase of Dance/Drive: City Edition.\n\nHe stopped walking. He didn\u2019t even feel the cold, for five heartbeats. Then the cold came back with interest, a tax on surprise. He read it again and again, the words refusing to believe they\u2019d been sent to someone like him. Dance/Drive had started out niche, late-night on very early cable. An all-styles competition without the glitter or sob stories, the kind that takes place in repurposed car parks and above abandoned hardware shops. It had gotten bigger, then bigger still, until it finally landed on a streaming platform with a logo everyone knew. And now this season the City Edition was coming to Milton Keynes, a chance at the massive stage in the Centre:MK with lighting rigs like alien skeletons and seats like the curved teeth of a smile.\n\n\u201cStud?\u201d Tariq\u2019s voice drifted from the barber shop doorway across the lane. Tariq was sweeping hair into a tactical mountain he\u2019d later conquer with a dustpan. He wore his apron and his look for customers, which was glossy and leaned back. \u201cWhat\u2019s that face?\u201d\n\n\u201cSpam,\u201d Nate lied, then failed at it immediately. He crossed the road, boots loud. \u201cNah. It\u2019s\u2014Tariq. They\u2019re going to put me in the finals showcase. The finals, mate.\u201d\n\nThe broom froze. \u201cDon\u2019t wind me up, I\u2019m too delicate in the mornings.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome here, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d He held the phone out. He needed somebody else\u2019s eyes to confirm the words, in case his had been faulty all these years. Tariq read. He tried to give the phone back and missed Nate\u2019s palm twice. \u201cBoy,\u201d he said finally, a brand of joy that sounded like a warning. \u201cBoy. Boy.\u201d\n\nNate laughed. It came out of him like he\u2019d swallowed something fizzy and was now a bottle with a bad idea. \u201cYou\u2019re going to overboy yourself and fall over,\u201d he said.\n\nTariq put the broom against the wall like it tired him to look at it. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell two people. That\u2019s all. Just two.\u201d He lifted his hand. \u201cNo, three. Four. Five would be vulgar.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone yet,\u201d Nate said, with a reflex that came from years of not wanting to wave at possible joy in case it turned around and vanished into a lane of fog. \u201cThey might change their minds. Get my name wrong. Mix me up with someone else. They\u2019ll be like, we meant to say \u2018Matey Ellie-something who can\u2019t dance,\u2019 apologies for the confusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey spelt your name right,\u201d Tariq said. \u201cYou\u2019re famous now, Stud. I\u2019m going to charge you more for a fade.\u201d\n\nNate grinned to show he didn\u2019t mind the razzing, and to hide how his hands had started shaking. He tucked the phone into his pocket, like a rabbit he hoped would not wriggle free.\n\nWhen he got home, his mother was at the table with a pen cap behind her teeth and the Morning Citizen spread in front of her. Janine Ellison was small and endless, the kind of person who had a voice that knew how to reach its own echoes and bring them back. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said, without looking up. \u201cMake tea.\u201d\n\nHe brushed her hair, out of habit more than necessity. \u201cI smell like a damp accident,\u201d he warned her. \u201cTea will be contaminated.\u201d\n\n\u201cTea is one of nature\u2019s disinfectants,\u201d she said. \u201cSo is a biscuit. I read this somewhere and I refuse to check if it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou read it in your heartbeat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my what?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d He put the kettle on and stared at the old streaks of lime down its side like the rings of a tree. He had promised himself he\u2019d tell her after tea, when the handle of the mug was warm against his palm and the kitchen had earned its easier mood.\n\n\u201cLyla\u2019s at school?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cUnless they changed the date while we weren\u2019t looking.\u201d Janine circled something in the paper with such precision you\u2019d think it was an exam answer that would earn a scholarship. \u201cWhat is Park View Gardens? Is that the one with the murder hedges? Who murdered whom?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hedges murdered the gardener,\u201d Nate said, obeying the ritual. He waited. He felt the words a little queue inside him. She looked up, no pen cap now, her gaze steady.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened,\u201d she said in the tone she reserved for when she knew something had happened. \u201cGood or bad?\u201d\n\nHe poured the tea a little too quickly. \u201cI\u2026 I got an email. Dance/Drive. You know, that dance thing. They watched my clip. They want me for the finals showcase. The one at Centre.\u201d\n\nThere was a short silence that felt like the house inhaled. Janine\u2019s chair scraped. She stood and her face did a thing that only a few faces can do, the thing where you\u2019re trying to appear measured because you are the mother, and your child is watching, so you must be the horizon. It lasted a second. Then she was laughing and her hand was over her mouth and there were tears in her eyes that she had chosen to classify as morning allergies. \u201cOh, my boy,\u201d she said. \u201cMy love. Look at you.\u201d\n\nHe looked at himself; he was muddy and he\u2019d nicked his knuckle on Dynamo\u2019s stall latch and there was straw in his hair like confetti from a cheap wedding. \u201cI need a wash,\u201d he said, because sometimes you say trivial things when the room swims. Your mouth needs somewhere to put the air.\n\n\u201cYou need a crown,\u201d Janine said. \u201cYou\u2019ve needed a crown for a long time.\u201d Her eyes went somewhere he couldn\u2019t follow, the past where his father stood with his hand on the door and the car idling and a suitcase in the back that weighed more than any suitcase should. She reached towards him, then put her hand back down, then reached again. She never was sure with him. He wasn\u2019t sure either. \u201cWhen is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say three weeks. Rehearsals next week. They pair us up with partners this afternoon at registration. It all moves fast, I think. Like a blender.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you be all right? Your knees.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy knees love me very much,\u201d he said, because he didn\u2019t tell her about the nights when ice packs became his small gods. He drank his tea too quickly. He wished the kitchen window were a television and it could show him the future, even just the opening credits.\n\nHe washed and changed. The stained mirror above the sink did its best; it had a generous soul. He looked like what he was: twenty-four, tall, not as handsome as the nickname suggested but not far off either, with a face that had a habit of being open even when he consciously drew shutters down. He had shoulders that had carried hay bales and his mother\u2019s grief in equal measures, and arms that remembered choreography the way some arms remember bruises. He put on the clean jeans, the better jacket with the elbow patches, the trainers that made him quick. He examined the scarf and decided it could retire for the day.\n\nOn the bus into the centre, he sat by the window and let Milton roll out as if someone were unscrolling it from a high shelf. The big shopping centre hummed in the distance, the mirrored glass like a promise that a person could be more than three streets and a habit. The bus passed the indoor ski slopes, the boxy offices with their sensible blinds, the little parks with benches named after people whose families missed them publicly. He felt the machine of the city under him, not just cars but something slower and more complicated: ambition out for a walk. He got off at the stop where everyone got off or on, near the artificial lake that had ideas above its station.\n\nThe registration hall had been a conference room and would be again. For now it was all black fabric and cables disguised as snakes, a low stage, propped lights, a table with a line. Nate took a breath and got in line. The room smelled of coffee and hairspray and nerves. A poster with a logo told him he belonged here if he could read. He read it slowly. Belonging is a word that moves its own furniture.\n\n\u201cName?\u201d the girl at the table asked him when it was his turn. She had cheeks that made dimples when she concentrated, a pencil behind her ear like a cartoonist.\n\n\u201cNate Ellison,\u201d he said. His voice tried to be casual and overshot. \u201cI sent the clip. It was the warehouse one with the\u2026 with the yellow ladder.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, ladder guy,\u201d she said, consulting a list. \u201cWe gave you bonus points for not falling off and suing us. Okay, Nate. Your partner assignment is in here.\u201d She slid an envelope across the table. He wanted to tell her that her hands were steady in a generous way, but he didn\u2019t. \u201cRehearsal schedule\u2019s in the envelope too. Tech will make you sign seventeen forms about electrocution.\u201d\n\n\u201cElectrocution and being electrocuted,\u201d Nate said. \u201cDifferent brands.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh.\u201d She smiled the dimples again. \u201cThere\u2019s a vending machine outside with the good crisps. Everyone will tell you it's broken. It's not. It just needs to be slapped with the left hand.\u201d\n\nWhen he stepped away, the envelope in his hand weighed more than it could. He put his thumb under the flap and hesitated. He wanted to remember this second\u2014the one where something unknown was still perfectly shaped by its mystery. He told himself to move. He tore. He spilled paper.\n\nHe read the name. Maya Choudhury. He said it under his breath to taste it. He recognized it. He had seen her on screens, the local hip-hop phenom with a way of making gravity jealous. She danced like electricity learned to be a person. He\u2019d seen a clip months ago of her in a car park near the hospital, stomping and slicing through music that sounded like an alarm softened in velvet. Seventeen years old then, maybe eighteen now. He felt both relief and the tickle of intimidation.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s good,\u201d someone said over his shoulder, a voice like shoelaces being tied. He turned. The speaker was a woman maybe fifty, hair pulled back in a stern bun that didn\u2019t believe in whimsy, eyes that had measured many stages and found them wanting. \u201cMaya.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t know why he felt compelled to explain himself. \u201cI don\u2019t usually do\u2014well\u2014I do some styles, and I\u2019m fine with hip-hop, not fine like fine fines, but.\u201d He ran out of words and stood in the bright jungle of his own hands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Anya,\u201d the woman said. Not a smile. Not a frown. Something like the pause in between. \u201cI teach Maya sometimes. I also tell her off. Are you the boy from the warehouse?\u201d\n\n\u201cLadder guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou looked better with the ladder,\u201d she said, not unkindly. \u201cYou will have to keep up. She can be a little storm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good in weather,\u201d he said. She tipped her head, considering him as if he were a piece of furniture someone had dragged in and she wasn\u2019t yet sure where it should go.\n\n\u201cMaya is late,\u201d Anya said. \u201cShe has school. Or she is pretending to have school. Both can be true. If she makes a joke about detention, you must laugh.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it funny?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d She waited. \u201cThat was a joke.\u201d She turned as someone called her name.\n\nNate found a chair along the wall and sat. Dancers stretched in the middle of the floor, bodies performing math. A boy in a silver hoodie leapt, touched his toes midair, landed. A woman in a red dress that defied the usual rules of physics did a slow hip isolation that could move tides. The air in the room had bits of anxiety in it, like glitter you never quite clean up. He found himself scanning for her. He had only seen her through pixels, the way a child in a small town watches the news and wonders how cities are lit. When she arrived, he knew before anyone said. Her hair was in two long plaits down her back, her backpack was one of those with patches and pride. She had a pen behind her ear, like the girl at the table, but hers had leaked a little, in a way that looked like a signature.\n\n\u201cNate,\u201d she said, crossing to him as if the room were a field she owned. \u201cI watched your clip. You did that thing with the chair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chair was tired,\u201d he said. \u201cI helped it sit down.\u201d It came out easier than he\u2019d expected. Her grin was quick, a slanted line that looked like handwriting. \u201cMaya?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaya,\u201d she agreed, and stuck out her hand. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late. I got hijacked by physics. It wanted to fight today.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you win?\u201d\n\n\u201cPartial victory. The teacher says I don\u2019t show my working. Which is true of many parts of my life.\u201d She dropped her bag and the pen followed, skittering under a row of folding chairs like a mouse. \u201cAnya is watching, as usual. She\u2019ll pretend she\u2019s not. She\u2019ll tell me to stretch my feet and my mind. She\u2019s right. It\u2019s annoying.\u201d\n\nThey bent over the form together, sleeves nearly touching, shoulders learning each other\u2019s slope. The form asked them to list injuries, allergies, fears. Maya wrote hay on a line and looked up at him. \u201cAre you hay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am at least twenty percent hay at any given time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re allergic?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot properly. Just enough that I sneeze when I pretend to be a horse. It\u2019s useful socially.\u201d She squinted at him. \u201cAre you the Stud?\u201d\n\nHe waited a second too long. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014some people call me that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, Stud,\u201d she said, her grin again. \u201cSorry. I like calling people things they\u2019re not entirely sure they want to be called. It\u2019s a hobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people like tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cYou like identity crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d She pushed her hair back. \u201cLook, I can do the fast stuff. That\u2019s my thing. You can do the\u2014what did you call it in your clip? The roll?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Cuban roll,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fan. And that thing where your feet don\u2019t tell you they\u2019re moving but then they are, and it\u2019s too late to ask to be slowed down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be good,\u201d she said with a conviction that made the air change shape. He believed her before he allowed himself to agree. \u201cWe\u2019ll mix. Make new soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t mix all soups,\u201d he said. \u201cTomato and vegetable is fine. Minestrone and lemon chicken is a warcrime.\u201d\n\n\u201cArrest me.\u201d She bounced on her toes, a small bright chime of joy in motion. \u201cShow me your basic.\u201d\n\nHe stood. He didn\u2019t warm up properly because nerves are warm by themselves. He took a breath that went down where it needed to. He took the first weight on the ball of his foot, the way he\u2019d been taught in that old gymnasium by a woman with a sharp eye like a needle and a hand that could correct your posture and your soul. He moved against the idea of a drum. He felt the room settle its watchful eyes on him and then he stopped noticing. Music didn\u2019t have to be audible. He carried it, a private radio.\n\nWhen he looked up, Maya was watching him with her head tipped and her mouth small and thoughtful. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cOkay, you can stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to anyway,\u201d he said, and she laughed. Across the room, Anya pretended to frown at something else. The boy in the silver hoodie clapped lightly. Nate\u2019s hands stopped shaking. It happened slowly, like weather changing.\n\nThey rehearsed for an hour. They learned the way they would argue\u2014Maya quick, a stack of ideas and arms; Nate methodical, stubborn, a tendency to repeat until he felt the idea settle into the bones. She teased him and he let her. He corrected her weight transfer and she let him. When they had a rough eight counts that didn\u2019t offend either of them, they looked at it like it was a child they\u2019d made in a science experiment.\n\n\u201cThat bit,\u201d Maya said, pointing to where her shoulder sat under his hand like a bird under a roof. \u201cDo we want it to be romantic? Or\u2014what\u2019s the opposite of romantic? Practical?\u201d\n\n\u201cHydraulic,\u201d he offered. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it hydraulic. People like romance until it leaks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re weird,\u201d she said with approval. \u201cI like it.\u201d She fished in her backpack and brought up a bottle of water with stickers on it\u2014No bad vibes\u2014but all the bad vibes were, in fact, invited. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty-four.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrandad,\u201d she said, and avoided his wrist when he went to flick at her plait. \u201cKidding. Only a bit. You\u2019re tall. That\u2019s good. People think tall is better until tall falls over. Then everyone laughs, and you can\u2019t be angry because you deserve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve fallen?\u201d\n\n:She looked away, quick. \u201cOnce, at a battle. Not a big one. My foot did a thing and then my face did a thing and then my pride did a thing. It was educational.\u201d\n\n\u201cEducation is overrated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that. I have an exam tomorrow. If you jinx me I will choreograph my revenge.\u201d Her phone buzzed. She glanced. \u201cMy mother will want pictures of you to cross-reference with her danger database.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I dangerous?\u201d\n\nShe considered him. \u201cYour elbows are a menace. Other than that, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThey spilled out of the rehearsal hall at the end of the hour into a corridor that had been decorated by someone with a tight budget and a fondness for maroon. People were talking in that special way people talk when they\u2019ve survived something small together\u2014louder than necessary, words bumping into each other and apologizing. \u201cTea?\u201d Nate asked, because afterwards you drink something. He\u2019d learned to build rituals out of whatever he could hold.\n\n\u201cI have to be at school,\u201d Maya said, which he suspected was the truth, but she held his gaze and added, \u201cBut that sounds like an invitation. Raincheck.\u201d\n\n\u201cRaincheck,\u201d he said, a word that made less sense the more he thought it. He watched her go until she turned at the end of the corridor and did a little ridiculous bow he wasn\u2019t supposed to see.\n\nWhen he got outside, the afternoon had arranged itself into a thin and bright shape. He breathed and the breath had new width. He texted Tariq: Partner is Maya. He added a fire emoji because he had recently learned to use emojis for punctuation, something Lyla had mocked him for with a kindness that still stung. Tariq texted back sixteen faces with hearts for eyes and one eggplant that was probably an accident and then of course, not an accident at all.\n\nOn the bus home, he took the long way, the one that skirted the leisure plaza and then cut past the old Fishermead houses with their straight lines and persistent laundry. He got off two stops early because the sky was doing something and he wanted to be under it. He cut down by the allotments where the old men grew things bigger than science suggests, passed the fence with the painted dragons his sister had helped do with the youth club, and reached the meadow where the path narrows and the river does its own choosing. He could have been religious sometimes. Not about God, necessarily, but about the river, and the way the horses stood on the far side with their heads low and their ribs moving, and the way winter sunlight makes a promise it keeps in a small way.\n\nHe found Jessa by the gate, bundled in a coat that went down to her shins like a second, tougher skin. She was a friend from childhood, the kind that could tell him to stop without making him stop liking her. She smoked, always, as if she owed herself that small fire. She worked nights at the printing depot and had the schedule of a bat. \u201cYou\u2019re radiant,\u201d she said when she saw him, smoke curling like punctuation. \u201cWhy is that? Did you fight a man and win?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d he started, and didn\u2019t have to finish. Jessa squinted, then exhaled hard enough to put out a candle.\n\n\u201cOh, you got it,\u201d she said, affection and exasperation and something else. She did not say boy. She did not hug him, because that wasn\u2019t who she was, but she tilted her head in a way that made him feel pushed into the light anyhow. \u201cAbout time, Stud. Everybody knows you were going to. Even me. Which is difficult, because I barely know anything before half three.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s just a showcase,\u201d he said, because the part in him that was prepared for disappointment carried a sponge. \u201cNot like I\u2019m on the telly. Not yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cA small thing,\u201d she said. \u201cA big small thing. Does your mum know?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe knows. She told me I need a crown.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not wrong.\u201d Jessa flicked ash and watched it tumble. \u201cYou took your time, didn\u2019t you? Dancing. Like you had to ask permission from the weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I took my time because I was busy with other things,\u201d he said, and it was true, but not all of it. \u201cAlso, there\u2019s Dynamo, who might decide one day that I deserve to be a ghost.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and that ruddy horse,\u201d she said. \u201cOne day he\u2019s going to end up on the news and you\u2019ll be on the news by proximity. Move away from proximity, Stud. It\u2019s contagious.\u201d She stamped her boot, then tapped her cigarette out and tucked the stub neatly into a little silver case. She was always organized in the ways people didn\u2019t expect. \u201cI\u2019m coming to watch,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hate it,\u201d he said. \u201cToo many people. Too much\u2014everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can hate things and still attend them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my few talents.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to tell her about Maya\u2019s shoulder under his hand, the precise math of it. He wanted to tell her about how the room had watched and then the room had gone away. Instead he said, \u201cYou remember when we were in Year Nine and we did that thing at the community centre? The one where we had to pretend to be trees?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was the best tree,\u201d she said, bristling. \"I swayed. I threw shade.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were an award-winning tree,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew, then. I didn\u2019t know what to do with it. But I knew.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him the way she did when the cigarette case was out and she had no props. \u201cYou\u2019ve always known,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been pretending you didn\u2019t know because pretending is easier to do when you\u2019re tired.\u201d She touched two fingers to the air between them, not his hand but the idea of his hand. \u201cGo on then. Be the thing.\u201d\n\nAt home, Lyla burst through the door with her hood up and her cheeks reddened by the kind of cold that makes every laugh sound like glass. She threw her schoolbag at the sofa and missed. \u201cYou\u2019re famous,\u201d she announced, because anything that happened to one of them happened to both. \u201cEllison, you are trending, I\u2019m telling you. I posted your warehouse clip under a hashtag and two people I don\u2019t even know liked it.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are building brand,\u201d she said, dead serious. \u201cWe are building empire. We\u2019ll start with Milton. We can probably conquer Wolverton by Tuesday and after that\u2014Buckingham? Maybe not. They are stubborn. We can bribe them with\u2026 with something from Greggs.\u201d\n\nHe picked up her bag and put it on the sofa and she grabbed it in one motion and sat on it as if it were a living thing that might run. \u201cMaya,\u201d she said, with the relish of someone who enjoys proper nouns. \u201cShe\u2019s sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call people sick,\u201d Janine said from the kitchen. \u201cNot in my house.\u201d\n\n\u201cSick like good, Mum. Keep up. She\u2019s eight thousand followers good. She did that thing on top of the car that one time? Remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose car?\u201d Janine asked, as if it mattered for legal reasons.\n\n\u201cAnya\u2019s,\u201d Lyla said. \u201cNobody died. She\u2019s famous. You\u2019re going to dance with a famous person. Which will make you famous by osmosis, which is like chemistry but better hair.\u201d She bounced on the sofa bag-chair-throne. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. He looked at his mother, at the tea that had become the day\u2019s idol, and he admitted, \u201cYes. I am. I feel like my heart took up jogging without me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSave your jogging for the dance,\u201d Janine said. \u201cNo running in the house. It gets the rain in.\u201d She set plates down with the care she reserved for food, the thing that had to be made into enough. \u201cWhat time do you have to be where tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cNine at the stage,\u201d Nate said. \u201cTen with Maya. An hour with the choreographer after that. Then a break. Then camera blocking, which sounds\u2014violent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not violent,\u201d Lyla said. \u201cIt\u2019s sexy. Everybody says it. It\u2019s, like, sexy camera time. The camera is learning how to love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Janine said. \u201cSomebody should.\u201d She said it offhand, like a joke to keep the air appropriate for children. He felt the weight of it anyway, a plate placed gently and felt anyway. \u201cSleep,\u201d she added, pointing at him with a spoon like a general. \u201cDon\u2019t pace. You get the rug tired.\u201d\n\nHe tried to sleep early. He lay on his back and watched the slow machine of his ceiling fan turn his room into a calm geography. He had never been much for prayer, but he made a list of things he wanted and asked the ceiling fan as if it were something else. He wanted music he could survive. Partners who didn\u2019t give up on him. Knees that remembered their promises. A show that didn\u2019t insist he be someone else for the benefit of the screens. He wanted, more than anything, to get to the moment where he was on stage and the light found him when he wanted to be found.\n\nHe slept. It was the kind of sleep that felt like a very brief tunnel.\n\nThe second day in the rehearsal hall, Maya arrived on time and very nearly fell over a boom mic. \u201cSecond day,\u201d she said, breathless for no reason, then made jazz hands. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to rebrand as reliable. It\u2019s going to be short-lived but glorious.\u201d\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d he said, and they went back to work. The choreographer they\u2019d been assigned was a woman called Madi who wore black and smiled like a blade. \u201cI want joy,\u201d Madi told them, \u201cbut joy that knows pain. I want the edges of you. Where is the place you\u2019re not comfortable going? Go there all morning and then tell me when you get back.\u201d Maya bowed. Nate swallowed. They went there. They found a move that felt like a confession disguised as a lift. They fought over a count and then loved the way it landed. They learned each other\u2019s hands. They learned, too, the small resistances. Maya could not abide it when he pulled without warning; Nate could not abide it when they skipped a drill before he felt safe inside it. They got a little angry and then realized their anger was a cloud passing. They did not pretend clouds weren't clouds. They let the light be different for a while and then said something stupid, like the words for soup, and the cloud wandered off.\n\nAnya watched them and took notes with a pen that looked like it clicked, and didn\u2019t. \u201cMaya,\u201d she said, at one point, without looking up, \u201cyour left foot has turned into a liability. Don\u2019t encourage it.\u201d When Maya rolled her eyes, she added, \u201cHe\u2019s good for you. You should tell him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am right here,\u201d Nate said, and Anya looked at him full on for the first time that morning.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are. Don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d Then she put her eyes back on the pen that didn\u2019t click. Being seen and dismissed in the same breath was reassuring, somehow. It meant you had arrived in the place where work, not label, mattered.\n\nThey spilled sweat on the floor. They wiped it up. They drank too little water and argued about it. They laughed because their stupid lift looked like two teenagers trying to move a sofa through a door that hated them. Madi clapped the tiny sharp claps of approval that didn\u2019t pretend not to be proud. Around them, other pairs did their own versions of success and its ugly cousin. The room was a bowl full of yes trying to be said in six different languages.\n\nAfter lunch\u2014a sandwich that had ambitions above the bread it came on\u2014Madi handed them a sheet. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said, \u201cmedia day. Interviews. Photos. Wear whatever says you and your grandma. They like grandmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I say my grandma is dead?\u201d Maya asked.\n\n\u201cThey like that too,\u201d Madi said, not unkind. \u201cDon\u2019t get swallowed by stories. We dance first. We dance best. Then they can ask which is your good side and how you got here.\u201d She turned to Nate. \u201cHave you got your answer ready for how you got here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI came on the bus,\u201d he said, and Madi\u2019s blade-smile softened.\n\n\u201cKeep that one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut keep the real one too.\u201d\n\nHe thought about that on the bus home. How did you get anywhere? With tiredness? With love like a stubborn plant? With a friend who knew when to smoke outside your good news? With a mother who knew how to laugh through a hurt so it didn\u2019t think it won? He arrived not because of himself alone. The thought comforted and unnerved him; it made him consider the line between deserving and grateful and how light walked it like a wire.\n\nOn the third day, in the churn of rehearsal and the small domestic war between onstage and off, he went to the stables before dawn. He liked the way the world loved him there without screens. The horses\u2019 bodies made sense when nothing else did. He mucked out, he fed, he checked Dynamo\u2019s shoes and ran his hand over the horse\u2019s flank with the respect you owed to muscle that didn\u2019t know you were trying to love it. Dynamo snorted and tossed, then accepted him as a fact like cold. Nate leaned in and breathed in and tasted the day without polish.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t like the music,\u201d he told Dynamo, imagining the bright keys and the beat like someone knocking at the door in a hurry. \u201cBut you\u2019ll like the people. Or\u2014no, that\u2019s not true. You won\u2019t like any of it. But I do. And I\u2019m asking you nicely not to do anything. Okay? Please?\u201d\n\nDynamo flicked an ear and shunted his weight from one leg to the other, silent as a cathedral. Nate scratched the spot under his mane that made him stand like he\u2019d realized his own outline. \u201cI mean it,\u201d he said, because he always insisted on being understood by things that didn\u2019t speak his language. \u201cBehave.\u201d\n\nThe horse breathed, which was the only agreement Nate was going to get.\n\nWhen he left the yard, two kids were hanging on the gate, faces pink, noses running. \u201cAre you going to be on TV?\u201d one asked sharp as a knife.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Nate said, because yes was too naked a word. \u201cDepends on if I do as I\u2019m told.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you do that thing where you spin on your head?\u201d the other asked. His hat had cartoon ears that gave him a look of permanent misinformation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll break my neck,\u201d Nate said. \u201cI can do a thing where I spin on my hope and try not to fall over.\u201d They blinked at him. He winked. He left.\n\nHe carried with him the day and the people in it like pins in the inside of his jacket. He and Maya were good. They were getting better. Underneath, he felt a shape of fear he didn\u2019t give voice to. Shapes without names have a way of slipping through doors and making themselves at home.\n\nMedia day arrived with an aggression only people with clipboards can muster. Nate had never been so coaxed into sitting down. \u201cTell us about your journey,\u201d a woman with a microphone asked. She had hair that didn\u2019t move and a smile you could put your coffee on. He told her about the warehouse and the ladder and the way a man had once taught him a spin over a shouted lesson in an underheated gym. He told her about working at the stables and how his friend thought the word stud was funny. He did not tell her about the nights when he put his head against the cold window and asked the dark to be careful with him.\n\nThey took photos. Maya leaned into him like they did this every day. He tried to look like he belonged in photographs, a separate art. He felt the flash and the buzz and the metal scaffolding of attention being built around him. He said thank you too many times. He shook hands he would not remember later. He was careful, always, to find Janine in the crowd and tip his chin so she knew he was still himself underneath the bright.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Maya whispered when she saw his eyes flick to his mother, the way you look for a familiar building when you suspect the city moved. \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay. I can carry you. I\u2019m very strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d he said, and he did.\n\nWhen he finally had a minute to breathe, a man sidled up to him with the kind of shoes that made carpets nervous. \u201cNate,\u201d the man said\u2014his name carried on a tone that suggested he said a lot of names every day. \u201cI\u2019m Crispin. I represent sponsorship opportunities. I wanted to talk to you about\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLater,\u201d Nate said. He didn\u2019t like how his voice came out. He made it softer. \u201cSorry. Not now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Crispin said, storing the slight somewhere it could be used efficiently. \u201cWe\u2019ll make you look good. Trust me.\u201d He left a card on the table. The card felt heavy. He ignored it.\n\nIn the evening, he went to Tariq\u2019s, where the barbershop buzzed like a hive and the floor was a collage of hair colors. The chairs along the wall were full of boys who pretended to be bored and men who wished they could be. \u201cVIP!\u201d Tariq yelled, like anyone needed to be told. \u201cLadies and gentlemen: my day-one client since the dawn of time, the last man standing, the first man dancing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease cut my hair quietly,\u201d Nate said, sitting. The apron with its static clasp turned him into a person who could be sculpted. \u201cI\u2019m fragile.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a sculpture,\u201d Tariq said, and started the hum of the clippers. \u201cI saw you on the thing. I saw you look like you wanted to die and then look like you wanted to marry the camera. I have never seen anyone want to marry the camera. She is a difficult wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Nate asked, because he wanted to be kept in the world by ordinary questions.\n\n\u201cYou look like bread that has just been toasted,\u201d Tariq said. \u201cWarm. A little surprised at itself. We love to see it.\u201d He turned the chair and tilted the mirror. \u201cHey,\u201d he added, mirror and man aligned, voice lower, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you. Not everyone does the thing they say in the pub they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done it,\u201d Nate said. \u201cLike I\u2019m still on the bus and the bus hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuses don\u2019t stop if you look at them,\u201d Tariq said. \u201cLook out the window. They stop themselves. That\u2019s wisdom. I read it on the internet.\u201d\n\nNate paid and left the note he always left because haircuts were one of his luxuries and both he and Tariq pretended they weren\u2019t. He walked home through the part of Milton that looked like it had been drawn quickly and had never forgiven the hand that did it. He passed the off-licence that sold everything and nothing, the tire shop that had somehow become a rumor, the little street with the mural of a fox and a boy holding hands.\n\nHe slept again and the tunnel was a little shorter.\n\nThe next day, Dynamo bit his sleeve and tore it. He did not tear the skin beneath, which was a victory if you read it that way. \u201cMate,\u201d Nate said, \u201cwe had a talk.\u201d Dynamo stamped. The thuds were calm and angry. Nate held his ground and felt something inside him think about giving way and then decide not to. \u201cNot today,\u201d he said. The horse\u2019s breath fogged his wrist. They stared at each other, two animals with different rulebooks. Finally, Dynamo snorted and flicked his ear again like he\u2019d decided there were easier mountains to flatten. Nate let his shoulders go down and the air return to room temperature.\n\nOn his way out, he ran into Mr. Clancy, who had been around since fences were invented and had opinions about all of them. \u201cYou\u2019re the dancer,\u201d Mr. Clancy said, like he\u2019d discovered Nate by accident and was not sure he approved. \u201cDon\u2019t let the horse know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Nate said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let anybody know,\u201d Mr. Clancy added, and his laugh was a rasp of wood. \u201cExcept the whole city.\u201d\n\nNate laughed because it was easier. He waved and walked and felt like he was threading something through himself, some line that had been strung and waited. He met Maya at the hall. They refined. The lift stopped looking like a sofa and started looking like what it was, a way of telling someone you trust them without talking. Madi nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019ll do,\u201d in a voice that meant, That\u2019s starting to sparkle. Anya made a small sound that might have been a hidden applause. In the mirror, he saw himself and thought, You might be capable of this. He held the thought like a small animal.\n\nThey didn\u2019t talk about the final. It was a word they let sit in the corner. They didn\u2019t touch it in case it startled and ran. They talked about shoes. They talked about school and the radio stations that still played old songs like they were new. They talked about the weather in a way that meant other things. They talked about nothing and their bodies said everything.\n\nOnce, during a break, Maya said, \u201cMy dad wants to come to the show. He doesn\u2019t deal with crowds. He says he will deal. He says he can be softer than his fears.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood dad,\u201d Nate said.\n\n\u201cOccasionally,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy dad left when I was fifteen,\u201d he said, and the words dropped like a coin into a deep place. He didn\u2019t say them often. The story clanged. Maya looked at him and did not offer sympathy in the way people do when they like to hold their own hands up and show how empty they are. She just nodded, a tiny nod that acknowledged the existence of a scar like you acknowledge the existence of a mountain. There was relief in it\u2014no fuss. He wanted to thank her. He didn\u2019t.\n\nThey practiced until the evening came and reminded them there were dinners to eat and families to negotiate and small bathrooms to share with sisters. He went home and ate his mother\u2019s fish pie and told Lyla that emojis were something he would try but not something he trusted. He washed the plates because washing plates is a quiet that lives in the hands. He went to bed and the tunnel had lights. He slept and dreamed he was a horse in a suit, which meant nothing and meant everything.\n\nAnd every morning, the city put on its coat and went outside, and he put his body into the idea of dance, and the horses breathed fog to remind him the world still had weather, and he measured himself against both until he felt them the size he could hold. He tried to keep all the sharp good things from cutting him too soon. He counted the days without counting them, because counting made the number behave weirdly. He told himself he would remember to check the screws on the ladder if they ever gave him one again. He told himself to watch the edge of the stage where it did not care if you stepped off. He told himself don\u2019t be polite to fear. It does not repay the courtesy.\n\nOne late afternoon, the hall had been vacated except for him and the sound of his own shoes. He stayed to run the sequence once. Then once more because he had. The floor kept his secrets. He finished and saw his reflection in the high windows. He put his hand up and it did not quite reach the glass. \u201cOkay,\u201d he told it. \u201cWe begin.\u201d\n\nOutside, a horse somewhere in the fields tossed its head because the wind was wrong. In the stable, Dynamo listened to a far-off bass line and didn\u2019t like it, because Dynamo was not built to like what belonged to other animals. In the barbershop, Tariq told a story that grew and grew. In the kitchen, Janine added an extra potato to the pot without quite knowing why. In the house on the corner, Jessa put her cigarette away and, for once, didn\u2019t light another one. In a classroom, Maya pretended her attention belonged entirely to an equation. And in Nate\u2019s chest, something opened like hands.The stage at the Centre was wider when you stepped onto it than when you admired it from the seats, a geography that changed scale depending on your courage. Tape Xs marked where cameras wanted heads and shoulders to land as if humans were polite birds. The floor didn\u2019t give; it received, and the lights, even at half, had that hospital brightness that made you feel both examined and somehow clean. Nate followed a production assistant with a torch and a headset who said everything twice in a whisper, the only kind of whisper stage people respected. He stood where he was told and then moved six inches left because a man with a lanyard pointed a finger like a precise storm and said, \u201cLeft.\u201d Maya stood next to him and rocked on her heels, her mouth making shapes at the rigging like she was learning a new alphabet.\n\nCamera blocking was a misnamed ritual; nobody wanted to block anybody. They wanted flow that could be predicted. Madi walked them through the frame lines, her voice a metronome with opinions. \u201cThis lens loves your hips, Nate, not your knees, so don\u2019t hide in your knees. Maya, if you cut downstage there, the jib will love you and I want that for you because we need their love or they throw us off the internet. Pause here a half beat longer. Don\u2019t sigh; I can hear sighs at fifty metres. Smile at thirty, not at ten.\u201d They did it, then did it again, then did it with a pretend audience so Madi could measure their breathing. The floor had a seam that would catch someone not concentrating. Nate found it with the toe of his shoe, memorized it with the kind of care he usually reserved for people.\n\nThey left with the good tired that came from learning the rules of a room. By the time they got to the hallway the producer swarm had scented them, the way bees know when a boy has sugar in his pockets. Crispin had his shoes and his smile and the precise way he pitched his voice so it would travel without sounding like it travelled. \u201cThere he is,\u201d he said, as if the morning had been an elaborate game of hide and seek and he had just won. \u201cStud, my man. Wonderful. Wonderful shape the pair of you are making. Honest. Authentic. We love it. Quick one about a segment idea for the stream\u2014tiny little thing, won\u2019t take up your day. We want to put you with your horses. A little B-roll, a little content. You\u2019ll show us the stables, talk about discipline, about grounding, about how mucking out makes you the man you are. It cuts great with your, you know.\u201d He fluttered a hand in a shape that meant story.\n\nMaya had a look for fake niceness; it was almost respectful. She put it on now and let Crispin talk. Nate tried to answer with his skin, which had gone on alert. \u201cThey\u2019re not my horses,\u201d he said, because he wanted the sentence out in the air where it could protect them. \u201cThey belong to the yard. I work there. The boss is funny about cameras.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Crispin said, hearing all the words and none of the meaning. \u201cWe adore funny bosses. There\u2019s a universal quality to a funny boss. We can work it. We\u2019re not talking reality nonsense. We do this with taste. We do you justice. You\u2019ll sign a release. He\u2019ll sign a release. The public wants grit with its glitter. You\u2019ve got both. Come on, we\u2019ll make it painless.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there going to be big silver plates that flash light at things?\u201d Maya asked, tilting her head so the plaits made a question mark. \u201cBecause if you bring those to a horse, the horse brings a lawsuit to your face.\u201d\n\nCrispin did the laugh successful men do when they want you to think they\u2019ve got farm experience. \u201cWe know animals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very gentle. Tomorrow morning? Half an hour. Fifteen. Ten. You won\u2019t even know we were there.\u201d\n\nNate rubbed his palms on his jeans and found a word that had saved him more than once. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, and then, because no alone felt like a door he hadn\u2019t earned, he added, \u201cNot unless I ask my boss. And we\u2019d need quiet. And we\u2019ll keep to Lovey. Dynamo doesn\u2019t like\u2026 anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLovey,\u201d Crispin repeated, tasting a brand, and filed the name where captions are born. \u201cAsk the boss. Tell him national exposure. Tell him no cost. Tell him we\u2019ll pixelate his moles.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell him that,\u201d Maya said, grinning at the ceiling for dramatic effect. \u201cTell him we\u2019ll be fast and we won\u2019t point at the hay and say \u2018look, it\u2019s wheat.\u2019 He\u2019ll hate that.\u201d\n\nThey found a corner without voices and Madi leaned in, her blade-smile tucked away for the moment. \u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked, which sounded so small and sensible it was almost like being handed a clean glass of water.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them to make it a circus,\u201d Nate said. He was learning that some words, like circus, meant two opposite things at once. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet at the yard. People there don\u2019t like to be looked at with the lights on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we won\u2019t make it a circus,\u201d Madi said, and there was relief in the plainness of it. \u201cSay what you need out loud to the person who thinks they need the content. They\u2019ll still try for the content. That\u2019s their job. Our job is to do ours and put a hand up when it matters. Put your hand up.\u201d\n\nHe called Janine on the walk to the bus, told her the idea and the pit in his stomach, and listened to her slice onions carefully so she wouldn\u2019t cry for the wrong reasons. \u201cSay no,\u201d she said, after a pause where you could hear her decide, like a coin landing on a side. \u201cOr say yes if saying yes gets you something you actually want. If they want you to be a boy who lives in the mud because it fits in a nice box, let them stand in the mud for as long as you had to. I am not mopping under their shoes.\u201d\n\nAt the yard the next morning, the frost had given up being pretty and turned into something with a crunch. Mr. Clancy squinted at the van when it pulled in and squinted harder at the people who climbed out. The cameraman wore a beanie and expensive boots that wanted to be in a different postcode. The sound woman detached a little furry microphone from a case with reverence, as if it were a rescued animal. The runner was nineteen in a body that would always be nineteen. Crispin had dressed down in a jumper whose label said dressed up. \u201cHe looks like a cardigan advert,\u201d Jessa murmured out of the side of her mouth; she\u2019d come despite the hour, because if something went wrong she liked to be there to say told you so and help tidy it up anyway. \u201cIf he gets kicked I will remain neutral externally.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t get anyone kicked,\u201d Nate said to the air, and to Dynamo in particular. He presented Lovey like an old friend. She extended her long nose and breathed onto the microphone with interest, then sneezed wetly and endearingly. Maya arrived five minutes later, scarf to her nose, eyes bright with mischief that could be turned off like a switch. \u201cI have ten minutes,\u201d she said, \u201cthen physics, then regret. Where do you want my charm?\u201d\n\nThey set up by the fence, which had good angles and a background of honest field. Nate explained feed buckets and how you hang a hay net so a horse can eat but not get its feet in it, and he tried not to look like he knew the camera was close enough to count his pores. He let Lovey sniff his shoulder and made sure his hands were slow and visible. Maya, obediently at the edge of frame, laughed at something he said under his breath about the way the cows filed formal complaints about her scarf when she\u2019d come last, and her laugh made the cameraman pull focus in her direction instinctively like a man turning his head when he hears a song from childhood.\n\n\u201cCan we get you by the big lad?\u201d Crispin asked, restless for more drama. He didn\u2019t say Dynamo\u2019s name like a person would. He said it like a recipe required it.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nate said. He put the word on the fence where it could be seen, not tossed quietly into the grass to be stepped on later. \u201cWe\u2019re staying here. Lovey or the field or the yard dog if she decides to bless us. No Dynamo. He hates anything new and this is very new.\u201d\n\nCrispin did the palms-up thing that meant compromise but was actually persuasion with better manners. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep our distance. Just one pass. A touch of stroking. The public love a big horse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen show them a bus,\u201d Jessa said behind him, admirable in her commitment to heckling as an art form. \u201cIt\u2019s like a horse but you can wave at it without losing a finger.\u201d\n\nThe runner, whose nervous energy was a separate character on set, edged toward the second stall because youth makes you brave where experience makes you grateful. Nate saw the angle of it\u2014the open gate, the wrong body in the wrong sightline. Dynamo saw it too. He huffed and did that small freeze that came before the big movement, like lightning deciding what tree it wants. \u201cBack,\u201d Nate said, already moving, his voice low and the hand out, not to touch, but to make the space make sense again. \u201cBack. Hey. Back.\u201d The runner stopped at the tone, eyes wide, a deer who\u2019d wandered into a classroom. Dynamo lifted, not the full rear, but the combined vexation of a beast that had forgotten how to trust but remembered how to argue. The reflector, which had been idle like a quiet moon, flashed as someone shifted, and that was all it took to turn argument into action.\n\nNate stepped between. He didn\u2019t touch the horse yet; he bent his posture in that human bow that says I see you and I\u2019m going to make myself smaller, and he spoke the sounds he saved for this exact wrongness. His hands made a shape Maya recognised from rehearsals, the shape he made around a lift when he wanted to tell your weight it was safe. The runner backed up until her back met the wall and she realised walls could love you. Dynamo\u2019s foreleg stamped and found nothing to crush, and the noise of it cracked open the morning. Lovey in the next stall looked up, ears like pennants. Crispin did what men do who aren\u2019t sure what to do; he straightened his coat and then remembered not to reach for a shoulder. The cameraman lowered his camera in a gesture the universe should have rewarded.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Nate said again, and he laid his hand against Dynamo\u2019s neck when neck and hand agreed. He felt the tremor that ran like lightning seeking ground. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s all stupid. It\u2019s fine. My man. It\u2019s fine.\u201d He breathed how you want someone else to breathe. The ears flicked. The weight shifted back, and you could feel fifty angry kilos decide not to take revenge on anyone. He stood like a mountain being remembered by the people who named it. Nate let his shoulder drop and his eyes go soft and the flood that had entered his chest be turned back by the good gates you build with practice.\n\nMaya, who had not moved except to hold still like someone very much alive learning about stillness, made the face she made when a difficult sequence landed. \u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered, not for the horse, but for the cameras and the boy. \u201cOkay, okay. I take back everything bad I ever said about hay.\u201d\n\nCrispin\u2019s voice came out flatter than usual, the world having pried something slick off it. \u201cWe\u2019ll cut there,\u201d he said, and for once he meant it. \u201cWe have enough. Thank you. Thank you. We\u2019ll be out of your way.\u201d\n\nThe runner apologised six times. Mr. Clancy materialised to deliver judgement on the wind and everyone born in months with the letter R. \u201cHe told you,\u201d he said, not unkindly, to the crew. \u201cHe told you no. When a man says a thing and he knows it, it\u2019s best to stand a little behind the thing, not in front of it.\u201d\n\nAfter they left, the yard returned to its frequency. The dogs resumed their investigation of smells as if the world\u2019s secrets were not held in contracts but in nettles. Nate leaned on the fence and laughed like someone who had carried a weight for a mile and found it lighter at the end than it had been at the start. Maya climbed the gate and sat on the top rung, legs swinging, the picture of a girl who had learned the shape of bravery before someone drew it for her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to be scared later,\u201d she said eventually. \u201cYou used up your quota. That was terrifying. Don\u2019t do it again unless I have snacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will pre-schedule all terror,\u201d he said, wiping mud off his sleeve in a way that just redistributed it. \u201cYou going to be late to physics?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said, cheerful in defeat. \u201cI will tell sir I learned about forces anyway.\u201d She pointed at Dynamo, who was pretending he had never been dramatic a day in his life. \u201cNewton, but with opinions.\u201d She dropped down and wiped her hands on her trousers. \u201cCan I\u2014\u201d She stopped, fingers hovering. \u201cIf I\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cLovey will tolerate flattery from strangers,\u201d Nate said. \u201cDynamo will write to his MP.\u201d He led her to the skewbald, who let Maya\u2019s palm settle on the slope of her cheek like a carefully placed coin. Maya sneezed as predicted, looking betrayed and delighted at the same time. \u201cThis is my punishment for being a city child,\u201d she said, which made him laugh.\n\nAfter, she walked him to the bus, and they took the six benches between the gate and the road slow, like a ceremony. She told him she had a mock next week that would decide which part of the exam her teacher would sigh at. He told her his mother had a meeting with someone at the council about a letter without detail that had come in a brown envelope. They agreed that brown envelopes had done something to them both long ago that made the blood in your face walk out for a minute.\n\nAt home, the brown envelope had been tamed into a neat pile at the far edge of the table, like it had been told to think about what it had done. Janine was making something with onions, beans and an optimism that had never yet betrayed her. She didn\u2019t hover the way some mothers hovered when their boys came back from being watched. She did watch him without looking like she was watching, which is a different skill. \u201cHow was the horse,\u201d she asked, in the singular.\n\n\u201cPersuasive,\u201d he said, which made her mouth do the small uprights at the corners that said the day had not beaten her. \u201cThey won\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cThe house doesn\u2019t need to be on the telly to be real.\u201d She gestured at the pile with her chin. \u201cIt\u2019s just a thing about the rent going up. Everyone who owns anything wants to own more. It will be fine until it isn\u2019t. We\u2019ll think about it if it\u2019s not fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t pay a rise without thinking about it,\u201d he said, and she looked at him straight, which meant she had decided to tell one more truth than was strictly necessary.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBut your name isn\u2019t money yet. We\u2019ll take your name being yours before we make it work for anyone else.\u201d She went back to the pan. \u201cI\u2019ll ring Mrs. Khanna and ask about her nephew who knows about these things. He will say things about indexes and we will nod and then try not to cry when we have to do sums. Eat a biscuit before you talk to fear about money. It makes you brave.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to hand her Crispin\u2019s card and say, I could do a thing and they might put our faces next to trainers and pay me enough for three months of not worrying, but he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t know yet if that would be selling something that would cost more later than it bought now. Instead he said, \u201cI\u2019ll make the mugs,\u201d and he did, bringing her the chipped one with the bird on it that claimed it was indestructible.\n\nLyla arrived with three unsafe ideas and a glue gun. She had stolen poster board from school or repurposed a project so cleverly you could call it a theft if you wanted. \u201cWe are making signage,\u201d she said, like a general addressing a volunteer army. \u201cWe are making banners. We are making a plan for what I will wear when I am interviewed as your sister and I become my own entity. Mum, do we have glitter, and if we do not, why have you raised me in this denial.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have paprika,\u201d Janine said, handing her the jar with the seriousness paprika deserves. \u201cYou can pretend it is glitter and then burn your tongue. There is marmalade. That is sticky and festive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate marmalade,\u201d Lyla announced, so loudly that two houses down a man wondered briefly if he was missing a joke. \u201cAlso, I did my speech for English. It is about ambition. Spoiler: it is a trap and a ladder.\u201d She looked at Nate, her face doing the brand of cheek that came from having grown up in the same house as him. \u201cYou are mentioned three times. You owe me a footnote in your autobiography. I will accept payment in hoodies.\u201d\n\nThey worked at the table, domesticity making its case. He cut and she stuck and Janine rationed biscuits like she was handing out medals. The radio did that thing where it put on a song that made you remember a bus stop in Year Eleven and the smell of someone's perfume you thought at the time was proof that life had secret rooms. He let himself fall into the ordinary and could feel his body thank him for it.\n\nThe next day Maya was brittle in a way that took a minute to name. It wasn\u2019t anger. It was the kind of edge that shows up when you\u2019ve had to make your brain perform for strangers with clipboards. \u201cI did okay in the mock,\u201d she said, stretching like she could shake the graded paper out of her muscles. \u201cWhich feels like failing even when they tell you it\u2019s not. Dad said if I can do that I can do better, which is technically true and useless.\u201d\n\nAnya was quieter with her sharpness than usual, which told you she\u2019d chosen kindness as an experiment to see if it suited her. Madi came in with an energy that suggested she\u2019d wrestled a printer and won. \u201cWe edit,\u201d she said, dropping her bag and clapping once in a way that made people in three other rooms straighten their backs. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a little flourish in count five that reads polite. I don\u2019t love polite there. Bring me the thing under polite.\u201d They built the lift again from the floor up as if truth had to be set into muscle slowly. Nate\u2019s knee did a whisper, a little complaint like wood, and he told it to hold its counsel. Maya\u2019s left foot decided it didn\u2019t like the floor. Anya raised an eyebrow at the foot and the foot chose different priorities.\n\nThey argued once, properly, not the flirty kind of bicker that tastes sweet. It was about tempo, which is to say it was about control. Maya wanted to push, to ride the music like a wave you didn\u2019t respect. Nate wanted to place, to know where the board was before he stepped. \u201cYou\u2019re holding me,\u201d she said, breath fast, eyes bright. \u201cIf you hold me at your rhythm then I have to be you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I let it go faster I lose you,\u201d he said, feeling the old habit of repeating to make safety arrive. \u201cI can\u2019t catch you if I don\u2019t know where my feet are.\u201d\n\nThey practised it until both of them were wrong and then a little right. Madi stopped them when their annoyance began to bleed into their shapes. \u201cListen,\u201d she said, and they listened because she had that teacher voice that teaches even when it jokes. \u201cYou\u2019re both trying to keep the other safe in your favourite language. Switch languages. For eight counts you do it her way, Nate. Trust that your feet are not stupid. For eight counts you do it his way, Maya. Let the floor be a partner you aren\u2019t trying to seduce. Then you do it together. You\u2019re both right. Congratulations. It\u2019s boring to be both right.\u201d\n\nThey did what she said because boredom, in that room, was the worst insult available. It worked enough to give them a new argument later and a laugh now. Maya pinched the bridge of her nose like a pensioner and sighed. \u201cThis is gross,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I like it.\u201d\n\nOn the way out of the building, after a day that felt like three, Nate\u2019s phone vibrated itself anxious in his pocket. He looked and saw an unfamiliar number with a city code that made his mouth taste like coins. He could have ignored it. He could have let it fall into that place where calls go when you aren\u2019t ready. He pressed accept because he was tired of cupboard doors half open in his head.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said. There was a pause where a hundred versions of a man\u2019s voice arranged themselves and then chose one.\n\n\u201cNathan,\u201d the voice said, clipped, careful, as if the speaker had been sat on all day by life and had only now stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s your father. I saw you.\u201d There was a sound after saw that wasn\u2019t on the call, a sound like a chair scraping. \u201cOn the internet. Your\u2014dance.\u201d The word came out heavy with someone else\u2019s idea of it glued to it. \u201cYou were\u2026 very good.\u201d\n\nNate stopped in the doorway and felt the world decide how loudly it would continue. Maya had gone ahead, then realised he was a still shape and came back, standing a little distance away like a lighthouse that minded its own business. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, because there were a hundred words and he owned none of them. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I should ring,\u201d his father said. He was making a sentence in an unfamiliar language. \u201cTo say\u2014well done. And your mother\u2026 I might\u2026 I will send something. Money. If you need it. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d He cleared his throat, the international sign for a man not used to it. \u201cIt\u2019s good, Nathan. It suits you.\u201d\n\nThere were a thousand things to say that would make the air crack. He could pick none and still be honest. \u201cI have to go to rehearsal,\u201d he said, because he did not and could not explain that rehearsal was the place he had built for this exact moment. \u201cThanks for ringing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d his father said, just like that, the old word wrapping around the new call. \u201cAll right, son.\u201d He hung up clumsily, like people did on films when they had been told to hurry. The silence after him was not actually silent. It was a new sound. It took a second to learn whether it was a noise that meant danger, or weather.\n\nMaya nudged his elbow with hers in a way that only someone who\u2019s watched you find your way out of a different kind of hard thing is allowed to. \u201cOkay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, and a man walking past them with a sandwich laughed at something on his own phone, and the normality of it made the hall less bright. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine like okay or fine like I will be fine later but at the moment my skin is wearing me,\u201d she said, and he barked that laugh that comes when someone calls your shape what it is without drawing a circle around it.\n\nHe went home with a head full of sentences he had not said. He put his phone down on the table and looked at it like it was an animal he was training. Janine squeezed his shoulder as she passed him and set another potato going without discussion. That night, after all the people had put themselves in their rooms and declared their day done, he sat in the little patch of safety between sleep and worry and answered a message from Jessa on his own terms. She had sent a photo of the gate at the allotments and captioned it with a weather report that included opinions. He sent her a picture of the stage with no lights on and wrote, pocket city. She replied, pocket volcano, and that was exactly it.\n\nThe dress rehearsal brought the city into the room whether it wanted to be there or not. There were clipboards for the clipboards, runners with headsets who ran out of reasons to run, a man who only talked into a radio and never stopped mid-word. Security pinned badges to shirts as if they could pin time. They were asked not to spill water, not to spill secrets, not to spill themselves. The floor had been cleaned to the point of being an argument. The air had that quality of before. They ran the piece in costume, which meant Nate\u2019s good jacket and the trousers that had cost more than he\u2019d told anyone and Maya in a black set that managed the trick of being serious and impossible to ignore.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fall,\u201d Maya said, tying her laces the way only a person with younger knees can, with faith and speed. \u201cIt\u2019s bad television. Also bad everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will fall into being a responsible adult,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is worse.\u201d\n\nThey stepped into the light and let it find the sides of them it wanted to outline. The first notes were there, and Nate\u2019s hand found the space between Maya\u2019s shoulder and the air and held that space until it felt like warmth. The floor seam he\u2019d worried about was exactly where his body remembered it would be. He did the count her way and then his way and then their way. He did the lift with the breath and the trust and the minute flick of her eyes that said, yes now. He didn\u2019t look at the edge because he knew where it was. He didn\u2019t look at the cameras because the cameras, when you were doing it right, were just other animals in the field. Midway through the run he felt the small click Madi had wanted, the one that says the parts are talking to each other without requiring a meeting.\n\nThey finished on the last beat as if they had placed it there the day before and asked it politely to wait for them. There was no applause because this wasn\u2019t that kind of day. There was the noise of a room resettling into its function and a breath that belonged to both of them and a look from Madi that wasn\u2019t a blade and wasn\u2019t a shield, just a look that said this is a thing. Anya\u2019s bun had a hair out of it, which told you she had allowed human feeling to creep through all that efficiency just then and forgotten to fix it.\n\nBackstage, an assistant with a headset pointed them at a wall where names were listed with arrows. Nate saw his own and underneath it, in a hand that was not his, someone had written Stud in little neat letters and drawn a heart and crossed it out and then drawn a horse and left it. He laughed, and it was easier than before. He sat on a plastic chair while Maya was snatched for a lighting tweak and stretched his knees with the kind of care you give to bridges. He was an animal, and the stage was weather, and the city outside had put its coat on and would take it off when the lights were done.\n\nOn the way home he shared a carriage with a man in a fox costume who looked tired in the eyes and a woman holding three foil balloons that, despite her best efforts, had opinions about physics. Nate texted Lyla that her poster glitter had ended up on his trousers like a blessing from a god with poor aim. She sent him a picture of herself with two banners and a dog she had borrowed for the purpose of showing scale. He sent Tariq a video of the light rig doing its slow dance above an empty stage and typed, wife is in a good mood, and Tariq sent back, treat her right, she is high maintenance.\n\nHe got off two stops early again and walked by the river where the light was thinking about leaving. Two kids drew on the frost with their fingers and then looked guilty at the marks, as if they had cut the skin of something alive. The field smelled like cold and soil. At the fence near the far paddock he could just make out Dynamo, a big dark certainty. He lifted a hand and felt foolish and felt fine feeling foolish. \u201cWe begin,\u201d he said, not at the horse, not at the field, not at himself. He said it to the space that had grown in his chest since the email made him stop in the lane. He said it to the column of air between the stage and the kitchen. He said it to whatever in him had stayed quiet for so long to make room for other people\u2019s noises. He didn\u2019t get an answer, which felt right. He put his hands in his pockets and went home in the kind of silence that doesn\u2019t bite.The morning began with a smaller sky than usual, as if the weather had decided to be neat for once and fold itself before it left the house. Nate woke before the alarm, the kind of alert you get when your body has set its own clock out of stubbornness and a little love. He lay very still and checked inside himself for the noise that had been building all week. It was there, but it had rounded its edges and settled lower, closer to where his lungs did their work, as if it had decided to be useful. He put his feet on the cold floor and exhaled, counting without counting. From the kitchen came the sound of Janine finding bowls with the authority of a woman who had never once asked a cupboard\u2019s permission.\n\nHe found her at the table making poached eggs in the old metal saucepan that hated to cooperate. She had her hair tied back with a ribbon that had lost its right to be called ribbon but refused to retire. \u201cYou have a face on,\u201d she said, not looking up because mothers can see you with the wrong part of their heads. \u201cIs it the face for the big day or the face for pretending it\u2019s just Thursday?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a face that would like eggs,\u201d he said, and sat, and let his hands sit obediently on the wood because it grounded him to have them do as they were told. Lyla came in like weather, an event in a hooded top that had declared war on quiet. She was already wearing her banner like a sash and had glitter in her eyelashes that made her blink like a lighthouse.\n\n\u201cAre you going to be sick?\u201d she asked with the cheerfulness of the truly supportive. \u201cIf you are going to be sick, do it in the sink because the bathroom is a crime scene.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not going to be sick,\u201d he said, and discovered he meant it. \u201cIf I am going to be sick, I will do it on Crispin\u2019s shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do not do it on anyone\u2019s shoes,\u201d Janine said, and plated an egg with the ceremony of a due acknowledgement. \u201cEat. Then breathe. Then call Jessa and remind her that she cannot yell at security. Then go and be brilliant. We will follow like sensible shadows.\u201d\n\nThe bus today held himself and four teenagers who looked at the world in the way people look at a buffet when they\u2019re not sure whether it\u2019s polite to be hungry. Milton did its Milton thing outside the window, pragmatic and hopeful in the same breath. He could see the Centre from far off, the big curve of glass and the thin letters on poles that had been designed by someone who believed in fonts. The city had put on clean clothes; he could tell from the way people were walking faster.\n\nAt the stables, the frost had turned to slick silver in the places the sun hadn\u2019t reached. He took the long path around to give his brain something ordinary to do and found Mr. Clancy checking a gate like the gate had offended his family. \u201cBig day,\u201d Mr. Clancy said, and that was generous for him. \u201cDon\u2019t fall off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep my feet,\u201d Nate said, and ran a hand down Lovey\u2019s neck because she let him share nerves with her without taking any for herself. Dynamo snorted from his stall like he was making fun of anyone who would leave their house to be watched. Nate leaned on the half-door and looked in anyway, respecting the line between courage and foolishness. \u201cI won\u2019t bring any cameras,\u201d he said, which felt like a promise and sounded like diplomacy. Dynamo flicked an ear toward him and returned to pretending hay was a grievance.\n\nMaya texted from the top deck of her own bus a picture of her trainers and a caption that said, these shoes refuse mediocrity. He replied with a picture of his knee wrapped in the kind of elastic that suggested it had opinions about everything and wrote, this knee will be polite. She wrote back a string of small gold trophies and a bowl of soup for reasons neither of them could remember.\n\nThe stage at the Centre had grown a kiss of light overnight and looked like somewhere important and unforgiving. The crew had multiplied, and you could tell who belonged to which department by the way they moved. Sound people always looked like they were listening to something no one else could hear. Lighting people gazed upward as if God had left notes in the rigging. Production assistants went everywhere at once and somehow also nowhere in particular. Anya stood just inside the wings like a chaperone who had promised to let the children make their own mistakes unless those mistakes involved tripping in front of strangers. Madi was on the edge of the stage with her clipboard and her soft blade-smile and a thermos that probably contained something decent.\n\n\u201cMorning, joy merchants,\u201d Madi said when they came into her radius. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the cue-to-cue again because everyone is pretending yesterday didn\u2019t happen and then we\u2019ll leave you alone to be good at your jobs. Nate, the jib will make a pass that feels like a new moon. Don\u2019t look at it like it owes you money. Maya, your hair is doing a thing the camera hates, so either make it do a different thing or we won\u2019t look at your head, which would be a waste.\u201d\n\nMaya extracted a bobble and reworked her plaits with the efficiency of a girl who had been explaining herself to mirrors since she could reach them. \u201cI had a dream I was late,\u201d she said to nobody in particular. \u201cIn the dream I was late and no one minded because we were all underwater. Then I woke up and remembered about punctuality and oxygen, and I couldn\u2019t go back to sleep because both seemed suddenly tyrannical.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be on time and you\u2019ll breathe,\u201d Anya said from her post, and lifted a hand an inch, a blessing and a threat. \u201cYour left foot is already trying to rebel. Tell it to sit down.\u201d Maya wiggled her left toes and then stamped because obedience sometimes needed theatre.\n\nThey ran the beginning and the middle and the end and then they ran the bits in between. The lights did that slow roll that made the stage feel like a breathing thing. Nate learned the camera\u2019s path in the way you learn a dog\u2019s intentions, by watching the places it looked at when it thought no one was paying attention. He could feel his body find familiar routes. The seam was where he had left it. The breath was where Madi had requested it. The lift came and went without complaint, not like a secret, but like a sentence that knows its own grammar.\n\nIn the green room that had been christened green because no one had the heart to call it fluorescent, someone had laid out fruit and pastries and a humiliation of tiny bottles of water that tried too hard. Performers did their rituals: some talked, some slept, some stretched one hamstring on the back of a chair in a way that made health and safety inspectors dream of retirement. A boy with the silver hoodie from the first day had a portable speaker and a face that said he was negotiating the playlist with God. He nodded at Nate like conspirators. A woman with the red dress had pinned nothing to the corkboard and looked content about it. Maya ate a banana and then a second banana and then announced that two bananas were the exact right amount and any banana beyond the second banana was hubris.\n\nCrispin did a loop of the room that felt like a security check for emotions and paused by their corner with the very particular delight of a man who could smell a moment he could sell if he pressed at the edges. \u201cBig night,\u201d he said, his voice pitched to perform intimacy in a publicly acceptable register. \u201cVery proud of the piece. Very us. A little note about post-show opportunities. It will be mad; we\u2019ll want content in the corridor, maybe at the fountain if we can steal a minute, a little raw thing for the stream. Give me two shots of your faces right after you come off. I promise not to ask for tears. If tears happen naturally, we don\u2019t argue with nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dancing,\u201d Maya said, and her smile was weaponised. \u201cEverything else is a queue. You can take our faces after we\u2019re finished using them.\u201d Crispin applauded the line like he intended to put it on a T-shirt. When he moved on, Madi drifted in like a very polite storm and stood between them and whatever was next because that was part of her job too.\n\nJanine texted a picture from the plaza where sunlight made a brief and necessary attempt to improve the concrete. She had Tariq and Jessa on either side of her like a pair of mismatched bodyguards and Lyla in front with a banner so large it had required three buses to explain it. The sign read GO ON THEN, STUD in letters so confident they were almost arrogant, and beneath that LYLA\u2019S BROTHER, CALL ME IF YOU ARE A TALENT SCOUT, with a number that probably belonged to a pizza place. Nate laughed the sort of laugh that comes when love gets the spelling wrong and still arrives on time. He texted back a heart and then a horse and then corrected the horse because the first horse looked like it might sue.\n\nThe house filled itself with the steady discipline of people who had paid for their tickets and wanted them to work. You could hear the audience in the walls, the sound that isn\u2019t sound exactly but a pressure, a waiting. Backstage, the queue reshuffled as cues always do and they were pushed ten minutes and then pulled five, the elastic time of theatre. A runner with a headset and the kind of concentration usually reserved for bomb disposal knocked on their door with the knuckles of someone trying not to disturb ghosts. \u201cFive to you,\u201d she said, and smiled so quickly it almost didn\u2019t count, and they stood.\n\nIn the wings, the stage looked more like a river than it had before, a strip of brightness you could step into if you agreed to get wet. Nate could smell hairspray, dust, and the cheap apple scented cleaner they used on the railings. He could feel Maya\u2019s shoulder close to his arm, the familiar geometry that had been earned in a week and felt like something older. Anya, who had sworn she did not believe in touching before performances, put one hand on each of their backs like a bridge and leaned her forehead for half a breath against the cool metal of the fly system. Madi counted them off without moving her mouth. The opening bars slipped in under the curtain like a late guest.\n\nThey went. There was the bright of it and the blank of it and the calm inside the bright that felt like snow, the good kind that teaches the world to hush. They did the small things first because small things make big things possible. He placed his weight and then took it back and then let it go and did not ask permission again. She sliced and he caught; he rolled and she pressed; she made gravity jealous and he forgave it. On three-and-four he felt her elbow say now in a language the bones speak. On five he gave up the bit of control he had been hoarding for emergencies. On seven he found it again but it had changed shape and he liked the new one better. The air on the stage has temperature and he could feel it adjust to them, get warmer where they wrote their names into it.\n\nThere were notes, the ones that had been notes for days and the ones that arrived and left like birds, and for once he didn\u2019t resent them. The seam on the floor tried to argue and he declined the argument. The phrase they had fought about did what phrases do when they are finally trusted: it held. The lift came and for a blink the world giggled in panic because she was not quite where the rehearsal had promised she would be and he was not quite where his knee intended, but then her hand met his wrist and his palm found the top of her shoulder and they changed the count by a hair and the new count was a doorway they could pass through without lying. It was the kind of error that makes the rest true. He felt Anya\u2019s distant approving frown and Madi\u2019s soft exhale without having to see them.\n\nThe last eight counts were the ones they had told nobody about in case they went wrong. They had stolen a tiny piece of quiet and dropped it into the choreography like a coin into a well. The music peeled back and they were left with the sound of shoe on floor and the breath that belongs to two people when two people are doing a thing exactly together on purpose. The air held its shoulders high. He put his hand out and she stepped into it and their heads turned at the same time to two different points in the room and you could feel the audience\u2019s collective neck move with them like obedient birds. Then the last beat, which is never the last beat, and blackout that wasn\u2019t full because the emergency lights were doing their duty, and the small noise a big room makes when it has decided it is safe to tell the truth.\n\nThe applause wasn\u2019t thunder. It was rain on a roof, grateful and accumulating, the kind that arrives from a lot of people deciding yes at once. He received it like he\u2019d been told to hold a baby for the first time. He could hear Lyla in the top corner where the banner had been a menace and Janine\u2019s particular clap which carried straight back to his years and Tariq\u2019s whistle that started with a vowel you couldn\u2019t write down. He would have sworn he heard Mr. Clancy, but he knew that was impossible; some sounds just carry themselves back to you when you need them.\n\nBackstage was a well-lit chaos with hugs and the sort of congratulations that contain the words for your name even when they don\u2019t use them. Madi squeezed his shoulder and the blade-smile retired for a minute. \u201cYou didn\u2019t apologise to the floor,\u201d she said, which in her language was a medal. \u201cThat was adult of you. Keep it up.\u201d\n\nAnya looked like a person who had taken off a small piece of armour without ceremony and then decided she did not want it back immediately. \u201cYour left foot,\u201d she said to Maya, because she had a reputation to maintain, and then added, \u201cHe is good for you.\u201d She looked at Nate for one second longer than the rules permitted and nodded. \u201cYou may tell your mother I said that and that she is allowed to be smug.\u201d\n\nCrispin appeared like a spare note and for once asked for nothing more than the faces he had promised himself. He got a quick frame of them both with the red of effort in their cheeks and put the camera away like a man respectful at a funeral. \u201cThat was delicious,\u201d he said, holding his hands an inch apart like he was describing a small cake. \u201cI can sell this all day, but I won\u2019t until you\u2019ve eaten something that isn\u2019t a banana.\u201d\n\nThey ate whatever the green room offered that wasn\u2019t dignified, the good indignity of food with the soul of a petrol station. Other dancers came by to hit them lightly on the arms in the way you do when you know someone will bruise the next day and you want to be a part of it. The boy in the silver hoodie taught Lyla a three-count move in the corridor while security looked the other way because sometimes kindness was part of the job. A producer with a spreadsheet the size of Milton told Maya she had done the city proud. Maya said the city had done itself proud and then had to sit because pride is heavy if you don\u2019t distribute it evenly.\n\nThey were finally released into the foyer where the public had been invited to behave like they\u2019d just seen someone do a thing worth talking about. Janine barrelled toward him with that particular combination of dignity and haste mothers possess when they are proud and don\u2019t want to embarrass themselves doing it. She started to say your and then switched to you and then found nothing and did the practical thing of putting both her hands on his cheeks and expanding her smile into a room with which she had not negotiated at all. \u201cYou were beautiful,\u201d she said, and the word landed like a truth you can stand on. \u201cYou were yourself.\u201d\n\nLyla flung herself around his waist and said his name fifteen times because her mouth needed practice at belonging to the moment. Tariq, who had already told seven people in the foyer a version of the story in which he had discovered Nate in a skip and polished him until he shone, hugged him and whispered in his ear, \u201cShe said yes,\u201d as if the city itself had proposed. Jessa stood at the edge of the group, her hands in her pockets, her cigarette deliberately absent. She raised her chin and he saw her eyes do the soft thing they only did when she\u2019d forgotten to be difficult. \u201cAcceptable,\u201d she said, which meant she had moved her own furniture around to make room for pride.\n\nHe was turning toward Maya to say the thing that would help them pin this to the day when a voice he knew at the edges and not quite in the middle said his name like a word it had decided to pronounce properly. He looked and there was his father, not quite in the light, carrying his hands the way men carry tools when they don\u2019t want to admit they missed them. He had shaved with poor confidence. He wore a jacket that was doing its best. He had a stiff bouquet that had been bought from a supermarket that had arranged flowers under a fluorescent ambition. Behind him, as if the city were helping with stagecraft, the automatic doors opened and sent a gust of warm air and perfume into the space between them.\n\n\u201cNathan,\u201d his father said again, softer, because the first had been a rehearsal. \u201cThat was\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen you do\u2026 that.\u201d He gestured toward the stage with the bouquet and one of the lilies, unsure of its own strength, abandoned the group and fell to the floor with the sort of tragic grace only flowers can manage. No one reached for it. It seemed right to let it rest.\n\nJanine\u2019s face went neutral in that very particular way of women who have promised themselves a certain standard of self-respect in public. She stood a fraction to the side, not shielding, not offering, simply holding the air equal between two people and waiting to see if the gravity changed. Lyla\u2019s eyes went large and clever and she stepped backwards into Tariq, who put a hand on the top of her head without thinking about it and then pretended he had been planning that gesture for weeks.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming,\u201d Nate said, and he heard his own voice and approved of its plainness. He was surprised to find that none of the old weather came scudding over the horizon at the sight of the man; the stage had rearranged his climate. \u201cWe don\u2019t\u2026 we don\u2019t have a lot of spare chairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stood,\u201d his father said, and the humour he tried on did not rest naturally on him but did not embarrass either of them. \u201cI rang and then I thought, it\u2019s no good ringing and not doing. So I did. I got\u2026 lost.\u201d He grimaced at the word like an admission. He looked at Janine very briefly, and when their eyes met they both nodded like people who have negotiated peace in a war neither wants to revisit. \u201cYou were very good,\u201d he added, turning back. \u201cI brought\u2026 these.\u201d He held the bouquet out like a licence he hoped would be accepted. The cellophane crinkled with the sound of a thousand small apologies. Janine took the flowers without commentary and handed them to Lyla, who took them in the sullen exalted way teenagers take responsibility when they sense danger and also an opportunity to be superior.\n\n\u201cThis is Maya,\u201d Nate said, because he could not think of anything else to say and introducing someone brilliant felt like a good old custom to rely on. \u201cMy partner. Maya, this is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father,\u201d she finished, stepping in, her hand quick and neat. \u201cHi. The dance was a two-person project. He was not entirely responsible.\u201d She grinned just enough to make the words warm. \u201cI\u2019m very strong.\u201d\n\nHis father shook her hand and looked as if he were calibrating a new machine. \u201cYou\u2019re very good,\u201d he said, and the accuracy of it was a gift to all of them. \u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2026 do that. My knees.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy knees are teenagers,\u201d she said gravely. \u201cThey do what they want.\u201d\n\nThey stood in a small, complicated space and the city continued to move around them like a polite animal. It was easier than it could have been. Jessa put her cigarette back in its case so that no one had the excuse of a smoke to leave. Tariq declared himself in need of a drink with the timing of a saint and then did not have one. Anya appeared by a column wearing the expression of someone who has found herself in the row with her least favourite ex-student and discovered he has improved; she took Janine\u2019s elbow for a second, not so much to guide as to share practical weight.\n\nThere was still a stage and still lights cooling and still a choreography of interviews and the polite violence of cameras that needed faces. Crispin made consider-it eyes from a respectful distance like a nature documentary narrator acknowledging a mother with cubs. Madi mouthed wrap in his general direction and he had the sense to accept being told. Somewhere the man in the fox costume was half out of his head and regretting every choice he\u2019d ever made that had led to him profiting from children\u2019s birthdays. Somewhere the woman with the balloons had finally explained physics to her son by letting one go.\n\nThey made their way towards the doors in a small herd, letting the happy strangers press them from the sides and not minding the fingerprints. Outside, the afternoon was doing a good impression of an evening and the plaza had the sort of wind that didn\u2019t bother announcing itself. People stepped out into it with coats that had been designed for better towns. Tariq positioned himself so that anyone taking a photo might accidentally get his good side. Jessa held the bouquet under her arm like a medieval weapon. Janine kept very upright and walked at a pace that said she would choose what would happen next even in a crowd. Nate felt lighter in the legs than he usually did after dancing and decided this was what happens when terror burns cleanly instead of sooty.\n\nAcross the square, a boy of about eight practised mimicking one of Nate\u2019s steps for a friend with the exact seriousness of the self-taught, legs doing their best impression of precision. His friend clapped at the wrong place and corrected himself, and the two of them folded away into their mothers, who were already planning to tell their sisters about the night. A kid on a BMX ghosted through traffic he was not supposed to be in and shouted Stud in a tone that managed to be affectionate and insulting, which is to say it was perfect. From the edge of things, Mr. Clancy appeared like a rare weather condition and nodded at Nate once from under his flat cap and then left because he did not believe in prolonged public gestures. It was as near to a blessing as he would ever attempt.\n\nThey ended up at a cafe with a glass front and an army of chairs that all made the same noise when you moved them. Apparently every good thing today would come with lighting that flattened your skin. They took two tables and pushed them into one without asking permission. The waitress, who had done ten of these nights and had collected them like stamps, brought chips, tea, and a piece of cake so dense it had a gravitational field. Maya took off her shoes under the table and sighed and then did not apologise for it. She fed Lyla chips like she was domesticating a dragon. Janine unfolded a napkin on her lap and immediately forgot it existed. Jessa tried to reach for her packet and then remembered the cafe had rules and settled for twisting her ring and looking at the ceiling like it had wronged her personally. Tariq told a version of the lift that made the laws of physics wave politely and step aside.\n\nHis father sat at the end, just outside the noise, hands on his knees the way people used to do at funerals and weddings, and watched without staring. He had a way of smiling now that made his eyes smaller and kinder; Nate did not recognise it and decided he would not be cruel about the delay. After a while, his father cleared his throat again, and it had less to clear this time. \u201cDo you need,\u201d he began, and stopped, and the napkins in the universe held their breath. \u201cDo you need anything?\u201d He looked at Janine when he said the last word, as if he had resat a default setting he had not used in nine years.\n\n\u201cWe need him to sleep,\u201d Janine said, after a second in which you could have balanced a plate. \u201cWe need a stable rent for six months and for the bus not to change its timetable without telling him because he will be late and say it is his fault. We need a new hinge for the cupboard under the sink and no more brown envelopes without warning.\u201d She took a drink of her tea as if to underline the points. \u201cOther than that,\u201d she concluded, \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do the hinge,\u201d he said, relief and sadness sharing a chair. \u201cI can do the bus timetable if I write a letter. I can do two months of the rent and then ask if that helps. I can\u2019t promise anything past that because I\u2026 because I won\u2019t. Not anymore.\u201d He placed a folded envelope on the table that was thick enough to be awkward and thin enough to be sincere, and then pushed it towards the centre like an offering to a god. \u201cYou can hate me and still\u2014let me do that. I won\u2019t stand in the kitchen for it. I won\u2019t ask what you buy. I\u2019ll just\u2014do that.\u201d\n\nJanine looked him in the face with her proper look and did her accounting inside her head where no one could disturb it. She did not touch the envelope because she respected its power to set rooms on fire. \u201cYou can,\u201d she said, and the cafe did not even notice the kind of moment it was hosting. \u201cWe can. We will not thank you for old fires. We will thank you for hinges and two months.\u201d She offered him a corner of a smile that contained all the mathematics of adult life. \u201cYou can come to the next if you can be silent in the way that counts and loud in the way that doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can be both,\u201d he said, and for once you believed him.\n\nIt was not tidy. There was not a violin in the corner that started up because they had arrived at resolution. There were chips and crumbs and the squeak of chairs and the fact of the city outside doing the brave, boring work of being itself. There would be phone calls later to answer and messages to ignore and one from Crispin that would be easy to swat away because the night had taught Nate where his no lived. There would be a knee that muttered again because bodies cannot be argued with for free. There would be a text from Maya at 2 a.m. that said I have never been this tired and also alive, please advise, and he would send her a horse emoji because he did not have horse tranquillity to prescribe in pill form. There would be the ordinary mercy of sleep.\n\nWhen they walked back to the bus stops, Janine took his hand the way you take a parcel that you know contains fragile and necessary things. Lyla carried the lilies blunt-side-up as if she had been born for that sort of choreography. Tariq told the night porter for the Centre that he was the lead barber on the production and the man pretended to be impressed in the way men do when they recognise someone else\u2019s need to be taller. Jessa fell behind on purpose to blow smoke at the idea of fate and then caught up because she could not resist a good exit line. His father peeled off at the corner and lifted his palm without committing to a wave and looked back only once, which meant he had done something heroic according to the alarming rulebook of fathers who try again.\n\nOn the top deck of the bus, the city was softer, as if someone had turned the fabric over and revealed the weave. Nate put his forehead to the glass and let its chill whittle down the edges of his mind. The lights of the shops made a little theatre out of nothing. In the reflection he could still see the stage-version of himself hovering a fraction to the left of the real, the way a double exposure makes you look briefly haunted. He felt the weight of the envelope in his mother\u2019s bag like a tiny planet and decided he would not let it tilt their orbit without their consent. He thought about the lift and the mistake that had made the count truer and smiled into his arm because the best parts of anything were always a little misaligned.\n\nAt the house, they took their shoes off at the door because even on big nights you obey the carpet. Janine put the lilies in the good vase as if she had never once called it the silly vase, and the water took the stems like an oath. Lyla stuck the banner to the wall above the television with tape that would test the paint\u2019s character in the morning. Nate stood in the kitchen and let the kettle talk to him about steam and time. When he went into his room he waited for his heart to remind him to be careful and it did not; it reminded him to be brave instead. He lay back and listened to the small noises of the house negotiating with the night. Somewhere a fox screamed, which is to say it stately announced itself to all animals everywhere, and he laughed because a fox screaming at the sky after a good thing had happened was exactly the sort of nonsense the world liked to chip in.\n\nSleep came, not as a tunnel, but as a lake he could step into without checking its depth first. He went under with his eyes open and found that it was clearer than he remembered. In the morning, the weather would begin again as if it had invented the idea of consistency. He would go to the yard to be reminded where his hands ended and the animal began. He would read messages from people he hadn\u2019t spoken to since school who would tell him they always knew he would, and he would believe some of them and put the rest in a drawer. He would answer Crispin properly and kindly and keep his words. He would stretch and ice and be humble and not small. He would be asked to do that piece again somewhere brighter and he would decide if brighter served the piece. He would be what he had decided to be yesterday when he stepped into the light and let it make its measurements. He would keep saying no to the things that wanted the mud but not the work and yes to the things that smelt of hay and counted in fours.\n\nAnd for a while, in the kind of silence that chooses you and not the other way around, the world met him halfway.The morning after the show, the house held its breath like it was trying not to rustle the good luck. Nate\u2019s phone woke up before he did and jittered itself along the bedside like it wanted to roll away and start a second life under the chest of drawers. He lay very still with his eyes closed and counted to twelve because twelve had been good to him lately, and then he let the world in. Messages layered themselves like pastry. Tariq had sent a video of himself shaving a man who insisted on calling a fade a \u201cgentle cliff,\u201d overlaid with the caption I did the hair so you did the air. Jessa had sent a photo of an unlit cigarette on a saucer\u2014it looked like a museum piece\u2014with the title restraint, for you. Maya had sent three words, we didn\u2019t drown, and four trophy emojis and then, contradicting herself two minutes later, a voice note in which her breath was still visible between the words. \u201cMy dad cried once and then pretended to find something in his eye for the entire second half,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you tell him I told you, I will say you\u2019re a liar who lies and also owes me soup.\u201d There were unknown numbers with greetings that came in corporate fonts, a smattering of hearts from people he could place by the kind of punctuation they used, and a crisp who is this from an old classmate that felt like a pebble thrown into his childhood window.\n\nAt the yard, the cold had been trimmed to a respectable shape. The water in the troughs wore a delicate lid that broke with the sound of small manners being discarded. Mr. Clancy was already there in a coat that had seen several winters and chosen not to comment. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, as Nate ducked under the stable door into the smell that meant honest work, and the word well hung there with enough to be going on with. \u201cDon\u2019t be bringing the BBC in here again.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an answer, which was his talent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not bringing anybody in,\u201d Nate said. He moved slow among the bodies he could read like a grammar book he\u2019d learned as a child. \u201cI\u2019ve been informed I\u2019m not allowed to adopt the stallion, film the stallion, or introduce the stallion to experimental lighting.\u201d He ran the broom under the gate like he was combing a giant\u2019s fringe. Dynamo watched him with the unimpressed expression of an elder deity whose worshippers have discovered Instagram.\n\nThe boss\u2014Mrs. Pritchard, a woman made of tweed and spine whose mouth could say tea and thunder with the same economy\u2014appeared in the aisle with a set of rubber gloves like a sermon. \u201cYou had a circus,\u201d she announced. She didn\u2019t need to employ a rising intonation; she wasn\u2019t asking for context. \u201cOn my yard. With reflectors. Reflectors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said no,\u201d Nate said, and he put the broom against the wall because he\u2019d learned you couldn\u2019t hold your ground properly while holding anything else. \u201cHe\u2014Crispin\u2014moved a runner near Dynamo. I moved the runner back. Dynamo did what Dynamo does. Nobody got kicked. I\u2019m sorry it happened. It won\u2019t again. Not without your say-so. Not at all, if you want. I told them Lovey and the fence and they wanted the big lad. I said no then, and I\u2019m saying no now again, in case the walls missed it.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pritchard\u2019s eyes did a slow movement from Nate to the horses and back that had weighed out many men and not found them worth a handful of bran. \u201cDon\u2019t give me media,\u201d she said, as if the word itself had broken a promise to her once. \u201cGive me the sweepings and the feed and the schoolkids who think poo is a joke and then realise it\u2019s a job. You\u2019ve got a thing on the side now. That\u2019s your business. Don\u2019t make it mine.\u201d She paused, assessing whether she needed to say more, and decided to throw him a penny. \u201cYou did right with him. He\u2019ll never love you. That\u2019s not what some animals are for. He\u2019ll respect you if you keep not dying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made that my brand,\u201d Nate said, and she gave him the ghost of a grin, which meant they would behave as usual and complain about anything new.\n\nBack home, the kitchen had donned its after-party face\u2014glasses that didn\u2019t belong to their cupboard, a ribbon pretending not to be attached to anything, the faint smell of cake like a rumour. Janine had tied her hair up with a pen because the ribbons had declared industrial action. The brown envelope was now white and had the council logo in the corner, and it sat on the table with a novelty mug on top of it like a flimsy paperweight guarding its own cousin. \u201cYour father\u2019s coming in twenty,\u201d she said without preamble, and someone who didn\u2019t know her would have missed the drama entirely. \u201cWith a hinge.\u201d\n\n\u201cA hinge,\u201d Nate repeated. There was a kind of relief in the word. Hinges were things that attached one solid object to another and allowed movement; they had laws. He could handle a hinge.\n\nLyla came down the stairs holding a bouquet that had been deconstructed by a sixteen-year-old monster who wanted to see how things worked; the lilies had been demoted to jam jars, the ferns had been conscripted into the potted basil and looked excited by the promotion. \u201cI\u2019m making a shrine,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s modern. It has mixed media. It will be studied by future generations in my art book. Also, there\u2019s a man called Crispin calling me from a number with more numbers than seems legal. He wanted a quote. I gave him a quote. He did not enjoy my quote.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Janine asked, only mildly afraid.\n\n\u201cI told him if he wants an angle he can go stand on the stairs,\u201d Lyla said. \u201cHe hung up, which was rude. If he rings back I\u2019m charging per syllable.\u201d\n\nPaul Ellison arrived at eleven with the structure of someone who has practised not arriving and was learning it again. He held a toolbox that had belonged to his father and the metal handle had that shine tools get when hands have told them secrets for decades. He had, to everyone\u2019s relief and vague disappointment, bought no more flowers. He did bring a packet of custard creams and a loaf of sliced bread in a bag from a shop that always smelt of floor cleaner and sugar. \u201cYou said hinge,\u201d he said, and let his eyes land on the cupboard beneath the sink like a man meeting a rival he\u2019d heard a lot about. \u201cI can do hinge.\u201d\n\nJanine stood back like she would for anyone with a drill. \u201cIt\u2019s on a slant,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything in this house is on a slant. It\u2019s an attitude problem. Do what you can. If it goes wrong, the cupboard has been threatening to become a hole for years, so we may as well get the panic over with.\u201d She looked at his hands, which moved like they remembered usefulness despite the intermission. He did the hinge in five minutes longer than a hero would have and ten minutes quicker than a fool. He swore once under his breath in the polite way of men who respect women in houses\u2014no theatricals, no apologies, a little rhythm to help the screw recognise the hole.\n\nLyla watched from the doorway with her arms folded and her adolescent antennae listening for the sound of a promise. \u201cAre you going to be weird,\u201d she said to him directly. He supplied her with a couple of honest answers, which was more than she\u2019d expected.\n\n\u201cI am going to try not to be,\u201d he said. He put the screwdriver down with the gravity of a man unloading a weapon. \u201cI will probably fail and then try again. You can call me out. I will attempt to take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and returned a screwdriver to the box upside down, on purpose, because kindness is not the only test a person needs to pass. Janine poured tea and did not ask him if he took sugar because she remembered he didn\u2019t; he pretended not to be surprised by her memory. They drank standing up because sitting down felt too ceremonial, and the hinge worked, and nobody mentioned that the cupboard door had closed easily for the first time in months.\n\nLater, rehearsal began with the silent agreement that they would not discuss last night until their bodies had done something with it. Madi had already drawn a square on the floor with blue tape that meant you could not stand where the square was unless you had something to offer it. \u201cWe\u2019re doing less,\u201d she announced, as if this would be greeted with a parade. \u201cYou did plenty. I want less for this next piece. Less that reads like more. Everyone wants fireworks. Give me matches. The internet will hate it and then three smart people will love it and we will sleep fine.\u201d She motioned them to the tape and they stepped in obediently, like apprentices who trust the sorcerer has thought this through.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d came Crispin, which is how men like Crispin announce themselves when they want points for manners. \u201cTwo things. One is small, one is also small if you are flexible. The stream wants a micro-doc. We do you at the house, domestic, old photos if your mother will share, dad story toned to acceptable pathos, we get a quote from Mr. Ellison because he is back in the picture, we talk about forgiveness. Second, we partner you for a brand live on Saturday. No product in frame, just vibes. You two in front of a wall of trainers. It\u2019s not an advert; it\u2019s a conversation about movement. Think youth, think energy, think Milton on a bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo to the house,\u201d Nate said, before the phrases had finished their attempt at being charming. The no felt like a coin he had polished. \u201cNo to dad stories on your camera. That\u2019s mine. If he wants to tell anything, he can do it in his own kitchen and you can ask him for directions, which he will get wrong. We don\u2019t make my mother tidy the living room for your pathos. Yes to the trainers if we can pick the wall, the time, and if the conversation isn\u2019t about shoes. We\u2019ll talk about floor. We like floor.\u201d\n\nCrispin twitched the way good salesmen twitch when a scheme needs to redraw itself. \u201cWe can do a corridor,\u201d he offered. \u201cNo home. But surely\u2026 we don\u2019t invent arcs; we just\u2026 follow them where they go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you call my mum\u2019s council letter an arc,\u201d Nate said, not angry, only done, \u201cI\u2019ll ask Dynamo to step on your brand new suede shoes. He\u2019ll know where to put his hoof, he\u2019s very precise. We\u2019re dancing. Let us dance. After, if I want to be sad in public, I will. Today is not that day.\u201d\n\nMadi, who could not in good conscience do violence on behalf of her dancers but could in good conscience suggest it beautifully, stepped half a pace forward. \u201cThe little films we owe the stream are about the work,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want tears, go to cinema. We\u2019ll give you sweat. You\u2019ll love it. Your mother will love it. The internet will complain, which means they will watch it three times.\u201d She did the smile that had persuaded more than one money person to back slowly away and leave the artists to it.\n\nCrispin raised his palms in agreeably defeated surrender and nodded as if he had planned to be told no as part of a long con. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, \u201cfloor chat Saturday. I\u2019ll text options. You two: not too clever. Clever is for critics. Real is for the people.\u201d He moved on to bother the boy in the silver hoodie, who had started pretending to stretch as a decoy and got punished by an earnest lecture about authenticity and headwear.\n\nWhen they were left to their square of tape and their section of air, Madi had them walk. Just that. Walk the square. \u201cEverything is in the walk,\u201d she said, a sentence every teacher says with a different kind of authority. \u201cIf your walk is honest, the trick lives in it. If your walk lies, I will see the lie in the turn.\u201d Maya obeyed the instruction with visible impatience that refined under observation into something like grace. She had the walk of a girl who has been on the receiving end of boys\u2019 attention and decided to direct it herself. Nate had a country walk that softened in a city and a stage walk that had learned not to apologise. They walked and then did not walk, which is to say they stilled themselves, and you could feel the shape of it for a long breath.\n\nOn a break, he stepped into the corridor that smelt of coffee and old carpet glue and called home, because his fingers needed the reassurance of his mother\u2019s ring tone. Janine answered on the third ring and had bread in her mouth, which somehow made her greeting warmer. \u201cThe hinge holds,\u201d she reported, before he could ask what was more important. \u201cWe have an email from the landlord\u2019s agent with words like index and fair. Mrs. Khanna\u2019s nephew says we can make a fuss and the fuss would be righteous. He offered to write words he calls templates. I\u2019ve always liked a template. He also says council have a quiet pot for people on the edges. He said edges like it was a place you could visit. We\u2019ll visit. For tonight, we\u2019re all right. Your father has left and he took his toolbox and left the bread and he didn\u2019t look round to see if I was watching because he is trying very hard. That\u2019s enough domestic for this call. Go and pretend to be normal at work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am normal at work,\u201d he said, smiling into the phone. \u201cWe\u2019re walking. Madi says my walk better be honest. I\u2019ll avoid my swagger because I haven\u2019t got one.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cSwagger breaks kettles. Bring me gossip later. I have stuck the banner at an angle and it is driving me wild. The house is testing me.\u201d\n\nMaya came back from her own call with her schoolbag still on her shoulder, which meant the phone had been with her father. \u201cHe said no to television,\u201d she reported with a mix of relief and annoyance that adult children will understand forever. \u201cHe said we can do a photo. He asked me if he should buy a hat. I said yes because I want to be a person whose father owns a hat he didn\u2019t need.\u201d She sat on the floor with the kind of exhaustion that has a degree. \u201cAlso, I did an exam. It was about friction, irony intended. I will pass. I might rage between now and the passing.\u201d\n\nHe lay down beside her and looked at the damp patches the ceiling had tried to repair after the last leak, like clouds had retired there and taken up plastering. \u201cWe will do less,\u201d he said. \u201cLess is a skill. My friend Jessa can smoke less. My mum can worry less. I can say no more and it counts as less of something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are being philosophical,\u201d she said. \u201cI like you with sleep. You should patent it.\u201d She rolled on her side to face him, plait trailing a map on the floor. \u201cLast night you did the panic catch and you didn\u2019t make it look like a catch. I just want you to know I know, and I won\u2019t tell anyone because I am kind, but I will weaponise it in a future argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect nothing less,\u201d he said, and they went back to counting the ugly ceiling stains like constellations.\n\nSaturday\u2019s trainer wall experience played out like all branded events try to: too much sound, not enough air, a DJ with confidence like a health condition and a crowd made of teenagers and their more skeptical older siblings. The wall glittered with shoes that had price tags like threatening letters. They stood in front of it and did precisely what they had promised Crispin they would do\u2014talked about floor. Maya did an excellent impression of a historian when she talked about lino versus wood, and Nate, asked by a boy in a fluorescent beanie which shoe made him dance better, said honestly, \u201cthe one I can forget I\u2019m wearing,\u201d and the manager, who had wanted him to say a particular number, sighed without hatred. Lyla filmed from a vantage point that made everybody\u2019s jawlines look expensive and added captions that would make a university professor fight a child. When they were done, a kid asked for a selfie and then, because courage acts like a muscle, said, \u201cMy stepdad says dance is for swots. What should I tell him?\u201d and Maya, without missing a count, said, \u201cTell him swots can do the splits,\u201d and the kid said \u201csweet\u201d with the triumph of a joke that counts as revenge.\n\nThat afternoon in the yard, ordinary paid Nate's balance. Lovey demanded he do a sign check on her feet and then pretended to be offended. Dynamo had a good day because the world had not given him anything brighter than it needed to. A girl of nine who\u2019d been sent to learn not to fear large animals stood with her hands deep in her coat pockets and announced, like a newsreader, \u201cI don\u2019t like noses because they do breathing,\u201d and Nate, because he too had sometimes suspected the nose of ulterior motives, showed her how to offer a palm and wait until the horse chose to bring the nose to the hand. The girl endured it the way children endure medicine that works and afterwards declared she was cured of noses and would like to ride a dragon next, something in the shovel-to-sky family.\n\nThat evening, Paul rang and sounded like a man calling from an empty room he was trying to make into a comfortable lie. \u201cThe man with the shoes called me,\u201d he said. He never did names when names felt like alliances. \u201cAsked if I wanted to talk about you. I told him I\u2019m learning. I told him I won\u2019t make our business belong to a man wearing jewellery on his wrist. He said he could blur things. I hung up on him because I have discovered I enjoy that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Nate said, aware of the strange shock of pleasure delivered by an adult behaving like an adult when you aren\u2019t expecting it. \u201cI\u2019m keeping the dancing for the dancing. You can keep the regrets for whatever they\u2019re useful for. We\u2019ll do a Sunday roast one day and you can apologise to potatoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do potatoes,\u201d Paul said with the cautious pride of a man recalling his one specialty. \u201cI can do gravy. I am still not coming to your house without warning. I\u2019ll ring. I\u2019ll see you next week. Don\u2019t\u2026 break.\u201d The line did the tiny crackle old lines do and then they were both released back into their respective rooms.\n\nAnya implemented a plan she had, she claimed, stolen from a stern Russian woman in 1998. \u201cWe train outdoors,\u201d she said on Monday, as the heating in the hall failed with an apologetic cough. \u201cYou think you know your balance, and then the grass says you don\u2019t. Bring layers. If you fall, learn something on the way down.\u201d They took their counts to the miserable heroism of a car park and then to the strip of municipal green with a wind that didn\u2019t love them. The first two passes looked like outtakes from a documentary about deer learning to skate. By the third, Nate could feel his ankles telling him the truth about themselves, and Maya discovered her left foot, the one with a tendency to stage a union meeting at awkward times, liked dirt better than sprung floor. \u201cI hate outside,\u201d she announced into her scarf. \u201cOutside can do one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOutside is where the horses are,\u201d he said, which was not an argument so much as a map.\n\nBy Wednesday, word had made its clumsy way around Milton in the way Milton did it\u2014two barbershops, a WhatsApp group for parents who never slept, the vicar\u2019s wife who pretended to hate gossip but relayed it with admirable fidelity. The pub had chalked Congratulations Stud! on the A-board with a little drawing that was either a horse or a man in an unfortunate hat. A boy with a BMX had added a moustache to the drawing while a barman watched and chose peace. The barbershop hummed with men who said they didn\u2019t watch dance and then quoted back lines Maya had said about floor. Tariq split himself between work and showboating like a man with two lovers and pulled both off because overpromising to the day was his art. He whispered in Nate\u2019s ear as he did his hair, \u201cThe phone has been a busy mother. Two new lads came in and asked for \u2018the Stud,\u2019 which is both offensive and satisfying. Look at me, coining a cut. I will retire with a cape.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t retire,\u201d Nate said, closing his eyes while the clippers did their kindly thunder. \u201cWho will narrate my life?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will record an audio guide you can play quietly on the bus,\u201d Tariq said. \u201cPress one for encouragement. Press two for roasting. Press three for a synopsis of the plot. By the way, Jessa is going to kill her boss. She won\u2019t, because orange isn\u2019t her colour, but she will write a letter and then read it out to weak men with clipboards. She told me to tell you to show your face at the youth club on Thursday and remind the children that dancing hasn\u2019t gone out of fashion since TikTok. Don\u2019t be late. She will set your shoe laces on fire.\u201d\n\nThursday at the youth club, the flooring situation gave up on being a situation and was a problem. The hall was a rectangle whose sides had seen multiple generations of cheap chairs. The stereo was a veteran of the Falklands or behaved like one. The faces in front of him were that wonderful mixture of disdain and curiosity that only children and cats carry off with grace. Lyla had already inflated her importance by shouting, \u201cAttention, peasants,\u201d something Jessa allowed on the grounds of comedy value and because the kids took it as intended. Nate introduced a step so basic it felt like breathing and then complicated it until even the surliest boy admitted his limbs could learn new vocabulary if bribed with praise. A girl in hooped earrings did a little shoulder isolation that would have impressed Madi and then shrugged when the room applauded it like she was tired of being applauded for the obvious. Jessa watched from the doorway with her cigarette absent and her hands in pockets, and afterwards she gave him a nod that was loud enough to count as a speech.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d she said, outside, when they were walking back toward the trolley bay that had never once had any trolleys in it. \u201cYou are in the habit of being good without making people lick your shoes for it. Keep that. Also, my boss can eat bin fire. He told me if I want breaks I should stop drinking water. I told him I\u2019ll stop drinking water when he stops needing oxygen. There will be a vote. I will pretend to play nicely. It will be sexy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get sacked,\u201d he said, knowing she would not take the instruction but liking the ritual of trying to save her from herself.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will. Or he will become softer. Pain does that to men when you apply it properly. I am an artist.\u201d She stopped to watch a fox swagger along the low wall opposite like it owned the postcodes of two counties and they both felt the rightness of the fox existing near bins and miracles.\n\nOn Friday, the thing with Dynamo was small in the way panic is small when you catch it early. He was off, not wrong, but off, the way a favourite song sounds weird when someone you don\u2019t like sings along. Nate noticed it in the shift of weight over the front right, the micro-stall that happens when an animal is arguing with pain but too proud to mention it. He called Mrs. Pritchard with the particular humility Lance Corporals use when addressing Generals and said, quietly, \u201cI\u2019m seeing something,\u201d and she, without drama, ran her hands down a leg that had been made before cars and machines and too-bright lights and said, \u201cStone bruise or a fairy. Cold hose it. He\u2019ll be swearing at you in an hour. If he\u2019s still telling me fairy stories tomorrow, we\u2019ll get the vet. Tell him I said he is not special and it\u2019s good for him.\u201d They did the cold hose, ten on, ten off, the kind of patient work that doesn\u2019t look like devotion and is, and Dynamo took it like a civil rights violation and then began to relax under the logic of water. Nate stayed long after the hose had been put away and listened to the quiet talk of big animals settling.\n\nHis father texted, unprompted, that he had found a better brand of tea and that he intended to make Nate drink it as proof of his commitment to improved taste. \u201cYou can\u2019t improve taste,\u201d Nate wrote back, and then after a beat added, \u201cCome by next Sunday if the kettle lets you. I will be home. You can meet my friend who smokes but not in the kitchen. We will not do feelings. We will do buns.\u201d He regretted it and then didn\u2019t; invitation had always been a muscle he avoided exercising for fear of dropping the weight.\n\nThere was talk, inevitably, on the internet about romantic tension. It had the tender, intrusive energy of aunties at weddings. Clips of the quiet part in their piece gained traction and the comments section decided it had invented softness. Maya forwarded him a screen grab of one speculative thread and captioned it with, \u201cDo we sue?\u201d and a picture of a gavel. He sent back a photo of Dynamo\u2019s ear and wrote, \u201cHe says privacy is delicious.\u201d They didn\u2019t mention the thing you don\u2019t mention when one of you is twenty-four and the other is eighteen and the air in between is complicated. They simply did the clean work and let the rest fuss in corners until it got tired.\n\nOn Saturday, which is when the city pretends to be a town because that\u2019s easier on the purse, the Centre was full of fathers with buggies practising in public and teenagers who had learned how to occupy space as anointment. Crispin turned up in a shirt his mother would have described as cheerful and tried to convince their piece to be performed at noon in a shop window \u201cfor the people,\u201d and Madi said, flat, \u201cOur people can buy tickets like anyone else,\u201d and then bought a pretzel with his company card and told them to take an hour for themselves. They sat on the steps by the fake lake and watched the fake ducks pretend to be above it all. Maya put her chin on her knees and said, \u201cIf I pass physics I will invent a new type of regret that doesn\u2019t sting and market it to poets,\u201d and he said, \u201cI will sell you to poets,\u201d and she said, \u201cI am too expensive,\u201d and they experienced the kind of quiet that is usually reserved for churches.\n\nSunday afternoon arrived the way Sundays do, with a funny sort of mercy that doesn\u2019t last the night. Paul showed up on time, carrying the tea and the kind of expression men wear when they have memorised the steps to a dance and intend to perform them without improvising. He had bought scones. He had not tried to bake. He took his shoes off at the door, delighting Janine and derailing her planned joke. Jessa came by with an excuse about borrowing a book and stayed to audition him gently. She said, \u201cDo you believe in unions?\u201d with the energy of a woman checking if a man is a vegetarian before she serves him a steak and when he said, \u201cI do now, after a man with a clipboard told me I couldn\u2019t use the toilet at a motorway depot,\u201d she granted him the right to eat the jam without commentary. They did not do feelings. They did buns. They did tea taste testing like children in a science segment. Lyla filmed none of it because she had a divine sense of when to act like a door, not a window. When he left, he put his hand on the hinge of the front door in a very silly symbolic gesture, rolled his eyes at himself, and said, \u201cIt holds,\u201d and Janine, by way of a benediction, said, \u201cFor now,\u201d and then closed the door with a softness that told the house it would be consulted next time.\n\nMonday\u2019s rehearsal was the best kind of boring, the kind of afternoon that disappears in the doing and leaves you with muscles that are grateful for instruction. Madi gave them notes that were less than sentences. \u201cLift: exhale,\u201d she said. \u201cEnding: don\u2019t present it like a birthday cake.\u201d Anya, from the back, offered silence, which was praise in her dialect. They left early enough for coffee that did not taste like disappointment and sat in a cafe that had assaulted the walls with plants until the oxygen had improved. Maya, mid-sip, asked, \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll teach?\u201d without adding anytime soon or when your knee starts misbehaving like an old Labrador.\n\n\u201cI might,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a peace in telling someone what to do with their feet and then watching the lightbulb. It\u2019s like mucking out. You can see the beginning and the end of a job. You feel taller inside your skin. But I don\u2019t want to teach because I\u2019m scared of failing at the other thing. I want to teach because the other thing is generous enough to be shared.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d she said, mock-wiping at her eyes with her sleeve. \u201cPoetry. People will think you\u2019re insufferable. I will tell them you are. They\u2019ll love you more.\u201d Her phone buzzed and she looked at it and frowned. \u201cThat man again. The one who wants to interview my ankle. I\u2019m going to block him and then unblock him out of curiosity and then block him again. Entertainment is a circle.\u201d\n\nHe walked her to the bus and leaned on the shelter that had caught more confessions than a confessional. The bus pulled in with that roar buses use to tell you they are bigger than your life, and she got on and turned back and did the ridiculous bow he pretended not to recognise, and then the bus left, and he stood with the discarded feeling that follows good company like a sensible dog.\n\nOn the way home he took the long cut through the little triangle of trees that made believe it was a wood and met Mr. Clancy leaning on a fence with an air of having leaned there before roads. \u201cThere\u2019s talk,\u201d Mr. Clancy said, which was a statement, not an invitation. \u201cAbout your father. About this and that. Men in pubs who hold forth. Don't listen to men who hold forth. They\u2019re only practicing their voices because they never got to sing.\u201d He spat with elegance and then offered Nate a peppermint in a way that implied he was giving him secrets. \u201cKeep your hands soft,\u201d he added. \u201cAnimals mostly talk in hands.\u201d\n\nAt home, the council letter had reproduced into an appointment. Mrs. Khanna\u2019s nephew had emailed PDFs with titles like Unexpected Outcomes and Precise Words That Make People in Offices Sit Down. Janine had found a pen that preferred blue and was writing in a list that contained the headings bread, rent, feelings, in that order. She looked up when Nate came in like a lighthouse acknowledging a returning boat and made room for him in the kitchen light with the ease of a person who had practised welcoming. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said, tapping the word on the page with the pen. \u201cWe will go to the office and I will make my voice do its thing. You will come and sit and breathe and look tall and responsible. Then you will run off at the last minute to dance if you must, and I will tell them the truth which is that you belong in more than one place. They will hate that. It\u2019s not efficient. It is, however, true.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, felt the stretch in his neck like a story being told, and went to the sink because washing up had always been the way he asked the day if it had any last words. The plate was warm under his fingers and he thought, as he sometimes did when the ordinary made itself important, that if someone had told him a year ago this would be what it would feel like to be in the middle of something, he would have laughed and called them ambitious for him and therefore to be avoided. He finished the mug, turned it upside down on the drying rack with its little collection of upside-down things, and thought, with a clarity that felt rented but generous, about counts and edges. Tomorrow, he would walk into a room where someone would say no to him and he would ask them to say it again with more honesty. Tomorrow, he would bargain for the right to live in the same rooms in which he had been made. Tomorrow, he would catch Maya mid-air and change the count again by the thickness of a hair.\n\nHe went to bed with the kind of tired that had dignity. Before sleep took him without fuss, he looked at his ceiling and considered the twenty-year-old cracks that had told his teenage self to be braver and found them in a kinder light. The house shifted the way old houses do when they remember stories they won\u2019t repeat. In the yard, Lovey dreamt from one foot and then the other, and Dynamo, resentful even in sleep, refused to forget the hose. In several pockets of the city, people who had clapped last night remembered their hands and smiled with them. On a phone on a bedside table, south of his, a girl with plaits sent a text that read, tomorrow we fight a camera and a bureaucrat, wear your lucky socks, and he wrote back, I have only lucky socks now, and then the night turned its face toward the corner of the room and allowed them rest.The council building had the kind of carpet that taught your shoes to whisper. It was a colour invented to make the idea of colour seem unreasonable, and there were posters over the radiator about compost and community that had faded into their own optimism. Janine walked in with her voice tied back and her bag full of proofs the way a magician carries scarves\u2014plentiful and ready. She had ironed the edge of a letter and it had succumbed. Nate walked beside her carrying height and a folder with his name on the tab, the kind of folder that grants you ten per cent more authority simply by existing. He had put on the jacket that pretended to be formal and succeeded only in looking like a man who owned a formal jacket. He took a breath as they crossed the threshold because buildings like this liked to take the air out of your lungs and tell you they were keeping it for the responsible people.\n\nMrs. Khanna\u2019s nephew had furnished Janine with a packet of words called templates and a pep talk that included a flow chart and a joke about bins that might have been funnier to a different family. Janine had highlighted the sentences that made clerks put their pens down and listen, and her pen had highlighted them again as if they might run off if not sufficiently fluorescent. The receptionist was a woman with hair that defied gravity and glasses that suggested she knew the end of every story before it began. \u201cName?\u201d she asked, and Janine gave it with the crisp of someone who has practice at not being mislabelled. They sat on the plastic chairs that made everyone the same height and watched as numbers marched up on a screen with no interest in context.\n\nWhen their number was called, they went through a door into an office that had decided potted plants could atone for fluorescent lights. The man behind the desk had a tie that was a few inches more optimistic than his posture. A little plaque said GRAHAM BAIN in letters that had resigned themselves to being read by people who would forget them immediately. Graham smiled in that scrupulous way of people who have been taught to leaven process with kindness. \u201cMrs. Ellison, Mr. Ellison,\u201d he said, with a glance at their faces like a mourner checking the hymn sheet. \u201cTell me what\u2019s happened and then tell me the bit you left out when you practiced at home.\u201d\n\nJanine\u2019s smile was for herself, which was safer. \u201cIt\u2019s the rent,\u201d she said. \u201cIt decided to grow. The sum and the audacity. We can pay what we\u2019ve been paying. We can nearly pay more if we do maths with fewer biscuits. The letter says index and review and expectation. I brought copies of everything including the breakfast we didn\u2019t eat.\u201d\n\nGraham looked at the copies. He looked at the letter from the landlord\u2019s agent that had tried to sound apologetic and had achieved only a sort of polite pounce. He looked at the template phrases and nodded in the way men nod when women have brought in the right weapons. He looked at Nate and did that thing bureaucrats with empathy sometimes do where they ask the right question in the wrong voice. \u201cAnd you, sir,\u201d he said, as if he were meeting a ship, \u201cwhat do you\u2026 what is your regular?\u201d\n\n\u201cI work at a yard,\u201d Nate said, because truth sounded humble and he hadn\u2019t brought his actress today. \u201cHorses. Three mornings. Sometimes more. I dance. It isn\u2019t regular, except it is, like weather is regular. This month there\u2019s a show. There\u2019s a bag of money in the corner of the room labelled maybe. That bit will be a one-off and not a guarantee. I can be responsible for the mornings and the afternoons. The evenings are variable.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s tie performed the trick of looking like a man nodding. He typed the sort of typing that makes other people nervous. \u201cThere are pots,\u201d he said, as if confessing that his house had a secret space under the stairs. \u201cWe call them discretionary, which means we\u2019ll ask nosy questions and you will sigh and then we will be able to help until we can\u2019t. There\u2019s also a fair use conversation with the landlord about the index they\u2019ve chosen and whether it applies to your lease or to a general sense of the economy. We can write that letter for you and sign it as if we invented the word fair this morning. Mrs. Ellison, I see you have already drafted something that looks very much like what I would write if I were at home and cross.\u201d He slid the paper toward himself and blinked at the accuracy. \u201cYou can use my signature as a garnish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Janine said, letting relief go through her without knocking anything over on the way. \u201cWe like garnish.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll freeze the increase while the right people argue,\u201d Graham added. \u201cFour weeks, possibly eight if we get lucky with daylight. Bring me wage slips, and that bit of the internet that proves you did the performance, because the powers like to see you doing something that looks like ambition in a hat. Bring me your tenancy, which I assume you have memorised, and something with numbers on it that made you cry last night. I will email Mrs. Khanna\u2019s nephew because anyone with a nephew who can explain an index to his aunt is a friend in this building even if he doesn\u2019t know it yet.\u201d\n\nThey signed in the boxes that declare you real on paper. Janine used her pen with the ruthlessness of someone winning a board game quietly. Nate signed his name in the way he signed it at the stables when he agreed not to die on the premises. Graham shook their hands like a man who had decided to make his desk temporarily a place where things happen. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ll hear a lot of no that sounds like maybe and a lot of maybe that sounds like no. I will translate. Also, my daughter saw you last night,\u201d he added, turning his tie into a parent, \u201cand cried for two whole minutes and then decided to berate me about the fact that she wasn\u2019t born with better ankles. So, thank you for that.\u201d\n\nOutside, the air felt like a reasonable document. Janine\u2019s shoulders had dropped into the degree of descent that meant her body had accepted that it did not have to fight the entire building single-handed. She held the strap of her bag and, because nobody important was listening, allowed herself a half-grin. \u201cHe was a good one,\u201d she said. \u201cNot good as in saint, good as in does his job and doesn\u2019t make me bite him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a tie,\u201d Nate said, and she nodded, filing it. They stood under a piece of municipal art that had been welded to be profound and decided it could wait to be interpreted. Janine looked at her watch, which did not believe in style, and said, \u201cGo on then. Fight your camera. My voice can carry me to the bus. Text me after. I will be at the table with my friend template and my enemy the brown envelope.\u201d\n\nThe floor conversation had been allotted nineteen minutes in a corridor with a wall the exact shade of biscuit nobody ever chooses first. The camera was a kind boy with shoulders that had learned not to take up too much space. The sound woman had hair like a rainforest and the face of a person who has forgiven a lot of doors. Crispin had ceded the role of lion tamer to a junior producer whose excitement was so sincere it managed to cancel out ninety per cent of the manipulation in the pitch. \u201cWe want to talk about your surfaces,\u201d she said, holding a clipboard that had never borne any nonsense. \u201cWhere your feet meet the day. The metaphor will do the heavy lifting. We\u2019ll keep you on your good side.\u201d\n\n\u201cI only have one side,\u201d Nate said. \u201cIt\u2019s in discussions with my other side.\u201d He and Maya stood where the tape told them to stand and immediately shuffled an inch to account for where their bodies preferred to be. These were the small negotiations that made things honest. He looked down at the floor as if it were a person he was about to quote.\n\n\u201cFloor is the first partner,\u201d Maya said into the friendly darkness of the lens, because she had filed away a sentence that made sense and was bringing it out like a good cake. \u201cIf the floor is lying, nothing else can be true. You can tell when a floor has been cared for because you feel like you\u2019re not going to be punished for trusting it. Wood talks. Lino whispers. Concrete judges you and then forgives you if you apologise properly. Grass hates you and then teaches your ankles lessons you didn\u2019t consent to.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoes are the lie you willingly tell,\u201d Nate added. \u201cYou wear the lie that lets you forget your feet until the moment you need to remember them. The day I realised a good shoe is the one you forget was the day my dancing stopped trying to be clever and started trying to be kind. I still fall. Everyone falls. The floor catches you or it tells you exactly why it didn\u2019t. That\u2019s useful. You can work with useful.\u201d\n\nThe camera breathed. The boy holding it nodded a little, which is always a good sign. The sound woman\u2019s rainforest hair wrote notes in the air. The junior producer mouthed we love it with the genuine fervour of a convert. Crispin lurked with his impossible smile and kept his hands largely out of the frame, perhaps because he had been told a story that morning about a runner and a horse, and the moral had been very clear and very muddy.\n\nAfter, Maya\u2019s phone chimed like a polite bell. She looked and then made an expression like someone trying not to show their working. \u201cPhysics,\u201d she said, flat with triumph. \u201cTwo marks under the best and six above the disaster my brother suggested I was heading for. Dad bought a hat,\u201d she added, apropos of nothing in particular, except that human success is often celebrated with something that doesn\u2019t fit. \u201cIt is not the correct hat. He bought a hat for a man who thinks jazz is an alternative to therapy. He is very pleased. He will wear it to the show and Anya will make a noise like a kettle and then relate breathing exercises to hats. It will be perfect.\u201d\n\nAnya made her kettle-noise that afternoon pre-emptively, which was efficient. \u201cHats are an attitude,\u201d she said, without being asked. \u201cThey should be worn by heads that understand chairs. Children, today we reduce again. Less legs. Less everything. We practice leaving the stage without apologising to it. Do not bow to anyone who hasn\u2019t paid you. That includes me.\u201d\n\nMadi\u2019s less turned out to be a kind of more that discouraged showing off not because showing off is bad but because showing off is easy. She stood in front of them with her clipboard tucked under her arm and spoke quietly until the room had to lean in to listen. \u201cThe piece is going to begin with you walking,\u201d she said, as if unveiling a miracle. \u201cThen it will continue with you listening. The trick is to let people believe they are watching while you are busy listening. On minute two we will show them one thing that they cannot do and then politely refuse to explain it. The internet will riot and three impressive people who go to bed early will send me messages about breath. I will pretend I don\u2019t like being told I\u2019m right and then sleep better.\u201d\n\nThe less had an honesty that scared Nate a little in the good way. When you strip back the cleverness you have to stand in the middle of the thing being yourself, which is exactly the sort of trick the cleverness was invented to avoid. He found the count for his steps inside the beat of his breathing and left the rest to behave. Maya discovered that her body had a quieter grammar that could be as rude as her loud one. Anya watched and pinched the bridge of her nose, which is how she told them she approved.\n\nBetween all that honesty, life persisted with its messy measure. Jessa won a little war at the depot by standing very close to a table and explaining to it why breaks are not a garnish. \u201cWe had a vote,\u201d she told Nate on the phone as she walked home past the allotments like a general out for a smoke. \u201cThe clipboard did not like democracy but he didn\u2019t set it on fire. We have ten minutes. Twenty on a Friday. We have the right to drink water when our throats decide to behave like throats. I will write a poem about this and then turn it into a threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t threaten them with poetry,\u201d he said, knowing she would and it would work.\n\nAt the yard, the stone fairy left Dynamo\u2019s foot as if it had been dared to stay and had thought better of it. Mrs. Pritchard, after twenty-four hours of telling the bruise to mind its manners, allowed a half sentence of satisfaction. \u201cYou found it quick,\u201d she said, which was praise even if the tone sounded like the underside of a shovel. \u201cHe was being dramatic for a reason. If he does it again, we get the man with the truck and your bank account will cry. Until then, water and the way you talk at him like he is the only living being with opinions. It suits him.\u201d Nate stood with his palm on the slope of the horse\u2019s neck and felt the big pulse doing the old work of being alive. He breathed the way you do when you are public with an animal who remembers the last time you got it wrong and forgave you anyway.\n\nPaul sent a photo of the hat, which was indeed a statement about jazz and poor decisions. He had set it on the arm of a chair like he was breaking the news gently. \u201cBe kind,\u201d the text said, which was both a request and a boast. Nate sent back a picture of the horse\u2019s ear, because that had become his shorthand for privacy, and typed, \u201cKindness requires a context. Bring cake.\u201d Paul replied that he could bring potatoes masquerading as cake and Nate allowed him this one sin because he had learned that adults are simply taller children trying not to knock over glassware.\n\nCrispin, arguably chastened, redirected his appetites towards the boy in the silver hoodie, whose mother turned out to have a voice like a chainsaw that could cut through red tape and insincerity. He also made serious eyes at the woman in the red dress and was sent away with a paragraph about art that started in French and ended in a swear that did not require translation. He hovered at the edges of Nate\u2019s day like a weather app told there is no rain and still hoping for headlines. Nate found the pleasure in saying small yeses that cost him nothing and big nos that kept the house from becoming a set.\n\nOn the Thursday when everything felt too possible, Maya\u2019s brother arrived at rehearsal trailing an air of being unimpressed by anything that couldn\u2019t be fitted into a meme. He looked at Nate, looked at the floor, looked at the mirror, and then nodded to himself like someone who had decided to give a restaurant a second chance. \u201cYou\u2019re tall,\u201d he announced, as if entering data into the public record. \u201cThat helps.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not always,\u201d Maya said, without turning her head. She was mid-stretch and had turned stretching into a statement about confidence. \u201cTall falls further. Introduce yourself like a polite person.\u201d\n\n\u201cArjun,\u201d he said. He shook Nate\u2019s hand and did the teenage trick of evaluating a man while appearing to be too bored to evaluate anything. \u201cIf you hurt my sister I will post your worst angles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of angles,\u201d Nate said. \u201cYou will be up late.\u201d\n\nArjun considered this for a second and then said to Maya, \u201cHe\u2019s all right,\u201d like he\u2019d been appointed to governance. He sat at the back with a packet of crisps and an attitude and clapped at precisely the moments his face said he wouldn\u2019t. Anya let him exist because he was good at keeping his feet out of the way and bad at pretending to be superior to sincerity.\n\nThe day of the stream rehearsal for their less piece arrived with a sky that had chosen one grey and married it for life. The stage didn\u2019t know how to behave for less; it wanted to do lights like an apology. Madi stood in the centre with her thermos and told the lighting operator a bedtime story about restraint. \u201cYou will not blind my dancers,\u201d she said, voice mild and carrying. \u201cYou will put light where they are and let it sit like a cat. If the light goes for a walk without permission I will take its batteries out and give them to the bar.\u201d\n\nThey did the walk and the listen and the one impossible thing that belonged to them, and the camera did what respectful cameras do when offered something that does not shout: it crept closer on a good lens and paid attention. Afterwards, in the room where snacks go to fail, a junior exec with a haircut that had cost too much declared that subtlety was a risk and then found himself agreeing fervently with his own nervousness when Madi smiled a way that said he could trust the person in charge or lose his budget. \u201cPeople will adjust,\u201d she said, like a weather report. \u201cThey\u2019ll pretend they discovered nuance this afternoon. Then they will show their mums.\u201d\n\nAt home, the kitchen table had become a war room. The pile of papers had been subjugated into three neat stacks. Janine had lines in her forehead you could plant crops in. She wielded a phrase from the template like a sabre and played with different tones of voice to see which one made the cat from next door jump. \u201cWe will say financial hardship and necessary,\u201d she declared to the teapot. \u201cWe will say risk and community and long-term. We will say tenant of good standing and we will refrain from adding \u2018with beautiful son\u2019 although I want to, on moral grounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraham said four weeks,\u201d Nate said, bringing her a mug of something that purported to be chamomile and smelled like a clever hedge. \u201cWe can make four weeks into six if we call it a process.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can make anything into six weeks with the correct adjectives,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all right today. Stop looking at me like you need to anchor me. I am an anchor.\u201d\n\nLyla was making a zine on the floor that would be illegal in six countries and very popular in a seventh. She had titled it The House That Would Not Move and was cutting out pictures of kettles and shoes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to sell this at your next thing,\u201d she informed him, scissor-waving. \u201cWe\u2019re going to call it merch and make thirty-seven pounds and then donate it to Mrs. Khanna\u2019s nephew because I like how he emailed back, like a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not sell anything without a charmingly incorrect QR code,\u201d Janine said without looking up. \u201cPeople love a chase.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the man from the brand with the wall of trainers sent a basket of fruit that had been arranged by someone who identified as a stylist first and a farmer fourth. The bananas had been convinced to sit at an angle that made them look coy. Maya took one and ate it out of spite. \u201cWe\u2019re not endorsing,\u201d she said, through banana. \u201cWe are endorsing floor. If anyone asks I endorse gravity. And soup.\u201d\n\nMr. Clancy was at the fence again with a peppermint and an unsolicited thought. \u201cI watched your thing,\u201d he announced, as if the internet were a field he occasionally grazed in. \u201cMy niece showed me on her phone. You looked like you were going to fall and then not. That\u2019s proper. No one wants to watch a man who thinks he\u2019s got a contract with standing upright.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my entire technique,\u201d Nate said. He took the peppermint and felt its ridiculous freshness clean his mouth in a way bureaucracy never could. Dynamo chose that moment to sneeze on his sleeve like an elder statesman condemning modernity, and Mr. Clancy nodded as if the horse had underlined his point.\n\nOn the way to the hall that afternoon he passed the pub with the A-board, and someone had changed the chalk to read LESS IS MORE, STUD and added a doodle of a fox wearing a hat that looked suspiciously like Paul\u2019s. He took a photo and sent it to his father with the caption your influence is corrosive, and Paul sent back a photo of a potato and wrote culture, and it was fine because sometimes love sounds exactly like nonsense.\n\nNate and Maya spent the last half-hour of rehearsal on the thing that had almost come off their hands the day before. It was a turning catch that required a very specific faith in the laws of physics not to suddenly decide to revise themselves for sport. They tried it once and it went, witless and obedient. They tried it again and Maya\u2019s weight did that tiny surprise that comes with human bodies even when they are clear on their intentions. He compensated, the way you do when dancing with weather, and corrected with his hips rather than his shoulders so the correction didn\u2019t become a label. Madi clapped once and said, \u201cYou earned it,\u201d and Anya did not interrupt the praise, which was its own fact.\n\nThey walked out of the hall under the evening that hadn\u2019t decided whether to be pink or efficient. In the little triangle of trees the air held a smell like cold bread and not much else. Maya linked her arm through his for half a dozen steps and then let go not because she needed to but because letting go was part of the trick. \u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d she said, almost surprised and more amused than anything else. \u201cI thought I would be scared every time and instead I am a machine with a slot for fear and it eats coins.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to save fear like pocket change,\u201d he said. \u201cPut it in a jar. Then I spilt it and realised I liked the sound.\u201d They stood by the bus stop where the glass had been cleaned to within an inch of its usefulness and watched a man hurry across the road carrying a cake without a box, the purest kind of risk. \u201cTomorrow the man with the ongoing haircut will ask us to do a thing in the foyer with a boom mic and we will say no with smiles and make ourselves tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow the internet will say we\u2019re in love,\u201d Maya said, cheerful because she knew facts and how to use them. \u201cWe will say that we are not and that you are married to floor and I am married to soup, and someone will draw a cartoon of you with a spoon. It will be unflattering. I will keep it for my wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow my mother will make something with tinned tomatoes and defiance,\u201d he said. \u201cMy father will put the hat on at the wrong angle. Jessa will send me a picture of an ashtray she didn\u2019t use and proclaim herself a saint. Tariq will tell a man that the shape of his head reminds him of a good story and then charge him extra for the narrative. Anya will disapprove of everything and be secretly proud. Mr. Clancy will have a peppermint. Dynamo will regard us all with horror.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we will do less,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will do so much less it will be rude.\u201d She got on the bus and found a seat and made the face she made when she was about to laugh and didn\u2019t because the driver deserved peace. She sent him a message before the bus pulled off: soup > floor, fight me, and the little typing dots on his screen were like applause he could keep in his pocket.\n\nHe walked the long way back to the house so the evening could put its hand on his shoulder and ask nothing. At home, the banner had been straightened and his mother had written the word grace on a sticky note and put it on the kettle, which was both on the nose and perfectly sensible. Lyla had found a new shade of glitter that got into your thoughts. The hinge held. The house did not make any grand claims and he did not demand any from it. He slept without rehearsing his lines for morning and dreamed he was a drum someone had put their ear to and called it music.",

                              "content": "They called him Stud because it made the lads at the bar laugh, and because he worked mornings at Milton Meadows where the horses breathed fog into the cold air and hammered the mud with their glossy hooves. The nickname stuck once a hen party from Wolverton wandered into the pub on a Thursday and the bride-to-be dared him to tango amid a tangle of stools and a jukebox with a stuck volume dial. He obliged with an exaggerated rose clenched in his teeth\u2014the rose was a napkin, the teeth were imperfect\u2014and he dipped the bride until her veil touched the floor. Someone clapped. Someone wolf-whistled. Tariq, who cut hair and liked to narrate whatever Nate Ellison did, shouted, \u201cStud\u2019s in the building, ladies,\u201d and that was that. Not Nate, not Nathan, but Stud, a word meant to tease that sounded like a badge if he squinted at it.\n\nMorning light was thin, chalked across a sky that still had bruises of night when Nate, boots clumped and stiff with dried clay, crossed the yard to the tack room. The smell met him first\u2014oil, leather, old straw, and that ammonia tang the winter cold couldn\u2019t cut. He liked it. The smell meant work, meant rhythm, meant something to wrangle. He set the muck fork against the wall and paused to listen. Horses shift differently from one another, he'd learned. You could tell which one was stamping in the far stall by the impatience in the thump. Dynamo, big bay with a neck like a proud crane? He stamped in measured, angry thuds. Lovey, the skewbald mare, trilled her lips when she was annoyed and pawed delicate at the straw as if trying to tidy it into an apology.\n\n\u201cHold your horses,\u201d he told them, because he knew they rolled their eyes when humans used that one. He felt the day gather and lean on him. He leaned back. Habit.\n\nIn the second stall from the tack room door, Dynamo tossed his head when Nate appeared, the whites of his eyes thin and bright. \u201cEasy,\u201d Nate murmured, slow in his hands and quick in his thoughts. He\u2019d seen the way Dynamo took to new things\u2014ears pinpricked, muscles coiled. The first week the horse had come in, a kid had carried a rainbow umbrella across the yard, and Dynamo had lifted on two legs like the sky had punched him.\n\n\u201cAngry man,\u201d Tariq liked to joke, slinging an arm over Nate\u2019s shoulders when he stopped by after the morning shift. \u201cYou get one word wrong with him, he\u2019ll write a letter to the editor.\u201d Dynamo didn\u2019t need words to file complaints. He had hooves. He had weight.\n\nNate mucked, fed, watered. He let the rhythm take him. He counted two measures for scoop, one for toss, one for rake, the pattern that had entered him years ago in a gymnasium with a too-shiny floor. He didn\u2019t talk about that part much. In Milton, you were a fighter or a footballer or someone always just about to be okay. A man who danced made people recalibrate their jokes. So Nate danced in the early, when horses took his beat as a friendly thing, and he danced past closing in the slow stretch of his kitchen when the kettle cooled and his tea thought about skinning over.\n\nHe kept it mostly to himself. Not entirely because of the jokes. There was also the way the music reached under his ribs and flicked the switch in him that said move, and he felt private about that, the climate under the ribs. If it were a landscape on a map, it would be labelled Here be dragons in red, and a little sea serpent would be writhing there, everything muscular and glossy.\n\nThat morning he finished just before eight. He checked on Lovey\u2014who sneezed into his shoulder and left a wet smudge\u2014and he let his fingers rest beneath the velvet bone of Dynamo's jaw, where the pulse galloped even when the horse stood statue-still. \u201cIt ain\u2019t all bad,\u201d he told him. \u201cSome things don\u2019t want to eat you.\u201d\n\nOutside, the frost had decided to be decorative and laced the fence-rails with a look of expensive cake. The pond had a thin white skin. Nate\u2019s breath went out and came back as a ghost that didn\u2019t know where else to haunt. He adjusted his scarf, a present from his sister Lyla that was far too bright for the sober fields\u2014acid green, would prompt cows to file formal complaints\u2014and walked toward the lane.\n\nHis phone buzzed in his pocket with a feeling like a bee trapped under a glass. He fished it out with his thick gloves between his teeth because he\u2019d learned that leaving messages unread made his chest fill with moths. On the screen, a notification sunrise: Congratulations Nate! You\u2019ve been shortlisted for the finalists\u2019 showcase of Dance/Drive: City Edition.\n\nHe stopped walking. He didn\u2019t even feel the cold, for five heartbeats. Then the cold came back with interest, a tax on surprise. He read it again and again, the words refusing to believe they\u2019d been sent to someone like him. Dance/Drive had started out niche, late-night on very early cable. An all-styles competition without the glitter or sob stories, the kind that takes place in repurposed car parks and above abandoned hardware shops. It had gotten bigger, then bigger still, until it finally landed on a streaming platform with a logo everyone knew. And now this season the City Edition was coming to Milton Keynes, a chance at the massive stage in the Centre:MK with lighting rigs like alien skeletons and seats like the curved teeth of a smile.\n\n\u201cStud?\u201d Tariq\u2019s voice drifted from the barber shop doorway across the lane. Tariq was sweeping hair into a tactical mountain he\u2019d later conquer with a dustpan. He wore his apron and his look for customers, which was glossy and leaned back. \u201cWhat\u2019s that face?\u201d\n\n\u201cSpam,\u201d Nate lied, then failed at it immediately. He crossed the road, boots loud. \u201cNah. It\u2019s\u2014Tariq. They\u2019re going to put me in the finals showcase. The finals, mate.\u201d\n\nThe broom froze. \u201cDon\u2019t wind me up, I\u2019m too delicate in the mornings.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome here, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d He held the phone out. He needed somebody else\u2019s eyes to confirm the words, in case his had been faulty all these years. Tariq read. He tried to give the phone back and missed Nate\u2019s palm twice. \u201cBoy,\u201d he said finally, a brand of joy that sounded like a warning. \u201cBoy. Boy.\u201d\n\nNate laughed. It came out of him like he\u2019d swallowed something fizzy and was now a bottle with a bad idea. \u201cYou\u2019re going to overboy yourself and fall over,\u201d he said.\n\nTariq put the broom against the wall like it tired him to look at it. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell two people. That\u2019s all. Just two.\u201d He lifted his hand. \u201cNo, three. Four. Five would be vulgar.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone yet,\u201d Nate said, with a reflex that came from years of not wanting to wave at possible joy in case it turned around and vanished into a lane of fog. \u201cThey might change their minds. Get my name wrong. Mix me up with someone else. They\u2019ll be like, we meant to say \u2018Matey Ellie-something who can\u2019t dance,\u2019 apologies for the confusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey spelt your name right,\u201d Tariq said. \u201cYou\u2019re famous now, Stud. I\u2019m going to charge you more for a fade.\u201d\n\nNate grinned to show he didn\u2019t mind the razzing, and to hide how his hands had started shaking. He tucked the phone into his pocket, like a rabbit he hoped would not wriggle free.\n\nWhen he got home, his mother was at the table with a pen cap behind her teeth and the Morning Citizen spread in front of her. Janine Ellison was small and endless, the kind of person who had a voice that knew how to reach its own echoes and bring them back. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said, without looking up. \u201cMake tea.\u201d\n\nHe brushed her hair, out of habit more than necessity. \u201cI smell like a damp accident,\u201d he warned her. \u201cTea will be contaminated.\u201d\n\n\u201cTea is one of nature\u2019s disinfectants,\u201d she said. \u201cSo is a biscuit. I read this somewhere and I refuse to check if it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou read it in your heartbeat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my what?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d He put the kettle on and stared at the old streaks of lime down its side like the rings of a tree. He had promised himself he\u2019d tell her after tea, when the handle of the mug was warm against his palm and the kitchen had earned its easier mood.\n\n\u201cLyla\u2019s at school?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cUnless they changed the date while we weren\u2019t looking.\u201d Janine circled something in the paper with such precision you\u2019d think it was an exam answer that would earn a scholarship. \u201cWhat is Park View Gardens? Is that the one with the murder hedges? Who murdered whom?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hedges murdered the gardener,\u201d Nate said, obeying the ritual. He waited. He felt the words a little queue inside him. She looked up, no pen cap now, her gaze steady.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened,\u201d she said in the tone she reserved for when she knew something had happened. \u201cGood or bad?\u201d\n\nHe poured the tea a little too quickly. \u201cI\u2026 I got an email. Dance/Drive. You know, that dance thing. They watched my clip. They want me for the finals showcase. The one at Centre.\u201d\n\nThere was a short silence that felt like the house inhaled. Janine\u2019s chair scraped. She stood and her face did a thing that only a few faces can do, the thing where you\u2019re trying to appear measured because you are the mother, and your child is watching, so you must be the horizon. It lasted a second. Then she was laughing and her hand was over her mouth and there were tears in her eyes that she had chosen to classify as morning allergies. \u201cOh, my boy,\u201d she said. \u201cMy love. Look at you.\u201d\n\nHe looked at himself; he was muddy and he\u2019d nicked his knuckle on Dynamo\u2019s stall latch and there was straw in his hair like confetti from a cheap wedding. \u201cI need a wash,\u201d he said, because sometimes you say trivial things when the room swims. Your mouth needs somewhere to put the air.\n\n\u201cYou need a crown,\u201d Janine said. \u201cYou\u2019ve needed a crown for a long time.\u201d Her eyes went somewhere he couldn\u2019t follow, the past where his father stood with his hand on the door and the car idling and a suitcase in the back that weighed more than any suitcase should. She reached towards him, then put her hand back down, then reached again. She never was sure with him. He wasn\u2019t sure either. \u201cWhen is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say three weeks. Rehearsals next week. They pair us up with partners this afternoon at registration. It all moves fast, I think. Like a blender.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you be all right? Your knees.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy knees love me very much,\u201d he said, because he didn\u2019t tell her about the nights when ice packs became his small gods. He drank his tea too quickly. He wished the kitchen window were a television and it could show him the future, even just the opening credits.\n\nHe washed and changed. The stained mirror above the sink did its best; it had a generous soul. He looked like what he was: twenty-four, tall, not as handsome as the nickname suggested but not far off either, with a face that had a habit of being open even when he consciously drew shutters down. He had shoulders that had carried hay bales and his mother\u2019s grief in equal measures, and arms that remembered choreography the way some arms remember bruises. He put on the clean jeans, the better jacket with the elbow patches, the trainers that made him quick. He examined the scarf and decided it could retire for the day.\n\nOn the bus into the centre, he sat by the window and let Milton roll out as if someone were unscrolling it from a high shelf. The big shopping centre hummed in the distance, the mirrored glass like a promise that a person could be more than three streets and a habit. The bus passed the indoor ski slopes, the boxy offices with their sensible blinds, the little parks with benches named after people whose families missed them publicly. He felt the machine of the city under him, not just cars but something slower and more complicated: ambition out for a walk. He got off at the stop where everyone got off or on, near the artificial lake that had ideas above its station.\n\nThe registration hall had been a conference room and would be again. For now it was all black fabric and cables disguised as snakes, a low stage, propped lights, a table with a line. Nate took a breath and got in line. The room smelled of coffee and hairspray and nerves. A poster with a logo told him he belonged here if he could read. He read it slowly. Belonging is a word that moves its own furniture.\n\n\u201cName?\u201d the girl at the table asked him when it was his turn. She had cheeks that made dimples when she concentrated, a pencil behind her ear like a cartoonist.\n\n\u201cNate Ellison,\u201d he said. His voice tried to be casual and overshot. \u201cI sent the clip. It was the warehouse one with the\u2026 with the yellow ladder.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, ladder guy,\u201d she said, consulting a list. \u201cWe gave you bonus points for not falling off and suing us. Okay, Nate. Your partner assignment is in here.\u201d She slid an envelope across the table. He wanted to tell her that her hands were steady in a generous way, but he didn\u2019t. \u201cRehearsal schedule\u2019s in the envelope too. Tech will make you sign seventeen forms about electrocution.\u201d\n\n\u201cElectrocution and being electrocuted,\u201d Nate said. \u201cDifferent brands.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh.\u201d She smiled the dimples again. \u201cThere\u2019s a vending machine outside with the good crisps. Everyone will tell you it's broken. It's not. It just needs to be slapped with the left hand.\u201d\n\nWhen he stepped away, the envelope in his hand weighed more than it could. He put his thumb under the flap and hesitated. He wanted to remember this second\u2014the one where something unknown was still perfectly shaped by its mystery. He told himself to move. He tore. He spilled paper.\n\nHe read the name. Maya Choudhury. He said it under his breath to taste it. He recognized it. He had seen her on screens, the local hip-hop phenom with a way of making gravity jealous. She danced like electricity learned to be a person. He\u2019d seen a clip months ago of her in a car park near the hospital, stomping and slicing through music that sounded like an alarm softened in velvet. Seventeen years old then, maybe eighteen now. He felt both relief and the tickle of intimidation.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s good,\u201d someone said over his shoulder, a voice like shoelaces being tied. He turned. The speaker was a woman maybe fifty, hair pulled back in a stern bun that didn\u2019t believe in whimsy, eyes that had measured many stages and found them wanting. \u201cMaya.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t know why he felt compelled to explain himself. \u201cI don\u2019t usually do\u2014well\u2014I do some styles, and I\u2019m fine with hip-hop, not fine like fine fines, but.\u201d He ran out of words and stood in the bright jungle of his own hands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Anya,\u201d the woman said. Not a smile. Not a frown. Something like the pause in between. \u201cI teach Maya sometimes. I also tell her off. Are you the boy from the warehouse?\u201d\n\n\u201cLadder guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou looked better with the ladder,\u201d she said, not unkindly. \u201cYou will have to keep up. She can be a little storm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good in weather,\u201d he said. She tipped her head, considering him as if he were a piece of furniture someone had dragged in and she wasn\u2019t yet sure where it should go.\n\n\u201cMaya is late,\u201d Anya said. \u201cShe has school. Or she is pretending to have school. Both can be true. If she makes a joke about detention, you must laugh.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it funny?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d She waited. \u201cThat was a joke.\u201d She turned as someone called her name.\n\nNate found a chair along the wall and sat. Dancers stretched in the middle of the floor, bodies performing math. A boy in a silver hoodie leapt, touched his toes midair, landed. A woman in a red dress that defied the usual rules of physics did a slow hip isolation that could move tides. The air in the room had bits of anxiety in it, like glitter you never quite clean up. He found himself scanning for her. He had only seen her through pixels, the way a child in a small town watches the news and wonders how cities are lit. When she arrived, he knew before anyone said. Her hair was in two long plaits down her back, her backpack was one of those with patches and pride. She had a pen behind her ear, like the girl at the table, but hers had leaked a little, in a way that looked like a signature.\n\n\u201cNate,\u201d she said, crossing to him as if the room were a field she owned. \u201cI watched your clip. You did that thing with the chair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chair was tired,\u201d he said. \u201cI helped it sit down.\u201d It came out easier than he\u2019d expected. Her grin was quick, a slanted line that looked like handwriting. \u201cMaya?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaya,\u201d she agreed, and stuck out her hand. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late. I got hijacked by physics. It wanted to fight today.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you win?\u201d\n\n\u201cPartial victory. The teacher says I don\u2019t show my working. Which is true of many parts of my life.\u201d She dropped her bag and the pen followed, skittering under a row of folding chairs like a mouse. \u201cAnya is watching, as usual. She\u2019ll pretend she\u2019s not. She\u2019ll tell me to stretch my feet and my mind. She\u2019s right. It\u2019s annoying.\u201d\n\nThey bent over the form together, sleeves nearly touching, shoulders learning each other\u2019s slope. The form asked them to list injuries, allergies, fears. Maya wrote hay on a line and looked up at him. \u201cAre you hay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am at least twenty percent hay at any given time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re allergic?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot properly. Just enough that I sneeze when I pretend to be a horse. It\u2019s useful socially.\u201d She squinted at him. \u201cAre you the Stud?\u201d\n\nHe waited a second too long. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014some people call me that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, Stud,\u201d she said, her grin again. \u201cSorry. I like calling people things they\u2019re not entirely sure they want to be called. It\u2019s a hobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people like tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cYou like identity crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d She pushed her hair back. \u201cLook, I can do the fast stuff. That\u2019s my thing. You can do the\u2014what did you call it in your clip? The roll?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Cuban roll,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fan. And that thing where your feet don\u2019t tell you they\u2019re moving but then they are, and it\u2019s too late to ask to be slowed down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be good,\u201d she said with a conviction that made the air change shape. He believed her before he allowed himself to agree. \u201cWe\u2019ll mix. Make new soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t mix all soups,\u201d he said. \u201cTomato and vegetable is fine. Minestrone and lemon chicken is a warcrime.\u201d\n\n\u201cArrest me.\u201d She bounced on her toes, a small bright chime of joy in motion. \u201cShow me your basic.\u201d\n\nHe stood. He didn\u2019t warm up properly because nerves are warm by themselves. He took a breath that went down where it needed to. He took the first weight on the ball of his foot, the way he\u2019d been taught in that old gymnasium by a woman with a sharp eye like a needle and a hand that could correct your posture and your soul. He moved against the idea of a drum. He felt the room settle its watchful eyes on him and then he stopped noticing. Music didn\u2019t have to be audible. He carried it, a private radio.\n\nWhen he looked up, Maya was watching him with her head tipped and her mouth small and thoughtful. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cOkay, you can stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to anyway,\u201d he said, and she laughed. Across the room, Anya pretended to frown at something else. The boy in the silver hoodie clapped lightly. Nate\u2019s hands stopped shaking. It happened slowly, like weather changing.\n\nThey rehearsed for an hour. They learned the way they would argue\u2014Maya quick, a stack of ideas and arms; Nate methodical, stubborn, a tendency to repeat until he felt the idea settle into the bones. She teased him and he let her. He corrected her weight transfer and she let him. When they had a rough eight counts that didn\u2019t offend either of them, they looked at it like it was a child they\u2019d made in a science experiment.\n\n\u201cThat bit,\u201d Maya said, pointing to where her shoulder sat under his hand like a bird under a roof. \u201cDo we want it to be romantic? Or\u2014what\u2019s the opposite of romantic? Practical?\u201d\n\n\u201cHydraulic,\u201d he offered. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it hydraulic. People like romance until it leaks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re weird,\u201d she said with approval. \u201cI like it.\u201d She fished in her backpack and brought up a bottle of water with stickers on it\u2014No bad vibes\u2014but all the bad vibes were, in fact, invited. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty-four.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrandad,\u201d she said, and avoided his wrist when he went to flick at her plait. \u201cKidding. Only a bit. You\u2019re tall. That\u2019s good. People think tall is better until tall falls over. Then everyone laughs, and you can\u2019t be angry because you deserve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve fallen?\u201d\n\n:She looked away, quick. \u201cOnce, at a battle. Not a big one. My foot did a thing and then my face did a thing and then my pride did a thing. It was educational.\u201d\n\n\u201cEducation is overrated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that. I have an exam tomorrow. If you jinx me I will choreograph my revenge.\u201d Her phone buzzed. She glanced. \u201cMy mother will want pictures of you to cross-reference with her danger database.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I dangerous?\u201d\n\nShe considered him. \u201cYour elbows are a menace. Other than that, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThey spilled out of the rehearsal hall at the end of the hour into a corridor that had been decorated by someone with a tight budget and a fondness for maroon. People were talking in that special way people talk when they\u2019ve survived something small together\u2014louder than necessary, words bumping into each other and apologizing. \u201cTea?\u201d Nate asked, because afterwards you drink something. He\u2019d learned to build rituals out of whatever he could hold.\n\n\u201cI have to be at school,\u201d Maya said, which he suspected was the truth, but she held his gaze and added, \u201cBut that sounds like an invitation. Raincheck.\u201d\n\n\u201cRaincheck,\u201d he said, a word that made less sense the more he thought it. He watched her go until she turned at the end of the corridor and did a little ridiculous bow he wasn\u2019t supposed to see.\n\nWhen he got outside, the afternoon had arranged itself into a thin and bright shape. He breathed and the breath had new width. He texted Tariq: Partner is Maya. He added a fire emoji because he had recently learned to use emojis for punctuation, something Lyla had mocked him for with a kindness that still stung. Tariq texted back sixteen faces with hearts for eyes and one eggplant that was probably an accident and then of course, not an accident at all.\n\nOn the bus home, he took the long way, the one that skirted the leisure plaza and then cut past the old Fishermead houses with their straight lines and persistent laundry. He got off two stops early because the sky was doing something and he wanted to be under it. He cut down by the allotments where the old men grew things bigger than science suggests, passed the fence with the painted dragons his sister had helped do with the youth club, and reached the meadow where the path narrows and the river does its own choosing. He could have been religious sometimes. Not about God, necessarily, but about the river, and the way the horses stood on the far side with their heads low and their ribs moving, and the way winter sunlight makes a promise it keeps in a small way.\n\nHe found Jessa by the gate, bundled in a coat that went down to her shins like a second, tougher skin. She was a friend from childhood, the kind that could tell him to stop without making him stop liking her. She smoked, always, as if she owed herself that small fire. She worked nights at the printing depot and had the schedule of a bat. \u201cYou\u2019re radiant,\u201d she said when she saw him, smoke curling like punctuation. \u201cWhy is that? Did you fight a man and win?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d he started, and didn\u2019t have to finish. Jessa squinted, then exhaled hard enough to put out a candle.\n\n\u201cOh, you got it,\u201d she said, affection and exasperation and something else. She did not say boy. She did not hug him, because that wasn\u2019t who she was, but she tilted her head in a way that made him feel pushed into the light anyhow. \u201cAbout time, Stud. Everybody knows you were going to. Even me. Which is difficult, because I barely know anything before half three.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s just a showcase,\u201d he said, because the part in him that was prepared for disappointment carried a sponge. \u201cNot like I\u2019m on the telly. Not yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cA small thing,\u201d she said. \u201cA big small thing. Does your mum know?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe knows. She told me I need a crown.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not wrong.\u201d Jessa flicked ash and watched it tumble. \u201cYou took your time, didn\u2019t you? Dancing. Like you had to ask permission from the weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I took my time because I was busy with other things,\u201d he said, and it was true, but not all of it. \u201cAlso, there\u2019s Dynamo, who might decide one day that I deserve to be a ghost.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and that ruddy horse,\u201d she said. \u201cOne day he\u2019s going to end up on the news and you\u2019ll be on the news by proximity. Move away from proximity, Stud. It\u2019s contagious.\u201d She stamped her boot, then tapped her cigarette out and tucked the stub neatly into a little silver case. She was always organized in the ways people didn\u2019t expect. \u201cI\u2019m coming to watch,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hate it,\u201d he said. \u201cToo many people. Too much\u2014everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can hate things and still attend them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my few talents.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to tell her about Maya\u2019s shoulder under his hand, the precise math of it. He wanted to tell her about how the room had watched and then the room had gone away. Instead he said, \u201cYou remember when we were in Year Nine and we did that thing at the community centre? The one where we had to pretend to be trees?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was the best tree,\u201d she said, bristling. \"I swayed. I threw shade.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were an award-winning tree,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew, then. I didn\u2019t know what to do with it. But I knew.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him the way she did when the cigarette case was out and she had no props. \u201cYou\u2019ve always known,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been pretending you didn\u2019t know because pretending is easier to do when you\u2019re tired.\u201d She touched two fingers to the air between them, not his hand but the idea of his hand. \u201cGo on then. Be the thing.\u201d\n\nAt home, Lyla burst through the door with her hood up and her cheeks reddened by the kind of cold that makes every laugh sound like glass. She threw her schoolbag at the sofa and missed. \u201cYou\u2019re famous,\u201d she announced, because anything that happened to one of them happened to both. \u201cEllison, you are trending, I\u2019m telling you. I posted your warehouse clip under a hashtag and two people I don\u2019t even know liked it.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are building brand,\u201d she said, dead serious. \u201cWe are building empire. We\u2019ll start with Milton. We can probably conquer Wolverton by Tuesday and after that\u2014Buckingham? Maybe not. They are stubborn. We can bribe them with\u2026 with something from Greggs.\u201d\n\nHe picked up her bag and put it on the sofa and she grabbed it in one motion and sat on it as if it were a living thing that might run. \u201cMaya,\u201d she said, with the relish of someone who enjoys proper nouns. \u201cShe\u2019s sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call people sick,\u201d Janine said from the kitchen. \u201cNot in my house.\u201d\n\n\u201cSick like good, Mum. Keep up. She\u2019s eight thousand followers good. She did that thing on top of the car that one time? Remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose car?\u201d Janine asked, as if it mattered for legal reasons.\n\n\u201cAnya\u2019s,\u201d Lyla said. \u201cNobody died. She\u2019s famous. You\u2019re going to dance with a famous person. Which will make you famous by osmosis, which is like chemistry but better hair.\u201d She bounced on the sofa bag-chair-throne. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. He looked at his mother, at the tea that had become the day\u2019s idol, and he admitted, \u201cYes. I am. I feel like my heart took up jogging without me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSave your jogging for the dance,\u201d Janine said. \u201cNo running in the house. It gets the rain in.\u201d She set plates down with the care she reserved for food, the thing that had to be made into enough. \u201cWhat time do you have to be where tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cNine at the stage,\u201d Nate said. \u201cTen with Maya. An hour with the choreographer after that. Then a break. Then camera blocking, which sounds\u2014violent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not violent,\u201d Lyla said. \u201cIt\u2019s sexy. Everybody says it. It\u2019s, like, sexy camera time. The camera is learning how to love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Janine said. \u201cSomebody should.\u201d She said it offhand, like a joke to keep the air appropriate for children. He felt the weight of it anyway, a plate placed gently and felt anyway. \u201cSleep,\u201d she added, pointing at him with a spoon like a general. \u201cDon\u2019t pace. You get the rug tired.\u201d\n\nHe tried to sleep early. He lay on his back and watched the slow machine of his ceiling fan turn his room into a calm geography. He had never been much for prayer, but he made a list of things he wanted and asked the ceiling fan as if it were something else. He wanted music he could survive. Partners who didn\u2019t give up on him. Knees that remembered their promises. A show that didn\u2019t insist he be someone else for the benefit of the screens. He wanted, more than anything, to get to the moment where he was on stage and the light found him when he wanted to be found.\n\nHe slept. It was the kind of sleep that felt like a very brief tunnel.\n\nThe second day in the rehearsal hall, Maya arrived on time and very nearly fell over a boom mic. \u201cSecond day,\u201d she said, breathless for no reason, then made jazz hands. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to rebrand as reliable. It\u2019s going to be short-lived but glorious.\u201d\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d he said, and they went back to work. The choreographer they\u2019d been assigned was a woman called Madi who wore black and smiled like a blade. \u201cI want joy,\u201d Madi told them, \u201cbut joy that knows pain. I want the edges of you. Where is the place you\u2019re not comfortable going? Go there all morning and then tell me when you get back.\u201d Maya bowed. Nate swallowed. They went there. They found a move that felt like a confession disguised as a lift. They fought over a count and then loved the way it landed. They learned each other\u2019s hands. They learned, too, the small resistances. Maya could not abide it when he pulled without warning; Nate could not abide it when they skipped a drill before he felt safe inside it. They got a little angry and then realized their anger was a cloud passing. They did not pretend clouds weren't clouds. They let the light be different for a while and then said something stupid, like the words for soup, and the cloud wandered off.\n\nAnya watched them and took notes with a pen that looked like it clicked, and didn\u2019t. \u201cMaya,\u201d she said, at one point, without looking up, \u201cyour left foot has turned into a liability. Don\u2019t encourage it.\u201d When Maya rolled her eyes, she added, \u201cHe\u2019s good for you. You should tell him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am right here,\u201d Nate said, and Anya looked at him full on for the first time that morning.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are. Don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d Then she put her eyes back on the pen that didn\u2019t click. Being seen and dismissed in the same breath was reassuring, somehow. It meant you had arrived in the place where work, not label, mattered.\n\nThey spilled sweat on the floor. They wiped it up. They drank too little water and argued about it. They laughed because their stupid lift looked like two teenagers trying to move a sofa through a door that hated them. Madi clapped the tiny sharp claps of approval that didn\u2019t pretend not to be proud. Around them, other pairs did their own versions of success and its ugly cousin. The room was a bowl full of yes trying to be said in six different languages.\n\nAfter lunch\u2014a sandwich that had ambitions above the bread it came on\u2014Madi handed them a sheet. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said, \u201cmedia day. Interviews. Photos. Wear whatever says you and your grandma. They like grandmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I say my grandma is dead?\u201d Maya asked.\n\n\u201cThey like that too,\u201d Madi said, not unkind. \u201cDon\u2019t get swallowed by stories. We dance first. We dance best. Then they can ask which is your good side and how you got here.\u201d She turned to Nate. \u201cHave you got your answer ready for how you got here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI came on the bus,\u201d he said, and Madi\u2019s blade-smile softened.\n\n\u201cKeep that one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut keep the real one too.\u201d\n\nHe thought about that on the bus home. How did you get anywhere? With tiredness? With love like a stubborn plant? With a friend who knew when to smoke outside your good news? With a mother who knew how to laugh through a hurt so it didn\u2019t think it won? He arrived not because of himself alone. The thought comforted and unnerved him; it made him consider the line between deserving and grateful and how light walked it like a wire.\n\nOn the third day, in the churn of rehearsal and the small domestic war between onstage and off, he went to the stables before dawn. He liked the way the world loved him there without screens. The horses\u2019 bodies made sense when nothing else did. He mucked out, he fed, he checked Dynamo\u2019s shoes and ran his hand over the horse\u2019s flank with the respect you owed to muscle that didn\u2019t know you were trying to love it. Dynamo snorted and tossed, then accepted him as a fact like cold. Nate leaned in and breathed in and tasted the day without polish.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t like the music,\u201d he told Dynamo, imagining the bright keys and the beat like someone knocking at the door in a hurry. \u201cBut you\u2019ll like the people. Or\u2014no, that\u2019s not true. You won\u2019t like any of it. But I do. And I\u2019m asking you nicely not to do anything. Okay? Please?\u201d\n\nDynamo flicked an ear and shunted his weight from one leg to the other, silent as a cathedral. Nate scratched the spot under his mane that made him stand like he\u2019d realized his own outline. \u201cI mean it,\u201d he said, because he always insisted on being understood by things that didn\u2019t speak his language. \u201cBehave.\u201d\n\nThe horse breathed, which was the only agreement Nate was going to get.\n\nWhen he left the yard, two kids were hanging on the gate, faces pink, noses running. \u201cAre you going to be on TV?\u201d one asked sharp as a knife.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Nate said, because yes was too naked a word. \u201cDepends on if I do as I\u2019m told.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you do that thing where you spin on your head?\u201d the other asked. His hat had cartoon ears that gave him a look of permanent misinformation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll break my neck,\u201d Nate said. \u201cI can do a thing where I spin on my hope and try not to fall over.\u201d They blinked at him. He winked. He left.\n\nHe carried with him the day and the people in it like pins in the inside of his jacket. He and Maya were good. They were getting better. Underneath, he felt a shape of fear he didn\u2019t give voice to. Shapes without names have a way of slipping through doors and making themselves at home.\n\nMedia day arrived with an aggression only people with clipboards can muster. Nate had never been so coaxed into sitting down. \u201cTell us about your journey,\u201d a woman with a microphone asked. She had hair that didn\u2019t move and a smile you could put your coffee on. He told her about the warehouse and the ladder and the way a man had once taught him a spin over a shouted lesson in an underheated gym. He told her about working at the stables and how his friend thought the word stud was funny. He did not tell her about the nights when he put his head against the cold window and asked the dark to be careful with him.\n\nThey took photos. Maya leaned into him like they did this every day. He tried to look like he belonged in photographs, a separate art. He felt the flash and the buzz and the metal scaffolding of attention being built around him. He said thank you too many times. He shook hands he would not remember later. He was careful, always, to find Janine in the crowd and tip his chin so she knew he was still himself underneath the bright.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Maya whispered when she saw his eyes flick to his mother, the way you look for a familiar building when you suspect the city moved. \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay. I can carry you. I\u2019m very strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d he said, and he did.\n\nWhen he finally had a minute to breathe, a man sidled up to him with the kind of shoes that made carpets nervous. \u201cNate,\u201d the man said\u2014his name carried on a tone that suggested he said a lot of names every day. \u201cI\u2019m Crispin. I represent sponsorship opportunities. I wanted to talk to you about\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLater,\u201d Nate said. He didn\u2019t like how his voice came out. He made it softer. \u201cSorry. Not now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Crispin said, storing the slight somewhere it could be used efficiently. \u201cWe\u2019ll make you look good. Trust me.\u201d He left a card on the table. The card felt heavy. He ignored it.\n\nIn the evening, he went to Tariq\u2019s, where the barbershop buzzed like a hive and the floor was a collage of hair colors. The chairs along the wall were full of boys who pretended to be bored and men who wished they could be. \u201cVIP!\u201d Tariq yelled, like anyone needed to be told. \u201cLadies and gentlemen: my day-one client since the dawn of time, the last man standing, the first man dancing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease cut my hair quietly,\u201d Nate said, sitting. The apron with its static clasp turned him into a person who could be sculpted. \u201cI\u2019m fragile.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a sculpture,\u201d Tariq said, and started the hum of the clippers. \u201cI saw you on the thing. I saw you look like you wanted to die and then look like you wanted to marry the camera. I have never seen anyone want to marry the camera. She is a difficult wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Nate asked, because he wanted to be kept in the world by ordinary questions.\n\n\u201cYou look like bread that has just been toasted,\u201d Tariq said. \u201cWarm. A little surprised at itself. We love to see it.\u201d He turned the chair and tilted the mirror. \u201cHey,\u201d he added, mirror and man aligned, voice lower, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you. Not everyone does the thing they say in the pub they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done it,\u201d Nate said. \u201cLike I\u2019m still on the bus and the bus hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuses don\u2019t stop if you look at them,\u201d Tariq said. \u201cLook out the window. They stop themselves. That\u2019s wisdom. I read it on the internet.\u201d\n\nNate paid and left the note he always left because haircuts were one of his luxuries and both he and Tariq pretended they weren\u2019t. He walked home through the part of Milton that looked like it had been drawn quickly and had never forgiven the hand that did it. He passed the off-licence that sold everything and nothing, the tire shop that had somehow become a rumor, the little street with the mural of a fox and a boy holding hands.\n\nHe slept again and the tunnel was a little shorter.\n\nThe next day, Dynamo bit his sleeve and tore it. He did not tear the skin beneath, which was a victory if you read it that way. \u201cMate,\u201d Nate said, \u201cwe had a talk.\u201d Dynamo stamped. The thuds were calm and angry. Nate held his ground and felt something inside him think about giving way and then decide not to. \u201cNot today,\u201d he said. The horse\u2019s breath fogged his wrist. They stared at each other, two animals with different rulebooks. Finally, Dynamo snorted and flicked his ear again like he\u2019d decided there were easier mountains to flatten. Nate let his shoulders go down and the air return to room temperature.\n\nOn his way out, he ran into Mr. Clancy, who had been around since fences were invented and had opinions about all of them. \u201cYou\u2019re the dancer,\u201d Mr. Clancy said, like he\u2019d discovered Nate by accident and was not sure he approved. \u201cDon\u2019t let the horse know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Nate said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let anybody know,\u201d Mr. Clancy added, and his laugh was a rasp of wood. \u201cExcept the whole city.\u201d\n\nNate laughed because it was easier. He waved and walked and felt like he was threading something through himself, some line that had been strung and waited. He met Maya at the hall. They refined. The lift stopped looking like a sofa and started looking like what it was, a way of telling someone you trust them without talking. Madi nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019ll do,\u201d in a voice that meant, That\u2019s starting to sparkle. Anya made a small sound that might have been a hidden applause. In the mirror, he saw himself and thought, You might be capable of this. He held the thought like a small animal.\n\nThey didn\u2019t talk about the final. It was a word they let sit in the corner. They didn\u2019t touch it in case it startled and ran. They talked about shoes. They talked about school and the radio stations that still played old songs like they were new. They talked about the weather in a way that meant other things. They talked about nothing and their bodies said everything.\n\nOnce, during a break, Maya said, \u201cMy dad wants to come to the show. He doesn\u2019t deal with crowds. He says he will deal. He says he can be softer than his fears.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood dad,\u201d Nate said.\n\n\u201cOccasionally,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy dad left when I was fifteen,\u201d he said, and the words dropped like a coin into a deep place. He didn\u2019t say them often. The story clanged. Maya looked at him and did not offer sympathy in the way people do when they like to hold their own hands up and show how empty they are. She just nodded, a tiny nod that acknowledged the existence of a scar like you acknowledge the existence of a mountain. There was relief in it\u2014no fuss. He wanted to thank her. He didn\u2019t.\n\nThey practiced until the evening came and reminded them there were dinners to eat and families to negotiate and small bathrooms to share with sisters. He went home and ate his mother\u2019s fish pie and told Lyla that emojis were something he would try but not something he trusted. He washed the plates because washing plates is a quiet that lives in the hands. He went to bed and the tunnel had lights. He slept and dreamed he was a horse in a suit, which meant nothing and meant everything.\n\nAnd every morning, the city put on its coat and went outside, and he put his body into the idea of dance, and the horses breathed fog to remind him the world still had weather, and he measured himself against both until he felt them the size he could hold. He tried to keep all the sharp good things from cutting him too soon. He counted the days without counting them, because counting made the number behave weirdly. He told himself he would remember to check the screws on the ladder if they ever gave him one again. He told himself to watch the edge of the stage where it did not care if you stepped off. He told himself don\u2019t be polite to fear. It does not repay the courtesy.\n\nOne late afternoon, the hall had been vacated except for him and the sound of his own shoes. He stayed to run the sequence once. Then once more because he had. The floor kept his secrets. He finished and saw his reflection in the high windows. He put his hand up and it did not quite reach the glass. \u201cOkay,\u201d he told it. \u201cWe begin.\u201d\n\nOutside, a horse somewhere in the fields tossed its head because the wind was wrong. In the stable, Dynamo listened to a far-off bass line and didn\u2019t like it, because Dynamo was not built to like what belonged to other animals. In the barbershop, Tariq told a story that grew and grew. In the kitchen, Janine added an extra potato to the pot without quite knowing why. In the house on the corner, Jessa put her cigarette away and, for once, didn\u2019t light another one. In a classroom, Maya pretended her attention belonged entirely to an equation. And in Nate\u2019s chest, something opened like hands.",

Tape Xs marked where cameras wanted heads and shoulders to land as if humans were polite birds. The floor didn\u2019t give; it received, and the lights, even at half, had that hospital brightness that made you feel both examined and somehow clean. Nate followed a production assistant with a torch and a headset who said everything twice in a whisper, the only kind of whisper stage people respected. He stood where he was told and then moved six inches left because a man with a lanyard pointed a finger like a precise storm and said, \u201cLeft.\u201d Maya stood next to him and rocked on her heels, her mouth making shapes at the rigging like she was learning a new alphabet.\n\nCamera blocking was a misnamed ritual; nobody wanted to block anybody. They wanted flow that could be predicted. Madi walked them through the frame lines, her voice a metronome with opinions. \u201cThis lens loves your hips, Nate, not your knees, so don\u2019t hide in your knees. Maya, if you cut downstage there, the jib will love you and I want that for you because we need their love or they throw us off the internet. Pause here a half beat longer. Don\u2019t sigh; I can hear sighs at fifty metres. Smile at thirty, not at ten.\u201d They did it, then did it again, then did it with a pretend audience so Madi could measure their breathing. The floor had a seam that would catch someone not concentrating. Nate found it with the toe of his shoe, memorized it with the kind of care he usually reserved for people.\n\nThey left with the good tired that came from learning the rules of a room. By the time they got to the hallway the producer swarm had scented them, the way bees know when a boy has sugar in his pockets. Crispin had his shoes and his smile and the precise way he pitched his voice so it would travel without sounding like it travelled. \u201cThere he is,\u201d he said, as if the morning had been an elaborate game of hide and seek and he had just won. \u201cStud, my man. Wonderful. Wonderful shape the pair of you are making. Honest. Authentic. We love it. Quick one about a segment idea for the stream\u2014tiny little thing, won\u2019t take up your day. We want to put you with your horses. A little B-roll, a little content. You\u2019ll show us the stables, talk about discipline, about grounding, about how mucking out makes you the man you are. It cuts great with your, you know.\u201d He fluttered a hand in a shape that meant story.\n\nMaya had a look for fake niceness; it was almost respectful. She put it on now and let Crispin talk. Nate tried to answer with his skin, which had gone on alert. \u201cThey\u2019re not my horses,\u201d he said, because he wanted the sentence out in the air where it could protect them. \u201cThey belong to the yard. I work there. The boss is funny about cameras.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Crispin said, hearing all the words and none of the meaning. \u201cWe adore funny bosses. There\u2019s a universal quality to a funny boss. We can work it. We\u2019re not talking reality nonsense. We do this with taste. We do you justice. You\u2019ll sign a release. He\u2019ll sign a release. The public wants grit with its glitter. You\u2019ve got both. Come on, we\u2019ll make it painless.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there going to be big silver plates that flash light at things?\u201d Maya asked, tilting her head so the plaits made a question mark. \u201cBecause if you bring those to a horse, the horse brings a lawsuit to your face.\u201d\n\nCrispin did the laugh successful men do when they want you to think they\u2019ve got farm experience. \u201cWe know animals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very gentle. Tomorrow morning? Half an hour. Fifteen. Ten. You won\u2019t even know we were there.\u201d\n\nNate rubbed his palms on his jeans and found a word that had saved him more than once. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, and then, because no alone felt like a door he hadn\u2019t earned, he added, \u201cNot unless I ask my boss. And we\u2019d need quiet. And we\u2019ll keep to Lovey. Dynamo doesn\u2019t like\u2026 anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLovey,\u201d Crispin repeated, tasting a brand, and filed the name where captions are born. \u201cAsk the boss. Tell him national exposure. Tell him no cost. Tell him we\u2019ll pixelate his moles.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell him that,\u201d Maya said, grinning at the ceiling for dramatic effect. \u201cTell him we\u2019ll be fast and we won\u2019t point at the hay and say \u2018look, it\u2019s wheat.\u2019 He\u2019ll hate that.\u201d\n\nThey found a corner without voices and Madi leaned in, her blade-smile tucked away for the moment. \u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked, which sounded so small and sensible it was almost like being handed a clean glass of water.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them to make it a circus,\u201d Nate said. He was learning that some words, like circus, meant two opposite things at once. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet at the yard. People there don\u2019t like to be looked at with the lights on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we won\u2019t make it a circus,\u201d Madi said, and there was relief in the plainness of it. \u201cSay what you need out loud to the person who thinks they need the content. They\u2019ll still try for the content. That\u2019s their job. Our job is to do ours and put a hand up when it matters. Put your hand up.\u201d\n\nHe called Janine on the walk to the bus, told her the idea and the pit in his stomach, and listened to her slice onions carefully so she wouldn\u2019t cry for the wrong reasons. \u201cSay no,\u201d she said, after a pause where you could hear her decide, like a coin landing on a side. \u201cOr say yes if saying yes gets you something you actually want. If they want you to be a boy who lives in the mud because it fits in a nice box, let them stand in the mud for as long as you had to. I am not mopping under their shoes.\u201d\n\nAt the yard the next morning, the frost had given up being pretty and turned into something with a crunch. Mr. Clancy squinted at the van when it pulled in and squinted harder at the people who climbed out. The cameraman wore a beanie and expensive boots that wanted to be in a different postcode. The sound woman detached a little furry microphone from a case with reverence, as if it were a rescued animal. The runner was nineteen in a body that would always be nineteen. Crispin had dressed down in a jumper whose label said dressed up. \u201cHe looks like a cardigan advert,\u201d Jessa murmured out of the side of her mouth; she\u2019d come despite the hour, because if something went wrong she liked to be there to say told you so and help tidy it up anyway. \u201cIf he gets kicked I will remain neutral externally.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t get anyone kicked,\u201d Nate said to the air, and to Dynamo in particular. He presented Lovey like an old friend. She extended her long nose and breathed onto the microphone with interest, then sneezed wetly and endearingly. Maya arrived five minutes later, scarf to her nose, eyes bright with mischief that could be turned off like a switch. \u201cI have ten minutes,\u201d she said, \u201cthen physics, then regret. Where do you want my charm?\u201d\n\nThey set up by the fence, which had good angles and a background of honest field. Nate explained feed buckets and how you hang a hay net so a horse can eat but not get its feet in it, and he tried not to look like he knew the camera was close enough to count his pores. He let Lovey sniff his shoulder and made sure his hands were slow and visible. Maya, obediently at the edge of frame, laughed at something he said under his breath about the way the cows filed formal complaints about her scarf when she\u2019d come last, and her laugh made the cameraman pull focus in her direction instinctively like a man turning his head when he hears a song from childhood.\n\n\u201cCan we get you by the big lad?\u201d Crispin asked, restless for more drama. He didn\u2019t say Dynamo\u2019s name like a person would. He said it like a recipe required it.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Nate said. He put the word on the fence where it could be seen, not tossed quietly into the grass to be stepped on later. \u201cWe\u2019re staying here. Lovey or the field or the yard dog if she decides to bless us. No Dynamo. He hates anything new and this is very new.\u201d\n\nCrispin did the palms-up thing that meant compromise but was actually persuasion with better manners. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep our distance. Just one pass. A touch of stroking. The public love a big horse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen show them a bus,\u201d Jessa said behind him, admirable in her commitment to heckling as an art form. \u201cIt\u2019s like a horse but you can wave at it without losing a finger.\u201d\n\nThe runner, whose nervous energy was a separate character on set, edged toward the second stall because youth makes you brave where experience makes you grateful. Nate saw the angle of it\u2014the open gate, the wrong body in the wrong sightline. Dynamo saw it too. He huffed and did that small freeze that came before the big movement, like lightning deciding what tree it wants. \u201cBack,\u201d Nate said, already moving, his voice low and the hand out, not to touch, but to make the space make sense again. \u201cBack. Hey. Back.\u201d The runner stopped at the tone, eyes wide, a deer who\u2019d wandered into a classroom. Dynamo lifted, not the full rear, but the combined vexation of a beast that had forgotten how to trust but remembered how to argue. The reflector, which had been idle like a quiet moon, flashed as someone shifted, and that was all it took to turn argument into action.\n\nNate stepped between. He didn\u2019t touch the horse yet; he bent his posture in that human bow that says I see you and I\u2019m going to make myself smaller, and he spoke the sounds he saved for this exact wrongness. His hands made a shape Maya recognised from rehearsals, the shape he made around a lift when he wanted to tell your weight it was safe. The runner backed up until her back met the wall and she realised walls could love you. Dynamo\u2019s foreleg stamped and found nothing to crush, and the noise of it cracked open the morning. Lovey in the next stall looked up, ears like pennants. Crispin did what men do who aren\u2019t sure what to do; he straightened his coat and then remembered not to reach for a shoulder. The cameraman lowered his camera in a gesture the universe should have rewarded.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Nate said again, and he laid his hand against Dynamo\u2019s neck when neck and hand agreed. He felt the tremor that ran like lightning seeking ground. \u201cOkay. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s all stupid. It\u2019s fine. My man. It\u2019s fine.\u201d He breathed how you want someone else to breathe. The ears flicked. The weight shifted back, and you could feel fifty angry kilos decide not to take revenge on anyone. He stood like a mountain being remembered by the people who named it. Nate let his shoulder drop and his eyes go soft and the flood that had entered his chest be turned back by the good gates you build with practice.\n\nMaya, who had not moved except to hold still like someone very much alive learning about stillness, made the face she made when a difficult sequence landed. \u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered, not for the horse, but for the cameras and the boy. \u201cOkay, okay. I take back everything bad I ever said about hay.\u201d\n\nCrispin\u2019s voice came out flatter than usual, the world having pried something slick off it. \u201cWe\u2019ll cut there,\u201d he said, and for once he meant it. \u201cWe have enough. Thank you. Thank you. We\u2019ll be out of your way.\u201d\n\nThe runner apologised six times. Mr. Clancy materialised to deliver judgement on the wind and everyone born in months with the letter R. \u201cHe told you,\u201d he said, not unkindly, to the crew. \u201cHe told you no. When a man says a thing and he knows it, it\u2019s best to stand a little behind the thing, not in front of it.\u201d\n\nAfter they left, the yard returned to its frequency. The dogs resumed their investigation of smells as if the world\u2019s secrets were not held in contracts but in nettles. Nate leaned on the fence and laughed like someone who had carried a weight for a mile and found it lighter at the end than it had been at the start. Maya climbed the gate and sat on the top rung, legs swinging, the picture of a girl who had learned the shape of bravery before someone drew it for her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to be scared later,\u201d she said eventually. \u201cYou used up your quota. That was terrifying. Don\u2019t do it again unless I have snacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will pre-schedule all terror,\u201d he said, wiping mud off his sleeve in a way that just redistributed it. \u201cYou going to be late to physics?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said, cheerful in defeat. \u201cI will tell sir I learned about forces anyway.\u201d She pointed at Dynamo, who was pretending he had never been dramatic a day in his life. \u201cNewton, but with opinions.\u201d She dropped down and wiped her hands on her trousers. \u201cCan I\u2014\u201d She stopped, fingers hovering. \u201cIf I\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cLovey will tolerate flattery from strangers,\u201d Nate said. \u201cDynamo will write to his MP.\u201d He led her to the skewbald, who let Maya\u2019s palm settle on the slope of her cheek like a carefully placed coin. Maya sneezed as predicted, looking betrayed and delighted at the same time. \u201cThis is my punishment for being a city child,\u201d she said, which made him laugh.\n\nAfter, she walked him to the bus, and they took the six benches between the gate and the road slow, like a ceremony. She told him she had a mock next week that would decide which part of the exam her teacher would sigh at. He told her his mother had a meeting with someone at the council about a letter without detail that had come in a brown envelope. They agreed that brown envelopes had done something to them both long ago that made the blood in your face walk out for a minute.\n\nAt home, the brown envelope had been tamed into a neat pile at the far edge of the table, like it had been told to think about what it had done. Janine was making something with onions, beans and an optimism that had never yet betrayed her. She didn\u2019t hover the way some mothers hovered when their boys came back from being watched. She did watch him without looking like she was watching, which is a different skill. \u201cHow was the horse,\u201d she asked, in the singular.\n\n\u201cPersuasive,\u201d he said, which made her mouth do the small uprights at the corners that said the day had not beaten her. \u201cThey won\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cThe house doesn\u2019t need to be on the telly to be real.\u201d She gestured at the pile with her chin. \u201cIt\u2019s just a thing about the rent going up. Everyone who owns anything wants to own more. It will be fine until it isn\u2019t. We\u2019ll think about it if it\u2019s not fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t pay a rise without thinking about it,\u201d he said, and she looked at him straight, which meant she had decided to tell one more truth than was strictly necessary.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBut your name isn\u2019t money yet. We\u2019ll take your name being yours before we make it work for anyone else.\u201d She went back to the pan. \u201cI\u2019ll ring Mrs. Khanna and ask about her nephew who knows about these things. He will say things about indexes and we will nod and then try not to cry when we have to do sums. Eat a biscuit before you talk to fear about money. It makes you brave.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to hand her Crispin\u2019s card and say, I could do a thing and they might put our faces next to trainers and pay me enough for three months of not worrying, but he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t know yet if that would be selling something that would cost more later than it bought now. Instead he said, \u201cI\u2019ll make the mugs,\u201d and he did, bringing her the chipped one with the bird on it that claimed it was indestructible.\n\nLyla arrived with three unsafe ideas and a glue gun. She had stolen poster board from school or repurposed a project so cleverly you could call it a theft if you wanted. \u201cWe are making signage,\u201d she said, like a general addressing a volunteer army. \u201cWe are making banners. We are making a plan for what I will wear when I am interviewed as your sister and I become my own entity. Mum, do we have glitter, and if we do not, why have you raised me in this denial.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have paprika,\u201d Janine said, handing her the jar with the seriousness paprika deserves. \u201cYou can pretend it is glitter and then burn your tongue. There is marmalade. That is sticky and festive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate marmalade,\u201d Lyla announced, so loudly that two houses down a man wondered briefly if he was missing a joke. \u201cAlso, I did my speech for English. It is about ambition. Spoiler: it is a trap and a ladder.\u201d She looked at Nate, her face doing the brand of cheek that came from having grown up in the same house as him. \u201cYou are mentioned three times. You owe me a footnote in your autobiography. I will accept payment in hoodies.\u201d\n\nThey worked at the table, domesticity making its case. He cut and she stuck and Janine rationed biscuits like she was handing out medals. The radio did that thing where it put on a song that made you remember a bus stop in Year Eleven and the smell of someone's perfume you thought at the time was proof that life had secret rooms. He let himself fall into the ordinary and could feel his body thank him for it.\n\nThe next day Maya was brittle in a way that took a minute to name. It wasn\u2019t anger. It was the kind of edge that shows up when you\u2019ve had to make your brain perform for strangers with clipboards. \u201cI did okay in the mock,\u201d she said, stretching like she could shake the graded paper out of her muscles. \u201cWhich feels like failing even when they tell you it\u2019s not. Dad said if I can do that I can do better, which is technically true and useless.\u201d\n\nAnya was quieter with her sharpness than usual, which told you she\u2019d chosen kindness as an experiment to see if it suited her. Madi came in with an energy that suggested she\u2019d wrestled a printer and won. \u201cWe edit,\u201d she said, dropping her bag and clapping once in a way that made people in three other rooms straighten their backs. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a little flourish in count five that reads polite. I don\u2019t love polite there. Bring me the thing under polite.\u201d They built the lift again from the floor up as if truth had to be set into muscle slowly. Nate\u2019s knee did a whisper, a little complaint like wood, and he told it to hold its counsel. Maya\u2019s left foot decided it didn\u2019t like the floor. Anya raised an eyebrow at the foot and the foot chose different priorities.\n\nThey argued once, properly, not the flirty kind of bicker that tastes sweet. It was about tempo, which is to say it was about control. Maya wanted to push, to ride the music like a wave you didn\u2019t respect. Nate wanted to place, to know where the board was before he stepped. \u201cYou\u2019re holding me,\u201d she said, breath fast, eyes bright. \u201cIf you hold me at your rhythm then I have to be you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I let it go faster I lose you,\u201d he said, feeling the old habit of repeating to make safety arrive. \u201cI can\u2019t catch you if I don\u2019t know where my feet are.\u201d\n\nThey practised it until both of them were wrong and then a little right. Madi stopped them when their annoyance began to bleed into their shapes. \u201cListen,\u201d she said, and they listened because she had that teacher voice that teaches even when it jokes. \u201cYou\u2019re both trying to keep the other safe in your favourite language. Switch languages. For eight counts you do it her way, Nate. Trust that your feet are not stupid. For eight counts you do it his way, Maya. Let the floor be a partner you aren\u2019t trying to seduce. Then you do it together. You\u2019re both right. Congratulations. It\u2019s boring to be both right.\u201d\n\nThey did what she said because boredom, in that room, was the worst insult available. It worked enough to give them a new argument later and a laugh now. Maya pinched the bridge of her nose like a pensioner and sighed. \u201cThis is gross,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I like it.\u201d\n\nOn the way out of the building, after a day that felt like three, Nate\u2019s phone vibrated itself anxious in his pocket. He looked and saw an unfamiliar number with a city code that made his mouth taste like coins. He could have ignored it. He could have let it fall into that place where calls go when you aren\u2019t ready. He pressed accept because he was tired of cupboard doors half open in his head.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said. There was a pause where a hundred versions of a man\u2019s voice arranged themselves and then chose one.\n\n\u201cNathan,\u201d the voice said, clipped, careful, as if the speaker had been sat on all day by life and had only now stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s your father. I saw you.\u201d There was a sound after saw that wasn\u2019t on the call, a sound like a chair scraping. \u201cOn the internet. Your\u2014dance.\u201d The word came out heavy with someone else\u2019s idea of it glued to it. \u201cYou were\u2026 very good.\u201d\n\nNate stopped in the doorway and felt the world decide how loudly it would continue. Maya had gone ahead, then realised he was a still shape and came back, standing a little distance away like a lighthouse that minded its own business. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, because there were a hundred words and he owned none of them. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I should ring,\u201d his father said. He was making a sentence in an unfamiliar language. \u201cTo say\u2014well done. And your mother\u2026 I might\u2026 I will send something. Money. If you need it. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d He cleared his throat, the international sign for a man not used to it. \u201cIt\u2019s good, Nathan. It suits you.\u201d\n\nThere were a thousand things to say that would make the air crack. He could pick none and still be honest. \u201cI have to go to rehearsal,\u201d he said, because he did not and could not explain that rehearsal was the place he had built for this exact moment. \u201cThanks for ringing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d his father said, just like that, the old word wrapping around the new call. \u201cAll right, son.\u201d He hung up clumsily, like people did on films when they had been told to hurry. The silence after him was not actually silent. It was a new sound. It took a second to learn whether it was a noise that meant danger, or weather.\n\nMaya nudged his elbow with hers in a way that only someone who\u2019s watched you find your way out of a different kind of hard thing is allowed to. \u201cOkay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, and a man walking past them with a sandwich laughed at something on his own phone, and the normality of it made the hall less bright. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine like okay or fine like I will be fine later but at the moment my skin is wearing me,\u201d she said, and he barked that laugh that comes when someone calls your shape what it is without drawing a circle around it.\n\nHe went home with a head full of sentences he had not said. He put his phone down on the table and looked at it like it was an animal he was training. Janine squeezed his shoulder as she passed him and set another potato going without discussion. That night, after all the people had put themselves in their rooms and declared their day done, he sat in the little patch of safety between sleep and worry and answered a message from Jessa on his own terms. She had sent a photo of the gate at the allotments and captioned it with a weather report that included opinions. He sent her a picture of the stage with no lights on and wrote, pocket city. She replied, pocket volcano, and that was exactly it.\n\nThe dress rehearsal brought the city into the room whether it wanted to be there or not. There were clipboards for the clipboards, runners with headsets who ran out of reasons to run, a man who only talked into a radio and never stopped mid-word. Security pinned badges to shirts as if they could pin time. They were asked not to spill water, not to spill secrets, not to spill themselves. The floor had been cleaned to the point of being an argument. The air had that quality of before. They ran the piece in costume, which meant Nate\u2019s good jacket and the trousers that had cost more than he\u2019d told anyone and Maya in a black set that managed the trick of being serious and impossible to ignore.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fall,\u201d Maya said, tying her laces the way only a person with younger knees can, with faith and speed. \u201cIt\u2019s bad television. Also bad everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will fall into being a responsible adult,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is worse.\u201d\n\nThey stepped into the light and let it find the sides of them it wanted to outline. The first notes were there, and Nate\u2019s hand found the space between Maya\u2019s shoulder and the air and held that space until it felt like warmth. The floor seam he\u2019d worried about was exactly where his body remembered it would be. He did the count her way and then his way and then their way. He did the lift with the breath and the trust and the minute flick of her eyes that said, yes now. He didn\u2019t look at the edge because he knew where it was. He didn\u2019t look at the cameras because the cameras, when you were doing it right, were just other animals in the field. Midway through the run he felt the small click Madi had wanted, the one that says the parts are talking to each other without requiring a meeting.\n\nThey finished on the last beat as if they had placed it there the day before and asked it politely to wait for them. There was no applause because this wasn\u2019t that kind of day. There was the noise of a room resettling into its function and a breath that belonged to both of them and a look from Madi that wasn\u2019t a blade and wasn\u2019t a shield, just a look that said this is a thing. Anya\u2019s bun had a hair out of it, which told you she had allowed human feeling to creep through all that efficiency just then and forgotten to fix it.\n\nBackstage, an assistant with a headset pointed them at a wall where names were listed with arrows. Nate saw his own and underneath it, in a hand that was not his, someone had written Stud in little neat letters and drawn a heart and crossed it out and then drawn a horse and left it. He laughed, and it was easier than before. He sat on a plastic chair while Maya was snatched for a lighting tweak and stretched his knees with the kind of care you give to bridges. He was an animal, and the stage was weather, and the city outside had put its coat on and would take it off when the lights were done.\n\nOn the way home he shared a carriage with a man in a fox costume who looked tired in the eyes and a woman holding three foil balloons that, despite her best efforts, had opinions about physics. Nate texted Lyla that her poster glitter had ended up on his trousers like a blessing from a god with poor aim. She sent him a picture of herself with two banners and a dog she had borrowed for the purpose of showing scale. He sent Tariq a video of the light rig doing its slow dance above an empty stage and typed, wife is in a good mood, and Tariq sent back, treat her right, she is high maintenance.\n\nHe got off two stops early again and walked by the river where the light was thinking about leaving. Two kids drew on the frost with their fingers and then looked guilty at the marks, as if they had cut the skin of something alive. The field smelled like cold and soil. At the fence near the far paddock he could just make out Dynamo, a big dark certainty. He lifted a hand and felt foolish and felt fine feeling foolish. \u201cWe begin,\u201d he said, not at the horse, not at the field, not at himself. He said it to the space that had grown in his chest since the email made him stop in the lane. He said it to the column of air between the stage and the kitchen. He said it to whatever in him had stayed quiet for so long to make room for other people\u2019s noises. He didn\u2019t get an answer, which felt right. He put his hands in his pockets and went home in the kind of silence that doesn\u2019t bite.",

Nate woke before the alarm, the kind of alert you get when your body has set its own clock out of stubbornness and a little love. He lay very still and checked inside himself for the noise that had been building all week. It was there, but it had rounded its edges and settled lower, closer to where his lungs did their work, as if it had decided to be useful. He put his feet on the cold floor and exhaled, counting without counting. From the kitchen came the sound of Janine finding bowls with the authority of a woman who had never once asked a cupboard\u2019s permission.\n\nHe found her at the table making poached eggs in the old metal saucepan that hated to cooperate. She had her hair tied back with a ribbon that had lost its right to be called ribbon but refused to retire. \u201cYou have a face on,\u201d she said, not looking up because mothers can see you with the wrong part of their heads. \u201cIs it the face for the big day or the face for pretending it\u2019s just Thursday?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a face that would like eggs,\u201d he said, and sat, and let his hands sit obediently on the wood because it grounded him to have them do as they were told. Lyla came in like weather, an event in a hooded top that had declared war on quiet. She was already wearing her banner like a sash and had glitter in her eyelashes that made her blink like a lighthouse.\n\n\u201cAre you going to be sick?\u201d she asked with the cheerfulness of the truly supportive. \u201cIf you are going to be sick, do it in the sink because the bathroom is a crime scene.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not going to be sick,\u201d he said, and discovered he meant it. \u201cIf I am going to be sick, I will do it on Crispin\u2019s shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do not do it on anyone\u2019s shoes,\u201d Janine said, and plated an egg with the ceremony of a due acknowledgement. \u201cEat. Then breathe. Then call Jessa and remind her that she cannot yell at security. Then go and be brilliant. We will follow like sensible shadows.\u201d\n\nThe bus today held himself and four teenagers who looked at the world in the way people look at a buffet when they\u2019re not sure whether it\u2019s polite to be hungry. Milton did its Milton thing outside the window, pragmatic and hopeful in the same breath. He could see the Centre from far off, the big curve of glass and the thin letters on poles that had been designed by someone who believed in fonts. The city had put on clean clothes; he could tell from the way people were walking faster.\n\nAt the stables, the frost had turned to slick silver in the places the sun hadn\u2019t reached. He took the long path around to give his brain something ordinary to do and found Mr. Clancy checking a gate like the gate had offended his family. \u201cBig day,\u201d Mr. Clancy said, and that was generous for him. \u201cDon\u2019t fall off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep my feet,\u201d Nate said, and ran a hand down Lovey\u2019s neck because she let him share nerves with her without taking any for herself. Dynamo snorted from his stall like he was making fun of anyone who would leave their house to be watched. Nate leaned on the half-door and looked in anyway, respecting the line between courage and foolishness. \u201cI won\u2019t bring any cameras,\u201d he said, which felt like a promise and sounded like diplomacy. Dynamo flicked an ear toward him and returned to pretending hay was a grievance.\n\nMaya texted from the top deck of her own bus a picture of her trainers and a caption that said, these shoes refuse mediocrity. He replied with a picture of his knee wrapped in the kind of elastic that suggested it had opinions about everything and wrote, this knee will be polite. She wrote back a string of small gold trophies and a bowl of soup for reasons neither of them could remember.\n\nThe stage at the Centre had grown a kiss of light overnight and looked like somewhere important and unforgiving. The crew had multiplied, and you could tell who belonged to which department by the way they moved. Sound people always looked like they were listening to something no one else could hear. Lighting people gazed upward as if God had left notes in the rigging. Production assistants went everywhere at once and somehow also nowhere in particular. Anya stood just inside the wings like a chaperone who had promised to let the children make their own mistakes unless those mistakes involved tripping in front of strangers. Madi was on the edge of the stage with her clipboard and her soft blade-smile and a thermos that probably contained something decent.\n\n\u201cMorning, joy merchants,\u201d Madi said when they came into her radius. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the cue-to-cue again because everyone is pretending yesterday didn\u2019t happen and then we\u2019ll leave you alone to be good at your jobs. Nate, the jib will make a pass that feels like a new moon. Don\u2019t look at it like it owes you money. Maya, your hair is doing a thing the camera hates, so either make it do a different thing or we won\u2019t look at your head, which would be a waste.\u201d\n\nMaya extracted a bobble and reworked her plaits with the efficiency of a girl who had been explaining herself to mirrors since she could reach them. \u201cI had a dream I was late,\u201d she said to nobody in particular. \u201cIn the dream I was late and no one minded because we were all underwater. Then I woke up and remembered about punctuality and oxygen, and I couldn\u2019t go back to sleep because both seemed suddenly tyrannical.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be on time and you\u2019ll breathe,\u201d Anya said from her post, and lifted a hand an inch, a blessing and a threat. \u201cYour left foot is already trying to rebel. Tell it to sit down.\u201d Maya wiggled her left toes and then stamped because obedience sometimes needed theatre.\n\nThey ran the beginning and the middle and the end and then they ran the bits in between. The lights did that slow roll that made the stage feel like a breathing thing. Nate learned the camera\u2019s path in the way you learn a dog\u2019s intentions, by watching the places it looked at when it thought no one was paying attention. He could feel his body find familiar routes. The seam was where he had left it. The breath was where Madi had requested it. The lift came and went without complaint, not like a secret, but like a sentence that knows its own grammar.\n\nIn the green room that had been christened green because no one had the heart to call it fluorescent, someone had laid out fruit and pastries and a humiliation of tiny bottles of water that tried too hard. Performers did their rituals: some talked, some slept, some stretched one hamstring on the back of a chair in a way that made health and safety inspectors dream of retirement. A boy with the silver hoodie from the first day had a portable speaker and a face that said he was negotiating the playlist with God. He nodded at Nate like conspirators. A woman with the red dress had pinned nothing to the corkboard and looked content about it. Maya ate a banana and then a second banana and then announced that two bananas were the exact right amount and any banana beyond the second banana was hubris.\n\nCrispin did a loop of the room that felt like a security check for emotions and paused by their corner with the very particular delight of a man who could smell a moment he could sell if he pressed at the edges. \u201cBig night,\u201d he said, his voice pitched to perform intimacy in a publicly acceptable register. \u201cVery proud of the piece. Very us. A little note about post-show opportunities. It will be mad; we\u2019ll want content in the corridor, maybe at the fountain if we can steal a minute, a little raw thing for the stream. Give me two shots of your faces right after you come off. I promise not to ask for tears. If tears happen naturally, we don\u2019t argue with nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dancing,\u201d Maya said, and her smile was weaponised. \u201cEverything else is a queue. You can take our faces after we\u2019re finished using them.\u201d Crispin applauded the line like he intended to put it on a T-shirt. When he moved on, Madi drifted in like a very polite storm and stood between them and whatever was next because that was part of her job too.\n\nJanine texted a picture from the plaza where sunlight made a brief and necessary attempt to improve the concrete. She had Tariq and Jessa on either side of her like a pair of mismatched bodyguards and Lyla in front with a banner so large it had required three buses to explain it. The sign read GO ON THEN, STUD in letters so confident they were almost arrogant, and beneath that LYLA\u2019S BROTHER, CALL ME IF YOU ARE A TALENT SCOUT, with a number that probably belonged to a pizza place. Nate laughed the sort of laugh that comes when love gets the spelling wrong and still arrives on time. He texted back a heart and then a horse and then corrected the horse because the first horse looked like it might sue.\n\nThe house filled itself with the steady discipline of people who had paid for their tickets and wanted them to work. You could hear the audience in the walls, the sound that isn\u2019t sound exactly but a pressure, a waiting. Backstage, the queue reshuffled as cues always do and they were pushed ten minutes and then pulled five, the elastic time of theatre. A runner with a headset and the kind of concentration usually reserved for bomb disposal knocked on their door with the knuckles of someone trying not to disturb ghosts. \u201cFive to you,\u201d she said, and smiled so quickly it almost didn\u2019t count, and they stood.\n\nIn the wings, the stage looked more like a river than it had before, a strip of brightness you could step into if you agreed to get wet. Nate could smell hairspray, dust, and the cheap apple scented cleaner they used on the railings. He could feel Maya\u2019s shoulder close to his arm, the familiar geometry that had been earned in a week and felt like something older. Anya, who had sworn she did not believe in touching before performances, put one hand on each of their backs like a bridge and leaned her forehead for half a breath against the cool metal of the fly system. Madi counted them off without moving her mouth. The opening bars slipped in under the curtain like a late guest.\n\nThey went. There was the bright of it and the blank of it and the calm inside the bright that felt like snow, the good kind that teaches the world to hush. They did the small things first because small things make big things possible. He placed his weight and then took it back and then let it go and did not ask permission again. She sliced and he caught; he rolled and she pressed; she made gravity jealous and he forgave it. On three-and-four he felt her elbow say now in a language the bones speak. On five he gave up the bit of control he had been hoarding for emergencies. On seven he found it again but it had changed shape and he liked the new one better. The air on the stage has temperature and he could feel it adjust to them, get warmer where they wrote their names into it.\n\nThere were notes, the ones that had been notes for days and the ones that arrived and left like birds, and for once he didn\u2019t resent them. The seam on the floor tried to argue and he declined the argument. The phrase they had fought about did what phrases do when they are finally trusted: it held. The lift came and for a blink the world giggled in panic because she was not quite where the rehearsal had promised she would be and he was not quite where his knee intended, but then her hand met his wrist and his palm found the top of her shoulder and they changed the count by a hair and the new count was a doorway they could pass through without lying. It was the kind of error that makes the rest true. He felt Anya\u2019s distant approving frown and Madi\u2019s soft exhale without having to see them.\n\nThe last eight counts were the ones they had told nobody about in case they went wrong. They had stolen a tiny piece of quiet and dropped it into the choreography like a coin into a well. The music peeled back and they were left with the sound of shoe on floor and the breath that belongs to two people when two people are doing a thing exactly together on purpose. The air held its shoulders high. He put his hand out and she stepped into it and their heads turned at the same time to two different points in the room and you could feel the audience\u2019s collective neck move with them like obedient birds. Then the last beat, which is never the last beat, and blackout that wasn\u2019t full because the emergency lights were doing their duty, and the small noise a big room makes when it has decided it is safe to tell the truth.\n\nThe applause wasn\u2019t thunder. It was rain on a roof, grateful and accumulating, the kind that arrives from a lot of people deciding yes at once. He received it like he\u2019d been told to hold a baby for the first time. He could hear Lyla in the top corner where the banner had been a menace and Janine\u2019s particular clap which carried straight back to his years and Tariq\u2019s whistle that started with a vowel you couldn\u2019t write down. He would have sworn he heard Mr. Clancy, but he knew that was impossible; some sounds just carry themselves back to you when you need them.\n\nBackstage was a well-lit chaos with hugs and the sort of congratulations that contain the words for your name even when they don\u2019t use them. Madi squeezed his shoulder and the blade-smile retired for a minute. \u201cYou didn\u2019t apologise to the floor,\u201d she said, which in her language was a medal. \u201cThat was adult of you. Keep it up.\u201d\n\nAnya looked like a person who had taken off a small piece of armour without ceremony and then decided she did not want it back immediately. \u201cYour left foot,\u201d she said to Maya, because she had a reputation to maintain, and then added, \u201cHe is good for you.\u201d She looked at Nate for one second longer than the rules permitted and nodded. \u201cYou may tell your mother I said that and that she is allowed to be smug.\u201d\n\nCrispin appeared like a spare note and for once asked for nothing more than the faces he had promised himself. He got a quick frame of them both with the red of effort in their cheeks and put the camera away like a man respectful at a funeral. \u201cThat was delicious,\u201d he said, holding his hands an inch apart like he was describing a small cake. \u201cI can sell this all day, but I won\u2019t until you\u2019ve eaten something that isn\u2019t a banana.\u201d\n\nThey ate whatever the green room offered that wasn\u2019t dignified, the good indignity of food with the soul of a petrol station. Other dancers came by to hit them lightly on the arms in the way you do when you know someone will bruise the next day and you want to be a part of it. The boy in the silver hoodie taught Lyla a three-count move in the corridor while security looked the other way because sometimes kindness was part of the job. A producer with a spreadsheet the size of Milton told Maya she had done the city proud. Maya said the city had done itself proud and then had to sit because pride is heavy if you don\u2019t distribute it evenly.\n\nThey were finally released into the foyer where the public had been invited to behave like they\u2019d just seen someone do a thing worth talking about. Janine barrelled toward him with that particular combination of dignity and haste mothers possess when they are proud and don\u2019t want to embarrass themselves doing it. She started to say your and then switched to you and then found nothing and did the practical thing of putting both her hands on his cheeks and expanding her smile into a room with which she had not negotiated at all. \u201cYou were beautiful,\u201d she said, and the word landed like a truth you can stand on. \u201cYou were yourself.\u201d\n\nLyla flung herself around his waist and said his name fifteen times because her mouth needed practice at belonging to the moment. Tariq, who had already told seven people in the foyer a version of the story in which he had discovered Nate in a skip and polished him until he shone, hugged him and whispered in his ear, \u201cShe said yes,\u201d as if the city itself had proposed. Jessa stood at the edge of the group, her hands in her pockets, her cigarette deliberately absent. She raised her chin and he saw her eyes do the soft thing they only did when she\u2019d forgotten to be difficult. \u201cAcceptable,\u201d she said, which meant she had moved her own furniture around to make room for pride.\n\nHe was turning toward Maya to say the thing that would help them pin this to the day when a voice he knew at the edges and not quite in the middle said his name like a word it had decided to pronounce properly. He looked and there was his father, not quite in the light, carrying his hands the way men carry tools when they don\u2019t want to admit they missed them. He had shaved with poor confidence. He wore a jacket that was doing its best. He had a stiff bouquet that had been bought from a supermarket that had arranged flowers under a fluorescent ambition. Behind him, as if the city were helping with stagecraft, the automatic doors opened and sent a gust of warm air and perfume into the space between them.\n\n\u201cNathan,\u201d his father said again, softer, because the first had been a rehearsal. \u201cThat was\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen you do\u2026 that.\u201d He gestured toward the stage with the bouquet and one of the lilies, unsure of its own strength, abandoned the group and fell to the floor with the sort of tragic grace only flowers can manage. No one reached for it. It seemed right to let it rest.\n\nJanine\u2019s face went neutral in that very particular way of women who have promised themselves a certain standard of self-respect in public. She stood a fraction to the side, not shielding, not offering, simply holding the air equal between two people and waiting to see if the gravity changed. Lyla\u2019s eyes went large and clever and she stepped backwards into Tariq, who put a hand on the top of her head without thinking about it and then pretended he had been planning that gesture for weeks.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming,\u201d Nate said, and he heard his own voice and approved of its plainness. He was surprised to find that none of the old weather came scudding over the horizon at the sight of the man; the stage had rearranged his climate. \u201cWe don\u2019t\u2026 we don\u2019t have a lot of spare chairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stood,\u201d his father said, and the humour he tried on did not rest naturally on him but did not embarrass either of them. \u201cI rang and then I thought, it\u2019s no good ringing and not doing. So I did. I got\u2026 lost.\u201d He grimaced at the word like an admission. He looked at Janine very briefly, and when their eyes met they both nodded like people who have negotiated peace in a war neither wants to revisit. \u201cYou were very good,\u201d he added, turning back. \u201cI brought\u2026 these.\u201d He held the bouquet out like a licence he hoped would be accepted. The cellophane crinkled with the sound of a thousand small apologies. Janine took the flowers without commentary and handed them to Lyla, who took them in the sullen exalted way teenagers take responsibility when they sense danger and also an opportunity to be superior.\n\n\u201cThis is Maya,\u201d Nate said, because he could not think of anything else to say and introducing someone brilliant felt like a good old custom to rely on. \u201cMy partner. Maya, this is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father,\u201d she finished, stepping in, her hand quick and neat. \u201cHi. The dance was a two-person project. He was not entirely responsible.\u201d She grinned just enough to make the words warm. \u201cI\u2019m very strong.\u201d\n\nHis father shook her hand and looked as if he were calibrating a new machine. \u201cYou\u2019re very good,\u201d he said, and the accuracy of it was a gift to all of them. \u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2026 do that. My knees.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy knees are teenagers,\u201d she said gravely. \u201cThey do what they want.\u201d\n\nThey stood in a small, complicated space and the city continued to move around them like a polite animal. It was easier than it could have been. Jessa put her cigarette back in its case so that no one had the excuse of a smoke to leave. Tariq declared himself in need of a drink with the timing of a saint and then did not have one. Anya appeared by a column wearing the expression of someone who has found herself in the row with her least favourite ex-student and discovered he has improved; she took Janine\u2019s elbow for a second, not so much to guide as to share practical weight.\n\nThere was still a stage and still lights cooling and still a choreography of interviews and the polite violence of cameras that needed faces. Crispin made consider-it eyes from a respectful distance like a nature documentary narrator acknowledging a mother with cubs. Madi mouthed wrap in his general direction and he had the sense to accept being told. Somewhere the man in the fox costume was half out of his head and regretting every choice he\u2019d ever made that had led to him profiting from children\u2019s birthdays. Somewhere the woman with the balloons had finally explained physics to her son by letting one go.\n\nThey made their way towards the doors in a small herd, letting the happy strangers press them from the sides and not minding the fingerprints. Outside, the afternoon was doing a good impression of an evening and the plaza had the sort of wind that didn\u2019t bother announcing itself. People stepped out into it with coats that had been designed for better towns. Tariq positioned himself so that anyone taking a photo might accidentally get his good side. Jessa held the bouquet under her arm like a medieval weapon. Janine kept very upright and walked at a pace that said she would choose what would happen next even in a crowd. Nate felt lighter in the legs than he usually did after dancing and decided this was what happens when terror burns cleanly instead of sooty.\n\nAcross the square, a boy of about eight practised mimicking one of Nate\u2019s steps for a friend with the exact seriousness of the self-taught, legs doing their best impression of precision. His friend clapped at the wrong place and corrected himself, and the two of them folded away into their mothers, who were already planning to tell their sisters about the night. A kid on a BMX ghosted through traffic he was not supposed to be in and shouted Stud in a tone that managed to be affectionate and insulting, which is to say it was perfect. From the edge of things, Mr. Clancy appeared like a rare weather condition and nodded at Nate once from under his flat cap and then left because he did not believe in prolonged public gestures. It was as near to a blessing as he would ever attempt.\n\nThey ended up at a cafe with a glass front and an army of chairs that all made the same noise when you moved them. Apparently every good thing today would come with lighting that flattened your skin. They took two tables and pushed them into one without asking permission. The waitress, who had done ten of these nights and had collected them like stamps, brought chips, tea, and a piece of cake so dense it had a gravitational field. Maya took off her shoes under the table and sighed and then did not apologise for it. She fed Lyla chips like she was domesticating a dragon. Janine unfolded a napkin on her lap and immediately forgot it existed. Jessa tried to reach for her packet and then remembered the cafe had rules and settled for twisting her ring and looking at the ceiling like it had wronged her personally. Tariq told a version of the lift that made the laws of physics wave politely and step aside.\n\nHis father sat at the end, just outside the noise, hands on his knees the way people used to do at funerals and weddings, and watched without staring. He had a way of smiling now that made his eyes smaller and kinder; Nate did not recognise it and decided he would not be cruel about the delay. After a while, his father cleared his throat again, and it had less to clear this time. \u201cDo you need,\u201d he began, and stopped, and the napkins in the universe held their breath. \u201cDo you need anything?\u201d He looked at Janine when he said the last word, as if he had resat a default setting he had not used in nine years.\n\n\u201cWe need him to sleep,\u201d Janine said, after a second in which you could have balanced a plate. \u201cWe need a stable rent for six months and for the bus not to change its timetable without telling him because he will be late and say it is his fault. We need a new hinge for the cupboard under the sink and no more brown envelopes without warning.\u201d She took a drink of her tea as if to underline the points. \u201cOther than that,\u201d she concluded, \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do the hinge,\u201d he said, relief and sadness sharing a chair. \u201cI can do the bus timetable if I write a letter. I can do two months of the rent and then ask if that helps. I can\u2019t promise anything past that because I\u2026 because I won\u2019t. Not anymore.\u201d He placed a folded envelope on the table that was thick enough to be awkward and thin enough to be sincere, and then pushed it towards the centre like an offering to a god. \u201cYou can hate me and still\u2014let me do that. I won\u2019t stand in the kitchen for it. I won\u2019t ask what you buy. I\u2019ll just\u2014do that.\u201d\n\nJanine looked him in the face with her proper look and did her accounting inside her head where no one could disturb it. She did not touch the envelope because she respected its power to set rooms on fire. \u201cYou can,\u201d she said, and the cafe did not even notice the kind of moment it was hosting. \u201cWe can. We will not thank you for old fires. We will thank you for hinges and two months.\u201d She offered him a corner of a smile that contained all the mathematics of adult life. \u201cYou can come to the next if you can be silent in the way that counts and loud in the way that doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can be both,\u201d he said, and for once you believed him.\n\nIt was not tidy. There was not a violin in the corner that started up because they had arrived at resolution. There were chips and crumbs and the squeak of chairs and the fact of the city outside doing the brave, boring work of being itself. There would be phone calls later to answer and messages to ignore and one from Crispin that would be easy to swat away because the night had taught Nate where his no lived. There would be a knee that muttered again because bodies cannot be argued with for free. There would be a text from Maya at 2 a.m. that said I have never been this tired and also alive, please advise, and he would send her a horse emoji because he did not have horse tranquillity to prescribe in pill form. There would be the ordinary mercy of sleep.\n\nWhen they walked back to the bus stops, Janine took his hand the way you take a parcel that you know contains fragile and necessary things. Lyla carried the lilies blunt-side-up as if she had been born for that sort of choreography. Tariq told the night porter for the Centre that he was the lead barber on the production and the man pretended to be impressed in the way men do when they recognise someone else\u2019s need to be taller. Jessa fell behind on purpose to blow smoke at the idea of fate and then caught up because she could not resist a good exit line. His father peeled off at the corner and lifted his palm without committing to a wave and looked back only once, which meant he had done something heroic according to the alarming rulebook of fathers who try again.\n\nOn the top deck of the bus, the city was softer, as if someone had turned the fabric over and revealed the weave. Nate put his forehead to the glass and let its chill whittle down the edges of his mind. The lights of the shops made a little theatre out of nothing. In the reflection he could still see the stage-version of himself hovering a fraction to the left of the real, the way a double exposure makes you look briefly haunted. He felt the weight of the envelope in his mother\u2019s bag like a tiny planet and decided he would not let it tilt their orbit without their consent. He thought about the lift and the mistake that had made the count truer and smiled into his arm because the best parts of anything were always a little misaligned.\n\nAt the house, they took their shoes off at the door because even on big nights you obey the carpet. Janine put the lilies in the good vase as if she had never once called it the silly vase, and the water took the stems like an oath. Lyla stuck the banner to the wall above the television with tape that would test the paint\u2019s character in the morning. Nate stood in the kitchen and let the kettle talk to him about steam and time. When he went into his room he waited for his heart to remind him to be careful and it did not; it reminded him to be brave instead. He lay back and listened to the small noises of the house negotiating with the night. Somewhere a fox screamed, which is to say it stately announced itself to all animals everywhere, and he laughed because a fox screaming at the sky after a good thing had happened was exactly the sort of nonsense the world liked to chip in.\n\nSleep came, not as a tunnel, but as a lake he could step into without checking its depth first. He went under with his eyes open and found that it was clearer than he remembered. In the morning, the weather would begin again as if it had invented the idea of consistency. He would go to the yard to be reminded where his hands ended and the animal began. He would read messages from people he hadn\u2019t spoken to since school who would tell him they always knew he would, and he would believe some of them and put the rest in a drawer. He would answer Crispin properly and kindly and keep his words. He would stretch and ice and be humble and not small. He would be asked to do that piece again somewhere brighter and he would decide if brighter served the piece. He would be what he had decided to be yesterday when he stepped into the light and let it make its measurements. He would keep saying no to the things that wanted the mud but not the work and yes to the things that smelt of hay and counted in fours.\n\nAnd for a while, in the kind of silence that chooses you and not the other way around, the world met him halfway.",

Nate\u2019s phone woke up before he did and jittered itself along the bedside like it wanted to roll away and start a second life under the chest of drawers. He lay very still with his eyes closed and counted to twelve because twelve had been good to him lately, and then he let the world in. Messages layered themselves like pastry. Tariq had sent a video of himself shaving a man who insisted on calling a fade a \u201cgentle cliff,\u201d overlaid with the caption I did the hair so you did the air. Jessa had sent a photo of an unlit cigarette on a saucer\u2014it looked like a museum piece\u2014with the title restraint, for you. Maya had sent three words, we didn\u2019t drown, and four trophy emojis and then, contradicting herself two minutes later, a voice note in which her breath was still visible between the words. \u201cMy dad cried once and then pretended to find something in his eye for the entire second half,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you tell him I told you, I will say you\u2019re a liar who lies and also owes me soup.\u201d There were unknown numbers with greetings that came in corporate fonts, a smattering of hearts from people he could place by the kind of punctuation they used, and a crisp who is this from an old classmate that felt like a pebble thrown into his childhood window.\n\nAt the yard, the cold had been trimmed to a respectable shape. The water in the troughs wore a delicate lid that broke with the sound of small manners being discarded. Mr. Clancy was already there in a coat that had seen several winters and chosen not to comment. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, as Nate ducked under the stable door into the smell that meant honest work, and the word well hung there with enough to be going on with. \u201cDon\u2019t be bringing the BBC in here again.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an answer, which was his talent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not bringing anybody in,\u201d Nate said. He moved slow among the bodies he could read like a grammar book he\u2019d learned as a child. \u201cI\u2019ve been informed I\u2019m not allowed to adopt the stallion, film the stallion, or introduce the stallion to experimental lighting.\u201d He ran the broom under the gate like he was combing a giant\u2019s fringe. Dynamo watched him with the unimpressed expression of an elder deity whose worshippers have discovered Instagram.\n\nThe boss\u2014Mrs. Pritchard, a woman made of tweed and spine whose mouth could say tea and thunder with the same economy\u2014appeared in the aisle with a set of rubber gloves like a sermon. \u201cYou had a circus,\u201d she announced. She didn\u2019t need to employ a rising intonation; she wasn\u2019t asking for context. \u201cOn my yard. With reflectors. Reflectors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said no,\u201d Nate said, and he put the broom against the wall because he\u2019d learned you couldn\u2019t hold your ground properly while holding anything else. \u201cHe\u2014Crispin\u2014moved a runner near Dynamo. I moved the runner back. Dynamo did what Dynamo does. Nobody got kicked. I\u2019m sorry it happened. It won\u2019t again. Not without your say-so. Not at all, if you want. I told them Lovey and the fence and they wanted the big lad. I said no then, and I\u2019m saying no now again, in case the walls missed it.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pritchard\u2019s eyes did a slow movement from Nate to the horses and back that had weighed out many men and not found them worth a handful of bran. \u201cDon\u2019t give me media,\u201d she said, as if the word itself had broken a promise to her once. \u201cGive me the sweepings and the feed and the schoolkids who think poo is a joke and then realise it\u2019s a job. You\u2019ve got a thing on the side now. That\u2019s your business. Don\u2019t make it mine.\u201d She paused, assessing whether she needed to say more, and decided to throw him a penny. \u201cYou did right with him. He\u2019ll never love you. That\u2019s not what some animals are for. He\u2019ll respect you if you keep not dying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made that my brand,\u201d Nate said, and she gave him the ghost of a grin, which meant they would behave as usual and complain about anything new.\n\nBack home, the kitchen had donned its after-party face\u2014glasses that didn\u2019t belong to their cupboard, a ribbon pretending not to be attached to anything, the faint smell of cake like a rumour. Janine had tied her hair up with a pen because the ribbons had declared industrial action. The brown envelope was now white and had the council logo in the corner, and it sat on the table with a novelty mug on top of it like a flimsy paperweight guarding its own cousin. \u201cYour father\u2019s coming in twenty,\u201d she said without preamble, and someone who didn\u2019t know her would have missed the drama entirely. \u201cWith a hinge.\u201d\n\n\u201cA hinge,\u201d Nate repeated. There was a kind of relief in the word. Hinges were things that attached one solid object to another and allowed movement; they had laws. He could handle a hinge.\n\nLyla came down the stairs holding a bouquet that had been deconstructed by a sixteen-year-old monster who wanted to see how things worked; the lilies had been demoted to jam jars, the ferns had been conscripted into the potted basil and looked excited by the promotion. \u201cI\u2019m making a shrine,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s modern. It has mixed media. It will be studied by future generations in my art book. Also, there\u2019s a man called Crispin calling me from a number with more numbers than seems legal. He wanted a quote. I gave him a quote. He did not enjoy my quote.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Janine asked, only mildly afraid.\n\n\u201cI told him if he wants an angle he can go stand on the stairs,\u201d Lyla said. \u201cHe hung up, which was rude. If he rings back I\u2019m charging per syllable.\u201d\n\nPaul Ellison arrived at eleven with the structure of someone who has practised not arriving and was learning it again. He held a toolbox that had belonged to his father and the metal handle had that shine tools get when hands have told them secrets for decades. He had, to everyone\u2019s relief and vague disappointment, bought no more flowers. He did bring a packet of custard creams and a loaf of sliced bread in a bag from a shop that always smelt of floor cleaner and sugar. \u201cYou said hinge,\u201d he said, and let his eyes land on the cupboard beneath the sink like a man meeting a rival he\u2019d heard a lot about. \u201cI can do hinge.\u201d\n\nJanine stood back like she would for anyone with a drill. \u201cIt\u2019s on a slant,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything in this house is on a slant. It\u2019s an attitude problem. Do what you can. If it goes wrong, the cupboard has been threatening to become a hole for years, so we may as well get the panic over with.\u201d She looked at his hands, which moved like they remembered usefulness despite the intermission. He did the hinge in five minutes longer than a hero would have and ten minutes quicker than a fool. He swore once under his breath in the polite way of men who respect women in houses\u2014no theatricals, no apologies, a little rhythm to help the screw recognise the hole.\n\nLyla watched from the doorway with her arms folded and her adolescent antennae listening for the sound of a promise. \u201cAre you going to be weird,\u201d she said to him directly. He supplied her with a couple of honest answers, which was more than she\u2019d expected.\n\n\u201cI am going to try not to be,\u201d he said. He put the screwdriver down with the gravity of a man unloading a weapon. \u201cI will probably fail and then try again. You can call me out. I will attempt to take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and returned a screwdriver to the box upside down, on purpose, because kindness is not the only test a person needs to pass. Janine poured tea and did not ask him if he took sugar because she remembered he didn\u2019t; he pretended not to be surprised by her memory. They drank standing up because sitting down felt too ceremonial, and the hinge worked, and nobody mentioned that the cupboard door had closed easily for the first time in months.\n\nLater, rehearsal began with the silent agreement that they would not discuss last night until their bodies had done something with it. Madi had already drawn a square on the floor with blue tape that meant you could not stand where the square was unless you had something to offer it. \u201cWe\u2019re doing less,\u201d she announced, as if this would be greeted with a parade. \u201cYou did plenty. I want less for this next piece. Less that reads like more. Everyone wants fireworks. Give me matches. The internet will hate it and then three smart people will love it and we will sleep fine.\u201d She motioned them to the tape and they stepped in obediently, like apprentices who trust the sorcerer has thought this through.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d came Crispin, which is how men like Crispin announce themselves when they want points for manners. \u201cTwo things. One is small, one is also small if you are flexible. The stream wants a micro-doc. We do you at the house, domestic, old photos if your mother will share, dad story toned to acceptable pathos, we get a quote from Mr. Ellison because he is back in the picture, we talk about forgiveness. Second, we partner you for a brand live on Saturday. No product in frame, just vibes. You two in front of a wall of trainers. It\u2019s not an advert; it\u2019s a conversation about movement. Think youth, think energy, think Milton on a bus.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo to the house,\u201d Nate said, before the phrases had finished their attempt at being charming. The no felt like a coin he had polished. \u201cNo to dad stories on your camera. That\u2019s mine. If he wants to tell anything, he can do it in his own kitchen and you can ask him for directions, which he will get wrong. We don\u2019t make my mother tidy the living room for your pathos. Yes to the trainers if we can pick the wall, the time, and if the conversation isn\u2019t about shoes. We\u2019ll talk about floor. We like floor.\u201d\n\nCrispin twitched the way good salesmen twitch when a scheme needs to redraw itself. \u201cWe can do a corridor,\u201d he offered. \u201cNo home. But surely\u2026 we don\u2019t invent arcs; we just\u2026 follow them where they go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you call my mum\u2019s council letter an arc,\u201d Nate said, not angry, only done, \u201cI\u2019ll ask Dynamo to step on your brand new suede shoes. He\u2019ll know where to put his hoof, he\u2019s very precise. We\u2019re dancing. Let us dance. After, if I want to be sad in public, I will. Today is not that day.\u201d\n\nMadi, who could not in good conscience do violence on behalf of her dancers but could in good conscience suggest it beautifully, stepped half a pace forward. \u201cThe little films we owe the stream are about the work,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want tears, go to cinema. We\u2019ll give you sweat. You\u2019ll love it. Your mother will love it. The internet will complain, which means they will watch it three times.\u201d She did the smile that had persuaded more than one money person to back slowly away and leave the artists to it.\n\nCrispin raised his palms in agreeably defeated surrender and nodded as if he had planned to be told no as part of a long con. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, \u201cfloor chat Saturday. I\u2019ll text options. You two: not too clever. Clever is for critics. Real is for the people.\u201d He moved on to bother the boy in the silver hoodie, who had started pretending to stretch as a decoy and got punished by an earnest lecture about authenticity and headwear.\n\nWhen they were left to their square of tape and their section of air, Madi had them walk. Just that. Walk the square. \u201cEverything is in the walk,\u201d she said, a sentence every teacher says with a different kind of authority. \u201cIf your walk is honest, the trick lives in it. If your walk lies, I will see the lie in the turn.\u201d Maya obeyed the instruction with visible impatience that refined under observation into something like grace. She had the walk of a girl who has been on the receiving end of boys\u2019 attention and decided to direct it herself. Nate had a country walk that softened in a city and a stage walk that had learned not to apologise. They walked and then did not walk, which is to say they stilled themselves, and you could feel the shape of it for a long breath.\n\nOn a break, he stepped into the corridor that smelt of coffee and old carpet glue and called home, because his fingers needed the reassurance of his mother\u2019s ring tone. Janine answered on the third ring and had bread in her mouth, which somehow made her greeting warmer. \u201cThe hinge holds,\u201d she reported, before he could ask what was more important. \u201cWe have an email from the landlord\u2019s agent with words like index and fair. Mrs. Khanna\u2019s nephew says we can make a fuss and the fuss would be righteous. He offered to write words he calls templates. I\u2019ve always liked a template. He also says council have a quiet pot for people on the edges. He said edges like it was a place you could visit. We\u2019ll visit. For tonight, we\u2019re all right. Your father has left and he took his toolbox and left the bread and he didn\u2019t look round to see if I was watching because he is trying very hard. That\u2019s enough domestic for this call. Go and pretend to be normal at work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am normal at work,\u201d he said, smiling into the phone. \u201cWe\u2019re walking. Madi says my walk better be honest. I\u2019ll avoid my swagger because I haven\u2019t got one.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cSwagger breaks kettles. Bring me gossip later. I have stuck the banner at an angle and it is driving me wild. The house is testing me.\u201d\n\nMaya came back from her own call with her schoolbag still on her shoulder, which meant the phone had been with her father. \u201cHe said no to television,\u201d she reported with a mix of relief and annoyance that adult children will understand forever. \u201cHe said we can do a photo. He asked me if he should buy a hat. I said yes because I want to be a person whose father owns a hat he didn\u2019t need.\u201d She sat on the floor with the kind of exhaustion that has a degree. \u201cAlso, I did an exam. It was about friction, irony intended. I will pass. I might rage between now and the passing.\u201d\n\nHe lay down beside her and looked at the damp patches the ceiling had tried to repair after the last leak, like clouds had retired there and taken up plastering. \u201cWe will do less,\u201d he said. \u201cLess is a skill. My friend Jessa can smoke less. My mum can worry less. I can say no more and it counts as less of something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are being philosophical,\u201d she said. \u201cI like you with sleep. You should patent it.\u201d She rolled on her side to face him, plait trailing a map on the floor. \u201cLast night you did the panic catch and you didn\u2019t make it look like a catch. I just want you to know I know, and I won\u2019t tell anyone because I am kind, but I will weaponise it in a future argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect nothing less,\u201d he said, and they went back to counting the ugly ceiling stains like constellations.\n\nSaturday\u2019s trainer wall experience played out like all branded events try to: too much sound, not enough air, a DJ with confidence like a health condition and a crowd made of teenagers and their more skeptical older siblings. The wall glittered with shoes that had price tags like threatening letters. They stood in front of it and did precisely what they had promised Crispin they would do\u2014talked about floor. Maya did an excellent impression of a historian when she talked about lino versus wood, and Nate, asked by a boy in a fluorescent beanie which shoe made him dance better, said honestly, \u201cthe one I can forget I\u2019m wearing,\u201d and the manager, who had wanted him to say a particular number, sighed without hatred. Lyla filmed from a vantage point that made everybody\u2019s jawlines look expensive and added captions that would make a university professor fight a child. When they were done, a kid asked for a selfie and then, because courage acts like a muscle, said, \u201cMy stepdad says dance is for swots. What should I tell him?\u201d and Maya, without missing a count, said, \u201cTell him swots can do the splits,\u201d and the kid said \u201csweet\u201d with the triumph of a joke that counts as revenge.\n\nThat afternoon in the yard, ordinary paid Nate's balance. Lovey demanded he do a sign check on her feet and then pretended to be offended. Dynamo had a good day because the world had not given him anything brighter than it needed to. A girl of nine who\u2019d been sent to learn not to fear large animals stood with her hands deep in her coat pockets and announced, like a newsreader, \u201cI don\u2019t like noses because they do breathing,\u201d and Nate, because he too had sometimes suspected the nose of ulterior motives, showed her how to offer a palm and wait until the horse chose to bring the nose to the hand. The girl endured it the way children endure medicine that works and afterwards declared she was cured of noses and would like to ride a dragon next, something in the shovel-to-sky family.\n\nThat evening, Paul rang and sounded like a man calling from an empty room he was trying to make into a comfortable lie. \u201cThe man with the shoes called me,\u201d he said. He never did names when names felt like alliances. \u201cAsked if I wanted to talk about you. I told him I\u2019m learning. I told him I won\u2019t make our business belong to a man wearing jewellery on his wrist. He said he could blur things. I hung up on him because I have discovered I enjoy that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Nate said, aware of the strange shock of pleasure delivered by an adult behaving like an adult when you aren\u2019t expecting it. \u201cI\u2019m keeping the dancing for the dancing. You can keep the regrets for whatever they\u2019re useful for. We\u2019ll do a Sunday roast one day and you can apologise to potatoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do potatoes,\u201d Paul said with the cautious pride of a man recalling his one specialty. \u201cI can do gravy. I am still not coming to your house without warning. I\u2019ll ring. I\u2019ll see you next week. Don\u2019t\u2026 break.\u201d The line did the tiny crackle old lines do and then they were both released back into their respective rooms.\n\nAnya implemented a plan she had, she claimed, stolen from a stern Russian woman in 1998. \u201cWe train outdoors,\u201d she said on Monday, as the heating in the hall failed with an apologetic cough. \u201cYou think you know your balance, and then the grass says you don\u2019t. Bring layers. If you fall, learn something on the way down.\u201d They took their counts to the miserable heroism of a car park and then to the strip of municipal green with a wind that didn\u2019t love them. The first two passes looked like outtakes from a documentary about deer learning to skate. By the third, Nate could feel his ankles telling him the truth about themselves, and Maya discovered her left foot, the one with a tendency to stage a union meeting at awkward times, liked dirt better than sprung floor. \u201cI hate outside,\u201d she announced into her scarf. \u201cOutside can do one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOutside is where the horses are,\u201d he said, which was not an argument so much as a map.\n\nBy Wednesday, word had made its clumsy way around Milton in the way Milton did it\u2014two barbershops, a WhatsApp group for parents who never slept, the vicar\u2019s wife who pretended to hate gossip but relayed it with admirable fidelity. The pub had chalked Congratulations Stud! on the A-board with a little drawing that was either a horse or a man in an unfortunate hat. A boy with a BMX had added a moustache to the drawing while a barman watched and chose peace. The barbershop hummed with men who said they didn\u2019t watch dance and then quoted back lines Maya had said about floor. Tariq split himself between work and showboating like a man with two lovers and pulled both off because overpromising to the day was his art. He whispered in Nate\u2019s ear as he did his hair, \u201cThe phone has been a busy mother. Two new lads came in and asked for \u2018the Stud,\u2019 which is both offensive and satisfying. Look at me, coining a cut. I will retire with a cape.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t retire,\u201d Nate said, closing his eyes while the clippers did their kindly thunder. \u201cWho will narrate my life?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will record an audio guide you can play quietly on the bus,\u201d Tariq said. \u201cPress one for encouragement. Press two for roasting. Press three for a synopsis of the plot. By the way, Jessa is going to kill her boss. She won\u2019t, because orange isn\u2019t her colour, but she will write a letter and then read it out to weak men with clipboards. She told me to tell you to show your face at the youth club on Thursday and remind the children that dancing hasn\u2019t gone out of fashion since TikTok. Don\u2019t be late. She will set your shoe laces on fire.\u201d\n\nThursday at the youth club, the flooring situation gave up on being a situation and was a problem. The hall was a rectangle whose sides had seen multiple generations of cheap chairs. The stereo was a veteran of the Falklands or behaved like one. The faces in front of him were that wonderful mixture of disdain and curiosity that only children and cats carry off with grace. Lyla had already inflated her importance by shouting, \u201cAttention, peasants,\u201d something Jessa allowed on the grounds of comedy value and because the kids took it as intended. Nate introduced a step so basic it felt like breathing and then complicated it until even the surliest boy admitted his limbs could learn new vocabulary if bribed with praise. A girl in hooped earrings did a little shoulder isolation that would have impressed Madi and then shrugged when the room applauded it like she was tired of being applauded for the obvious. Jessa watched from the doorway with her cigarette absent and her hands in pockets, and afterwards she gave him a nod that was loud enough to count as a speech.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d she said, outside, when they were walking back toward the trolley bay that had never once had any trolleys in it. \u201cYou are in the habit of being good without making people lick your shoes for it. Keep that. Also, my boss can eat bin fire. He told me if I want breaks I should stop drinking water. I told him I\u2019ll stop drinking water when he stops needing oxygen. There will be a vote. I will pretend to play nicely. It will be sexy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get sacked,\u201d he said, knowing she would not take the instruction but liking the ritual of trying to save her from herself.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will. Or he will become softer. Pain does that to men when you apply it properly. I am an artist.\u201d She stopped to watch a fox swagger along the low wall opposite like it owned the postcodes of two counties and they both felt the rightness of the fox existing near bins and miracles.\n\nOn Friday, the thing with Dynamo was small in the way panic is small when you catch it early. He was off, not wrong, but off, the way a favourite song sounds weird when someone you don\u2019t like sings along. Nate noticed it in the shift of weight over the front right, the micro-stall that happens when an animal is arguing with pain but too proud to mention it. He called Mrs. Pritchard with the particular humility Lance Corporals use when addressing Generals and said, quietly, \u201cI\u2019m seeing something,\u201d and she, without drama, ran her hands down a leg that had been made before cars and machines and too-bright lights and said, \u201cStone bruise or a fairy. Cold hose it. He\u2019ll be swearing at you in an hour. If he\u2019s still telling me fairy stories tomorrow, we\u2019ll get the vet. Tell him I said he is not special and it\u2019s good for him.\u201d They did the cold hose, ten on, ten off, the kind of patient work that doesn\u2019t look like devotion and is, and Dynamo took it like a civil rights violation and then began to relax under the logic of water. Nate stayed long after the hose had been put away and listened to the quiet talk of big animals settling.\n\nHis father texted, unprompted, that he had found a better brand of tea and that he intended to make Nate drink it as proof of his commitment to improved taste. \u201cYou can\u2019t improve taste,\u201d Nate wrote back, and then after a beat added, \u201cCome by next Sunday if the kettle lets you. I will be home. You can meet my friend who smokes but not in the kitchen. We will not do feelings. We will do buns.\u201d He regretted it and then didn\u2019t; invitation had always been a muscle he avoided exercising for fear of dropping the weight.\n\nThere was talk, inevitably, on the internet about romantic tension. It had the tender, intrusive energy of aunties at weddings. Clips of the quiet part in their piece gained traction and the comments section decided it had invented softness. Maya forwarded him a screen grab of one speculative thread and captioned it with, \u201cDo we sue?\u201d and a picture of a gavel. He sent back a photo of Dynamo\u2019s ear and wrote, \u201cHe says privacy is delicious.\u201d They didn\u2019t mention the thing you don\u2019t mention when one of you is twenty-four and the other is eighteen and the air in between is complicated. They simply did the clean work and let the rest fuss in corners until it got tired.\n\nOn Saturday, which is when the city pretends to be a town because that\u2019s easier on the purse, the Centre was full of fathers with buggies practising in public and teenagers who had learned how to occupy space as anointment. Crispin turned up in a shirt his mother would have described as cheerful and tried to convince their piece to be performed at noon in a shop window \u201cfor the people,\u201d and Madi said, flat, \u201cOur people can buy tickets like anyone else,\u201d and then bought a pretzel with his company card and told them to take an hour for themselves. They sat on the steps by the fake lake and watched the fake ducks pretend to be above it all. Maya put her chin on her knees and said, \u201cIf I pass physics I will invent a new type of regret that doesn\u2019t sting and market it to poets,\u201d and he said, \u201cI will sell you to poets,\u201d and she said, \u201cI am too expensive,\u201d and they experienced the kind of quiet that is usually reserved for churches.\n\nSunday afternoon arrived the way Sundays do, with a funny sort of mercy that doesn\u2019t last the night. Paul showed up on time, carrying the tea and the kind of expression men wear when they have memorised the steps to a dance and intend to perform them without improvising. He had bought scones. He had not tried to bake. He took his shoes off at the door, delighting Janine and derailing her planned joke. Jessa came by with an excuse about borrowing a book and stayed to audition him gently. She said, \u201cDo you believe in unions?\u201d with the energy of a woman checking if a man is a vegetarian before she serves him a steak and when he said, \u201cI do now, after a man with a clipboard told me I couldn\u2019t use the toilet at a motorway depot,\u201d she granted him the right to eat the jam without commentary. They did not do feelings. They did buns. They did tea taste testing like children in a science segment. Lyla filmed none of it because she had a divine sense of when to act like a door, not a window. When he left, he put his hand on the hinge of the front door in a very silly symbolic gesture, rolled his eyes at himself, and said, \u201cIt holds,\u201d and Janine, by way of a benediction, said, \u201cFor now,\u201d and then closed the door with a softness that told the house it would be consulted next time.\n\nMonday\u2019s rehearsal was the best kind of boring, the kind of afternoon that disappears in the doing and leaves you with muscles that are grateful for instruction. Madi gave them notes that were less than sentences. \u201cLift: exhale,\u201d she said. \u201cEnding: don\u2019t present it like a birthday cake.\u201d Anya, from the back, offered silence, which was praise in her dialect. They left early enough for coffee that did not taste like disappointment and sat in a cafe that had assaulted the walls with plants until the oxygen had improved. Maya, mid-sip, asked, \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll teach?\u201d without adding anytime soon or when your knee starts misbehaving like an old Labrador.\n\n\u201cI might,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a peace in telling someone what to do with their feet and then watching the lightbulb. It\u2019s like mucking out. You can see the beginning and the end of a job. You feel taller inside your skin. But I don\u2019t want to teach because I\u2019m scared of failing at the other thing. I want to teach because the other thing is generous enough to be shared.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d she said, mock-wiping at her eyes with her sleeve. \u201cPoetry. People will think you\u2019re insufferable. I will tell them you are. They\u2019ll love you more.\u201d Her phone buzzed and she looked at it and frowned. \u201cThat man again. The one who wants to interview my ankle. I\u2019m going to block him and then unblock him out of curiosity and then block him again. Entertainment is a circle.\u201d\n\nHe walked her to the bus and leaned on the shelter that had caught more confessions than a confessional. The bus pulled in with that roar buses use to tell you they are bigger than your life, and she got on and turned back and did the ridiculous bow he pretended not to recognise, and then the bus left, and he stood with the discarded feeling that follows good company like a sensible dog.\n\nOn the way home he took the long cut through the little triangle of trees that made believe it was a wood and met Mr. Clancy leaning on a fence with an air of having leaned there before roads. \u201cThere\u2019s talk,\u201d Mr. Clancy said, which was a statement, not an invitation. \u201cAbout your father. About this and that. Men in pubs who hold forth. Don't listen to men who hold forth. They\u2019re only practicing their voices because they never got to sing.\u201d He spat with elegance and then offered Nate a peppermint in a way that implied he was giving him secrets. \u201cKeep your hands soft,\u201d he added. \u201cAnimals mostly talk in hands.\u201d\n\nAt home, the council letter had reproduced into an appointment. Mrs. Khanna\u2019s nephew had emailed PDFs with titles like Unexpected Outcomes and Precise Words That Make People in Offices Sit Down. Janine had found a pen that preferred blue and was writing in a list that contained the headings bread, rent, feelings, in that order. She looked up when Nate came in like a lighthouse acknowledging a returning boat and made room for him in the kitchen light with the ease of a person who had practised welcoming. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said, tapping the word on the page with the pen. \u201cWe will go to the office and I will make my voice do its thing. You will come and sit and breathe and look tall and responsible. Then you will run off at the last minute to dance if you must, and I will tell them the truth which is that you belong in more than one place. They will hate that. It\u2019s not efficient. It is, however, true.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, felt the stretch in his neck like a story being told, and went to the sink because washing up had always been the way he asked the day if it had any last words. The plate was warm under his fingers and he thought, as he sometimes did when the ordinary made itself important, that if someone had told him a year ago this would be what it would feel like to be in the middle of something, he would have laughed and called them ambitious for him and therefore to be avoided. He finished the mug, turned it upside down on the drying rack with its little collection of upside-down things, and thought, with a clarity that felt rented but generous, about counts and edges. Tomorrow, he would walk into a room where someone would say no to him and he would ask them to say it again with more honesty. Tomorrow, he would bargain for the right to live in the same rooms in which he had been made. Tomorrow, he would catch Maya mid-air and change the count again by the thickness of a hair.\n\nHe went to bed with the kind of tired that had dignity. Before sleep took him without fuss, he looked at his ceiling and considered the twenty-year-old cracks that had told his teenage self to be braver and found them in a kinder light. The house shifted the way old houses do when they remember stories they won\u2019t repeat. In the yard, Lovey dreamt from one foot and then the other, and Dynamo, resentful even in sleep, refused to forget the hose. In several pockets of the city, people who had clapped last night remembered their hands and smiled with them. On a phone on a bedside table, south of his, a girl with plaits sent a text that read, tomorrow we fight a camera and a bureaucrat, wear your lucky socks, and he wrote back, I have only lucky socks now, and then the night turned its face toward the corner of the room and allowed them rest.",

                              "content": "The council building had the kind of carpet that taught your shoes to whisper. It was a colour invented to make the idea of colour seem unreasonable, and there were posters over the radiator about compost and community that had faded into their own optimism. Janine walked in with her voice tied back and her bag full of proofs the way a magician carries scarves\u2014plentiful and ready. She had ironed the edge of a letter and it had succumbed. Nate walked beside her carrying height and a folder with his name on the tab, the kind of folder that grants you ten per cent more authority simply by existing. He had put on the jacket that pretended to be formal and succeeded only in looking like a man who owned a formal jacket. He took a breath as they crossed the threshold because buildings like this liked to take the air out of your lungs and tell you they were keeping it for the responsible people.\n\nMrs. Khanna\u2019s nephew had furnished Janine with a packet of words called templates and a pep talk that included a flow chart and a joke about bins that might have been funnier to a different family. Janine had highlighted the sentences that made clerks put their pens down and listen, and her pen had highlighted them again as if they might run off if not sufficiently fluorescent. The receptionist was a woman with hair that defied gravity and glasses that suggested she knew the end of every story before it began. \u201cName?\u201d she asked, and Janine gave it with the crisp of someone who has practice at not being mislabelled. They sat on the plastic chairs that made everyone the same height and watched as numbers marched up on a screen with no interest in context.\n\nWhen their number was called, they went through a door into an office that had decided potted plants could atone for fluorescent lights. The man behind the desk had a tie that was a few inches more optimistic than his posture. A little plaque said GRAHAM BAIN in letters that had resigned themselves to being read by people who would forget them immediately. Graham smiled in that scrupulous way of people who have been taught to leaven process with kindness. \u201cMrs. Ellison, Mr. Ellison,\u201d he said, with a glance at their faces like a mourner checking the hymn sheet. \u201cTell me what\u2019s happened and then tell me the bit you left out when you practiced at home.\u201d\n\nJanine\u2019s smile was for herself, which was safer. \u201cIt\u2019s the rent,\u201d she said. \u201cIt decided to grow. The sum and the audacity. We can pay what we\u2019ve been paying. We can nearly pay more if we do maths with fewer biscuits. The letter says index and review and expectation. I brought copies of everything including the breakfast we didn\u2019t eat.\u201d\n\nGraham looked at the copies. He looked at the letter from the landlord\u2019s agent that had tried to sound apologetic and had achieved only a sort of polite pounce. He looked at the template phrases and nodded in the way men nod when women have brought in the right weapons. He looked at Nate and did that thing bureaucrats with empathy sometimes do where they ask the right question in the wrong voice. \u201cAnd you, sir,\u201d he said, as if he were meeting a ship, \u201cwhat do you\u2026 what is your regular?\u201d\n\n\u201cI work at a yard,\u201d Nate said, because truth sounded humble and he hadn\u2019t brought his actress today. \u201cHorses. Three mornings. Sometimes more. I dance. It isn\u2019t regular, except it is, like weather is regular. This month there\u2019s a show. There\u2019s a bag of money in the corner of the room labelled maybe. That bit will be a one-off and not a guarantee. I can be responsible for the mornings and the afternoons. The evenings are variable.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s tie performed the trick of looking like a man nodding. He typed the sort of typing that makes other people nervous. \u201cThere are pots,\u201d he said, as if confessing that his house had a secret space under the stairs. \u201cWe call them discretionary, which means we\u2019ll ask nosy questions and you will sigh and then we will be able to help until we can\u2019t. There\u2019s also a fair use conversation with the landlord about the index they\u2019ve chosen and whether it applies to your lease or to a general sense of the economy. We can write that letter for you and sign it as if we invented the word fair this morning. Mrs. Ellison, I see you have already drafted something that looks very much like what I would write if I were at home and cross.\u201d He slid the paper toward himself and blinked at the accuracy. \u201cYou can use my signature as a garnish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Janine said, letting relief go through her without knocking anything over on the way. \u201cWe like garnish.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll freeze the increase while the right people argue,\u201d Graham added. \u201cFour weeks, possibly eight if we get lucky with daylight. Bring me wage slips, and that bit of the internet that proves you did the performance, because the powers like to see you doing something that looks like ambition in a hat. Bring me your tenancy, which I assume you have memorised, and something with numbers on it that made you cry last night. I will email Mrs. Khanna\u2019s nephew because anyone with a nephew who can explain an index to his aunt is a friend in this building even if he doesn\u2019t know it yet.\u201d\n\nThey signed in the boxes that declare you real on paper. Janine used her pen with the ruthlessness of someone winning a board game quietly. Nate signed his name in the way he signed it at the stables when he agreed not to die on the premises. Graham shook their hands like a man who had decided to make his desk temporarily a place where things happen. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ll hear a lot of no that sounds like maybe and a lot of maybe that sounds like no. I will translate. Also, my daughter saw you last night,\u201d he added, turning his tie into a parent, \u201cand cried for two whole minutes and then decided to berate me about the fact that she wasn\u2019t born with better ankles. So, thank you for that.\u201d\n\nOutside, the air felt like a reasonable document. Janine\u2019s shoulders had dropped into the degree of descent that meant her body had accepted that it did not have to fight the entire building single-handed. She held the strap of her bag and, because nobody important was listening, allowed herself a half-grin. \u201cHe was a good one,\u201d she said. \u201cNot good as in saint, good as in does his job and doesn\u2019t make me bite him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a tie,\u201d Nate said, and she nodded, filing it. They stood under a piece of municipal art that had been welded to be profound and decided it could wait to be interpreted. Janine looked at her watch, which did not believe in style, and said, \u201cGo on then. Fight your camera. My voice can carry me to the bus. Text me after. I will be at the table with my friend template and my enemy the brown envelope.\u201d\n\nThe floor conversation had been allotted nineteen minutes in a corridor with a wall the exact shade of biscuit nobody ever chooses first. The camera was a kind boy with shoulders that had learned not to take up too much space. The sound woman had hair like a rainforest and the face of a person who has forgiven a lot of doors. Crispin had ceded the role of lion tamer to a junior producer whose excitement was so sincere it managed to cancel out ninety per cent of the manipulation in the pitch. \u201cWe want to talk about your surfaces,\u201d she said, holding a clipboard that had never borne any nonsense. \u201cWhere your feet meet the day. The metaphor will do the heavy lifting. We\u2019ll keep you on your good side.\u201d\n\n\u201cI only have one side,\u201d Nate said. \u201cIt\u2019s in discussions with my other side.\u201d He and Maya stood where the tape told them to stand and immediately shuffled an inch to account for where their bodies preferred to be. These were the small negotiations that made things honest. He looked down at the floor as if it were a person he was about to quote.\n\n\u201cFloor is the first partner,\u201d Maya said into the friendly darkness of the lens, because she had filed away a sentence that made sense and was bringing it out like a good cake. \u201cIf the floor is lying, nothing else can be true. You can tell when a floor has been cared for because you feel like you\u2019re not going to be punished for trusting it. Wood talks. Lino whispers. Concrete judges you and then forgives you if you apologise properly. Grass hates you and then teaches your ankles lessons you didn\u2019t consent to.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoes are the lie you willingly tell,\u201d Nate added. \u201cYou wear the lie that lets you forget your feet until the moment you need to remember them. The day I realised a good shoe is the one you forget was the day my dancing stopped trying to be clever and started trying to be kind. I still fall. Everyone falls. The floor catches you or it tells you exactly why it didn\u2019t. That\u2019s useful. You can work with useful.\u201d\n\nThe camera breathed. The boy holding it nodded a little, which is always a good sign. The sound woman\u2019s rainforest hair wrote notes in the air. The junior producer mouthed we love it with the genuine fervour of a convert. Crispin lurked with his impossible smile and kept his hands largely out of the frame, perhaps because he had been told a story that morning about a runner and a horse, and the moral had been very clear and very muddy.\n\nAfter, Maya\u2019s phone chimed like a polite bell. She looked and then made an expression like someone trying not to show their working. \u201cPhysics,\u201d she said, flat with triumph. \u201cTwo marks under the best and six above the disaster my brother suggested I was heading for. Dad bought a hat,\u201d she added, apropos of nothing in particular, except that human success is often celebrated with something that doesn\u2019t fit. \u201cIt is not the correct hat. He bought a hat for a man who thinks jazz is an alternative to therapy. He is very pleased. He will wear it to the show and Anya will make a noise like a kettle and then relate breathing exercises to hats. It will be perfect.\u201d\n\nAnya made her kettle-noise that afternoon pre-emptively, which was efficient. \u201cHats are an attitude,\u201d she said, without being asked. \u201cThey should be worn by heads that understand chairs. Children, today we reduce again. Less legs. Less everything. We practice leaving the stage without apologising to it. Do not bow to anyone who hasn\u2019t paid you. That includes me.\u201d\n\nMadi\u2019s less turned out to be a kind of more that discouraged showing off not because showing off is bad but because showing off is easy. She stood in front of them with her clipboard tucked under her arm and spoke quietly until the room had to lean in to listen. \u201cThe piece is going to begin with you walking,\u201d she said, as if unveiling a miracle. \u201cThen it will continue with you listening. The trick is to let people believe they are watching while you are busy listening. On minute two we will show them one thing that they cannot do and then politely refuse to explain it. The internet will riot and three impressive people who go to bed early will send me messages about breath. I will pretend I don\u2019t like being told I\u2019m right and then sleep better.\u201d\n\nThe less had an honesty that scared Nate a little in the good way. When you strip back the cleverness you have to stand in the middle of the thing being yourself, which is exactly the sort of trick the cleverness was invented to avoid. He found the count for his steps inside the beat of his breathing and left the rest to behave. Maya discovered that her body had a quieter grammar that could be as rude as her loud one. Anya watched and pinched the bridge of her nose, which is how she told them she approved.\n\nBetween all that honesty, life persisted with its messy measure. Jessa won a little war at the depot by standing very close to a table and explaining to it why breaks are not a garnish. \u201cWe had a vote,\u201d she told Nate on the phone as she walked home past the allotments like a general out for a smoke. \u201cThe clipboard did not like democracy but he didn\u2019t set it on fire. We have ten minutes. Twenty on a Friday. We have the right to drink water when our throats decide to behave like throats. I will write a poem about this and then turn it into a threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t threaten them with poetry,\u201d he said, knowing she would and it would work.\n\nAt the yard, the stone fairy left Dynamo\u2019s foot as if it had been dared to stay and had thought better of it. Mrs. Pritchard, after twenty-four hours of telling the bruise to mind its manners, allowed a half sentence of satisfaction. \u201cYou found it quick,\u201d she said, which was praise even if the tone sounded like the underside of a shovel. \u201cHe was being dramatic for a reason. If he does it again, we get the man with the truck and your bank account will cry. Until then, water and the way you talk at him like he is the only living being with opinions. It suits him.\u201d Nate stood with his palm on the slope of the horse\u2019s neck and felt the big pulse doing the old work of being alive. He breathed the way you do when you are public with an animal who remembers the last time you got it wrong and forgave you anyway.\n\nPaul sent a photo of the hat, which was indeed a statement about jazz and poor decisions. He had set it on the arm of a chair like he was breaking the news gently. \u201cBe kind,\u201d the text said, which was both a request and a boast. Nate sent back a picture of the horse\u2019s ear, because that had become his shorthand for privacy, and typed, \u201cKindness requires a context. Bring cake.\u201d Paul replied that he could bring potatoes masquerading as cake and Nate allowed him this one sin because he had learned that adults are simply taller children trying not to knock over glassware.\n\nCrispin, arguably chastened, redirected his appetites towards the boy in the silver hoodie, whose mother turned out to have a voice like a chainsaw that could cut through red tape and insincerity. He also made serious eyes at the woman in the red dress and was sent away with a paragraph about art that started in French and ended in a swear that did not require translation. He hovered at the edges of Nate\u2019s day like a weather app told there is no rain and still hoping for headlines. Nate found the pleasure in saying small yeses that cost him nothing and big nos that kept the house from becoming a set.\n\nOn the Thursday when everything felt too possible, Maya\u2019s brother arrived at rehearsal trailing an air of being unimpressed by anything that couldn\u2019t be fitted into a meme. He looked at Nate, looked at the floor, looked at the mirror, and then nodded to himself like someone who had decided to give a restaurant a second chance. \u201cYou\u2019re tall,\u201d he announced, as if entering data into the public record. \u201cThat helps.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not always,\u201d Maya said, without turning her head. She was mid-stretch and had turned stretching into a statement about confidence. \u201cTall falls further. Introduce yourself like a polite person.\u201d\n\n\u201cArjun,\u201d he said. He shook Nate\u2019s hand and did the teenage trick of evaluating a man while appearing to be too bored to evaluate anything. \u201cIf you hurt my sister I will post your worst angles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of angles,\u201d Nate said. \u201cYou will be up late.\u201d\n\nArjun considered this for a second and then said to Maya, \u201cHe\u2019s all right,\u201d like he\u2019d been appointed to governance. He sat at the back with a packet of crisps and an attitude and clapped at precisely the moments his face said he wouldn\u2019t. Anya let him exist because he was good at keeping his feet out of the way and bad at pretending to be superior to sincerity.\n\nThe day of the stream rehearsal for their less piece arrived with a sky that had chosen one grey and married it for life. The stage didn\u2019t know how to behave for less; it wanted to do lights like an apology. Madi stood in the centre with her thermos and told the lighting operator a bedtime story about restraint. \u201cYou will not blind my dancers,\u201d she said, voice mild and carrying. \u201cYou will put light where they are and let it sit like a cat. If the light goes for a walk without permission I will take its batteries out and give them to the bar.\u201d\n\nThey did the walk and the listen and the one impossible thing that belonged to them, and the camera did what respectful cameras do when offered something that does not shout: it crept closer on a good lens and paid attention. Afterwards, in the room where snacks go to fail, a junior exec with a haircut that had cost too much declared that subtlety was a risk and then found himself agreeing fervently with his own nervousness when Madi smiled a way that said he could trust the person in charge or lose his budget. \u201cPeople will adjust,\u201d she said, like a weather report. \u201cThey\u2019ll pretend they discovered nuance this afternoon. Then they will show their mums.\u201d\n\nAt home, the kitchen table had become a war room. The pile of papers had been subjugated into three neat stacks. Janine had lines in her forehead you could plant crops in. She wielded a phrase from the template like a sabre and played with different tones of voice to see which one made the cat from next door jump. \u201cWe will say financial hardship and necessary,\u201d she declared to the teapot. \u201cWe will say risk and community and long-term. We will say tenant of good standing and we will refrain from adding \u2018with beautiful son\u2019 although I want to, on moral grounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraham said four weeks,\u201d Nate said, bringing her a mug of something that purported to be chamomile and smelled like a clever hedge. \u201cWe can make four weeks into six if we call it a process.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can make anything into six weeks with the correct adjectives,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all right today. Stop looking at me like you need to anchor me. I am an anchor.\u201d\n\nLyla was making a zine on the floor that would be illegal in six countries and very popular in a seventh. She had titled it The House That Would Not Move and was cutting out pictures of kettles and shoes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to sell this at your next thing,\u201d she informed him, scissor-waving. \u201cWe\u2019re going to call it merch and make thirty-seven pounds and then donate it to Mrs. Khanna\u2019s nephew because I like how he emailed back, like a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not sell anything without a charmingly incorrect QR code,\u201d Janine said without looking up. \u201cPeople love a chase.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the man from the brand with the wall of trainers sent a basket of fruit that had been arranged by someone who identified as a stylist first and a farmer fourth. The bananas had been convinced to sit at an angle that made them look coy. Maya took one and ate it out of spite. \u201cWe\u2019re not endorsing,\u201d she said, through banana. \u201cWe are endorsing floor. If anyone asks I endorse gravity. And soup.\u201d\n\nMr. Clancy was at the fence again with a peppermint and an unsolicited thought. \u201cI watched your thing,\u201d he announced, as if the internet were a field he occasionally grazed in. \u201cMy niece showed me on her phone. You looked like you were going to fall and then not. That\u2019s proper. No one wants to watch a man who thinks he\u2019s got a contract with standing upright.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my entire technique,\u201d Nate said. He took the peppermint and felt its ridiculous freshness clean his mouth in a way bureaucracy never could. Dynamo chose that moment to sneeze on his sleeve like an elder statesman condemning modernity, and Mr. Clancy nodded as if the horse had underlined his point.\n\nOn the way to the hall that afternoon he passed the pub with the A-board, and someone had changed the chalk to read LESS IS MORE, STUD and added a doodle of a fox wearing a hat that looked suspiciously like Paul\u2019s. He took a photo and sent it to his father with the caption your influence is corrosive, and Paul sent back a photo of a potato and wrote culture, and it was fine because sometimes love sounds exactly like nonsense.\n\nNate and Maya spent the last half-hour of rehearsal on the thing that had almost come off their hands the day before. It was a turning catch that required a very specific faith in the laws of physics not to suddenly decide to revise themselves for sport. They tried it once and it went, witless and obedient. They tried it again and Maya\u2019s weight did that tiny surprise that comes with human bodies even when they are clear on their intentions. He compensated, the way you do when dancing with weather, and corrected with his hips rather than his shoulders so the correction didn\u2019t become a label. Madi clapped once and said, \u201cYou earned it,\u201d and Anya did not interrupt the praise, which was its own fact.\n\nThey walked out of the hall under the evening that hadn\u2019t decided whether to be pink or efficient. In the little triangle of trees the air held a smell like cold bread and not much else. Maya linked her arm through his for half a dozen steps and then let go not because she needed to but because letting go was part of the trick. \u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d she said, almost surprised and more amused than anything else. \u201cI thought I would be scared every time and instead I am a machine with a slot for fear and it eats coins.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to save fear like pocket change,\u201d he said. \u201cPut it in a jar. Then I spilt it and realised I liked the sound.\u201d They stood by the bus stop where the glass had been cleaned to within an inch of its usefulness and watched a man hurry across the road carrying a cake without a box, the purest kind of risk. \u201cTomorrow the man with the ongoing haircut will ask us to do a thing in the foyer with a boom mic and we will say no with smiles and make ourselves tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow the internet will say we\u2019re in love,\u201d Maya said, cheerful because she knew facts and how to use them. \u201cWe will say that we are not and that you are married to floor and I am married to soup, and someone will draw a cartoon of you with a spoon. It will be unflattering. I will keep it for my wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow my mother will make something with tinned tomatoes and defiance,\u201d he said. \u201cMy father will put the hat on at the wrong angle. Jessa will send me a picture of an ashtray she didn\u2019t use and proclaim herself a saint. Tariq will tell a man that the shape of his head reminds him of a good story and then charge him extra for the narrative. Anya will disapprove of everything and be secretly proud. Mr. Clancy will have a peppermint. Dynamo will regard us all with horror.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we will do less,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will do so much less it will be rude.\u201d She got on the bus and found a seat and made the face she made when she was about to laugh and didn\u2019t because the driver deserved peace. She sent him a message before the bus pulled off: soup > floor, fight me, and the little typing dots on his screen were like applause he could keep in his pocket.\n\nHe walked the long way back to the house so the evening could put its hand on his shoulder and ask nothing. At home, the banner had been straightened and his mother had written the word grace on a sticky note and put it on the kettle, which was both on the nose and perfectly sensible. Lyla had found a new shade of glitter that got into your thoughts. The hinge held. The house did not make any grand claims and he did not demand any from it. He slept without rehearsing his lines for morning and dreamed he was a drum someone had put their ear to and called it music.",
