     "novel_text": "The morning the letter came, mist hung low over the canal and clung to the orange peel of streetlamps along the G\u00fcrtel. Magda Rieder stood barefoot in the tiled kitchen, one hand on the small enamel coffee pot, the other cradling a piece of stale bread, a gift from the bakery below that never closed on a weekday. Steam curled in the windowpane as if it wanted to write something. Her cat, who was not a cat by law or taxonomy but by convenience, watched the kettle with ears lifted, head cocked, thinking about heat in a way that had nothing to do with flames.\n\n\u201cA day of keys,\u201d Magda said to no one. \u201cA day for locks to notice.\u201d\n\nThe coffee bloomed in the pot with a low sound that she always thought was relief. Magda had two clocks in her kitchen: an old brass one that ran five minutes fast and a newer one that was never right for long. Between the two she\u2014more than once\u2014had made appointments happen exactly when she meant them to. Some mornings she turned both to face the wall and waited for the apartment to lose its grip on time. Those were not days for the market or the laundromat or the municipal office with its tickets and numbers gliding up digital red in orderly increments. But this was not one of those mornings. Today the clocks ticked honestly in the manner of things that thought they weren\u2019t being watched.\n\nOutside, a tram groaned, took a corner by flinging its weight around, and clattered away along the rails. A woman on her balcony across the courtyard smoked, her breath a small white ghost. Somewhere a radio squabbled in a language that had too many consonants for before nine a.m., which meant Czech or just German delivered by a man with a mouth full of pastry. Magda opened the window a sliver and slipped a sprig of winter savory onto the sill. Smoke came in, and the courtyard\u2019s cold, damp breath, and from the bakery downstairs the scent of yeast and butter and that burnt sugar bitterness that came from forgetting a tray and then pretending you meant to.\n\nHer phone buzzed with a message from Petra, who had been her friend since they were both apprentices and had mistaken a hymn for a recipe\u2014Magda never tired of that story, though Petra felt differently.\n\nG\u2019mornin, it read. Coffee later? They say she\u2019s on again tonight. Fourth time. Impossible. Except, well, you know how that word likes to slip its shoes off.\n\nMagda looked down at the coffee\u2019s oily surface, where a few bubbles were drifting in toward the center, and let her thumb hover. She could pretend to have slept through the message. That would be a way to be unkind without claiming it. Soft cruelties were a thing she had tried to learn to do without. She wrote: I saw. If it\u2019s the same she. We can watch and be irritated. At eight?\n\nPetra sent back a heart, and a gif of a woman rolling her eyes so theatrically that it should have knocked her off the chair. The cat, whose name changed often enough that it was all cats and no particular one, wound its body around Magda\u2019s ankles and purred and hummed things into the floorboards. The building took it all and gave back a small old warmth.\n\nThere were days when Magda considered going out to the canal, sitting by the water tucked into her coat, and convincing herself she was a civilian. One of those women with a novel open in one hand and a half-eaten apple in the other, the world juicy and really hers. But then the old metal letterbox lid in the hall would cluck, and she would remember the particular smell of stamped envelopes and municipal notices and the cheap ink of flyers for yoga and tax attorneys. That cluck was a kind of shiver in the skin. Today it came early. And saw another half second later, the slow slide of something heavy on old metal.\n\nShe held her coffee like a talisman and went to the door. The hallway air felt different, as if it had been instructed, a minor adjustment in humidity, a whisper of something violets were famous for. The metal lid drooped. In the shadow of the box\u2019s mouth, a rectangle, cream paper, thick as bread. The envelope waited without patience, which is to say it waited because there was no other option. She pulled it free and turned it over, and the outside of it was unmarked except for a stamp that was nothing like a stamp and a small chalk line someone had dragged across the top flap and then smudged with a finger. In the place where a return address should have been there was instead a black wax seal, and pressed into the wax: a question mark in the shape of a hooked fish. Under the curve of the question mark, a small, old, almost florid letter D.\n\nThree things happened in her body at once: her stomach sank but also rose\u2014like an elevator no one had asked for\u2014her skin cooled with a suddenness like stepping into the shadow of a bus, and the place at the base of her skull where the oldest kind of knowing lived blew open. The cat lifted its head and then laid it back down and sighed. They had known this might happen. That is to say: Magda thought she had prepared for it, and the cat had prepared to not be surprised by whatever happened.\n\nShe locked the door behind her on the corridor side, out of long habit, and went back to the kitchen. The kettle saluted her, the water ready to be coerced into tea if not coffee. She set the envelope down on the table where the damp had warped the wood and the wood had taken the message poorly. The black wax had a smell that wasn\u2019t just wax. Something sweet and rank at once, like overripe figs. It clung to the back of her throat. The seal had bled a little onto the paper. She thought of the question mark as a fish and of fish in the Danube and of the Danube swallowing things and spitting them back up on a beach in the wrong country. She thought of a studio\u2019s bright lights and a chair in which a woman had sat last week, ankles crossed neatly, dark hair pinned up with something that had belonged to her grandmother, two of the assistants having bleached their teeth too much.\n\n\u201cBrava,\u201d she said to the envelope. \u201cYou got the smell right.\u201d\n\nAre you going to open it, asked the cat in the language that is not spoken and so needs no grammar. The cat's question was a picture of the envelope\u2019s belly and the possibility of knives.\n\n\u201cI don't have to,\u201d Magda said. \u201cYou saw the seal. It\u2019s as open as anything is before it is opened.\u201d\n\nThe cat made a sound like the smallest iron bell. You will pick the wrong knife if you are too proud about it.\n\nShe brewed another small cup of coffee into a chipped demitasse and spooned a thread of dark honey into it, then set this next to the envelope like an offering left on a stoop in a fable. The steam found the black wax and made it blush; Magda watched a drop form and hover before it rolled, slow and syrupy, toward the wood. She drew a circle with her index finger around the cup and the letter, then another, thinking the words that had taught her not to say them out loud. The first circle was for the place; the second was for the old things that cared about place. In the way a humble circle drawn with breath and intent can be.\n\nAnd then\u2014of course\u2014she opened it. Not with a knife, after all. With her thumb, pressed into the wax\u2019s black and under it a thin layer of something that clung like sleep to eyelashes. The paper tore with the sort of sound that makes ink stand up and pay attention. Inside, a single sheet, thick but not as thick as it pretended to be. The handwriting was done by a person who had made a private study of angles and pressure, and of the way old feuds need a particular slant to how they\u2019re announced.\n\nHonored Magda Rieder, it began. By the right of public oath and by the privilege of contest held in the old municipalities and yet in the new media, I extend you invitation. The letters stood up and dipped in a rhythm that wasn\u2019t European. It pulled from a little bit of everywhere because some people think that makes them universal.\n\nUnder that, the details. The among lines and the officiants and the conditions of refusal, which were none in the old ways and worse in the new. The place was named and then named again to remove the possibility of error: at the Prater\u2019s edge, under the big wheel, cabin seven, at the eighth turn after eight bells on the eighth day from this. There is a way to write eight where it looks like a snake chewing its own tail, and she had done that. And then the name of the sender in an even darker ink as if Part of her wanted it to be tattooed on the reader\u2019s eye. Zita Dorn. The stage name screamed with modesty\u2014because modesty is a rival you never really meant to invite. Under it, in parentheses, smaller and sullen: registered as Dorner, Zita Maria, of Favoriten, formerly of Leoben, citizenship confirmed in 2009, identification issued at- It trailed off as if bored with itself. Someone had written these lower things for the benefit of the ordinary authorities, because there are always ordinary authorities, even here.\n\nThe black question mark seal on the back of the envelope was the question mark she had worn last week at her throat like a cheap charm. It had glimmered on the television light and said nothing and said everything. The quiz show had been called Who Is the Queen When There Are No Kings. Petra had sent three angry texts at different points during the broadcast, full of rhetorical fireworks. Magda had watched too, her lips pressed so tightly together she had tasted salt. The game\u2019s host was a man with a mouth like a smile that someone had pulled across a surface with a finger wet with oil. He had spoken to Zita as if the two of them had known all along that she would win. And she had won. Of course she had. There had been a question about the most obscure species of cave salamander in Eastern Europe. A question about an eighteenth-century land register for a small patch of orchard two hours south of here. A question about a saint who had been invented. Zita had answered with a confidence that would have been arrogance if it had been human. And the lights had turned her hair into a night no one had ever really been in.\n\n\u201cShe cheats,\u201d Petra had said aloud, from the couch where she\u2019d left her coat on as if that would cut her losses. \u201cNot a little. Not elegantly. She picks the whole system up like a rug and shakes it until all the dust is her name.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to cheat,\u201d Magda had said, not because it was true but because some sentences are muscle memory. \u201cShe can\u2019t resist being that way. It isn\u2019t just winning, it\u2019s winning in a way that makes the rules blush.\u201d\n\nPetra had snorted. \u201cSo, that\u2019s good then: we\u2019re dealing with a poet who also does receipts.\u201d\n\nThey had laughed then, or something like it, with the thin knobble of fear at the back of their mouths. And later, when the show had ended with music that wanted to be a parade but had forgotten its costume, Petra had left for the tram with three pretzels tucked into her bag, two for the journey and one for her father who thought he loved salt and in truth salt had been politely tolerating him for years.\n\nBut the laughter was not here now. Zita\u2019s letter lay on the kitchen table like a stone that had been given a pen to hold. The words had weight. Not just symbolic weight, the kind that could be conjured away by wit. The kind that pulled on everything around it like a gravity and a law at once. The cat touched the envelope with one paw, very lightly, as if it was a pond and might ripple.\n\n\u201cBattle?\u201d the cat said, perverse. We still call it battle?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the word she chose.\u201d Magda fingered the shape of the eight on the page and felt it hum. \u201cBattle is old. It makes people think of shields. Better than duel. Duel attracts the wrong kind of attention in this country. Duel makes men who wore swords to dances feel invited.\u201d\n\nYou can decline, the cat offered, knowing that this was more of a thought than a possibility. You can cast your lot into a hat and draw out a different life and insist it\u2019s your own. You can refuse anyone who invites you to bleed for someone else\u2019s ratings.\n\n\u201cShe has linked it to the oath,\u201d Magda said. \u201cYou see that. She framed it. She wants the kind of crowd that comes when someone says there will be an official thing with old papers under it. You know what they\u2019re like. They bring sandwiches and lawn chairs. They bring portable applause.\u201d\n\nThe cat slid onto the chair and stared at her until she looked away. The old oath had been many things. It had been a promise made when the country was the world's expert in mixed messages and empire. It had been reformulated when the country fell apart and then claimed itself again with a smaller table. It had been a way to ensure that disputes would not bleed into the city\u2019s ordinary blood. If you had a quarrel that could not be left to rot on its own, you could bring it under the mechanical protection of a spectacle. So people would think it was about fame or entertainment. And the real thing could hide there, less likely to attract the kinds of curiosity that brought in knives you hadn\u2019t counted on.\n\nIn the next building, someone dropped a pan. The sound made its way through the courtyard like a bird that had forgotten how to navigate. Magda folded the letter and then unfolded it, as if that would change the ink\u2019s set.\n\nAfter breakfast, Magda set about her work. Work is a word that wears a lot of hands. In her case it was translating\u2014people brought her things written in the wrong century, and she persuaded them into the present. It was also consultation for those whose wrong things had turned themselves into consequences. Once she had unwound the plagues from a jar of jam that had been mislabeled by a mother-in-law who meant it to be preserves and not a curse. She went to a courtyard off Lerchenfelder Stra\u00dfe to pour three pails of dark poppy seed along a crack in the stone, because the crack had something to say and could not get a word in otherwise. She visited an old woman downstairs who made schnapps in her bathtub and who had seen in the steamy mirror the face of a boy she had loved in 1944, which had not been as romantic as it sounded. The woman asked Magda to dismiss the boy with kindness. Magda did and then took a small bottle of schnapps anyway, because kindness is not incompatible with collecting your fee in a reasonable form.\n\nBy midday, the sky over the city was a uniform white and the light was returning from everything it touched. She drank soup out of a mug, and the spoon slipped and clanged in a way that suggested a symbol if you were inclined to collect those. Petra sent another message. omg did you see. of course you did. come here if you want to watch me swear before dinner. i have beer. Also a cheese with a rind that frightens me and might have to be negotiated with.\n\nMagda typed: Eight o\u2019clock, your place, I\u2019ll bring bread and olives. Have you got garlic? And then she didn\u2019t send it, because the afternoon had taken a turn and seemed to be listening. That was foolish, to ascribe intent to an afternoon. But foolishness is also a language, and sometimes it makes a kind of sense that logic doesn\u2019t have pockets big enough to carry.\n\nShe opened her laptop and then closed it and then opened it again. She looked up Zita Dorn. It was always a mistake to look too long at the faces of those who would become your enemy; they got into the grooves in your eyes and lived there. But not looking at a problem makes it less like a problem and more like an animal behind a thin, damp curtain. Zita\u2019s official page opened in a crisp white. Photographs in which she wore red. Interviews from two years ago where her voice was soft and pilgrim-bright. A clip in which she was laughing, her hand on the host\u2019s wrist as if to keep him from leaving his job. Rumors in forums, the kind that have users with names like ppatience_1968 and bigwolfvienna. One forum thread began: Did you see how she looked left before the salamander question? Classic sign someone was whispering through the wires. Another: She went to that school, you know. The one with the flag that doesn\u2019t have a country. The one that teaches you to climb on roofs and talk to statues. The one that says publicly we share everything and privately we take.\n\nMagda clicked and clicked and then stopped and rinsed her hands under the tap and felt the water change as it hit her skin, temperature an anecdote told to different fingers with different emphases. She thought about the time in the archive when a voice had spoken as if in a photograph, just a mouth with no face. She thought about the way some people learned to use a crowd as a cloak. She thought about the letter with its black wax seal and the old-fashioned phrase that had no particular allegiance: I extend you invitation.\n\nHow strange to be singled out by someone who preferred rooms with two hundred chairs made from one idea to rooms with a kitchen table she had done her taxes on three years running. How strange to be the person she had this week chosen, as if she had reached into a bowl and pulled a name that had been chewed.\n\nAt four, the bells from a nearby church rang with the frenzy that always made her think of the bells practicing becoming themselves. Magda watched a man on the opposite balcony water a plant with leaves like little silver spoons. He had three rings in his left ear and moved as if gravity was offering him polite suggestions.\n\nShe called Petra. \u201cI recieved something,\u201d she said, and winced at the way the wrong letter in the word made the sentence feel truer. \u201cI received something. Both. From her.\u201d\n\nPetra inhaled in obvious italics. \u201cA cake? A bomb? A bouquet that leans the wrong way?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn invitation. There is a seal. There is the number eight drawn like a serpent and the Prater wheel and cabin seven. She\u2019s invoking the oath. She wants\u2014\u201d She stopped. It was always difficult to tell where wanting ended and insisting began in a person like Zita.\n\n\u201cWe knew she would do this, Mags,\u201d Petra said, voice practical in the way of a person who almost believed in pragmatism. \u201cYou told me last week\u2014when she took the TV money from a question no one should have any business knowing\u2014that she was making a shape. And you were right. She thinks she\u2019s building a new stage, and we all must come in through the trapdoor.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretend to be a fool. Let her underestimate you. Wear a scarf that says you don\u2019t have a plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never worn a scarf that says anything. That\u2019s your trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring the garlic,\u201d Petra said. \u201cAnd a small knife. And a larger one. And the book with the pages that go blank unless you hold it over steam. And Bruno\u2019s left shoe. He swears it\u2019s lucky and I long to be rid of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will do none of those things,\u201d Magda said. And they laughed, though in both their throats a piece of winter took up residence and refused to leave.\n\nAfter they hung up, Magda took the envelope and the letter and the cup with sticky honey on its lip to the sink. She washed the cup with casual care and the envelope with meticulous disinterest. You never knew what lurked in glue. She dried her hands on the towel that had once been a shirt. Then she went to the tall bookcase in the corner of the living room, where the bottom two shelves were as haunted as cupboards could be without frightening the resident children. She pulled down a book about the old laws of the city, the ones etched in granite and in floorboards and in people\u2019s mouths. The page for the oath of contests crackled when she opened it, as if someone\u2019s hands had been there not long ago. There were notes in the margin written in a neat unsentimental script, her teacher\u2019s hand, she would know it anywhere. A sentence bloomed in the margin like mold: If you must go, bring a person who loves you and wants you to win, not a person who loves winning and wants you to be their instrument.\n\nMagda closed the book gently and looked at the cat. \u201cYou don\u2019t love me.\u201d\n\nThe cat blinked. I am not made of love or hate. I am made of the little pieces of noise at the edges of both. But I want you to live, because living is interesting, and because you have learned how to heat milk without scalding it. Also you arrange cushions in a way that benefits me.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Magda said. \u201cYou are, as always, balm.\u201d\n\nShe set the book back and took down another, a thinner one stitched in blue thread. The list inside was her list, kept too long and with too much care. How to prepare for a public duel in a private city. Things to bring. Things to leave behind. She had written it when she was twenty and had thought she knew where the edges were. She read the items as if they belonged to another person and decided that the other person had not been entirely a fool.\n\nWhen evening came, she took bread and olives in a paper bag and walked to Petra\u2019s, because the tram was late and she had energy to spend. The sidewalks had that gloss that happens when the day freezes back into itself. People were wrapped in their coats and in their voices, talking about the football match, about their mother\u2019s elbow, about the number of tourists at the cathedral this afternoon. Three children chased a half-deflated ball, which made a sound like a curse every time someone\u2019s foot nicked it just so. At the corner, a man with a portable radio held it up so that everyone passing would hear the news and perhaps buy one of the wallets he had laid out on a blanket that had seen\u2014better days, worse days.\n\nPetra lived on the third floor of a building with a lift that had opinions about mass. Her hair was pulled up with a pencil. She opened the door as if she had been waiting for an hour, and likely she had, likely she had been pretending to rearrange a shelf while listening with her whole skin for footsteps. They embraced in the doorway without the ceremony of hello.\n\n\u201cI brought brine,\u201d Magda said. \u201cAnd three kinds of foolishness. They may be indistinguishable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have beer,\u201d Petra said, leading her into the kitchen where a slim TV perched on a stool as if it were a pet that had chosen that spot. \u201cAnd a cheese with a rind that looks like something the forest did after thinking about it too much.\u201d\n\nThey arranged the food as if a little ritual had been promised and would be delivered. They didn\u2019t talk about the letter right away. They were both old enough to allow joy to go first into the room whenever it broke in late.\n\nThe program started with a jingle, silly and knowing. The host came out in a blue suit the shade of tile in pools that are heated a little too much. He grinned the way some buildings lean. The audience clapped as if somebody had pressed a button, which someone had. The first contestant looked like a person who knew how to calibrate instruments on an airplane and was at peace with that. The second was an old woman whose smile could have sold knives. The third was Zita.\n\nShe wore black, the simplest kind, the kind that swallowed the definition around it. Her hands were ringless except for one thin band of metal on her left thumb. On the thumb\u2019s band: engraved, the tiny fish-shaped question mark. Her hair was pinned back with tiny red lacquered clips that would have looked like clownfish if anyone had been close enough to say so. Her mouth was not a wound or a promise; it was something else, and Magda had learned a long time ago that not every mouth had a metaphor that could be fetched like a dog.\n\nThe game unspooled with the precision of something that had been drilled until it had become muscle. Zita answered in a voice that had been taught to be both modest and inexorable. She did a demure smile after a particularly implausible question\u2014the kind of smile that said even the air was on her side. Petra swore in long strings under her breath, as she had promised, in a dialect that belonged to a village that had only ever existed when her father sang.\n\nThey watched until the beer was warm and the bread was gone and the olives were only pits and brine. \u201cShe\u2019s moving the line,\u201d Petra said when the credits at last climbed the screen. \u201cThere\u2019s what\u2019s allowed, and there\u2019s what you can get away with, and there\u2019s what becomes the new allowed because no one grabbed your wrist when they should have.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s also having the time of her life,\u201d Magda said. Sometimes that mattered. Mostly it made people cruel. Power is bored by those who aren\u2019t having fun. That was a rule she had found written on a wall once, and she had remembered it because it had been written in handwriting that looked like laughter attempting arithmetic.\n\n\u201cI hate the way she looks into the lens as if choosing someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was,\u201d said Magda, and the kitchen fell out of its chair for a second. \u201cShe chose me this morning.\u201d\n\nPetra put her elbows on the table and used her big hands to hold her face up so that feeling could have somewhere to happen. \u201cWe will write a letter back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will make it formal. We will use phrases that make anyone reading cough and say the word custom with hatred. We will remind her that just because a thing is a spectacle doesn\u2019t a make it a carnival. We will-\u201d She ran out of will.\n\n\u201cWe will go to the Prater,\u201d Magda said softly. \u201cOn the eighth day. Because she has used the oath and the wires.\u201d\n\nPetra looked down at the table. There were small rings of oil where the olives had been. The rings had arranged themselves into a symbol Magda recognized and decided to forget immediately. \u201cYou do not have to do this alone,\u201d Petra said.\n\n\u201cThe law says bring no one. You know it. The public is the witness. The cabin itself is the officiant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will not go. You will invoke some exception written in that book with confusing marginalia.\u201d\n\nMagda shook her head. \u201cIf I decline, she will make meals out of that. She will cook me with the idea of me. She will say: The people who owe you keenness are not keen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we send someone else. Someone who has no skin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are short on friendless ghosts this week. I checked the rota.\u201d She smiled and then didn\u2019t.\n\nPetra reached across the table and took Magda\u2019s hand. The kitchen performed its trick of being the whole world. \u201cListen to me,\u201d she said, voice a riverbed. \u201cWin or lose, hon-\u201d She stopped herself. Names acquire talons when you load them with hope. \u201cWe know what she is. We know what you are. You are not a fair person, Magda. I mean that as praise. You are not too fair to survive out there. But you are the kind of honest that has teeth. She will not have counted on that.\u201d\n\nMagda squeezed Petra\u2019s fingers. The knuckles had a map printed on them, of every year\u2019s winter. \u201cI will write her back,\u201d she said. \u201cI will accept.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will eat a slice of cheese for courage, even though the rind is telling me it has seen things, and those things were late and worrying.\u201d\n\nMagda laughed, and then a kind of fog lifted. She did eat the cheese. It tasted like the inside of a bell. She tasted iron and memory and the way cows in summer stand under trees and consider what shade is. The beer had gone flat and warm, but she drank it anyway because rituals like to be completed even in small ways.\n\nShe walked home under a sky that had decided to be starred. It was not a showy decision. The stars were more like a rumor, pinholes in the cloud where someone had pressed hard with a needle. At the Prater the giant wheel was a half-moon of lights in the distance, a necklace someone had taken off and hung on a nail. Cabin seven. Eighth turn. Eight bells. She tried not to do math with it. She tried not to make it into a nursery rhyme. She tried not to be thirteen again, telling herself that if she turned twice and then didn\u2019t look down when crossing the bridge she would keep her mother living one more year. She tried not to remember the smell of the hospital, that lemon disinfectant and between it something that no one talks about.\n\nBack in her kitchen, she took paper and a pen that had belonged to a man she had gone to bed with three times and then never called again because sometimes kindness is knowing when you should be selfish. She wrote:\n\nTo Zita Dorner, of whomever and what place.\n\nI received your letter. I accept your conditions, because they are mine too, because we live here, because the bell rings the whole city whether you thought to or not. The Prater. Cabin seven. The eighth turn after eight bells. The witnesses will come and all their eyes will be mouths.\n\nI will come with what I am. No more, no less. I trust you will too, despite your habit of collecting extra pockets.\n\nA small drawing bloomed at the bottom of the page without her having decided to. It was a fishhook bent into a question mark, and under it she drew a straight pin. They were two letters, if letters could be forged.\n\nShe sealed the letter with candle wax because she had run out of the black kind years ago and because using red would be a waste. She resisted the urge to put anything else in there with it. A pinch of salt. A clipping. A hair. Resisted and then changed her mind and slid in three mustard seeds because sometimes love is making sure you can recognize your own letter if someone decides to toss it into a pile.\n\nAt the door she hesitated. The mailbox? The post? The small boy with the large ears who was always sitting on the steps trying to sell someone a tiny painted soldier from his grandfather\u2019s cupboard? In the end she set it in the general outbox to the underworld, which is to say she slid it into the crack between the lift and the world and listened until a roll and a sigh told her it had gone to the place where such letters go.\n\nShe slept badly. Dreams came that pretended to be useful but were really advertisements. In one, she was in the quiz show chair, and questions rose around her like bubbles, and instead of answering she reached out and popped them one by one. In another, she and Petra were children, throwing rocks at a wheel because it wouldn\u2019t stop turning. In the last, the letter became a bird and pecked her ear until she bled black wax.\n\nIn the pale morning she woke to the sound of a bicycle bell. The cat had discovered a way to look offended and innocent at once. There was flour on the table from nowhere, and on the flour a thin line as if a finger had written a word and then erased it. She made coffee with hands that were steadier than they felt.\n\nEight days. That was long enough to teach a muscle a new trick. That was not long enough to become a new animal. She would practice how to stand in a cabin that moved and made motion a rule. She would practice how to answer questions with her eyes. She would practice how to hand back a cheat. She would practice; then she would improvise; then she would choose when to be selfish.\n\nOn the second day a small box came to her from a woman she did not know, the kind of stranger whose mouth makes strangers into neighbors before they have earned it. Inside the box, a deck of cards with no faces. You drew a card and the blanched surface said something you had meant to say yourself. On the third day, the woman downstairs asked for her schnapps back because she had a date with someone as old as she, and nerves required fortification. On the fourth day, a child on the street ran past Magda with arms extended and whispered, as if reciting, \u201cCabin seven.\u201d Children pick up things with their ears and then carry them across town because they have pockets that don\u2019t stay empty. On the fifth day, the quiz show did a special episode where no one won and the audience was asked to stand and applaud randomness. On the sixth day, a crow landed on Magda\u2019s windowsill with a bottlecap in its beak, and she took it and set down a piece of the cheese rind, and the exchange was good and made them both think better of the world. On the seventh day, it snowed.\n\nSnow in Vienna is a complicated moment. It is both romance and complaint. It is both an opera and a line at the bakery. Magda watched it fall as if the city had decided to be dandruff. The cat pawed at the flakes where the window was warm and the cold made them elaborate. Magda took out her old coat, the one with the pockets she had once hidden a field in. She whispered to it, and it whispered back with the sound of moths changing their minds.\n\nOn the eighth day, Petra came at seven in the evening. They had made no plan to meet. They had always made the same plan without making it. When a person you love is going to be deliberate with danger, you hold their coat while they put their arms in. Petra braided Magda\u2019s hair as if it was a rope they would both climb. She put something into the braid that glittered with a specific temperance. It didn\u2019t matter what it was. It mattered that Petra\u2019s hands had done it.\n\n\u201cWe are going to a fair,\u201d Petra said, voice so wry you could have sharpened a knife on it.\n\n\u201cWe are,\u201d Magda said. \u201cA very old fair where once men bought prizes made of glass and pretended they were immortal.\u201d\n\nThey walked. The cold held them in both its hands and squeezed gently, as if trying to figure out how they fit. The paths into the Prater were dark in the way that cities make, light pooled in the wrong places, shadows doing creative work between. The wheel rose ahead. Cabin seven was not magic; it was a wooden box with windows and hinges that had known every kind of weather. There were people there already, of course. People who had brought their winter hats with pompoms and their phones and their whispered verdicts. Spectacle, always, had babysitters and bystanders, and they did their jobs with varying degrees of professionalism.\n\nA woman with a clipboard and a lanyard, the natural predator of the Vienna bureaucrat, approached. \u201cNames,\u201d she said aloud. She looked at Petra, at Magda, at the cat now nowhere, because the cat had other plans that did not involve being counted.\n\n\u201cMagda Rieder,\u201d Magda said, and the woman\u2019s pen skipped briefly as if it had learned the name in another life and had to exert itself to write it properly.\n\n\u201cContestant,\u201d the woman said, checking a box. First word: small, second word: big. Then her eyes moved right and left, eyes that had mastered the universal code of either I'm bored or I am extremely alert and would prefer you not know it. \u201cYou know the rules,\u201d she added, without kindness and without threat. It was the tone of a tram driver at midnight who has seen two hundred variations of the same problem and expects nothing except someone to stand too near the door.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Magda said. \u201cI know all the rules, even the ones you won\u2019t say out loud because they partly belong to the ground we are standing on.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded as if that was a correct answer. She pointed to cabin number seven with a pen that had the show\u2019s name printed on it. Someone had covered the name with tape. It was supposed to be anonymous; that was the fiction, anyway. Zita stood a little apart, wearing a coat that looked like an argument made into fabric. Her face was turned up to the wheel as if she were saying grace. When she saw Magda, she smiled with just her teeth. The smile made it clear she\u2019d eaten something no one had offered her.\n\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d Zita said to the air. \u201cWe are all here. The list can relax; the night can begin.\u201d Her eyes flicked to Petra and then away, as if to say: I have chosen our positions; you will stand where I put you in my thinking. Petra folded her big arms and made the statue of an angel that guards bridges.\n\nPeople moved as they were told to move by signs and by the choreography of crowds who have seen other crowds and learned those dances. The bell in the clock near the carousel began to ring. Eight, with the kind of measured certainty that was a prompt and a prayer. The wheel creaked as the operator, who had seen more nights than rules, set it in motion. Cabin seven opened its mouth.\n\nIt was warmer inside than Magda expected. There was a winter\u2019s worth of breath caught in the wood. The windows were clean in the careless city way\u2014someone had considered washing them and then been interrupted by an old man telling the story of a thing he had seen here when he was a boy, which had not been a true thing but had been told and told until it had the privileges of truth.\n\nZita stood across from her, the cabin closing them into a slice of the sky. There were no chairs. There was no host with a grin. There were two microphones installed late and a camera eye set into the corner like a fly too well-fed to buzz. The city fell away beneath them in a slow, inevitable drop. The wheel took its first turn.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d Zita said softly, to Magda, and to the camera, and to the bell as it finished singing and took a breath. \u201cFinally.\u201d\n\nMagda said: \u201cI would have preferred to meet in a kitchen.\u201d She let the words be plain. She let them go without their armor. \u201cBut of course kitchens are not where you gather power these days, are they.\u201d\n\nZita laughed and turned her head slightly so that a lock of hair fell like a poet\u2019s first metaphor. \u201cOh, kitchens still matter,\u201d she said. \u201cMen fear them because they cannot control them. That hasn\u2019t changed. But yes. I prefer the circles that people draw by accident when they sit with their mouths open. I like to be in there when the mouth makes shapes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cheat,\u201d Magda said.\n\nZita\u2019s lips parted in a small oh that was neither surprise nor offense. \u201cCheat is a word made by people who were late to breakfast and want to own lunch. I take the thing you take and I carry it better because I don\u2019t apologize while I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the show,\u201d Magda said. \u201cNames matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen say mine with the old pronunciation,\u201d Zita said. She leaned closer as the cabin rocked and righted. \u201cSay it like you know where the letter belongs in your throat. Say it like you met a woman on a road and took her hand and told her it wasn\u2019t her fault she loved winning. Say Zita Dorner, of no one and everywhere. Say it and then show me your pockets, Magda Rieder. The audience adores pocket checks.\u201d\n\nThe wheel rose, and the city beneath them widened. The Danube lay like a promise in the distance, and the buildings were a chessboard that had mislaid four pieces and pretended not to notice. A small boy waved at the cabin from below, a red hat in a moving crowd.\n\nMagda took a breath and let it out. She spoke then in the old way, the way that promised both spectacle and law, words that had been smoothed by tongues long dead. Her mouth was dry. Her knees were steady. Zita listened with her head tilted as if an unfamiliar bird had settled on the windowsill and begun to speak politics.\n\nWhen the first question came, it came from the speaker in the ceiling, the voice that had held the show together for weeks. It asked something about a crown and a year and a piece of parchment that had considered itself the boss of people who did not consent to be bossed. Zita\u2019s eyes flicked left in that little way that meant someone elsewhere had not been disciplined in their desire to help. Magda watched the flick and felt a movement in her own skull, something like a coin slid under a shell in a game that had never once been fair, and she did not reach to move it. She waited, and then she spoke, and the word she said was the wrong answer on purpose, because sometimes you win by moving the circle a little bit away and making the other person step where there is no floor.\n\nThe cabin lifted. The city did not care that it held them. The camera eye watched and did not blink. The wheel went around once as if testing both of them, and then went around again, and Magda realized that the night had teeth, and she was in its mouth, and the only way out was either through the tongue\u2019s kindness or by becoming something even a mouth could not quite manage to hold. She smiled without showing her teeth, which is to say she looked like herself entirely. And downstairs, in the cold, Petra looked up and folded her arms and sent a thought that did not need a grammar to be understood: Do not let her rearrange the furniture inside you. Keep the table where we put it. Keep the knives where they hang. Keep the salt in a pinchable place.\n\nThe wheel took its eighth bell as if bells could be counted by mechanical grace and by blood at once. The city shifted its consciousness in small ways; people who had not planned to turn their heads turned them. Though the cabin was a room and the room was ordinary, though the air was thin and smelled of paint and old cedar and winter, though laws were being invoked and eyes were being fed, there was a moment when Magda could have sworn the sky itself leaned in to see. That might have been a trick of the wheel. It might have been Zita\u2019s doing. It might have been exactly what it felt like: the world noticing, briefly, that someone had come to battle with both hands open and their pockets empty but full of other things entirely.The first answer laid itself down like a playing card that meant nothing by itself and everything in sequence. A small light by the camera changed color, the kind of meek red that means both recording and apology. Somewhere under their feet a relay accepted the error and carried it away on its little back. Zita\u2019s mouth made a shape it had rehearsed for wrongness\u2014sweet surprise, and a microsecond of pity\u2014then let it fall. Magda kept her gaze fixed on the seam where the window met the wood. A smudge there had the exact shape of a fingerprint, or of a country that had been erased from a schoolbook and kept lingering on children\u2019s tongues anyway. The voice in the ceiling cleared its throat with the expensive sound of something that had been told not to cough and did so with gravitas instead. The wheel groaned; the people below became smaller and better behaved; and the cabin crossed a corner of the sky where clouds had left a thumbprint too.\n\n\u201cSecond,\u201d said the voice, and this time it carried the crisp new-paper smell of a question that wanted to be respected by people who had learned to frown over their coffee. \u201cWhen the rights of contest are invoked under municipal ordinance 18, subsection c, what advantage is afforded the petitioner in the matter of scope?\u201d The language had the smugness of a clerk who has never once spilled ink. Zita\u2019s eyes did the little flick that had enraged the forums. It was so tiny that it could have been a blink taught better manners. Magda exhaled slowly until the window fogged, then lifted her hand and wrote a letter there that was not a letter, the arc of a circle begun and not completed, a sentence friendlier than punctuation. In the fog, the question was visible the way breath sometimes makes visible the thing the air had been trying to say without lips. \u201cScope is a kind of famine,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you say scope, you mean the right to choose the field and the instruments, and the petitioner is granted the choosing so long as they declare the extent in public. The advantage is theater. The advantage is called a crowd.\u201d She did not say c. She did not say ordinance. She said the words that belonged to the floorboards.\n\n\u201cIt is more technical than that,\u201d Zita murmured, eyes still soft, voice for the camera\u2019s sake a little breathless as if the altitude had been wheedling her. \u201cIt is measured. We measure it. We make it measurable. That\u2019s what it means to live like this instead of in the weather.\u201d The light shifted behind her and turned the coast of her cheek into something a painter would later misremember as devotion. \u201cScope means my hand gets the compass and yours gets the pencil.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you set the radius,\u201d Magda said, because letting someone else name the length of a circle is the fastest way to be walked in. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the floor knows where the nails are.\u201d She tapped the wood with the toe of her boot. Once, twice, and then once again in time with the sound the city makes when a tram\u2019s wheels hit a defect in the rail and decide to make poetry out of it. The voice accepted her answer because it had to\u2014the old languages, when spoken with the right temper, obliged the new mechanisms to dress themselves in different clothes. Outside, the wheel found the top of itself and did what tops do: noticed the falling.\n\nThird came dressed in the innocent clothes of biography, the kind you buy in a stationer\u2019s shop where the owner keeps an old dog under the till. \u201cGive the derivation of your name,\u201d the voice said, with a friendliness that had been calculated, and somewhere below several people turned to each other and did the thing crowds do when invited to feel the intimacy of someone else\u2019s history. Zita looked delighted. She had told this story already on late-night radio, had told it with a little choke of throat, had named a grandmother\u2019s kitchen, had described a child, herself, insisting that she would not be a Maria because Maria was a wall in a church and she wanted to be a doorway. Magda could feel Petra\u2019s disapproval like a warmed coin in a pocket; naming is old magic, and hearing someone do it prettily for strangers is like watching a child sell her hair to a man who promises a wig. \u201cI was Magda for a woman who had no children and a lot of violets,\u201d she said before Zita could speak. \u201cRieder because somebody liked the way the sound leaned. The papers will tell you another thing and they won\u2019t be wrong, but papers never bent down to pick up a dropped spoon, so I don\u2019t take their word as the only word. The derivation is this: a woman in a market put a hand on my head when I was an infant and said, That one is stubborn, and stubborn walks like Magda. And my mother, who had damaged a dictionary once and never trusted reference after that, said, Yes.\u201d She let the story sit there, not because it was a shield but because it had weight and weight is often a better defense than sharpness. Zita\u2019s lips tightened in a way that was elegant if you did not know what it meant to want to be the only person who knows how to turn a key.\n\nThe wheel passed a strut white with frost. The cabin, as if in sympathy, gave a small semitone of complaint that might have been wood asking for oil or might have been old rules asking for courtesy. Between the spokes, the city flipped its pages, each square of light in an apartment a chapter in a bad or excellent novel. Magda pressed her fingers together and felt the small buzz she had trained herself to notice when wires brought whispers. It came from the corner behind Zita, thin as the idea of sugar in coffee ordered black. She looked not at Zita but at the little metal plate by the ceiling where the microphone had been bolted after some meeting where a man said words like deliverable and activation. There is a clause, she remembered, that says the air must be unowned during a contest. It is not called that exactly in the book, because the old book lets you pretend that the air belongs to no one without stating plainly that anyone who tries to own it must be slapped in public. \u201cBreathe with me,\u201d she said suddenly, not to the woman across from her but to the glass. She drew a circle again with her breath and finished it this time. Below, Petra must have felt the draft of the thought because she took in a breath so large that three people near her turned to see if she had been startled by a ghost. A moment later one of the attendants reached up on the outside of the cabin and slid a latch, old-fashioned and unapologetic. A window opened the width of a palm. Air came in that had been out of doors long enough to forget the rules. Zita frowned. Her shoulder twitched. The flick to the left looked less like a twitch and more like an unpracticed shrug. The whisper line suffered, which is to say it met weather and did not like it.\n\nThe next question wanted to sound ancient, but it had a stain where you could see the modernity had bled through. \u201cName,\u201d the voice said, and the microphone seemed to enjoy the sound of the single syllable so much that it stretched it out like dough. \u201cName the patron saint of false witnesses unmasked.\u201d A murmur went up from below from those who had watched the episode where a saint had been invented and then paraded past people who needed to believe in something convenient. Zita\u2019s smile snapped into place with the tidy cruelty of a clasp. \u201cLudmila of the Latch,\u201d she said, because she had given the saint that nickname herself and had dressed a statue in a film of approval and sugared curiosity. \u201cShe\u2019s not real,\u201d she added, smiling to the camera as if she were being generous. \u201cBut neither is the difference between truth and proof when the room is watched closely enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no saint,\u201d Magda said, \u201cbut there is a street where someone has painted a door that opens only when the weather wants you to go through.\u201d She had seen it last year, off Neustiftgasse, where the houses lean in to listen to men in hats talking about football and sorrow. \u201cIf you stand there and ask to be allowed, an old woman will tell you if you deserve it. If you lie, she will laugh until the lie falls out of your ear and lands on the pavement to be stepped on by a passing tourist. That\u2019s who you are talking about and you know it. Don\u2019t pour sugar on it and call it holy.\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant to be unkind, but sometimes a sentence comes wearing boots. Zita\u2019s eyes cooled. \u201cIncorrect,\u201d said the voice from the ceiling, not because it was wrong\u2014streets require faith\u2014but because the apparatus had no way to register a thing that was not carved on paper at City Hall. \u201cAccepted,\u201d said the wheel beneath them, because the wood remembered more than the ordinance.\n\nTurn two fell away and turned to three. The cabin did its little forward-hinged bow to gravity each time it crossed the top. Magda thought of the mustard seeds she had slid into her envelope and wondered if they had found their way into a pocket near here and if they were doing what seeds do best: being patient and waiting to be asked. Zita shifted her weight and the coat she wore made a very soft sound, like silk being reminded of a past life. \u201cDo you know,\u201d Zita said conversationally, as if they were two women in a queue and not two people teaching a wheel a lesson, \u201cthe first time I lied on purpose? I mean in the way you object to, where the lie is a tool, not a color? I told a teacher that I had hurt my hand so I couldn\u2019t write, and she let me speak. I liked speaking. I liked it so much I learned to hurt what was in the way of it.\u201d She said it as if it were gospel. The camera drank her face. The people below, who had not come for a confession but would settle for anything fed to them with confidence, leaned closer without moving. \u201cThat is not a question,\u201d Magda said. \u201cIt is the right shape to be a question if you shaved two pieces off and tilted it a little to the left, but it is not one. Are you allowed to ask me to admire you in the middle of the law?\u201d She put a small smile on the side of her mouth where jealousy sometimes sits; she offered that smile to the wood of the cabin rather than to the woman.\n\nThe voice went on, dutiful as a man with a tray of drinks. \u201cUnder the older formulations, contestants may each proffer a question once, under seal.\u201d The word seal made both of them look, involuntarily, at the place in the letter where the black wax had pretended to be old. Magda felt a prickle along her forearms, as if a choir of bureaucrats had cleared their throats in unison. She had been saving her one. In her pocket someone else\u2019s pen was warm. She could feel Petra\u2019s hands in her hair pulling through the braid and tucking in the small glittering thing that did not matter and also mattered a great deal; the glitter was a piece of broken glass taken from the floor of a hotel where a different contest had gone wrong; it was a reminder and a compass both. \u201cI proffer,\u201d she said, and the wheel hummed a little differently because a proffer is an old word and pleased a mechanism that had once been maintained by men with cigarette ash under their nails. \u201cMy question is for the officiant.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot\u2014\u201d said Zita, which was a way of saying she did not like to be asked to share authority with an object. \u201cI can,\u201d Magda said gently, \u201cbecause the officiant is a thing that notices. We agreed to that when we chose this place. The giant wheel belongs to the city because everyone owes it a small piece of their childhood and their fear of height. That\u2019s the legal phrasing under the paint.\u201d She put her hand flat against the wood. It was warmer than she expected, as if a thousand winter hands had left kindness there. \u201cOfficiant, ask.\u201d She made of the word not an order but an invitation like the ones she had been taught to write on the breath so that old stones would feel included.\n\nIt took a second. Machines, even old ones, have pride and do not like to be hurried into intimacy. The voice from the ceiling tried to speak and then did not. The camera tried to tilt and then did not. A small change came through the floor, as if the axle had shifted its thought from rotation to attention. The question rose through the wood like sap. \u201cWhat do you owe me,\u201d asked the wheel, and its voice was not a voice but a sound she recognized from summers when the metal had been hot enough to smell. \u201cWhat do you owe to the thing that holds you up while pretending to let you fly? Say what you owe honestly.\u201d It was not poetry; it was not legal; it was the kind of question that refuses to be arraigned by cleverness. Zita\u2019s mouth opened and then closed. Magda could feel heat behind her own eyes and in the angle of her jaw. She thought about the day her father had lifted her into a cabin and she had decided to be brave because he hated that she was frightened and she loved him in the complicated way children love people who want them to be different. She thought of climbing higher than she could justify in a courtyard once, up iron that rusted on her palms, and how the view from the clothesline had made her both generous and petty at once.\n\n\u201cI owe you my balance,\u201d she said to the wheel in a voice that felt like the first swallow of a winter drink made of spices and apology. \u201cI owe you the grit under my boot. I owe you not to throw anything over the side and call that letting go. I owe you to know the difference between floating and being carried. I owe you thanks for the moment when you go slow at the top to make a child feel like God.\u201d She had not expected the last sentence, and when it arrived it undid something tight just below her ribs. Zita looked at her with a complicated expression that could have been contempt and might have been recognition, which is worse.\n\nZita\u2019s answer came with the steadiness of someone who understood performance and had trained herself to hate confessed need as a road to hunger she could not control. \u201cI owe you money,\u201d she said first, and several people below laughed in the relieved way crowds do when a line is thrown like a bone. \u201cI owe you my best angle. I owe you to behave in your cabin so you keep letting me in. I owe you nothing else.\u201d It would have been an answer in a more ordinary place. The wheel considered. It had long since learned not to expect gratitude, but it liked to be addressed as a thing with a job. The wood thrummed underfoot. The cabinet with the camera in it twitched, embarrassed to be seen judging. Magda felt the relief that comes when a place has taken your answer and not spit it back in your face as if you had spoken nonsense to a tree.\n\nThe voice upstairs, startled into mortal duty, returned. \u201cFourth,\u201d it said, but it sounded scuffed. \u201cThere is a clause concerning measures of silence. Recite it.\u201d Zita spoke quickly to get back on the part of the map where she knew where to put her feet. \u201cSilence must be equal when it happens; time without speech is counted and carried over. You cannot starve someone with quiet. That\u2019s written.\u201d Her thumb rubbed the ring it wore, and the fishhook question mark flashed in the cabin\u2019s electric light. Magda thought of the three mustard seeds again. She could smell faintly, under the cedar, a bitterness. It might have been her imagination; it might have been the way winter makes sometimes of people: small gardens growing in the wrong places.\n\n\u201cWe owe each other to leave some of it unsaid,\u201d Magda added, because clauses are improved by mercy when they are remembered out loud. \u201cWe owe each other to leave room for what can\u2019t be said to sit down without being asked to dance. That is the part the book leaves out, but the city knows it. If you press your ear to the statue by the Rathaus long enough, the stone will say the same, and the police will shrug and pretend not to notice you being peculiar because you are not hurting anyone.\u201d The voice did not accept or deny. It had begun to understand that arguing with the ground was bad for its warranty.\n\nThe fifth came flavored like arithmetic, which was Zita\u2019s field, even if the numbers she liked best were ratings and not sums. \u201cEight is not only a number,\u201d Magda said before the question could finish posing itself as an ordinary invitation to count. \u201cEight is the way two circles decide they will not be lonely.\u201d Zita made a noise as if to swat away a fly. \u201cEight is the law\u2019s vanity,\u201d she said, and the camera adored her again because contempt always photographs like glamour. \u201cIt is the way you draw infinity when you are too tired to stand upright. It\u2019s not magic; it\u2019s an agreement. We agreed to this one. We could agree to a nine and call it better because it looks like a person who has stopped pretending to be a serpent.\u201d She had a point. She often had points. It had made her able to cut through cloth she had not woven.\n\nBelow, the man who ran the wheel scratched his ear with a key, and Petra leaned in and said something to the clipboard woman in the careful tone of someone asking politely for a door to be opened that must be opened twice. The clipboard woman listened with all the disdain good clerks carry like an umbrella, and then moved toward a panel and pressed her thumb there for exactly as long as it takes the human body to remember a time when food was not guaranteed. The cabin jolted. Wind that had been working hard all afternoon was admitted in a gust that ignored show business. Zita\u2019s hair loosened by a piece. She did not reach to fix it, which Magda admired because pettiness is catching and she was trying not to be infected tonight.\n\n\u201cSixth,\u201d the voice said, running now, because someone somewhere had told it the world preferred momentum. It asked the sort of thing you kept in the pocket of an exam: list three protections afforded to the ordinary citizens in the case of spectacle, and to whom they are to petition for relief. Zita looked so bored for a moment that Magda could see the girl she had been before the world learned to clap for her. \u201cEarplugs,\u201d Zita said. \u201cSafe exits. The right not to be filmed if they raise three fingers and keep them up. Petition goes to the officer in the bright jacket who pretends not to be a priest, or to the operator who pretends not to be God, or to the woman with the clipboard who is God\u2019s intern.\u201d It was a good answer because it was not wrong; it was wrong because it kindled nothing gentle in the room; and the wood did not bother noting the difference because it had seen much worse and did not have the bandwidth for didactics.\n\nMagda added the thing the books had footnoted only in the older editions, the ones printed when ink smelled funny and pages stuck together in damp weather. \u201cThey can also petition the crowd,\u201d she said, and felt the murmur below change as people remembered that safety sometimes is only that: looking sideways and deciding to be the voice that says no when no is needed. \u201cThree people shouting is a petition. Ten is a rule.\u201d She glanced at Petra without moving her head. Petra stood with her feet apart and her big arms folded and her face a geography of stubbornness and love. The woman with the clipboard, to her credit, did not roll her eyes. She had been doing this too long to refute common sense.\n\nThere was time moving around them that did not stay in place like normal time. It was the time of waiting rooms and of lovers holding their breath and of the space between a lit match and the first lick of flame. When the seventh came, it came like a coin you drop on purpose because you want to hear if it clinks the right way. \u201cQuestion,\u201d said Zita then, stepping in where the voice had been about to. It was her proffer. Her eyes were bright with a hunger that had belonged to her since she was small and had been told to eat less of herself. \u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d she asked in a tone scraped free of the sugar she used for television. \u201cNot the job. Not the little jobs. The big one. The one people come into back rooms to talk to you about. The one with the saints and the stairs and the why-don\u2019t-you just join us and stop pretending to be a civilian. Why did you stop doing the work the way we do it?\u201d\n\nThere was a sound then that had nothing to do with the wheel. It was the small dry noise of a thing inside your chest that has been looked at without being warned. Magda opened her mouth and closed it and opened it again, a hinge that had not been oiled recently. She thought of her teacher\u2019s hand in the margin with its neat notes and its sentence about the person who loves you and wants you to win. She thought of a year when she had gotten too good at the trick where you leave a room with everyone believing they had won. She thought of a night on a roof when she had said yes to something and then had woken in the morning with the word no under her tongue like a pill you are supposed to swallow without water. \u201cBecause fair and kind are not the same,\u201d she said finally. \u201cBecause I am not fair and I am particular about that. Because the room where you do it is hungry in a way that makes me cruel. Because appetite makes me stupid and I liked being less stupid. Because my mother died and I discovered that if I kept winning while being the kind of person who kept winning, the grief had nowhere to sit, and it started to shiver in public. Because I found out I liked kitchens better than stages and could not persuade myself that this was an improvement some days. Because.\u201d She did not wrap it in a bow. The wheels of the city carried a distant siren along.\n\nZita watched her the way a person in a closed carriage watches the weather through a crack, searching for a meaning beyond dampness. \u201cI thought it would be something uglier,\u201d she said, almost disappointed. \u201cI brought uglier answers with me. I packed them carefully.\u201d She had. They showed under her coat like gashes she had drawn in shadow where no one could touch them without taking her side. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she added fiercely. \u201cAsk a sharp thing and see if I bleed in a way the audience will clap for.\u201d\n\nMagda had a sharp thing ready. It sat in her mouth and tasted like a coin that has passed through too many hands. The wheel creaked and told her they had one more turn before the eighth. She could ask something that would make Zita say a name, and the name would be currency, and Magda could spend it in all the ways she had promised herself she no longer enjoyed. Or she could ask for generosity and make a liar of herself and a fool too, and fools do not survive these rooms unless the room is merciful and the wheel was a machine, not a god. She thought of mustard. She thought of three tiny seeds in a pocket warming by a body. She thought of how seeds do not care why they are carried; they care only for when. \u201cWho taught you to cheat?\u201d was what the crowd wanted. \u201cWho taught you not to be gentle?\u201d was what a better person would say. She surprised them both and herself. \u201cWhat did you leave behind,\u201d she asked softly, \u201cwhen you walked from Leoben? The first thing. Without telling yourself a story about why.\u201d\n\nIt was a question with a hook in it. Place questions can be refused, but they leave splinters. Zita\u2019s face went very still. Her eyes did the little flick not toward a wire but toward something inside her head that had a very small child\u2019s room in it. \u201cA ring,\u201d she said at last. She made the sound of a person swallowing not pride but a small burst of contempt for her former self. \u201cVery thin. It belonged to someone who told me to wait in a way that made waiting feel like being put in a cupboard. I left it on a post by the bridge with a bus to Vienna due in twelve minutes. I told myself I would come back for it and then I did not.\u201d It was ordinary. It was not ordinary at all. Somewhere below, someone with a romantic disposition clutched at a chest that had weathered three wars and a renovation, and told the person beside them a story about the time they had left something small and metal in a place where rain could find it.\n\nThe eighth came over them like a coat you have loved without cleaning too often. The bell at the carousel measured it. The wheel took it slowly because it had been asked a good question and had been given two answers that fit more or less into the holes the world had left in their respective bodies. The camera whirred the way a small animal whirs when it is asleep and dreaming of running. The voice had a penultimate thing to say, because of course it did: \u201cFinal. Declare your instrument.\u201d It was an archaic requirement from the days when men said sword and pistol and had eyelashes so long they cast shadows on their cheeks in oil paintings. The modern version was a formality that usually produced words like intellect, charm, grit, and team. Zita lifted her hand. \u201cAudience,\u201d she said, with a frankness that was almost tender. \u201cI have become what I am because you want what I am and I am not ashamed of having learned to be it. You are my instrument. That is a compliment and a theft.\u201d Her voice softened on the last word in a way that would make very many people forgive her.\n\nMagda placed her palm against the cabin again. \u201cPlace,\u201d she said. \u201cI am an instrument when something notices where it is being asked to happen. Streets. Kitchens. Wheels. That and the way names sit in the mouth. And the way coffee hands over what it learns when it passes through ground. And the person who braided my hair. And the person who has never once asked me to be smaller so they could feel taller. Those are my instruments.\u201d She did not look down when she said person. She did not say Petra\u2019s name. She had learned that names in these rooms grew teeth and would chew up your foot if you dangled it too close to the floor. The wood under her hand was warm now enough that she could feel the pulse of the axle through it, a small repetition like the word yes when said by someone who rarely uses it.\n\nThe wheel slowed. The world below was still the world, which meant you could buy roasted chestnuts if you wanted and watch a horse drag a cart of beer with a dignity that would have made old Dukes jealous. The cabin slid into its lowermost thought. The latch was readying itself for home. \u201cVerdict,\u201d the voice said, hungry to be done before it embarrassed itself by seeming human. Magda watched Zita\u2019s shoulder blades under her coat move as she took a breath to tolerate the sensation of being weighed by anything other than her own need. The crowd arranged its faces into listening. The man with the key scratched his ear again because habit is a kind of shelter.\n\nWhat the wheel would say was none of the camera\u2019s business, not for that moment. It belonged to wood and to the law and to the wet breath of a million people who had stood and kissed and fought and eaten in the radius of its shadow. It had one job left: to make the eighth turn contain not only motion but a memory that would attach itself to the two women in the cabin in a way neither of them could pick off later and call stain. The bell in the carousel sang one last time with all the formality of a civil servant who knew his work was delicate even if his tools were crude. The cabin rocked. The latch lifted its chin. The wind lifted hair and then laid it down.\n\n\u201cHold,\u201d said the wheel quietly, not to the voice and not to the camera and not to the people. It was a word it had learned from brakes. \u201cHold and know.\u201d The door did not open yet. The turn took its time. Magda smiled without showing teeth again, because it was all she knew to do at the edge of the idea of an ending. Zita\u2019s hand went absently to the thin ring on her thumb, and for the first time since stepping into the cabin she looked like someone who had been small and alone and then had put on a coat and practiced three faces until they obeyed. Down below, Petra licked her thumb and drew a circle on the wood of the wheelhouse and finished it, and made a face at the clipboard woman, who did not see but would be aware later that a kindness had happened near her in a way that made her day more possible. And far up in the steel, in a place where no one cleaned because no one could reach, something small and black with bright eyes peered down and thought about the heat of language and about the way questions, like kettles, know when to sing.The door remembered its job before the voice did, and in that half second Magda thought she felt the hinge consider the moral weight of opening. The wheel had said hold, and because it had been built by men who trusted their hands more than anything that called itself a system, it obeyed its own command without waiting for permission. There was a sympathetic hush from below that had nothing to do with production and everything to do with bodies understanding that a thing was deciding something in their presence. Zita\u2019s eyes did their small private arithmetic and came up briefly empty, which made her beautiful and terrible in a way that would have moved an older painter to start a new school.\n\n\u201cBy scope declared and place acknowledged,\u201d said the wheel at last, and the voice from the ceiling transcribed as best it could, a clerk being asked to take dictation from weather. \u201cBy breath given to air that was being told how to behave. By the old municipal courtesy that pretends to be shy and is not. Contest is incomplete because instrument was overbroad and because wire whispered in a room that promised silence.\u201d The words were not words, not how courts make them, and yet they came as sentences do when you have trained your mouth to be reliable. The camera panicked and steadied; somewhere a producer swallowed a series of noises that would have gotten him fired if he had let them become audible. Petra smiled so slightly that only the woman with the clipboard, whose job had taught her to notice small resistances, saw and pretended not to.\n\n\u201cWhat does incomplete look like,\u201d Zita asked, and to her credit she put no sugar on it, no tilt of the chin to indicate she would turn even an insult into inventory. Her hand had left the ring and returned to it; you could tell only because her thumb was blushed pale where the metal had pressed. Magda felt the cat\u2019s absence as a shape and guessed, without needing to look, that the bright-eyed thing high in the iron had been her inconvenient familiar deciding to experience the city from a place we pretend is only for pigeons and maintenance men. The wheel creaked once, as if it were warming itself to the work of an answer no one had asked it in a hundred years.\n\n\u201cIncomplete means return,\u201d the wheel said, and the bell across the square answered with a single tongue against bronze, an involuntary amen. \u201cTwo turns hence the cabin will open again in the presence of those who insist on witnessing. Petitioner\u2019s advantage is halved by the speaking wire and will be made equal by the thing under glass called a kitchen, in a room the respondent names. Between now and then, neither may speak aloud the name of the other in public, under penalty of poor luck in small matters and a mildew that chooses its own corners. Questions may be asked of place, not of person, and place will answer if it wants to. Instruments are declared and will not be traded without notice. Hold and know.\u201d It was bureaucratic in the way storms are bureaucratic\u2014they have procedures, they follow them, they do not tend to write reports.\n\n\u201cSo we are scolded and sent to wash our hands,\u201d Zita said quietly, and she looked, for a breath, like a girl being told dinner is at six and she must earn it by setting the table. The glare she sent the camera was so small most eyes missed it, but the machine did not, and it shivered in its casing like a dog that has learned to fear a certain tone. Magda let out a breath she did not know she had been hiring to keep her spine straight. She didn\u2019t look at Petra. Looking at Petra now would send a thread across the cabin the way children once strung string between two tin cans and pretended the voice came clean; that thread would be cut by the thing that called itself spectacle and then wrapped around their throats like an ornament.\n\nThe latch gave up its resistance, and the door prepared to return to being a door instead of a mouth. The crowd made the communal decision to applaud, but because the verdict had not been a verdict, the sound hiccuped into something like polite laughter and then sorted itself into a warm, complicated noise that could not be put on a showreel with confidence. The woman with the clipboard wrote a word Magda could not see and then wrote another and then underlined both with the concentration of a person who understood that underline was not merely emphasis but conjuration. The operator, whose name would never be printed anywhere because he had the caution of someone who had once watched two boys climb under the wheel without knowing what they were playing with, scratched his ear again and muttered to the lever. The lever, instructed by a thousand nights of work, ignored him with respect.\n\n\u201cTwo turns hence,\u201d Magda said, because even when a machine had spoken it, the sentence wanted a human mouth to register properly in the air. She softened the words as she sent them out, a habit learned in courtyards where doors have learned, through long acquaintance with refugees and salesmen, to open only for certain kinds of wind. Zita\u2019s mouth took its neutral expression back as if taking off a hat that had started to itch. \u201cFine,\u201d she said, and the fine was so thickly varnished with acceptance that no one saw the splinters under it unless they were looking hard. \u201cI hope your kitchen is clean. I hope your knives have no ghosts.\u201d It was not a threat. It was a professional courtesy expressed in blade length.\n\nThey stepped out and the cold took both women equally, which pleased Magda in a childish way she did not mind indulging just now. The first few rows of the crowd\u2014those who had decided to have faces and names tonight rather than be a generality\u2014leaned in as if expecting autographs on the air. A man whose day job was selling budget insurance on the phone said aloud to his companion that he had never realized how much the Ferris wheel sounded like the organ at St. Roch\u2019s when the priest was new and enthusiastic. Petra reached Magda just beyond the circle the clipboard\u2019s lanyard had declared sacred and temporary, and she did the thing you do when you have no ritual prepared for what you must acknowledge: she touched the back of Magda\u2019s head just above the nape, as if to reassure the hair that it had done correctly staying braided.\n\n\u201cYou were yourself,\u201d Petra said in a tone that refused to put frosting on praise. \u201cShe was herself too, which is a pity because I sometimes wish people like her would be other people on Tuesdays. The wheel was an old bureaucrat who discovered for a second it could have a soul, and then remembered it had to be at work again in the morning. Do we drink something that burns or something that sweetens your mouth enough to keep you from biting anyone who comes near you on the tram.\u201d\n\n\u201cBurn me and then sweeten me,\u201d Magda said, and it made Petra bark a laugh that sent three small birds off the roof of the nearby ticket kiosk. The woman with the clipboard approached then with the look of someone whose job required delivering information to people who might choose to eat the information and the messenger both. She held out a folded paper in a plastic sleeve with a stamp that did not exist outside the city\u2019s secret drawers. Her eyebrows did not bother attempting sympathy; her mouth had never practiced it.\n\n\u201cBy the office that watches the oath,\u201d the woman said, and she did not apologize for the office, which was good manners, \u201cyou are notified that the second session will be permitted as declared if you furnish the address within twelve hours. Kitchens must comply with ventilation standards. The device with the camera will be admitted if it remembers to be respectful. The wire will be tested for silence with a bowl of water and a spoon. If the spoon moves, the bowl goes out the window and the broadcast loses its rights for a quarter under section nine. Sign.\u201d She had two pens and offered the nice one first. Magda took the less nice one because there are small resistances she will never give up.\n\n\u201cI will send the address in an hour,\u201d Magda said, and she felt Petra\u2019s arm solid beside her, a post a horse might be tied to without humiliation. Zita took her copy and did not look at it; she slid it into the pocket inside her coat that had been sewn by hands that knew this was where a person kept the documents they could not afford to lose. She caught Magda\u2019s eye then and allowed herself a brief grinning: the grin was a truce flag made of foil, attractive and disposable. \u201cI hope you cook first,\u201d she said. \u201cI dislike kitchens that pretend to be museums. And I hope your neighbor upstairs does not practice a tuba on Thursdays because the camera is allergic to tubas.\u201d She turned away before either of them could answer, because control depends on the appearance of never waiting to be dismissed.\n\nThey did not take the tram. The cold made the air something you could lean on, and the walk back was a way to unknot ankles that had tried to understand a moving room. Petra bought chestnuts from a man who had burned his fingers so often he had lost the habit of flinching. The paper cone warmed their palms through their gloves, and the smoke underlined the night with a line of text streetlights could not parse. A boy ran past and shouted into the ice, \u201cShe\u2019s going to fight in a kitchen,\u201d with the joy of someone who had learned a new rule for a game he planned to cheat at and win honestly anyway. The boy\u2019s mother followed and said his name\u2014and because names are spells, he slowed and let her catch his sleeve without complaint.\n\n\u201cThere is a spoon that knows too much in my second drawer,\u201d Magda said, as if they had been discussing shopping lists all along. \u201cIt will tell stories to the bowl until the office becomes embarrassed and praises its compliance with a stamp. I will choose the big pot with the dent, because I do not trust pots that are confident. Will you come at seven and pretend to be a person who is just here for salt.\u201d Petra nodded as someone who had already planned the morning\u2019s thefts and kindnesses might. \u201cI will bring bread and nothing sharper than my tongue,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cat will sit on the fridge and criticize your chopping. Bruno will try to come and pretend to fix something so that he can be present for posterity and write about it in his small ugly notebook. I will tell him there is a fee for men with notebooks and watch him go home briskly.\u201d\n\nIn the stairwell of her building the light did its midnight trick of arguing with the timer, and they climbed the last flights in a glow no one had paid for. The cat was sitting on the table as if it had been paid to supervise and was willing to accept late payment in fish. Its ears said three rooms had said unwise things while they were gone and two had made soup. It examined the plastic sleeve, sneezed with disdain, and then turned its attention to a small draft coming from the window where the seal was insufficient in winter and wonderfully permissive in spring. \u201cWe will host a part of the city,\u201d Magda told it, because houses like to be informed when they are about to be asked to perform. \u201cWe will wash, and we will hide certain things in the drawer you cannot open without pebbles and a curse, and we will leave the sugar where it can save a sentence that wants to curdle.\u201d\n\nShe wrote the address on a card made for doctors\u2019 waiting rooms and slid it into the envelope the clipboard woman had left. She wrote the words in a hand that did not want to be read by people who intended to argue about kerning. The kitchen looked at her then, the way kitchens look, with a severity born of having seen every kind of human attempt either to keep promises or to abandon them with style. She said aloud that she was grateful for the stove\u2019s stubbornness and for the way the water in this building sometimes ran brown for three seconds and then fixed itself without being asked. Gratitude is a lubricant as well as a salve; the pipes hummed with the satisfaction of being seen.\n\nShe did not sleep. That was not a decision but a weather system. Petra, who could fall asleep against a wall in a well-lit station while a man with a violin practiced murder beside her, installed herself on the couch with her boots off and announced in a conversational voice how many tiles were on the ceiling if you counted only the whole ones. The cat prowled the dawn, which arrived bruised and unrepentant. Letters slid under the door with the practiced insolence of the city; one was from the office, stamped and official like a promise made by a person you love and slightly do not trust; one was a postcard from a woman in Croatia who sent Magda listless drawings of shells; one was a flier for teeth whitening that had stolen its font from a revolution. Magda drank coffee and then tea and then water and thought about the word incomplete until it became a gift rather than an insult.\n\nAt eight in the morning a municipal employee whose badge had sat muttering in a drawer for weeks rang the bell. He carried a bowl, a spoon, a checklist, and a look of long-suffering professionalism that had become in him almost an art. He was small and fastidious and looked like a person who had resisted becoming somebody\u2019s father only to discover late that fatherliness came in other forms and had found him anyway. \u201cI am here to test your air for opinions,\u201d he said, and he didn\u2019t smile because he did not want to be the kind of civil servant who made light of the work. \u201cThe spoon must move only when invited. The bowl must not tremble. You must sign, and if you cheat I will tell your grandmother.\u201d Those lines were written and had been handed to him; he had learned to deliver them without bitterness because bitterness curdles spoons.\n\nMagda brought him into the kitchen with the respect due a priest who had renounced all gods but holds the power to declare your bread legal tender. He set the bowl on the table, which tried not to remember the black wax mark. He placed the spoon in the bowl with a gentleness that implied he had once, perhaps as a boy, spoken to small river creatures and expected them to answer. \u201cThere will be a question,\u201d he said, studying a stopwatch as if it owed him an apology. \u201cWhen it is asked, the spoon will want to argue. You will not let it. Are you ready.\u201d Magda looked at Petra, who refrained from making the spoon laugh by telling it a story about a man in a bar who had mistaken his own reflection for a friend. \u201cWe are ready,\u201d Magda said, and the cat, on the fridge, sighed as if to say it had seen this trick and found it theatrically effective but narratively lazy.\n\nThe voice from last night was piped in thinly through a device the inspector set on the table, a cylinder of metal perforated like an old theater voice. It asked a dull question, something about ordinance subclauses that would put an inkpot to sleep. The spoon twitched. The bowl did not. Petra put two fingers lightly on the table as if soothing a nervous horse. Magda drew a circle only in her head and did not finish it, a courtesy to a spoon that had not asked to be a proxy for ethics. The spoon considered humility and decided to be cooperative today. The inspector clicked his stopwatch and nodded once, the nod of a man whose job at last goes as intended, a relief so rare it felt foreign.\n\n\u201cCompliance noted,\u201d he said, filling a small square on a larger square with ink. \u201cYour kitchen smells like someone who can translate sadness into soup, which is not on the form but should be. At fourteen hundred hours the technicians will inspect your outlets for spirits. If they find any, they will leave them outside in a jar, and you can keep them if you wish. They have learned not to make friends with what they harvest because of an incident in Ottakring involving a boy who fell in love with a draft. At nineteen hundred hours the recording equipment will arrive and then your privacy ends until we write it down that it begins again. Please have mercy on the crew. They eat badly, and it makes them mean.\u201d He packed the spoon and the bowl away as if tucking a child into a stroller and let the clock in his body sweep him back into the city.\n\nThe day stretched itself across the building. The woman upstairs did not practice the tuba; instead she played a song on a piano that had suffered for its art and came through the ceiling like smoke. Bruno came and did try to fix something, as Petra had prophesied, and accepted the fee for men with notebooks with more grace than expected and retreated with his dignity intact and his notebook heavier for it. The cat disappeared and reappeared with a scrap of foil in its mouth as if making an offering to a god of artificial light. Magda cooked because cooking made the air rounder and less likely to pick up whispers and because you cannot lead a city into your kitchen and feed it nothing but rules.\n\nIn the afternoon, a young woman with hair dyed a decisive green knocked and presented a form in triplicate that demanded permission to film the hallway for transitional shots. She looked at the wall where a bicycle had scraped a bruise last year and saw in it a future scene where a woman walks away from a camera and everyone at home thinks, for a moment, that they could follow her and they do not. She kindly put blue masking tape along the floor where tripods must not stand because your neighbor downstairs had confessed she had once been stuck in a doorway while carrying three loaves of bread and had not recovered her courage. Petra brewed coffee until the room could balance on the smell alone. Magda moved knives around until their placement said respect instead of threat, and then she moved them again because superstition builds furniture and she wanted to be sure the chairs it made would not collapse under a polite person.\n\nEvening approached like a neighbor who knows whether to borrow sugar or to bring cake. The crew arrived carrying cases that looked like coffins for small robots. The camera flinched when it saw the stove as if remembering last night\u2019s small glare and wanted to apologize without using language. The man who monitored sound had ears like shells, and he wore a hat that had decided already how long it planned to remain on his head. He tested the walls by tapping them with a knuckle and listened to the returns as if listening for a tone only he knew the names of. He asked whether there had ever been a child crying in this room for two hours while someone did something with apples, and when Magda said yes he told the wall to behave because echoes love to think they are the most important people in the room.\n\nAt seven, the woman with the clipboard came with a new clipboard, which suggested the old one had been sent to a drawer to calm down. She read the formality that hung between them like a curtain and let it drop. The city was in the doorway now. It had taken off its hat. It wanted to be fed and adjudicated and permitted to have an opinion that would not be punished in the morning. Zita arrived without a coat and without the expression she wore for stages. She was smaller in a kitchen, not because the room diminished her but because power has to change shoes when it crosses thresholds. She looked around as if taking an inventory, then laughed once in the direction of the kettle, which had just then decided to whistle, a coincidence she chose to let become an omen.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d Magda said, and the word did something to the light. It made it warmer without making it brighter. She held out a plate because kitchens know what they are for, and Zita took a slice of bread as if it were a failure to admit hunger in front of witnesses. Petra nodded to her as a person nods to someone who has just explained their own burden honestly. The cat launched itself with practiced indifference onto the fridge and looked down as if judging a parade. Outside the window the world behaved; snow made a clean noise against the glass; a siren passed as if ashamed of needing attention.\n\nThe voice from the ceiling was humbler here. It had the sound of being poured out of an enamel cup rather than a goblet. \u201cTwo turns hence,\u201d it said, obedient to the wheel\u2019s arithmetic, and the operator across town touched the lever in the wheelhouse not because he needed to but because habit extends itself through the city when invoked. \u201cContest resumes, instrument declared. Scope halved and equalized by pot, knife, heat. Air tested compliant. Witnesses present. Officiant: place.\u201d The camera tucked itself into the corner and tried not to cast a shadow that would make the chopping board anxious.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do, then,\u201d Zita asked, and there was curiosity in it unadorned by a pose. The question made her more dangerous in the way a child with a stick becomes dangerous only when she learns it is a wand if you pretend correctly and ask politely. Magda looked at the book on the shelf with the blue thread and did not take it down because she had learned the temptation of reading the spell instead of being hospitable to it. She lifted a pot and set it on the stove so lightly the iron did not dare complain.\n\n\u201cWe ask place to tell us what it knows,\u201d she said, and she thought she felt the knot of the city move, the way a sleeping dog shifts and remembers that it is entrusted with entire rooms. \u201cWe will not ask about saints. We will not ask about ratings. We will ask the table why it remembers certain elbows and what they meant. We will ask the floor what footprints it has chosen to keep. We will ask the sink what it has refused to swallow. If you cheat in here, the coffee will burn you and the sugar will pretend to be salt and every parsley leaf will turn away from your knife. If I cheat, the cupboard will refuse to open and the matches will break, and Petra will not talk to me for two days.\u201d She smiled then because she had almost made herself a liar on purpose by promising punishment she could not guarantee.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Zita said, and there was eagerness there she could not keep out. She put her palms on the table and did an old thing by accident; she asked blessing without pronouncing the word and the table, having seen worse, granted a provisional approval. The voice in the corner drew a breath for its opening and then thought better of it. The clipboard, endowed for the evening with something like a conscience, sat very still and did not tap itself against the woman\u2019s leg.\n\nMagda poured water into the pot and added salt and then did not count breaths because counting would make it a show and she had not invited show, despite the camera\u2019s presence. She put onions on a board and cut them. She did not weep because she had wept last year and the onions recognized her as kin. Zita watched and did the respectful thing; she did not offer to help; she did not pretend ignorance; she let the knife make a conversation with wood and flesh and the green center of a sprig of savory. \u201cAsk your first,\u201d Magda said, because generosity is a resource and if you hoard it the pipes go dry. She kept her eyes on the knife as a courtesy to both of them.\n\n\u201cWhat is the oldest thing in this room,\u201d Zita asked, and then, because the law required specificity, \u201cthat still remembers being something else.\u201d Her voice sought the corners. It did not command. It waited. The kitchen, which had not been asked so directly in years if ever, rustled. The sugar made a small avalanche; the stove clicked twice. Petra, who had been born with a river running the length of her spine and a coal cellared somewhere above her heart, looked at the windowsill where a jar sat that had once held cherries.\n\n\u201cThe towel,\u201d said the room, and Magda startled a little that it had decided to speak aloud and not through muscle memory and the small adjustments that happen when you cook right. \u201cThe towel was a shirt,\u201d the room said, \u201cand before it was a shirt it was a tablecloth for a picnic where two people said unwise things under trees, and before that it was a sheet on a bed in a room where a man who had done everything badly once did one thing well and then tried to make a habit of it and failed.\u201d The voice did not come from one point; it came from all the places where cloth remembers skin. The camera, poor creature, had no setting for this; it hummed in sympathy and hoped that sympathetic hum would be legible to the office later when the forms had to be justified.\n\n\u201cSecond,\u201d Magda said, and the onion consented to be browned rather than burned. \u201cWhat does the sink refuse to swallow.\u201d She knew the answer but asked because rooms like to be asked to say what they have been forced to tolerate. \u201cPromises,\u201d said the sink at once, and Petra clapped her hands once before remembering she was not here to applaud plumbing. \u201cIt spits them back. It will take blood if you let it, and it will complain and then forgive. But it will not take promises if you whisper them into the drain. They sound like bones trying to be whistles.\u201d Zita made a sound that might have been a laugh and might have been a kind of surprise. She touched the lip of the sink, and then snatched her hand back without thinking because the lip had been warmed by hot water and domesticity, and she had expected obligation to be colder.\n\n\u201cThird,\u201d the voice from the ceiling tried in a small way to re-establish its dignity. \u201cUnder the oath\u2019s kitchen clause, both parties will now declare a memory of this place not told before to outsiders, to ground themselves in something other than performance.\u201d The clause had been written by a municipal clerk who had once saved a child from choking by lying convincingly about the presence of a toy in the next room, and had then gone home and made soup with hands that would not stop shaking.\n\n\u201cI burned a pot,\u201d Magda said, and it felt like a benediction because it was so simple. \u201cIt was summer. I was in love with a woman who liked to pretend that being late had been outlawed. I watched a sparrow on the windowsill and thought I could be someone different if I learned to stand still exactly as long as a small bird takes to assess a threat. The pot took offense at the neglect and became black at the bottom as if it had been reading some philosophy I disapprove of. I kept the pot because I wanted to have in this room a thing that would survive my attention wandering.\u201d\n\n\u201cI slept on that floor,\u201d Zita said, surprising them both, and the floor answered with a small creak as if to say it had been expecting to be brought in at the end, as a witness no one had bothered to list. \u201cI slept here two years ago after a party. I did not know it was your floor. I did not know this was your kitchen. I woke up and ate something that had been left out on the table and confessed a lie to a jar and then told it to keep its mouth shut. It did. It was cherries.\u201d The jar, flattered, adjusted its glass the way a very old person adjusts a collar when told they have done their hair correctly. Petra raised her eyebrows and then lowered them as if storing a question for a day when the city was less in the room.\n\nOn the stove, the water behaved. On the sill, the savory let go of its sting into steam. The city outside sat, attentive as a cat in a beam of sun, choosing for once to be the audience rather than the act. Magda tucked a strand of hair behind her ear that had escaped Petra\u2019s braid and thought about how answers come differently in rooms that have agreed to receive them. Zita\u2019s face had lost the small tension that television insists on; she was listening with vanity briefly in abeyance. The voice in the ceiling asked something important then, because even voices earn their keep on strange nights.\n\n\u201cAdmit cost,\u201d it said, and the cupboard door chose this moment to ease itself open, as if to agree that public accounting had its place. \u201cAdmit what you will pay if you keep being exactly who you are in rooms like this and in rooms like the one on the wheel. Do not be elegant. Do not weaponize it. Put it on the table with the bread and let witnesses decide whether they want to eat it.\u201d The question had come out of an ordinance that had itself been born of a scandal with eels and a photograph and a judge who wore his sorrow badly; it had been shaped since then by people who had to put their names to papers that would outlive their bodies.\n\n\u201cMy mother will keep dying in small ways,\u201d Magda said, because she had never found a kinder way to put it even in her mind. \u201cI will be thought difficult by men who want me to be gentle in exactly the way they are used to being consoled. I will be loved less often in public by people who do not like to applaud a person who refuses to give them the version with neat corners. I will write fewer invoices and more recipes, and the balance will become precarious. I will be boring on Wednesdays. I will be someone the city calls on when it is tired of being lied to and then forgets to invite when it wants a story told at a certain speed.\u201d She set the ladle down and let the steam wash her mouth with the taste of salt that had not yet become soup.\n\n\u201cI will be alone unless I decide not to be and then I will be less good at the work I was made for,\u201d Zita said, and her lip curled on the last words not because she did not believe them but because believing them had become an insult she liked to throw into corners. \u201cI will be envied, which is a tax, and I will be punished, which is also a tax, and I will pay both because I like buying things that make other people uncomfortable. I will be wrong publicly once in a way that will be turned into a comic T-shirt sold by men with rucksacks and a contempt for women who are not their mothers. I will have nowhere to put tenderness except in places that do not deserve it or want to be seen doing so.\u201d She held out her palms as if to show they were empty and the room in a very quiet way made them heavy with the small weight of flour motes and the larger weight of not lying.\n\nThe wheel, across town, felt the pot come to a boil and had an urge it rarely had in the winter: it wanted to stop moving and come into a room where women were using the correct verbs for their lives. The operator scolded the lever for being sentimental and drank his tea, which had been made irresponsibly strong by a niece who was trying to learn contempt from the radio. The bell at the carousel missed a beat and then remembered itself and pretended it had meant to.\n\n\u201cVerdict,\u201d said the place, because even kitchens like endings when the soup is ready and the knives are arranged like well-behaved planets. It did not say who had won; it said instead what must happen if they insisted on continuing to make nights like this in this city where the rules sometimes are written on napkins and sometimes on marble and sometimes on beer. \u201cPetitioner will not bring wires into rooms that answer. Respondent will not punish victory with scorn. Both will feed the witnesses. If you are to do this again\u2014and you will, because the city likes it and your bones like it more than you admit\u2014you will do it with the understanding that scope includes mercy and not only theater. The oath of contest is amended in this kitchen for the space of one winter and the width of this table. If someone disapproves, they may take it up with the wheel when it is in the mood to entertain complaints.\u201d The clipboard scribbled as if trying to keep up and failing; the woman holding it made the face of a person told that an extra line must be fitted into a page already full.\n\nZita laughed then with something like gratitude braided into the sound, and even the cat forgave it. \u201cSo I am asked to win kindly,\u201d she said, and she shrugged with delicacy and a certain ferocity, as if to say that kindness could be its own spectacle if taught to pose. \u201cSo I am asked to not build my throne out of knives and then call it furniture. I have been asked worse by people with worse rooms.\u201d She took a bowl from Magda\u2019s hand and accepted soup as if someone had awarded her a prize that had not been paid for by injury.\n\nPetra, whose wrists had become spoons from decades of stirring when no one else would do it, pulled chairs out with the authority of a person who knows what to do with people exposed briefly to truth. The crew looked at each other as men do when told that their job will require them to be humans in a place that expects it and will mark them down for doing it wrong. The clipboard woman put the pen on the table and ate bread as someone who had been hungry and had not known. The city, at the window, fogged the glass and wrote a rude word and then wiped it off itself, embarrassed and entertained, because it had learned tonight that it enjoyed being asked to tell stories by rooms that knew the shape of a sentence before it was born.\n\nThey ate. The camera took what it could get and did not get in the way. The voice in the corner tried to remember a hymn and discovered it could not, which relieved it of a certain anxiety. Zita and Magda did not drink to each other because toasts are promises and they had already made one to place; they did touch the rims of their bowls together once in a gesture that belonged in a story Orpheus would have enjoyed if he had been born in a housing estate. Petra talked about nothing of consequence across the top of it all, which is to say she served as priest and entertainer both without acknowledging herself as either.\n\nLater, much later, when even the city had fallen briefly quiet and the footage had been copied to three drives and labeled with words that would make no sense to anyone who had not had to testify in a room with fluorescent lighting, Magda stood alone in the kitchen in the kind of silence that had earned her regard. The cat rubbed its face along the leg of a chair, rendering it formally the cat\u2019s property under a law no office had ever dared to write down. She looked at the pot, at the towel, at the bowl that had behaved for the inspector because it prefers to please when asked correctly, and she let herself consider the word incomplete again. It no longer tasted like defeat; it tasted like yeast, which makes things rise if you do not rush it and makes a mess if you do. She turned the clocks to face the wall and let the apartment catch its breath. She did not sleep. She did not need to. The night had been its own rest, a kind of work that, for once, paid her back in the currency she preferred: a room she loved being more itself because she had asked it to be.By morning the city\u2019s appetite for rules had sobered, and a thin light in the kitchen admitted itself with the caution of a clerk who knows both how to refuse and how to bend. The clocks were still facing the wall, which meant time had been asked to sit in the corner and keep its voice down. The cat had slept on the chair with its paws folded in a way that suggested piety and mischief had shaken hands, and its whiskers held the memory of steam though no kettle had sung for hours. Magda\u2019s body had the particular ache given by nights that are both argument and feast. She stood at the window and watched the courtyard consider frost, which it did each winter the way some people consider religion: suspiciously and with an almost sensual calculation of inconvenience.\n\nThe papers did their part by not printing what had happened and letting their headlines behave as if truth would stain if handled improperly. A columnist wrote that the giant wheel had been unusually philosophical, which made three tram drivers in three different districts laugh at exactly the same minute, not because they had read the column, but because the wheel\u2019s small squeal in the cold had hit a note that felt like gossip. A talk radio host made the mistake of saying someone\u2019s name in the wrong spirit while describing a kitchen, and an hour later the studio found a damp luxuriance blooming under a light switch in the shape of a continent that did not exist. He took the hint and referred thereafter to \u201cthe arithmetic pilgrim\u201d and \u201cthe woman with the stubborn towel,\u201d which worked about as well as cheap maps work in fog.\n\nThere was a letter slid under the door that looked like a bill and smelled like discretion. The office that watched the oath had printed on municipal stock a thank-you that doubled as a warning. It suggested that kitchens, when asked to officiate, would henceforth be afforded the same protections as public monuments, with a footnote explaining that public monuments should try, when possible, not to sulk if draped briefly in scarves. It reminded all named parties in polite small type that in public spaces they must call each other \u201cthe petitioner\u201d and \u201cthe respondent\u201d or, failing that, \u201cthe person\u201d and \u201cthe other person,\u201d and that if they forgot, mildew would decide to take interest in the undersides of their wooden chairs. The letter offered a number to call in case mildew became ideological rather than housekeeping, which made Petra snort coffee ground-fine through her nose when she read it and earned the paper a place on the fridge until the magnet it clung to developed a sense of entitlement and slid off.\n\nMagda\u2019s phone swarmed with messages written by people who were not quite sure what they had witnessed and wanted to be certain they had not been the only ones. There were congratulations that tried to be unassuming and failed, admonitions that tried to sound intimate and tripped, and one exquisite note from a woman who wrote simply that she had for the first time in years refused to clap when asked even though clapping had been her habit and had kissed her husband in the doorway instead, because doorways had felt promoted. There were also two requests for appointments, one about a set of keys that had started to lock their owner out from the inside, another concerning a music box that played a march in reverse on Tuesday evenings and had begun, disconcertingly, to make a child\u2019s footprints appear in flour.\n\nShe boiled water and made tea because coffee would have joined the morning too fast and tea was better at easing itself into a room and asking where the chairs liked to stand. The cat leapt onto the table in a movement that gave the lie to gravity and sat with the purposeful nonchalance of a foreman regulating a crew. It examined the stove, blammed its eyes at the window where a small feather had lodged between glass and frame, and then looked at her with that specific attention which means: I have been listening to the neighbors through the pipes and three of them were very unwise after midnight. \u201cI am not here to scold anyone\u2019s pleasure,\u201d Magda said, and the cat flattened its ears in agreement that pleasure belongs to itself until it knocks asking at the wrong hour.\n\nPetra arrived before noon with two loaves tucked under her arm and, in her coat pocket, a small roll of blue tape used by film crews to make the world behave for twenty minutes. She moved like someone who had slept on the couch and dreamed in straight lines for once. They kissed each other\u2019s cheeks in the doorway without chatter because routine had a beauty that did not like to be decorated. \u201cBruno asked if you would autograph his fee,\u201d Petra said, setting the bread down and turning her mug upright with the tenderness of a person who has loved and scolded a country into remembering how to be kind. \u201cI told him that money is already an autograph and if he wanted more I would sign his shoe with a word that would embarrass him by its accuracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are going to make a version,\u201d Magda said, and what she meant was the show, the office, the city, the friends they had not chosen; all the entities that love an instance enough to turn it into a pattern and then to a brand. \u201cThey will ask kitchens to act natural and build sets that break your hip because realism measures differently on a spreadsheet. They will ask coffee to confess. They will sell the way onions brown.\u201d\n\nPetra tore a crust off the loaf and spoke into the crumb as if addressing a microphone with good manners. \u201cThen we can be provincial about it,\u201d she said. \u201cNo exports. The clause says one winter. The clause says the width of this table. Anyone who brings a crew into a kitchen without first obtaining permission from the towel will find themselves making soup with water that refuses to boil and parsley that declines to be chopped.\u201d She swallowed, caught the cat trotting past with something crinkled in its mouth, and liberated the object, which proved to be another strip of foil embossed with stars that had escaped a chocolate. \u201cHe has begun to tithe,\u201d she said, her voice admiring and affronted in equal measure. \u201cHe thinks the apartment is a temple and he is its complicated god.\u201d\n\nThey walked out into the day because staying in would have taught the curtains to expect attention, and curtains with expectations become tyrants. The city had put on a pale blue and looked faintly cropped at its edges, as if some hand had trimmed the day to fit the frame of an old print. On the corner, a woman sold chestnuts that did not taste burned enough to be fashionable, which made them perfect. A bus sighed at a stop and confessed to three pigeons that it had been thinking about the mountains. Children had invented a chant that could get you in trouble in some places and a free sandwich in others. \u201cCabin seven, kitchen eleven,\u201d they shouted, without knowing or caring what eleven had to do with anything; it rhymed and let the feet cut air into pieces, and that was enough.\n\nNear the Prater they encountered the operator of the wheel varnishing a small section of wood as if applying balm to an old bruise. He nodded at them with the polite indifference of a person charged with caring for a thing that cannot repay him except by continuing to be itself. His moustache had been white since the last time any of them had thought they were forever. \u201cGood working,\u201d he said to Magda in the way of tradespeople who dislike making compliments into events. \u201cIt takes a particular wrist to get a thing built for forward motion to listen to something going on in a kitchen. She,\u201d he added with a tilt meant to include the wheel and the city and the operator\u2019s mother tongue and the current winter, \u201cwas proud to be asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe insists we come again, very possibly with soup,\u201d Magda said, and the man grunted, which in wheelhouse dialect meant I will make the joints not squeal the next time if I can and not let the men with the signboards crowd too near the axle. Petra, without looking up, pressed her thumb to the balustrade and traced a circle she did not finish because old men with varnish notice things and she did not wish to be thought disrespectful. Somewhere behind them a tourist explained to another tourist that the wheel had once been dismantled and rebuilt and had decided not to bear a grudge.\n\nBy afternoon the forums had stacked themselves into a precarious architecture of opinion and rumor. Users with avatars depicting saints of their own invention composed long posts about the halving of scope and the way place had been invited to have a vote. One pseudonymous voice with a tone of ferocity disguised as grace wrote that the kitchen moment had been the first time she had watched the city be permitted to address its citizens without an intermediary, and she suspected the city had enjoyed it. Another, on a board frequented by men who liked to pass off nostalgia as policy, warned darkly that allowing places to speak would only embolden teapots to file petitions. A debate flared for twenty minutes about whether mildew was a classist penalty and whether chairs in poor neighborhoods would suffer disproportionately, and then subsided into a thread about which brand of soap offends saints the least.\n\nAt the office where the oath was kept in drawers and on rooftops, a meeting unspooled with fewer speeches than usual and more silence that did not embarrass itself. A man who had inherited his position from a woman who had not believed in inheritance said that they would tolerate kitchens as officiants so long as the rooms in question had at least one window, because rooms without windows make people say forever, and forever is a word that cannot afford to be shouted. A woman whose handwriting resembled a ladder wrote in the margin of a memo that they should set aside a small fund to repair table legs, not because of sentiment but because you cannot ask a piece of wood to hold up that much law and not splint it later. No one suggested making it a show segment. The office had learned long ago that when it tried to stage its own ceremonies the city laughed very gently and documents went missing from inside of things that did not have insides.\n\nMagda collected three new tasks by simply walking down Mariahilfer Stra\u00dfe. One woman needed help persuading a pair of boots to agree that they belonged to this century and not to a grandfather who had walked himself into a war and out again with his smile rearranged. Another had brought home from a flea market a mirror so sure of its own opinion that it had refused to show her face unless she sang a particular lullaby, which she did not know and did not wish to hum in front of her bathroom because bathrooms remember. A third asked whether Magda could unstick the word please from the throat of her daughter, who had been born with ease but had learned in school that asking paints a target on your back. Magda said she could try the boots and would speak to the mirror and offered to teach the daughter how to use maybe instead and to set please aside for special occasions and persons of substance.\n\nTheir path took them past the caf\u00e9 where two years ago a woman wearing yellow had told Magda that she was tired of being told that all the city wanted from her was her prettiest sigh. The same barista, a man with forearms like melted clock faces and a devotion to crema that suggested religion without rules, glanced up and gave them both a nod that not many people received, a rare species of benediction in this city that has learned to hoard them without malice. \u201cTwo,\u201d he said, setting saucers like laws, \u201cfor the people who make rooms change their minds.\u201d He then left them to it, as is proper when a gift is too subtle to be accompanied by commentary.\n\nThey spoke of naming because the penalty for public slip now had claws and humor. Petra referred to the other woman as the one with the out-of-season cherry pits, which made Magda laugh for the first time since the wheel had said hold. Magda confessed that she had almost said the name in the hallway to the inspector with the spoon and had only saved them both from mildew by swallowing the word like fishbone and then telling the wall she was sorry to be theatrical in the morning. Petra looked around the caf\u00e9, at chairs that point to one another like accomplices and tables that have learned to ignore all but the most vivid flirtations, and said they must agree on euphemisms and change them regularly the way spies used to change train stations. They shook hands solemnly on calling her the arithmetic pilgrim when in public and the pilgrim when they were in rooms that could bear eavesdropping. They agreed to call Magda the towel\u2019s keeper when needed, and both of them enjoyed the way that sounded more dangerous than not.\n\nThe cat found them at the caf\u00e9, as it could in most places not explicitly infused with peppermint. It arrived at the exact height of the pane of glass most vulnerable to noseprints and made one, then sat on the outside table as if daring the city to pass a regulation. A crow hopped behind it and deposited a nail with intention, a small iron declaration of fealty, or perhaps barter. The cat accepted, chewed the nail in a way that would have horrified a dentist and pleased an ancestor, and then tucked it under the belly as if sitting on treasure in the only fashion available to a creature without pockets. The crow gave them both a look suggesting appreciation of the compact and then flew off, its wings spelling a word that Magda could read only if she stopped pretending to be modern.\n\nBy late afternoon, a municipal envelope with a two-headed stamp waited under the door asking to be let in. It was thick in the way of communications that intend to invoke a weight beyond their stock. Inside, a notice declared that, for the duration of one winter and for the radius defined by a table and a stove, her kitchen had been designated a venue of record for the oath\u2019s amended domestic clause. There was a paragraph about fire exits that made sense even if you disapproved of exits on principle, a stipulation concerning the presence of beings whose legal status fluctuated with the phase of the moon, and a list of small compensations the city would pay without making her ask, which meant a man would arrive with a notebook and large ears and pay her less than she deserved while trying not to be ashamed of the arithmetic. There was also a line to sign where she would agree to accept the public when it came and to refuse it in a manner that did not produce riots in the stairwell.\n\n\u201cPrepare to have your Tuesdays eaten by disputes over tongs,\u201d Petra said, reading over her shoulder and stretching her arms like a strongwoman considering whether to lift the refrigerator or persuade it to admit defeat. \u201cThey will bring tupperware with their grudges and ask the room to tell them where the leak is in their marriage. The city will adore it because it means fewer police reports in the evening and more satisfied small gods.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will be hungry,\u201d Magda said, and she wasn\u2019t talking about soup. The letter made a neat folding sound when she tamed it back into its sleeve. \u201cI will do what I can without allowing the towel to get ideas. And if the mildew comes because I forget and say pilgrim to a wall that loves rumors, you will come and scold the drawer until it dries in a decent frame of mind.\u201d\n\nThe first supplicants came not on a Tuesday but on a Sabbath disguised as Wednesday. A pair of brothers holding between them a box of biscuits too sweet for honest adults asked to use the kitchen to settle whether the earth had a sense of humor about their father\u2019s will. A woman with a baby asleep against her and cheeks that declared loudly that she never again intended to be asked to prove anything requested a space where she could tell a question to sit outside while she held her newborn up to be greeted by four corners and a drain who would forgive what it was asked to swallow later. A violinist with eyebrows like quotation marks asked if the stove would consider offering him an alibi for the night his bow had played a tune in a woman's window that did not belong to him. Magda took down names for her private book and not for the office\u2019s book and scheduled the ones that smelled like sincerity before the ones that smelled like performance, and when the door closed after each life had entered and left, she washed the handles as if the city had breathed into her hands and required a gentle forgetting.\n\nEvenings were different now because the air looked at her with work in mind. The crew returned to retrieve two cables they had sworn they had not left and to apologize to the cupboard for calling it stubborn when it had merely been conservative. The soundman with the shell ears brought a tin of shortbread as an offering, which Petra devoured with the fatalism of a woman resigned to falling in love with butter yet again, and the woman with the clipboard sat at the table after her shift and quietly wrote down, for her own peace, the number of times she had witnessed kindness without permission from a schedule. She said nothing aloud about any of it because she had learned that when you spoke about kindness in committees, men argued about definitions and invited hats to be passed.\n\nThe arithmetic pilgrim remained visible without being named, which is one of the city\u2019s specialities. She went on the radio and talked about measures and sports and the mercy of being allowed to be obvious in a world that insists on cleverness. She gave interviews to newspapers nobody read on purpose and to one paper everyone bought because they liked the crossword, and in both she argued that making room for place to moderate was innovation disguised as sentimentality. She did not say Magda\u2019s name. She called her \u201cthe respondent\u201d once and then, with impeccable care, never again, as if the word had cut her lip. A rumor, oiled and sleek, glided across the internet that she was establishing a school for people who liked to answer quickly and to take audience and air into account equally, and this would be either a noble thing or a horror depending on whether she installed windows in the rooms.\n\nOn a night when the moon had not made up its mind about light, a young man knocked at the door and asked whether she accepted parcels from archives. He had the apologetic shoulders of someone sent by a superior who had not explained that apologies are sometimes worse than silence. He handed over a flat package wrapped in brown paper stamped with the municipal crest and the symbol of a fishhook bent into a question mark but not in wax this time, in ink so dark it looked like a bruise. Inside lay a folio of copies, nothing original you could breathe on and make change its mind, and within those copies a tracing of a page from a book Magda had seen once when she was young and had believed that dusty rooms would always be patient with her. The tracing showed the seal she already knew\u2014hooked fish, question\u2014but around it a ring of careful drawings of the letter D, repeated in as many hands as could be found in the archive in the year something had fallen down and hit a bureaucrat in the softest part of his heart.\n\nThere were notes in her teacher\u2019s unsentimental hand that confirmed what the underworld of memos had suggested: the mark went back to an older association than television and a newer wickedness than empire. It belonged to a guild that had never declared itself fully because it preferred to be invited out like a ghost, and its various names all had to do with asking and collecting and the prying open of answers with grace and force alternately. The name that felt least like a pose and most like an admission was the Dowsers, which would have been ridiculous if not for the fact that in this city you could find underground water with a wire coat hanger and a headache if you knew how to listen. Below the ring of D\u2019s, a phrase had been rubbed out and then rewritten, as if someone had regretted their ink and demanded second chances of the page. The phrase read: The question that yields to one who asks with hunger owes a debt to the place that has held it, and if the place refuses, the question must be worn like a stone around the neck until it softens.\n\nShe showed the folio to Petra because secrets fare better when stored in two bodies, particularly when one of those bodies belongs to a woman who can lift an unwieldy truth without creating a drama about her own biceps. They traced the notes with their eyes and made small maps of the city in the air above the table. They named corners where questions had drained away by themselves and corners where people loved to ask and rarely answered. They discussed whether the arithmetic pilgrim wore the ring with the fishhook as an advertisement or as a debt owed to hands she had shaken, and whether she had been taught to flick her eyes by people who preferred rooms with no soft furniture.\n\nThe cat interrupted by dragging a small object into the middle of the paper and dropping it with the complex pride of a creature who has brought you a thing that is not edible but important. It was a button made of smoke-coloured glass, the kind you find in old tins in old drawers in kitchens that have known both good and unkind women. In the button was embedded a hair, black and fine, and around the hole a faint scratch the exact shape of a letter the city refuses to pronounce when in a good mood. Magda picked it up and held it to the light and watched as the glass decided whether or not to be honest about what it had seen. \u201cHe has learned to collect witnesses,\u201d Petra said, looking at the cat with affection and a smidgeon of terror because it is disorienting when your familiar begins to do the work of small archivists unasked.\n\nThe second invitation arrived in a fashion that introduced itself as polite and proved otherwise. There was no wax this time and no seal, only a note that had carried through so many rooms to reach her that it had become a traveller. It smelled of train stations and a cologne that wants to be a poem. The paper asked her presence at a gathering of the association hinted at in the tracing, in a hall whose address was given as the place where once men had sold three types of rope and an argument to go with each. It promised that if she came, she would be allowed to ask one question and to answer none. It warned, with a kind of courtliness that scratched at the skin, that if she refused, a question would be sent to her house anyway and would insist on being answered by the things there that could not claim professionalism.\n\nMagda put the note down and picked up the folio again and then put both away because objects sometimes conspire if you leave them touching. She walked to the window and watched a bicycle decide bravely to be a vehicle even in snow that had ripened into slush. She was not in the habit of going into rooms that had a surplus of tweed and a deficit of sunlight. She understood that if she refused, the thing would not end but would come knocking like anything that wants to make you declare that you do or do not belong. She was able to admit to herself without drama that she had always been supple to invitations and extra resistant to summons.\n\nPetra stood and stretched and rolled her shoulders as if warming up to carry somebody else\u2019s mistake. \u201cIf you go,\u201d she said, \u201cI will walk you there without walking into the room. I will count the steps to the doorway and memorize them. I will plant coins in the street along the way for luck, which you will pretend to find casually. I will hang my coat on the nearest lion carved out of something complicated and ask it to watch for changes in your face when you come out.\u201d She laid her large hands out on the table and pressed her palms to the wood that had officiated and decided that if anyone in that hall put their hand where it didn\u2019t belong, the hall itself would have second thoughts. \u201cIf you do not go, there will be an envelope arrived at a terrible time and a bread you are baking will fall.\u201d\n\nThe cat had opinions but had decided to package them in a shape that would not immediately make anyone leave the room. It jumped into Magda\u2019s lap, turned itself into a loop of warm fur the exact geometry of eight, and purred off-key until the decision changed tone. The sound reached a place in Magda\u2019s chest that made her think of being thirteen again and telling herself rules with salt and coins and the number of steps on a bridge. She knew that she would go because the way the letter was written had annoyed her into curiosity, and curiosity, when poked, repays the bother by carrying you into rooms where history keeps its old toothbrush in a glass by the sink.\n\nThe hall, when they reached it, was in disguise the way old buildings are when they wish to be polite to those who\u2019ve come to scrape their money against a counter and go away with rope and disputation. The front had been painted the shade of neutrality that permits a shop to sell both paint thinner and advice, and only the door-knocker, an iron fish mid-sulk, betrayed the house\u2019s appetite. Petra set coins in the cracks between stones with such casual artistry that three pigeons made approving noises. She counted the steps not to the door but to the nearest shadow big enough to hide a regret in. Magda knocked the way you knock when you are inviting yourself to confess.\n\nInside it smelled like dust that had chosen friends among books instead of floors, and like wine that had been opened in the afternoon by someone thinking about the pace of their own heartbeat. The room had three long tables and many chairs and a clerk with a chin like a plinth. The association had assembled themselves in the clothes they wear when they know they may be asked to stand and be admired while pretending not to mind the draft. Rings gleamed in good taste and in lack of it. A woman with a scar along her eyebrow the shape of a scythe leaned against a radiator with the warmth of a person who arranges temperatures for a living. A man in a sweater with elbow patches the exact tone of his skepticism unfolded his arms and refolded them in a way that gave the impression of generosity without requiring him to offer it.\n\nThey greeted her by not greeting her, which is the manner of groups that prefer to watch you take your first steps on their floor and judge whether or not you are likely to embarrass their rug. She decided to be rude in a way that is perceived, in certain circles, as elegance. She nodded to the clerk as if they shared a private misgiving about the invoices, touched the radiator as if introducing the bones in her hands to its iron, and then looked neither left nor right but at the ceiling, because ceilings in such rooms hold more honest opinions than the painting does. The ceiling was cracked the way skin cracks in winter and then pretends it is fine in spring, and it had patched itself with careful attention, which meant someone here was capable of maintenance without fanfare.\n\nThe arithmetic pilgrim was absent and present both. Her name was not said and not permitted, and somehow every absence in the room arranged itself as if keeping a chair free for a person who had already decided whether to sit. The clerk gave Magda a token shaped like a drop of water and told her she could ask one question of place and not of person and that if she asked the wrong one the place would call it wrong by arranging everyone\u2019s coughs into a verdict. He added, with an amusement that fit his chin, that if she attempted to leave without partaking of their bread and their overly earnest cheese, the door would seize up and require a mechanic with intentions.\n\nShe considered the room and where it had learned to stand, considered the floorboards and the years that had taught them to remain unbroken when men in boots or women in newly-heel-bearing shoes marched in with law extending just behind them like a pale. She had half a mind to ask the table what had been signed on it that should not have been, and the other half to ask the radiator what it had overheard about water and fire. Instead she breathed and did what she had taught herself to do in kitchens and cabins: she asked the room what question would make it feel that it had been treated like a person and not a stage.\n\n\u201cWhat would you like me to ask,\u201d she said softly, letting the words use the parts of her mouth that most like soup. \u201cAnd what are you tired of hearing. And what, if answered, would make you permit this association to claim that they have a right, however temporary, to whisper?\u201d The clerk smiled not displeased. The elbow-patched man arranged his face to conceal his intimacy with the concept of relief. The woman by the radiator watched her fingers as if admiring the uncomplaining competence of tendons. The room answered in the airy voice of plaster and like all old houses it added a complaint because complaining is a right earned by seeing too much.\n\n\u201cAsk if they are willing to pay in silence,\u201d it said, and its words, though not lawyerly, had the careful structure of someone who has been talked over and has decided to pull out a different chair. \u201cAsk whether they will give you a season in which they do not ask and only allow the city to ask them to be kind. Ask them whether they will leave one corner empty in all their rooms where a person who does not like questions can hide and not be smoked out. Ask whether they are as good at receiving as they are at prying.\u201d The ceiling cracked its knuckles in satisfaction as if it had finally been invited to its own party. The radiator approved by not hissing, which is as loud as radiators get when expressing contentment.\n\nMagda turned to the assembled and asked the room\u2019s question because intermediaries have their obligations too. The association, caught unready by being asked to consider and not to promise cunning things, looked at one another and, like all organisms that wish to survive, made a plan so fast that plan looked like character. The clerk cleared his throat and did not perform: he said that yes, they would say nothing for a season and see if a different skill, one less applauded, did in fact exist in them. The man with elbow patches looked pained and agreed with his eyebrows. The woman by the radiator nodded, the nod of someone conjugating a verb she had been avoiding. Someone in the back whispered that the mildew penalty for naming had been effective and perhaps should be expanded to include insulting particular benches, and the room downstairs, which had a bench with pride but not vanity, twitched its leg in warning.\n\nThey offered her the bread and the cheese as threatened. She ate both politely. They poured her wine that had wanted to be better but had learned pragmatism and that grape\u2019s particular humility. The clerk gave her a paper like a recipe that set down the season of silence and the empty corner rule and an address to which she could send any small gods found in jars on Thursdays. Then, because she had accepted their bread, she did as courtesy demanded and asked them for a single thing in return that would not reveal hunger but would remind their bodies later that their mouths had been honest. She asked for the map of those who kept the ring with the fishhook close, not their names or their domiciles, because names and addresses are for police and letter carriers, but the pattern of what places they preferred, what weather they coveted, and at what hour they liked to commit their questions to paper. The clerk, who liked accurate maps more than most, glanced at the ceiling, which cracked once in approval, and said yes.\n\nOutside, Petra exhaled the temperature of the visitor\u2019s hall and pushed a coin with her boot into a crack that had not been there when they arrived. \u201cYou were long but not too long,\u201d she said, which amounted to a public laurel in her register. \u201cThe lion says five men pretended not to know how to lean, and two women pretended not to notice them pretending. There is a man in the third-story window across the street who is very good at reading backward and has been reading a book that was not written in that order. I told him to mind his business with my eyebrows.\u201d\n\nThey walked toward the canal because the canal thinks better of people who use it to wash thoughts rather than to shove them from one bank to another. Snow had given up its career ambitions for the week and fallen back into being weather; it gathered respectfully along the railings and avoided accusing pedestrians of insufficient romance. On the bridge, a boy threw a handful of something into the air and watched as it became not enough confetti and too much dust. He looked at Magda with the specific gravity assigned to adults who sometimes know the secret rules and said that he had seen her on a thing and then had watched a kettle and discovered that kettles were not merely appliances but instruments. She thanked him in a language that does not make boys feel managed, and he nodded, satisfied to have been recognized by a correct vowel.\n\nHer kitchen looked at her when she returned the way kitchens do when you bring in too many stories: it assessed the load-bearing capacity of the table and suggested a stew. Petra hung her coat and announced that she would nap for forty minutes like a soldier and be woken with cruelty in case the city wanted to run again. The cat, having successfully pilfered another button from somewhere no one would admit to, hid it behind the sugar, which pretended not to notice even while cataloguing the weight and the scratch. A small flyer had come under the door advertising a new thing: a man at the market was selling black sweets molded in the shape of a question mark fish, dusted with sugar so they looked like they had been dredged through a conversation. The price was affordable, which meant there was a plan to make back the loss on something else, and Magda smiled because the city had already begun metabolizing the spectacle into treats and trinkets. That was better than it being turned into doctrine, which makes bad bread and worse neighbors.\n\nNight came and brought with it neither dread nor rest, something in-between that Magda had learned to inventory without impatience. She turned the clocks to face out again because she had guests coming tomorrow and guests feel untrusted when time is told to avert its gaze. She wrote two invoices and threw them away because she had used too much righteousness in the phrasing; then she wrote them again in the voice of a person who knows that payment is not the same as gratitude and that insisting otherwise ruins soup. She set aside a place on a shelf for the jar the technicians would bring if they found spirits inside her outlets, and she spoke aloud to the outlets because electrical entities prefer to be addressed before they are inspected. She told them that if they had sheltered any stray whispers out of pity for a threadbare argument, now was the time to send them into the stairwell to choose different doors.\n\nShe slept at last, not the sleep of the unbothered but one of those municipal rests you get when a city has promised you that, for a few hours, it will keep your name out of papers and your streetlamp lit. In her dream she took the tram to the end of the line and discovered that the last stop was an enormous pot placed on a square in which onions browned to applause. She woke to the cat kneading her shoulder with intent that was affectionate and legislative, and to the sound of a trolley somewhere being asked to apologize by a track. She brewed coffee because tea is for mending, and this morning was for soldering. She set out cups because people would come and ask her to be precise without being sharp, and she could do that for the length of this winter and the width of this table and not longer.\n\nThe bell rang once and did not ring a second time. No one stood in the doorway when she opened it, which did not make her suspicious because absence is this city\u2019s most practiced trick. On the mat lay a small box wrapped in paper democratic enough to have contained meat or poetry. She brought it inside, checked it for municipal rats and divine sarcasm, found none, and unwrapped it with the care you give a gift from someone who does not know yet whether to apologize. Inside lay flour packed around an object wrapped again in cloth. She pulled back the cloth and found a loaf shaped like a question mark, proofed and baked with skill somewhere between old village hands and new city nerve. Under it there was a card with no name and three words written in a script she recognized at once because she had seen it move through lights like a snake learning to speak. The three words read: Next: your bridge.\n\nShe stared at the bread until its heat made the paper humble. She felt the hinge in her jaw where unkindness likes to hide click into place and then relax because she would not allow it space this morning. Bridge was not only a place in Vienna with a view and history; it was a thing you build to join shores that pretend to want distance. It was also a term in certain rooms for the interim between scenes when you allow the audience to breathe and then decide whether to clap or leave. She understood at once twelve meanings and knew there were thirty more. She understood that there would be a move to take the proceedings out of kitchens and out of wheels and onto the skin of the city\u2019s most public arches, where wind has opinions and pigeons possess rights. She understood that she would have to say yes if the invitation invoked something older than her refusal and that she would have to bring Petra because bridges, like kitchens, do not tolerate loneliness well.\n\nShe sliced the bread and smelled a joke braided into its crumb. It had been baked by someone who knew sugar is impolite in rye unless it is made to apologize with salt. She ate a piece and decided to keep the rest in case a bridge had a taste for symbolism later and could be bribed. She put the card with the three words on the high shelf because things above your line of sight have less power over your day than things below it. The cat jumped up and batted the card once and then let it be because even cats know that some games are better played with witnesses.\n\nPetra came in then, hair in a braid that had slept and woken more dignified than most people do. She saw the bread, read the three words, and made a face that in her dialect meant both we expected this and I was hoping for a different act. \u201cGood,\u201d she said, pouring coffee into cups that had long ago agreed to be identically chipped. \u201cLet her take the air and see if it will side with anyone who talks to it like a pet. I will bring rope and I will not tell you why until I need to.\u201d She sat and dunked her bread with the seriousness of a theologian practicing mischief. \u201cYou will wear a hat because bridges are vain and like it when their visitors dress for the occasion. And you will ask the city, at the top, to please between now and then avoid breaking any old men's hips, because bridges like to make their points in ways that make new widows, and I am tired of that drama.\u201d\n\nMagda nodded and felt the city turn its head toward them because it enjoys being asked to play fair when everyone expects it to be only romantic and cruel. She wrote a note to the office that watched the oath with two sentences that said six things; she sent Petra out to buy mustard because soup without mustard would make the day less honest; she ran a hand along the towel and thanked it for its lineage and asked it to tolerate more elbows. She did not say arithmetic or pilgrim or any proper names at all. She said bridge out loud because saying it taught her mouth how the air would feel when she stood where the invitation wanted her to stand. She believed, because belief is a traitor and a servant both, that place would not refuse her if she arrived hungry and wearing a hat that made a bridge feel taller. She put the bread on a plate because even jokes deserve to be served and not eaten from paper when they are trying to be metaphors, and she waited for the city to drop its next hint in the bowl by the door where coins and keys sleep between errands.Chapter 10\n\nThe day the bridge took up residence in her mouth began with sensible shoes and a superstition she thought she\u2019d retired. She dressed for the air as if it were a particular aunt\u2014affectionate, prone to comment, tender to hats\u2014and she set out with Petra to walk the city\u2019s spans the way you visit elders before making a decision that will obligate your knees. A notice from the office had been hand-delivered at dawn by a boy in municipal blue who had the look of a person dignified by errands; it stipulated that the officiant must be of sound footing, that the river be in a mood to listen, that railings be briefed against grandstanding, and that the amended clause about feeding witnesses be observed with sincerity and spoons that did not snap under moral weight. A stamp on the notice bore two arches with a small fishhook between them, which meant either someone had a sense of humor at City Hall or the association had discovered self-awareness and was trying it on.\n\nThey started with the small bridges over the canal because practice is kinder on modest architecture. Schwedenbr\u00fccke hunkered in its coat of traffic and steel like a person willing to be touched but not hugged; it tolerated questions the way bank clerks tolerate the lunch hour. Augartenbr\u00fccke was easier; it breathed and remembered lovers who had made of its midspan a private pronoun and children who had dropped marbles into the water to see whether the river spoke the language of games. Friedensbr\u00fccke, when they reached it, looked at Magda the way old friends look at you when they are practicing not saying I told you so. It had known her feet once when she had believed that counting could keep death polite, and it did not hold the belief against her. It had a broad back and a practical soul, which is an underrated quality in officiants.\n\n\u201cYours,\u201d Petra said, not because the bridge had put out a mat with her name on it but because the air took that particular texture people acquire when they have made room for a person to be braver than yesterday. There were stains on the girders shaped like the handprints of weather; there were pigeons in their correct number, neither too many to invite contempt nor too few to worry priests. The water below behaved; it had been sullen lately, winter having made it heavy, but today it had the resigned efficiency of a waiter in a caf\u00e9 where the coffee is never sent back. Magda set her palm against the parapet and felt the same small slow thrum she remembered from when she was thirteen and her bones were new to a city that believed in its own spine.\n\nThe office brought its devices and courtesies at noon. The inspector with the spoon, now a minor celebrity in his own circles, set a bowl against the wind and forced it to respect the old experiment; the spoon did not even twitch when the first dumb question was asked over the canal by a clerk practicing for television, which made two men in hi-vis jackets beam like uncles. A woman with a coil of bright rope and a notebook came to measure everything that might be measured and marked out a rectangle of witness on the east side where the light would not insult cameras into making art. She listened gravely when Petra asked for anchor points and then watched with professional interest as Petra looped her rope around a lamppost and a parapet as if she were teaching the bridge a knot that a boat would approve of without becoming sentimental. A placard went up at the north approach, drawing its authority from the kind of font that assures you doctors are involved: Oath of Contest, Domestic Amendment in Effect, Officiant: Friedensbr\u00fccke, Witnesses Must Be Available for Soup.\n\nWord had spread without anyone having to push it. In Vienna rumors commute for free and often arrive before you do with your bag. By midafternoon women with strong handbags and men with ordinary minds and clever children had begun to pause, calculate the probable time of the spectacle, and make shopping lists accordingly. Bruno, clutching an offensively small notebook and wearing a respectably subdued hat, tried to insinuate himself into the crew by claiming his great-uncle had once oiled a bolt on the same span, then thought better of it when Petra folded her arms and let her hands communicate, without recourse to verbs, the shape of the fee for men with notebooks. The clipboard woman appeared like a grant come in under budget, hair braided with duty, and reviewed the tape marked along the pavement as if it were a new policy on rights-of-way and not a gesture of prudence towards a bridge with a sense of its own dignity.\n\nThe arithmetic pilgrim sent no envelope this time because addresses had become superfluous; still, just before four, a car that enjoyed thinking of itself as a carriage arrived, and she disembarked with the economy of a person who knows that stairs pay attention. Her coat had learned the art of not being an event; it worried the edges of its own elegance but did not apologize, and her thumb ring made its narrow address on her hand like a commentary you cannot disagree with without looking petty. She took in the rope, the soup cauldrons\u2014two, braced on gas rings lugged up from the kitchen by a crew who had decided to enjoy being useful today\u2014the bowl and spoon, the municipal faces, the river. She smiled into the air with the minimum of teeth necessary to say: I see you seeing me; give me a second to make you comfortable with that fact.\n\n\u201cI have brought no wire,\u201d she said, pitching the line to carry to the places that matter\u2014the operator standing half-disguised behind a kiosk, the clipboard, the inspector, the bridge\u2014and three pigeons made skeptical noises in unison because pigeons believe in evidence, not promises. Her crew followed behind with less arrogance than last night, subdued by something that had not been part of any training-day module: the knowledge of being permitted on sufferance by a thing with rivets. The camera lowered its head like a penitent altar boy and blinked at the water with an expression that could be read as humility if you had learned how to ascribe virtue to machines.\n\n\u201cHat,\u201d Petra said softly, and Magda, who had chosen hers at noon with the seriousness of someone choosing a tone, put it on. It was sensible but not hostile to compliments, with a small ribbon whose behavior could be described as moral. The wind considered it on her and agreed not to make trouble unless she was rude. She adjusted the brim, set the ladle where it could do its duty with some flourish, and stepped to the chalk line that had been laid down between two patches of salt as if the city were making a recipe it refused to write down.\n\nWhen the hour came, it did not announce itself with bells so much as with a tightening in the air common to theatres and courts and kitchens where apologies are about to be offered. People arranged their faces into expressions they believed would be flattering in the memories of others; children corrected them. The inspector tested the silence a final time and nodded to the bridge the way you nod to someone you have agreed to call by their first name for the duration of a project. The bridge hummed once, a sound you could feel in your ankles more than your ears, and the camera flinched, which endeared it to three electricians and one saint.\n\n\u201cDeclare span,\u201d the bridge said, speaking through its iron and concrete, every stress line suddenly a throat. The voice had that quality old metal has in winter\u2014warmed by the friction of weather, slowed by thought. \u201cDeclare footings. Declare weight allowable without damage to dignity.\u201d The officiant had no time for nonsense, but its tolerance for ordinary human attempts made of those present an assembly of the correct size. Magda was grateful all at once for having learned to be polite to stairs as a child; bridges, like stairs, can be asked to be kind if you remember they are not there for you.\n\n\u201cNorth to south,\u201d she said, \u201cwith room for waste and the trumpet of impatience. Footings in the facts men poured in good moods and bad. Weight to include velvet and the way people pretend not to look when lovers fight.\u201d She let the grammar wear its boots. The arithmetic pilgrim, without attempting to improve on it, added her declaratives as if offering the officiant a bouquet without the embarrassment of flowers. \u201cFrom the city that calls itself first to the one that acts like it,\u201d she said, naming the districts in the old way that counts bridges as a kind of jewelry. \u201cFootings in losses we agreed to forget. Weight to include ratings, friction, and the privilege of having come farther than anyone expected.\u201d\n\nThe bridge accepted both, as though its ledger had a column labeled generosity. The camera\u2019s light moved from green to a meek red, and the inspector\u2019s spoon stayed polite. The river decided not to show off with a floating branch performing dramatics. The voice that had held the quiz show together arrived late, as if having run from an appointment, and tried to sound as if it had always lived in girders; it did a respectable job for something that had been designed to sell adverts between competition and haircut. \u201cContest resumes,\u201d it said, reading off a sheet that had been dampened by the weather and hardened by policy. \u201cOfficiant: Friedensbr\u00fccke. Scope public and elevated. Wire denied. Audience disarmed of sharp derision and permitted warm commentary. Witnesses to be fed first. Petitioners to speak as issued.\u201d\n\nMagda knew the bridge would not want theatrics dressed as questions. This was a place that preferred practical confessions to prettified lies, surefooted nouns to the kind of adjectives that make boys write songs. She felt the thrum under her hand with the exactness of a metronome that has been influenced by love. The first question rose not from the ceiling of a cabin this time but from the river itself, which is the city\u2019s memory cooled into a habit. \u201cWhat did counting do,\u201d it asked, and the water slapped the pier in a rhythm that was almost kind to memory. \u201cWhen you put numbers between yourself and sorrow, what did you build. Did the bridge help.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made time put its foot precisely and refrain from running,\u201d she said, and the answer was neither elegant nor hungry, which pleased the air. \u201cIt gave me something to tell my bones to do that wasn\u2019t thinking about lemon and the thing the disinfectant couldn\u2019t cover. It did not help my mother stay; it helped me not to drop. The bridge offered me an honest surface and the dignity of a tangent. It tolerated my small arithmetic without adjusting its own and I am grateful to it, which is not the same as saying I was right.\u201d\n\nThe arithmetic pilgrim listened in a manner more interesting than her practiced attentiveness; she did not tap her ring, and her eyes did not travel left for forbidden aid. The wind put a flat palm on her mouth as if to test whether it would be a friend to her voice. \u201cCounting makes a promise to your pride,\u201d she said, speaking to the river and to every city that had trained itself to pretend it can be measured without flattery. \u201cIt says you will not be caught unawares by the same drop twice. It\u2019s theatre you do for yourself that sometimes keeps you from looking down. I did not count. I learned to skip, and I lost things. I lost things and told myself the loss was speed.\u201d\n\nThe bridge liked the honesty of it in a way that admits bias; spans are constructed by people who trust numbers enough to risk poetry. The second question came in the voice of iron: \u201cDefine toll, in a century that has learned to pay without putting coins on a table.\u201d It was an ancient word bristling with modern teeth. The ring of witnesses sharpened their faces, and Petra, who could have answered in three dialects and a curse, rested her weight on both feet as if preparing to carry whatever came next.\n\n\u201cA toll is the price of not drowning,\u201d Magda said, because she had left fancy in the kitchen on purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s the bit you owe the thing that bears you, even if you pretend it owes you. It can be money, or it can be the promise to leave something on the far side that you picked up on the near, because not everything loves being carried. It is also a story you tell the ones behind you about the wind up here, so they come ready. In courts it is called court fees. In kitchens it is called washing up.\u201d She let herself smile, and three men nearby felt themselves become less ridiculous for having brought thermoses.\n\n\u201cThe toll is audience,\u201d the pilgrim said, and because she had chosen that as her instrument she paid in her own coin without apology. \u201cI cross because people hope to see me cross, and their hope makes the span less long. The price is I must go back and forth more times than I would if no one watched. The price is to be always observed and thus never unmade.\u201d She said it like a ledger entry, and the bridge, which had ledger in its bones and remembered every footstep like a numerator, allowed itself to be persuaded that audience could be a legitimate currency if not the only clean one.\n\nThe third question, as old as bridges and as new as paperless tickets, came from the underside, from the steel that only birds and vagrants look at. \u201cWhat will you refuse to carry across,\u201d it asked, and a train in the distance added its long opinion to the air. Magda thought of what she had seen dragged from bank to bank by people who believed distance fixed virtue. She thought of gossip disguised as mercy and mercy disguised as pity and pity disguised as a knife.\n\n\u201cCruelty that is proud of itself,\u201d she said. \u201cWeapons that have been disguised as etiquette. Promises that have been hollowed by practice. I will not carry proofs of other people\u2019s disappointments across as if they were trophies, and I will not carry my own righteousness when it is bigger than my hunger. I will carry sadness because it does not know better, and I will carry boredom because sometimes it is a virtue. I will not carry a wire, even if asked, even if told it is the modern way to cross.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegret performed for effect,\u201d the pilgrim said, and you could tell she had had to teach herself the difference between regret and rehearsal. \u201cSelf-pity in good clothes. Lies that improve ratings and break floors. The particular kind of contempt that is taught in certain rooms where men practice winning without eating afterward with the people they beat.\u201d She had chosen her refusals with care, and the crowd, which had learned this winter the taste of admission, found themselves willing to be moved by someone who had also been briefly willing to be small.\n\nA motion by the parapet, small enough to be plausibly accidental, made Petra\u2019s rope hand twitch. A young man with a device the color of indifference had been inviting a whisper to climb his sleeve; it hummed with that dry signature Magda had learned to hear in rooms that pretend to be silent. Before the inspector could be offended or the clipboard can pronounce the word violation with relish, the wind took a sudden interest in a flap of paper attached to the device. Petra did not make a scene, because scenes give wire confidence; she stepped as if retrieving a chestnut from an unwise pigeon and lifted the rope in a way that moved the young man and his hum and their hopes two meters south into a region where the city\u2019s superstition about unlucky numbers held jurisdiction. The hum met a cross-current, panicked, and slipped into the river with a small spark that the water politely ignored. The inspector marked something on a form with a line that suggested gratitude, and Magda sent some of hers down the rope into Petra\u2019s palm.\n\nIt was the bridge\u2019s turn to ask a local question, something in the way of house rules. \u201cFoot traffic has a right-of-way when weather and fear conspire to make running likely,\u201d it said, quoting its own private ordinance compiled from a hundred years of breath. \u201cUnder the amended clause, witnesses must be fed. Who feeds the bridge.\u201d It was not an accusation; it was a practical inquiry from a host who had learned belatedly to enjoy being thanked.\n\n\u201cWe feed you with names you are allowed to keep,\u201d Magda said. \u201cWith palms that carry warmth across. With the small humor of hats. With steps that touch and do not strike. With soup steam, if you consent. With the habit of saying thank you to the railings in winter without telling anyone we did it.\u201d She glanced at the cauldrons, where Petra and a girl from a bakery who had appointed herself spoon-handle-guardian were managing the delicacies of hot things near politics. They had chosen a soup with good intentions and better salt, and it was the kind of broth that makes witnesses respectable even when their opinions lean untidy.\n\n\u201cWith attention,\u201d the pilgrim said, and this time she kept it modest. \u201cBridge-feeding is attendance without appropriation. It is taking a photograph and not showing it to anyone. It is telling small boys to stop carving obscenities in the paint because there are better walls for that, and then writing the obscenity yourself in a place that knows how to forgive.\u201d There was laughter, not cruel, and the river made a noise like the part of applause that is for yourself.\n\nThe officiant liked it, and because it liked it, the fourth question allowed itself to be the kind that leaves a mark without obvious handwriting. \u201cWhich shore do you live on,\u201d it asked both of them without making a joke of metaphor, \u201cand what tax do you pay to go home.\u201d It was always a dirty secret of bridges that they favor one bank; the honest ones admit it, the splendid ones deny it, the useful ones shrug and do their work. Magda looked downriver to where the canal pretended it was river and then to the buildings behind her with their domestic faces and their windows that had learned her name without asking permission.\n\n\u201cWhichever shore has the kitchen I\u2019ve promised to return to,\u201d she said, and she felt the word kitchen do its new work in the air like a saint promoted reluctantly. \u201cIf I am honest, it is not the bank with more lights. It is the one where the ground knows the grammar of my step. The tax is that I must come back the long way sometimes when I have said something too sharp, and the bridge charges me in humility. I pay it because it keeps the wood in my apartment from drying out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI live on the shore with the crowd,\u201d the pilgrim said, and there was no self-loathing in it, only the cool clarity of a person who has learned what she is permitted to love. \u201cI pay by sleeping badly, by losing the names of dogs, by forgetting to bring change, by keeping my hands gentle longer than I would if no one watched.\u201d That last admission hung there between them like a piece of fruit neither wanted to claim and neither would drop, and the bridge, which has little patience for coyness, cleared its iron throat and threw them a reprieve in the form of a procedural.\n\nThe voice of the office, damp and chastened, reminded them that under the arc clause each party could ask one question of the water without it counting against the other\u2019s breath. Magda asked first because generosity is craft as well as courtesy and some crafts require precedence to matter. \u201cWhat have you refused,\u201d she said to the river, remembering an August years ago when it had turned its back on three boys pushing a supermarket trolley out toward the middle. \u201cWhat have you insisted on carrying to the sea even when the city begged you to give it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cNames,\u201d the water said, and the wind folded in respectfully because even air can be taught to behave when grief begins to inflate. \u201cI refuse to keep names that have been shouted at me; I carry them away no matter how much stone holds on. I keep the names breathed instead. Those I keep long enough for the fish to learn and the mud to memorize. I declined a bicycle that believed it was a crown. I returned a crown that wanted to be a bicycle. I have kept three songs because no one had the courage to sing them aloud on land, and a city must have a secret or it turns to glass.\u201d\n\nThe pilgrim asked the water a question that was both clever and true, which is a dangerous combination when the officiant is a structure with a conscience. \u201cHow do you measure audience,\u201d she asked, and the musicians gathered under the western arch who had hoped for a moment did grin at the precision of it. \u201cNot in counts,\u201d she added, as if to reassure Magda that she understood the rules of this place and that her old instruments had learned to tune themselves for nights like this. \u201cBut in weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the sway of birds and the way cigarette smoke hangs or hurries,\u201d the water said. \u201cBy whether children hush each other or no one can tolerate hush. By how long the bread thrown to ducks admits its error and dissolves into humility. By the weight of winter coats on railings and the conversations they remember. By whether the bridge feels heavier when you leave than when you came.\u201d The bridge hummed assent, because it is a joy to be translated into a form the city can comprehend without swallowing, and the inspector made one last flourish with his pen because he was remembering how to distrust the wire without embarrassment.\n\nThe ritual piece\u2014names of productions, numbering of minutes, reminding of penalties\u2014came next because even amended ceremonies must maintain a minimal decency. The clipboard read from her pristine, new-shortened form that neither party had said the other\u2019s name out loud, which meant everyone\u2019s chairs would be safe from mildew so long as no one got clever in an after-dinner speech. The office praised the rope for its cooperation and asked gently that it might be allowed to retire before someone built a story around it. Petra complied with a flourish that made three teenagers decide to learn knots for reasons other than romance, and the rope coiled itself with the kind of elegance that suggests all good tools know when they have been precisely used.\n\n\u201cInstrument,\u201d said the bridge, not so much out of a need to hear a confession as out of the pedagogical desire to see if a lesson had stuck. The audience made a little sound because repetition feels like belonging, and the soup chose that moment to reach a perfect simmer, a domestic amen that made the whole span smell briefly like a decision you are proud of. The pilgrim raised her hand in a motion that looked like surrender and was not. \u201cAudience, as declared,\u201d she said, and the bridge refused to sneer at it because it had seen armies and parades and lovers; it knew that sometimes being watched keeps you from falling. Magda laid her palm on the stone and said \u201cplace\u201d again with the extra gravity that comes when you are repeating something to make it true rather than interesting, and both the stone and the sound conceded the legitimacy of her choice.\n\nThere was one more thing the officiant required, because bridges do not like to be left in the state of anticipation that roads prefer. \u201cAdmit danger,\u201d it said, and horses stamped somewhere not present because they heard their word called. \u201cNot to each other. To the city.\u201d This was the question that divides pageants from rites. The men with thermoses sipped as if coffee could be a moral position, and the children stilled with an attention that had nothing to do with parents\u2019 hands on collars.\n\n\u201cIf we keep doing this wrong,\u201d Magda said, and she felt the hat approve of her posture, \u201cwe will teach the city to clap at the wrong time. We will teach it to prefer cleverness to repair, theatre to stairs. We will break the habit of ordinary chairs being enough. We will invite pretty laws to dine with brutal ones and the polite knives will learn the names of throats. If we do it right, we might build a grammar for rooms that have been waiting centuries to be allowed to speak without being called sentimental. The danger is becoming good at the wrong magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we keep doing this wrong,\u201d the pilgrim said in a voice for once plain as unmagicked bread, \u201cI will become so adept at being watched that I will forget how to stop. The city will forget how to be interesting when no one is filming it. We will build a market for a thing that ought to be a sacrament, and the market will eat it as markets do. The danger is we make a bridge out of knives again and then have the nerve to complain about blood.\u201d She looked at Magda when she said it with a species of warmth that resembled respect and might just have been professional greed, which is a cousin of it.\n\nThe verdict, when it came, did not do the thing verdicts usually do. It did not assign a winner that could be tallied, monetized, sold later in sugar, or tattooed on a forum\u2019s masthead. It took the shape of instructions with teeth, and the teeth were small enough to get between the fibers of everyday life, which is where policy lives if it intends to survive. \u201cContest is complete,\u201d said the bridge, and the north wind run its fingers through pigeon feathers with approval. \u201cPetitioner releases one edge of the compass to place when place insists. Respondent declares publicly that fair and kind are different but compatible and will not be used as each other\u2019s alibis. Both will feed witnesses at future spectacles and not let hunger be an aesthetic. Wires will be treated as guests and made to wait outside with the coats. City will reserve the right to refuse fun if it endangers chairs. Names remain unsaid in public for the length of a winter and the angle of this hat.\u201d\n\nA ripple went through the crowd that felt like gratitude calming a muscle. The inspector wrote \u201ccomplete\u201d in a box that had waited patient months to be filled and then underlined it because men who marry spoons become romantic about outcomes in the correct way. The clipboard woman allowed herself the rare pleasure of closing a file before her breath ended, which in her trade is usually a luxury reserved for deaths and elections. Petra ladled soup with the righteous exhaustion of a priest after a successful holiday, and when someone tried to clap too early she inclined her head at them with such precise disappointment that the clap resolved itself into a better-timed embrace of the air.\n\nThey ate. The pilgrim burned her tongue a little, which she bore with the composure of someone who has learned not to show the city her blister. The operator from the wheel accepted a bowl and stood where he could see both banks, which is the position men who do good work choose without advertisement. A boy fed bread to ducks and then apologized under his breath for the sugar in it, which is a scandal in water circles, and a duck forgave him by biting his bootlace instead of his finger. The river inhaled the warmth and kept its private count. A woman on crutches stayed for the whole thing and did not resent the cold because the bridge had remembered to dip, at the right moment, and make everyone feel tall.\n\n\u201cYou were not fair,\u201d Petra murmured to Magda later, when the span had resumed its ordinary job of letting people cheat at geography. \u201cAnd you were kind enough that children will be allowed to borrow your name when they argue with stairs. She was not kind, but she was fair enough that the city forgave her ring and will stop taking milk from her in caf\u00e9s twice on nine days out of ten. The bridge was itself, which is the real miracle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will write the office and thank them for remembering to be ashamed of wires,\u201d Magda said, and she felt the tide of dread that had been riding in her ribcage since the bread in the shape of a question had arrived recede to a level where you can walk without lifting your knees too high. \u201cAnd then I will go home and unteach the towels what applause sounds like. They got ideas last night and kept their edges out to be admired.\u201d\n\nThe arithmetic pilgrim approached with that clean step she had perfected for camera and court alike, and held out her hand the way you offer someone a lighter in the wind. They did not shake because sometimes that is a superstition and sometimes it is hygiene and sometimes it is mercy; they let their hands talk near each other like diplomats. \u201cNext,\u201d she said, and she said it without sugar and without injury. \u201cNot because of ratings. Because bridges are addictive and I would like to see what a street with a market knows. I will not bring wire. I will bring somebody who has never answered a question into a microphone and see if it improves or ruins them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext,\u201d Magda agreed, and she did not pretend the word lacked gravity. \u201cBecause the city likes to hear itself in different rooms. Because a market has a grammar that has taught more people manners than any school. Because I have a debt to a baker who told my fortune once with crumbs.\u201d They stood there very briefly in a place where compromises were honest, and then the pilgrim turned away with the unkind grace of someone who has taught motion to keep her from growing a conscience, and Magda turned homeward with Petra at her side, which is how courage has survived the winter so far.\n\nThe cat met them three streets from the bridge with a disdainful efficiency that suggested it had been out all afternoon filing reports with the small gods. It had acquired a ticket stub that said in a dead language: for standing where the air is thinner and not pretending to be taller, and it dropped it at Petra\u2019s feet as if to implicate her in elegance. At home, the kitchen performed its trick of smelling like soup even after the spoons had been washed, which is a little-known miracle separate from onions entirely. The towel, well pleased with its new clerical status, had been left a note by the inspector written with the municipal courtesy of a person who prefers to compliment cloth in private: Thank you for officiating in absentia. It had a stamp with two arches and a fishhook and an apology for the starch.\n\nLetters multiplied like a kind of respectable fungus on the mat by morning. One was from the association with a map made in good faith showing where those who wore the fishhook ring liked to stand, and at what hours their questions bit. The pattern was less elegant than prophecy and more practical than menace; it had clusters around courtyards and tram stops, and three dots along the market street Petra had mentioned which suggested the next place would be loud in a human way. Another letter came with the city stamp upside down, which could be read as whimsy or haste; it contained a gentle request that Magda consider making a list of chairs that had suffered under the amended clause\u2019s attention, to be repaired at public expense because people had begun to carry their sorrow into kitchens, and sorrow sits too heavily for cheap wood.\n\nShe made tea because coffee had acquired too many approvals in the last twenty-four hours and deserved a rest. Petra sprawled in the chair the cat had been saving for her and announced that she would steal for the market event three aprons from the theatre museum under a pretense that made art exact its tithe from politics. Magda counted spoons and discovered, with a privately pleased little gasp, that one had learned restraint; if shaken it did not try to answer. She considered the bridge, which had taken their talk and converted it to policy the way stomachs turn soup into blood. She considered the pilgrim, who had discovered late a habit of not cheating and might find it to her taste. She considered the city, which had begun to enjoy being addressed at last in sentences with verbs that did not threaten to take your coat.\n\nAt noon, the boy from the office with the honorable shoulders returned with a brand-new form\u2014Market Clause, addendum to the domestic and elevated provisions\u2014and a wad of blue tape. It said that stalls are officiants if asked in chorus, that haggling counts as precedent but not law, that card tables have no jurisdiction unless they have been blessed by fruit, and that under no circumstances may a chicken be cross-examined without consent. The penalty for premature clapping would be revised to include the sudden proliferation of coriander in unsuitable dishes. The boy read this aloud with straight face and handed over the tape with grave palms, and Petra, not able to help herself, saluted the tape as if it had just been promoted.\n\nThat night, because endings are for festivals and this winter had decided on continuations, Magda sat at the table with the folio of tracings of old D\u2019s and wrote in the margins where her teacher\u2019s neat hand had once refused academies their comfort. She recorded that the bridge had insisted on tolls in soup and mercy instead of coin and swagger, and that the air had behaved. She wrote that the city had enjoyed itself without destroying furniture, and that sometimes this is what religion looks like for people who no longer like altars but still need things that require washing up. She put down that audience can be an instrument if tuned by shame and that place, when given a job, does it honestly and resentful only if you forget to let it nap.\n\nThe cat, apostolic in its certainty that nothing serious happens that does not eventually impinge upon bowls, took up residence on the shelf where the new jars for spirits would sit, as if to bless in advance the future hauntings. Petra fell asleep on the couch with a roll of tape in her fist and the rope coiled by the door as if it had decided to become a pet. The market would make a noise tomorrow and pretend to be a thunderstorm, and someone would ask a question that made a chest of lemons confess to immortality. A bridge had stamped a decision on the day. A kitchen had rewritten one line of law by browning onions with discipline. The wheel, across town, spun once in the late wind and made a sound like a man remembering to apologize to a woman who had been right. And the city, turning under its winter hat, tried out a new habit in the mirror: listening, not for clapping or for footfall, but for the small syllables of places clearing their throats.",

                              "content": "The morning the letter came, mist hung low over the canal and clung to the orange peel of streetlamps along the G\u00fcrtel. Magda Rieder stood barefoot in the tiled kitchen, one hand on the small enamel coffee pot, the other cradling a piece of stale bread, a gift from the bakery below that never closed on a weekday. Steam curled in the windowpane as if it wanted to write something. Her cat, who was not a cat by law or taxonomy but by convenience, watched the kettle with ears lifted, head cocked, thinking about heat in a way that had nothing to do with flames.\n\n\u201cA day of keys,\u201d Magda said to no one. \u201cA day for locks to notice.\u201d\n\nThe coffee bloomed in the pot with a low sound that she always thought was relief. Magda had two clocks in her kitchen: an old brass one that ran five minutes fast and a newer one that was never right for long. Between the two she\u2014more than once\u2014had made appointments happen exactly when she meant them to. Some mornings she turned both to face the wall and waited for the apartment to lose its grip on time. Those were not days for the market or the laundromat or the municipal office with its tickets and numbers gliding up digital red in orderly increments. But this was not one of those mornings. Today the clocks ticked honestly in the manner of things that thought they weren\u2019t being watched.\n\nOutside, a tram groaned, took a corner by flinging its weight around, and clattered away along the rails. A woman on her balcony across the courtyard smoked, her breath a small white ghost. Somewhere a radio squabbled in a language that had too many consonants for before nine a.m., which meant Czech or just German delivered by a man with a mouth full of pastry. Magda opened the window a sliver and slipped a sprig of winter savory onto the sill. Smoke came in, and the courtyard\u2019s cold, damp breath, and from the bakery downstairs the scent of yeast and butter and that burnt sugar bitterness that came from forgetting a tray and then pretending you meant to.\n\nHer phone buzzed with a message from Petra, who had been her friend since they were both apprentices and had mistaken a hymn for a recipe\u2014Magda never tired of that story, though Petra felt differently.\n\nG\u2019mornin, it read. Coffee later? They say she\u2019s on again tonight. Fourth time. Impossible. Except, well, you know how that word likes to slip its shoes off.\n\nMagda looked down at the coffee\u2019s oily surface, where a few bubbles were drifting in toward the center, and let her thumb hover. She could pretend to have slept through the message. That would be a way to be unkind without claiming it. Soft cruelties were a thing she had tried to learn to do without. She wrote: I saw. If it\u2019s the same she. We can watch and be irritated. At eight?\n\nPetra sent back a heart, and a gif of a woman rolling her eyes so theatrically that it should have knocked her off the chair. The cat, whose name changed often enough that it was all cats and no particular one, wound its body around Magda\u2019s ankles and purred and hummed things into the floorboards. The building took it all and gave back a small old warmth.\n\nThere were days when Magda considered going out to the canal, sitting by the water tucked into her coat, and convincing herself she was a civilian. One of those women with a novel open in one hand and a half-eaten apple in the other, the world juicy and really hers. But then the old metal letterbox lid in the hall would cluck, and she would remember the particular smell of stamped envelopes and municipal notices and the cheap ink of flyers for yoga and tax attorneys. That cluck was a kind of shiver in the skin. Today it came early. And saw another half second later, the slow slide of something heavy on old metal.\n\nShe held her coffee like a talisman and went to the door. The hallway air felt different, as if it had been instructed, a minor adjustment in humidity, a whisper of something violets were famous for. The metal lid drooped. In the shadow of the box\u2019s mouth, a rectangle, cream paper, thick as bread. The envelope waited without patience, which is to say it waited because there was no other option. She pulled it free and turned it over, and the outside of it was unmarked except for a stamp that was nothing like a stamp and a small chalk line someone had dragged across the top flap and then smudged with a finger. In the place where a return address should have been there was instead a black wax seal, and pressed into the wax: a question mark in the shape of a hooked fish. Under the curve of the question mark, a small, old, almost florid letter D.\n\nThree things happened in her body at once: her stomach sank but also rose\u2014like an elevator no one had asked for\u2014her skin cooled with a suddenness like stepping into the shadow of a bus, and the place at the base of her skull where the oldest kind of knowing lived blew open. The cat lifted its head and then laid it back down and sighed. They had known this might happen. That is to say: Magda thought she had prepared for it, and the cat had prepared to not be surprised by whatever happened.\n\nShe locked the door behind her on the corridor side, out of long habit, and went back to the kitchen. The kettle saluted her, the water ready to be coerced into tea if not coffee. She set the envelope down on the table where the damp had warped the wood and the wood had taken the message poorly. The black wax had a smell that wasn\u2019t just wax. Something sweet and rank at once, like overripe figs. It clung to the back of her throat. The seal had bled a little onto the paper. She thought of the question mark as a fish and of fish in the Danube and of the Danube swallowing things and spitting them back up on a beach in the wrong country. She thought of a studio\u2019s bright lights and a chair in which a woman had sat last week, ankles crossed neatly, dark hair pinned up with something that had belonged to her grandmother, two of the assistants having bleached their teeth too much.\n\n\u201cBrava,\u201d she said to the envelope. \u201cYou got the smell right.\u201d\n\nAre you going to open it, asked the cat in the language that is not spoken and so needs no grammar. The cat's question was a picture of the envelope\u2019s belly and the possibility of knives.\n\n\u201cI don't have to,\u201d Magda said. \u201cYou saw the seal. It\u2019s as open as anything is before it is opened.\u201d\n\nThe cat made a sound like the smallest iron bell. You will pick the wrong knife if you are too proud about it.\n\nShe brewed another small cup of coffee into a chipped demitasse and spooned a thread of dark honey into it, then set this next to the envelope like an offering left on a stoop in a fable. The steam found the black wax and made it blush; Magda watched a drop form and hover before it rolled, slow and syrupy, toward the wood. She drew a circle with her index finger around the cup and the letter, then another, thinking the words that had taught her not to say them out loud. The first circle was for the place; the second was for the old things that cared about place. In the way a humble circle drawn with breath and intent can be.\n\nAnd then\u2014of course\u2014she opened it. Not with a knife, after all. With her thumb, pressed into the wax\u2019s black and under it a thin layer of something that clung like sleep to eyelashes. The paper tore with the sort of sound that makes ink stand up and pay attention. Inside, a single sheet, thick but not as thick as it pretended to be. The handwriting was done by a person who had made a private study of angles and pressure, and of the way old feuds need a particular slant to how they\u2019re announced.\n\nHonored Magda Rieder, it began. By the right of public oath and by the privilege of contest held in the old municipalities and yet in the new media, I extend you invitation. The letters stood up and dipped in a rhythm that wasn\u2019t European. It pulled from a little bit of everywhere because some people think that makes them universal.\n\nUnder that, the details. The among lines and the officiants and the conditions of refusal, which were none in the old ways and worse in the new. The place was named and then named again to remove the possibility of error: at the Prater\u2019s edge, under the big wheel, cabin seven, at the eighth turn after eight bells on the eighth day from this. There is a way to write eight where it looks like a snake chewing its own tail, and she had done that. And then the name of the sender in an even darker ink as if Part of her wanted it to be tattooed on the reader\u2019s eye. Zita Dorn. The stage name screamed with modesty\u2014because modesty is a rival you never really meant to invite. Under it, in parentheses, smaller and sullen: registered as Dorner, Zita Maria, of Favoriten, formerly of Leoben, citizenship confirmed in 2009, identification issued at- It trailed off as if bored with itself. Someone had written these lower things for the benefit of the ordinary authorities, because there are always ordinary authorities, even here.\n\nThe black question mark seal on the back of the envelope was the question mark she had worn last week at her throat like a cheap charm. It had glimmered on the television light and said nothing and said everything. The quiz show had been called Who Is the Queen When There Are No Kings. Petra had sent three angry texts at different points during the broadcast, full of rhetorical fireworks. Magda had watched too, her lips pressed so tightly together she had tasted salt. The game\u2019s host was a man with a mouth like a smile that someone had pulled across a surface with a finger wet with oil. He had spoken to Zita as if the two of them had known all along that she would win. And she had won. Of course she had. There had been a question about the most obscure species of cave salamander in Eastern Europe. A question about an eighteenth-century land register for a small patch of orchard two hours south of here. A question about a saint who had been invented. Zita had answered with a confidence that would have been arrogance if it had been human. And the lights had turned her hair into a night no one had ever really been in.\n\n\u201cShe cheats,\u201d Petra had said aloud, from the couch where she\u2019d left her coat on as if that would cut her losses. \u201cNot a little. Not elegantly. She picks the whole system up like a rug and shakes it until all the dust is her name.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to cheat,\u201d Magda had said, not because it was true but because some sentences are muscle memory. \u201cShe can\u2019t resist being that way. It isn\u2019t just winning, it\u2019s winning in a way that makes the rules blush.\u201d\n\nPetra had snorted. \u201cSo, that\u2019s good then: we\u2019re dealing with a poet who also does receipts.\u201d\n\nThey had laughed then, or something like it, with the thin knobble of fear at the back of their mouths. And later, when the show had ended with music that wanted to be a parade but had forgotten its costume, Petra had left for the tram with three pretzels tucked into her bag, two for the journey and one for her father who thought he loved salt and in truth salt had been politely tolerating him for years.\n\nBut the laughter was not here now. Zita\u2019s letter lay on the kitchen table like a stone that had been given a pen to hold. The words had weight. Not just symbolic weight, the kind that could be conjured away by wit. The kind that pulled on everything around it like a gravity and a law at once. The cat touched the envelope with one paw, very lightly, as if it was a pond and might ripple.\n\n\u201cBattle?\u201d the cat said, perverse. We still call it battle?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the word she chose.\u201d Magda fingered the shape of the eight on the page and felt it hum. \u201cBattle is old. It makes people think of shields. Better than duel. Duel attracts the wrong kind of attention in this country. Duel makes men who wore swords to dances feel invited.\u201d\n\nYou can decline, the cat offered, knowing that this was more of a thought than a possibility. You can cast your lot into a hat and draw out a different life and insist it\u2019s your own. You can refuse anyone who invites you to bleed for someone else\u2019s ratings.\n\n\u201cShe has linked it to the oath,\u201d Magda said. \u201cYou see that. She framed it. She wants the kind of crowd that comes when someone says there will be an official thing with old papers under it. You know what they\u2019re like. They bring sandwiches and lawn chairs. They bring portable applause.\u201d\n\nThe cat slid onto the chair and stared at her until she looked away. The old oath had been many things. It had been a promise made when the country was the world's expert in mixed messages and empire. It had been reformulated when the country fell apart and then claimed itself again with a smaller table. It had been a way to ensure that disputes would not bleed into the city\u2019s ordinary blood. If you had a quarrel that could not be left to rot on its own, you could bring it under the mechanical protection of a spectacle. So people would think it was about fame or entertainment. And the real thing could hide there, less likely to attract the kinds of curiosity that brought in knives you hadn\u2019t counted on.\n\nIn the next building, someone dropped a pan. The sound made its way through the courtyard like a bird that had forgotten how to navigate. Magda folded the letter and then unfolded it, as if that would change the ink\u2019s set.\n\nAfter breakfast, Magda set about her work. Work is a word that wears a lot of hands. In her case it was translating\u2014people brought her things written in the wrong century, and she persuaded them into the present. It was also consultation for those whose wrong things had turned themselves into consequences. Once she had unwound the plagues from a jar of jam that had been mislabeled by a mother-in-law who meant it to be preserves and not a curse. She went to a courtyard off Lerchenfelder Stra\u00dfe to pour three pails of dark poppy seed along a crack in the stone, because the crack had something to say and could not get a word in otherwise. She visited an old woman downstairs who made schnapps in her bathtub and who had seen in the steamy mirror the face of a boy she had loved in 1944, which had not been as romantic as it sounded. The woman asked Magda to dismiss the boy with kindness. Magda did and then took a small bottle of schnapps anyway, because kindness is not incompatible with collecting your fee in a reasonable form.\n\nBy midday, the sky over the city was a uniform white and the light was returning from everything it touched. She drank soup out of a mug, and the spoon slipped and clanged in a way that suggested a symbol if you were inclined to collect those. Petra sent another message. omg did you see. of course you did. come here if you want to watch me swear before dinner. i have beer. Also a cheese with a rind that frightens me and might have to be negotiated with.\n\nMagda typed: Eight o\u2019clock, your place, I\u2019ll bring bread and olives. Have you got garlic? And then she didn\u2019t send it, because the afternoon had taken a turn and seemed to be listening. That was foolish, to ascribe intent to an afternoon. But foolishness is also a language, and sometimes it makes a kind of sense that logic doesn\u2019t have pockets big enough to carry.\n\nShe opened her laptop and then closed it and then opened it again. She looked up Zita Dorn. It was always a mistake to look too long at the faces of those who would become your enemy; they got into the grooves in your eyes and lived there. But not looking at a problem makes it less like a problem and more like an animal behind a thin, damp curtain. Zita\u2019s official page opened in a crisp white. Photographs in which she wore red. Interviews from two years ago where her voice was soft and pilgrim-bright. A clip in which she was laughing, her hand on the host\u2019s wrist as if to keep him from leaving his job. Rumors in forums, the kind that have users with names like ppatience_1968 and bigwolfvienna. One forum thread began: Did you see how she looked left before the salamander question? Classic sign someone was whispering through the wires. Another: She went to that school, you know. The one with the flag that doesn\u2019t have a country. The one that teaches you to climb on roofs and talk to statues. The one that says publicly we share everything and privately we take.\n\nMagda clicked and clicked and then stopped and rinsed her hands under the tap and felt the water change as it hit her skin, temperature an anecdote told to different fingers with different emphases. She thought about the time in the archive when a voice had spoken as if in a photograph, just a mouth with no face. She thought about the way some people learned to use a crowd as a cloak. She thought about the letter with its black wax seal and the old-fashioned phrase that had no particular allegiance: I extend you invitation.\n\nHow strange to be singled out by someone who preferred rooms with two hundred chairs made from one idea to rooms with a kitchen table she had done her taxes on three years running. How strange to be the person she had this week chosen, as if she had reached into a bowl and pulled a name that had been chewed.\n\nAt four, the bells from a nearby church rang with the frenzy that always made her think of the bells practicing becoming themselves. Magda watched a man on the opposite balcony water a plant with leaves like little silver spoons. He had three rings in his left ear and moved as if gravity was offering him polite suggestions.\n\nShe called Petra. \u201cI recieved something,\u201d she said, and winced at the way the wrong letter in the word made the sentence feel truer. \u201cI received something. Both. From her.\u201d\n\nPetra inhaled in obvious italics. \u201cA cake? A bomb? A bouquet that leans the wrong way?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn invitation. There is a seal. There is the number eight drawn like a serpent and the Prater wheel and cabin seven. She\u2019s invoking the oath. She wants\u2014\u201d She stopped. It was always difficult to tell where wanting ended and insisting began in a person like Zita.\n\n\u201cWe knew she would do this, Mags,\u201d Petra said, voice practical in the way of a person who almost believed in pragmatism. \u201cYou told me last week\u2014when she took the TV money from a question no one should have any business knowing\u2014that she was making a shape. And you were right. She thinks she\u2019s building a new stage, and we all must come in through the trapdoor.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretend to be a fool. Let her underestimate you. Wear a scarf that says you don\u2019t have a plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never worn a scarf that says anything. That\u2019s your trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring the garlic,\u201d Petra said. \u201cAnd a small knife. And a larger one. And the book with the pages that go blank unless you hold it over steam. And Bruno\u2019s left shoe. He swears it\u2019s lucky and I long to be rid of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will do none of those things,\u201d Magda said. And they laughed, though in both their throats a piece of winter took up residence and refused to leave.\n\nAfter they hung up, Magda took the envelope and the letter and the cup with sticky honey on its lip to the sink. She washed the cup with casual care and the envelope with meticulous disinterest. You never knew what lurked in glue. She dried her hands on the towel that had once been a shirt. Then she went to the tall bookcase in the corner of the living room, where the bottom two shelves were as haunted as cupboards could be without frightening the resident children. She pulled down a book about the old laws of the city, the ones etched in granite and in floorboards and in people\u2019s mouths. The page for the oath of contests crackled when she opened it, as if someone\u2019s hands had been there not long ago. There were notes in the margin written in a neat unsentimental script, her teacher\u2019s hand, she would know it anywhere. A sentence bloomed in the margin like mold: If you must go, bring a person who loves you and wants you to win, not a person who loves winning and wants you to be their instrument.\n\nMagda closed the book gently and looked at the cat. \u201cYou don\u2019t love me.\u201d\n\nThe cat blinked. I am not made of love or hate. I am made of the little pieces of noise at the edges of both. But I want you to live, because living is interesting, and because you have learned how to heat milk without scalding it. Also you arrange cushions in a way that benefits me.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Magda said. \u201cYou are, as always, balm.\u201d\n\nShe set the book back and took down another, a thinner one stitched in blue thread. The list inside was her list, kept too long and with too much care. How to prepare for a public duel in a private city. Things to bring. Things to leave behind. She had written it when she was twenty and had thought she knew where the edges were. She read the items as if they belonged to another person and decided that the other person had not been entirely a fool.\n\nWhen evening came, she took bread and olives in a paper bag and walked to Petra\u2019s, because the tram was late and she had energy to spend. The sidewalks had that gloss that happens when the day freezes back into itself. People were wrapped in their coats and in their voices, talking about the football match, about their mother\u2019s elbow, about the number of tourists at the cathedral this afternoon. Three children chased a half-deflated ball, which made a sound like a curse every time someone\u2019s foot nicked it just so. At the corner, a man with a portable radio held it up so that everyone passing would hear the news and perhaps buy one of the wallets he had laid out on a blanket that had seen\u2014better days, worse days.\n\nPetra lived on the third floor of a building with a lift that had opinions about mass. Her hair was pulled up with a pencil. She opened the door as if she had been waiting for an hour, and likely she had, likely she had been pretending to rearrange a shelf while listening with her whole skin for footsteps. They embraced in the doorway without the ceremony of hello.\n\n\u201cI brought brine,\u201d Magda said. \u201cAnd three kinds of foolishness. They may be indistinguishable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have beer,\u201d Petra said, leading her into the kitchen where a slim TV perched on a stool as if it were a pet that had chosen that spot. \u201cAnd a cheese with a rind that looks like something the forest did after thinking about it too much.\u201d\n\nThey arranged the food as if a little ritual had been promised and would be delivered. They didn\u2019t talk about the letter right away. They were both old enough to allow joy to go first into the room whenever it broke in late.\n\nThe program started with a jingle, silly and knowing. The host came out in a blue suit the shade of tile in pools that are heated a little too much. He grinned the way some buildings lean. The audience clapped as if somebody had pressed a button, which someone had. The first contestant looked like a person who knew how to calibrate instruments on an airplane and was at peace with that. The second was an old woman whose smile could have sold knives. The third was Zita.\n\nShe wore black, the simplest kind, the kind that swallowed the definition around it. Her hands were ringless except for one thin band of metal on her left thumb. On the thumb\u2019s band: engraved, the tiny fish-shaped question mark. Her hair was pinned back with tiny red lacquered clips that would have looked like clownfish if anyone had been close enough to say so. Her mouth was not a wound or a promise; it was something else, and Magda had learned a long time ago that not every mouth had a metaphor that could be fetched like a dog.\n\nThe game unspooled with the precision of something that had been drilled until it had become muscle. Zita answered in a voice that had been taught to be both modest and inexorable. She did a demure smile after a particularly implausible question\u2014the kind of smile that said even the air was on her side. Petra swore in long strings under her breath, as she had promised, in a dialect that belonged to a village that had only ever existed when her father sang.\n\nThey watched until the beer was warm and the bread was gone and the olives were only pits and brine. \u201cShe\u2019s moving the line,\u201d Petra said when the credits at last climbed the screen. \u201cThere\u2019s what\u2019s allowed, and there\u2019s what you can get away with, and there\u2019s what becomes the new allowed because no one grabbed your wrist when they should have.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s also having the time of her life,\u201d Magda said. Sometimes that mattered. Mostly it made people cruel. Power is bored by those who aren\u2019t having fun. That was a rule she had found written on a wall once, and she had remembered it because it had been written in handwriting that looked like laughter attempting arithmetic.\n\n\u201cI hate the way she looks into the lens as if choosing someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was,\u201d said Magda, and the kitchen fell out of its chair for a second. \u201cShe chose me this morning.\u201d\n\nPetra put her elbows on the table and used her big hands to hold her face up so that feeling could have somewhere to happen. \u201cWe will write a letter back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will make it formal. We will use phrases that make anyone reading cough and say the word custom with hatred. We will remind her that just because a thing is a spectacle doesn\u2019t a make it a carnival. We will-\u201d She ran out of will.\n\n\u201cWe will go to the Prater,\u201d Magda said softly. \u201cOn the eighth day. Because she has used the oath and the wires.\u201d\n\nPetra looked down at the table. There were small rings of oil where the olives had been. The rings had arranged themselves into a symbol Magda recognized and decided to forget immediately. \u201cYou do not have to do this alone,\u201d Petra said.\n\n\u201cThe law says bring no one. You know it. The public is the witness. The cabin itself is the officiant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will not go. You will invoke some exception written in that book with confusing marginalia.\u201d\n\nMagda shook her head. \u201cIf I decline, she will make meals out of that. She will cook me with the idea of me. She will say: The people who owe you keenness are not keen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we send someone else. Someone who has no skin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are short on friendless ghosts this week. I checked the rota.\u201d She smiled and then didn\u2019t.\n\nPetra reached across the table and took Magda\u2019s hand. The kitchen performed its trick of being the whole world. \u201cListen to me,\u201d she said, voice a riverbed. \u201cWin or lose, hon-\u201d She stopped herself. Names acquire talons when you load them with hope. \u201cWe know what she is. We know what you are. You are not a fair person, Magda. I mean that as praise. You are not too fair to survive out there. But you are the kind of honest that has teeth. She will not have counted on that.\u201d\n\nMagda squeezed Petra\u2019s fingers. The knuckles had a map printed on them, of every year\u2019s winter. \u201cI will write her back,\u201d she said. \u201cI will accept.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will eat a slice of cheese for courage, even though the rind is telling me it has seen things, and those things were late and worrying.\u201d\n\nMagda laughed, and then a kind of fog lifted. She did eat the cheese. It tasted like the inside of a bell. She tasted iron and memory and the way cows in summer stand under trees and consider what shade is. The beer had gone flat and warm, but she drank it anyway because rituals like to be completed even in small ways.\n\nShe walked home under a sky that had decided to be starred. It was not a showy decision. The stars were more like a rumor, pinholes in the cloud where someone had pressed hard with a needle. At the Prater the giant wheel was a half-moon of lights in the distance, a necklace someone had taken off and hung on a nail. Cabin seven. Eighth turn. Eight bells. She tried not to do math with it. She tried not to make it into a nursery rhyme. She tried not to be thirteen again, telling herself that if she turned twice and then didn\u2019t look down when crossing the bridge she would keep her mother living one more year. She tried not to remember the smell of the hospital, that lemon disinfectant and between it something that no one talks about.\n\nBack in her kitchen, she took paper and a pen that had belonged to a man she had gone to bed with three times and then never called again because sometimes kindness is knowing when you should be selfish. She wrote:\n\nTo Zita Dorner, of whomever and what place.\n\nI received your letter. I accept your conditions, because they are mine too, because we live here, because the bell rings the whole city whether you thought to or not. The Prater. Cabin seven. The eighth turn after eight bells. The witnesses will come and all their eyes will be mouths.\n\nI will come with what I am. No more, no less. I trust you will too, despite your habit of collecting extra pockets.\n\nA small drawing bloomed at the bottom of the page without her having decided to. It was a fishhook bent into a question mark, and under it she drew a straight pin. They were two letters, if letters could be forged.\n\nShe sealed the letter with candle wax because she had run out of the black kind years ago and because using red would be a waste. She resisted the urge to put anything else in there with it. A pinch of salt. A clipping. A hair. Resisted and then changed her mind and slid in three mustard seeds because sometimes love is making sure you can recognize your own letter if someone decides to toss it into a pile.\n\nAt the door she hesitated. The mailbox? The post? The small boy with the large ears who was always sitting on the steps trying to sell someone a tiny painted soldier from his grandfather\u2019s cupboard? In the end she set it in the general outbox to the underworld, which is to say she slid it into the crack between the lift and the world and listened until a roll and a sigh told her it had gone to the place where such letters go.\n\nShe slept badly. Dreams came that pretended to be useful but were really advertisements. In one, she was in the quiz show chair, and questions rose around her like bubbles, and instead of answering she reached out and popped them one by one. In another, she and Petra were children, throwing rocks at a wheel because it wouldn\u2019t stop turning. In the last, the letter became a bird and pecked her ear until she bled black wax.\n\nIn the pale morning she woke to the sound of a bicycle bell. The cat had discovered a way to look offended and innocent at once. There was flour on the table from nowhere, and on the flour a thin line as if a finger had written a word and then erased it. She made coffee with hands that were steadier than they felt.\n\nEight days. That was long enough to teach a muscle a new trick. That was not long enough to become a new animal. She would practice how to stand in a cabin that moved and made motion a rule. She would practice how to answer questions with her eyes. She would practice how to hand back a cheat. She would practice; then she would improvise; then she would choose when to be selfish.\n\nOn the second day a small box came to her from a woman she did not know, the kind of stranger whose mouth makes strangers into neighbors before they have earned it. Inside the box, a deck of cards with no faces. You drew a card and the blanched surface said something you had meant to say yourself. On the third day, the woman downstairs asked for her schnapps back because she had a date with someone as old as she, and nerves required fortification. On the fourth day, a child on the street ran past Magda with arms extended and whispered, as if reciting, \u201cCabin seven.\u201d Children pick up things with their ears and then carry them across town because they have pockets that don\u2019t stay empty. On the fifth day, the quiz show did a special episode where no one won and the audience was asked to stand and applaud randomness. On the sixth day, a crow landed on Magda\u2019s windowsill with a bottlecap in its beak, and she took it and set down a piece of the cheese rind, and the exchange was good and made them both think better of the world. On the seventh day, it snowed.\n\nSnow in Vienna is a complicated moment. It is both romance and complaint. It is both an opera and a line at the bakery. Magda watched it fall as if the city had decided to be dandruff. The cat pawed at the flakes where the window was warm and the cold made them elaborate. Magda took out her old coat, the one with the pockets she had once hidden a field in. She whispered to it, and it whispered back with the sound of moths changing their minds.\n\nOn the eighth day, Petra came at seven in the evening. They had made no plan to meet. They had always made the same plan without making it. When a person you love is going to be deliberate with danger, you hold their coat while they put their arms in. Petra braided Magda\u2019s hair as if it was a rope they would both climb. She put something into the braid that glittered with a specific temperance. It didn\u2019t matter what it was. It mattered that Petra\u2019s hands had done it.\n\n\u201cWe are going to a fair,\u201d Petra said, voice so wry you could have sharpened a knife on it.\n\n\u201cWe are,\u201d Magda said. \u201cA very old fair where once men bought prizes made of glass and pretended they were immortal.\u201d\n\nThey walked. The cold held them in both its hands and squeezed gently, as if trying to figure out how they fit. The paths into the Prater were dark in the way that cities make, light pooled in the wrong places, shadows doing creative work between. The wheel rose ahead. Cabin seven was not magic; it was a wooden box with windows and hinges that had known every kind of weather. There were people there already, of course. People who had brought their winter hats with pompoms and their phones and their whispered verdicts. Spectacle, always, had babysitters and bystanders, and they did their jobs with varying degrees of professionalism.\n\nA woman with a clipboard and a lanyard, the natural predator of the Vienna bureaucrat, approached. \u201cNames,\u201d she said aloud. She looked at Petra, at Magda, at the cat now nowhere, because the cat had other plans that did not involve being counted.\n\n\u201cMagda Rieder,\u201d Magda said, and the woman\u2019s pen skipped briefly as if it had learned the name in another life and had to exert itself to write it properly.\n\n\u201cContestant,\u201d the woman said, checking a box. First word: small, second word: big. Then her eyes moved right and left, eyes that had mastered the universal code of either I'm bored or I am extremely alert and would prefer you not know it. \u201cYou know the rules,\u201d she added, without kindness and without threat. It was the tone of a tram driver at midnight who has seen two hundred variations of the same problem and expects nothing except someone to stand too near the door.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Magda said. \u201cI know all the rules, even the ones you won\u2019t say out loud because they partly belong to the ground we are standing on.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded as if that was a correct answer. She pointed to cabin number seven with a pen that had the show\u2019s name printed on it. Someone had covered the name with tape. It was supposed to be anonymous; that was the fiction, anyway. Zita stood a little apart, wearing a coat that looked like an argument made into fabric. Her face was turned up to the wheel as if she were saying grace. When she saw Magda, she smiled with just her teeth. The smile made it clear she\u2019d eaten something no one had offered her.\n\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d Zita said to the air. \u201cWe are all here. The list can relax; the night can begin.\u201d Her eyes flicked to Petra and then away, as if to say: I have chosen our positions; you will stand where I put you in my thinking. Petra folded her big arms and made the statue of an angel that guards bridges.\n\nPeople moved as they were told to move by signs and by the choreography of crowds who have seen other crowds and learned those dances. The bell in the clock near the carousel began to ring. Eight, with the kind of measured certainty that was a prompt and a prayer. The wheel creaked as the operator, who had seen more nights than rules, set it in motion. Cabin seven opened its mouth.\n\nIt was warmer inside than Magda expected. There was a winter\u2019s worth of breath caught in the wood. The windows were clean in the careless city way\u2014someone had considered washing them and then been interrupted by an old man telling the story of a thing he had seen here when he was a boy, which had not been a true thing but had been told and told until it had the privileges of truth.\n\nZita stood across from her, the cabin closing them into a slice of the sky. There were no chairs. There was no host with a grin. There were two microphones installed late and a camera eye set into the corner like a fly too well-fed to buzz. The city fell away beneath them in a slow, inevitable drop. The wheel took its first turn.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d Zita said softly, to Magda, and to the camera, and to the bell as it finished singing and took a breath. \u201cFinally.\u201d\n\nMagda said: \u201cI would have preferred to meet in a kitchen.\u201d She let the words be plain. She let them go without their armor. \u201cBut of course kitchens are not where you gather power these days, are they.\u201d\n\nZita laughed and turned her head slightly so that a lock of hair fell like a poet\u2019s first metaphor. \u201cOh, kitchens still matter,\u201d she said. \u201cMen fear them because they cannot control them. That hasn\u2019t changed. But yes. I prefer the circles that people draw by accident when they sit with their mouths open. I like to be in there when the mouth makes shapes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cheat,\u201d Magda said.\n\nZita\u2019s lips parted in a small oh that was neither surprise nor offense. \u201cCheat is a word made by people who were late to breakfast and want to own lunch. I take the thing you take and I carry it better because I don\u2019t apologize while I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the show,\u201d Magda said. \u201cNames matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen say mine with the old pronunciation,\u201d Zita said. She leaned closer as the cabin rocked and righted. \u201cSay it like you know where the letter belongs in your throat. Say it like you met a woman on a road and took her hand and told her it wasn\u2019t her fault she loved winning. Say Zita Dorner, of no one and everywhere. Say it and then show me your pockets, Magda Rieder. The audience adores pocket checks.\u201d\n\nThe wheel rose, and the city beneath them widened. The Danube lay like a promise in the distance, and the buildings were a chessboard that had mislaid four pieces and pretended not to notice. A small boy waved at the cabin from below, a red hat in a moving crowd.\n\nMagda took a breath and let it out. She spoke then in the old way, the way that promised both spectacle and law, words that had been smoothed by tongues long dead. Her mouth was dry. Her knees were steady. Zita listened with her head tilted as if an unfamiliar bird had settled on the windowsill and begun to speak politics.\n\nWhen the first question came, it came from the speaker in the ceiling, the voice that had held the show together for weeks. It asked something about a crown and a year and a piece of parchment that had considered itself the boss of people who did not consent to be bossed. Zita\u2019s eyes flicked left in that little way that meant someone elsewhere had not been disciplined in their desire to help. Magda watched the flick and felt a movement in her own skull, something like a coin slid under a shell in a game that had never once been fair, and she did not reach to move it. She waited, and then she spoke, and the word she said was the wrong answer on purpose, because sometimes you win by moving the circle a little bit away and making the other person step where there is no floor.\n\nThe cabin lifted. The city did not care that it held them. The camera eye watched and did not blink. The wheel went around once as if testing both of them, and then went around again, and Magda realized that the night had teeth, and she was in its mouth, and the only way out was either through the tongue\u2019s kindness or by becoming something even a mouth could not quite manage to hold. She smiled without showing her teeth, which is to say she looked like herself entirely. And downstairs, in the cold, Petra looked up and folded her arms and sent a thought that did not need a grammar to be understood: Do not let her rearrange the furniture inside you. Keep the table where we put it. Keep the knives where they hang. Keep the salt in a pinchable place.\n\nThe wheel took its eighth bell as if bells could be counted by mechanical grace and by blood at once. The city shifted its consciousness in small ways; people who had not planned to turn their heads turned them. Though the cabin was a room and the room was ordinary, though the air was thin and smelled of paint and old cedar and winter, though laws were being invoked and eyes were being fed, there was a moment when Magda could have sworn the sky itself leaned in to see. That might have been a trick of the wheel. It might have been Zita\u2019s doing. It might have been exactly what it felt like: the world noticing, briefly, that someone had come to battle with both hands open and their pockets empty but full of other things entirely.",

                              "content": "The first answer laid itself down like a playing card that meant nothing by itself and everything in sequence. A small light by the camera changed color, the kind of meek red that means both recording and apology. Somewhere under their feet a relay accepted the error and carried it away on its little back. Zita\u2019s mouth made a shape it had rehearsed for wrongness\u2014sweet surprise, and a microsecond of pity\u2014then let it fall. Magda kept her gaze fixed on the seam where the window met the wood. A smudge there had the exact shape of a fingerprint, or of a country that had been erased from a schoolbook and kept lingering on children\u2019s tongues anyway. The voice in the ceiling cleared its throat with the expensive sound of something that had been told not to cough and did so with gravitas instead. The wheel groaned; the people below became smaller and better behaved; and the cabin crossed a corner of the sky where clouds had left a thumbprint too.\n\n\u201cSecond,\u201d said the voice, and this time it carried the crisp new-paper smell of a question that wanted to be respected by people who had learned to frown over their coffee. \u201cWhen the rights of contest are invoked under municipal ordinance 18, subsection c, what advantage is afforded the petitioner in the matter of scope?\u201d The language had the smugness of a clerk who has never once spilled ink. Zita\u2019s eyes did the little flick that had enraged the forums. It was so tiny that it could have been a blink taught better manners. Magda exhaled slowly until the window fogged, then lifted her hand and wrote a letter there that was not a letter, the arc of a circle begun and not completed, a sentence friendlier than punctuation. In the fog, the question was visible the way breath sometimes makes visible the thing the air had been trying to say without lips. \u201cScope is a kind of famine,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you say scope, you mean the right to choose the field and the instruments, and the petitioner is granted the choosing so long as they declare the extent in public. The advantage is theater. The advantage is called a crowd.\u201d She did not say c. She did not say ordinance. She said the words that belonged to the floorboards.\n\n\u201cIt is more technical than that,\u201d Zita murmured, eyes still soft, voice for the camera\u2019s sake a little breathless as if the altitude had been wheedling her. \u201cIt is measured. We measure it. We make it measurable. That\u2019s what it means to live like this instead of in the weather.\u201d The light shifted behind her and turned the coast of her cheek into something a painter would later misremember as devotion. \u201cScope means my hand gets the compass and yours gets the pencil.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you set the radius,\u201d Magda said, because letting someone else name the length of a circle is the fastest way to be walked in. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the floor knows where the nails are.\u201d She tapped the wood with the toe of her boot. Once, twice, and then once again in time with the sound the city makes when a tram\u2019s wheels hit a defect in the rail and decide to make poetry out of it. The voice accepted her answer because it had to\u2014the old languages, when spoken with the right temper, obliged the new mechanisms to dress themselves in different clothes. Outside, the wheel found the top of itself and did what tops do: noticed the falling.\n\nThird came dressed in the innocent clothes of biography, the kind you buy in a stationer\u2019s shop where the owner keeps an old dog under the till. \u201cGive the derivation of your name,\u201d the voice said, with a friendliness that had been calculated, and somewhere below several people turned to each other and did the thing crowds do when invited to feel the intimacy of someone else\u2019s history. Zita looked delighted. She had told this story already on late-night radio, had told it with a little choke of throat, had named a grandmother\u2019s kitchen, had described a child, herself, insisting that she would not be a Maria because Maria was a wall in a church and she wanted to be a doorway. Magda could feel Petra\u2019s disapproval like a warmed coin in a pocket; naming is old magic, and hearing someone do it prettily for strangers is like watching a child sell her hair to a man who promises a wig. \u201cI was Magda for a woman who had no children and a lot of violets,\u201d she said before Zita could speak. \u201cRieder because somebody liked the way the sound leaned. The papers will tell you another thing and they won\u2019t be wrong, but papers never bent down to pick up a dropped spoon, so I don\u2019t take their word as the only word. The derivation is this: a woman in a market put a hand on my head when I was an infant and said, That one is stubborn, and stubborn walks like Magda. And my mother, who had damaged a dictionary once and never trusted reference after that, said, Yes.\u201d She let the story sit there, not because it was a shield but because it had weight and weight is often a better defense than sharpness. Zita\u2019s lips tightened in a way that was elegant if you did not know what it meant to want to be the only person who knows how to turn a key.\n\nThe wheel passed a strut white with frost. The cabin, as if in sympathy, gave a small semitone of complaint that might have been wood asking for oil or might have been old rules asking for courtesy. Between the spokes, the city flipped its pages, each square of light in an apartment a chapter in a bad or excellent novel. Magda pressed her fingers together and felt the small buzz she had trained herself to notice when wires brought whispers. It came from the corner behind Zita, thin as the idea of sugar in coffee ordered black. She looked not at Zita but at the little metal plate by the ceiling where the microphone had been bolted after some meeting where a man said words like deliverable and activation. There is a clause, she remembered, that says the air must be unowned during a contest. It is not called that exactly in the book, because the old book lets you pretend that the air belongs to no one without stating plainly that anyone who tries to own it must be slapped in public. \u201cBreathe with me,\u201d she said suddenly, not to the woman across from her but to the glass. She drew a circle again with her breath and finished it this time. Below, Petra must have felt the draft of the thought because she took in a breath so large that three people near her turned to see if she had been startled by a ghost. A moment later one of the attendants reached up on the outside of the cabin and slid a latch, old-fashioned and unapologetic. A window opened the width of a palm. Air came in that had been out of doors long enough to forget the rules. Zita frowned. Her shoulder twitched. The flick to the left looked less like a twitch and more like an unpracticed shrug. The whisper line suffered, which is to say it met weather and did not like it.\n\nThe next question wanted to sound ancient, but it had a stain where you could see the modernity had bled through. \u201cName,\u201d the voice said, and the microphone seemed to enjoy the sound of the single syllable so much that it stretched it out like dough. \u201cName the patron saint of false witnesses unmasked.\u201d A murmur went up from below from those who had watched the episode where a saint had been invented and then paraded past people who needed to believe in something convenient. Zita\u2019s smile snapped into place with the tidy cruelty of a clasp. \u201cLudmila of the Latch,\u201d she said, because she had given the saint that nickname herself and had dressed a statue in a film of approval and sugared curiosity. \u201cShe\u2019s not real,\u201d she added, smiling to the camera as if she were being generous. \u201cBut neither is the difference between truth and proof when the room is watched closely enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no saint,\u201d Magda said, \u201cbut there is a street where someone has painted a door that opens only when the weather wants you to go through.\u201d She had seen it last year, off Neustiftgasse, where the houses lean in to listen to men in hats talking about football and sorrow. \u201cIf you stand there and ask to be allowed, an old woman will tell you if you deserve it. If you lie, she will laugh until the lie falls out of your ear and lands on the pavement to be stepped on by a passing tourist. That\u2019s who you are talking about and you know it. Don\u2019t pour sugar on it and call it holy.\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant to be unkind, but sometimes a sentence comes wearing boots. Zita\u2019s eyes cooled. \u201cIncorrect,\u201d said the voice from the ceiling, not because it was wrong\u2014streets require faith\u2014but because the apparatus had no way to register a thing that was not carved on paper at City Hall. \u201cAccepted,\u201d said the wheel beneath them, because the wood remembered more than the ordinance.\n\nTurn two fell away and turned to three. The cabin did its little forward-hinged bow to gravity each time it crossed the top. Magda thought of the mustard seeds she had slid into her envelope and wondered if they had found their way into a pocket near here and if they were doing what seeds do best: being patient and waiting to be asked. Zita shifted her weight and the coat she wore made a very soft sound, like silk being reminded of a past life. \u201cDo you know,\u201d Zita said conversationally, as if they were two women in a queue and not two people teaching a wheel a lesson, \u201cthe first time I lied on purpose? I mean in the way you object to, where the lie is a tool, not a color? I told a teacher that I had hurt my hand so I couldn\u2019t write, and she let me speak. I liked speaking. I liked it so much I learned to hurt what was in the way of it.\u201d She said it as if it were gospel. The camera drank her face. The people below, who had not come for a confession but would settle for anything fed to them with confidence, leaned closer without moving. \u201cThat is not a question,\u201d Magda said. \u201cIt is the right shape to be a question if you shaved two pieces off and tilted it a little to the left, but it is not one. Are you allowed to ask me to admire you in the middle of the law?\u201d She put a small smile on the side of her mouth where jealousy sometimes sits; she offered that smile to the wood of the cabin rather than to the woman.\n\nThe voice went on, dutiful as a man with a tray of drinks. \u201cUnder the older formulations, contestants may each proffer a question once, under seal.\u201d The word seal made both of them look, involuntarily, at the place in the letter where the black wax had pretended to be old. Magda felt a prickle along her forearms, as if a choir of bureaucrats had cleared their throats in unison. She had been saving her one. In her pocket someone else\u2019s pen was warm. She could feel Petra\u2019s hands in her hair pulling through the braid and tucking in the small glittering thing that did not matter and also mattered a great deal; the glitter was a piece of broken glass taken from the floor of a hotel where a different contest had gone wrong; it was a reminder and a compass both. \u201cI proffer,\u201d she said, and the wheel hummed a little differently because a proffer is an old word and pleased a mechanism that had once been maintained by men with cigarette ash under their nails. \u201cMy question is for the officiant.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot\u2014\u201d said Zita, which was a way of saying she did not like to be asked to share authority with an object. \u201cI can,\u201d Magda said gently, \u201cbecause the officiant is a thing that notices. We agreed to that when we chose this place. The giant wheel belongs to the city because everyone owes it a small piece of their childhood and their fear of height. That\u2019s the legal phrasing under the paint.\u201d She put her hand flat against the wood. It was warmer than she expected, as if a thousand winter hands had left kindness there. \u201cOfficiant, ask.\u201d She made of the word not an order but an invitation like the ones she had been taught to write on the breath so that old stones would feel included.\n\nIt took a second. Machines, even old ones, have pride and do not like to be hurried into intimacy. The voice from the ceiling tried to speak and then did not. The camera tried to tilt and then did not. A small change came through the floor, as if the axle had shifted its thought from rotation to attention. The question rose through the wood like sap. \u201cWhat do you owe me,\u201d asked the wheel, and its voice was not a voice but a sound she recognized from summers when the metal had been hot enough to smell. \u201cWhat do you owe to the thing that holds you up while pretending to let you fly? Say what you owe honestly.\u201d It was not poetry; it was not legal; it was the kind of question that refuses to be arraigned by cleverness. Zita\u2019s mouth opened and then closed. Magda could feel heat behind her own eyes and in the angle of her jaw. She thought about the day her father had lifted her into a cabin and she had decided to be brave because he hated that she was frightened and she loved him in the complicated way children love people who want them to be different. She thought of climbing higher than she could justify in a courtyard once, up iron that rusted on her palms, and how the view from the clothesline had made her both generous and petty at once.\n\n\u201cI owe you my balance,\u201d she said to the wheel in a voice that felt like the first swallow of a winter drink made of spices and apology. \u201cI owe you the grit under my boot. I owe you not to throw anything over the side and call that letting go. I owe you to know the difference between floating and being carried. I owe you thanks for the moment when you go slow at the top to make a child feel like God.\u201d She had not expected the last sentence, and when it arrived it undid something tight just below her ribs. Zita looked at her with a complicated expression that could have been contempt and might have been recognition, which is worse.\n\nZita\u2019s answer came with the steadiness of someone who understood performance and had trained herself to hate confessed need as a road to hunger she could not control. \u201cI owe you money,\u201d she said first, and several people below laughed in the relieved way crowds do when a line is thrown like a bone. \u201cI owe you my best angle. I owe you to behave in your cabin so you keep letting me in. I owe you nothing else.\u201d It would have been an answer in a more ordinary place. The wheel considered. It had long since learned not to expect gratitude, but it liked to be addressed as a thing with a job. The wood thrummed underfoot. The cabinet with the camera in it twitched, embarrassed to be seen judging. Magda felt the relief that comes when a place has taken your answer and not spit it back in your face as if you had spoken nonsense to a tree.\n\nThe voice upstairs, startled into mortal duty, returned. \u201cFourth,\u201d it said, but it sounded scuffed. \u201cThere is a clause concerning measures of silence. Recite it.\u201d Zita spoke quickly to get back on the part of the map where she knew where to put her feet. \u201cSilence must be equal when it happens; time without speech is counted and carried over. You cannot starve someone with quiet. That\u2019s written.\u201d Her thumb rubbed the ring it wore, and the fishhook question mark flashed in the cabin\u2019s electric light. Magda thought of the three mustard seeds again. She could smell faintly, under the cedar, a bitterness. It might have been her imagination; it might have been the way winter makes sometimes of people: small gardens growing in the wrong places.\n\n\u201cWe owe each other to leave some of it unsaid,\u201d Magda added, because clauses are improved by mercy when they are remembered out loud. \u201cWe owe each other to leave room for what can\u2019t be said to sit down without being asked to dance. That is the part the book leaves out, but the city knows it. If you press your ear to the statue by the Rathaus long enough, the stone will say the same, and the police will shrug and pretend not to notice you being peculiar because you are not hurting anyone.\u201d The voice did not accept or deny. It had begun to understand that arguing with the ground was bad for its warranty.\n\nThe fifth came flavored like arithmetic, which was Zita\u2019s field, even if the numbers she liked best were ratings and not sums. \u201cEight is not only a number,\u201d Magda said before the question could finish posing itself as an ordinary invitation to count. \u201cEight is the way two circles decide they will not be lonely.\u201d Zita made a noise as if to swat away a fly. \u201cEight is the law\u2019s vanity,\u201d she said, and the camera adored her again because contempt always photographs like glamour. \u201cIt is the way you draw infinity when you are too tired to stand upright. It\u2019s not magic; it\u2019s an agreement. We agreed to this one. We could agree to a nine and call it better because it looks like a person who has stopped pretending to be a serpent.\u201d She had a point. She often had points. It had made her able to cut through cloth she had not woven.\n\nBelow, the man who ran the wheel scratched his ear with a key, and Petra leaned in and said something to the clipboard woman in the careful tone of someone asking politely for a door to be opened that must be opened twice. The clipboard woman listened with all the disdain good clerks carry like an umbrella, and then moved toward a panel and pressed her thumb there for exactly as long as it takes the human body to remember a time when food was not guaranteed. The cabin jolted. Wind that had been working hard all afternoon was admitted in a gust that ignored show business. Zita\u2019s hair loosened by a piece. She did not reach to fix it, which Magda admired because pettiness is catching and she was trying not to be infected tonight.\n\n\u201cSixth,\u201d the voice said, running now, because someone somewhere had told it the world preferred momentum. It asked the sort of thing you kept in the pocket of an exam: list three protections afforded to the ordinary citizens in the case of spectacle, and to whom they are to petition for relief. Zita looked so bored for a moment that Magda could see the girl she had been before the world learned to clap for her. \u201cEarplugs,\u201d Zita said. \u201cSafe exits. The right not to be filmed if they raise three fingers and keep them up. Petition goes to the officer in the bright jacket who pretends not to be a priest, or to the operator who pretends not to be God, or to the woman with the clipboard who is God\u2019s intern.\u201d It was a good answer because it was not wrong; it was wrong because it kindled nothing gentle in the room; and the wood did not bother noting the difference because it had seen much worse and did not have the bandwidth for didactics.\n\nMagda added the thing the books had footnoted only in the older editions, the ones printed when ink smelled funny and pages stuck together in damp weather. \u201cThey can also petition the crowd,\u201d she said, and felt the murmur below change as people remembered that safety sometimes is only that: looking sideways and deciding to be the voice that says no when no is needed. \u201cThree people shouting is a petition. Ten is a rule.\u201d She glanced at Petra without moving her head. Petra stood with her feet apart and her big arms folded and her face a geography of stubbornness and love. The woman with the clipboard, to her credit, did not roll her eyes. She had been doing this too long to refute common sense.\n\nThere was time moving around them that did not stay in place like normal time. It was the time of waiting rooms and of lovers holding their breath and of the space between a lit match and the first lick of flame. When the seventh came, it came like a coin you drop on purpose because you want to hear if it clinks the right way. \u201cQuestion,\u201d said Zita then, stepping in where the voice had been about to. It was her proffer. Her eyes were bright with a hunger that had belonged to her since she was small and had been told to eat less of herself. \u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d she asked in a tone scraped free of the sugar she used for television. \u201cNot the job. Not the little jobs. The big one. The one people come into back rooms to talk to you about. The one with the saints and the stairs and the why-don\u2019t-you just join us and stop pretending to be a civilian. Why did you stop doing the work the way we do it?\u201d\n\nThere was a sound then that had nothing to do with the wheel. It was the small dry noise of a thing inside your chest that has been looked at without being warned. Magda opened her mouth and closed it and opened it again, a hinge that had not been oiled recently. She thought of her teacher\u2019s hand in the margin with its neat notes and its sentence about the person who loves you and wants you to win. She thought of a year when she had gotten too good at the trick where you leave a room with everyone believing they had won. She thought of a night on a roof when she had said yes to something and then had woken in the morning with the word no under her tongue like a pill you are supposed to swallow without water. \u201cBecause fair and kind are not the same,\u201d she said finally. \u201cBecause I am not fair and I am particular about that. Because the room where you do it is hungry in a way that makes me cruel. Because appetite makes me stupid and I liked being less stupid. Because my mother died and I discovered that if I kept winning while being the kind of person who kept winning, the grief had nowhere to sit, and it started to shiver in public. Because I found out I liked kitchens better than stages and could not persuade myself that this was an improvement some days. Because.\u201d She did not wrap it in a bow. The wheels of the city carried a distant siren along.\n\nZita watched her the way a person in a closed carriage watches the weather through a crack, searching for a meaning beyond dampness. \u201cI thought it would be something uglier,\u201d she said, almost disappointed. \u201cI brought uglier answers with me. I packed them carefully.\u201d She had. They showed under her coat like gashes she had drawn in shadow where no one could touch them without taking her side. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she added fiercely. \u201cAsk a sharp thing and see if I bleed in a way the audience will clap for.\u201d\n\nMagda had a sharp thing ready. It sat in her mouth and tasted like a coin that has passed through too many hands. The wheel creaked and told her they had one more turn before the eighth. She could ask something that would make Zita say a name, and the name would be currency, and Magda could spend it in all the ways she had promised herself she no longer enjoyed. Or she could ask for generosity and make a liar of herself and a fool too, and fools do not survive these rooms unless the room is merciful and the wheel was a machine, not a god. She thought of mustard. She thought of three tiny seeds in a pocket warming by a body. She thought of how seeds do not care why they are carried; they care only for when. \u201cWho taught you to cheat?\u201d was what the crowd wanted. \u201cWho taught you not to be gentle?\u201d was what a better person would say. She surprised them both and herself. \u201cWhat did you leave behind,\u201d she asked softly, \u201cwhen you walked from Leoben? The first thing. Without telling yourself a story about why.\u201d\n\nIt was a question with a hook in it. Place questions can be refused, but they leave splinters. Zita\u2019s face went very still. Her eyes did the little flick not toward a wire but toward something inside her head that had a very small child\u2019s room in it. \u201cA ring,\u201d she said at last. She made the sound of a person swallowing not pride but a small burst of contempt for her former self. \u201cVery thin. It belonged to someone who told me to wait in a way that made waiting feel like being put in a cupboard. I left it on a post by the bridge with a bus to Vienna due in twelve minutes. I told myself I would come back for it and then I did not.\u201d It was ordinary. It was not ordinary at all. Somewhere below, someone with a romantic disposition clutched at a chest that had weathered three wars and a renovation, and told the person beside them a story about the time they had left something small and metal in a place where rain could find it.\n\nThe eighth came over them like a coat you have loved without cleaning too often. The bell at the carousel measured it. The wheel took it slowly because it had been asked a good question and had been given two answers that fit more or less into the holes the world had left in their respective bodies. The camera whirred the way a small animal whirs when it is asleep and dreaming of running. The voice had a penultimate thing to say, because of course it did: \u201cFinal. Declare your instrument.\u201d It was an archaic requirement from the days when men said sword and pistol and had eyelashes so long they cast shadows on their cheeks in oil paintings. The modern version was a formality that usually produced words like intellect, charm, grit, and team. Zita lifted her hand. \u201cAudience,\u201d she said, with a frankness that was almost tender. \u201cI have become what I am because you want what I am and I am not ashamed of having learned to be it. You are my instrument. That is a compliment and a theft.\u201d Her voice softened on the last word in a way that would make very many people forgive her.\n\nMagda placed her palm against the cabin again. \u201cPlace,\u201d she said. \u201cI am an instrument when something notices where it is being asked to happen. Streets. Kitchens. Wheels. That and the way names sit in the mouth. And the way coffee hands over what it learns when it passes through ground. And the person who braided my hair. And the person who has never once asked me to be smaller so they could feel taller. Those are my instruments.\u201d She did not look down when she said person. She did not say Petra\u2019s name. She had learned that names in these rooms grew teeth and would chew up your foot if you dangled it too close to the floor. The wood under her hand was warm now enough that she could feel the pulse of the axle through it, a small repetition like the word yes when said by someone who rarely uses it.\n\nThe wheel slowed. The world below was still the world, which meant you could buy roasted chestnuts if you wanted and watch a horse drag a cart of beer with a dignity that would have made old Dukes jealous. The cabin slid into its lowermost thought. The latch was readying itself for home. \u201cVerdict,\u201d the voice said, hungry to be done before it embarrassed itself by seeming human. Magda watched Zita\u2019s shoulder blades under her coat move as she took a breath to tolerate the sensation of being weighed by anything other than her own need. The crowd arranged its faces into listening. The man with the key scratched his ear again because habit is a kind of shelter.\n\nWhat the wheel would say was none of the camera\u2019s business, not for that moment. It belonged to wood and to the law and to the wet breath of a million people who had stood and kissed and fought and eaten in the radius of its shadow. It had one job left: to make the eighth turn contain not only motion but a memory that would attach itself to the two women in the cabin in a way neither of them could pick off later and call stain. The bell in the carousel sang one last time with all the formality of a civil servant who knew his work was delicate even if his tools were crude. The cabin rocked. The latch lifted its chin. The wind lifted hair and then laid it down.\n\n\u201cHold,\u201d said the wheel quietly, not to the voice and not to the camera and not to the people. It was a word it had learned from brakes. \u201cHold and know.\u201d The door did not open yet. The turn took its time. Magda smiled without showing teeth again, because it was all she knew to do at the edge of the idea of an ending. Zita\u2019s hand went absently to the thin ring on her thumb, and for the first time since stepping into the cabin she looked like someone who had been small and alone and then had put on a coat and practiced three faces until they obeyed. Down below, Petra licked her thumb and drew a circle on the wood of the wheelhouse and finished it, and made a face at the clipboard woman, who did not see but would be aware later that a kindness had happened near her in a way that made her day more possible. And far up in the steel, in a place where no one cleaned because no one could reach, something small and black with bright eyes peered down and thought about the heat of language and about the way questions, like kettles, know when to sing.",

The wheel had said hold, and because it had been built by men who trusted their hands more than anything that called itself a system, it obeyed its own command without waiting for permission. There was a sympathetic hush from below that had nothing to do with production and everything to do with bodies understanding that a thing was deciding something in their presence. Zita\u2019s eyes did their small private arithmetic and came up briefly empty, which made her beautiful and terrible in a way that would have moved an older painter to start a new school.\n\n\u201cBy scope declared and place acknowledged,\u201d said the wheel at last, and the voice from the ceiling transcribed as best it could, a clerk being asked to take dictation from weather. \u201cBy breath given to air that was being told how to behave. By the old municipal courtesy that pretends to be shy and is not. Contest is incomplete because instrument was overbroad and because wire whispered in a room that promised silence.\u201d The words were not words, not how courts make them, and yet they came as sentences do when you have trained your mouth to be reliable. The camera panicked and steadied; somewhere a producer swallowed a series of noises that would have gotten him fired if he had let them become audible. Petra smiled so slightly that only the woman with the clipboard, whose job had taught her to notice small resistances, saw and pretended not to.\n\n\u201cWhat does incomplete look like,\u201d Zita asked, and to her credit she put no sugar on it, no tilt of the chin to indicate she would turn even an insult into inventory. Her hand had left the ring and returned to it; you could tell only because her thumb was blushed pale where the metal had pressed. Magda felt the cat\u2019s absence as a shape and guessed, without needing to look, that the bright-eyed thing high in the iron had been her inconvenient familiar deciding to experience the city from a place we pretend is only for pigeons and maintenance men. The wheel creaked once, as if it were warming itself to the work of an answer no one had asked it in a hundred years.\n\n\u201cIncomplete means return,\u201d the wheel said, and the bell across the square answered with a single tongue against bronze, an involuntary amen. \u201cTwo turns hence the cabin will open again in the presence of those who insist on witnessing. Petitioner\u2019s advantage is halved by the speaking wire and will be made equal by the thing under glass called a kitchen, in a room the respondent names. Between now and then, neither may speak aloud the name of the other in public, under penalty of poor luck in small matters and a mildew that chooses its own corners. Questions may be asked of place, not of person, and place will answer if it wants to. Instruments are declared and will not be traded without notice. Hold and know.\u201d It was bureaucratic in the way storms are bureaucratic\u2014they have procedures, they follow them, they do not tend to write reports.\n\n\u201cSo we are scolded and sent to wash our hands,\u201d Zita said quietly, and she looked, for a breath, like a girl being told dinner is at six and she must earn it by setting the table. The glare she sent the camera was so small most eyes missed it, but the machine did not, and it shivered in its casing like a dog that has learned to fear a certain tone. Magda let out a breath she did not know she had been hiring to keep her spine straight. She didn\u2019t look at Petra. Looking at Petra now would send a thread across the cabin the way children once strung string between two tin cans and pretended the voice came clean; that thread would be cut by the thing that called itself spectacle and then wrapped around their throats like an ornament.\n\nThe latch gave up its resistance, and the door prepared to return to being a door instead of a mouth. The crowd made the communal decision to applaud, but because the verdict had not been a verdict, the sound hiccuped into something like polite laughter and then sorted itself into a warm, complicated noise that could not be put on a showreel with confidence. The woman with the clipboard wrote a word Magda could not see and then wrote another and then underlined both with the concentration of a person who understood that underline was not merely emphasis but conjuration. The operator, whose name would never be printed anywhere because he had the caution of someone who had once watched two boys climb under the wheel without knowing what they were playing with, scratched his ear again and muttered to the lever. The lever, instructed by a thousand nights of work, ignored him with respect.\n\n\u201cTwo turns hence,\u201d Magda said, because even when a machine had spoken it, the sentence wanted a human mouth to register properly in the air. She softened the words as she sent them out, a habit learned in courtyards where doors have learned, through long acquaintance with refugees and salesmen, to open only for certain kinds of wind. Zita\u2019s mouth took its neutral expression back as if taking off a hat that had started to itch. \u201cFine,\u201d she said, and the fine was so thickly varnished with acceptance that no one saw the splinters under it unless they were looking hard. \u201cI hope your kitchen is clean. I hope your knives have no ghosts.\u201d It was not a threat. It was a professional courtesy expressed in blade length.\n\nThey stepped out and the cold took both women equally, which pleased Magda in a childish way she did not mind indulging just now. The first few rows of the crowd\u2014those who had decided to have faces and names tonight rather than be a generality\u2014leaned in as if expecting autographs on the air. A man whose day job was selling budget insurance on the phone said aloud to his companion that he had never realized how much the Ferris wheel sounded like the organ at St. Roch\u2019s when the priest was new and enthusiastic. Petra reached Magda just beyond the circle the clipboard\u2019s lanyard had declared sacred and temporary, and she did the thing you do when you have no ritual prepared for what you must acknowledge: she touched the back of Magda\u2019s head just above the nape, as if to reassure the hair that it had done correctly staying braided.\n\n\u201cYou were yourself,\u201d Petra said in a tone that refused to put frosting on praise. \u201cShe was herself too, which is a pity because I sometimes wish people like her would be other people on Tuesdays. The wheel was an old bureaucrat who discovered for a second it could have a soul, and then remembered it had to be at work again in the morning. Do we drink something that burns or something that sweetens your mouth enough to keep you from biting anyone who comes near you on the tram.\u201d\n\n\u201cBurn me and then sweeten me,\u201d Magda said, and it made Petra bark a laugh that sent three small birds off the roof of the nearby ticket kiosk. The woman with the clipboard approached then with the look of someone whose job required delivering information to people who might choose to eat the information and the messenger both. She held out a folded paper in a plastic sleeve with a stamp that did not exist outside the city\u2019s secret drawers. Her eyebrows did not bother attempting sympathy; her mouth had never practiced it.\n\n\u201cBy the office that watches the oath,\u201d the woman said, and she did not apologize for the office, which was good manners, \u201cyou are notified that the second session will be permitted as declared if you furnish the address within twelve hours. Kitchens must comply with ventilation standards. The device with the camera will be admitted if it remembers to be respectful. The wire will be tested for silence with a bowl of water and a spoon. If the spoon moves, the bowl goes out the window and the broadcast loses its rights for a quarter under section nine. Sign.\u201d She had two pens and offered the nice one first. Magda took the less nice one because there are small resistances she will never give up.\n\n\u201cI will send the address in an hour,\u201d Magda said, and she felt Petra\u2019s arm solid beside her, a post a horse might be tied to without humiliation. Zita took her copy and did not look at it; she slid it into the pocket inside her coat that had been sewn by hands that knew this was where a person kept the documents they could not afford to lose. She caught Magda\u2019s eye then and allowed herself a brief grinning: the grin was a truce flag made of foil, attractive and disposable. \u201cI hope you cook first,\u201d she said. \u201cI dislike kitchens that pretend to be museums. And I hope your neighbor upstairs does not practice a tuba on Thursdays because the camera is allergic to tubas.\u201d She turned away before either of them could answer, because control depends on the appearance of never waiting to be dismissed.\n\nThey did not take the tram. The cold made the air something you could lean on, and the walk back was a way to unknot ankles that had tried to understand a moving room. Petra bought chestnuts from a man who had burned his fingers so often he had lost the habit of flinching. The paper cone warmed their palms through their gloves, and the smoke underlined the night with a line of text streetlights could not parse. A boy ran past and shouted into the ice, \u201cShe\u2019s going to fight in a kitchen,\u201d with the joy of someone who had learned a new rule for a game he planned to cheat at and win honestly anyway. The boy\u2019s mother followed and said his name\u2014and because names are spells, he slowed and let her catch his sleeve without complaint.\n\n\u201cThere is a spoon that knows too much in my second drawer,\u201d Magda said, as if they had been discussing shopping lists all along. \u201cIt will tell stories to the bowl until the office becomes embarrassed and praises its compliance with a stamp. I will choose the big pot with the dent, because I do not trust pots that are confident. Will you come at seven and pretend to be a person who is just here for salt.\u201d Petra nodded as someone who had already planned the morning\u2019s thefts and kindnesses might. \u201cI will bring bread and nothing sharper than my tongue,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cat will sit on the fridge and criticize your chopping. Bruno will try to come and pretend to fix something so that he can be present for posterity and write about it in his small ugly notebook. I will tell him there is a fee for men with notebooks and watch him go home briskly.\u201d\n\nIn the stairwell of her building the light did its midnight trick of arguing with the timer, and they climbed the last flights in a glow no one had paid for. The cat was sitting on the table as if it had been paid to supervise and was willing to accept late payment in fish. Its ears said three rooms had said unwise things while they were gone and two had made soup. It examined the plastic sleeve, sneezed with disdain, and then turned its attention to a small draft coming from the window where the seal was insufficient in winter and wonderfully permissive in spring. \u201cWe will host a part of the city,\u201d Magda told it, because houses like to be informed when they are about to be asked to perform. \u201cWe will wash, and we will hide certain things in the drawer you cannot open without pebbles and a curse, and we will leave the sugar where it can save a sentence that wants to curdle.\u201d\n\nShe wrote the address on a card made for doctors\u2019 waiting rooms and slid it into the envelope the clipboard woman had left. She wrote the words in a hand that did not want to be read by people who intended to argue about kerning. The kitchen looked at her then, the way kitchens look, with a severity born of having seen every kind of human attempt either to keep promises or to abandon them with style. She said aloud that she was grateful for the stove\u2019s stubbornness and for the way the water in this building sometimes ran brown for three seconds and then fixed itself without being asked. Gratitude is a lubricant as well as a salve; the pipes hummed with the satisfaction of being seen.\n\nShe did not sleep. That was not a decision but a weather system. Petra, who could fall asleep against a wall in a well-lit station while a man with a violin practiced murder beside her, installed herself on the couch with her boots off and announced in a conversational voice how many tiles were on the ceiling if you counted only the whole ones. The cat prowled the dawn, which arrived bruised and unrepentant. Letters slid under the door with the practiced insolence of the city; one was from the office, stamped and official like a promise made by a person you love and slightly do not trust; one was a postcard from a woman in Croatia who sent Magda listless drawings of shells; one was a flier for teeth whitening that had stolen its font from a revolution. Magda drank coffee and then tea and then water and thought about the word incomplete until it became a gift rather than an insult.\n\nAt eight in the morning a municipal employee whose badge had sat muttering in a drawer for weeks rang the bell. He carried a bowl, a spoon, a checklist, and a look of long-suffering professionalism that had become in him almost an art. He was small and fastidious and looked like a person who had resisted becoming somebody\u2019s father only to discover late that fatherliness came in other forms and had found him anyway. \u201cI am here to test your air for opinions,\u201d he said, and he didn\u2019t smile because he did not want to be the kind of civil servant who made light of the work. \u201cThe spoon must move only when invited. The bowl must not tremble. You must sign, and if you cheat I will tell your grandmother.\u201d Those lines were written and had been handed to him; he had learned to deliver them without bitterness because bitterness curdles spoons.\n\nMagda brought him into the kitchen with the respect due a priest who had renounced all gods but holds the power to declare your bread legal tender. He set the bowl on the table, which tried not to remember the black wax mark. He placed the spoon in the bowl with a gentleness that implied he had once, perhaps as a boy, spoken to small river creatures and expected them to answer. \u201cThere will be a question,\u201d he said, studying a stopwatch as if it owed him an apology. \u201cWhen it is asked, the spoon will want to argue. You will not let it. Are you ready.\u201d Magda looked at Petra, who refrained from making the spoon laugh by telling it a story about a man in a bar who had mistaken his own reflection for a friend. \u201cWe are ready,\u201d Magda said, and the cat, on the fridge, sighed as if to say it had seen this trick and found it theatrically effective but narratively lazy.\n\nThe voice from last night was piped in thinly through a device the inspector set on the table, a cylinder of metal perforated like an old theater voice. It asked a dull question, something about ordinance subclauses that would put an inkpot to sleep. The spoon twitched. The bowl did not. Petra put two fingers lightly on the table as if soothing a nervous horse. Magda drew a circle only in her head and did not finish it, a courtesy to a spoon that had not asked to be a proxy for ethics. The spoon considered humility and decided to be cooperative today. The inspector clicked his stopwatch and nodded once, the nod of a man whose job at last goes as intended, a relief so rare it felt foreign.\n\n\u201cCompliance noted,\u201d he said, filling a small square on a larger square with ink. \u201cYour kitchen smells like someone who can translate sadness into soup, which is not on the form but should be. At fourteen hundred hours the technicians will inspect your outlets for spirits. If they find any, they will leave them outside in a jar, and you can keep them if you wish. They have learned not to make friends with what they harvest because of an incident in Ottakring involving a boy who fell in love with a draft. At nineteen hundred hours the recording equipment will arrive and then your privacy ends until we write it down that it begins again. Please have mercy on the crew. They eat badly, and it makes them mean.\u201d He packed the spoon and the bowl away as if tucking a child into a stroller and let the clock in his body sweep him back into the city.\n\nThe day stretched itself across the building. The woman upstairs did not practice the tuba; instead she played a song on a piano that had suffered for its art and came through the ceiling like smoke. Bruno came and did try to fix something, as Petra had prophesied, and accepted the fee for men with notebooks with more grace than expected and retreated with his dignity intact and his notebook heavier for it. The cat disappeared and reappeared with a scrap of foil in its mouth as if making an offering to a god of artificial light. Magda cooked because cooking made the air rounder and less likely to pick up whispers and because you cannot lead a city into your kitchen and feed it nothing but rules.\n\nIn the afternoon, a young woman with hair dyed a decisive green knocked and presented a form in triplicate that demanded permission to film the hallway for transitional shots. She looked at the wall where a bicycle had scraped a bruise last year and saw in it a future scene where a woman walks away from a camera and everyone at home thinks, for a moment, that they could follow her and they do not. She kindly put blue masking tape along the floor where tripods must not stand because your neighbor downstairs had confessed she had once been stuck in a doorway while carrying three loaves of bread and had not recovered her courage. Petra brewed coffee until the room could balance on the smell alone. Magda moved knives around until their placement said respect instead of threat, and then she moved them again because superstition builds furniture and she wanted to be sure the chairs it made would not collapse under a polite person.\n\nEvening approached like a neighbor who knows whether to borrow sugar or to bring cake. The crew arrived carrying cases that looked like coffins for small robots. The camera flinched when it saw the stove as if remembering last night\u2019s small glare and wanted to apologize without using language. The man who monitored sound had ears like shells, and he wore a hat that had decided already how long it planned to remain on his head. He tested the walls by tapping them with a knuckle and listened to the returns as if listening for a tone only he knew the names of. He asked whether there had ever been a child crying in this room for two hours while someone did something with apples, and when Magda said yes he told the wall to behave because echoes love to think they are the most important people in the room.\n\nAt seven, the woman with the clipboard came with a new clipboard, which suggested the old one had been sent to a drawer to calm down. She read the formality that hung between them like a curtain and let it drop. The city was in the doorway now. It had taken off its hat. It wanted to be fed and adjudicated and permitted to have an opinion that would not be punished in the morning. Zita arrived without a coat and without the expression she wore for stages. She was smaller in a kitchen, not because the room diminished her but because power has to change shoes when it crosses thresholds. She looked around as if taking an inventory, then laughed once in the direction of the kettle, which had just then decided to whistle, a coincidence she chose to let become an omen.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d Magda said, and the word did something to the light. It made it warmer without making it brighter. She held out a plate because kitchens know what they are for, and Zita took a slice of bread as if it were a failure to admit hunger in front of witnesses. Petra nodded to her as a person nods to someone who has just explained their own burden honestly. The cat launched itself with practiced indifference onto the fridge and looked down as if judging a parade. Outside the window the world behaved; snow made a clean noise against the glass; a siren passed as if ashamed of needing attention.\n\nThe voice from the ceiling was humbler here. It had the sound of being poured out of an enamel cup rather than a goblet. \u201cTwo turns hence,\u201d it said, obedient to the wheel\u2019s arithmetic, and the operator across town touched the lever in the wheelhouse not because he needed to but because habit extends itself through the city when invoked. \u201cContest resumes, instrument declared. Scope halved and equalized by pot, knife, heat. Air tested compliant. Witnesses present. Officiant: place.\u201d The camera tucked itself into the corner and tried not to cast a shadow that would make the chopping board anxious.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do, then,\u201d Zita asked, and there was curiosity in it unadorned by a pose. The question made her more dangerous in the way a child with a stick becomes dangerous only when she learns it is a wand if you pretend correctly and ask politely. Magda looked at the book on the shelf with the blue thread and did not take it down because she had learned the temptation of reading the spell instead of being hospitable to it. She lifted a pot and set it on the stove so lightly the iron did not dare complain.\n\n\u201cWe ask place to tell us what it knows,\u201d she said, and she thought she felt the knot of the city move, the way a sleeping dog shifts and remembers that it is entrusted with entire rooms. \u201cWe will not ask about saints. We will not ask about ratings. We will ask the table why it remembers certain elbows and what they meant. We will ask the floor what footprints it has chosen to keep. We will ask the sink what it has refused to swallow. If you cheat in here, the coffee will burn you and the sugar will pretend to be salt and every parsley leaf will turn away from your knife. If I cheat, the cupboard will refuse to open and the matches will break, and Petra will not talk to me for two days.\u201d She smiled then because she had almost made herself a liar on purpose by promising punishment she could not guarantee.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Zita said, and there was eagerness there she could not keep out. She put her palms on the table and did an old thing by accident; she asked blessing without pronouncing the word and the table, having seen worse, granted a provisional approval. The voice in the corner drew a breath for its opening and then thought better of it. The clipboard, endowed for the evening with something like a conscience, sat very still and did not tap itself against the woman\u2019s leg.\n\nMagda poured water into the pot and added salt and then did not count breaths because counting would make it a show and she had not invited show, despite the camera\u2019s presence. She put onions on a board and cut them. She did not weep because she had wept last year and the onions recognized her as kin. Zita watched and did the respectful thing; she did not offer to help; she did not pretend ignorance; she let the knife make a conversation with wood and flesh and the green center of a sprig of savory. \u201cAsk your first,\u201d Magda said, because generosity is a resource and if you hoard it the pipes go dry. She kept her eyes on the knife as a courtesy to both of them.\n\n\u201cWhat is the oldest thing in this room,\u201d Zita asked, and then, because the law required specificity, \u201cthat still remembers being something else.\u201d Her voice sought the corners. It did not command. It waited. The kitchen, which had not been asked so directly in years if ever, rustled. The sugar made a small avalanche; the stove clicked twice. Petra, who had been born with a river running the length of her spine and a coal cellared somewhere above her heart, looked at the windowsill where a jar sat that had once held cherries.\n\n\u201cThe towel,\u201d said the room, and Magda startled a little that it had decided to speak aloud and not through muscle memory and the small adjustments that happen when you cook right. \u201cThe towel was a shirt,\u201d the room said, \u201cand before it was a shirt it was a tablecloth for a picnic where two people said unwise things under trees, and before that it was a sheet on a bed in a room where a man who had done everything badly once did one thing well and then tried to make a habit of it and failed.\u201d The voice did not come from one point; it came from all the places where cloth remembers skin. The camera, poor creature, had no setting for this; it hummed in sympathy and hoped that sympathetic hum would be legible to the office later when the forms had to be justified.\n\n\u201cSecond,\u201d Magda said, and the onion consented to be browned rather than burned. \u201cWhat does the sink refuse to swallow.\u201d She knew the answer but asked because rooms like to be asked to say what they have been forced to tolerate. \u201cPromises,\u201d said the sink at once, and Petra clapped her hands once before remembering she was not here to applaud plumbing. \u201cIt spits them back. It will take blood if you let it, and it will complain and then forgive. But it will not take promises if you whisper them into the drain. They sound like bones trying to be whistles.\u201d Zita made a sound that might have been a laugh and might have been a kind of surprise. She touched the lip of the sink, and then snatched her hand back without thinking because the lip had been warmed by hot water and domesticity, and she had expected obligation to be colder.\n\n\u201cThird,\u201d the voice from the ceiling tried in a small way to re-establish its dignity. \u201cUnder the oath\u2019s kitchen clause, both parties will now declare a memory of this place not told before to outsiders, to ground themselves in something other than performance.\u201d The clause had been written by a municipal clerk who had once saved a child from choking by lying convincingly about the presence of a toy in the next room, and had then gone home and made soup with hands that would not stop shaking.\n\n\u201cI burned a pot,\u201d Magda said, and it felt like a benediction because it was so simple. \u201cIt was summer. I was in love with a woman who liked to pretend that being late had been outlawed. I watched a sparrow on the windowsill and thought I could be someone different if I learned to stand still exactly as long as a small bird takes to assess a threat. The pot took offense at the neglect and became black at the bottom as if it had been reading some philosophy I disapprove of. I kept the pot because I wanted to have in this room a thing that would survive my attention wandering.\u201d\n\n\u201cI slept on that floor,\u201d Zita said, surprising them both, and the floor answered with a small creak as if to say it had been expecting to be brought in at the end, as a witness no one had bothered to list. \u201cI slept here two years ago after a party. I did not know it was your floor. I did not know this was your kitchen. I woke up and ate something that had been left out on the table and confessed a lie to a jar and then told it to keep its mouth shut. It did. It was cherries.\u201d The jar, flattered, adjusted its glass the way a very old person adjusts a collar when told they have done their hair correctly. Petra raised her eyebrows and then lowered them as if storing a question for a day when the city was less in the room.\n\nOn the stove, the water behaved. On the sill, the savory let go of its sting into steam. The city outside sat, attentive as a cat in a beam of sun, choosing for once to be the audience rather than the act. Magda tucked a strand of hair behind her ear that had escaped Petra\u2019s braid and thought about how answers come differently in rooms that have agreed to receive them. Zita\u2019s face had lost the small tension that television insists on; she was listening with vanity briefly in abeyance. The voice in the ceiling asked something important then, because even voices earn their keep on strange nights.\n\n\u201cAdmit cost,\u201d it said, and the cupboard door chose this moment to ease itself open, as if to agree that public accounting had its place. \u201cAdmit what you will pay if you keep being exactly who you are in rooms like this and in rooms like the one on the wheel. Do not be elegant. Do not weaponize it. Put it on the table with the bread and let witnesses decide whether they want to eat it.\u201d The question had come out of an ordinance that had itself been born of a scandal with eels and a photograph and a judge who wore his sorrow badly; it had been shaped since then by people who had to put their names to papers that would outlive their bodies.\n\n\u201cMy mother will keep dying in small ways,\u201d Magda said, because she had never found a kinder way to put it even in her mind. \u201cI will be thought difficult by men who want me to be gentle in exactly the way they are used to being consoled. I will be loved less often in public by people who do not like to applaud a person who refuses to give them the version with neat corners. I will write fewer invoices and more recipes, and the balance will become precarious. I will be boring on Wednesdays. I will be someone the city calls on when it is tired of being lied to and then forgets to invite when it wants a story told at a certain speed.\u201d She set the ladle down and let the steam wash her mouth with the taste of salt that had not yet become soup.\n\n\u201cI will be alone unless I decide not to be and then I will be less good at the work I was made for,\u201d Zita said, and her lip curled on the last words not because she did not believe them but because believing them had become an insult she liked to throw into corners. \u201cI will be envied, which is a tax, and I will be punished, which is also a tax, and I will pay both because I like buying things that make other people uncomfortable. I will be wrong publicly once in a way that will be turned into a comic T-shirt sold by men with rucksacks and a contempt for women who are not their mothers. I will have nowhere to put tenderness except in places that do not deserve it or want to be seen doing so.\u201d She held out her palms as if to show they were empty and the room in a very quiet way made them heavy with the small weight of flour motes and the larger weight of not lying.\n\nThe wheel, across town, felt the pot come to a boil and had an urge it rarely had in the winter: it wanted to stop moving and come into a room where women were using the correct verbs for their lives. The operator scolded the lever for being sentimental and drank his tea, which had been made irresponsibly strong by a niece who was trying to learn contempt from the radio. The bell at the carousel missed a beat and then remembered itself and pretended it had meant to.\n\n\u201cVerdict,\u201d said the place, because even kitchens like endings when the soup is ready and the knives are arranged like well-behaved planets. It did not say who had won; it said instead what must happen if they insisted on continuing to make nights like this in this city where the rules sometimes are written on napkins and sometimes on marble and sometimes on beer. \u201cPetitioner will not bring wires into rooms that answer. Respondent will not punish victory with scorn. Both will feed the witnesses. If you are to do this again\u2014and you will, because the city likes it and your bones like it more than you admit\u2014you will do it with the understanding that scope includes mercy and not only theater. The oath of contest is amended in this kitchen for the space of one winter and the width of this table. If someone disapproves, they may take it up with the wheel when it is in the mood to entertain complaints.\u201d The clipboard scribbled as if trying to keep up and failing; the woman holding it made the face of a person told that an extra line must be fitted into a page already full.\n\nZita laughed then with something like gratitude braided into the sound, and even the cat forgave it. \u201cSo I am asked to win kindly,\u201d she said, and she shrugged with delicacy and a certain ferocity, as if to say that kindness could be its own spectacle if taught to pose. \u201cSo I am asked to not build my throne out of knives and then call it furniture. I have been asked worse by people with worse rooms.\u201d She took a bowl from Magda\u2019s hand and accepted soup as if someone had awarded her a prize that had not been paid for by injury.\n\nPetra, whose wrists had become spoons from decades of stirring when no one else would do it, pulled chairs out with the authority of a person who knows what to do with people exposed briefly to truth. The crew looked at each other as men do when told that their job will require them to be humans in a place that expects it and will mark them down for doing it wrong. The clipboard woman put the pen on the table and ate bread as someone who had been hungry and had not known. The city, at the window, fogged the glass and wrote a rude word and then wiped it off itself, embarrassed and entertained, because it had learned tonight that it enjoyed being asked to tell stories by rooms that knew the shape of a sentence before it was born.\n\nThey ate. The camera took what it could get and did not get in the way. The voice in the corner tried to remember a hymn and discovered it could not, which relieved it of a certain anxiety. Zita and Magda did not drink to each other because toasts are promises and they had already made one to place; they did touch the rims of their bowls together once in a gesture that belonged in a story Orpheus would have enjoyed if he had been born in a housing estate. Petra talked about nothing of consequence across the top of it all, which is to say she served as priest and entertainer both without acknowledging herself as either.\n\nLater, much later, when even the city had fallen briefly quiet and the footage had been copied to three drives and labeled with words that would make no sense to anyone who had not had to testify in a room with fluorescent lighting, Magda stood alone in the kitchen in the kind of silence that had earned her regard. The cat rubbed its face along the leg of a chair, rendering it formally the cat\u2019s property under a law no office had ever dared to write down. She looked at the pot, at the towel, at the bowl that had behaved for the inspector because it prefers to please when asked correctly, and she let herself consider the word incomplete again. It no longer tasted like defeat; it tasted like yeast, which makes things rise if you do not rush it and makes a mess if you do. She turned the clocks to face the wall and let the apartment catch its breath. She did not sleep. She did not need to. The night had been its own rest, a kind of work that, for once, paid her back in the currency she preferred: a room she loved being more itself because she had asked it to be.",

                              "content": "By morning the city\u2019s appetite for rules had sobered, and a thin light in the kitchen admitted itself with the caution of a clerk who knows both how to refuse and how to bend. The clocks were still facing the wall, which meant time had been asked to sit in the corner and keep its voice down. The cat had slept on the chair with its paws folded in a way that suggested piety and mischief had shaken hands, and its whiskers held the memory of steam though no kettle had sung for hours. Magda\u2019s body had the particular ache given by nights that are both argument and feast. She stood at the window and watched the courtyard consider frost, which it did each winter the way some people consider religion: suspiciously and with an almost sensual calculation of inconvenience.\n\nThe papers did their part by not printing what had happened and letting their headlines behave as if truth would stain if handled improperly. A columnist wrote that the giant wheel had been unusually philosophical, which made three tram drivers in three different districts laugh at exactly the same minute, not because they had read the column, but because the wheel\u2019s small squeal in the cold had hit a note that felt like gossip. A talk radio host made the mistake of saying someone\u2019s name in the wrong spirit while describing a kitchen, and an hour later the studio found a damp luxuriance blooming under a light switch in the shape of a continent that did not exist. He took the hint and referred thereafter to \u201cthe arithmetic pilgrim\u201d and \u201cthe woman with the stubborn towel,\u201d which worked about as well as cheap maps work in fog.\n\nThere was a letter slid under the door that looked like a bill and smelled like discretion. The office that watched the oath had printed on municipal stock a thank-you that doubled as a warning. It suggested that kitchens, when asked to officiate, would henceforth be afforded the same protections as public monuments, with a footnote explaining that public monuments should try, when possible, not to sulk if draped briefly in scarves. It reminded all named parties in polite small type that in public spaces they must call each other \u201cthe petitioner\u201d and \u201cthe respondent\u201d or, failing that, \u201cthe person\u201d and \u201cthe other person,\u201d and that if they forgot, mildew would decide to take interest in the undersides of their wooden chairs. The letter offered a number to call in case mildew became ideological rather than housekeeping, which made Petra snort coffee ground-fine through her nose when she read it and earned the paper a place on the fridge until the magnet it clung to developed a sense of entitlement and slid off.\n\nMagda\u2019s phone swarmed with messages written by people who were not quite sure what they had witnessed and wanted to be certain they had not been the only ones. There were congratulations that tried to be unassuming and failed, admonitions that tried to sound intimate and tripped, and one exquisite note from a woman who wrote simply that she had for the first time in years refused to clap when asked even though clapping had been her habit and had kissed her husband in the doorway instead, because doorways had felt promoted. There were also two requests for appointments, one about a set of keys that had started to lock their owner out from the inside, another concerning a music box that played a march in reverse on Tuesday evenings and had begun, disconcertingly, to make a child\u2019s footprints appear in flour.\n\nShe boiled water and made tea because coffee would have joined the morning too fast and tea was better at easing itself into a room and asking where the chairs liked to stand. The cat leapt onto the table in a movement that gave the lie to gravity and sat with the purposeful nonchalance of a foreman regulating a crew. It examined the stove, blammed its eyes at the window where a small feather had lodged between glass and frame, and then looked at her with that specific attention which means: I have been listening to the neighbors through the pipes and three of them were very unwise after midnight. \u201cI am not here to scold anyone\u2019s pleasure,\u201d Magda said, and the cat flattened its ears in agreement that pleasure belongs to itself until it knocks asking at the wrong hour.\n\nPetra arrived before noon with two loaves tucked under her arm and, in her coat pocket, a small roll of blue tape used by film crews to make the world behave for twenty minutes. She moved like someone who had slept on the couch and dreamed in straight lines for once. They kissed each other\u2019s cheeks in the doorway without chatter because routine had a beauty that did not like to be decorated. \u201cBruno asked if you would autograph his fee,\u201d Petra said, setting the bread down and turning her mug upright with the tenderness of a person who has loved and scolded a country into remembering how to be kind. \u201cI told him that money is already an autograph and if he wanted more I would sign his shoe with a word that would embarrass him by its accuracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are going to make a version,\u201d Magda said, and what she meant was the show, the office, the city, the friends they had not chosen; all the entities that love an instance enough to turn it into a pattern and then to a brand. \u201cThey will ask kitchens to act natural and build sets that break your hip because realism measures differently on a spreadsheet. They will ask coffee to confess. They will sell the way onions brown.\u201d\n\nPetra tore a crust off the loaf and spoke into the crumb as if addressing a microphone with good manners. \u201cThen we can be provincial about it,\u201d she said. \u201cNo exports. The clause says one winter. The clause says the width of this table. Anyone who brings a crew into a kitchen without first obtaining permission from the towel will find themselves making soup with water that refuses to boil and parsley that declines to be chopped.\u201d She swallowed, caught the cat trotting past with something crinkled in its mouth, and liberated the object, which proved to be another strip of foil embossed with stars that had escaped a chocolate. \u201cHe has begun to tithe,\u201d she said, her voice admiring and affronted in equal measure. \u201cHe thinks the apartment is a temple and he is its complicated god.\u201d\n\nThey walked out into the day because staying in would have taught the curtains to expect attention, and curtains with expectations become tyrants. The city had put on a pale blue and looked faintly cropped at its edges, as if some hand had trimmed the day to fit the frame of an old print. On the corner, a woman sold chestnuts that did not taste burned enough to be fashionable, which made them perfect. A bus sighed at a stop and confessed to three pigeons that it had been thinking about the mountains. Children had invented a chant that could get you in trouble in some places and a free sandwich in others. \u201cCabin seven, kitchen eleven,\u201d they shouted, without knowing or caring what eleven had to do with anything; it rhymed and let the feet cut air into pieces, and that was enough.\n\nNear the Prater they encountered the operator of the wheel varnishing a small section of wood as if applying balm to an old bruise. He nodded at them with the polite indifference of a person charged with caring for a thing that cannot repay him except by continuing to be itself. His moustache had been white since the last time any of them had thought they were forever. \u201cGood working,\u201d he said to Magda in the way of tradespeople who dislike making compliments into events. \u201cIt takes a particular wrist to get a thing built for forward motion to listen to something going on in a kitchen. She,\u201d he added with a tilt meant to include the wheel and the city and the operator\u2019s mother tongue and the current winter, \u201cwas proud to be asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe insists we come again, very possibly with soup,\u201d Magda said, and the man grunted, which in wheelhouse dialect meant I will make the joints not squeal the next time if I can and not let the men with the signboards crowd too near the axle. Petra, without looking up, pressed her thumb to the balustrade and traced a circle she did not finish because old men with varnish notice things and she did not wish to be thought disrespectful. Somewhere behind them a tourist explained to another tourist that the wheel had once been dismantled and rebuilt and had decided not to bear a grudge.\n\nBy afternoon the forums had stacked themselves into a precarious architecture of opinion and rumor. Users with avatars depicting saints of their own invention composed long posts about the halving of scope and the way place had been invited to have a vote. One pseudonymous voice with a tone of ferocity disguised as grace wrote that the kitchen moment had been the first time she had watched the city be permitted to address its citizens without an intermediary, and she suspected the city had enjoyed it. Another, on a board frequented by men who liked to pass off nostalgia as policy, warned darkly that allowing places to speak would only embolden teapots to file petitions. A debate flared for twenty minutes about whether mildew was a classist penalty and whether chairs in poor neighborhoods would suffer disproportionately, and then subsided into a thread about which brand of soap offends saints the least.\n\nAt the office where the oath was kept in drawers and on rooftops, a meeting unspooled with fewer speeches than usual and more silence that did not embarrass itself. A man who had inherited his position from a woman who had not believed in inheritance said that they would tolerate kitchens as officiants so long as the rooms in question had at least one window, because rooms without windows make people say forever, and forever is a word that cannot afford to be shouted. A woman whose handwriting resembled a ladder wrote in the margin of a memo that they should set aside a small fund to repair table legs, not because of sentiment but because you cannot ask a piece of wood to hold up that much law and not splint it later. No one suggested making it a show segment. The office had learned long ago that when it tried to stage its own ceremonies the city laughed very gently and documents went missing from inside of things that did not have insides.\n\nMagda collected three new tasks by simply walking down Mariahilfer Stra\u00dfe. One woman needed help persuading a pair of boots to agree that they belonged to this century and not to a grandfather who had walked himself into a war and out again with his smile rearranged. Another had brought home from a flea market a mirror so sure of its own opinion that it had refused to show her face unless she sang a particular lullaby, which she did not know and did not wish to hum in front of her bathroom because bathrooms remember. A third asked whether Magda could unstick the word please from the throat of her daughter, who had been born with ease but had learned in school that asking paints a target on your back. Magda said she could try the boots and would speak to the mirror and offered to teach the daughter how to use maybe instead and to set please aside for special occasions and persons of substance.\n\nTheir path took them past the caf\u00e9 where two years ago a woman wearing yellow had told Magda that she was tired of being told that all the city wanted from her was her prettiest sigh. The same barista, a man with forearms like melted clock faces and a devotion to crema that suggested religion without rules, glanced up and gave them both a nod that not many people received, a rare species of benediction in this city that has learned to hoard them without malice. \u201cTwo,\u201d he said, setting saucers like laws, \u201cfor the people who make rooms change their minds.\u201d He then left them to it, as is proper when a gift is too subtle to be accompanied by commentary.\n\nThey spoke of naming because the penalty for public slip now had claws and humor. Petra referred to the other woman as the one with the out-of-season cherry pits, which made Magda laugh for the first time since the wheel had said hold. Magda confessed that she had almost said the name in the hallway to the inspector with the spoon and had only saved them both from mildew by swallowing the word like fishbone and then telling the wall she was sorry to be theatrical in the morning. Petra looked around the caf\u00e9, at chairs that point to one another like accomplices and tables that have learned to ignore all but the most vivid flirtations, and said they must agree on euphemisms and change them regularly the way spies used to change train stations. They shook hands solemnly on calling her the arithmetic pilgrim when in public and the pilgrim when they were in rooms that could bear eavesdropping. They agreed to call Magda the towel\u2019s keeper when needed, and both of them enjoyed the way that sounded more dangerous than not.\n\nThe cat found them at the caf\u00e9, as it could in most places not explicitly infused with peppermint. It arrived at the exact height of the pane of glass most vulnerable to noseprints and made one, then sat on the outside table as if daring the city to pass a regulation. A crow hopped behind it and deposited a nail with intention, a small iron declaration of fealty, or perhaps barter. The cat accepted, chewed the nail in a way that would have horrified a dentist and pleased an ancestor, and then tucked it under the belly as if sitting on treasure in the only fashion available to a creature without pockets. The crow gave them both a look suggesting appreciation of the compact and then flew off, its wings spelling a word that Magda could read only if she stopped pretending to be modern.\n\nBy late afternoon, a municipal envelope with a two-headed stamp waited under the door asking to be let in. It was thick in the way of communications that intend to invoke a weight beyond their stock. Inside, a notice declared that, for the duration of one winter and for the radius defined by a table and a stove, her kitchen had been designated a venue of record for the oath\u2019s amended domestic clause. There was a paragraph about fire exits that made sense even if you disapproved of exits on principle, a stipulation concerning the presence of beings whose legal status fluctuated with the phase of the moon, and a list of small compensations the city would pay without making her ask, which meant a man would arrive with a notebook and large ears and pay her less than she deserved while trying not to be ashamed of the arithmetic. There was also a line to sign where she would agree to accept the public when it came and to refuse it in a manner that did not produce riots in the stairwell.\n\n\u201cPrepare to have your Tuesdays eaten by disputes over tongs,\u201d Petra said, reading over her shoulder and stretching her arms like a strongwoman considering whether to lift the refrigerator or persuade it to admit defeat. \u201cThey will bring tupperware with their grudges and ask the room to tell them where the leak is in their marriage. The city will adore it because it means fewer police reports in the evening and more satisfied small gods.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will be hungry,\u201d Magda said, and she wasn\u2019t talking about soup. The letter made a neat folding sound when she tamed it back into its sleeve. \u201cI will do what I can without allowing the towel to get ideas. And if the mildew comes because I forget and say pilgrim to a wall that loves rumors, you will come and scold the drawer until it dries in a decent frame of mind.\u201d\n\nThe first supplicants came not on a Tuesday but on a Sabbath disguised as Wednesday. A pair of brothers holding between them a box of biscuits too sweet for honest adults asked to use the kitchen to settle whether the earth had a sense of humor about their father\u2019s will. A woman with a baby asleep against her and cheeks that declared loudly that she never again intended to be asked to prove anything requested a space where she could tell a question to sit outside while she held her newborn up to be greeted by four corners and a drain who would forgive what it was asked to swallow later. A violinist with eyebrows like quotation marks asked if the stove would consider offering him an alibi for the night his bow had played a tune in a woman's window that did not belong to him. Magda took down names for her private book and not for the office\u2019s book and scheduled the ones that smelled like sincerity before the ones that smelled like performance, and when the door closed after each life had entered and left, she washed the handles as if the city had breathed into her hands and required a gentle forgetting.\n\nEvenings were different now because the air looked at her with work in mind. The crew returned to retrieve two cables they had sworn they had not left and to apologize to the cupboard for calling it stubborn when it had merely been conservative. The soundman with the shell ears brought a tin of shortbread as an offering, which Petra devoured with the fatalism of a woman resigned to falling in love with butter yet again, and the woman with the clipboard sat at the table after her shift and quietly wrote down, for her own peace, the number of times she had witnessed kindness without permission from a schedule. She said nothing aloud about any of it because she had learned that when you spoke about kindness in committees, men argued about definitions and invited hats to be passed.\n\nThe arithmetic pilgrim remained visible without being named, which is one of the city\u2019s specialities. She went on the radio and talked about measures and sports and the mercy of being allowed to be obvious in a world that insists on cleverness. She gave interviews to newspapers nobody read on purpose and to one paper everyone bought because they liked the crossword, and in both she argued that making room for place to moderate was innovation disguised as sentimentality. She did not say Magda\u2019s name. She called her \u201cthe respondent\u201d once and then, with impeccable care, never again, as if the word had cut her lip. A rumor, oiled and sleek, glided across the internet that she was establishing a school for people who liked to answer quickly and to take audience and air into account equally, and this would be either a noble thing or a horror depending on whether she installed windows in the rooms.\n\nOn a night when the moon had not made up its mind about light, a young man knocked at the door and asked whether she accepted parcels from archives. He had the apologetic shoulders of someone sent by a superior who had not explained that apologies are sometimes worse than silence. He handed over a flat package wrapped in brown paper stamped with the municipal crest and the symbol of a fishhook bent into a question mark but not in wax this time, in ink so dark it looked like a bruise. Inside lay a folio of copies, nothing original you could breathe on and make change its mind, and within those copies a tracing of a page from a book Magda had seen once when she was young and had believed that dusty rooms would always be patient with her. The tracing showed the seal she already knew\u2014hooked fish, question\u2014but around it a ring of careful drawings of the letter D, repeated in as many hands as could be found in the archive in the year something had fallen down and hit a bureaucrat in the softest part of his heart.\n\nThere were notes in her teacher\u2019s unsentimental hand that confirmed what the underworld of memos had suggested: the mark went back to an older association than television and a newer wickedness than empire. It belonged to a guild that had never declared itself fully because it preferred to be invited out like a ghost, and its various names all had to do with asking and collecting and the prying open of answers with grace and force alternately. The name that felt least like a pose and most like an admission was the Dowsers, which would have been ridiculous if not for the fact that in this city you could find underground water with a wire coat hanger and a headache if you knew how to listen. Below the ring of D\u2019s, a phrase had been rubbed out and then rewritten, as if someone had regretted their ink and demanded second chances of the page. The phrase read: The question that yields to one who asks with hunger owes a debt to the place that has held it, and if the place refuses, the question must be worn like a stone around the neck until it softens.\n\nShe showed the folio to Petra because secrets fare better when stored in two bodies, particularly when one of those bodies belongs to a woman who can lift an unwieldy truth without creating a drama about her own biceps. They traced the notes with their eyes and made small maps of the city in the air above the table. They named corners where questions had drained away by themselves and corners where people loved to ask and rarely answered. They discussed whether the arithmetic pilgrim wore the ring with the fishhook as an advertisement or as a debt owed to hands she had shaken, and whether she had been taught to flick her eyes by people who preferred rooms with no soft furniture.\n\nThe cat interrupted by dragging a small object into the middle of the paper and dropping it with the complex pride of a creature who has brought you a thing that is not edible but important. It was a button made of smoke-coloured glass, the kind you find in old tins in old drawers in kitchens that have known both good and unkind women. In the button was embedded a hair, black and fine, and around the hole a faint scratch the exact shape of a letter the city refuses to pronounce when in a good mood. Magda picked it up and held it to the light and watched as the glass decided whether or not to be honest about what it had seen. \u201cHe has learned to collect witnesses,\u201d Petra said, looking at the cat with affection and a smidgeon of terror because it is disorienting when your familiar begins to do the work of small archivists unasked.\n\nThe second invitation arrived in a fashion that introduced itself as polite and proved otherwise. There was no wax this time and no seal, only a note that had carried through so many rooms to reach her that it had become a traveller. It smelled of train stations and a cologne that wants to be a poem. The paper asked her presence at a gathering of the association hinted at in the tracing, in a hall whose address was given as the place where once men had sold three types of rope and an argument to go with each. It promised that if she came, she would be allowed to ask one question and to answer none. It warned, with a kind of courtliness that scratched at the skin, that if she refused, a question would be sent to her house anyway and would insist on being answered by the things there that could not claim professionalism.\n\nMagda put the note down and picked up the folio again and then put both away because objects sometimes conspire if you leave them touching. She walked to the window and watched a bicycle decide bravely to be a vehicle even in snow that had ripened into slush. She was not in the habit of going into rooms that had a surplus of tweed and a deficit of sunlight. She understood that if she refused, the thing would not end but would come knocking like anything that wants to make you declare that you do or do not belong. She was able to admit to herself without drama that she had always been supple to invitations and extra resistant to summons.\n\nPetra stood and stretched and rolled her shoulders as if warming up to carry somebody else\u2019s mistake. \u201cIf you go,\u201d she said, \u201cI will walk you there without walking into the room. I will count the steps to the doorway and memorize them. I will plant coins in the street along the way for luck, which you will pretend to find casually. I will hang my coat on the nearest lion carved out of something complicated and ask it to watch for changes in your face when you come out.\u201d She laid her large hands out on the table and pressed her palms to the wood that had officiated and decided that if anyone in that hall put their hand where it didn\u2019t belong, the hall itself would have second thoughts. \u201cIf you do not go, there will be an envelope arrived at a terrible time and a bread you are baking will fall.\u201d\n\nThe cat had opinions but had decided to package them in a shape that would not immediately make anyone leave the room. It jumped into Magda\u2019s lap, turned itself into a loop of warm fur the exact geometry of eight, and purred off-key until the decision changed tone. The sound reached a place in Magda\u2019s chest that made her think of being thirteen again and telling herself rules with salt and coins and the number of steps on a bridge. She knew that she would go because the way the letter was written had annoyed her into curiosity, and curiosity, when poked, repays the bother by carrying you into rooms where history keeps its old toothbrush in a glass by the sink.\n\nThe hall, when they reached it, was in disguise the way old buildings are when they wish to be polite to those who\u2019ve come to scrape their money against a counter and go away with rope and disputation. The front had been painted the shade of neutrality that permits a shop to sell both paint thinner and advice, and only the door-knocker, an iron fish mid-sulk, betrayed the house\u2019s appetite. Petra set coins in the cracks between stones with such casual artistry that three pigeons made approving noises. She counted the steps not to the door but to the nearest shadow big enough to hide a regret in. Magda knocked the way you knock when you are inviting yourself to confess.\n\nInside it smelled like dust that had chosen friends among books instead of floors, and like wine that had been opened in the afternoon by someone thinking about the pace of their own heartbeat. The room had three long tables and many chairs and a clerk with a chin like a plinth. The association had assembled themselves in the clothes they wear when they know they may be asked to stand and be admired while pretending not to mind the draft. Rings gleamed in good taste and in lack of it. A woman with a scar along her eyebrow the shape of a scythe leaned against a radiator with the warmth of a person who arranges temperatures for a living. A man in a sweater with elbow patches the exact tone of his skepticism unfolded his arms and refolded them in a way that gave the impression of generosity without requiring him to offer it.\n\nThey greeted her by not greeting her, which is the manner of groups that prefer to watch you take your first steps on their floor and judge whether or not you are likely to embarrass their rug. She decided to be rude in a way that is perceived, in certain circles, as elegance. She nodded to the clerk as if they shared a private misgiving about the invoices, touched the radiator as if introducing the bones in her hands to its iron, and then looked neither left nor right but at the ceiling, because ceilings in such rooms hold more honest opinions than the painting does. The ceiling was cracked the way skin cracks in winter and then pretends it is fine in spring, and it had patched itself with careful attention, which meant someone here was capable of maintenance without fanfare.\n\nThe arithmetic pilgrim was absent and present both. Her name was not said and not permitted, and somehow every absence in the room arranged itself as if keeping a chair free for a person who had already decided whether to sit. The clerk gave Magda a token shaped like a drop of water and told her she could ask one question of place and not of person and that if she asked the wrong one the place would call it wrong by arranging everyone\u2019s coughs into a verdict. He added, with an amusement that fit his chin, that if she attempted to leave without partaking of their bread and their overly earnest cheese, the door would seize up and require a mechanic with intentions.\n\nShe considered the room and where it had learned to stand, considered the floorboards and the years that had taught them to remain unbroken when men in boots or women in newly-heel-bearing shoes marched in with law extending just behind them like a pale. She had half a mind to ask the table what had been signed on it that should not have been, and the other half to ask the radiator what it had overheard about water and fire. Instead she breathed and did what she had taught herself to do in kitchens and cabins: she asked the room what question would make it feel that it had been treated like a person and not a stage.\n\n\u201cWhat would you like me to ask,\u201d she said softly, letting the words use the parts of her mouth that most like soup. \u201cAnd what are you tired of hearing. And what, if answered, would make you permit this association to claim that they have a right, however temporary, to whisper?\u201d The clerk smiled not displeased. The elbow-patched man arranged his face to conceal his intimacy with the concept of relief. The woman by the radiator watched her fingers as if admiring the uncomplaining competence of tendons. The room answered in the airy voice of plaster and like all old houses it added a complaint because complaining is a right earned by seeing too much.\n\n\u201cAsk if they are willing to pay in silence,\u201d it said, and its words, though not lawyerly, had the careful structure of someone who has been talked over and has decided to pull out a different chair. \u201cAsk whether they will give you a season in which they do not ask and only allow the city to ask them to be kind. Ask them whether they will leave one corner empty in all their rooms where a person who does not like questions can hide and not be smoked out. Ask whether they are as good at receiving as they are at prying.\u201d The ceiling cracked its knuckles in satisfaction as if it had finally been invited to its own party. The radiator approved by not hissing, which is as loud as radiators get when expressing contentment.\n\nMagda turned to the assembled and asked the room\u2019s question because intermediaries have their obligations too. The association, caught unready by being asked to consider and not to promise cunning things, looked at one another and, like all organisms that wish to survive, made a plan so fast that plan looked like character. The clerk cleared his throat and did not perform: he said that yes, they would say nothing for a season and see if a different skill, one less applauded, did in fact exist in them. The man with elbow patches looked pained and agreed with his eyebrows. The woman by the radiator nodded, the nod of someone conjugating a verb she had been avoiding. Someone in the back whispered that the mildew penalty for naming had been effective and perhaps should be expanded to include insulting particular benches, and the room downstairs, which had a bench with pride but not vanity, twitched its leg in warning.\n\nThey offered her the bread and the cheese as threatened. She ate both politely. They poured her wine that had wanted to be better but had learned pragmatism and that grape\u2019s particular humility. The clerk gave her a paper like a recipe that set down the season of silence and the empty corner rule and an address to which she could send any small gods found in jars on Thursdays. Then, because she had accepted their bread, she did as courtesy demanded and asked them for a single thing in return that would not reveal hunger but would remind their bodies later that their mouths had been honest. She asked for the map of those who kept the ring with the fishhook close, not their names or their domiciles, because names and addresses are for police and letter carriers, but the pattern of what places they preferred, what weather they coveted, and at what hour they liked to commit their questions to paper. The clerk, who liked accurate maps more than most, glanced at the ceiling, which cracked once in approval, and said yes.\n\nOutside, Petra exhaled the temperature of the visitor\u2019s hall and pushed a coin with her boot into a crack that had not been there when they arrived. \u201cYou were long but not too long,\u201d she said, which amounted to a public laurel in her register. \u201cThe lion says five men pretended not to know how to lean, and two women pretended not to notice them pretending. There is a man in the third-story window across the street who is very good at reading backward and has been reading a book that was not written in that order. I told him to mind his business with my eyebrows.\u201d\n\nThey walked toward the canal because the canal thinks better of people who use it to wash thoughts rather than to shove them from one bank to another. Snow had given up its career ambitions for the week and fallen back into being weather; it gathered respectfully along the railings and avoided accusing pedestrians of insufficient romance. On the bridge, a boy threw a handful of something into the air and watched as it became not enough confetti and too much dust. He looked at Magda with the specific gravity assigned to adults who sometimes know the secret rules and said that he had seen her on a thing and then had watched a kettle and discovered that kettles were not merely appliances but instruments. She thanked him in a language that does not make boys feel managed, and he nodded, satisfied to have been recognized by a correct vowel.\n\nHer kitchen looked at her when she returned the way kitchens do when you bring in too many stories: it assessed the load-bearing capacity of the table and suggested a stew. Petra hung her coat and announced that she would nap for forty minutes like a soldier and be woken with cruelty in case the city wanted to run again. The cat, having successfully pilfered another button from somewhere no one would admit to, hid it behind the sugar, which pretended not to notice even while cataloguing the weight and the scratch. A small flyer had come under the door advertising a new thing: a man at the market was selling black sweets molded in the shape of a question mark fish, dusted with sugar so they looked like they had been dredged through a conversation. The price was affordable, which meant there was a plan to make back the loss on something else, and Magda smiled because the city had already begun metabolizing the spectacle into treats and trinkets. That was better than it being turned into doctrine, which makes bad bread and worse neighbors.\n\nNight came and brought with it neither dread nor rest, something in-between that Magda had learned to inventory without impatience. She turned the clocks to face out again because she had guests coming tomorrow and guests feel untrusted when time is told to avert its gaze. She wrote two invoices and threw them away because she had used too much righteousness in the phrasing; then she wrote them again in the voice of a person who knows that payment is not the same as gratitude and that insisting otherwise ruins soup. She set aside a place on a shelf for the jar the technicians would bring if they found spirits inside her outlets, and she spoke aloud to the outlets because electrical entities prefer to be addressed before they are inspected. She told them that if they had sheltered any stray whispers out of pity for a threadbare argument, now was the time to send them into the stairwell to choose different doors.\n\nShe slept at last, not the sleep of the unbothered but one of those municipal rests you get when a city has promised you that, for a few hours, it will keep your name out of papers and your streetlamp lit. In her dream she took the tram to the end of the line and discovered that the last stop was an enormous pot placed on a square in which onions browned to applause. She woke to the cat kneading her shoulder with intent that was affectionate and legislative, and to the sound of a trolley somewhere being asked to apologize by a track. She brewed coffee because tea is for mending, and this morning was for soldering. She set out cups because people would come and ask her to be precise without being sharp, and she could do that for the length of this winter and the width of this table and not longer.\n\nThe bell rang once and did not ring a second time. No one stood in the doorway when she opened it, which did not make her suspicious because absence is this city\u2019s most practiced trick. On the mat lay a small box wrapped in paper democratic enough to have contained meat or poetry. She brought it inside, checked it for municipal rats and divine sarcasm, found none, and unwrapped it with the care you give a gift from someone who does not know yet whether to apologize. Inside lay flour packed around an object wrapped again in cloth. She pulled back the cloth and found a loaf shaped like a question mark, proofed and baked with skill somewhere between old village hands and new city nerve. Under it there was a card with no name and three words written in a script she recognized at once because she had seen it move through lights like a snake learning to speak. The three words read: Next: your bridge.\n\nShe stared at the bread until its heat made the paper humble. She felt the hinge in her jaw where unkindness likes to hide click into place and then relax because she would not allow it space this morning. Bridge was not only a place in Vienna with a view and history; it was a thing you build to join shores that pretend to want distance. It was also a term in certain rooms for the interim between scenes when you allow the audience to breathe and then decide whether to clap or leave. She understood at once twelve meanings and knew there were thirty more. She understood that there would be a move to take the proceedings out of kitchens and out of wheels and onto the skin of the city\u2019s most public arches, where wind has opinions and pigeons possess rights. She understood that she would have to say yes if the invitation invoked something older than her refusal and that she would have to bring Petra because bridges, like kitchens, do not tolerate loneliness well.\n\nShe sliced the bread and smelled a joke braided into its crumb. It had been baked by someone who knew sugar is impolite in rye unless it is made to apologize with salt. She ate a piece and decided to keep the rest in case a bridge had a taste for symbolism later and could be bribed. She put the card with the three words on the high shelf because things above your line of sight have less power over your day than things below it. The cat jumped up and batted the card once and then let it be because even cats know that some games are better played with witnesses.\n\nPetra came in then, hair in a braid that had slept and woken more dignified than most people do. She saw the bread, read the three words, and made a face that in her dialect meant both we expected this and I was hoping for a different act. \u201cGood,\u201d she said, pouring coffee into cups that had long ago agreed to be identically chipped. \u201cLet her take the air and see if it will side with anyone who talks to it like a pet. I will bring rope and I will not tell you why until I need to.\u201d She sat and dunked her bread with the seriousness of a theologian practicing mischief. \u201cYou will wear a hat because bridges are vain and like it when their visitors dress for the occasion. And you will ask the city, at the top, to please between now and then avoid breaking any old men's hips, because bridges like to make their points in ways that make new widows, and I am tired of that drama.\u201d\n\nMagda nodded and felt the city turn its head toward them because it enjoys being asked to play fair when everyone expects it to be only romantic and cruel. She wrote a note to the office that watched the oath with two sentences that said six things; she sent Petra out to buy mustard because soup without mustard would make the day less honest; she ran a hand along the towel and thanked it for its lineage and asked it to tolerate more elbows. She did not say arithmetic or pilgrim or any proper names at all. She said bridge out loud because saying it taught her mouth how the air would feel when she stood where the invitation wanted her to stand. She believed, because belief is a traitor and a servant both, that place would not refuse her if she arrived hungry and wearing a hat that made a bridge feel taller. She put the bread on a plate because even jokes deserve to be served and not eaten from paper when they are trying to be metaphors, and she waited for the city to drop its next hint in the bowl by the door where coins and keys sleep between errands.",

                              "content": "Chapter 10\n\nThe day the bridge took up residence in her mouth began with sensible shoes and a superstition she thought she\u2019d retired. She dressed for the air as if it were a particular aunt\u2014affectionate, prone to comment, tender to hats\u2014and she set out with Petra to walk the city\u2019s spans the way you visit elders before making a decision that will obligate your knees. A notice from the office had been hand-delivered at dawn by a boy in municipal blue who had the look of a person dignified by errands; it stipulated that the officiant must be of sound footing, that the river be in a mood to listen, that railings be briefed against grandstanding, and that the amended clause about feeding witnesses be observed with sincerity and spoons that did not snap under moral weight. A stamp on the notice bore two arches with a small fishhook between them, which meant either someone had a sense of humor at City Hall or the association had discovered self-awareness and was trying it on.\n\nThey started with the small bridges over the canal because practice is kinder on modest architecture. Schwedenbr\u00fccke hunkered in its coat of traffic and steel like a person willing to be touched but not hugged; it tolerated questions the way bank clerks tolerate the lunch hour. Augartenbr\u00fccke was easier; it breathed and remembered lovers who had made of its midspan a private pronoun and children who had dropped marbles into the water to see whether the river spoke the language of games. Friedensbr\u00fccke, when they reached it, looked at Magda the way old friends look at you when they are practicing not saying I told you so. It had known her feet once when she had believed that counting could keep death polite, and it did not hold the belief against her. It had a broad back and a practical soul, which is an underrated quality in officiants.\n\n\u201cYours,\u201d Petra said, not because the bridge had put out a mat with her name on it but because the air took that particular texture people acquire when they have made room for a person to be braver than yesterday. There were stains on the girders shaped like the handprints of weather; there were pigeons in their correct number, neither too many to invite contempt nor too few to worry priests. The water below behaved; it had been sullen lately, winter having made it heavy, but today it had the resigned efficiency of a waiter in a caf\u00e9 where the coffee is never sent back. Magda set her palm against the parapet and felt the same small slow thrum she remembered from when she was thirteen and her bones were new to a city that believed in its own spine.\n\nThe office brought its devices and courtesies at noon. The inspector with the spoon, now a minor celebrity in his own circles, set a bowl against the wind and forced it to respect the old experiment; the spoon did not even twitch when the first dumb question was asked over the canal by a clerk practicing for television, which made two men in hi-vis jackets beam like uncles. A woman with a coil of bright rope and a notebook came to measure everything that might be measured and marked out a rectangle of witness on the east side where the light would not insult cameras into making art. She listened gravely when Petra asked for anchor points and then watched with professional interest as Petra looped her rope around a lamppost and a parapet as if she were teaching the bridge a knot that a boat would approve of without becoming sentimental. A placard went up at the north approach, drawing its authority from the kind of font that assures you doctors are involved: Oath of Contest, Domestic Amendment in Effect, Officiant: Friedensbr\u00fccke, Witnesses Must Be Available for Soup.\n\nWord had spread without anyone having to push it. In Vienna rumors commute for free and often arrive before you do with your bag. By midafternoon women with strong handbags and men with ordinary minds and clever children had begun to pause, calculate the probable time of the spectacle, and make shopping lists accordingly. Bruno, clutching an offensively small notebook and wearing a respectably subdued hat, tried to insinuate himself into the crew by claiming his great-uncle had once oiled a bolt on the same span, then thought better of it when Petra folded her arms and let her hands communicate, without recourse to verbs, the shape of the fee for men with notebooks. The clipboard woman appeared like a grant come in under budget, hair braided with duty, and reviewed the tape marked along the pavement as if it were a new policy on rights-of-way and not a gesture of prudence towards a bridge with a sense of its own dignity.\n\nThe arithmetic pilgrim sent no envelope this time because addresses had become superfluous; still, just before four, a car that enjoyed thinking of itself as a carriage arrived, and she disembarked with the economy of a person who knows that stairs pay attention. Her coat had learned the art of not being an event; it worried the edges of its own elegance but did not apologize, and her thumb ring made its narrow address on her hand like a commentary you cannot disagree with without looking petty. She took in the rope, the soup cauldrons\u2014two, braced on gas rings lugged up from the kitchen by a crew who had decided to enjoy being useful today\u2014the bowl and spoon, the municipal faces, the river. She smiled into the air with the minimum of teeth necessary to say: I see you seeing me; give me a second to make you comfortable with that fact.\n\n\u201cI have brought no wire,\u201d she said, pitching the line to carry to the places that matter\u2014the operator standing half-disguised behind a kiosk, the clipboard, the inspector, the bridge\u2014and three pigeons made skeptical noises in unison because pigeons believe in evidence, not promises. Her crew followed behind with less arrogance than last night, subdued by something that had not been part of any training-day module: the knowledge of being permitted on sufferance by a thing with rivets. The camera lowered its head like a penitent altar boy and blinked at the water with an expression that could be read as humility if you had learned how to ascribe virtue to machines.\n\n\u201cHat,\u201d Petra said softly, and Magda, who had chosen hers at noon with the seriousness of someone choosing a tone, put it on. It was sensible but not hostile to compliments, with a small ribbon whose behavior could be described as moral. The wind considered it on her and agreed not to make trouble unless she was rude. She adjusted the brim, set the ladle where it could do its duty with some flourish, and stepped to the chalk line that had been laid down between two patches of salt as if the city were making a recipe it refused to write down.\n\nWhen the hour came, it did not announce itself with bells so much as with a tightening in the air common to theatres and courts and kitchens where apologies are about to be offered. People arranged their faces into expressions they believed would be flattering in the memories of others; children corrected them. The inspector tested the silence a final time and nodded to the bridge the way you nod to someone you have agreed to call by their first name for the duration of a project. The bridge hummed once, a sound you could feel in your ankles more than your ears, and the camera flinched, which endeared it to three electricians and one saint.\n\n\u201cDeclare span,\u201d the bridge said, speaking through its iron and concrete, every stress line suddenly a throat. The voice had that quality old metal has in winter\u2014warmed by the friction of weather, slowed by thought. \u201cDeclare footings. Declare weight allowable without damage to dignity.\u201d The officiant had no time for nonsense, but its tolerance for ordinary human attempts made of those present an assembly of the correct size. Magda was grateful all at once for having learned to be polite to stairs as a child; bridges, like stairs, can be asked to be kind if you remember they are not there for you.\n\n\u201cNorth to south,\u201d she said, \u201cwith room for waste and the trumpet of impatience. Footings in the facts men poured in good moods and bad. Weight to include velvet and the way people pretend not to look when lovers fight.\u201d She let the grammar wear its boots. The arithmetic pilgrim, without attempting to improve on it, added her declaratives as if offering the officiant a bouquet without the embarrassment of flowers. \u201cFrom the city that calls itself first to the one that acts like it,\u201d she said, naming the districts in the old way that counts bridges as a kind of jewelry. \u201cFootings in losses we agreed to forget. Weight to include ratings, friction, and the privilege of having come farther than anyone expected.\u201d\n\nThe bridge accepted both, as though its ledger had a column labeled generosity. The camera\u2019s light moved from green to a meek red, and the inspector\u2019s spoon stayed polite. The river decided not to show off with a floating branch performing dramatics. The voice that had held the quiz show together arrived late, as if having run from an appointment, and tried to sound as if it had always lived in girders; it did a respectable job for something that had been designed to sell adverts between competition and haircut. \u201cContest resumes,\u201d it said, reading off a sheet that had been dampened by the weather and hardened by policy. \u201cOfficiant: Friedensbr\u00fccke. Scope public and elevated. Wire denied. Audience disarmed of sharp derision and permitted warm commentary. Witnesses to be fed first. Petitioners to speak as issued.\u201d\n\nMagda knew the bridge would not want theatrics dressed as questions. This was a place that preferred practical confessions to prettified lies, surefooted nouns to the kind of adjectives that make boys write songs. She felt the thrum under her hand with the exactness of a metronome that has been influenced by love. The first question rose not from the ceiling of a cabin this time but from the river itself, which is the city\u2019s memory cooled into a habit. \u201cWhat did counting do,\u201d it asked, and the water slapped the pier in a rhythm that was almost kind to memory. \u201cWhen you put numbers between yourself and sorrow, what did you build. Did the bridge help.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made time put its foot precisely and refrain from running,\u201d she said, and the answer was neither elegant nor hungry, which pleased the air. \u201cIt gave me something to tell my bones to do that wasn\u2019t thinking about lemon and the thing the disinfectant couldn\u2019t cover. It did not help my mother stay; it helped me not to drop. The bridge offered me an honest surface and the dignity of a tangent. It tolerated my small arithmetic without adjusting its own and I am grateful to it, which is not the same as saying I was right.\u201d\n\nThe arithmetic pilgrim listened in a manner more interesting than her practiced attentiveness; she did not tap her ring, and her eyes did not travel left for forbidden aid. The wind put a flat palm on her mouth as if to test whether it would be a friend to her voice. \u201cCounting makes a promise to your pride,\u201d she said, speaking to the river and to every city that had trained itself to pretend it can be measured without flattery. \u201cIt says you will not be caught unawares by the same drop twice. It\u2019s theatre you do for yourself that sometimes keeps you from looking down. I did not count. I learned to skip, and I lost things. I lost things and told myself the loss was speed.\u201d\n\nThe bridge liked the honesty of it in a way that admits bias; spans are constructed by people who trust numbers enough to risk poetry. The second question came in the voice of iron: \u201cDefine toll, in a century that has learned to pay without putting coins on a table.\u201d It was an ancient word bristling with modern teeth. The ring of witnesses sharpened their faces, and Petra, who could have answered in three dialects and a curse, rested her weight on both feet as if preparing to carry whatever came next.\n\n\u201cA toll is the price of not drowning,\u201d Magda said, because she had left fancy in the kitchen on purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s the bit you owe the thing that bears you, even if you pretend it owes you. It can be money, or it can be the promise to leave something on the far side that you picked up on the near, because not everything loves being carried. It is also a story you tell the ones behind you about the wind up here, so they come ready. In courts it is called court fees. In kitchens it is called washing up.\u201d She let herself smile, and three men nearby felt themselves become less ridiculous for having brought thermoses.\n\n\u201cThe toll is audience,\u201d the pilgrim said, and because she had chosen that as her instrument she paid in her own coin without apology. \u201cI cross because people hope to see me cross, and their hope makes the span less long. The price is I must go back and forth more times than I would if no one watched. The price is to be always observed and thus never unmade.\u201d She said it like a ledger entry, and the bridge, which had ledger in its bones and remembered every footstep like a numerator, allowed itself to be persuaded that audience could be a legitimate currency if not the only clean one.\n\nThe third question, as old as bridges and as new as paperless tickets, came from the underside, from the steel that only birds and vagrants look at. \u201cWhat will you refuse to carry across,\u201d it asked, and a train in the distance added its long opinion to the air. Magda thought of what she had seen dragged from bank to bank by people who believed distance fixed virtue. She thought of gossip disguised as mercy and mercy disguised as pity and pity disguised as a knife.\n\n\u201cCruelty that is proud of itself,\u201d she said. \u201cWeapons that have been disguised as etiquette. Promises that have been hollowed by practice. I will not carry proofs of other people\u2019s disappointments across as if they were trophies, and I will not carry my own righteousness when it is bigger than my hunger. I will carry sadness because it does not know better, and I will carry boredom because sometimes it is a virtue. I will not carry a wire, even if asked, even if told it is the modern way to cross.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegret performed for effect,\u201d the pilgrim said, and you could tell she had had to teach herself the difference between regret and rehearsal. \u201cSelf-pity in good clothes. Lies that improve ratings and break floors. The particular kind of contempt that is taught in certain rooms where men practice winning without eating afterward with the people they beat.\u201d She had chosen her refusals with care, and the crowd, which had learned this winter the taste of admission, found themselves willing to be moved by someone who had also been briefly willing to be small.\n\nA motion by the parapet, small enough to be plausibly accidental, made Petra\u2019s rope hand twitch. A young man with a device the color of indifference had been inviting a whisper to climb his sleeve; it hummed with that dry signature Magda had learned to hear in rooms that pretend to be silent. Before the inspector could be offended or the clipboard can pronounce the word violation with relish, the wind took a sudden interest in a flap of paper attached to the device. Petra did not make a scene, because scenes give wire confidence; she stepped as if retrieving a chestnut from an unwise pigeon and lifted the rope in a way that moved the young man and his hum and their hopes two meters south into a region where the city\u2019s superstition about unlucky numbers held jurisdiction. The hum met a cross-current, panicked, and slipped into the river with a small spark that the water politely ignored. The inspector marked something on a form with a line that suggested gratitude, and Magda sent some of hers down the rope into Petra\u2019s palm.\n\nIt was the bridge\u2019s turn to ask a local question, something in the way of house rules. \u201cFoot traffic has a right-of-way when weather and fear conspire to make running likely,\u201d it said, quoting its own private ordinance compiled from a hundred years of breath. \u201cUnder the amended clause, witnesses must be fed. Who feeds the bridge.\u201d It was not an accusation; it was a practical inquiry from a host who had learned belatedly to enjoy being thanked.\n\n\u201cWe feed you with names you are allowed to keep,\u201d Magda said. \u201cWith palms that carry warmth across. With the small humor of hats. With steps that touch and do not strike. With soup steam, if you consent. With the habit of saying thank you to the railings in winter without telling anyone we did it.\u201d She glanced at the cauldrons, where Petra and a girl from a bakery who had appointed herself spoon-handle-guardian were managing the delicacies of hot things near politics. They had chosen a soup with good intentions and better salt, and it was the kind of broth that makes witnesses respectable even when their opinions lean untidy.\n\n\u201cWith attention,\u201d the pilgrim said, and this time she kept it modest. \u201cBridge-feeding is attendance without appropriation. It is taking a photograph and not showing it to anyone. It is telling small boys to stop carving obscenities in the paint because there are better walls for that, and then writing the obscenity yourself in a place that knows how to forgive.\u201d There was laughter, not cruel, and the river made a noise like the part of applause that is for yourself.\n\nThe officiant liked it, and because it liked it, the fourth question allowed itself to be the kind that leaves a mark without obvious handwriting. \u201cWhich shore do you live on,\u201d it asked both of them without making a joke of metaphor, \u201cand what tax do you pay to go home.\u201d It was always a dirty secret of bridges that they favor one bank; the honest ones admit it, the splendid ones deny it, the useful ones shrug and do their work. Magda looked downriver to where the canal pretended it was river and then to the buildings behind her with their domestic faces and their windows that had learned her name without asking permission.\n\n\u201cWhichever shore has the kitchen I\u2019ve promised to return to,\u201d she said, and she felt the word kitchen do its new work in the air like a saint promoted reluctantly. \u201cIf I am honest, it is not the bank with more lights. It is the one where the ground knows the grammar of my step. The tax is that I must come back the long way sometimes when I have said something too sharp, and the bridge charges me in humility. I pay it because it keeps the wood in my apartment from drying out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI live on the shore with the crowd,\u201d the pilgrim said, and there was no self-loathing in it, only the cool clarity of a person who has learned what she is permitted to love. \u201cI pay by sleeping badly, by losing the names of dogs, by forgetting to bring change, by keeping my hands gentle longer than I would if no one watched.\u201d That last admission hung there between them like a piece of fruit neither wanted to claim and neither would drop, and the bridge, which has little patience for coyness, cleared its iron throat and threw them a reprieve in the form of a procedural.\n\nThe voice of the office, damp and chastened, reminded them that under the arc clause each party could ask one question of the water without it counting against the other\u2019s breath. Magda asked first because generosity is craft as well as courtesy and some crafts require precedence to matter. \u201cWhat have you refused,\u201d she said to the river, remembering an August years ago when it had turned its back on three boys pushing a supermarket trolley out toward the middle. \u201cWhat have you insisted on carrying to the sea even when the city begged you to give it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cNames,\u201d the water said, and the wind folded in respectfully because even air can be taught to behave when grief begins to inflate. \u201cI refuse to keep names that have been shouted at me; I carry them away no matter how much stone holds on. I keep the names breathed instead. Those I keep long enough for the fish to learn and the mud to memorize. I declined a bicycle that believed it was a crown. I returned a crown that wanted to be a bicycle. I have kept three songs because no one had the courage to sing them aloud on land, and a city must have a secret or it turns to glass.\u201d\n\nThe pilgrim asked the water a question that was both clever and true, which is a dangerous combination when the officiant is a structure with a conscience. \u201cHow do you measure audience,\u201d she asked, and the musicians gathered under the western arch who had hoped for a moment did grin at the precision of it. \u201cNot in counts,\u201d she added, as if to reassure Magda that she understood the rules of this place and that her old instruments had learned to tune themselves for nights like this. \u201cBut in weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the sway of birds and the way cigarette smoke hangs or hurries,\u201d the water said. \u201cBy whether children hush each other or no one can tolerate hush. By how long the bread thrown to ducks admits its error and dissolves into humility. By the weight of winter coats on railings and the conversations they remember. By whether the bridge feels heavier when you leave than when you came.\u201d The bridge hummed assent, because it is a joy to be translated into a form the city can comprehend without swallowing, and the inspector made one last flourish with his pen because he was remembering how to distrust the wire without embarrassment.\n\nThe ritual piece\u2014names of productions, numbering of minutes, reminding of penalties\u2014came next because even amended ceremonies must maintain a minimal decency. The clipboard read from her pristine, new-shortened form that neither party had said the other\u2019s name out loud, which meant everyone\u2019s chairs would be safe from mildew so long as no one got clever in an after-dinner speech. The office praised the rope for its cooperation and asked gently that it might be allowed to retire before someone built a story around it. Petra complied with a flourish that made three teenagers decide to learn knots for reasons other than romance, and the rope coiled itself with the kind of elegance that suggests all good tools know when they have been precisely used.\n\n\u201cInstrument,\u201d said the bridge, not so much out of a need to hear a confession as out of the pedagogical desire to see if a lesson had stuck. The audience made a little sound because repetition feels like belonging, and the soup chose that moment to reach a perfect simmer, a domestic amen that made the whole span smell briefly like a decision you are proud of. The pilgrim raised her hand in a motion that looked like surrender and was not. \u201cAudience, as declared,\u201d she said, and the bridge refused to sneer at it because it had seen armies and parades and lovers; it knew that sometimes being watched keeps you from falling. Magda laid her palm on the stone and said \u201cplace\u201d again with the extra gravity that comes when you are repeating something to make it true rather than interesting, and both the stone and the sound conceded the legitimacy of her choice.\n\nThere was one more thing the officiant required, because bridges do not like to be left in the state of anticipation that roads prefer. \u201cAdmit danger,\u201d it said, and horses stamped somewhere not present because they heard their word called. \u201cNot to each other. To the city.\u201d This was the question that divides pageants from rites. The men with thermoses sipped as if coffee could be a moral position, and the children stilled with an attention that had nothing to do with parents\u2019 hands on collars.\n\n\u201cIf we keep doing this wrong,\u201d Magda said, and she felt the hat approve of her posture, \u201cwe will teach the city to clap at the wrong time. We will teach it to prefer cleverness to repair, theatre to stairs. We will break the habit of ordinary chairs being enough. We will invite pretty laws to dine with brutal ones and the polite knives will learn the names of throats. If we do it right, we might build a grammar for rooms that have been waiting centuries to be allowed to speak without being called sentimental. The danger is becoming good at the wrong magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we keep doing this wrong,\u201d the pilgrim said in a voice for once plain as unmagicked bread, \u201cI will become so adept at being watched that I will forget how to stop. The city will forget how to be interesting when no one is filming it. We will build a market for a thing that ought to be a sacrament, and the market will eat it as markets do. The danger is we make a bridge out of knives again and then have the nerve to complain about blood.\u201d She looked at Magda when she said it with a species of warmth that resembled respect and might just have been professional greed, which is a cousin of it.\n\nThe verdict, when it came, did not do the thing verdicts usually do. It did not assign a winner that could be tallied, monetized, sold later in sugar, or tattooed on a forum\u2019s masthead. It took the shape of instructions with teeth, and the teeth were small enough to get between the fibers of everyday life, which is where policy lives if it intends to survive. \u201cContest is complete,\u201d said the bridge, and the north wind run its fingers through pigeon feathers with approval. \u201cPetitioner releases one edge of the compass to place when place insists. Respondent declares publicly that fair and kind are different but compatible and will not be used as each other\u2019s alibis. Both will feed witnesses at future spectacles and not let hunger be an aesthetic. Wires will be treated as guests and made to wait outside with the coats. City will reserve the right to refuse fun if it endangers chairs. Names remain unsaid in public for the length of a winter and the angle of this hat.\u201d\n\nA ripple went through the crowd that felt like gratitude calming a muscle. The inspector wrote \u201ccomplete\u201d in a box that had waited patient months to be filled and then underlined it because men who marry spoons become romantic about outcomes in the correct way. The clipboard woman allowed herself the rare pleasure of closing a file before her breath ended, which in her trade is usually a luxury reserved for deaths and elections. Petra ladled soup with the righteous exhaustion of a priest after a successful holiday, and when someone tried to clap too early she inclined her head at them with such precise disappointment that the clap resolved itself into a better-timed embrace of the air.\n\nThey ate. The pilgrim burned her tongue a little, which she bore with the composure of someone who has learned not to show the city her blister. The operator from the wheel accepted a bowl and stood where he could see both banks, which is the position men who do good work choose without advertisement. A boy fed bread to ducks and then apologized under his breath for the sugar in it, which is a scandal in water circles, and a duck forgave him by biting his bootlace instead of his finger. The river inhaled the warmth and kept its private count. A woman on crutches stayed for the whole thing and did not resent the cold because the bridge had remembered to dip, at the right moment, and make everyone feel tall.\n\n\u201cYou were not fair,\u201d Petra murmured to Magda later, when the span had resumed its ordinary job of letting people cheat at geography. \u201cAnd you were kind enough that children will be allowed to borrow your name when they argue with stairs. She was not kind, but she was fair enough that the city forgave her ring and will stop taking milk from her in caf\u00e9s twice on nine days out of ten. The bridge was itself, which is the real miracle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will write the office and thank them for remembering to be ashamed of wires,\u201d Magda said, and she felt the tide of dread that had been riding in her ribcage since the bread in the shape of a question had arrived recede to a level where you can walk without lifting your knees too high. \u201cAnd then I will go home and unteach the towels what applause sounds like. They got ideas last night and kept their edges out to be admired.\u201d\n\nThe arithmetic pilgrim approached with that clean step she had perfected for camera and court alike, and held out her hand the way you offer someone a lighter in the wind. They did not shake because sometimes that is a superstition and sometimes it is hygiene and sometimes it is mercy; they let their hands talk near each other like diplomats. \u201cNext,\u201d she said, and she said it without sugar and without injury. \u201cNot because of ratings. Because bridges are addictive and I would like to see what a street with a market knows. I will not bring wire. I will bring somebody who has never answered a question into a microphone and see if it improves or ruins them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext,\u201d Magda agreed, and she did not pretend the word lacked gravity. \u201cBecause the city likes to hear itself in different rooms. Because a market has a grammar that has taught more people manners than any school. Because I have a debt to a baker who told my fortune once with crumbs.\u201d They stood there very briefly in a place where compromises were honest, and then the pilgrim turned away with the unkind grace of someone who has taught motion to keep her from growing a conscience, and Magda turned homeward with Petra at her side, which is how courage has survived the winter so far.\n\nThe cat met them three streets from the bridge with a disdainful efficiency that suggested it had been out all afternoon filing reports with the small gods. It had acquired a ticket stub that said in a dead language: for standing where the air is thinner and not pretending to be taller, and it dropped it at Petra\u2019s feet as if to implicate her in elegance. At home, the kitchen performed its trick of smelling like soup even after the spoons had been washed, which is a little-known miracle separate from onions entirely. The towel, well pleased with its new clerical status, had been left a note by the inspector written with the municipal courtesy of a person who prefers to compliment cloth in private: Thank you for officiating in absentia. It had a stamp with two arches and a fishhook and an apology for the starch.\n\nLetters multiplied like a kind of respectable fungus on the mat by morning. One was from the association with a map made in good faith showing where those who wore the fishhook ring liked to stand, and at what hours their questions bit. The pattern was less elegant than prophecy and more practical than menace; it had clusters around courtyards and tram stops, and three dots along the market street Petra had mentioned which suggested the next place would be loud in a human way. Another letter came with the city stamp upside down, which could be read as whimsy or haste; it contained a gentle request that Magda consider making a list of chairs that had suffered under the amended clause\u2019s attention, to be repaired at public expense because people had begun to carry their sorrow into kitchens, and sorrow sits too heavily for cheap wood.\n\nShe made tea because coffee had acquired too many approvals in the last twenty-four hours and deserved a rest. Petra sprawled in the chair the cat had been saving for her and announced that she would steal for the market event three aprons from the theatre museum under a pretense that made art exact its tithe from politics. Magda counted spoons and discovered, with a privately pleased little gasp, that one had learned restraint; if shaken it did not try to answer. She considered the bridge, which had taken their talk and converted it to policy the way stomachs turn soup into blood. She considered the pilgrim, who had discovered late a habit of not cheating and might find it to her taste. She considered the city, which had begun to enjoy being addressed at last in sentences with verbs that did not threaten to take your coat.\n\nAt noon, the boy from the office with the honorable shoulders returned with a brand-new form\u2014Market Clause, addendum to the domestic and elevated provisions\u2014and a wad of blue tape. It said that stalls are officiants if asked in chorus, that haggling counts as precedent but not law, that card tables have no jurisdiction unless they have been blessed by fruit, and that under no circumstances may a chicken be cross-examined without consent. The penalty for premature clapping would be revised to include the sudden proliferation of coriander in unsuitable dishes. The boy read this aloud with straight face and handed over the tape with grave palms, and Petra, not able to help herself, saluted the tape as if it had just been promoted.\n\nThat night, because endings are for festivals and this winter had decided on continuations, Magda sat at the table with the folio of tracings of old D\u2019s and wrote in the margins where her teacher\u2019s neat hand had once refused academies their comfort. She recorded that the bridge had insisted on tolls in soup and mercy instead of coin and swagger, and that the air had behaved. She wrote that the city had enjoyed itself without destroying furniture, and that sometimes this is what religion looks like for people who no longer like altars but still need things that require washing up. She put down that audience can be an instrument if tuned by shame and that place, when given a job, does it honestly and resentful only if you forget to let it nap.\n\nThe cat, apostolic in its certainty that nothing serious happens that does not eventually impinge upon bowls, took up residence on the shelf where the new jars for spirits would sit, as if to bless in advance the future hauntings. Petra fell asleep on the couch with a roll of tape in her fist and the rope coiled by the door as if it had decided to become a pet. The market would make a noise tomorrow and pretend to be a thunderstorm, and someone would ask a question that made a chest of lemons confess to immortality. A bridge had stamped a decision on the day. A kitchen had rewritten one line of law by browning onions with discipline. The wheel, across town, spun once in the late wind and made a sound like a man remembering to apologize to a woman who had been right. And the city, turning under its winter hat, tried out a new habit in the mirror: listening, not for clapping or for footfall, but for the small syllables of places clearing their throats.",
