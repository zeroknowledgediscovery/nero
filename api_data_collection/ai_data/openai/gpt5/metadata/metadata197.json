     "novel_text": "The morning the photo hit all the feeds, Lark woke with the sound of a duck in her ear.\n\nNot an actual duck, but that wetly polite quack that sounds like a throat clearing. The kind that slides in under a door no matter how many pillows stack against it. She\u2019d been dreaming of them for weeks: heads down, green sheen on top, slow paddling little machines that carried more mystery than their waddle deserved. A beak turning. A bead of a black eye finding her from the reeds.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d she told the empty room, and then found her phone by sweeping the charger cord along the floor like a fisherman. The screen lit with the same picture over and over, re-shared, meme-ified, captioned a dozen ways, none of them generous. A paparazzi caught her at Swan Grove, the park in Studio City with the pond and the willow trees, except that day the swans had been outnumbered. Mallards had arrived in a green-headed gang. Lark\u2019s posture in the photo said everything: her shoulders up like rabbit ears, hand up to block, eyes wide, mouth in a small, round O, the way people make a small O before they scream in a movie. The nearest duck looked profoundly unconcerned. The headline said DUCK, LARK! Fear is a four-letter word if you write it as DUCK.\n\nHer agent texted four times before the coffee pot wheezed. Denise wrote the kind of everything-okay message that means nothing is okay without press management. The PR team suggested posting a video hugging a duck. The director of the film she was due to promote sent a shrug emoji that Lark read as: this again.\n\nShe didn\u2019t reply. She sat in the slick rental kitchen in the hills and drank coffee that tasted expensive and metallic. Her phone trembled alive on the counter, buzz buzz, like a fly against a screen. She turned it over. She covered it with a napkin. The quack came back anyway, like a thought you can\u2019t disinvite. She closed her eyes and felt a wild rush under her ribs, a flutter. People always said butterflies for nerves. Those felt too pretty. What lived inside Lark were frantic sparrows throwing themselves against glass.\n\nThe thing with the ducks wasn\u2019t new. It wasn\u2019t even unusual. If you were Lark Corwin and you had been nine in Westfield when your father married a woman with a stepdaughter and a backyard that touched the little municipal pond\u2014if you had been that person you too might remember the way the ducks would climb the slope in a polite row like they were walking into your kitchen to ask for tea. You\u2019d remember their tiny wet footprints. You\u2019d remember one of them turning its head toward you, the slow, low-feeling look that felt like a calculation. You\u2019d remember not trusting their quiet, and your new stepmother laughing and saying, Come on now, they\u2019re hungry, Lark, they\u2019re not assassins.\n\nShe became a movie star for a messy stew of reasons (she had the kind of face cameras like to drink, she had patience for long days, she was better than you would think at making chaos look intentional, and also luck, luck with a capital L that felt like someone else\u2019s game). The world was wide with lenses. So some things could hide. You could be terrified of the sight of a webbed foot and no one would know for eight years.\n\nDenise called. Lark picked up because it felt like not picking up was choosing a new kind of hell, the one where someone in a suit starts using the phrase \"noncompliance\" in a sentence.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a headline,\u201d Denise said, without hello, voice already running on the heel of a high shoe. \u201cIs it real? Tell me it\u2019s a bit. Tell me we can turn this. Tell me we can get a children\u2019s book out of it in eighteen months.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d Lark said. She tried to laugh then, as if by laughing she could frame it as a brand. You know me! Quirky fear of ducks! Movie star\u2014afraid of a backyard animal! Did you know? \u201cI don\u2019t think I can work with them anymore. Or near them. Or like, within the radius of a duck's thought.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin the radius of a duck\u2019s thought,\u201d Denise repeated, and sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re on Fallon Thursday. They\u2019re going to try to bring one out. You need to be able to handle plastic. If it\u2019s rubber we can talk. We can lean into rubber.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubber is worse. The eyes on those\u2026 they\u2019re fixed and they know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay this is spiraling. Listen. Post that shot of you feeding ducks when you were what, ten? People need continuity. Vintage content. Nostalgia gives them context. Then we do a few light interviews, you tell a funny story, we do a donation to some bird sanctuary, we make you an animal lover again who\u2019s just having a human moment, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never fed ducks. That picture is of June,\u201d Lark said, and swallowed the name because it felt like something unwrapped in a room full of strangers. June with her knees dirty, tossing crumbles from her palm, laughing in that way she always laughed when something lived in two states at once\u2014beautiful and ridiculous.\n\nThe call ended on a plan that sounded like a plan: a social post, a retort, a dress chosen that couldn\u2019t possibly read duck. Lark put the phone down. She wanted something that did not exist. She wanted, in a sudden old way, her hometown kitchen and the radio low, the tiled table, the sunlight off the pond, even the smell from the pond, which was part fish, part damp, part algae, part laundry dryer vent that wafted in from the house next door.\n\nHer driver was waiting in an app. Had been for twenty minutes. The little car on the map made jittery hesitant movements, like perhaps the driver had a duck of his own.\n\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d he said when she finally slid into the cool back seat, her baseball cap down and her sunglasses up. He clocked her in the way people do when they think they might know you later.\n\n\u201cWestfield,\u201d she said.\n\nHe glanced back. \u201cYou mean Westwood?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cWestfield. The one with the mall and the pond and the ice cream place that sells the weird lavender flavor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not around here,\u201d he said, carefully.\n\n\u201cNo. I know.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cLAX. Then... I\u2019ll get the rest.\u201d\n\nOn the plane, she read the same page of a magazine four times because the article on sustainable engineering kept breaking itself into the face of a mallard. She wrote a text to June, then deleted it. She wrote a text to her father that said \u201cComing home,\u201d and didn\u2019t send that either. The drink cart clanged past. The woman next to her tried to start a smiling war. Lark closed her eyes and made a movie in her head. In the movie she went to Westfield and nothing mattered as much as everyone said it did. In the movie, the world would forgive a person their biological brambles. In the movie, the pond would be frozen again, and she and June would skate on dull blades that cut soft white lines the shape of words you didn\u2019t want to say out loud yet.\n\nThe airport smelled like cinnamon and floor wax and nobody recognized her when she pulled up her hoodie. Westfield did not have a paparazzi economy. The taxi driver did not ask for a selfie. He asked if she had cash because the card reader did not like rain. It was not raining. Everyone in town talked like it might, though\u2014they looked up and mentioned the possibility as you handed them a five, as they bagged your bananas, as they told you it had been a wild week for the Hawks.\n\nHer father\u2019s house had a new paint color no one had prepped her for. It had been a quiet yellow in her mind; it was now some stoic gray that made the house look like it had been reading books about boundaries. The front garden had knows what it was doing. Ranks of lavender. A lemon tree. A small wind sculpture made of copper hands.\n\nWhen she walked in, she heard the kitchen radio sweetly tin and June explaining how to solder to someone over speaker.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late because you don\u2019t respect my time,\u201d June said. \u201cNo,\u201d she added, \u201cthat\u2019s me being dramatic. You\u2019re late because time is a circle and you live in a line. Left hand steady, okay? If you\u2019re going to blow up, don\u2019t do it in my face.\u201d\n\nJune didn\u2019t look surprised to see Lark in the doorway because June never looked surprised the way regular people did. She breathed in slowly, like painters step back to catch the whole of what they\u2019ve been working on. She was a little taller than Lark remembered, or maybe she just stood more decided. Her hair was cut blunt and practical, her hands were steady and shop-stained, and her shirt read ALL MY HEROES DIED AT MACH 26.\n\n\u201cCall me back,\u201d June said to her phone, and hung up. \u201cHey.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Lark said. And because homes have scripts, she added, \u201cYou cut your hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ran away from ducks,\u201d June said. Not unkind.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t run.\u201d Lark put her bag down. \u201cI\u2026 okay, I ran. You saw.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone saw,\u201d June said. \u201cWestfield might not have paparazzi, but we have the internet.\u201d\n\nThey hugged. The hug was familiar, even if everything else had gotten new edges. When they were younger, their hugs had been a message: we will do our best to invoke sisterhood even if our families were reorganized at the council of adults and then told to buzz like bees. Now it was its own thing. A small port city where weather didn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cYour room is as you left it,\u201d June said. \u201cWith the addition of an oscillating fan that sounds like an old man concerned about politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy old room.\u201d Lark smiled at the phrase, worn smooth from use. No one\u2019s room is as they left it. They had child selves that had moved out. Two steps into the hallway she understood that rule\u2014on the wall there was a framed magazine cover of Lark from two years ago, and opposite it there were three pencil sketches of cylinders with fins, and on the floor at the far end a basket of lemons, each with a little face drawn on in sharpie.\n\n\u201cYou drawing on fruit?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were asking for it,\u201d June said.\n\nTheir father came home with soil on his hands, the good kind. He made a Lark noise, which was a sound that had her name in it without needing the letters, a small delighted exhale, and then he stood there in his boots and waited like he had learned not to rush a person who had just crossed a distance. His second wife, Tamara, was in Santa Fe for a pottery intensive and sent a photo of a vase that looked like it had been built to be angry.\n\nThey ate something simple that did not have duck in it. People kept trying to be funny about that, Lark found, as if cruelty becomes less when you drape it in roasted orange slices. Her father asked her about the work, careful and kind. June asked nothing. June talked about materials. The kitchen filled with parts: the word for a curved section of a nose cone, the way to hold a file, the bland perfection of stainless steel when you want heat to have a place to go that is not critical.\n\n\u201cJust say it,\u201d Lark said finally, hand flat to the table. \u201cI\u2019m ridiculous. Say it. Everyone else is. The director said \u2018we can always CGI them out, sweetheart\u2019 to my face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re not ridiculous,\u201d June said. \u201cBut tell me what you think is my opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I should control it. That I should get over it. Exposure therapy. Like a video montage\u2014me feeding a duck, me hugging a duck, me acting with a duck named Winston.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not putting animals in a montage,\u201d June said. \u201cBut if we\u2019re doing honesty, it is inconvenient if your job wants ponds and your nervous system wants deserts.\u201d\n\nTheir father stirred his tea and said, \u201cDeserts have birds too. Sandpipers. Tall cranes. Buzzards. Very cinematic.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Lark said, and laughed despite herself, which hurt her ribs for some reason. \u201cIt is inconvenient. But calling it ridiculous doesn\u2019t make it less. It makes me feel like I\u2019m failing an exam that I didn\u2019t choose to take. Did you know ducks can sleep with one eye open? That they actually do that? How am I supposed to be out there doing soft smile eyes into a lens when some bird is half asleep and half seeing me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know other animals do stranger things,\u201d June said. \u201cSharks sleep while moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not comforting, June.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be,\u201d June said. \u201cThey keep going. That\u2019s the whole point of life. You keep going and if you have a fear you give it a seatbelt.\u201d\n\nShe said it like she believed it. Lark wanted to believe it too. Her father reached for the honey and missed, and nobody corrected him because he found it the second time anyway.\n\nThat night, in her old room that was now a guest room with her face on the wall, Lark lay under a quilt and let the sound of the pond come through the window screen. No matter how long she had been gone, Westfield sounded like itself. Freight trains that took forever. A teenager practicing drums across the street. The occasional car that made too much of a noise because some boy\u2019s father had left the world and the boy needed the engine to be a person for a while. She turned her phone face down. It did not know how to lie there quietly. It had to twitch, to remind. Then, because her brain was a grinning jerk, she started to count ducks instead of sheep.\n\nShe stood at the pond at dawn because the body remembers paths even when the mind doesn\u2019t approve of the destination. She\u2019d slipped out while everyone slept\u2014June on the couch covered in a schematic, her father still on the left side of the bed because even remarriages keep the map of the old house. The fog was like a careful old woman smoothing a scarf. A man with a dog nodded. The dog was small and named Pancake. Lark knew because the man said it to the dog twice, partly to tell her what the dog was called. It felt like the kind of morning when everything tries to be good.\n\nThen a duck saw her.\n\nOr she saw it. It had the spherical, indifferent head that a duck wore to breakfast. It turned. The low cold in her went on. She backed up. Her hands were up as if in a robbery. The duck was not interested. The ducks never were, that was the stupid part. The fear had nothing to do with their intention. The fear was a current under glass you only saw when it rippled the cup.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d asked a voice, which turned out to be attached to a boy who looked fourteen and had a skateboard and the world\u2019s most merciful eyebrows. Kids, she thought. The exact mercies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she lied. Then she tried again. \u201cNo. I\u2019m a little\u2026 weird about these birds.\u201d\n\n\u201cDucks?\u201d He said the word without malice. He set one wheel of the skateboard down, then took it back up. \u201cMy aunt\u2019s afraid of bananas,\u201d he offered. \u201cIt\u2019s like the curve. Makes her feel judged.\u201d\n\nLark laughed again and this time it didn\u2019t hurt. \u201cI might be afraid of their curve too.\u201d\n\nShe sipped air until the ducks gave her a gift and drifted away. She walked home past a flyer for a missing cat named Mouse. She tried to feel the ground. She tried to feel her feet.\n\nJune was in the garage when she got back, which wasn\u2019t a garage anymore but a laboratory made of porch fans, lists in chalk, and the far sweet smell of burnt metal. The door groaned. June didn\u2019t look up right away. Lark just watched. The two silver sections of something stood in the corner, upright, like a pair of bored Romans waiting to be sent to a war. Not two. One in halves.\n\n\u201cThis is the part where you tell me I\u2019m insane,\u201d June said, finally raising her head. \u201cBefore you do, remember you used to put on your mother\u2019s wedding dress and go to Dairy Queen for a dipped cone on the day summer began. We all have our calendars.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you building,\u201d Lark said, like she didn\u2019t know, because saying it out loud changes the gravity of a room.\n\n\u201cA rocket,\u201d June said. \u201cOr some language of a rocket, for now.\u201d\n\nLark laughed then and moved closer so she could take in the welds, the inset rings, the stiffeners, the way June\u2019s hands had learned softness around hardness. There were notes on the wall. Names like Hargrave. Words like bipropellant and delta-v and orbit, all spelled correctly in June\u2019s neat hand, as if that were what would change the fate of a body. Spelling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d June said. \u201cI mean, it is exactly what you think, but also even more ridiculous. I am not starting a billion-dollar company. I am building a rocket that could go up with a person like you could ride a stubborn horse\u2014only once, only maybe to the edge of what we call the place where we are. It\u2019s an idea. It\u2019s my idea. I won a municipal innovation grant. The town thinks it\u2019s a sculpture. The town is half-right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won a what?\u201d Lark said, feeling the small grin that made people think she had a joke even when she didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWestfield Municipal Arts and Innovation Fund. Sponsored by the mall and a person who made a lot of money selling water in cans. They think they\u2019re paying for a pretty thing to put outside the library with the plaque that says 'we dreamed,' and they are. But also, if you engineer a sculpture correctly, you can use it to leave.\u201d\n\nShe said all this casual, like a grocery list. Lark touched the cool skin of the cylinder with her fingertips and felt a ripple of fear because if the thing meant what June meant it to mean, the object in front of her was the exact opposite of a duck. A duck said: come close, because I\u2019m in the world and so are you. A rocket said: you can go. To the other side of night. To the black that is not empty.\n\n\u201cThis is illegal,\u201d she said, eventually.\n\n\u201cNot at this scale,\u201d June said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s illegal where changes because we push against our own rules long enough that they accommodate us. And I\u2019m not going to the moon. Not yet. I\u2019m going to the sky in a way that matters to me. I need test pilots who are not afraid to breathe hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Lark said. \u201cI nearly fainted at the mall fountain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not looking at you like a pilot,\u201d June said. \u201cI am looking at you like a person who knows what it means to be looked at. There will be cameras. There will be the world. There will be men who want to collect failures the way other men collect foreign coins. They will count. They will say names wrong on purpose. I need someone who knows how to tilt their head and make it not matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to build a rocket and what you need from me is\u2026 posture?\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong other things,\u201d June said. \u201cYou have a platform that is a half-built stage. I have a thing that everyone will want to stand on and shout. We could trade the parts we have.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want my mouth to be a ladder,\u201d Lark said, and June grinned, guilty.\n\n\u201cAnd also,\u201d June added, softer. \u201cI want something else. I want to give you a piece of sky that is never going to have a duck in it.\u201d\n\nLark looked at her sister then and felt time fold weirdly. When they were teenagers, they had lay on the trampoline in Tamara\u2019s yard and watched planes cross, tiny white lines drawn by cold. June would say their flight numbers like a magic trick\u2014she\u2019d look them up and whisper secret numbers like spells. She wanted to be a pilot then, then an engineer, then a person who found a way to be both because why stop. Lark wanted to be in front of a camera because inside the lens things behaved. Now they stood here again, older and more ourselves.\n\n\u201cYou get it,\u201d June said. \u201cYou get it the way the pond gets the moon. Takes it like a fact and still makes it beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe rest of that week was small and big at once. Denise called daily with instructions that felt like they were written in a font designed to erase you. Post the thing. Laugh at yourself. Say \u201cI just have a tiny quirk\u201d in the baby voice people use to sell cute. Lark posted nothing. She went to the grocery store and a woman from the bank put her hand on Lark\u2019s wrist and said, \u201cI feel exactly how you feel but about escalators, and I still go on them because there\u2019s no staircase at Target,\u201d which warmed Lark in a place that fame had not reached. A high school friend texted \u201cAre you in town or am I seeing your ghost at Beans & Books,\u201d which was the name of the cafe that had survived the war against big coffee somehow, weak but undefeated. Her father planted beans like the world would continue. June built.\n\n\u201cNot everyone is going to like this,\u201d June warned, when she finally had a prototype that made noises not unlike a large cat in yoga. They stood in the cul-de-sac. The neighbors had collected themselves in chairs like an audience at a small town parade. Mr. Roscoe, who ran the radio repair store, wore a hat that said 20 METERS MAKES LIFE. Children wore headphones and skepticism. The newspaper sent a kid with a notebook who described himself as a student of journalism and then asked if he could film it vertical for Instagram because that\u2019s where the paper\u2019s engagement lives, ma\u2019am.\n\n\u201cI never asked everyone to like me,\u201d June said. \u201cI asked them to brace.\u201d\n\nThe first test did what first tests do. It shivered and stuttered. It huffed. It lifted an inch and then politely sat back down like someone changed their mind. Mr. Roscoe clapped anyway. A man named Ron (there\u2019s always a Ron) rolled his eyes and said, \u201cIt\u2019ll never work with an off-the-shelf compressor. You need injection. That, or a miracle.\u201d Someone else snorted. A child said, \u201cCan it go to Mars,\u201d as if Mars were a mall.\n\n\u201cPeople think miracles are a kind of lightning bolt,\u201d June said later, when they sat on the garage step with two sweating bottles of soda that tasted like lemon and other lemon. \u201cReally a miracle is just a lot of tiny mechanical parts saying yes at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to make it say yes,\u201d Lark said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to listen for where to say I\u2019m sorry,\u201d June said. \u201cDon\u2019t say that to the paper. They like you confident or nothing.\u201d\n\nLark walked to the pond again even though it was a bad idea. She liked bad ideas that involved footwear and short distances and no press. Beside the bench there was a man feeding ducks even though the posted sign said do not feed them, bread is bad for birds. He made a show of ignoring the sign, which is a familiar performance. He had that kind of shirt older men wear like a story, with a small embroidered ship that suggested he\u2019d been a captain of something maybe or just in the navy or just liked a sale. He glanced at her twice. He had seen her in a movie once and not remembered her name. He had seen her in a picture yesterday and learned it for the pleasure of saying it wrong.\n\n\u201cLark,\u201d he said, which was the first time anyone said it like a scold. \u201cYou know they\u2019re just ducks. The world is burning and you\u2019re afraid of ducks.\u201d\n\nShe stood there with her hands in her pockets and felt like someone had opened a window before the house was warm enough to want it.\n\nHe continued, because men like to complete the sound of their own lessons. \u201cPeople got real problems. Real things to be afraid of. I got a brother who can\u2019t sleep unless he sees his meds on the dresser. That\u2019s fear. Yours is\u2026 c\u2019mon. It\u2019s like saying you\u2019re allergic to Tuesdays.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and because she had learned some things from actors who are also fighters, she separated her body into two layers: the place where the words would go and the place where her shame would live. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m not being heroic enough for your enjoyment. I\u2019m not being brave in the way that photographs well. I didn\u2019t ask to be. Why do we all keep asking everyone to impress us. Maybe some of us are just people with bones and batteries and a weird kind of brain.\u201d\n\nHe muttered something that might have been a dismissal or a swear. A duck came closer and she took a step back. Someone took a photo. The world made a click. She held her ground anyway. The town would read about it and be split down the middle because towns love to be split and then slowly healed by an event involving pie.\n\n\u201cCome by the garage,\u201d June said, when Lark told her about it later, small and brittle. \u201cI need your arm strength to hold this steady while I recalibrate the thrusters. No\u2014you have tiny wrists. I need your attention instead. Attention is the stronger muscle. Hold this thing in your head and don\u2019t look away.\u201d\n\nIt was good work, the kind that made your brain quiet enough inside. June explained each thing out loud to herself and the room like she was both teacher and student. The rings aligned. The tubes hissed. The valves listened. They were making a thing that wanted to leave. That was the part that kept sticking inside Lark\u2019s chest: the audacity of not just wanting to leave, but building the door. She had left Westfield earlier than people thought she would. That was nothing. She\u2019d used airplanes and cars and trains and a talent people liked to believe came from nowhere. This was not that. This was making movement from a held breath.\n\nThat night, Lark posted something. Not a duck video. Not a joke. A picture of June\u2019s hands, greased and deliberate, holding the edges of the cylinder like you hold a person at the threshold of something, and under it she wrote: The future isn\u2019t over us. We\u2019re still voting on it.\n\nDenise called so quickly it felt like she had been lying in wait.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy sister,\u201d Lark said. \u201cIn case you forgot. And me, choosing a different room to stand in.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Denise said. \u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of gorgeous. Not the hands, the copy. You could sell wellness with that. If you must soft-launch your departure from brand duck-chatter, at least let me be the one to monetize it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I was the brand.\u201d Lark was tired past her bones.\n\n\u201cYou are the brand if the brand can be rescued from birds by a blonde with a toolbox. Just\u2014be careful. The world loves to cheer a woman for leaving and then trip her at the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not blonde,\u201d Lark said. \u201cAnd she carries a welding mask like it\u2019s a crown.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven better,\u201d Denise said, her voice shifting. \u201cSend me three more images. I\u2019ll build a carousel. People love carousels.\u201d\n\nNot everyone did. There were comments that said, Shut up and kiss a duck for charity. There were ones that said, Women have been building rockets since you were in pigtails and now you want clout off it, boo. The ones that hurt more were smaller and close. A woman from her high school wrote, Remember when you laughed at my fear of Ferris wheels, karma is a wheel, babe.\n\n\u201cI did not laugh,\u201d Lark said to the air. \u201cI smiled because your mother had just bought you cotton candy and your face was blue.\u201d\n\nShe stepped back out into the dusk because in Westfield dusk had a texture you could use to heal yourself. June was bent over the rocket again. Her hair stuck to her neck. A small fly considered the back of her hand and then amended its plan when she flicked it away without looking. Lark had a sensation then, a tiny, ambitious one, of a kind she would probably have to fight. It felt like wanting to be a part of whatever June's life was turning into in a way that would matter historically. It felt like the beginning of an answer to a question she had not dared put into her mouth. It felt like movement toward something that wouldn\u2019t fit neatly into a segment on late night television.\n\n\u201cYou test again tomorrow,\u201d Lark said.\n\n\u201cIf the goose-neck fittings arrive,\u201d June said. \u201cIf Ron doesn\u2019t try to sabotage me with his opinions. If the town allows it. Pax Roscoe is sending the mayor\u2019s office a tray of donuts. He swears donuts do more than petitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou asked for support,\u201d Lark said, remembering the way towns attach themselves to something like ivy climbing a wall and then tear it down later when it gets too tall.\n\n\u201cI asked for a clean launch window,\u201d June said. \u201cSupport is\u2026 noise.\u201d\n\nThe next morning the mayor came by with a camera crew from the station that only ran news when there was an incident at the high school or when the cherry blossoms hit all at once and everyone lost their minds. She wore a blue jacket like a sky promise and said words over a microphone about innovation and community and liftoff. A man from the fire department evaluated the extinguishers and issued a mild frown. Mr. Roscoe wore his hat again like a permission slip. Children sang a song no one had written for this occasion, a song about up and away they\u2019d learned from a cartoon. Lark stood beside June and put her body\u2019s quiet to the service of the moment. If she let the moment say, This is a circus, then that would be the truth. If she let it say, This is a debut, then that would be true as well. The truth was a kite; it doesn\u2019t fly unless you move.\n\nThe prototype rose three inches. It sank. Boom? No. A tap on the ground that made a sound like a large hand clapping politely in a hall. A piece of the crowd cheered anyway. Ron tried to be seen not cheering. The kid from the paper took his vertical video. The mayor kissed June on the cheek and whispered something Lark did not hear, and June\u2019s face did something Lark had not seen on it since she was sixteen and her teacher had put a perfect score on a physics exam and then written \"but where will you put this, June?\" in the margin like an accusation.\n\n\u201cI will put it,\u201d June had told that paper with her pencil, a little angrily, \u201cin the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want pie,\u201d their father asked later because he had cooked two pies in a row for comfort and no matter the occasion pie was a rational response. Lark ate pie. June ate pie like fueling. Denise texted to say the video had been seen by 1.3 million strangers. Lark read the comments even though she knew not to. She cried anyway, not at the cruelty but at the strange kindnesses that come like postcards from people you will never meet who understand the shape of your problem like it\u2019s a thing they can hold.\n\nThere were other moments in that first week that made a chapter: a small girl in a sparkly yellow dress who asked Lark to sign the inside of her book because her mother said you sign inside the cover if the person means it; a man who drove past and shouted \u201cQuack-quack\u201d as if this was the height of wit; the priest from the church with the red doors saying, \u201cWe are not hosting the launch, but we would love to bless the driveway if you think it would help,\u201d and finding a way to make that sweet and not ridiculous. June hammered. Lark answered questions that no one had asked her in the same way twice before, she crafted yeses that weren't lies, not all the time.\n\nLate the night before the second test, June sat with her feet in the plastic baby pool because she said the earth was too far away for her ankles. Lark leaned on the garage doorway. It was like that the best conversations found them\u2014near tools, tired, unguarded.\n\n\u201cThis might fail,\u201d June said, into the pool\u2019s small echo. \u201cNot just this test, the whole thing. It might be an exercise that makes everyone think about how they end up back where they started. And I\u2019ve spent everything. Not money. I mean the juice. The part of me that thinks new things. What if it goes quiet after this and I am just\u2026,\u201d she made a small motion with her hands, letting them fall, \u201csomeone who talked loudly about the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not be just someone who talked,\u201d Lark said. \u201cYou will be someone who tried. I hate that word too. It sounds like a mother telling you \u2018eat the broccoli at least try it at least try.\u2019 But I mean it like\u2026 like the part you keep for yourself. You will know. And I will know. Everyone else can go line up at Ron\u2019s for their requested opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I wish you were meaner,\u201d June said.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Lark said. \u201cJust not to you.\u201d\n\nThe second test cut something open in the air and poured light through. For a breath it looked like a coin flicked up and maybe, maybe, maybe a miracle\u2014that chorus of tiny parts\u2014would sing. Three feet, four, six. People shouted like they were at a high school game they had been waiting to win for twenty years. June\u2019s face opened. Lark\u2019s body leaned toward the noise. The thing hung and then came back, slow enough to be called descent instead of drop. When it touched the ground the crowd exhaled as a creature and some of them realized they had been holding their phones and they looked down to check if their recording had happened like it was supposed to. The firefighter who had frowned earlier smiled. The mayor did a little dance. Ron started to walk away and then pretended he had always meant to walk.\n\nJune turned to Lark and raised both hands without words. Lark slapped them with hers and felt silly and happy, like a cheap version of God had given her permission to be outside of herself.\n\n\u201cIt works,\u201d June said. \u201cIt might work.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything works until it doesn\u2019t and then it works again,\u201d Lark said, choosing to be both cheerleader and philosopher because the moment allowed it. \u201cAlso, you will soon have to file so much paperwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater. Now is for taking two pictures and making a face,\u201d June said. She made a face. Lark took the pictures.\n\nThey celebrated by eating noodles from the place that had always been there and pretended to be new for the kids who came home from college. Lark sat on the curb with her takeout box and watched the sky become that weird Westfield purple. She could feel the planet turning, which was a trick she had learned from her grandmother: stand still, focus on the tall tree like it is fixed, and then let your mind decide the tree is holding still and you are, too, relative to it, so everything else becomes the thing that moves. When she did this, her fear felt like another sphere she might step off. Persuadable. Not cured. Never call it cured. That word steals maintenance.\n\nA teen girl came up and said, \u201cI liked you in 'Frontier Heart' and I liked that you screamed like a normal person when the ghosts came. Now they\u2019re being mean because you screamed in a park. I think that\u2019s stupid,\u201d and Lark said thank you with a genuine thank and not a celebrity hearing her own line read. The town did what towns do: it made a place for her until it forgot to and then it remembered again.\n\nDenise called one more time with that tone that meant a war council. \u201cThey offered you the barn-find romance,\u201d she said, naming a script like you name a weather pattern. \u201cThe one where you find a car and a man and your true self all in a field with good lighting. There\u2019s one scene with ducks in it but they said you can be doubled.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing a duck double,\u201d Lark said. \u201cAlso I\u2019m not doing a barn find romance. I am not a woman who discovers that she loves manual labor only when a man touches her hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Denise said, after a beat. \u201cYou\u2019re also being offered an independent film by that director who always casts sharp women. Two scenes in a kitchen. A monologue that might break people. No animals except metaphorical. They pay you nothing and they will love you forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to help June,\u201d Lark said. \u201cI want to\u2026 I think I want this to be what matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do both,\u201d Denise said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do everything. Pick two. Not three. Two. The third will eat you.\u201d\n\nIn bed that night, Lark tried to pick. She could feel the two on each shoulder like the old cartoons. Film and June. Fame and family. Or\u2014cleaner names. Story and sky. Inside her, the ducks had found a different pond. They were quieter. They were still there. She had not defeated them like a hero in a cheap plot. She had done something else, which was to reorient her fear toward a different north. The new coin spinning in the dark was a thing June had set in motion and Lark could, if she wanted, keep that coin in the air with the one thing she had that wasn't gone: attention that bent other people's eyes.\n\nIn the morning, she wrote the director with the sharp women and said yes. She wrote Denise and said no to the barn car and the man and the field. She wrote the mayor and asked if they could find a way to keep the library open late on launch nights. She wrote to nobody the story about the man at the pond and his thin mercy and then she changed the endings until the ducks in it did nothing but drift like thoughts.\n\nAnd she went to the garage and held the flashlight while June crawled under the belly of a thing that wanted to be dangerous so it could be useful, or useful so it could be beautiful\u2014it was hard to untangle the words. She stood there with her arms up and the light steady and she thought, not about the movie she had turned down or the one she would do, but about a bus she had ridden once all the way to the end of the line when she had been thirteen and furious. She thought how good it had felt, the wheels making a long loud vowel out of the road. She pictured the bus pulled up at a curb she did not yet know, the driver looking in the mirror to see if anyone else would get off, the sign in front flashing OUT OF SERVICE and meaning it.\n\nShe moved the light a little to the left. \u201cHere?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cRight there,\u201d June said. \u201cHold it right there. Don\u2019t blink.\u201dChapter 3\n\nThe packages started arriving like cheerful apologies from strangers. They were tidy, stacked, taped with care as if the tape itself could be the balm. On the porch one morning there was a waterlogged box that had once been full of grapefruit, a bright purple bubble mailer, a brown envelope with a child\u2019s handwriting that marched and listed like a troop. Inside: rubber ducks with sunglasses, rubber ducks with tiny capes, a ceramic duck with eyelashes like a car from the fifties, a hand-knit duck that had suffered a little in the mail and leaned forward like it needed a cane. There were notes, too, written on index cards and napkins and the backs of old school fliers. The notes had the cadence of confession. I\u2019m scared of geese, wrote someone from Colorado. I can't stand balloons, wrote someone else, too much waiting for a pop. I faint when I see blood, said a nurse who kept a peppermint in her cheek and pinched her own thigh at the sight of a paper cut. June lined them up on the kitchen island until the island looked like a tiny, bright city founded on the premise that everything floatable should be honored for trying.\n\nDenise texted Lark a picture of a billboard on Sunset that someone had altered: the ad originally for a perfume now had a duck sticker over the bottle and a speech bubble that said, quack if you love chaos. \u201cWe can sell this,\u201d Denise said over the phone, not pretending at hello. \u201cNot the duck thing\u2014God deliver me from the duck thing\u2014but the pivot. The sister with the rocket. The two of you against inertia. I\u2019m getting DMs from three production companies who do docuseries with the word \u2018intimate\u2019 in the pitch deck. Also, the Fallon team will book you if you bring your sister, and they promise no animals, fake or otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t doing Fallon,\u201d Lark said, walking a box in from the porch with one hip while holding the door with a knee because her hands were full of plush zoology.\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t,\u201d Denise said briskly. \u201cBut America loves to revise. The meme fatigue cycle is approximately seventeen hours. Seize hour eighteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s building a rocket,\u201d Lark said. \u201cShe\u2019s not building a narrative arc for a ten-minute segment with a cutaway to Roots drummer applause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are not mutually exclusive,\u201d Denise said, and Lark could hear her typing, a soft wingbeat. \u201cListen. Don\u2019t say yes yet. Don\u2019t say no. Say you are considering. Meanwhile I want three clean images of June that look like the future without looking like the future is sponsored.\u201d\n\nThrough the open doorway she saw June shirtless to her sports bra, her hair braided now because even practicality likes to feel contained, lifting the top shell of the cylinder with a friend\u2019s help. The friend was a woman from June\u2019s old robotics club in high school named Sita, and she had driven in from three towns over with a socket set most people would be happy to be buried with. Sita had a baby sleeping in a sling against her chest that breathed in small important ways as she torqued. The baby\u2019s fingers flexed and opened around air, as if claiming it. Lark took the requested images. She framed the shot so the stroller wasn\u2019t visible, not to erase anything but because she could feel it: the way a stranger would look at the picture and say, Woman works while mothering, and call it brave and then use the word as a handclap they could be done with. June\u2019s face in the pictures made a third option. The muscle in her jaw spoke more truth than a caption could.\n\nThere was a flyer on the cafe corkboard that morning between a missing ferret and a notice for a book club that only read romance novels where someone was a ghost. \u201cTown Listening Session,\u201d the flyer said in the mayor\u2019s assistant\u2019s earnest font, all round vowels and optimism. \u201cProposed Demonstration: Municipal Arts and Innovation Project (Scalable Kinetics Installation), Public Safety Protocol, Q&A.\u201d Someone had drawn in pen beside the official words: rockets?? and then, below that, a different hand had written yes rockets, we are the town, and then a third hand had written, if it explodes do we get to keep the pieces. Lark ordered her coffee and a lemon cookie that pretended to be a breakfast by having oats and sat in the corner where she\u2019d once kissed a boy who had been interesting because he\u2019d known all the names of the constellations and had not yet known the names of his own limits. The cafe radio did the thing small town radios do where they fold themselves around your years\u2014a song from ten summers ago, a voice that had aged with you, a commercial for a basement waterproofing company that added ducks to the sound effects and then apologized with humor that never quite made the apology stick.\n\nPax Roscoe came in with a tray of donuts and a grin that was half salesman, half saint. He wore the hat again (20 METERS MAKES LIFE) and he shook Lark\u2019s hand like he was a person who knew his strength. \u201cI put a word in with the mayor about the fire line,\u201d he said, as if saying the phrase \u201cfire line\u201d were a communion. \u201cAnd a little something to the FAA woman so she knows we\u2019re not trying to start a man-with-ideas nightmare.\u201d\n\n\u201cFAA woman?\u201d Lark said. She felt a small ripple across her stomach, a familiar one that meant the thing was getting bigger and real, and that she would have to be brave in the right direction.\n\n\u201cInspector. Specialist. Person who knows which forms grow up to be other forms,\u201d Pax said. \u201cName\u2019s Irene. She\u2019s been at Mojave and places where people look at air like land that hasn\u2019t been claimed. You two will like each other. She uses the word \u2018consequence\u2019 like it\u2019s a wheel you turn, not a punishment.\u201d\n\nJune pretended not to listen but you could tell she was listening because she cleaned the same spot on the stainless twice. \u201cGood,\u201d she said eventually. \u201cIrene is a name I trust.\u201d She wrote it on the chalk wall under \u201cthings that can keep me from lighting the match\u201d and then drew a small heart beside it like a dare to fate.\n\nThe town listening session was held in the library meeting room where they\u2019d hosted many a bake sale and a poetry night and once, disastrously, a youth improv troupe whose only tool was shouting. Someone had painted the wall with a mural years before: a splash of pond water (of course the pond), a blue sky with birds (they were too round to be ducks, a gift), and children holding hands in a way that real children don\u2019t, with earnest elbows. Folding chairs made their metal music. The mayor had learned how to speak into a microphone without flinching. She wore her hair up like a librarian who had once driven straight through the night because the road permitted it. \u201cWe are here to listen,\u201d she said, and the way she said we contained all the ways a town is still a mess and a miracle at once.\n\nRon had a clipboard. Even his clipboard had a posture. He had collected signatures that said nothing on them except a name and the desire to be on the record against something. He stood up first like men in rooms have learned to do, and he waved the clipboard as if he could make the sound of his paper louder than the sound of an engine. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live here. It\u2019s noise and danger. There are birds. There are children. There are cars with paint that will get dust on them. There\u2019s precedent. There\u2019s liability. There\u2019s my dog that barks at unusual frequencies. There\u2019s my wife who has migraines.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring your wife to me,\u201d said the woman behind Lark who turned out to be the town\u2019s acupuncturist, soft-voiced, fierce. \u201cWe will fix her head and your dog can come too. And as for danger\u2014aren\u2019t you at least a little bored of not doing anything we can tell our grandkids about?\u201d\n\nA murmur traveled the room like the thought of weather. June stood when it was her turn and did not do the cuteness of apologizing. She was precise. \u201cThe fuel is not what you are imagining,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no mass driver. There is no bomb. The small violent part of this will be contained here,\u201d she pointed to the diagram, \u201cand the part that concerns your hearing will be managed here and here and with cones, and with distance. The worst case scenario is not even the worst case scenario you have already imagined. It is that this does a small hop and lands wrong and we have a dent. We have protocols. I will have Irene. I want to put a pretty thing in front of the library. When it has done what I want it to do, it will still be a pretty thing. Your taxes will not pay anything additional to what they are already paying for kids to draw and people to have a place to come when they can\u2019t pay for internet.\u201d\n\nHer hands made shapes in the air while she talked, and the shapes were geometry that had learned to dance without embarrassment. Lark watched the room watch her and felt that small old jealousy that was not about attention but about certainty. When June finished, Lark couldn\u2019t hold back. She stood up without knowing what her second sentence would be and decided to pretend this was a late-night segment of the good kind, the kind without a couch, the kind where you speak like a person rather than a person playing a person. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me to tell you what fear feels like,\u201d she said, and she saw heads tilt because anyone who had a knee or a grandparent had a fear. \u201cYou also don\u2019t need me to tell you that you live here and it\u2019s your town and you love it in the exact way that makes you put your name on a piece of paper that says no when something looks like it might rearrange your peace. But I want to borrow your attention for what a yes looks like. It looks like your kids seeing a thing that doesn\u2019t apologize for wanting up. It looks like a day that isn\u2019t the same as other days, and you being a part of that instead of watching it later on someone else\u2019s screen and then pretending you\u2019d been there. And, selfishly, it looks like a person like me, who you are generously tolerating at your grocery store, standing out there and not being afraid. Not because my fear is over, but because I chose to stand in another direction while it kept doing its job. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s my ask. I brought cookies.\u201d\n\nShe had indeed brought cookies because a woman on the internet once told her that if you are going to ask a group for a favor, you should bring small sugary discs to confuse their lizard brains into saying yes with glucose. She held up the tin and felt ridiculous and also absolutely correct. The librarian beamed the librarian beam of people who know you can fix many things with sugar and shelves.\n\nIrene came over afterward and introduced herself like someone who had drilled the introduction into a standard and then abandoned the standard for a handshake that actually meant yes. She had a streak of brilliant white through her otherwise dark hair and a nose that had been broken once in a story she didn\u2019t tell. She wore a shirt that said AVOIDABLE INCIDENTS ARE MY LOVE LANGUAGE and she handed June a packet of forms that groaned under the saddle of their own acronyms. \u201cI brought a simplified version,\u201d she said in a voice that had taught many men how to listen. \u201cWe will still need the unsimplified version. I will help you write the words they want to hear without making you lie. You\u2019ll give me a hazard analysis that looks like you know what wind can do to a person\u2019s best intentions. You\u2019ll show me a perimeter that\u2019s not just cones and hope. You\u2019ll tell me where your flame goes when it realizes it can\u2019t go where it wanted to. In exchange I\u2019ll keep the feds from loving you to death with concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what do you want besides the absence of paperwork sins?\u201d June asked, her eyes alive because here was a person who liked language and engines in equal measure.\n\n\u201cI want my kid,\u201d Irene said, nodding toward a lanky human in a black hoodie who was pretending not to be her kid near the young adult shelves, \u201cto see a woman in a welding mask be the cause of a road closure for a good reason. And I want to watch a room full of men recalibrate how they classify the sound of competence.\u201d\n\nThe signatures on Ron\u2019s clipboard were many and also, Lark noticed, the same six names written twice. Sita strolled past and said, casually and on purpose, \u201cRon, bring your dog to the test. If it barks at unusual frequencies we can calibrate your neighbor\u2019s wind chimes,\u201d and then kissed the baby on the temple and left the room fragranced with almond oil and a small future.\n\nTamara came back from Santa Fe with different hands. They were still her hands, strong and ornamental, but they seemed less in love with mess and more in love with the form that a mess dreams of becoming. She put her bag down in the hallway and hugged both the girls, making an equal sign of her arms, then stepped back to look at the line of ducks on the counter. \u201cYou could glaze these,\u201d she said, picking up one of the ceramic ones. \u201cYou could make a flotilla with a finish that would make anyone forgive anything. But I suppose forgiveness is not the real project here.\u201d She scratched her neck thoughtfully, which was a tell that she was remembering something she hadn\u2019t wanted to remember. \u201cDid I ever tell you about the kiln that failed the night before the gallery opening?\u201d she said, moving into a story like you move into a pool\u2014one foot, then the other. \u201cI had my pieces inside. I\u2019d named them like they were children. The firing stalled halfway and the glazes blistered. I cried like people cry over the truly lost. Then I took a shard to the light and it was somehow better for the accident. It reflected wrong. The owner of the gallery put it in the window and people came in for the shards. They called them honest. I wanted to punch everyone and also kiss them. That\u2019s how a near catastrophe sometimes behaves.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying you want the rocket to blister?\u201d June said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying I recognize the look on your face,\u201d Tamara said. \u201cAnd I know the high after the near miss. And I know the crash after the high. And I brought you both New Mexico candy that tastes like a church smells.\u201d She went to the cabinet precisely where she hadn\u2019t left anything and put away her mug as if she had never left at all.\n\nAt night, when the house was a small boat in a very friendly sea, Lark stood outside on the patch of concrete that had been chalk-painted a hundred times by a hundred small hands. The heat had gone out of the day and she could feel, if she let her skin do some listening, the way the neighborhood exhaled. She thought about the docuseries offers and the way a camera could make a feast of something and leave bones. She thought about her career which in certain circles was described as a list of intentional choices, when really it had been a series of doors opening because she was standing near them when someone else got tired of holding them up. She thought about the small boy by the pond who had somehow given her more kindness in ten seconds with his eyebrows than strangers on the internet had in several frustrated days. She did not think about ducks. She thought about speed.\n\nThe tests proliferated like small holidays. The town learned how to gather without demanding a parade. Children learned words that you do not need to know until you need to know them: ablative, thrust, throttle, abort. Irene stood with her arms folded like a general and learned the names of everyone under twelve within twenty feet of the tape. The tape was not really tape, it was a suggestion; the town obeyed because it likes being asked by a person who sounds like an answer. The prototype hopped again and again, each hop a new paragraph, each landing a small plausible grace. A man from the state called with a voice that said he had been asked to be mean. He asked questions as if the questions could be warmer if he held them long enough under his breath. June answered in two languages at once: the language of compliance, the language of honesty. Lark watched the transaction with a fascination she had once reserved for two actors who dislike each other kissing in one take.\n\nBetween hop days, life shrank and steadied. Lark went to the grocery store and learned again which aisle the beans were in, because in every town the beans are somewhere different based on the logic of a manager who has a quiet philosophy about legumes. She chose the independent film and read the script on the back steps, stopping sometimes to make her mouth practice saying the long lines with the kind of ease that would make them sound like borrowed everyday thought. The script was good enough to make her jealous of the writer in a way that felt like respect. The director called and asked her about hunger and silence. Lark told her about the ducks and then wished she hadn\u2019t, not because it made her smaller, but because it made her story sound like a hook on which people could hang what they already believed about her. \u201cNo animals,\u201d the director said, laughing softly. \u201cJust knives and soup.\u201d She meant the monologue, which had both.\n\nJune started keeping a failure budget in chalk on the wall, which was both a joke and a devotional practice. Under the words she wrote numbers that stood for how many times it would be allowed to go wrong before the going wrong meant stop. She ended the list with an arrow that pointed to a sheet of paper pinned neatly: CATASTROPHIC, which was a word you can\u2019t say out loud in a suburb without someone flinching. She flinched. Then she put her finger under the arrow like a lawyer making a case to a jury and said, \u201cWe won\u2019t go there.\u201d Tamara touched her face with two fingers like she was anointing her with the idea.\n\nWhen the third test day finally announced itself by arriving without apology, Westfield wore its best blue. The air was the kind that made old men say words like crisp and then mime the act of biting a fruit. Irene set out the perimeter like a prayer rug. She had orange markers and a tape measure and a certain stillness in her body that made children quiet themselves within radius. Pax brought the donuts again and also coffee that steamed like a promise. The mayor had learned and now wore flat shoes because she had turned her ankle at the last hop and then laughed about it in a way that made her instantly re-electable. Ron had brought his dog, a beagle who had eyes that apologized in advance for anything that might go wrong. There was blessedly not a duck in sight. It was as if the town had drafted a memo and sent it down to the pond shore asking politely for civic kindness.\n\nLark took her place by the cones with a half-familiar sensation, the one that came when a hundred eyes would roam over a room and then decide to stop on her because stopping on her made sense with the story they had brought. She was good at making that pause feel right. She let the story be the rocket, be the whoosh that was a possibility and not a promise. She kept her mouth shut the way she had learned to before takes so she didn\u2019t waste the breath she would need in the scene. She made her face into something that told children this was safe enough and told the old men this was serious. She did not look at the horizon because sometimes the horizon takes and sometimes it gives, and today she needed it to give.\n\nJune strapped on the helmet even though it wasn\u2019t a helmet yet so much as a habit. She ran her hand over the side panels the way you do when you love a thing you made, which is to say with a small motion that would not be noticeable if you did not know how to love. Sita stood five feet away with her hand on the kill switch because some friendships are built on the agreement that you will be the person who stops the thing before it becomes a story at a funeral. Irene caught Lark\u2019s eye and nodded once, the nod that says: this is the moment I earn my salary and you earn nothing and we both get paid in the same currency anyway.\n\nThe engine sounded like a creature clearing its throat kindly. It was not a roar yet; it was a request to the air to consider a new arrangement. Lark held herself very still in a way she had learned while holding seventeen-pound gowns on red carpets until her vertebrae sang. The rocket lifted the way a person gets up from a broken chair, careful, cheeky. A boy, maybe the one from the skate park, let out a yelp that made his mother put her hand on his head as if to keep his skull from flying off with excitement. June\u2019s eyes were not on the rocket. They were on her own instruments, the ones she had taped to the inside of her brain and the cheap ones wired to the side with zip ties. The thing rose higher than it had any right to and then hung in the way that makes you think time is a human invention, which of course it is.\n\nSomeone in the back of the crowd shouted, in that tone a certain kind of local man uses to keep time on his side, \u201cLook out!\u201d and several heads turned in the wrong direction because evolution still has a sense of humor. The wind shifted. It was the smallest betrayal. A leaf flicked from a maple and crossed through the plume like a dare. Lark braced because there are habits the body keeps and one of them is learning how to catch yourself before you fall in front of people. From nowhere and not nowhere at all, two mallards arrowed across the far end of the cul-de-sac, green heads small with distance, bodies cut tight like a bow on the idea. They chose the sky as the thing deserving of their morning and did not consult anyone\u2019s phobias or plans. Nobody but Lark saw them because the rocket had stolen the scene. She felt the old flicker inside\u2014a little harmless electrical storm\u2014and then she noticed, miraculously, that it didn\u2019t co-opt the rest of her. The fear had a seat with a belt on, just as June had promised. The rest of her kept its job.\n\nThe rocket stuttered, a half hiccup, and June murmured something to it that sounded like a lover\u2019s private encouragement. Sita\u2019s finger hovered just above the switch in the way of people who make choices with millimeters. Irene watched the arc with eyes that counted liabilities and sons. The beagle barked once and then put his head down, satisfied that he had said what any dog must say in the face of hubris and fire. Ron, perhaps against his will, let a grin flicker on his mouth like a contraband flame.\n\nIt climbed. It came back. It landed with a soft thud that you could describe to a person who loved baseball as a perfect catch. There was a beat where you could hear the small, precise glitter of metal cooling, and then the town made a noise that was equal parts fairground and church. Lark clapped and yelled and felt like her organs had arranged themselves in a way doctors would applaud. June lifted both fists and then softened, because one of the little kids started to cry from the suddenness of relief, and June is the kind of person who can shape adrenaline into a consoling hand in two seconds. She crouched and said, \u201cIt\u2019s loud because it\u2019s alive. Loud is not always bad,\u201d and the child hiccuped and imprinted a little on the idea.\n\nThe moment after a thing works is the most dangerous moment. This is a law. You can ruin a good cake by being too sure, you can ruin a marriage by assuming you\u2019ve already done the hard part, you can ruin a delicate truce with your own mind by thinking, finally, that you are free of the old alarms. June knew the law. She had written the law on the chalkboard under the failure budget. She redirected the adrenaline into the only ritual that keeps gods pacified: she did the checklist. She put a hand on a valve; she thanked it; she told Sita to cut power like it was a bedtime story. When she stood up, she didn\u2019t look toward cameras or the mayor. She looked at Lark and Lark did that thing with her mouth that millions of people had incorrectly read as a secret, a coyness. It wasn\u2019t coy. It was an attempt not to cry in public, and she failed at it completely.\n\nAfter, in the wake, when donuts were eaten with reverence and the baby slept through the congratulations and a boy asked if he could touch the scorch mark and then bragged to no one and everyone that he had touched the scorch mark, Irene took June\u2019s hand in both of hers in a gesture that made Lark\u2019s throat get soft. \u201cYou have something rare,\u201d Irene said. \u201cNot the metal. The quiet where the decisions live. If anyone tries to buy it from you, call me and I will bring you a baseball bat.\u201d She meant it. The mayor speechified briefly, using words like legacy and we which hit differently when you\u2019d watched her wince after stepping off a curb wrong and then laugh her way through the day. Ron put his clipboard down somewhere and forgot to pick it up. Pax Roscoe took the clipboard and wrote on it: LET THE RECORD SHOW, and then a smiley face, because sometimes the record needs punctuation.\n\nBy late afternoon, the town had put itself away in its usual drawers. The cones stacked. The signs went into the trunk of the mayor\u2019s car, where there were already three folding chairs, a jumper cable, a pair of heels, and a spoon. Lark\u2019s father started slicing melon. Tamara set glazes on the table like they were guests. June washed her hands with the exactitude of a surgeon and then, without ceremony, brought out a small box and put it in front of Lark as if she\u2019d been saving the gesture for when a place in the day opened where it could sit without clutter.\n\n\u201cI made you something,\u201d she said, in that tone that offered the thing and a small apology for the fact of it. \u201cIt\u2019s not a charm. It is not a talisman. If it works, it will work because you decide to let a thing work.\u201d\n\nInside was a necklace with a pendant the exact size of a clock face on a doll\u2019s wall. The pendant had been cut from a test scrap of the skin of the rocket, which gave it a brushed dignity. June had etched a circle on it and then the tiniest of notches along the edge, like a compass rose without the drama. In the center there was a small glass dome, and under the dome a sliver of something green and ridiculous that caught the light. \u201cWhat\u2019s the green,\u201d Lark asked, her voice doing that breaking thing it did when the moment got bigger than her ribcage permitted.\n\n\u201cA piece of a duck decoy,\u201d June said, her smile tilted. \u201cFrom the sporting goods at the thrift, because I refused to take anything from a real thing that didn\u2019t volunteer. I fixed it there, under the dome, so it can\u2019t look at you. You can look at it instead. Or not. If you don\u2019t want to wear it, don\u2019t. I will not be offended. I\u2019ll put it on the wall and call it art and say it\u2019s about the tension between fear and propulsion and then I\u2019ll charge five hundred dollars and some person will buy it because they think it will make them interesting. But I made it for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d Lark said, and then, because honesty does not have to be cruel, added, \u201cand beautiful.\u201d She fastened it. The metal was cool and then warm because that is what metal does when you give it the intimacy of skin. She felt not braver, exactly, but held. That was a dangerous word and also the correct one.\n\n\u201cDo we tell the internet,\u201d Denise asked over FaceTime that night, because even in Westfield the internet came to sit on the couch like an old aunt with opinions. \u201cDo we reveal the weird amulet. Do we give them a title card: The Actress And The Rocket Maker? Do I call the woman from Vogue who loves women in overalls?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever we tell them,\u201d Lark said, aiming the phone near but not at her actual face, \u201cwe tell them we are busy and any story they require has to fit between the parts where the work happens. We give them the picture of the scorch mark and a sentence that says, \u2018the point was not the landing, the point was the choice to light.\u2019 And then we go to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoetry,\u201d Denise said, mock-woeful and proud. \u201cI will make it into copy and pretend it was my idea and the cycle of our relational economy will continue. Are you ready for the indie film? They moved your dates up because their funding got skittish and then came back with a new tattoo. There\u2019s a kitchen scene where the block of knives is on the wrong side of the stove. Please do not fix it on set with your hands. We will get a note from props.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will stand very still and tell the truth as invented by someone with more patience than me,\u201d Lark said quietly. \u201cAnd then I will come back for the next thing June asks me to hold.\u201d\n\nThe night was deep in a way cities never allow. The frogs did their scalable symphony. Across the street, the teen drummer\u2019s timing had finally clicked, and he was trying triplets like a person who\u2019d been healed by repetition. The ducks at the pond were probably asleep with half their minds open, keeping an eye on something nobody could identify in broad daylight. Lark lay on her back in her old-not-old room and watched the ceiling fan do its slow three-blade sermon. The necklace sat at her throat. She touched the dome with one finger until her heartbeat found the glass and the glass said: yes, I hear you. She thought about how, as a child, she had believed the moon followed the car because she was in it, and how nobody had said, gently or not, that the moon had other business than her. Now, older, she believed the moon was following everyone because that is how light likes to behave when it hears laughing. She turned her head and saw the silhouette of the rocket through the blind, not a column of ambition anymore but the quiet shape of a thing that had done what it had promised for a day. She didn\u2019t know what the next day would demand. That was the mercy. The whole of the future would kill you if you had to carry it all at once. The next morning only asked for coffee, and an email to the director, and a joke for Irene about filing cabinets learning to breed if left alone, and a list of groceries you could get in town without anyone saying anything about anything except the weather.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d June said from the hallway because she was a person who believed in the spell of that word and said it like it could be carved. \u201cTomorrow we try fire on purpose again. Then after that, wind. Then after that, who knows, maybe we build a boat just to confuse people.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not give Ron a second petition subject,\u201d Lark said, her laugh hushed because the house was sleeping under blankets of time. \u201cBut fine. A boat. I want to learn stars enough to name the going.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now,\u201d June said, and Lark could hear her palms press together out of habit, \u201chold the light when I say the word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Lark said, and the way she said it closed the day with a click that felt like a lid fitting the right jar. She slept as if the world had been re-threaded around her with care, and if a duck passed through her mind it did so at a distance, a small green fact under glass, too busy paddling its half-dream to arrive at the shore of her.Chapter 5\n\nThe day taught itself to be wind before noon. Flags decided to be important, backs of shirts breathed without permission, and every leaf on the block showed its paler underside like it was practicing vulnerability. June slept for three hours like a soldier and then came up from the garage with her hair in two braids and a list, the kind of list that contained both wrenches and strategies. Irene arrived with a coil of caution tape and a bright orange windsock that had clearly had a life on a real field somewhere, its mouth a perpetual surprised O. Pax rolled over a fan on a dolly that he had rebuilt out of a factory reject and an old airplane prop and he apologized to it in advance in case it was about to be asked to lie about the direction of the world.\n\nLark was fresh off a morning of pretending in a kitchen that wasn\u2019t hers. The independent film had found a house two towns over with pale blue cabinets and a view of a soybean field that made everything look like it existed for someone\u2019s nostalgia. The director, Mara, had set the knives block on the wrong side of the stove deliberately, and whenever Lark\u2019s hand reached for it the prop master\u2019s eyebrow would rise like a curtain warning. She kept her hand to herself and put the extra wanting into the way she looked at the actor playing her sister in the scene, who had the kind of coiled intensity that makes casting agents write her name with a little star. The monologue about soup had been shot in two takes because Mara disliked bravery wasted on practice. It had started as a woman describing broth and ended as a neat autopsy of a marriage, and Lark had felt the weight of the pendant on her sternum the way a person feels the suggestion of a seatbelt even when they are standing. When she was done, Mara had come in close and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s a gift when you let a line be ugly before it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d and Lark had nodded like a confession had just rearranged the bones in her face.\n\nShe got home just as the windsock decided west, almost, and a little lazy. June handed her a lemon popsicle without looking like she\u2019d planned it hours ago, and the sour chased the filming taste from her mouth so fast she laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fake wind first, and then we\u2019re going to beg the real stuff to show us its personality,\u201d June said, pointing with her popsicle as if it were a baton. \u201cPax\u2019s Frankenfan from the boneyard, Irene\u2019s sock, Sita\u2019s new handheld anemometer that I promised her I would not lick no matter how much it looks like a strange lollipop. We\u2019ll practice yaw control with no altitude so if we do something dumb we can call it deliberate.\u201d\n\nRon came by to let his dog sniff the cones as if the cones needed to be interrogated by law. He had found another clipboard, because the species reproduces, and this one had a printed sheet on top with the words CITIZENS FOR SENSIBLE SKY written in a font that tried to look like authority and looked instead like a sign for a discount carpet store. Parsons from Parks ducked his head in as well, a gentle man with tall ears who had the keys to the gates nobody else thought about. He said, \u201cWe got a call from a woman saying the ducks are showing signs of stress. She said it like it was a thing you can diagnose by looking at a picture on your phone of a bird that doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s being watched. I told her the ducks\u2019 primary source of stress is bread and teenagers. Then I told her I\u2019d come see for myself, which is me trying to be a modern man. Don\u2019t worry about your afternoon. Just\u2026 if any sound happens, keep it to a song where the chorus is brief.\u201d\n\nIrene took a moment to stand in the driveway and calibrate the air in her bones. She didn\u2019t check the forecast on her phone so much as confirm what her body already believed. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal,\u201d she said, not waiting to be introduced to the room that knew her now without ceremony. \u201cYour left is going to be a liar all day, so anything that wants to yaw left will do it more than it thinks it should. If you can, agree to make the dumb choice with speed instead of smart choice with doubt. Doubt gets you a bruise when wind\u2019s involved. We have a soft abort that\u2019s prettier than last week. Sita, that switch is your religion. Pax, if you plug anything into that power strip that wasn\u2019t on it this morning, I will make you write me an essay about cord ratings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the title of the essay,\u201d Pax asked, grinning in that way that men grin when a steady woman takes their tools away and they love her for it.\n\n\u201cHow to Not Burn Down Friendship,\u201d Irene said, and the grin went reverent.\n\nLark set the social world to quiet the way you dim a lamp by twisting, slow, until your fingers know where to stop. Denise had sent twelve messages in the last hour, even though it was a weekday and she should have had half an agency between her mouth and her thumbs. There were offers that used words like unscripted and authentic and journey, and there was one email from a streaming platform whose logo looked like something you would see on a skate shoe, promising a \u201climited series\u201d about two women and a town and a rocket that would \u201clean into the messy middle.\u201d Lark read the pitches and then closed her email because Irene had said doubt gets you a bruise, and she had enough already. She walked to the edge of the driveway and looked toward the pond without trying to make anything dramatic out of it. It was there, doing what water does in wind, which is to develop scales that catch light and make people talk like the water is breathing differently. She didn\u2019t see any ducks at that moment, which either meant they were elsewhere or that they were practicing being rocks, which is a talent the species uses for survival and mischief.\n\nThey staged the wind day like a play with no audience and as many understudies as possible. The fan roared and found its footing, Pax baby-talking it without shame until the prop found a groove that improved the mood of the cones. Sita had strapped the anemometer onto a broom so she could hold it in the actual path of the fake gusts without losing her hair. June squinted and then made herself open both eyes wide because she\u2019d written on the board that you see more when your face is not inventing a reason to make drama. The first gentle push of air tested a hinge; it juddered and then yielded like a polite uncle backing through a doorway. The second shove nicked a wire that hadn\u2019t been told the day\u2019s plan, and the wire complained by vibrating in a key that made Irene hiss and mark something on her clipboard that wasn\u2019t Ron\u2019s, a nicer clipboard with the corners taped to hold itself together in storms. By the third, June was adjusting in real time in a way that looked like dance, hands and shoulders and the numerical part of her brain making agreements faster than anyone could write them down.\n\nThen the wind Wendy\u2019d itself in for real, an indulgent swirl from the west, and June made the call to lift a foot off the ground. It was not altitude. It was a hover on a creaky barstool, the kind of lift that makes neighbors go, \u201cIs it\u2026 is it up,\u201d and then answer their own question with a helpful \u201coh.\u201d The cross-breath of the day hit the belly of the thing and the thing responded with a swagger, the ugly cousin of grace, wobbling with intent. Sita\u2019s finger didn\u2019t quake over the switch; it poised. Lark watched June watching her instruments and saw the moment the math and the mess parted company like good friends leaving a party at different times. A bolt on the lower port strut\u2014a bolt that had lived a quiet life until wind entered the chat\u2014settled into a new opinion of its purpose and decided, in classic hardware fashion, that it could travel. It didn\u2019t go far. It hopped like a rabbit who\u2019d read a book about parkour and then found itself in the world of real concrete.\n\nThe sound when the strut kissed the driveway was a sound you wouldn\u2019t include in a movie because the foley artist would say no one would believe a thing that small could make a noise that tired. It was a small tired sound, a complaint with a pinch of resignation, and it brought the test down hard enough that a piece of a panel\u2014light, but metal is always itself even when it\u2019s light\u2014flew off at an angle that would have made a geometry teacher clap with delight. It hit the edge of Ron\u2019s truck, which had been parked per Ron\u2019s insistence within the perimeter because it was his right to park on a public street he\u2019d been parking on since Carter. The panel left a dent the size and shape of a dull smile near Ron\u2019s wheel well, and the beagle barked as if its union contract demanded it.\n\nNobody screamed. Sita hit the switch with the love of a woman who knows stopping is a form of affection. June breathed in hard enough that her ribs showed\u2014Tamara\u2019s potter\u2019s instinct noticed even if nobody else would\u2014and then squatted to look at the bolt like she was a detective reading a confession. Irene\u2019s eyes did a quick inventory of children and men and mayor ankles and wires and wind, and then she took the clipboard and wrote in large letters: IMPROPER TORQUE PATH + WIND = STUPID. Pax killed his fan and petted it once, whispering, \u201cyou tried,\u201d as if he were putting a kitten to bed. Ron came forward slow, not because he was afraid but because you walk to a dent the way you walk to a piece of news. He bent, put his hand over the smile in the metal, pressed like he could persuade the truck to remember its previous face, then stood and sighed in a tone nobody expected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a truck,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes places where things bump into it. If I wanted it to be a statue I\u2019d park it in my living room and call it a day.\u201d He flicked the panel with his knuckles and watched the light go through it like it had been made to show off that trick. \u201cYou\u2019ll fix it,\u201d he added, and it wasn\u2019t a question. June nodded, almost bowed, because there are people it feels appropriate to bow to and one of them is the one who just decided not to make your mistake their headline.\n\n\u201cTorque plan was arrogant,\u201d June admitted, which was not the kind of sentence a person says at a town meeting. \u201cI built for perfectly vertical and then tried to teach sideways to become a courtesy. Sideways never becomes a courtesy just because you ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cSideways is my cousin\u2019s entire personality,\u201d Irene said, deadpan. \u201cI will mail you a new plan and I will also remind you, again, to let someone else check your body\u2019s math when you think the math is you.\u201d She pointed at Lark with the tone of a coach, not a critic. \u201cYou. Take her to walk while everyone un-primes their adrenaline. Look at things that aren\u2019t moving. Water, fine. Tree, better. Your own shoes, best.\u201d\n\nThey walked without pretending it wasn\u2019t because the adrenaline needed a place to dissolve. The wind had the bright taste of before a storm without the storm. The pendant sat quiet against Lark\u2019s chest as if it were listening to a story it had heard before and would hear again. They cut along the back way so as not to take the pond path, then turned in anyway because avoidance is a convincing god until it isn\u2019t. There was a boy practicing throwing a tennis ball against the low stone wall and catching it awkwardly, the social language of boys working out how to keep their hands in the world. There was a woman with a stroller talking to a man with a hat and neither of them saying what the conversation was really about, which is the music of small towns. The ducks were across the water near the reeds, subdued by the wind, heads tucked like old men on trains, and Lark watched them the way you watch weather you might need to drive in. They did not cross in front of her mind. They stayed pinned to their page. She breathed. June asked her about the filming, because June believes in rescue by detail, and Lark said, \u201cThe soup was onion, but I didn\u2019t cry until after, and then I cried the way you do when your body has been holding a door shut for an hour and somebody else finally puts their shoulder to the wood.\u201d\n\nJune nodded and picked a twig off a bush without hurting the bush and said, \u201cMara knows where the seam is between hunger and speech. Of course she put the knives on the wrong side. She was training your wrists to argue more quietly. Do you like your scene partner,\u201d and Lark smiled with her mouth more than her eyes because she didn\u2019t want to be cruel. She liked the girl fine, she liked the way the girl worked harder when no one was watching, but she did not like the hunger the girl had about Fame, which was a capital letter that eats its friends.\n\nWhen they came back, the present had decided not to become an emergency. Sita was holding the bolt under a lamp like it owed her money. Pax had the dent on Ron\u2019s truck halfway tamed with a plunger and the kind of good humor that makes a man a local treasure. Irene had her phone out because someone above her line of report had texted, and she was writing things with brevity and affection that would keep her and June both from being eaten by concern. Tamara had put out cut-up peaches with a squeeze of lime and people were using toothpicks in the way that makes them feel like they are taking part in a civilized compromise. The mayor came, saw the dent, saw June\u2019s face doing the thing her face did when she was making a mea culpa into a tool, and said, \u201cWe live here and so do our mistakes. If we start punishing anything that tries, we will end up a town of perfect lawns and nothing else.\u201d\n\nAfter the wind school, the internet tried to have its day. A Facebook group with a name like WESTFIELD REAL TALK posted a video that someone had slowed down and color-corrected until the plume looked unimaginably sinister, and a caption that said \u201cbirds terrified???\u201d with the kind of punctuation you can taste like a sour candy. Someone tagged Lark in a comment that read, \u201cwow, thought u loved animals,\u201d which was such an obvious trap the community college could have used it to teach rhetoric. Denise texted, \u201cWe can correct gently with a video of Irene explaining how ducks hear through skulls and how low frequencies work, with a graphic of a duck in headphones. Or we can ignore and the fire burns itself out because it\u2019s Saturday and there\u2019s a little league tournament, which is your town\u2019s natural resource.\u201d Lark sent it to June and Irene and asked for the hymn they wanted to sing and not the one the hecklers wanted.\n\n\u201cLet Irene sing,\u201d June said. \u201cBut make it about neighbors and decibels and the way we learn to share air. No cute. The minute you go cute about animals the world will demand you bottle it.\u201d\n\nIrene filmed a minute-odd video standing next to the windsock, speaking in the dry, declarative voice of a woman who has taught men not to die with fewer syllables than they expected. She explained SPLs and distance and how long the tests really ran and how no living thing in the vicinity had had its habits altered beyond a brief curiosity peck in the direction of the cones. Lark posted it without filter and with a caption that said, \u201cIf you have questions, ask us. We live here too.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a balm for everyone, but it gave the reasonable something to hold while the unreasonable tired themselves with misuse of commas.\n\nA package came that evening with a return address with NASA in it, the letters printed on the label like an official hand had been attached. Inside was a note in a looping hand addressing June by first name like the writer trusted the world to be smaller than it is. I sewed parachutes for years, the note said, in a sentence that made anyone who read it straighten their shoulders slightly without knowing why. We packed air like a prayer and then we packed fabric like the air had manners. People think courage is a moment, but it\u2019s a thousand stitches. I would like to send you a box of thread I can\u2019t use anymore because my fingers are getting honest about their age. It\u2019s strong and too pretty to hide. The signature was a name that Irene recognized because she put her hand over her mouth briefly, and then she said, \u201cShe used to stand two doors down from me in Mojave and tell the boys to move their coffee. The only person in that hangar whose voice could travel through aluminum and stay itself.\u201d\n\nThey ate pie again because their father had decided to turn his love language into a taper he could keep lit. After pie, he brought down a box from far back in a closet with the care a person uses for an object they have not told themselves is sacred so as not to tempt theft by fate. The box had old photos and the smell of closets that have seen winter coats hang themselves into shapes and then collapse into summer. There were pictures of Lark\u2019s mother that made the girls look like elongated versions of something fragile and ferocious, like a dragonfly wing sized up to a kite. There was a note in their mother\u2019s hand that Tamara hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d left behind, tucked in a book of household jokes like a woman\u2019s idea of camouflage. Luck is noticing the door and then deciding you deserve to test the knob, the note said, and Lark ran her two fingers over the ink like she was petting the idea. The wedding dress story got told, the Dairy Queen cone got remembered and embellished with the exact number of sprinkles because memory likes to be precise when it is lying with love, and nobody made grief into a performance because the house had learned over time to keep its dead very close and very gentle.\n\nThe first docuseries producer flew in and rented a car and used the phrase \u201ctasteful access\u201d in a way that made Lark picture a salad fork being introduced to her bedroom. He sat at Pax\u2019s radio shop to make his pitch because he believed in local color as a marketing strategy, and Pax sold him a pocket AM/FM while he talked as if in punishment for using the phrase \u201cnormal people\u201d within Irene\u2019s hearing. June listened to the man outline a schedule of tears and triumphs and then asked him if he knew the difference between a static test and a hop. When he did not, even after being told twice, she handed him the anemometer and an orange cone and said, \u201cI think you should stand in the backyard and see what the air believes. It\u2019s not going to make for good television, but it will make you a better animal.\u201d He did not like being made into a better animal by a woman in a t-shirt with scorch marks, and Lark, who had once pleased men like this for a living, felt the specific pleasure of letting someone else not please him.\n\nDenise, who could smell a deal in a different zip code by turning her head, called later and said, \u201cWe will say yes if and only if we get to control the time window, the crew count, and the refusal list. Your father will not be filmed waking up from a nap in his chair. Tamara will not be filmed in that way some shows like to film older women, with the camera too close and the light like punishment. Irene will be mic\u2019d only if she wants to be the day she wants to be, and if she says \u2018no\u2019 they will cut the audio and use birds. You, Lark, will not be asked to cry in a close-up for a time when a stiffness bolt goes missing. If any of this is a problem, I will personally write an email that uses the word exploitative so correctly that they will print it out and keep it under a rock.\u201d Lark said she would consider it and meant it in the literal sense, not the Hollywood sense where consider is another word for never.\n\nJune repurposed the rubber ducks\u2014which had taken over a corner of the living room like a bright militia\u2014by sticking straight pins with tiny flags into their backs and dropping them into a shallow tray to map turbulence. She poured water from a watering can with the spout turned to a trickle and watched the way the water learned to creep around obstacles like a mind finding another way to think around a fact. She labeled the ducks in marker\u2014Laminar, Vortex, Wake\u2014and Lark, catching sight of them like that, laughed in a way that wasn\u2019t brave or sad or branded. It was simply relief that even a thing that had frightened her so completely could be conscripted to show them where the air would try to go.\n\nThe boy with the eyebrows showed up with a screwdriver in his pocket and an expression that said he had been sent by twelve versions of himself to see if anybody needed him. His name was Eli, he said, and then he said, \u201cI know Eli is a name that makes you think of kids in old books being nice to women in bustles, but I can carry heavy and I know how to be quiet.\u201d He ran messages from the cones to the garage and back without assuming any of his own messages would be wanted. He drew a duck on the chalkboard, not with malice but because he was fourteen and funny, and then, seeing Lark\u2019s face flicker, he crossed it out and turned it into a rocket with a beak, laughing hard at his own apology. She let herself laugh too because the body wants to be forgiven for things it never did.\n\nThere were two days of rain that felt like a rehearsal for years they hadn\u2019t planned for. The town turned inward in that way that makes everyone learn the sound of their own dryer again. Lark shot nights on the indie in a kitchen lit to look like morning, the kind of trick filmmaking likes to play so the audience will feel warm and then not know why they are crying. During a setup where nothing would settle into the white balance everyone wanted, Mara leaned against the fridge and asked Lark about the pendant like she was asking why Lark wore a particular scar. Lark told her the short version\u2014a duck under glass, a sister making a compass, a problem made small enough to wear\u2014and Mara said, \u201cKeep it for the soup scene,\u201d even though the soup scene was done, because directors often mean keep it forever when they say keep it for a scene.\n\nOn the third morning after wind school, a letter came from the state with the tone of a person who didn\u2019t want to meet but would, and the word HEARING in capital letters like someone tried to make it shout from the paper. Irene read it, rolled her neck, and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go and we\u2019ll talk about the thing we\u2019re actually doing while they try to talk about the thing they are afraid someone will do with our name. Wear something with pockets. Bring a donut. I will make you three lists: what they want to hear, what we need to say, and what they\u2019ll actually remember.\u201d June sharpened a pencil with a pocketknife because sharpening a pencil with a blade is a mood and a choice. Lark asked if she should come and June said, \u201cYes, but not because you are\u2026 you know. You should come because you are very good at stopping a man whose story is about to confuse him. I want you to look at the room the way racks look at a runway. Pick three people and fill their hands with a reason to nod.\u201d\n\nThe hearing was held in a building with carpet that had been installed during a decade when gray was code for serious, and it smelled like everyone\u2019s coats, layer upon layer. A panel sat under a row of flags as if they were expecting a parade to enter if the answers weren\u2019t satisfactory. Two men asked questions in the tone of a dentist explaining the economy of floss. A woman with exquisite eyeliner asked about combustible zones with a curiosity that suggested she had burned things under appropriate supervision before. June spoke in sentences that did not apologize for their own breath. Irene fielded changes of subject the way you field bees you do not want to harm and do not want in your hair. Lark watched the back row, where the man who would write the brief leaned against the wall and tried to pretend he made the shape of a telephone pole. She aimed every yes toward his peripheral vision, because sometimes people are proudest of the things they did not notice they learned.\n\nOn the way back, June drove because her hands needed a task and Lark watched the fields do what fields do after rain, which is to shine with gratitude and pretend it is their doing. They saw a line of cars stopped in both directions near the pond and for a moment Lark thought something had gone wrong with a child or a dog or the duck that had yet to be forgiven for simply existing in her mind. It wasn\u2019t a horror. It was an old small ritual. A row of mallards hustled across the road, their bodies smug with purpose, and the drivers of Westfield did the thing the town taught them to do: they sighed and waited and then told the story later like the ducks did it just to test whether humanity still deserved to be trusted with steering wheels. Lark put her hand to the pendant because she is not a woman who makes herself ache out of stubbornness, and then she watched the green heads bob, one, two, seven, and let the fear tap her like a stranger trying to be introduced. It tapped. She nodded. She looked away deliberately toward the creek that ran under the culvert, and in her peripheral vision she could feel the flock pass and the world resume.\n\nJune touched her arm once, nothing a camera could have captured without being accused of adding a violin. \u201cSeatbelt tight,\u201d June said, as if they were at thirty thousand feet and someone had broken out a harmonica in the next row. Lark smiled and tried to see herself from the outside and then stopped because that is a trick that eats the day.\n\nDenise called with the inevitable contract. Fallon wanted them next Thursday, remote to begin with, a segment from the library lawn with the sculpture-that-was-a-rocket framed so the sponsor wouldn\u2019t complain about free advertising for something the town hadn\u2019t yet branded. \u201cThey will go easy,\u201d Denise promised in a voice that contained both skepticism and love. \u201cThey will ask you about sisters. They will ask you about fear. They will ask you to hold a rubber duck they will pretend to produce as a joke and then reveal it is a candle, not a toy, which their legal told them is okay. They will not send live poultry because their intern has your email where you wrote \u2018do this and I will replace all your curls with bees.\u2019 Pick your shirt. Pick your line you\u2019ll say when they laugh in the wrong place. Don\u2019t pick a fight with America on a Thursday.\u201d\n\nThey said yes because some hells are useful bridges. Lark wrote her lines and then deleted her lines because Mara had reminded her that truth dies when you pre-dig the grave too neatly. June wrote an index card and then tore it in half and then used the halves to shim a fixture in the garage because paper can be a tool even when it refuses to be a guide. Irene called a friend at the network to say, quietly, that if any surprises occurred during the segment she would appear in New York uninvited with a bar of soap and a mom voice. Pax polished the face of his ham radio in case any of the high schoolers wanted to try to bounce a signal off the ionosphere during the commercial break, which feels magical even when you know the math. Tamara made glazes and then pretended to be outraged by the very idea of TV and then paused Astronaut Wives to watch an old clip of Sally Ride, because we are all hypocrites when someone brave is on.\n\nThat night, before sleep, the house settled like a ship in friendly water. Lark lay awake with the fan marking time and the necklace warming to the temperature of her hope. She thought about the shape of Thursday and how it could either take a piece of her or put something back. She thought about the state hearing and the panel and the woman with eyeliner and the way June had learned to cut the size of her explanations in half only to make them twice as clear. She thought, for a small, superstitious minute, about the version of herself who had stayed in a city that isn\u2019t a town and had learned to wear fear like a fashionable bracelet and then had to get it cut off in a back room with a snip that hurt anyway. This version of her had gotten a different story, one with wind and a welding mask and a beagle who barked when the world had the audacity to do something interesting near his parking spot.\n\nThe next day, June said they were going to try the thing Irene had called ugly-fast. It meant catching a yaw with intentional overcorrection before overcorrection became a cartoon. It meant letting the body\u2019s own flinch be the first part of the math and not the enemy. It meant if a part she thought she loved failed, she would let it fail loudly and replace it with something plainer and better. Lark didn\u2019t have anything to hold during that. She didn\u2019t have a flashlight or a donut or a boy to distract by asking him to carry cones. Her job was to stand at the edge of the shade and say \u201cyes\u201d with her face to all the eyes that would look up when the thing made a sound that made the town remember how anything new demands an organ. She thought of the indie film and the soup and the knives and the delicate trick of pretending to cut and not cutting, because of continuity. She thought of a sentence her mother had written in a book and how she had gotten to test the knob, not as a girl in heels at a party but as a woman in sneakers at a driveway.\n\nThe first ugly-fast scare was small, because fate is sometimes tender when it wants to train you. A cough became a hiccup became a tilt and then Sita breathed once and cut power and the object came down like a cat rolling off a couch with dignity intact. The second was less polite, rattling a bracket loose with a zing that made Eli grin like the universe had just sent him a lesson in how music is made of mistakes. June tightened the bracket and then shook her head and took it off and put on something thicker and made a note to write a thank you card to the friend who had given her the thinner bracket because gifts have their place but not all places need gifts. The third grew in grace out of stubbornness, ugly and then pretty and then genuinely itself, a balanced demand that the wind meet it halfway. Lark felt inside her chest the smallest of the sparrows that used to slam themselves against glass go, suddenly, a less frantic route to a windowsill.\n\nAfternoon brought a quiet between weather fronts, and in that quiet Denise texted a photograph, the kind agents send when they want to use the visual to get you to answer the phone. It was a shot of a billboard mocked up with two silhouettes, a rocket and a woman in a welding helmet, and across it the words THE CORWIN EFFECT in a font that tried to look expensive. Lark called before Denise could ring, the kind of preemptive strike she\u2019d learned from years of being managed lovingly. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, which she tried to cushion with breath. \u201cNo to that name, no to that possessive. It\u2019s not mine to be named after. No to the thing where the woman gets credit for being brave when what she\u2019s been is stubborn and correct. If anything gets named, the town gets a plaque, and the plaque says this street put up with this. This driveway did this. This wind was here and didn\u2019t blow us down.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Denise said, sounding not at all bruised and a little delighted, because people think agents like to win more than they like to be aligned with rightness and sometimes that isn\u2019t true. \u201cI had that made to see if you would spit it back at me. You did. Tomorrow wear the shirt with the tiny scorch mark you like and the boots that make you look like you build the things you talk about. Tell Fallon a story where even he has to be quiet for a second. I\u2019ll keep the rest safely off your day.\u201d\n\nEvening brought the pond back into their periphery because Westfield doesn\u2019t know how to be itself if you don\u2019t take its water into account. They walked there again the way you walk a word to make sure it fits in your mouth, and this time, because the world is sometimes kind in exactly the small way you require, there were no ducks close to the path. There were only soft rings of insects on the surface of the water, and a girl in a yellow dress with mud on her ankles showing her mother how Minnows Do This, and a teenage boy lying on his back on the grass with his eyes closed, using the earth on purpose. June watched the sky the way you look at someone who is going to leave you and you love them anyway. Lark watched June watch the sky and holy things, which is how adoration gets to be useful when you don\u2019t climb it up onto an altar and make it formal.\n\nOn the night of Fallon they did something that felt like it shouldn\u2019t matter and therefore mattered. They ate scrambled eggs at five in the afternoon. They used the thick bread and the sort of ketchup that pretends to be grown-up by having less sugar. They were quiet in the kind of way that doesn\u2019t come from fear but from not wanting to break the good dishes inside the hour. Irene put on lipstick and then wiped it off, applied chapstick like armor, and told Eli that if he made one face at the camera behind the camera she would assign him to coil hose for a week. Tamara kissed everyone without counting so as not to miss.\n\nThe satellite truck the network sent parked two houses down because their wheels were rude to curbs. A young person with headphones and grace set up a camera so the library and the not-yet-sculpture would both fit. The producer, who had been told about Irene and bats and consequences, shook hands like the handshake was a lease. Fallon\u2019s face appeared in a rectangle on a stand in front of them, a thin man in a suit who had been blessed with sincere eyes and a makeup artist who knew about laughing lines. He did a warmup for them the way you do when you are about to talk a group into doing something and want them to like you for it. He asked if they liked Westfield and said he\u2019d once bought a couch from their mall and was it still a mall or had the malls become hospitals yet. June said, \u201cWe like our mall like we like our dentists: we pretend to dread and then we thank it and go back every six months,\u201d and Lark could see the exact moment a person on a late-night show realized they were going to get a different kind of segment than the one they had slotted.\n\nThe questions were what they were, softened by an intern who had been given a list of what not to say and had taken it seriously. There was a joke about ducks that Lark met with a smile and a one-sentence sermon about brains and seatbelts and how we don\u2019t have to be brave in the way that looks good to strangers. There was real time for June to say out loud, on a big long string of pixels that would hit televisions and phones like rain, that she wanted to build a series of doors the town could brag about letting people walk through. Fallon did the move with his eyebrows he does when he hears a sentence he can add to his own private collection of reasons to be proud of his species. He ended by asking what they would name the rocket and June answered before anyone could turn it into a vote. \u201cI\u2019m not naming the rocket,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pet. It\u2019s a verb.\u201d\n\nThey signed off and the town clapped at a TV they could have thrown a tennis ball at if they wanted. Denise texted twenty heart emojis and a spreadsheet screenshot because balance is everything. Irene exhaled like she\u2019d been holding three forms open in her mind for the length of a pop song. Pax borrowed the headphones from the young person and listened to the station chatter like a man at church listening to an organ warm up. Ron brought over his beagle and said, \u201cHe liked it. He\u2019s a critic and he liked it,\u201d which was the kind of benediction that didn\u2019t need religion to work. Lark went outside to the driveway and stood on the scorch mark and didn\u2019t make a wish because that would have made it smaller. She just stood there and let the day pat her down for contraband and find none.\n\nWhen the house finally went quiet, the wind had given up on itself for the day and left the trees to practice stillness. Lark found June in the garage, cleaning the same small area with a rag the way you do when cleaning isn\u2019t about clean. The pendant had carved its little weight into Lark\u2019s collarbones in the way of familiarity. She touched it without theatrics and said, \u201cYou called it a verb,\u201d as if she hadn\u2019t heard the line and clapped like every other American in a soft chair.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want something I can set on a mantel,\u201d June said. \u201cI want something that argues with sky and comes home for dinner.\u201d She looked up and her eyes were so bright they were almost rude. \u201cTomorrow, wind again. Then the slow low hover, no lift, push into ugly, stay, breathe. If it keeps saying yes, then after that\u2026 I think we try the high fence. Pax says it\u2019s a bad metaphor, but I want my body to know we can clear a line that looks like the edge of permission.\u201d\n\nLark nodded, loving a new piece of vocabulary without asking where it would sit. She thought of all the fences she had not tried to clear and all the hedges she had walked around politely. She thought of ducks asleep in their one-eyed way, guarding their half-worlds. She thought of audiences invisible and visible, and which one she owed what on any given Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ll hold the light,\u201d she said, because it had become their liturgy. \u201cI\u2019ll hold it until you say stop. Then I\u2019ll put it down very gently so it doesn\u2019t remember my hand.\u201d\n\nThey turned the garage lights off together and the rocket\u2019s silhouette stayed in the room anyway, because things you make insist on being present even when you don\u2019t indulge them. In the dark June\u2019s hand found Lark\u2019s elbow for one second, the smallest of moorings, and Lark thought that maybe she could learn stars after all, not to own them or to keep them, but to call the going by something other than luck. She went to bed and didn\u2019t count ducks. She counted breaths until the night untied itself from her carefulness and pulled her under like water does when it likes you back.Chapter 7\n\nMorning arrived as if it had written itself a schedule. The sun hit the lemon tree first, then the garage door, then the rectangle on the kitchen floor that marked where someone should stand if they wanted to be bathed in something like approval. The house knew what was planned without being told. June\u2019s lists had reproduced overnight: one pinned to the chalk wall, one tucked under a magnet shaped like a chili pepper on the fridge, one written on the back of a takeout menu in a hand that had grown narrower and more impatient as the ink ran low. Irene had texted at dawn to say the air would be cooperative until lunchtime and then would go sideways in fits, like a child who had decided naps were an insult, and that if they wanted to try \u201cthe high fence\u201d they should do it while the wind was still pretending to be a citizen.\n\nIt turned out \u201cthe high fence\u201d wasn\u2019t a literal barrier so much as an agreement about height. June and Sita had rigged a line across the cul-de-sac at a cautious distance with pennants made from strips of an old caution tarp and the corners of the girls\u2019 childhood sheets. The pennants did a small bright dance in the breeze like an old-fashioned celebration trying very hard to be modern. Pax had brought sawhorses because he believed in the morale value of staging. Eli dragged the sawhorses to flank the line like bouncers who had been given a clip-and-store lecture by Irene on what to allow and what to shame. The mayor had sent two city employees whose job title was listed on their shirts as \u201cGeneral Utility,\u201d and both of them wore it the way a cape is worn when you don\u2019t want to be accused of pretending to be a hero.\n\nLark made coffee and decided to make eggs again because the eggs had been good luck. She salted them with her fingers and wiped her hands on a towel that had survived three kitchens and one fire and refused to die. The pendant rested in its place, warming against her skin as she moved, and she thought of the way June had pressed the tiny green sliver under glass like a joke and a mercy. For a long time, fear had felt like a noisy guest who refused to leave. Now, it felt like a tenant with a lease. She didn\u2019t like it, but she knew when it would pay its rent.\n\nShe walked to the garage and found June in \u201cpre-check prayer,\u201d which is what Tamara had started calling the way she moved around the machine touching, not quite touching, calling out the names of things like a mother counting heads. Sita had the torque wrench in both hands and a look on her face that said she had recently won an argument with herself and kept it. Irene sat on the stool near the whiteboard with her legs crossed and a clipboard balanced on her knee. She had drawn a small crown on the top of the page where the word \u201cwind\u201d had been written, a private joke she hadn\u2019t checked with anyone else. \u201cWe go ugly fast only if pretty fails and only once,\u201d she said without looking up. \u201cThen we don\u2019t get addicted to the drama of the save. The drama is seductive and will steal your wallet.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d June said, and then, because she knew herself and the way her hands liked to believe they could save anything, she said it again. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\nRon appeared with the beagle and a ratchet strap like a man attending to both sides of his personality at once. The strap, he informed anyone who\u2019d listen, had held a canoe on his nephew\u2019s Subaru through three seasons and one incident with megawind up by the quarry; it could hold a panel respectful if it had to. He handed it over with an eye on the pennants and an expression that said he had already rehearsed two stories to tell at the diner later: one in which nothing happened and he was gracious, one in which everything happened and he was also gracious. The beagle sniffed the chalk like it had a long-ago secret with calcium.\n\nDenise had promised not to send anyone with a lens without warning, and she kept her promise. A lens arrived anyway, the kind that floats attached to four arms and a battery and a remote operator who stood in the shade of a maple as if shade were a legal argument. The drone tried to find a lane through the trees and the pennants as though it believed in the primacy of its mission, which was to gather light and sell it. Irene spotted it in the way you spot a wasp at a picnic\u2014calm, immediate, already adjusting the food. She walked to the maple tree with the kind of authority that doesn\u2019t need to be turned up and spoke to the operator without raising her voice. Lark watched from the driveway and saw the exact moment the operator recalibrated the shape of the trouble he was in and decided to land his machine like it had been his idea to do so.\n\nWhen the cones went up, a small congregation formed of its own accord. Two teachers from the elementary school came on their planning period with coffees and the faces of women who have learned to love a well-run line. The librarian wore a denim shirt and joy. Pax\u2019s cousin\u2014who had a name that sounded like an old story, Abel\u2014leaned against his truck and looked like he was practicing how to accept responsibility for more than his share of any future that required fixing. Tamara emerged, wiped clay from the heel of her hand onto her jeans in a way no one else could do without looking performative, and tucked a scrap of hair behind her ear that had been stubborn since Santa Fe. Lark\u2019s father stood back with a towel over one shoulder like he\u2019d forgotten he wasn\u2019t in charge of a grill and would never be again.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d June said, and the word held as much bravado as it could without spilling. \u201cWe clear the line or we don\u2019t. No one gets a medal for altitude. We\u2019re collecting proofs of control. Irene calls abort; Sita calls abort; I call abort, and any one of those is the spell that gives us cake later. If Ron calls abort I\u2019ll pretend not to hear him unless he uses the voice he used on me when I was eight and decided to teach myself brakes on a dirt hill.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s mouth twitched and he considered making the face, then decided to save it for when it would be needed.\n\nThe first lift was nothing dramatic, which is to say it was perfect. The thing hung just above the driveway and considered the pennants in the same way a cat considers a glass of water\u2014interested, polite, vaguely threatening. June\u2019s hands did their quiet choreography above the throttle and the yaw control, and Irene watched the windsock and counted under her breath like numbers could be taught to hum in key. The machine inched up as if guided by a string only June could see, and the line dipped to the right as a puff of afternoon from across the park decided to register its displeasure. Sita\u2019s finger hovered, loving the possibility of a moment she wouldn\u2019t have to make.\n\nIt cleared by inches that felt like narrative. The pennants did not catch. A strip of the old sheet flapped joyously and then settled as if it had not just measured the distance between permissibility and regret. The crowd did a small collective sigh because humans are incapable of saving their breath when a thing that needs it is in the room. June\u2019s face didn\u2019t move, but something in her shoulders closed a tab. Lark had the odd sensation of the pendant cooling and heating at once, as if the tiny green thing under glass were registering the air in the room and agreeing to behave.\n\nThen the wind remembered what town it was in and performed a trick. It found a corner of the cul-de-sac where the warmth from the asphalt leaned up into the cool, which is a recipe for mischief. The machine drifted in the way a determined person drifts when questioned\u2014only slightly, with annoyance. A garbage can down the block clacked its lid at the wrong time and a child coughed and a beagle decided to issue a single bark in the language of critique. The yaw went sideways quickly, ugly the way a clever person is ugly when they are tired and think they can fake it. Sita\u2019s chin dipped; Irene\u2019s eyes changed tempo; June let herself be the quick version of her careful and tapped a correction that was more like a flick than a push. The thing shuddered and shook out the anger and righted. Later, everyone who had been there would describe it differently and use their hands. In the moment, Lark registered it as a feeling you remember from a particular childhood fall: when your knee met gravel and you didn\u2019t go down because your body found a way to say, not today.\n\nThey settled, did a checklist with the gravity of a prayer in a language nobody begrudges, and brought it down. People clapped in that way communities clap when they\u2019ve agreed not to name what they\u2019re praising because naming would make it smaller. Pax let out a yelp and then apologized to Irene for volume in a school zone; Irene said he could yell twice more as long as one of the yells was in metric. Ron exhaled like a tractor turning off. Eli\u2019s hands vibrated in sympathy with the fans; Sita handed him a thing to hold that felt important so he would stop vibrating. Lark realized she was crying and let her face do it without the magazine version of the motion, because nobody had cameras but the kind you carry under your ribs.\n\nThey reset for a second try because no one knows how to quit when the day is this willing. During the setup, a woman who owned the hair salon on Main\u2014the one that still had a photo of a 1998 prom cluster in the front window\u2014sidled up to Lark and touched her elbow and said, \u201cYou made me laugh on the TV last night and then I cried because I thought about the way I used to hold my breath in church and I think I finally stopped. If you need the back room of the salon to keep your things that boys with papers want to photograph, tell me. I can put it next to the perm rods. They\u2019ll never look there.\u201d She smiled with a mouth that had fixed a thousand people for a thousand weddings and meant it.\n\nThe drone operator came back without the drone, hands in his pockets like he had learned to be on the side of humans. He apologized to Irene without sounding sorry he\u2019d been caught, and asked if he could stand by the cones and just watch if he promised not to turn anything on. Irene gave him a look that could tune engines and then said, \u201cYou can stand by Pax. He will tell you about meters. If you say the phrase \u2018content verticals\u2019 near my cones I will give you a math test.\u201d He stood by Pax and learned to nod on the beat.\n\nThe second lift was the one that tried to take their good will and turn it into hubris. June knew it as it happened, the way you recognize an old friend from far away and also recognize that their current mood will require you to stop them from making a speech. The machine rose and flirted with the line, then tipped its shoulder with a kind of swagger it had not been given permission to try. The correction that would serve pretty was past. Ugly-fast beckoned: the decisive, unlovely, extremely human move that says we mean to continue. June chose it before the invitation was fully written. She turned the control with a firmness that would have insulted someone who didn\u2019t want to be told what to do and the machine obeyed in the way obedient things obey when they trust the voice that asks. The clearance was not handsome. It was effective. Pennants snapped into shape and then fell, chastened. The town cheered less loud this time because it had learned that sometimes the best applause is the sound you don\u2019t make when the person you love is doing something delicate.\n\nThey brought it down and June sat, which she doesn\u2019t do if she can help it. Tamara pressed a bottle of water into her hand and then touched the back of her head like checking for fever. Irene put a finger on the line of June\u2019s wrist for a pulse and then pretended to be interested in a bolt so June wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed by the intimacy. Lark sat on the curb because she needed to and the curb did what curbs do for people who have sat on them in many versions of their lives: it made a kind of sense.\n\nThat afternoon, while the tools cooled and the windsock made up its mind and the town found its chores again, the indie film called and asked for Lark at dusk on a porch with a screen door, the kind of porch that keeps secrets by creaking. Mara said the daylight had gone flimsier earlier than expected and they wanted to steal a scene while the sky knew how to keep its blue. Lark said yes to the stealing because it meant she could say no to something else later with the coin she\u2019d earned, and because her days were now stitched out of choices that felt less like averting punishment and more like leaning toward usefulness. She drove there with June\u2019s voice in her pocket saying things like \u201ctorque path\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t let pretty fool you,\u201d and she used those phrases on a paragraph that wanted to be too clean. The scene snapped into focus because she let herself say a line badly on purpose before she said it right, and Mara\u2019s face did the grateful thing it did when someone trusted her enough to risk being seen with their mask half down.\n\nWhen she returned, the house smelled like oranges and something that could have been sorrow if you weren\u2019t careful. Her father had fallen asleep in the chair in the back room, his head tipped, the towel still on his shoulder like a friend. The radio hummed in the background with a public voice discussing drought plans in a tone like a bedtime story. There was a short list on the end table written in his hand\u2014eggs, mulch, call dentist\u2014that had a blank space in the middle where something had been meant to go. Lark stared at the blank and felt the cold reach that certain omissions perform. She put her finger in the space and said the names of things that might fit in a voice that could be mistaken for reading out loud to herself: batteries, beans, June. He woke without alarm, smiled, and said, as if picking up a conversation they had always had, \u201cI always forget batter, not eggs,\u201d and she let it slide because mercy sometimes means keeping a full back pocket of illusions within arm\u2019s reach.\n\nLater, over bowls of something Tamara called stew and June called fuel, Irene told a story in the low, matter-of-fact voice she only used when she wanted to offer herself up as a reason and not a standard. In Mojave there had been a day when wind had gone from idea to person, and a friend had tried to show it what kind of person he was. He had not been stupid, he had been sincere. He had carried calculation in his mouth and faith in his flinch and he had lost anyway, not his life, not that story, but a capacity for arrogance that he had not believed he possessed. \u201cHe is gentler now,\u201d she said, which is a sentence that includes an elegy the way a stream includes the idea of rocks. \u201cHe builds less tall and more wide, and he lets the second idea be a long time coming. We are not those people and I am not asking us to be them. I am asking us to tell the truth to our own trouble before someone else\u2019s trouble hears us lying and tries to teach us a lesson.\u201d\n\nJune listened the way she listens to forms\u2014pen ready, eyes kind. \u201cTomorrow no height,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do discipline school. We do ugly on a leash until ugly stops pretending it knows better than me. We do torque again with a friend looking over my shoulder so I don\u2019t become one of those cautionary fonts on a flyer.\u201d\n\nThe docuseries producer sent an email with softened edges and the phrase \u201cwe want to honor your boundaries.\u201d Denise replied with a paragraph that was polite and covered in tiny blades and included three non-negotiables and a line about tune-in times that used the word \u201cadjacency\u201d like a loaded pistol. It would be ridiculous if it weren\u2019t also an act of protection. Lark forwarded the email to June who wrote back, a minute later, \u201cI wish your work didn\u2019t have to be this. I am grateful that your work is this.\u201d Lark stared at the sentence for longer than the screen needed and then turned her phone over and let it be a face-down insect on the table.\n\nThe town\u2019s high school invited June and Lark to speak in the auditorium that had hosted too many assemblies about vaping and not enough about propulsion. The principal wrote an email that sounded like an apology for the fluorescent lights and the way kids now are always tired and asking for accommodations like joy. They went, because saying yes to the kids is the only yes that should outrank safety and sleep. In the auditorium, the microphone made its small betrayal squeal and the teenagers made their larger, more merciful one, which is to be more generous than anyone expects as long as you don\u2019t tell them they\u2019re being generous. June brought a bolt and a bracket and held them up and said, \u201cThis holds because these threads agree to hold and because I don\u2019t lie to them about their job,\u201d and three kids in the third row sat forward like they had heard their own names. Lark told the knife-and-soup story because it had become the true thing she could tell without folding in on herself, and at the end a girl with the beginnings of a mustache and the ending of her patience raised her hand and said, \u201cSo you were afraid of ducks, like for real, and you didn\u2019t fix it but you did something else,\u201d and when Lark said yes, there was an audible feeling in the room, not quite a sigh, not quite a laugh. It sounded like permission granted without a ceremony.\n\nOn their way out, a boy with two different sneakers and a shy phone asked to take a picture. He held the phone up as if to trap them and then lowered it slowly instead. \u201cI want to remember you with my eyes,\u201d he said, mortified by his own sincerity, and then he ran away. Irene, who had come along to count fire exits and columns, laughed as if a bee had politely refused to sting her and said, \u201cTown is making itself a very weird church.\u201d\n\nThe weather rolled a bruise across the sky one morning and the texts started: are you doing it anyway, did you see the radar, is this a sign, should I bring my aunt who loves storms. June sent back a small, clean no and then a longer explanation about electricity and luck and how the cost of a day can be measured in two currencies and how she refused to go broke in either. Ron wrote \u201cgood call\u201d under her post on the WESTFIELD REAL TALK group and three men with the word \u201creal\u201d in their profile names argued about whether caution was a plot. Pax posted a photograph of the windsock lying reproachfully on the grass like an exhausted fish with the caption, \u201ctomorrow,\u201d and people clicked little hearts because hope is the internet\u2019s only real use.\n\nOn a day when the sky decided to be hospitable and June\u2019s list had been satisfied with three checkmarks and a small offering of sweat, the high fence became the low fence and then no fence at all. They took the pennants down, because sometimes the presence of the obstacle makes you hit the obstacle on principle. June announced that she had a new favorite thing to say: \u201cweight growth budget,\u201d which meant she was allowed to add a pound of wiring and a handful of caution and still be within the promise she\u2019d made herself when she decided she wouldn\u2019t let the machine become a sculpture too soon. Lark thought about the phrase like an allegory she could try on her life and then put back on the hook for return later.\n\nAfter dinner, Tamara invited everyone to the studio again because clay had become her weather. She unveiled the angry vase from Santa Fe and placed it on a table and then a taller, more complicated vessel she had made since, glazed in a color that could not decide whether it was pond or sky. \u201cI told my class,\u201d she said, wiping her hands on a towel that had known intimately the idea of grit, \u201cthat we make containers for what we can\u2019t hold, and if we are lucky the thing we couldn\u2019t hold finds a shape that looks like itself, and we discover we can hold it after all.\u201d She put the vase and the vessel side by side, let them look at one another the way siblings look when the adults leave the room, and then slipped her arm through both of the girls\u2019 unwilling elbows and held on.\n\nLate that week, the production company with the tasteful access wrote back agreeing, unbelievably, to every demand with four caveats that Denise sent back capped with four no\u2019s and two alternate suggestions and a budget revision that somehow made numbers feel like a language for covenants instead of tricks. Irene had the last word, which was not like her, and the word was \u201cpilot only,\u201d because she did not believe in seasons in life or television until she had evidence for them. June drew a small box on the chalkboard and wrote inside it: only if we still get to say stop. Pax brought over an old red light from a theater junk sale and mounted it on a post near the garage door. If they flicked it on, it meant the crew, any crew, was a no. If it wasn\u2019t lit, it still could be a no. \u201cSometimes I like you best when you are predictable about being complicated,\u201d Lark told her sister, who bowed then, ironically, to the red light like it had asked for her autograph.\n\nThat Saturday, the town woke ready to spend its attention. The farmers market put out early strawberries that tasted like effort. The cafe set up a table outside with a sign that said \u201cRocket Fuel\u201d in chalk and then in parentheses \u201ccoffee, we mean coffee.\u201d A band with a banjo practiced two doors down and then practiced again with less banjo. The high fence day without fence had settled into their bones as a story they could tell in either direction\u2014\u201cremember when we almost\u201d and \u201cremember when we did.\u201d Lark walked past the pond with Tamara who had decided to count the turtles like a researcher one might pay if one were interested in the daily complicities of suburban wildlife. A small boy stood on the low bridge with a slice of bread his mother had given him because she had not read the sign, and Lark, trying not to make anything more dramatic than it needed to be, stood with them and used her movie voice, the soft one that makes people lean in, to say, \u201cYou see how they\u2019re pretending to be hungry for bread but really they need bugs and green stuff and things that wiggle. They\u2019ll take that bread and say thank you and then their bodies will be confused and sad. It\u2019s a weird trick we learned to play on them. What if we tricked them in the other direction and threw peas?\u201d The mother looked at the sign and then at Lark and made a face like she\u2019d been caught but was grateful. The boy whispered \u201cpeas\u201d as if it were a secret password. Tamara said, \u201cI have peas,\u201d because of course she did, and the three of them stood there flicking green coins and being thanked by a rush of water and small beaks. When they walked away, a teenage couple took their place, and the girl said, \u201cYou know who that was,\u201d and the boy said, \u201cSomeone nice,\u201d and for once that was the answer.\n\nIn the late light of Sunday, June brought the machine out for what she insisted was not a test and Irene called \u201ca behavioral exercise\u201d and Pax called \u201cchurch,\u201d which the mayor tried once to second and then withdrew because she did not want to irritate constituents. They practiced hovering low until Irene could look away for a full three breaths without thinking she would be punished by a coincidence. They mapped the effect of a bicycle passing at speed two streets over because there is no such thing as too much superstition that can be measured. Eli asked if he could hold the anemometer without the broom and Irene let him, watching him watch numbers become wind, which is a small sort of alchemy you want young people to believe in before anyone tells them it isn\u2019t real.\n\nJust as they were putting it away, a car from a paper two counties over pulled up and a woman in a linen jacket with proper shoes stepped out with a notebook like a minority religion. She asked if she could ask three questions and then asked two very good ones and one that made Lark want to laugh. \u201cWhat do you want it to feel like when you leave the ground,\u201d the woman asked June, and June considered the floor as if thinking happened there and then answered, \u201cI want it to feel like the first time you say a word you\u2019ve only ever read.\u201d The woman nodded like she had come for that sentence and got in her car and left, taking it away to put on a page where strangers could read it and feel less alone without knowing why.\n\nThat night, the ducks were neither villains nor symbols, just small green heads under a satin black that had sewn itself over the pond. Lark lay in her bed and listened to the compressor in the fridge do its little complaint, to the far train rehearse its loneliest syllable, to the wind in the maple tell a story in a dialect it had picked up out west and brought home. She thought of the fence and the line and the way permission can be a set of pennants you put up yourself and then have the audacity to clear anyway. She touched the glass dome on the pendant with the skitter of her fingernail and felt the duck decoy heart and the rocket skin steady under it, private and offered at once. She promised herself, without ceremony and without witnesses, that she would keep repositioning her fear toward useful norths and would hold the light until her arms trembled and then hand it carefully to Eli or Irene or the boy with the eyebrows or anyone whose fingers hadn\u2019t yet gotten their chance to ache from holding. In the morning, June would wake up with a solution to a problem that had not introduced itself and would treat it like an expected guest. In the morning, Denise would send a text with a calendar and a joke. In the morning, the town would open its eyes and ask, as all towns do, for something to point at with pride. For now, night took its job back and did not fail them.\n\nThe next week wrote itself future and then asked them to fill it in. Monday brought a man in a suit that fit him like an argument, who wanted to invest in June\u2019s verb because his fund had a hole in the shape of modern hope. He spoke kindly and too fast and watched June\u2019s hands as if her fingers made money by virtue of moving. June gave him water in a mason jar and used words like \u201cno\u201d and \u201clater\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d in a way that made the jar sweat. Lark sat in the doorway and learned the grammar of defense that has no trace of bitterness in it, only line-drawing. Tuesday brought a thirty-minute segment on the local radio with Pax where callers asked if the rocket could be used for charcuterie delivery (no), for emergency hearts (maybe someday), for mail (stop). Wednesday brought an email from the state that had a kind tone and the word \u201cpermit\u201d spelled correctly throughout, which made Irene clap exactly once. Thursday brought nothing but weather and work and the relief of a day no one wanted to write a sentence about later.\n\nOn Friday, they tried ugly-fast on uneven ground because Irene had written the sentence \u201clife is not the driveway\u201d on the board and underlined it like a threat and a wish. They rolled to the park\u2019s edge where the grass made a poor case for itself and the ground undulated as if it had inherited some opinion from the creek. The windsock took up a position like a judge. Sita rigged the new, heavier bracket and tapped it with her wrench like she was listening to a sleeping thing\u2019s chest. Eli marked out a perimeter that seemed too large until the wind bunched itself and decided to make a point. Kids from the elementary school hung on the fence, small faces made of breath and summer and opinions. Irene explained, loudly enough for all of them to pretend not to hear, what a soft abort looks like and what men in old movies got wrong about the difference between daring and flirting with hospitals. June adjusted her stance in a way that made Lark think of a girl at the top of a diving board who taught herself to let her heels kiss the wood hello before she jumped.\n\nThe machine did what it does when it is watched by children. It behaved nearly perfectly and then failed in a small, teachable way. A gust did a mean thing and then pretended innocence. The correction June chose was decent and would have been enough at home. The grass under the right front foot turned out to be damp from a sprinkler that somebody had forgotten to turn off, and damp grass made a liar of friction. The strange beauty of it was how the failure drew every person present into a single body for a beat. Sita\u2019s hand moved. Irene\u2019s voice said, \u201cnow.\u201d June\u2019s jaw set. Eli took a step forward like an offering and then back like a good boy. Lark felt her fear try to stand on the chair, and she told it to sit down. The machine kissed the ground where it should not, and a panel skittered with a sound like someone pushing a baking sheet across tile. A boy whispered \u201ccool,\u201d reverent and bad, and his mother put a hand on his head without looking at him because she had learned gentleness was the leash that made some forms of awe behave.\n\nNothing exploded. Nothing smoldered. The bracket did not embarrass itself. The failure was the kind you can hold in your hands and assign homework to. June crouched, forehead briefly to the machine\u2019s side as if listening for a heartbeat, then looked up and said, \u201cI owe you all a better philosophy of grass,\u201d and the kids inched closer because she had said the kind of sentence that turns into a pull quote on posters in rooms where adults hope children will feel something they are not yet cynical about.\n\nThat evening, the pond had a kind of light on it that made everyone speak in sentences that included the words \u201cremember\u201d and \u201calways\u201d and were not entirely accurate but nobody cared. A pair of geese did a sloppy parade with babies who were impossible to hate, and a turtle made a case for the superiority of turtles by doing nothing and still being applauded by a toddler. Lark and June walked the path slow, not because of fear but because speed had become a tool, something not to be spent casually. Behind them, the town tried on a future where the library lawn had a sculpture that could, at certain times, be a door. In front of them, a boy on a bike practiced riding no-hands and then caught himself with a laugh that suggested he\u2019d decided the ground was a friend. Above them, a big lazy V of birds made a letter across the early dark. Lark looked up and thought, with a sudden consistent joy, that she might finally do what she\u2019d promised herself on a night near sleep\u2014that she might learn the names, not to own them but to hold the going in her mouth, to taste the truth of it. She would start with Vega and Altair, teach herself that the Swan was a story and not a dare, steel herself against the unfortunate name of the star in the tail that she would refuse to say in front of Tamara without a warning. She would join Irene under a certain winter sky and be taught what edges mean at different times of year. She would hold the light, and when her arms tired, she would say so. She would stop when stop was holy, and she would go when go was a verb that made all the right noise.\n\nThe next morning would be letters with agreements and a grocery run where a stranger would buy her strawberries because her niece had squealed when the rocket cleared the line and that squeal had reached his old heart and done a neat repair. It would be a phone call with Denise about a shoot in a field that would be actually a field with ticks and they would say no to the ticks and yes to the field on a different day. It would be Jo from the salon putting a note on her mirror that said NO DIFFUSERS ON LAUNCH DAYS because the noise spooked the ancient dog under the desk. It would be Tamara glazing something with stars and pretending it was an accident. It would be the high fence taken down and the marks on the driveway beginning to look like a map you could learn, not to travel exactly, but to point at when someone younger asked you how to get there.\n\nThey would go to the state and get a sternness and a permission. They would make a thing that rose, then stayed, then came down. They would set plates and wash them. They would read the notes from the internet and not die. They would walk to the pond and see what it offered. They would not invite miracles and they would accept them anyway, in the form of bolts that chose to stay home and wind that chose to be polite and ducks that chose that day to be more rock than bird. They would remember how to be a person in a room while a machine warms the air. They would be sisters in the first and truest sense: two people who throw their attention toward the same corner every morning and find a way, with hands and vowels, to keep it steady.Chapter 10\n\nThe docuseries pilot arrived on a Wednesday that had the nerve to be ordinary. The crew came in a white van that smelled faintly of yogurt and ambition, and they carried cases that made the neighbors look up the way they used to when someone rolled a piano into a parlor. Denise had written a little manifesto the week before\u2014three pages, short paragraphs, no exclamation points\u2014and the producer read it like a person learning the rules to a game he did not believe would be fun. The red light Pax had mounted near the garage door glowed until Irene nodded twice, and when it clicked off the room felt taller, as if permission added headroom. \u201cWe keep the wires out of the pond,\u201d June said by way of welcome, and the sound guy did a small defensive shrug like he had interfered with water before and had learned nothing useful.\n\nLark knew how to do this part so well it made her teeth ache. She stood where they asked and then stood where she asked and kept her voice in the register that turns strangers into participants. The camera wanted her face to break at certain times, and she disappointed it by breaking her face at others. The producer tried to write a scene in which a duck, adorable and problematic, would glide through the frame at the exact moment June used the word thrust, and Irene intercepted the outline with a smile that had the weight of road salt. \u201cWe don\u2019t bait wildlife,\u201d she said without raising anything but the temperature of the silence, and the producer made a little motion with his hand as if swatting a thought. They filmed anyway, without the duck, and it turned out to be a better scene: June naming bolts like saints, Sita laughing with her whole collarbone, Pax demonstrating with two donuts how yaw can pretend to be your friend.\n\nThe week organized itself around a bright circle on the calendar called HOP 6 in Irene\u2019s careful print. It would be the first one with a temporary flight restriction over Westfield, a phrase that made old men at the diner sit up straighter and count planes out the window just to feel useful. Irene handled the paperwork like a person carrying a cake through a kitchen where children have been invited to participate; she kept one elbow high and the other low and never moved faster than a brisk kindness. The mayor learned how to say NOTAM without turning it into a joke, which is harder than it sounds. Pax ran comms to the hobby airport fifteen miles away where men in foam-capped hangars called their wives to say, \u201cYou will not believe what America is doing in a cul-de-sac.\u201d\n\nJune finished Block B with a tenderness that scared her a little. The heavier bracket had been given a ceremony consisting of a torque wrench, two witnesses, and a joke about dowries. She had added three sensors that would tell her what the belly felt when ugliness visited and had run wires so clean and labeled so politely that Irene took a photograph for her secret album of competence. There was a new vent that June described as \u201ca door for hot spirits,\u201d which made the librarian blush and the high schoolers draw ghosts on the chalkboard. Sita found a hairline crack in a fitting and refused to let it be a metaphor; she replaced it, put the cracked one on a shelf like a lesson, and told June that they were not building an altar.\n\nLark\u2019s film answered the festival question with a yes that had garnish. The program would premiere at dusk under an awning made of college money in a town that thought it had invented independent thought, and the director texted a photo of paper lanterns like captured moons. Denise already had a dress delivered, something that understood shoulders, and a little case of pins for hair that would make her look like she had been blessed by a careful wind. The problem was not the dress; the problem was that HOP 6 had the same hunger for that dusk. June said she could move the hop an hour earlier and Lark said she could drive fast and Mara said she could hold the monologue until the last possible breath, and Irene said, in the way of a woman who has been assigned to save people from themselves, \u201cPick the one you will not resent.\u201d Lark told the dress to wait, told the pins to forgive her, and told the lanterns she would visit them in a different life.\n\nThe day before HOP 6, Tamara\u2019s angry vase cracked with a sound that had been promised to clay and not to the people in the kitchen. She had set it near the sink because even artists forget themselves, and the faucet did that overreach it had been doing for a month, the one that Lark\u2019s father kept promising to fix. The crack was thin and clever and, as Tamara held the vase in both hands and breathed out slow, it traveled like an idea that wants to be caught saying it deserves to exist. \u201cIt was always going to do that,\u201d she said, not angry at all now, and put her thumb along the new line as if it were a seam in a dress she meant to be taken in. \u201cI can make it purposeful if I want. I can fill the fault with gold and then charge sad strangers for feeling seen.\u201d June kissed the ridge of her knuckle in an absent-minded way and then made a note in her head about pressure and the way you cannot ask water, fire, or attention to be less themselves.\n\nHer father wandered that night, not far and not dangerously, but he opened the back door and went out without his shoes and walked until the grass asked his soft feet to consider memory as a different country. Lark found him by the lemon tree, standing with his hands open as if rain had been promised. He wore the towel over his shoulder and had a spoon in his hand for no reason the world could discern. She got him back inside by asking him if the bees would like to sleep in the kitchen tonight, which he thought was funny in a way that rearranged him into the man he had been last year, and they stood for a minute with their foreheads leaned against the cool of the refrigerator. He said, \u201cYou were a good baby. You slept with your fists like you were guarding jokes,\u201d and she didn\u2019t tell him she had never slept that way because she didn\u2019t want to lose the picture he had drawn.\n\nHOP 6 morning was one of those midwestern compromises: the air promised civility and the wind promised nothing beyond appearing occasionally and keeping things from becoming too easy. Irene had real firefighters on hand this time, not because she didn\u2019t trust Pax\u2019s hoses or Ron\u2019s beagle to sense hubris, but because she believed in telling luck she\u2019d done what she could. The TFR went live five minutes before they rolled the machine out of the garage, and somewhere a man in a small plane peered at his panel and felt important for obeying a rule you could explain to a twelve-year-old. The docuseries crew, chastened by the red light\u2019s earlier theology, kept their distance and filmed feet and hands and the back of Irene\u2019s head because something in them had learned, briefly, how to love the edges of action.\n\nA surprise presented itself in the sensible way surprises do around towns with ponds. Migration had ignored the calendar by a day. A line of geese like a lazy necklace had draped itself along the far end of the cul-de-sac, heads down in a way that meant both food and disinterest. They were not on the field of play; they were not even interested in the cones; they simply existed at the exact intersection of intention and liability. Irene pulled her lower lip into her mouth and chewed a principle. Pax muttered to the windsock as if it could endorse a delay. June looked at the line of gray and green and made her face do nothing. Lark walked to the mayor\u2019s office in her rib cage and convened something that did not involve votes or donuts.\n\nThey postponed and the town absorbed it like a harmless winter. Boys on bikes made loops with extra gravity so their feelings would not fly out. The mayor apologized to a retired man who needed to be apologized to in order to tell a good story later, and he nodded and was gracious both in the telling and the being. The salon owner showed up with peas in a bag that had once been full of Sinatra records and handed them out like communion. Mothers showed their sons how to toss them not like stones but like small gifts; fathers, grudging and tender, followed suit. The geese accepted and shuffled and then, resigned to the rude generosity of it, chose another corner of their day. Ron stood with his hands in his pockets and made himself not say what he could have said about birds and men and respect.\n\nThe hop itself carried a new kind of quiet. The town had already spent its first sigh; no one wanted to give the second away. June cycled through checklists in a tone she used for bedtime stories when her goddaughter visited, and Sita\u2019s finger floated like a promise she wanted to keep. The machine rose, and for once it did so without ceremony\u2014a sensible lever drawn, a reasonable answer returned. It cleared the invisible fence Irene had drawn with geometry and pencils, and held. Under the belly, air remembered how to agree with itself faster. The yaw twitch came, then passed, and June didn\u2019t let her pride reach for it like a bad snack.\n\nHalfway through, failure entered its name on the register with a polite cough. A minor oscillation on a vector June had believed she had charmed made the right-paneled world flicker. Sita said \u201cnow\u201d in a voice that held both fear and habit, and June flicked the ugly-fast she had trained for without letting it become a sermon. The vent did what a door does for breath when a room is crowded. Heat that would have pretended anger simply left and made new friends upward. The machine settled with a certainty it had not yet owned, and the pennants that had been rolled and hidden in a bin rustled as if remembering old work.\n\nThere was a small fire, because complexities insist on finishing their thought. It happened two feet to the left of any human foot and on a scrap of grass already resigned to its own existence. Pax was halfway there before Irene would have had to say a thing, and the hiss of foam made everyone think of holidays in other countries. A child said \u201ccool\u201d again in the precise tone of a person in training for awe, and his mother chose to let him be right without telling him what could have been. June sat on the ground the way you sit when you intend for the ground to forgive you, not because you did anything unforgivable, but because you believe in good relations.\n\nApplause happened, but it wasn\u2019t loud. It moved through the group like a hand over a blanket, smoothing. People nodded as if they had come to the end of a particularly satisfying sentence and were afraid to ruin the cadence with what came next. The docuseries camera caught two seconds of true happiness on June\u2019s mouth and then lost it because true happiness isn\u2019t trained to hit its mark. Lark went to her, not to lift her up or to be lifted, but to be at the exact place where relief looks out over the next field. They didn\u2019t say anything good enough for quotable, which is what made it perfect.\n\nThe email from the festival sat like an egg until dusk, and then it cracked in Lark\u2019s pocket. Mara sent a picture of a paper lantern that did not need her face; it needed strangers and it had found them. Denise texted a photo of the dress hanging from the top of a door and said, \u201cI know, don\u2019t worry, we will give it a different night,\u201d and for once she meant it without experienced sarcasm. Lark stood on the scorch mark and let the pendant learn her heartbeat again. The green sliver under glass caught the last yellow in the trees and became briefly the kind of hope you can carry without resenting its weight.\n\nThat night the house tasted like oranges and hose water and the power of not being filmed. Tamara taped the crack in the vase in an X not because it would help but because human hands like to do something visible when they are agreeing in private. Irene opened her laptop and wrote a letter to a person at a desk with a title, and the sentences arranged themselves in the tone of a favor owed and a favor paid. Sita fell asleep on the couch like a soldier in peacetime, and Eli wrote \u201cugly-fast\u201d in the margins of his math worksheet and knew, because he had been given permission by adults who know better, that he would get away with it.\n\nTrouble came in a smaller costume the next morning and knocked, polite and irritating. The docuseries producer wanted a pickup shot in which Lark looked at the pond from a distance and thought something, anything, that would cut well with a voice-over he had already recorded about fear being a horizon. Denise had not protected against pickup shots because you cannot protect against everything, and Irene was at the county offices trying to keep a form from learning to duplicate itself in a drawer. June said she could be the one to look and think, and the producer laughed in that way that tries to make insult a social event. Lark told him no so quickly and so kindly that he forgot what he had been about to say about sunlight.\n\nShe went to the pond anyway, as one goes to see a person after telling someone else they do not get to see that person. Westfield gave her the usuals: a jogger with a backpack full of reasons, a woman practicing tai chi with the sort of sincerity that erases embarrassment from the air, a fathers-and-strollers alliance that made everyone\u2019s genes feel seen. She stood by the sign about bread and watched a line of mallards write a sentence on the water no one could translate. The fear touched her shoulder and then did that thing where it went to sit down without drama, and she reached up and touched the glass dome the way a person touches a proof they don\u2019t need to show anyone else to believe.\n\nOn the way back, she saw Ron in his driveway teaching his beagle to sit on command and the beagle teaching him what command meant under certain philosophies. He waved her over without the clipboard like a man who had taken a chance on someone else\u2019s verbs and found it tasted better than he had expected. He showed her his wheel well where the dent from wind school now had a scar like a smile that had decided to stick around. He said, \u201cI told my nephew this week he doesn\u2019t get to call himself a man just because he has opinions and access to a truck. He has to build something or keep quiet while somebody else does. He will probably go on the internet and call me names. I will tell him to come over and I\u2019ll feed him pie.\u201d Lark told him she believed in his plan like it was physics.\n\nThe hearing at the state capitol came and went with fewer theatrics than the town had expected and more difficulty than June had hoped. The panel wanted to know about birds again because birds are a convenient method for people to name their vague wholesomeness. Irene brought charts and a photograph of the windsock looking saintly and explained that the birds were not the stakeholders the state imagined them to be, at least in this case, in this place, at these times, with these protections. June spoke about flame trenches as if she were discussing manners at a table set for cousins, and a man with a chin tried to trap her in a sentence about ambition and she changed the tense on him before he could finish. Lark watched a woman in the second row whose job title did not fit on the placard, and when that woman leaned forward, Lark leaned forward, and the signal went back and forth between two people who had no intention of being photographed that day.\n\nThey returned to banners on Main Street not for them but for a chili cook-off that had been scheduled for the same Saturday because towns are always doing too much in the same place and pretending they meant to. Pax entered with a recipe called Throttle and the mayor\u2019s husband burned his onions and swore in the church parking lot. Denise came wearing sneakers and no makeup and bought three jars of jam from a woman who had never been to Los Angeles and had decided she did not like it anyway. Tamara\u2019s studio opened its door, and she hung the cracked vase with gold like a confession on the north wall where the light made it less about an apology and more about a map.\n\nThat evening there was a meteor shower that had not consulted Westfield before scheduling itself. Irene dragged a telescope from her trunk like a magician learning to carry her own hat, and she showed the kids Vega and Deneb and the long arm of the Andromeda as if she were introducing them to cousins who would always pick them up at the airport. Lark lay on the driveway with a cushion and a blanket that had once been an animal and learned to pick out the Swan and refuse, privately, to call its tail by the name she disliked. June lay beside her without speaking because sometimes gratitude ruins itself when narrated. A meteor scratched a brilliant mistake across the roof of their night and nobody made a wish because wishes are lazy and they\u2019d done the paperwork.\n\nSometime after midnight, after the last teenager had been persuaded by an aunt to go home and the last jar of chili pride had been absorbed back into the body of Westfield, an email came in from a woman who signed nothing and owned nothing but her voice. She wrote that she had watched the segment on television with an old cat in her lap, and that she had changed the lightbulb on her porch last week while crying, and that she had been waiting to read a story in which a woman chose to stay in a town instead of leaving it for a prize and did not get punished by fate or patriarchy. She wrote that ducks are stupid and sweet and that she used to count sparrows between the minutes of her husband\u2019s breathing. She ended by saying, \u201cI have been taught that fear is a kind of rudeness I should correct with better manners, and it is such a relief to be told it is a coordinate.\u201d Lark closed her eyes after she read it, not to sleep, but because sometimes the body wants to agree in darkness.\n\nThe next morning the rocket wanted something small and obnoxious and refused to be elegant about asking. June scowled at a junction that had once behaved and decided to misbehave, and she tapped it with a wrench that had known her hand long enough to be a friend. Sita handed her a different size of the same and then a different material entirely because this is how love behaves among people who build things: you keep offering alternatives until the stubbornness finds itself alone. Irene made tea and pretended to discuss air speed with Pax while listening for a sound only she can hear, the sound a day makes when it is deciding whether to be the kind that lends itself to a chapter or to a grocery list.\n\nThey did not lift that day because not lifting is a skill that needs exercise. Instead, June and Lark and Tamara and the father and Irene and Pax and Sita and Eli and the beagle went down to the pond for twenty minutes without changing their clothes to town clothes. They fed peas like they were paying a tithe to the gods of unremarkable comfort. The ducks came and pretended to deserve it and did not look at anyone particularly. A boy in a superhero t-shirt leaned against a railing too much and learned, gently, the difference between almost and sooner. Lark heard a train and said the syllable out loud because it has become a family joke that the train owes them rent, and June laughed and leaned her head on Lark\u2019s shoulder in the kind of way that means the day is going to be fine.\n\nIn the afternoon, Westfield\u2019s high school had a power outage and the principal texted to ask if the library could host two classes with good behavior and one with a track record like weather. The librarian said yes because that is the librarian\u2019s religion, and Lark came to read out loud because it turns out fame is just a permission slip that lets you do the work you wanted to do when you were nine. She read them the story about the bus and the word OUT OF SERVICE and did not tell them it was her because sometimes the room is better off thinking it\u2019s about anybody. When she finished, a boy asked if the rocket would go to Mars and June, who had come to fix a chair in the reading corner, said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to Westfield,\u201d and the boy made a face and then, after a second, did not.\n\nBy sunset, the docuseries producer had learned to bring seltzer and to sit on the steps and to keep his phrases in his mouth until they had matured. He asked June if he could mic the machine and June said yes in a way that made it clear microphones were not to be glued, dangled, or treated like solutions. He asked Lark if she\u2019d say the sentence again about fear and seatbelts, and she said she would not because truth refuses repetition on certain days. He asked Irene for a quote about liability and she told him about a boy she\u2019d known who learned to use his hands without hurting people, and he looked disappointed at the lack of an acronym. They filmed the beagle yawning and forgot to roll on the moment the windsock nodded like a friend you will lose.\n\nHOP 7 landed on a Monday because fate likes to remind you you are mortal in the least poetic parts of the week. The wind was nothing, a rumor. The geese had moved. The paperwork smelled faintly of ink and triumph. June tied her hair back in the blunt braids that make engines feel calm. Sita checked the bracket, kissed her teeth, and pretended to threaten it with a hammer. Irene ran a fingertip along a seam that had once worried her and was now just part of the family. Lark stood at the edge with her mouth full of a speech she planned not to need.\n\nIt rose. It hovered. It sloped its shoulder toward a joke and then took the joke back. It bought the town one more story it could tell with the word \u201cwe.\u201d The beagle did not bark; the boy did. The windsock made a convincing case for dignity. The machine came down, and June laughed from somewhere in her lungs that no one had touched since she was a teenager falling asleep on a trampoline under satellites we used to think were stars. The crew caught the laugh because luck owed them one. The town let itself clap with both hands and no pockets.\n\nAfterward, when everyone was full of relief and committed to chili, June pulled Lark aside with a look that belonged to eleven-year-old June with a paper airplane that had gone too far and not far enough. \u201cNext month Irene says we can try a long pause at top of arc, not long-long, but time enough for a person to know they have become a person with a different view,\u201d she said, voice steady like a danger line written in chalk. \u201cI am not asking you to come because of cameras or because the town needs to see your mouth behaving. I am asking you to come because I want you there when I teach my body a new yes.\u201d Lark did not answer with a speech because a speech would only steal the electricity from the wire. She said, \u201cI will hold the light,\u201d and the little green sliver under glass seemed to thank them both for remembering what kind of story they had chosen.",

                              "content": "The morning the photo hit all the feeds, Lark woke with the sound of a duck in her ear.\n\nNot an actual duck, but that wetly polite quack that sounds like a throat clearing. The kind that slides in under a door no matter how many pillows stack against it. She\u2019d been dreaming of them for weeks: heads down, green sheen on top, slow paddling little machines that carried more mystery than their waddle deserved. A beak turning. A bead of a black eye finding her from the reeds.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d she told the empty room, and then found her phone by sweeping the charger cord along the floor like a fisherman. The screen lit with the same picture over and over, re-shared, meme-ified, captioned a dozen ways, none of them generous. A paparazzi caught her at Swan Grove, the park in Studio City with the pond and the willow trees, except that day the swans had been outnumbered. Mallards had arrived in a green-headed gang. Lark\u2019s posture in the photo said everything: her shoulders up like rabbit ears, hand up to block, eyes wide, mouth in a small, round O, the way people make a small O before they scream in a movie. The nearest duck looked profoundly unconcerned. The headline said DUCK, LARK! Fear is a four-letter word if you write it as DUCK.\n\nHer agent texted four times before the coffee pot wheezed. Denise wrote the kind of everything-okay message that means nothing is okay without press management. The PR team suggested posting a video hugging a duck. The director of the film she was due to promote sent a shrug emoji that Lark read as: this again.\n\nShe didn\u2019t reply. She sat in the slick rental kitchen in the hills and drank coffee that tasted expensive and metallic. Her phone trembled alive on the counter, buzz buzz, like a fly against a screen. She turned it over. She covered it with a napkin. The quack came back anyway, like a thought you can\u2019t disinvite. She closed her eyes and felt a wild rush under her ribs, a flutter. People always said butterflies for nerves. Those felt too pretty. What lived inside Lark were frantic sparrows throwing themselves against glass.\n\nThe thing with the ducks wasn\u2019t new. It wasn\u2019t even unusual. If you were Lark Corwin and you had been nine in Westfield when your father married a woman with a stepdaughter and a backyard that touched the little municipal pond\u2014if you had been that person you too might remember the way the ducks would climb the slope in a polite row like they were walking into your kitchen to ask for tea. You\u2019d remember their tiny wet footprints. You\u2019d remember one of them turning its head toward you, the slow, low-feeling look that felt like a calculation. You\u2019d remember not trusting their quiet, and your new stepmother laughing and saying, Come on now, they\u2019re hungry, Lark, they\u2019re not assassins.\n\nShe became a movie star for a messy stew of reasons (she had the kind of face cameras like to drink, she had patience for long days, she was better than you would think at making chaos look intentional, and also luck, luck with a capital L that felt like someone else\u2019s game). The world was wide with lenses. So some things could hide. You could be terrified of the sight of a webbed foot and no one would know for eight years.\n\nDenise called. Lark picked up because it felt like not picking up was choosing a new kind of hell, the one where someone in a suit starts using the phrase \"noncompliance\" in a sentence.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a headline,\u201d Denise said, without hello, voice already running on the heel of a high shoe. \u201cIs it real? Tell me it\u2019s a bit. Tell me we can turn this. Tell me we can get a children\u2019s book out of it in eighteen months.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d Lark said. She tried to laugh then, as if by laughing she could frame it as a brand. You know me! Quirky fear of ducks! Movie star\u2014afraid of a backyard animal! Did you know? \u201cI don\u2019t think I can work with them anymore. Or near them. Or like, within the radius of a duck's thought.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin the radius of a duck\u2019s thought,\u201d Denise repeated, and sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re on Fallon Thursday. They\u2019re going to try to bring one out. You need to be able to handle plastic. If it\u2019s rubber we can talk. We can lean into rubber.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubber is worse. The eyes on those\u2026 they\u2019re fixed and they know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay this is spiraling. Listen. Post that shot of you feeding ducks when you were what, ten? People need continuity. Vintage content. Nostalgia gives them context. Then we do a few light interviews, you tell a funny story, we do a donation to some bird sanctuary, we make you an animal lover again who\u2019s just having a human moment, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never fed ducks. That picture is of June,\u201d Lark said, and swallowed the name because it felt like something unwrapped in a room full of strangers. June with her knees dirty, tossing crumbles from her palm, laughing in that way she always laughed when something lived in two states at once\u2014beautiful and ridiculous.\n\nThe call ended on a plan that sounded like a plan: a social post, a retort, a dress chosen that couldn\u2019t possibly read duck. Lark put the phone down. She wanted something that did not exist. She wanted, in a sudden old way, her hometown kitchen and the radio low, the tiled table, the sunlight off the pond, even the smell from the pond, which was part fish, part damp, part algae, part laundry dryer vent that wafted in from the house next door.\n\nHer driver was waiting in an app. Had been for twenty minutes. The little car on the map made jittery hesitant movements, like perhaps the driver had a duck of his own.\n\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d he said when she finally slid into the cool back seat, her baseball cap down and her sunglasses up. He clocked her in the way people do when they think they might know you later.\n\n\u201cWestfield,\u201d she said.\n\nHe glanced back. \u201cYou mean Westwood?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cWestfield. The one with the mall and the pond and the ice cream place that sells the weird lavender flavor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not around here,\u201d he said, carefully.\n\n\u201cNo. I know.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cLAX. Then... I\u2019ll get the rest.\u201d\n\nOn the plane, she read the same page of a magazine four times because the article on sustainable engineering kept breaking itself into the face of a mallard. She wrote a text to June, then deleted it. She wrote a text to her father that said \u201cComing home,\u201d and didn\u2019t send that either. The drink cart clanged past. The woman next to her tried to start a smiling war. Lark closed her eyes and made a movie in her head. In the movie she went to Westfield and nothing mattered as much as everyone said it did. In the movie, the world would forgive a person their biological brambles. In the movie, the pond would be frozen again, and she and June would skate on dull blades that cut soft white lines the shape of words you didn\u2019t want to say out loud yet.\n\nThe airport smelled like cinnamon and floor wax and nobody recognized her when she pulled up her hoodie. Westfield did not have a paparazzi economy. The taxi driver did not ask for a selfie. He asked if she had cash because the card reader did not like rain. It was not raining. Everyone in town talked like it might, though\u2014they looked up and mentioned the possibility as you handed them a five, as they bagged your bananas, as they told you it had been a wild week for the Hawks.\n\nHer father\u2019s house had a new paint color no one had prepped her for. It had been a quiet yellow in her mind; it was now some stoic gray that made the house look like it had been reading books about boundaries. The front garden had knows what it was doing. Ranks of lavender. A lemon tree. A small wind sculpture made of copper hands.\n\nWhen she walked in, she heard the kitchen radio sweetly tin and June explaining how to solder to someone over speaker.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late because you don\u2019t respect my time,\u201d June said. \u201cNo,\u201d she added, \u201cthat\u2019s me being dramatic. You\u2019re late because time is a circle and you live in a line. Left hand steady, okay? If you\u2019re going to blow up, don\u2019t do it in my face.\u201d\n\nJune didn\u2019t look surprised to see Lark in the doorway because June never looked surprised the way regular people did. She breathed in slowly, like painters step back to catch the whole of what they\u2019ve been working on. She was a little taller than Lark remembered, or maybe she just stood more decided. Her hair was cut blunt and practical, her hands were steady and shop-stained, and her shirt read ALL MY HEROES DIED AT MACH 26.\n\n\u201cCall me back,\u201d June said to her phone, and hung up. \u201cHey.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Lark said. And because homes have scripts, she added, \u201cYou cut your hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ran away from ducks,\u201d June said. Not unkind.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t run.\u201d Lark put her bag down. \u201cI\u2026 okay, I ran. You saw.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone saw,\u201d June said. \u201cWestfield might not have paparazzi, but we have the internet.\u201d\n\nThey hugged. The hug was familiar, even if everything else had gotten new edges. When they were younger, their hugs had been a message: we will do our best to invoke sisterhood even if our families were reorganized at the council of adults and then told to buzz like bees. Now it was its own thing. A small port city where weather didn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cYour room is as you left it,\u201d June said. \u201cWith the addition of an oscillating fan that sounds like an old man concerned about politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy old room.\u201d Lark smiled at the phrase, worn smooth from use. No one\u2019s room is as they left it. They had child selves that had moved out. Two steps into the hallway she understood that rule\u2014on the wall there was a framed magazine cover of Lark from two years ago, and opposite it there were three pencil sketches of cylinders with fins, and on the floor at the far end a basket of lemons, each with a little face drawn on in sharpie.\n\n\u201cYou drawing on fruit?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were asking for it,\u201d June said.\n\nTheir father came home with soil on his hands, the good kind. He made a Lark noise, which was a sound that had her name in it without needing the letters, a small delighted exhale, and then he stood there in his boots and waited like he had learned not to rush a person who had just crossed a distance. His second wife, Tamara, was in Santa Fe for a pottery intensive and sent a photo of a vase that looked like it had been built to be angry.\n\nThey ate something simple that did not have duck in it. People kept trying to be funny about that, Lark found, as if cruelty becomes less when you drape it in roasted orange slices. Her father asked her about the work, careful and kind. June asked nothing. June talked about materials. The kitchen filled with parts: the word for a curved section of a nose cone, the way to hold a file, the bland perfection of stainless steel when you want heat to have a place to go that is not critical.\n\n\u201cJust say it,\u201d Lark said finally, hand flat to the table. \u201cI\u2019m ridiculous. Say it. Everyone else is. The director said \u2018we can always CGI them out, sweetheart\u2019 to my face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re not ridiculous,\u201d June said. \u201cBut tell me what you think is my opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I should control it. That I should get over it. Exposure therapy. Like a video montage\u2014me feeding a duck, me hugging a duck, me acting with a duck named Winston.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not putting animals in a montage,\u201d June said. \u201cBut if we\u2019re doing honesty, it is inconvenient if your job wants ponds and your nervous system wants deserts.\u201d\n\nTheir father stirred his tea and said, \u201cDeserts have birds too. Sandpipers. Tall cranes. Buzzards. Very cinematic.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Lark said, and laughed despite herself, which hurt her ribs for some reason. \u201cIt is inconvenient. But calling it ridiculous doesn\u2019t make it less. It makes me feel like I\u2019m failing an exam that I didn\u2019t choose to take. Did you know ducks can sleep with one eye open? That they actually do that? How am I supposed to be out there doing soft smile eyes into a lens when some bird is half asleep and half seeing me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know other animals do stranger things,\u201d June said. \u201cSharks sleep while moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not comforting, June.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be,\u201d June said. \u201cThey keep going. That\u2019s the whole point of life. You keep going and if you have a fear you give it a seatbelt.\u201d\n\nShe said it like she believed it. Lark wanted to believe it too. Her father reached for the honey and missed, and nobody corrected him because he found it the second time anyway.\n\nThat night, in her old room that was now a guest room with her face on the wall, Lark lay under a quilt and let the sound of the pond come through the window screen. No matter how long she had been gone, Westfield sounded like itself. Freight trains that took forever. A teenager practicing drums across the street. The occasional car that made too much of a noise because some boy\u2019s father had left the world and the boy needed the engine to be a person for a while. She turned her phone face down. It did not know how to lie there quietly. It had to twitch, to remind. Then, because her brain was a grinning jerk, she started to count ducks instead of sheep.\n\nShe stood at the pond at dawn because the body remembers paths even when the mind doesn\u2019t approve of the destination. She\u2019d slipped out while everyone slept\u2014June on the couch covered in a schematic, her father still on the left side of the bed because even remarriages keep the map of the old house. The fog was like a careful old woman smoothing a scarf. A man with a dog nodded. The dog was small and named Pancake. Lark knew because the man said it to the dog twice, partly to tell her what the dog was called. It felt like the kind of morning when everything tries to be good.\n\nThen a duck saw her.\n\nOr she saw it. It had the spherical, indifferent head that a duck wore to breakfast. It turned. The low cold in her went on. She backed up. Her hands were up as if in a robbery. The duck was not interested. The ducks never were, that was the stupid part. The fear had nothing to do with their intention. The fear was a current under glass you only saw when it rippled the cup.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d asked a voice, which turned out to be attached to a boy who looked fourteen and had a skateboard and the world\u2019s most merciful eyebrows. Kids, she thought. The exact mercies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she lied. Then she tried again. \u201cNo. I\u2019m a little\u2026 weird about these birds.\u201d\n\n\u201cDucks?\u201d He said the word without malice. He set one wheel of the skateboard down, then took it back up. \u201cMy aunt\u2019s afraid of bananas,\u201d he offered. \u201cIt\u2019s like the curve. Makes her feel judged.\u201d\n\nLark laughed again and this time it didn\u2019t hurt. \u201cI might be afraid of their curve too.\u201d\n\nShe sipped air until the ducks gave her a gift and drifted away. She walked home past a flyer for a missing cat named Mouse. She tried to feel the ground. She tried to feel her feet.\n\nJune was in the garage when she got back, which wasn\u2019t a garage anymore but a laboratory made of porch fans, lists in chalk, and the far sweet smell of burnt metal. The door groaned. June didn\u2019t look up right away. Lark just watched. The two silver sections of something stood in the corner, upright, like a pair of bored Romans waiting to be sent to a war. Not two. One in halves.\n\n\u201cThis is the part where you tell me I\u2019m insane,\u201d June said, finally raising her head. \u201cBefore you do, remember you used to put on your mother\u2019s wedding dress and go to Dairy Queen for a dipped cone on the day summer began. We all have our calendars.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you building,\u201d Lark said, like she didn\u2019t know, because saying it out loud changes the gravity of a room.\n\n\u201cA rocket,\u201d June said. \u201cOr some language of a rocket, for now.\u201d\n\nLark laughed then and moved closer so she could take in the welds, the inset rings, the stiffeners, the way June\u2019s hands had learned softness around hardness. There were notes on the wall. Names like Hargrave. Words like bipropellant and delta-v and orbit, all spelled correctly in June\u2019s neat hand, as if that were what would change the fate of a body. Spelling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d June said. \u201cI mean, it is exactly what you think, but also even more ridiculous. I am not starting a billion-dollar company. I am building a rocket that could go up with a person like you could ride a stubborn horse\u2014only once, only maybe to the edge of what we call the place where we are. It\u2019s an idea. It\u2019s my idea. I won a municipal innovation grant. The town thinks it\u2019s a sculpture. The town is half-right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won a what?\u201d Lark said, feeling the small grin that made people think she had a joke even when she didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWestfield Municipal Arts and Innovation Fund. Sponsored by the mall and a person who made a lot of money selling water in cans. They think they\u2019re paying for a pretty thing to put outside the library with the plaque that says 'we dreamed,' and they are. But also, if you engineer a sculpture correctly, you can use it to leave.\u201d\n\nShe said all this casual, like a grocery list. Lark touched the cool skin of the cylinder with her fingertips and felt a ripple of fear because if the thing meant what June meant it to mean, the object in front of her was the exact opposite of a duck. A duck said: come close, because I\u2019m in the world and so are you. A rocket said: you can go. To the other side of night. To the black that is not empty.\n\n\u201cThis is illegal,\u201d she said, eventually.\n\n\u201cNot at this scale,\u201d June said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s illegal where changes because we push against our own rules long enough that they accommodate us. And I\u2019m not going to the moon. Not yet. I\u2019m going to the sky in a way that matters to me. I need test pilots who are not afraid to breathe hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Lark said. \u201cI nearly fainted at the mall fountain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not looking at you like a pilot,\u201d June said. \u201cI am looking at you like a person who knows what it means to be looked at. There will be cameras. There will be the world. There will be men who want to collect failures the way other men collect foreign coins. They will count. They will say names wrong on purpose. I need someone who knows how to tilt their head and make it not matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to build a rocket and what you need from me is\u2026 posture?\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong other things,\u201d June said. \u201cYou have a platform that is a half-built stage. I have a thing that everyone will want to stand on and shout. We could trade the parts we have.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want my mouth to be a ladder,\u201d Lark said, and June grinned, guilty.\n\n\u201cAnd also,\u201d June added, softer. \u201cI want something else. I want to give you a piece of sky that is never going to have a duck in it.\u201d\n\nLark looked at her sister then and felt time fold weirdly. When they were teenagers, they had lay on the trampoline in Tamara\u2019s yard and watched planes cross, tiny white lines drawn by cold. June would say their flight numbers like a magic trick\u2014she\u2019d look them up and whisper secret numbers like spells. She wanted to be a pilot then, then an engineer, then a person who found a way to be both because why stop. Lark wanted to be in front of a camera because inside the lens things behaved. Now they stood here again, older and more ourselves.\n\n\u201cYou get it,\u201d June said. \u201cYou get it the way the pond gets the moon. Takes it like a fact and still makes it beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe rest of that week was small and big at once. Denise called daily with instructions that felt like they were written in a font designed to erase you. Post the thing. Laugh at yourself. Say \u201cI just have a tiny quirk\u201d in the baby voice people use to sell cute. Lark posted nothing. She went to the grocery store and a woman from the bank put her hand on Lark\u2019s wrist and said, \u201cI feel exactly how you feel but about escalators, and I still go on them because there\u2019s no staircase at Target,\u201d which warmed Lark in a place that fame had not reached. A high school friend texted \u201cAre you in town or am I seeing your ghost at Beans & Books,\u201d which was the name of the cafe that had survived the war against big coffee somehow, weak but undefeated. Her father planted beans like the world would continue. June built.\n\n\u201cNot everyone is going to like this,\u201d June warned, when she finally had a prototype that made noises not unlike a large cat in yoga. They stood in the cul-de-sac. The neighbors had collected themselves in chairs like an audience at a small town parade. Mr. Roscoe, who ran the radio repair store, wore a hat that said 20 METERS MAKES LIFE. Children wore headphones and skepticism. The newspaper sent a kid with a notebook who described himself as a student of journalism and then asked if he could film it vertical for Instagram because that\u2019s where the paper\u2019s engagement lives, ma\u2019am.\n\n\u201cI never asked everyone to like me,\u201d June said. \u201cI asked them to brace.\u201d\n\nThe first test did what first tests do. It shivered and stuttered. It huffed. It lifted an inch and then politely sat back down like someone changed their mind. Mr. Roscoe clapped anyway. A man named Ron (there\u2019s always a Ron) rolled his eyes and said, \u201cIt\u2019ll never work with an off-the-shelf compressor. You need injection. That, or a miracle.\u201d Someone else snorted. A child said, \u201cCan it go to Mars,\u201d as if Mars were a mall.\n\n\u201cPeople think miracles are a kind of lightning bolt,\u201d June said later, when they sat on the garage step with two sweating bottles of soda that tasted like lemon and other lemon. \u201cReally a miracle is just a lot of tiny mechanical parts saying yes at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to make it say yes,\u201d Lark said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to listen for where to say I\u2019m sorry,\u201d June said. \u201cDon\u2019t say that to the paper. They like you confident or nothing.\u201d\n\nLark walked to the pond again even though it was a bad idea. She liked bad ideas that involved footwear and short distances and no press. Beside the bench there was a man feeding ducks even though the posted sign said do not feed them, bread is bad for birds. He made a show of ignoring the sign, which is a familiar performance. He had that kind of shirt older men wear like a story, with a small embroidered ship that suggested he\u2019d been a captain of something maybe or just in the navy or just liked a sale. He glanced at her twice. He had seen her in a movie once and not remembered her name. He had seen her in a picture yesterday and learned it for the pleasure of saying it wrong.\n\n\u201cLark,\u201d he said, which was the first time anyone said it like a scold. \u201cYou know they\u2019re just ducks. The world is burning and you\u2019re afraid of ducks.\u201d\n\nShe stood there with her hands in her pockets and felt like someone had opened a window before the house was warm enough to want it.\n\nHe continued, because men like to complete the sound of their own lessons. \u201cPeople got real problems. Real things to be afraid of. I got a brother who can\u2019t sleep unless he sees his meds on the dresser. That\u2019s fear. Yours is\u2026 c\u2019mon. It\u2019s like saying you\u2019re allergic to Tuesdays.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and because she had learned some things from actors who are also fighters, she separated her body into two layers: the place where the words would go and the place where her shame would live. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m not being heroic enough for your enjoyment. I\u2019m not being brave in the way that photographs well. I didn\u2019t ask to be. Why do we all keep asking everyone to impress us. Maybe some of us are just people with bones and batteries and a weird kind of brain.\u201d\n\nHe muttered something that might have been a dismissal or a swear. A duck came closer and she took a step back. Someone took a photo. The world made a click. She held her ground anyway. The town would read about it and be split down the middle because towns love to be split and then slowly healed by an event involving pie.\n\n\u201cCome by the garage,\u201d June said, when Lark told her about it later, small and brittle. \u201cI need your arm strength to hold this steady while I recalibrate the thrusters. No\u2014you have tiny wrists. I need your attention instead. Attention is the stronger muscle. Hold this thing in your head and don\u2019t look away.\u201d\n\nIt was good work, the kind that made your brain quiet enough inside. June explained each thing out loud to herself and the room like she was both teacher and student. The rings aligned. The tubes hissed. The valves listened. They were making a thing that wanted to leave. That was the part that kept sticking inside Lark\u2019s chest: the audacity of not just wanting to leave, but building the door. She had left Westfield earlier than people thought she would. That was nothing. She\u2019d used airplanes and cars and trains and a talent people liked to believe came from nowhere. This was not that. This was making movement from a held breath.\n\nThat night, Lark posted something. Not a duck video. Not a joke. A picture of June\u2019s hands, greased and deliberate, holding the edges of the cylinder like you hold a person at the threshold of something, and under it she wrote: The future isn\u2019t over us. We\u2019re still voting on it.\n\nDenise called so quickly it felt like she had been lying in wait.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy sister,\u201d Lark said. \u201cIn case you forgot. And me, choosing a different room to stand in.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Denise said. \u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of gorgeous. Not the hands, the copy. You could sell wellness with that. If you must soft-launch your departure from brand duck-chatter, at least let me be the one to monetize it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I was the brand.\u201d Lark was tired past her bones.\n\n\u201cYou are the brand if the brand can be rescued from birds by a blonde with a toolbox. Just\u2014be careful. The world loves to cheer a woman for leaving and then trip her at the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not blonde,\u201d Lark said. \u201cAnd she carries a welding mask like it\u2019s a crown.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven better,\u201d Denise said, her voice shifting. \u201cSend me three more images. I\u2019ll build a carousel. People love carousels.\u201d\n\nNot everyone did. There were comments that said, Shut up and kiss a duck for charity. There were ones that said, Women have been building rockets since you were in pigtails and now you want clout off it, boo. The ones that hurt more were smaller and close. A woman from her high school wrote, Remember when you laughed at my fear of Ferris wheels, karma is a wheel, babe.\n\n\u201cI did not laugh,\u201d Lark said to the air. \u201cI smiled because your mother had just bought you cotton candy and your face was blue.\u201d\n\nShe stepped back out into the dusk because in Westfield dusk had a texture you could use to heal yourself. June was bent over the rocket again. Her hair stuck to her neck. A small fly considered the back of her hand and then amended its plan when she flicked it away without looking. Lark had a sensation then, a tiny, ambitious one, of a kind she would probably have to fight. It felt like wanting to be a part of whatever June's life was turning into in a way that would matter historically. It felt like the beginning of an answer to a question she had not dared put into her mouth. It felt like movement toward something that wouldn\u2019t fit neatly into a segment on late night television.\n\n\u201cYou test again tomorrow,\u201d Lark said.\n\n\u201cIf the goose-neck fittings arrive,\u201d June said. \u201cIf Ron doesn\u2019t try to sabotage me with his opinions. If the town allows it. Pax Roscoe is sending the mayor\u2019s office a tray of donuts. He swears donuts do more than petitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou asked for support,\u201d Lark said, remembering the way towns attach themselves to something like ivy climbing a wall and then tear it down later when it gets too tall.\n\n\u201cI asked for a clean launch window,\u201d June said. \u201cSupport is\u2026 noise.\u201d\n\nThe next morning the mayor came by with a camera crew from the station that only ran news when there was an incident at the high school or when the cherry blossoms hit all at once and everyone lost their minds. She wore a blue jacket like a sky promise and said words over a microphone about innovation and community and liftoff. A man from the fire department evaluated the extinguishers and issued a mild frown. Mr. Roscoe wore his hat again like a permission slip. Children sang a song no one had written for this occasion, a song about up and away they\u2019d learned from a cartoon. Lark stood beside June and put her body\u2019s quiet to the service of the moment. If she let the moment say, This is a circus, then that would be the truth. If she let it say, This is a debut, then that would be true as well. The truth was a kite; it doesn\u2019t fly unless you move.\n\nThe prototype rose three inches. It sank. Boom? No. A tap on the ground that made a sound like a large hand clapping politely in a hall. A piece of the crowd cheered anyway. Ron tried to be seen not cheering. The kid from the paper took his vertical video. The mayor kissed June on the cheek and whispered something Lark did not hear, and June\u2019s face did something Lark had not seen on it since she was sixteen and her teacher had put a perfect score on a physics exam and then written \"but where will you put this, June?\" in the margin like an accusation.\n\n\u201cI will put it,\u201d June had told that paper with her pencil, a little angrily, \u201cin the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want pie,\u201d their father asked later because he had cooked two pies in a row for comfort and no matter the occasion pie was a rational response. Lark ate pie. June ate pie like fueling. Denise texted to say the video had been seen by 1.3 million strangers. Lark read the comments even though she knew not to. She cried anyway, not at the cruelty but at the strange kindnesses that come like postcards from people you will never meet who understand the shape of your problem like it\u2019s a thing they can hold.\n\nThere were other moments in that first week that made a chapter: a small girl in a sparkly yellow dress who asked Lark to sign the inside of her book because her mother said you sign inside the cover if the person means it; a man who drove past and shouted \u201cQuack-quack\u201d as if this was the height of wit; the priest from the church with the red doors saying, \u201cWe are not hosting the launch, but we would love to bless the driveway if you think it would help,\u201d and finding a way to make that sweet and not ridiculous. June hammered. Lark answered questions that no one had asked her in the same way twice before, she crafted yeses that weren't lies, not all the time.\n\nLate the night before the second test, June sat with her feet in the plastic baby pool because she said the earth was too far away for her ankles. Lark leaned on the garage doorway. It was like that the best conversations found them\u2014near tools, tired, unguarded.\n\n\u201cThis might fail,\u201d June said, into the pool\u2019s small echo. \u201cNot just this test, the whole thing. It might be an exercise that makes everyone think about how they end up back where they started. And I\u2019ve spent everything. Not money. I mean the juice. The part of me that thinks new things. What if it goes quiet after this and I am just\u2026,\u201d she made a small motion with her hands, letting them fall, \u201csomeone who talked loudly about the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not be just someone who talked,\u201d Lark said. \u201cYou will be someone who tried. I hate that word too. It sounds like a mother telling you \u2018eat the broccoli at least try it at least try.\u2019 But I mean it like\u2026 like the part you keep for yourself. You will know. And I will know. Everyone else can go line up at Ron\u2019s for their requested opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I wish you were meaner,\u201d June said.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Lark said. \u201cJust not to you.\u201d\n\nThe second test cut something open in the air and poured light through. For a breath it looked like a coin flicked up and maybe, maybe, maybe a miracle\u2014that chorus of tiny parts\u2014would sing. Three feet, four, six. People shouted like they were at a high school game they had been waiting to win for twenty years. June\u2019s face opened. Lark\u2019s body leaned toward the noise. The thing hung and then came back, slow enough to be called descent instead of drop. When it touched the ground the crowd exhaled as a creature and some of them realized they had been holding their phones and they looked down to check if their recording had happened like it was supposed to. The firefighter who had frowned earlier smiled. The mayor did a little dance. Ron started to walk away and then pretended he had always meant to walk.\n\nJune turned to Lark and raised both hands without words. Lark slapped them with hers and felt silly and happy, like a cheap version of God had given her permission to be outside of herself.\n\n\u201cIt works,\u201d June said. \u201cIt might work.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything works until it doesn\u2019t and then it works again,\u201d Lark said, choosing to be both cheerleader and philosopher because the moment allowed it. \u201cAlso, you will soon have to file so much paperwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater. Now is for taking two pictures and making a face,\u201d June said. She made a face. Lark took the pictures.\n\nThey celebrated by eating noodles from the place that had always been there and pretended to be new for the kids who came home from college. Lark sat on the curb with her takeout box and watched the sky become that weird Westfield purple. She could feel the planet turning, which was a trick she had learned from her grandmother: stand still, focus on the tall tree like it is fixed, and then let your mind decide the tree is holding still and you are, too, relative to it, so everything else becomes the thing that moves. When she did this, her fear felt like another sphere she might step off. Persuadable. Not cured. Never call it cured. That word steals maintenance.\n\nA teen girl came up and said, \u201cI liked you in 'Frontier Heart' and I liked that you screamed like a normal person when the ghosts came. Now they\u2019re being mean because you screamed in a park. I think that\u2019s stupid,\u201d and Lark said thank you with a genuine thank and not a celebrity hearing her own line read. The town did what towns do: it made a place for her until it forgot to and then it remembered again.\n\nDenise called one more time with that tone that meant a war council. \u201cThey offered you the barn-find romance,\u201d she said, naming a script like you name a weather pattern. \u201cThe one where you find a car and a man and your true self all in a field with good lighting. There\u2019s one scene with ducks in it but they said you can be doubled.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing a duck double,\u201d Lark said. \u201cAlso I\u2019m not doing a barn find romance. I am not a woman who discovers that she loves manual labor only when a man touches her hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Denise said, after a beat. \u201cYou\u2019re also being offered an independent film by that director who always casts sharp women. Two scenes in a kitchen. A monologue that might break people. No animals except metaphorical. They pay you nothing and they will love you forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to help June,\u201d Lark said. \u201cI want to\u2026 I think I want this to be what matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do both,\u201d Denise said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do everything. Pick two. Not three. Two. The third will eat you.\u201d\n\nIn bed that night, Lark tried to pick. She could feel the two on each shoulder like the old cartoons. Film and June. Fame and family. Or\u2014cleaner names. Story and sky. Inside her, the ducks had found a different pond. They were quieter. They were still there. She had not defeated them like a hero in a cheap plot. She had done something else, which was to reorient her fear toward a different north. The new coin spinning in the dark was a thing June had set in motion and Lark could, if she wanted, keep that coin in the air with the one thing she had that wasn't gone: attention that bent other people's eyes.\n\nIn the morning, she wrote the director with the sharp women and said yes. She wrote Denise and said no to the barn car and the man and the field. She wrote the mayor and asked if they could find a way to keep the library open late on launch nights. She wrote to nobody the story about the man at the pond and his thin mercy and then she changed the endings until the ducks in it did nothing but drift like thoughts.\n\nAnd she went to the garage and held the flashlight while June crawled under the belly of a thing that wanted to be dangerous so it could be useful, or useful so it could be beautiful\u2014it was hard to untangle the words. She stood there with her arms up and the light steady and she thought, not about the movie she had turned down or the one she would do, but about a bus she had ridden once all the way to the end of the line when she had been thirteen and furious. She thought how good it had felt, the wheels making a long loud vowel out of the road. She pictured the bus pulled up at a curb she did not yet know, the driver looking in the mirror to see if anyone else would get off, the sign in front flashing OUT OF SERVICE and meaning it.\n\nShe moved the light a little to the left. \u201cHere?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cRight there,\u201d June said. \u201cHold it right there. Don\u2019t blink.\u201d",

They were tidy, stacked, taped with care as if the tape itself could be the balm. On the porch one morning there was a waterlogged box that had once been full of grapefruit, a bright purple bubble mailer, a brown envelope with a child\u2019s handwriting that marched and listed like a troop. Inside: rubber ducks with sunglasses, rubber ducks with tiny capes, a ceramic duck with eyelashes like a car from the fifties, a hand-knit duck that had suffered a little in the mail and leaned forward like it needed a cane. There were notes, too, written on index cards and napkins and the backs of old school fliers. The notes had the cadence of confession. I\u2019m scared of geese, wrote someone from Colorado. I can't stand balloons, wrote someone else, too much waiting for a pop. I faint when I see blood, said a nurse who kept a peppermint in her cheek and pinched her own thigh at the sight of a paper cut. June lined them up on the kitchen island until the island looked like a tiny, bright city founded on the premise that everything floatable should be honored for trying.\n\nDenise texted Lark a picture of a billboard on Sunset that someone had altered: the ad originally for a perfume now had a duck sticker over the bottle and a speech bubble that said, quack if you love chaos. \u201cWe can sell this,\u201d Denise said over the phone, not pretending at hello. \u201cNot the duck thing\u2014God deliver me from the duck thing\u2014but the pivot. The sister with the rocket. The two of you against inertia. I\u2019m getting DMs from three production companies who do docuseries with the word \u2018intimate\u2019 in the pitch deck. Also, the Fallon team will book you if you bring your sister, and they promise no animals, fake or otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t doing Fallon,\u201d Lark said, walking a box in from the porch with one hip while holding the door with a knee because her hands were full of plush zoology.\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t,\u201d Denise said briskly. \u201cBut America loves to revise. The meme fatigue cycle is approximately seventeen hours. Seize hour eighteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s building a rocket,\u201d Lark said. \u201cShe\u2019s not building a narrative arc for a ten-minute segment with a cutaway to Roots drummer applause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are not mutually exclusive,\u201d Denise said, and Lark could hear her typing, a soft wingbeat. \u201cListen. Don\u2019t say yes yet. Don\u2019t say no. Say you are considering. Meanwhile I want three clean images of June that look like the future without looking like the future is sponsored.\u201d\n\nThrough the open doorway she saw June shirtless to her sports bra, her hair braided now because even practicality likes to feel contained, lifting the top shell of the cylinder with a friend\u2019s help. The friend was a woman from June\u2019s old robotics club in high school named Sita, and she had driven in from three towns over with a socket set most people would be happy to be buried with. Sita had a baby sleeping in a sling against her chest that breathed in small important ways as she torqued. The baby\u2019s fingers flexed and opened around air, as if claiming it. Lark took the requested images. She framed the shot so the stroller wasn\u2019t visible, not to erase anything but because she could feel it: the way a stranger would look at the picture and say, Woman works while mothering, and call it brave and then use the word as a handclap they could be done with. June\u2019s face in the pictures made a third option. The muscle in her jaw spoke more truth than a caption could.\n\nThere was a flyer on the cafe corkboard that morning between a missing ferret and a notice for a book club that only read romance novels where someone was a ghost. \u201cTown Listening Session,\u201d the flyer said in the mayor\u2019s assistant\u2019s earnest font, all round vowels and optimism. \u201cProposed Demonstration: Municipal Arts and Innovation Project (Scalable Kinetics Installation), Public Safety Protocol, Q&A.\u201d Someone had drawn in pen beside the official words: rockets?? and then, below that, a different hand had written yes rockets, we are the town, and then a third hand had written, if it explodes do we get to keep the pieces. Lark ordered her coffee and a lemon cookie that pretended to be a breakfast by having oats and sat in the corner where she\u2019d once kissed a boy who had been interesting because he\u2019d known all the names of the constellations and had not yet known the names of his own limits. The cafe radio did the thing small town radios do where they fold themselves around your years\u2014a song from ten summers ago, a voice that had aged with you, a commercial for a basement waterproofing company that added ducks to the sound effects and then apologized with humor that never quite made the apology stick.\n\nPax Roscoe came in with a tray of donuts and a grin that was half salesman, half saint. He wore the hat again (20 METERS MAKES LIFE) and he shook Lark\u2019s hand like he was a person who knew his strength. \u201cI put a word in with the mayor about the fire line,\u201d he said, as if saying the phrase \u201cfire line\u201d were a communion. \u201cAnd a little something to the FAA woman so she knows we\u2019re not trying to start a man-with-ideas nightmare.\u201d\n\n\u201cFAA woman?\u201d Lark said. She felt a small ripple across her stomach, a familiar one that meant the thing was getting bigger and real, and that she would have to be brave in the right direction.\n\n\u201cInspector. Specialist. Person who knows which forms grow up to be other forms,\u201d Pax said. \u201cName\u2019s Irene. She\u2019s been at Mojave and places where people look at air like land that hasn\u2019t been claimed. You two will like each other. She uses the word \u2018consequence\u2019 like it\u2019s a wheel you turn, not a punishment.\u201d\n\nJune pretended not to listen but you could tell she was listening because she cleaned the same spot on the stainless twice. \u201cGood,\u201d she said eventually. \u201cIrene is a name I trust.\u201d She wrote it on the chalk wall under \u201cthings that can keep me from lighting the match\u201d and then drew a small heart beside it like a dare to fate.\n\nThe town listening session was held in the library meeting room where they\u2019d hosted many a bake sale and a poetry night and once, disastrously, a youth improv troupe whose only tool was shouting. Someone had painted the wall with a mural years before: a splash of pond water (of course the pond), a blue sky with birds (they were too round to be ducks, a gift), and children holding hands in a way that real children don\u2019t, with earnest elbows. Folding chairs made their metal music. The mayor had learned how to speak into a microphone without flinching. She wore her hair up like a librarian who had once driven straight through the night because the road permitted it. \u201cWe are here to listen,\u201d she said, and the way she said we contained all the ways a town is still a mess and a miracle at once.\n\nRon had a clipboard. Even his clipboard had a posture. He had collected signatures that said nothing on them except a name and the desire to be on the record against something. He stood up first like men in rooms have learned to do, and he waved the clipboard as if he could make the sound of his paper louder than the sound of an engine. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live here. It\u2019s noise and danger. There are birds. There are children. There are cars with paint that will get dust on them. There\u2019s precedent. There\u2019s liability. There\u2019s my dog that barks at unusual frequencies. There\u2019s my wife who has migraines.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring your wife to me,\u201d said the woman behind Lark who turned out to be the town\u2019s acupuncturist, soft-voiced, fierce. \u201cWe will fix her head and your dog can come too. And as for danger\u2014aren\u2019t you at least a little bored of not doing anything we can tell our grandkids about?\u201d\n\nA murmur traveled the room like the thought of weather. June stood when it was her turn and did not do the cuteness of apologizing. She was precise. \u201cThe fuel is not what you are imagining,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no mass driver. There is no bomb. The small violent part of this will be contained here,\u201d she pointed to the diagram, \u201cand the part that concerns your hearing will be managed here and here and with cones, and with distance. The worst case scenario is not even the worst case scenario you have already imagined. It is that this does a small hop and lands wrong and we have a dent. We have protocols. I will have Irene. I want to put a pretty thing in front of the library. When it has done what I want it to do, it will still be a pretty thing. Your taxes will not pay anything additional to what they are already paying for kids to draw and people to have a place to come when they can\u2019t pay for internet.\u201d\n\nHer hands made shapes in the air while she talked, and the shapes were geometry that had learned to dance without embarrassment. Lark watched the room watch her and felt that small old jealousy that was not about attention but about certainty. When June finished, Lark couldn\u2019t hold back. She stood up without knowing what her second sentence would be and decided to pretend this was a late-night segment of the good kind, the kind without a couch, the kind where you speak like a person rather than a person playing a person. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me to tell you what fear feels like,\u201d she said, and she saw heads tilt because anyone who had a knee or a grandparent had a fear. \u201cYou also don\u2019t need me to tell you that you live here and it\u2019s your town and you love it in the exact way that makes you put your name on a piece of paper that says no when something looks like it might rearrange your peace. But I want to borrow your attention for what a yes looks like. It looks like your kids seeing a thing that doesn\u2019t apologize for wanting up. It looks like a day that isn\u2019t the same as other days, and you being a part of that instead of watching it later on someone else\u2019s screen and then pretending you\u2019d been there. And, selfishly, it looks like a person like me, who you are generously tolerating at your grocery store, standing out there and not being afraid. Not because my fear is over, but because I chose to stand in another direction while it kept doing its job. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s my ask. I brought cookies.\u201d\n\nShe had indeed brought cookies because a woman on the internet once told her that if you are going to ask a group for a favor, you should bring small sugary discs to confuse their lizard brains into saying yes with glucose. She held up the tin and felt ridiculous and also absolutely correct. The librarian beamed the librarian beam of people who know you can fix many things with sugar and shelves.\n\nIrene came over afterward and introduced herself like someone who had drilled the introduction into a standard and then abandoned the standard for a handshake that actually meant yes. She had a streak of brilliant white through her otherwise dark hair and a nose that had been broken once in a story she didn\u2019t tell. She wore a shirt that said AVOIDABLE INCIDENTS ARE MY LOVE LANGUAGE and she handed June a packet of forms that groaned under the saddle of their own acronyms. \u201cI brought a simplified version,\u201d she said in a voice that had taught many men how to listen. \u201cWe will still need the unsimplified version. I will help you write the words they want to hear without making you lie. You\u2019ll give me a hazard analysis that looks like you know what wind can do to a person\u2019s best intentions. You\u2019ll show me a perimeter that\u2019s not just cones and hope. You\u2019ll tell me where your flame goes when it realizes it can\u2019t go where it wanted to. In exchange I\u2019ll keep the feds from loving you to death with concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what do you want besides the absence of paperwork sins?\u201d June asked, her eyes alive because here was a person who liked language and engines in equal measure.\n\n\u201cI want my kid,\u201d Irene said, nodding toward a lanky human in a black hoodie who was pretending not to be her kid near the young adult shelves, \u201cto see a woman in a welding mask be the cause of a road closure for a good reason. And I want to watch a room full of men recalibrate how they classify the sound of competence.\u201d\n\nThe signatures on Ron\u2019s clipboard were many and also, Lark noticed, the same six names written twice. Sita strolled past and said, casually and on purpose, \u201cRon, bring your dog to the test. If it barks at unusual frequencies we can calibrate your neighbor\u2019s wind chimes,\u201d and then kissed the baby on the temple and left the room fragranced with almond oil and a small future.\n\nTamara came back from Santa Fe with different hands. They were still her hands, strong and ornamental, but they seemed less in love with mess and more in love with the form that a mess dreams of becoming. She put her bag down in the hallway and hugged both the girls, making an equal sign of her arms, then stepped back to look at the line of ducks on the counter. \u201cYou could glaze these,\u201d she said, picking up one of the ceramic ones. \u201cYou could make a flotilla with a finish that would make anyone forgive anything. But I suppose forgiveness is not the real project here.\u201d She scratched her neck thoughtfully, which was a tell that she was remembering something she hadn\u2019t wanted to remember. \u201cDid I ever tell you about the kiln that failed the night before the gallery opening?\u201d she said, moving into a story like you move into a pool\u2014one foot, then the other. \u201cI had my pieces inside. I\u2019d named them like they were children. The firing stalled halfway and the glazes blistered. I cried like people cry over the truly lost. Then I took a shard to the light and it was somehow better for the accident. It reflected wrong. The owner of the gallery put it in the window and people came in for the shards. They called them honest. I wanted to punch everyone and also kiss them. That\u2019s how a near catastrophe sometimes behaves.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying you want the rocket to blister?\u201d June said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying I recognize the look on your face,\u201d Tamara said. \u201cAnd I know the high after the near miss. And I know the crash after the high. And I brought you both New Mexico candy that tastes like a church smells.\u201d She went to the cabinet precisely where she hadn\u2019t left anything and put away her mug as if she had never left at all.\n\nAt night, when the house was a small boat in a very friendly sea, Lark stood outside on the patch of concrete that had been chalk-painted a hundred times by a hundred small hands. The heat had gone out of the day and she could feel, if she let her skin do some listening, the way the neighborhood exhaled. She thought about the docuseries offers and the way a camera could make a feast of something and leave bones. She thought about her career which in certain circles was described as a list of intentional choices, when really it had been a series of doors opening because she was standing near them when someone else got tired of holding them up. She thought about the small boy by the pond who had somehow given her more kindness in ten seconds with his eyebrows than strangers on the internet had in several frustrated days. She did not think about ducks. She thought about speed.\n\nThe tests proliferated like small holidays. The town learned how to gather without demanding a parade. Children learned words that you do not need to know until you need to know them: ablative, thrust, throttle, abort. Irene stood with her arms folded like a general and learned the names of everyone under twelve within twenty feet of the tape. The tape was not really tape, it was a suggestion; the town obeyed because it likes being asked by a person who sounds like an answer. The prototype hopped again and again, each hop a new paragraph, each landing a small plausible grace. A man from the state called with a voice that said he had been asked to be mean. He asked questions as if the questions could be warmer if he held them long enough under his breath. June answered in two languages at once: the language of compliance, the language of honesty. Lark watched the transaction with a fascination she had once reserved for two actors who dislike each other kissing in one take.\n\nBetween hop days, life shrank and steadied. Lark went to the grocery store and learned again which aisle the beans were in, because in every town the beans are somewhere different based on the logic of a manager who has a quiet philosophy about legumes. She chose the independent film and read the script on the back steps, stopping sometimes to make her mouth practice saying the long lines with the kind of ease that would make them sound like borrowed everyday thought. The script was good enough to make her jealous of the writer in a way that felt like respect. The director called and asked her about hunger and silence. Lark told her about the ducks and then wished she hadn\u2019t, not because it made her smaller, but because it made her story sound like a hook on which people could hang what they already believed about her. \u201cNo animals,\u201d the director said, laughing softly. \u201cJust knives and soup.\u201d She meant the monologue, which had both.\n\nJune started keeping a failure budget in chalk on the wall, which was both a joke and a devotional practice. Under the words she wrote numbers that stood for how many times it would be allowed to go wrong before the going wrong meant stop. She ended the list with an arrow that pointed to a sheet of paper pinned neatly: CATASTROPHIC, which was a word you can\u2019t say out loud in a suburb without someone flinching. She flinched. Then she put her finger under the arrow like a lawyer making a case to a jury and said, \u201cWe won\u2019t go there.\u201d Tamara touched her face with two fingers like she was anointing her with the idea.\n\nWhen the third test day finally announced itself by arriving without apology, Westfield wore its best blue. The air was the kind that made old men say words like crisp and then mime the act of biting a fruit. Irene set out the perimeter like a prayer rug. She had orange markers and a tape measure and a certain stillness in her body that made children quiet themselves within radius. Pax brought the donuts again and also coffee that steamed like a promise. The mayor had learned and now wore flat shoes because she had turned her ankle at the last hop and then laughed about it in a way that made her instantly re-electable. Ron had brought his dog, a beagle who had eyes that apologized in advance for anything that might go wrong. There was blessedly not a duck in sight. It was as if the town had drafted a memo and sent it down to the pond shore asking politely for civic kindness.\n\nLark took her place by the cones with a half-familiar sensation, the one that came when a hundred eyes would roam over a room and then decide to stop on her because stopping on her made sense with the story they had brought. She was good at making that pause feel right. She let the story be the rocket, be the whoosh that was a possibility and not a promise. She kept her mouth shut the way she had learned to before takes so she didn\u2019t waste the breath she would need in the scene. She made her face into something that told children this was safe enough and told the old men this was serious. She did not look at the horizon because sometimes the horizon takes and sometimes it gives, and today she needed it to give.\n\nJune strapped on the helmet even though it wasn\u2019t a helmet yet so much as a habit. She ran her hand over the side panels the way you do when you love a thing you made, which is to say with a small motion that would not be noticeable if you did not know how to love. Sita stood five feet away with her hand on the kill switch because some friendships are built on the agreement that you will be the person who stops the thing before it becomes a story at a funeral. Irene caught Lark\u2019s eye and nodded once, the nod that says: this is the moment I earn my salary and you earn nothing and we both get paid in the same currency anyway.\n\nThe engine sounded like a creature clearing its throat kindly. It was not a roar yet; it was a request to the air to consider a new arrangement. Lark held herself very still in a way she had learned while holding seventeen-pound gowns on red carpets until her vertebrae sang. The rocket lifted the way a person gets up from a broken chair, careful, cheeky. A boy, maybe the one from the skate park, let out a yelp that made his mother put her hand on his head as if to keep his skull from flying off with excitement. June\u2019s eyes were not on the rocket. They were on her own instruments, the ones she had taped to the inside of her brain and the cheap ones wired to the side with zip ties. The thing rose higher than it had any right to and then hung in the way that makes you think time is a human invention, which of course it is.\n\nSomeone in the back of the crowd shouted, in that tone a certain kind of local man uses to keep time on his side, \u201cLook out!\u201d and several heads turned in the wrong direction because evolution still has a sense of humor. The wind shifted. It was the smallest betrayal. A leaf flicked from a maple and crossed through the plume like a dare. Lark braced because there are habits the body keeps and one of them is learning how to catch yourself before you fall in front of people. From nowhere and not nowhere at all, two mallards arrowed across the far end of the cul-de-sac, green heads small with distance, bodies cut tight like a bow on the idea. They chose the sky as the thing deserving of their morning and did not consult anyone\u2019s phobias or plans. Nobody but Lark saw them because the rocket had stolen the scene. She felt the old flicker inside\u2014a little harmless electrical storm\u2014and then she noticed, miraculously, that it didn\u2019t co-opt the rest of her. The fear had a seat with a belt on, just as June had promised. The rest of her kept its job.\n\nThe rocket stuttered, a half hiccup, and June murmured something to it that sounded like a lover\u2019s private encouragement. Sita\u2019s finger hovered just above the switch in the way of people who make choices with millimeters. Irene watched the arc with eyes that counted liabilities and sons. The beagle barked once and then put his head down, satisfied that he had said what any dog must say in the face of hubris and fire. Ron, perhaps against his will, let a grin flicker on his mouth like a contraband flame.\n\nIt climbed. It came back. It landed with a soft thud that you could describe to a person who loved baseball as a perfect catch. There was a beat where you could hear the small, precise glitter of metal cooling, and then the town made a noise that was equal parts fairground and church. Lark clapped and yelled and felt like her organs had arranged themselves in a way doctors would applaud. June lifted both fists and then softened, because one of the little kids started to cry from the suddenness of relief, and June is the kind of person who can shape adrenaline into a consoling hand in two seconds. She crouched and said, \u201cIt\u2019s loud because it\u2019s alive. Loud is not always bad,\u201d and the child hiccuped and imprinted a little on the idea.\n\nThe moment after a thing works is the most dangerous moment. This is a law. You can ruin a good cake by being too sure, you can ruin a marriage by assuming you\u2019ve already done the hard part, you can ruin a delicate truce with your own mind by thinking, finally, that you are free of the old alarms. June knew the law. She had written the law on the chalkboard under the failure budget. She redirected the adrenaline into the only ritual that keeps gods pacified: she did the checklist. She put a hand on a valve; she thanked it; she told Sita to cut power like it was a bedtime story. When she stood up, she didn\u2019t look toward cameras or the mayor. She looked at Lark and Lark did that thing with her mouth that millions of people had incorrectly read as a secret, a coyness. It wasn\u2019t coy. It was an attempt not to cry in public, and she failed at it completely.\n\nAfter, in the wake, when donuts were eaten with reverence and the baby slept through the congratulations and a boy asked if he could touch the scorch mark and then bragged to no one and everyone that he had touched the scorch mark, Irene took June\u2019s hand in both of hers in a gesture that made Lark\u2019s throat get soft. \u201cYou have something rare,\u201d Irene said. \u201cNot the metal. The quiet where the decisions live. If anyone tries to buy it from you, call me and I will bring you a baseball bat.\u201d She meant it. The mayor speechified briefly, using words like legacy and we which hit differently when you\u2019d watched her wince after stepping off a curb wrong and then laugh her way through the day. Ron put his clipboard down somewhere and forgot to pick it up. Pax Roscoe took the clipboard and wrote on it: LET THE RECORD SHOW, and then a smiley face, because sometimes the record needs punctuation.\n\nBy late afternoon, the town had put itself away in its usual drawers. The cones stacked. The signs went into the trunk of the mayor\u2019s car, where there were already three folding chairs, a jumper cable, a pair of heels, and a spoon. Lark\u2019s father started slicing melon. Tamara set glazes on the table like they were guests. June washed her hands with the exactitude of a surgeon and then, without ceremony, brought out a small box and put it in front of Lark as if she\u2019d been saving the gesture for when a place in the day opened where it could sit without clutter.\n\n\u201cI made you something,\u201d she said, in that tone that offered the thing and a small apology for the fact of it. \u201cIt\u2019s not a charm. It is not a talisman. If it works, it will work because you decide to let a thing work.\u201d\n\nInside was a necklace with a pendant the exact size of a clock face on a doll\u2019s wall. The pendant had been cut from a test scrap of the skin of the rocket, which gave it a brushed dignity. June had etched a circle on it and then the tiniest of notches along the edge, like a compass rose without the drama. In the center there was a small glass dome, and under the dome a sliver of something green and ridiculous that caught the light. \u201cWhat\u2019s the green,\u201d Lark asked, her voice doing that breaking thing it did when the moment got bigger than her ribcage permitted.\n\n\u201cA piece of a duck decoy,\u201d June said, her smile tilted. \u201cFrom the sporting goods at the thrift, because I refused to take anything from a real thing that didn\u2019t volunteer. I fixed it there, under the dome, so it can\u2019t look at you. You can look at it instead. Or not. If you don\u2019t want to wear it, don\u2019t. I will not be offended. I\u2019ll put it on the wall and call it art and say it\u2019s about the tension between fear and propulsion and then I\u2019ll charge five hundred dollars and some person will buy it because they think it will make them interesting. But I made it for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d Lark said, and then, because honesty does not have to be cruel, added, \u201cand beautiful.\u201d She fastened it. The metal was cool and then warm because that is what metal does when you give it the intimacy of skin. She felt not braver, exactly, but held. That was a dangerous word and also the correct one.\n\n\u201cDo we tell the internet,\u201d Denise asked over FaceTime that night, because even in Westfield the internet came to sit on the couch like an old aunt with opinions. \u201cDo we reveal the weird amulet. Do we give them a title card: The Actress And The Rocket Maker? Do I call the woman from Vogue who loves women in overalls?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever we tell them,\u201d Lark said, aiming the phone near but not at her actual face, \u201cwe tell them we are busy and any story they require has to fit between the parts where the work happens. We give them the picture of the scorch mark and a sentence that says, \u2018the point was not the landing, the point was the choice to light.\u2019 And then we go to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoetry,\u201d Denise said, mock-woeful and proud. \u201cI will make it into copy and pretend it was my idea and the cycle of our relational economy will continue. Are you ready for the indie film? They moved your dates up because their funding got skittish and then came back with a new tattoo. There\u2019s a kitchen scene where the block of knives is on the wrong side of the stove. Please do not fix it on set with your hands. We will get a note from props.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will stand very still and tell the truth as invented by someone with more patience than me,\u201d Lark said quietly. \u201cAnd then I will come back for the next thing June asks me to hold.\u201d\n\nThe night was deep in a way cities never allow. The frogs did their scalable symphony. Across the street, the teen drummer\u2019s timing had finally clicked, and he was trying triplets like a person who\u2019d been healed by repetition. The ducks at the pond were probably asleep with half their minds open, keeping an eye on something nobody could identify in broad daylight. Lark lay on her back in her old-not-old room and watched the ceiling fan do its slow three-blade sermon. The necklace sat at her throat. She touched the dome with one finger until her heartbeat found the glass and the glass said: yes, I hear you. She thought about how, as a child, she had believed the moon followed the car because she was in it, and how nobody had said, gently or not, that the moon had other business than her. Now, older, she believed the moon was following everyone because that is how light likes to behave when it hears laughing. She turned her head and saw the silhouette of the rocket through the blind, not a column of ambition anymore but the quiet shape of a thing that had done what it had promised for a day. She didn\u2019t know what the next day would demand. That was the mercy. The whole of the future would kill you if you had to carry it all at once. The next morning only asked for coffee, and an email to the director, and a joke for Irene about filing cabinets learning to breed if left alone, and a list of groceries you could get in town without anyone saying anything about anything except the weather.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d June said from the hallway because she was a person who believed in the spell of that word and said it like it could be carved. \u201cTomorrow we try fire on purpose again. Then after that, wind. Then after that, who knows, maybe we build a boat just to confuse people.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not give Ron a second petition subject,\u201d Lark said, her laugh hushed because the house was sleeping under blankets of time. \u201cBut fine. A boat. I want to learn stars enough to name the going.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now,\u201d June said, and Lark could hear her palms press together out of habit, \u201chold the light when I say the word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Lark said, and the way she said it closed the day with a click that felt like a lid fitting the right jar. She slept as if the world had been re-threaded around her with care, and if a duck passed through her mind it did so at a distance, a small green fact under glass, too busy paddling its half-dream to arrive at the shore of her.",

Flags decided to be important, backs of shirts breathed without permission, and every leaf on the block showed its paler underside like it was practicing vulnerability. June slept for three hours like a soldier and then came up from the garage with her hair in two braids and a list, the kind of list that contained both wrenches and strategies. Irene arrived with a coil of caution tape and a bright orange windsock that had clearly had a life on a real field somewhere, its mouth a perpetual surprised O. Pax rolled over a fan on a dolly that he had rebuilt out of a factory reject and an old airplane prop and he apologized to it in advance in case it was about to be asked to lie about the direction of the world.\n\nLark was fresh off a morning of pretending in a kitchen that wasn\u2019t hers. The independent film had found a house two towns over with pale blue cabinets and a view of a soybean field that made everything look like it existed for someone\u2019s nostalgia. The director, Mara, had set the knives block on the wrong side of the stove deliberately, and whenever Lark\u2019s hand reached for it the prop master\u2019s eyebrow would rise like a curtain warning. She kept her hand to herself and put the extra wanting into the way she looked at the actor playing her sister in the scene, who had the kind of coiled intensity that makes casting agents write her name with a little star. The monologue about soup had been shot in two takes because Mara disliked bravery wasted on practice. It had started as a woman describing broth and ended as a neat autopsy of a marriage, and Lark had felt the weight of the pendant on her sternum the way a person feels the suggestion of a seatbelt even when they are standing. When she was done, Mara had come in close and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s a gift when you let a line be ugly before it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d and Lark had nodded like a confession had just rearranged the bones in her face.\n\nShe got home just as the windsock decided west, almost, and a little lazy. June handed her a lemon popsicle without looking like she\u2019d planned it hours ago, and the sour chased the filming taste from her mouth so fast she laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fake wind first, and then we\u2019re going to beg the real stuff to show us its personality,\u201d June said, pointing with her popsicle as if it were a baton. \u201cPax\u2019s Frankenfan from the boneyard, Irene\u2019s sock, Sita\u2019s new handheld anemometer that I promised her I would not lick no matter how much it looks like a strange lollipop. We\u2019ll practice yaw control with no altitude so if we do something dumb we can call it deliberate.\u201d\n\nRon came by to let his dog sniff the cones as if the cones needed to be interrogated by law. He had found another clipboard, because the species reproduces, and this one had a printed sheet on top with the words CITIZENS FOR SENSIBLE SKY written in a font that tried to look like authority and looked instead like a sign for a discount carpet store. Parsons from Parks ducked his head in as well, a gentle man with tall ears who had the keys to the gates nobody else thought about. He said, \u201cWe got a call from a woman saying the ducks are showing signs of stress. She said it like it was a thing you can diagnose by looking at a picture on your phone of a bird that doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s being watched. I told her the ducks\u2019 primary source of stress is bread and teenagers. Then I told her I\u2019d come see for myself, which is me trying to be a modern man. Don\u2019t worry about your afternoon. Just\u2026 if any sound happens, keep it to a song where the chorus is brief.\u201d\n\nIrene took a moment to stand in the driveway and calibrate the air in her bones. She didn\u2019t check the forecast on her phone so much as confirm what her body already believed. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal,\u201d she said, not waiting to be introduced to the room that knew her now without ceremony. \u201cYour left is going to be a liar all day, so anything that wants to yaw left will do it more than it thinks it should. If you can, agree to make the dumb choice with speed instead of smart choice with doubt. Doubt gets you a bruise when wind\u2019s involved. We have a soft abort that\u2019s prettier than last week. Sita, that switch is your religion. Pax, if you plug anything into that power strip that wasn\u2019t on it this morning, I will make you write me an essay about cord ratings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the title of the essay,\u201d Pax asked, grinning in that way that men grin when a steady woman takes their tools away and they love her for it.\n\n\u201cHow to Not Burn Down Friendship,\u201d Irene said, and the grin went reverent.\n\nLark set the social world to quiet the way you dim a lamp by twisting, slow, until your fingers know where to stop. Denise had sent twelve messages in the last hour, even though it was a weekday and she should have had half an agency between her mouth and her thumbs. There were offers that used words like unscripted and authentic and journey, and there was one email from a streaming platform whose logo looked like something you would see on a skate shoe, promising a \u201climited series\u201d about two women and a town and a rocket that would \u201clean into the messy middle.\u201d Lark read the pitches and then closed her email because Irene had said doubt gets you a bruise, and she had enough already. She walked to the edge of the driveway and looked toward the pond without trying to make anything dramatic out of it. It was there, doing what water does in wind, which is to develop scales that catch light and make people talk like the water is breathing differently. She didn\u2019t see any ducks at that moment, which either meant they were elsewhere or that they were practicing being rocks, which is a talent the species uses for survival and mischief.\n\nThey staged the wind day like a play with no audience and as many understudies as possible. The fan roared and found its footing, Pax baby-talking it without shame until the prop found a groove that improved the mood of the cones. Sita had strapped the anemometer onto a broom so she could hold it in the actual path of the fake gusts without losing her hair. June squinted and then made herself open both eyes wide because she\u2019d written on the board that you see more when your face is not inventing a reason to make drama. The first gentle push of air tested a hinge; it juddered and then yielded like a polite uncle backing through a doorway. The second shove nicked a wire that hadn\u2019t been told the day\u2019s plan, and the wire complained by vibrating in a key that made Irene hiss and mark something on her clipboard that wasn\u2019t Ron\u2019s, a nicer clipboard with the corners taped to hold itself together in storms. By the third, June was adjusting in real time in a way that looked like dance, hands and shoulders and the numerical part of her brain making agreements faster than anyone could write them down.\n\nThen the wind Wendy\u2019d itself in for real, an indulgent swirl from the west, and June made the call to lift a foot off the ground. It was not altitude. It was a hover on a creaky barstool, the kind of lift that makes neighbors go, \u201cIs it\u2026 is it up,\u201d and then answer their own question with a helpful \u201coh.\u201d The cross-breath of the day hit the belly of the thing and the thing responded with a swagger, the ugly cousin of grace, wobbling with intent. Sita\u2019s finger didn\u2019t quake over the switch; it poised. Lark watched June watching her instruments and saw the moment the math and the mess parted company like good friends leaving a party at different times. A bolt on the lower port strut\u2014a bolt that had lived a quiet life until wind entered the chat\u2014settled into a new opinion of its purpose and decided, in classic hardware fashion, that it could travel. It didn\u2019t go far. It hopped like a rabbit who\u2019d read a book about parkour and then found itself in the world of real concrete.\n\nThe sound when the strut kissed the driveway was a sound you wouldn\u2019t include in a movie because the foley artist would say no one would believe a thing that small could make a noise that tired. It was a small tired sound, a complaint with a pinch of resignation, and it brought the test down hard enough that a piece of a panel\u2014light, but metal is always itself even when it\u2019s light\u2014flew off at an angle that would have made a geometry teacher clap with delight. It hit the edge of Ron\u2019s truck, which had been parked per Ron\u2019s insistence within the perimeter because it was his right to park on a public street he\u2019d been parking on since Carter. The panel left a dent the size and shape of a dull smile near Ron\u2019s wheel well, and the beagle barked as if its union contract demanded it.\n\nNobody screamed. Sita hit the switch with the love of a woman who knows stopping is a form of affection. June breathed in hard enough that her ribs showed\u2014Tamara\u2019s potter\u2019s instinct noticed even if nobody else would\u2014and then squatted to look at the bolt like she was a detective reading a confession. Irene\u2019s eyes did a quick inventory of children and men and mayor ankles and wires and wind, and then she took the clipboard and wrote in large letters: IMPROPER TORQUE PATH + WIND = STUPID. Pax killed his fan and petted it once, whispering, \u201cyou tried,\u201d as if he were putting a kitten to bed. Ron came forward slow, not because he was afraid but because you walk to a dent the way you walk to a piece of news. He bent, put his hand over the smile in the metal, pressed like he could persuade the truck to remember its previous face, then stood and sighed in a tone nobody expected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a truck,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes places where things bump into it. If I wanted it to be a statue I\u2019d park it in my living room and call it a day.\u201d He flicked the panel with his knuckles and watched the light go through it like it had been made to show off that trick. \u201cYou\u2019ll fix it,\u201d he added, and it wasn\u2019t a question. June nodded, almost bowed, because there are people it feels appropriate to bow to and one of them is the one who just decided not to make your mistake their headline.\n\n\u201cTorque plan was arrogant,\u201d June admitted, which was not the kind of sentence a person says at a town meeting. \u201cI built for perfectly vertical and then tried to teach sideways to become a courtesy. Sideways never becomes a courtesy just because you ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cSideways is my cousin\u2019s entire personality,\u201d Irene said, deadpan. \u201cI will mail you a new plan and I will also remind you, again, to let someone else check your body\u2019s math when you think the math is you.\u201d She pointed at Lark with the tone of a coach, not a critic. \u201cYou. Take her to walk while everyone un-primes their adrenaline. Look at things that aren\u2019t moving. Water, fine. Tree, better. Your own shoes, best.\u201d\n\nThey walked without pretending it wasn\u2019t because the adrenaline needed a place to dissolve. The wind had the bright taste of before a storm without the storm. The pendant sat quiet against Lark\u2019s chest as if it were listening to a story it had heard before and would hear again. They cut along the back way so as not to take the pond path, then turned in anyway because avoidance is a convincing god until it isn\u2019t. There was a boy practicing throwing a tennis ball against the low stone wall and catching it awkwardly, the social language of boys working out how to keep their hands in the world. There was a woman with a stroller talking to a man with a hat and neither of them saying what the conversation was really about, which is the music of small towns. The ducks were across the water near the reeds, subdued by the wind, heads tucked like old men on trains, and Lark watched them the way you watch weather you might need to drive in. They did not cross in front of her mind. They stayed pinned to their page. She breathed. June asked her about the filming, because June believes in rescue by detail, and Lark said, \u201cThe soup was onion, but I didn\u2019t cry until after, and then I cried the way you do when your body has been holding a door shut for an hour and somebody else finally puts their shoulder to the wood.\u201d\n\nJune nodded and picked a twig off a bush without hurting the bush and said, \u201cMara knows where the seam is between hunger and speech. Of course she put the knives on the wrong side. She was training your wrists to argue more quietly. Do you like your scene partner,\u201d and Lark smiled with her mouth more than her eyes because she didn\u2019t want to be cruel. She liked the girl fine, she liked the way the girl worked harder when no one was watching, but she did not like the hunger the girl had about Fame, which was a capital letter that eats its friends.\n\nWhen they came back, the present had decided not to become an emergency. Sita was holding the bolt under a lamp like it owed her money. Pax had the dent on Ron\u2019s truck halfway tamed with a plunger and the kind of good humor that makes a man a local treasure. Irene had her phone out because someone above her line of report had texted, and she was writing things with brevity and affection that would keep her and June both from being eaten by concern. Tamara had put out cut-up peaches with a squeeze of lime and people were using toothpicks in the way that makes them feel like they are taking part in a civilized compromise. The mayor came, saw the dent, saw June\u2019s face doing the thing her face did when she was making a mea culpa into a tool, and said, \u201cWe live here and so do our mistakes. If we start punishing anything that tries, we will end up a town of perfect lawns and nothing else.\u201d\n\nAfter the wind school, the internet tried to have its day. A Facebook group with a name like WESTFIELD REAL TALK posted a video that someone had slowed down and color-corrected until the plume looked unimaginably sinister, and a caption that said \u201cbirds terrified???\u201d with the kind of punctuation you can taste like a sour candy. Someone tagged Lark in a comment that read, \u201cwow, thought u loved animals,\u201d which was such an obvious trap the community college could have used it to teach rhetoric. Denise texted, \u201cWe can correct gently with a video of Irene explaining how ducks hear through skulls and how low frequencies work, with a graphic of a duck in headphones. Or we can ignore and the fire burns itself out because it\u2019s Saturday and there\u2019s a little league tournament, which is your town\u2019s natural resource.\u201d Lark sent it to June and Irene and asked for the hymn they wanted to sing and not the one the hecklers wanted.\n\n\u201cLet Irene sing,\u201d June said. \u201cBut make it about neighbors and decibels and the way we learn to share air. No cute. The minute you go cute about animals the world will demand you bottle it.\u201d\n\nIrene filmed a minute-odd video standing next to the windsock, speaking in the dry, declarative voice of a woman who has taught men not to die with fewer syllables than they expected. She explained SPLs and distance and how long the tests really ran and how no living thing in the vicinity had had its habits altered beyond a brief curiosity peck in the direction of the cones. Lark posted it without filter and with a caption that said, \u201cIf you have questions, ask us. We live here too.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a balm for everyone, but it gave the reasonable something to hold while the unreasonable tired themselves with misuse of commas.\n\nA package came that evening with a return address with NASA in it, the letters printed on the label like an official hand had been attached. Inside was a note in a looping hand addressing June by first name like the writer trusted the world to be smaller than it is. I sewed parachutes for years, the note said, in a sentence that made anyone who read it straighten their shoulders slightly without knowing why. We packed air like a prayer and then we packed fabric like the air had manners. People think courage is a moment, but it\u2019s a thousand stitches. I would like to send you a box of thread I can\u2019t use anymore because my fingers are getting honest about their age. It\u2019s strong and too pretty to hide. The signature was a name that Irene recognized because she put her hand over her mouth briefly, and then she said, \u201cShe used to stand two doors down from me in Mojave and tell the boys to move their coffee. The only person in that hangar whose voice could travel through aluminum and stay itself.\u201d\n\nThey ate pie again because their father had decided to turn his love language into a taper he could keep lit. After pie, he brought down a box from far back in a closet with the care a person uses for an object they have not told themselves is sacred so as not to tempt theft by fate. The box had old photos and the smell of closets that have seen winter coats hang themselves into shapes and then collapse into summer. There were pictures of Lark\u2019s mother that made the girls look like elongated versions of something fragile and ferocious, like a dragonfly wing sized up to a kite. There was a note in their mother\u2019s hand that Tamara hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d left behind, tucked in a book of household jokes like a woman\u2019s idea of camouflage. Luck is noticing the door and then deciding you deserve to test the knob, the note said, and Lark ran her two fingers over the ink like she was petting the idea. The wedding dress story got told, the Dairy Queen cone got remembered and embellished with the exact number of sprinkles because memory likes to be precise when it is lying with love, and nobody made grief into a performance because the house had learned over time to keep its dead very close and very gentle.\n\nThe first docuseries producer flew in and rented a car and used the phrase \u201ctasteful access\u201d in a way that made Lark picture a salad fork being introduced to her bedroom. He sat at Pax\u2019s radio shop to make his pitch because he believed in local color as a marketing strategy, and Pax sold him a pocket AM/FM while he talked as if in punishment for using the phrase \u201cnormal people\u201d within Irene\u2019s hearing. June listened to the man outline a schedule of tears and triumphs and then asked him if he knew the difference between a static test and a hop. When he did not, even after being told twice, she handed him the anemometer and an orange cone and said, \u201cI think you should stand in the backyard and see what the air believes. It\u2019s not going to make for good television, but it will make you a better animal.\u201d He did not like being made into a better animal by a woman in a t-shirt with scorch marks, and Lark, who had once pleased men like this for a living, felt the specific pleasure of letting someone else not please him.\n\nDenise, who could smell a deal in a different zip code by turning her head, called later and said, \u201cWe will say yes if and only if we get to control the time window, the crew count, and the refusal list. Your father will not be filmed waking up from a nap in his chair. Tamara will not be filmed in that way some shows like to film older women, with the camera too close and the light like punishment. Irene will be mic\u2019d only if she wants to be the day she wants to be, and if she says \u2018no\u2019 they will cut the audio and use birds. You, Lark, will not be asked to cry in a close-up for a time when a stiffness bolt goes missing. If any of this is a problem, I will personally write an email that uses the word exploitative so correctly that they will print it out and keep it under a rock.\u201d Lark said she would consider it and meant it in the literal sense, not the Hollywood sense where consider is another word for never.\n\nJune repurposed the rubber ducks\u2014which had taken over a corner of the living room like a bright militia\u2014by sticking straight pins with tiny flags into their backs and dropping them into a shallow tray to map turbulence. She poured water from a watering can with the spout turned to a trickle and watched the way the water learned to creep around obstacles like a mind finding another way to think around a fact. She labeled the ducks in marker\u2014Laminar, Vortex, Wake\u2014and Lark, catching sight of them like that, laughed in a way that wasn\u2019t brave or sad or branded. It was simply relief that even a thing that had frightened her so completely could be conscripted to show them where the air would try to go.\n\nThe boy with the eyebrows showed up with a screwdriver in his pocket and an expression that said he had been sent by twelve versions of himself to see if anybody needed him. His name was Eli, he said, and then he said, \u201cI know Eli is a name that makes you think of kids in old books being nice to women in bustles, but I can carry heavy and I know how to be quiet.\u201d He ran messages from the cones to the garage and back without assuming any of his own messages would be wanted. He drew a duck on the chalkboard, not with malice but because he was fourteen and funny, and then, seeing Lark\u2019s face flicker, he crossed it out and turned it into a rocket with a beak, laughing hard at his own apology. She let herself laugh too because the body wants to be forgiven for things it never did.\n\nThere were two days of rain that felt like a rehearsal for years they hadn\u2019t planned for. The town turned inward in that way that makes everyone learn the sound of their own dryer again. Lark shot nights on the indie in a kitchen lit to look like morning, the kind of trick filmmaking likes to play so the audience will feel warm and then not know why they are crying. During a setup where nothing would settle into the white balance everyone wanted, Mara leaned against the fridge and asked Lark about the pendant like she was asking why Lark wore a particular scar. Lark told her the short version\u2014a duck under glass, a sister making a compass, a problem made small enough to wear\u2014and Mara said, \u201cKeep it for the soup scene,\u201d even though the soup scene was done, because directors often mean keep it forever when they say keep it for a scene.\n\nOn the third morning after wind school, a letter came from the state with the tone of a person who didn\u2019t want to meet but would, and the word HEARING in capital letters like someone tried to make it shout from the paper. Irene read it, rolled her neck, and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go and we\u2019ll talk about the thing we\u2019re actually doing while they try to talk about the thing they are afraid someone will do with our name. Wear something with pockets. Bring a donut. I will make you three lists: what they want to hear, what we need to say, and what they\u2019ll actually remember.\u201d June sharpened a pencil with a pocketknife because sharpening a pencil with a blade is a mood and a choice. Lark asked if she should come and June said, \u201cYes, but not because you are\u2026 you know. You should come because you are very good at stopping a man whose story is about to confuse him. I want you to look at the room the way racks look at a runway. Pick three people and fill their hands with a reason to nod.\u201d\n\nThe hearing was held in a building with carpet that had been installed during a decade when gray was code for serious, and it smelled like everyone\u2019s coats, layer upon layer. A panel sat under a row of flags as if they were expecting a parade to enter if the answers weren\u2019t satisfactory. Two men asked questions in the tone of a dentist explaining the economy of floss. A woman with exquisite eyeliner asked about combustible zones with a curiosity that suggested she had burned things under appropriate supervision before. June spoke in sentences that did not apologize for their own breath. Irene fielded changes of subject the way you field bees you do not want to harm and do not want in your hair. Lark watched the back row, where the man who would write the brief leaned against the wall and tried to pretend he made the shape of a telephone pole. She aimed every yes toward his peripheral vision, because sometimes people are proudest of the things they did not notice they learned.\n\nOn the way back, June drove because her hands needed a task and Lark watched the fields do what fields do after rain, which is to shine with gratitude and pretend it is their doing. They saw a line of cars stopped in both directions near the pond and for a moment Lark thought something had gone wrong with a child or a dog or the duck that had yet to be forgiven for simply existing in her mind. It wasn\u2019t a horror. It was an old small ritual. A row of mallards hustled across the road, their bodies smug with purpose, and the drivers of Westfield did the thing the town taught them to do: they sighed and waited and then told the story later like the ducks did it just to test whether humanity still deserved to be trusted with steering wheels. Lark put her hand to the pendant because she is not a woman who makes herself ache out of stubbornness, and then she watched the green heads bob, one, two, seven, and let the fear tap her like a stranger trying to be introduced. It tapped. She nodded. She looked away deliberately toward the creek that ran under the culvert, and in her peripheral vision she could feel the flock pass and the world resume.\n\nJune touched her arm once, nothing a camera could have captured without being accused of adding a violin. \u201cSeatbelt tight,\u201d June said, as if they were at thirty thousand feet and someone had broken out a harmonica in the next row. Lark smiled and tried to see herself from the outside and then stopped because that is a trick that eats the day.\n\nDenise called with the inevitable contract. Fallon wanted them next Thursday, remote to begin with, a segment from the library lawn with the sculpture-that-was-a-rocket framed so the sponsor wouldn\u2019t complain about free advertising for something the town hadn\u2019t yet branded. \u201cThey will go easy,\u201d Denise promised in a voice that contained both skepticism and love. \u201cThey will ask you about sisters. They will ask you about fear. They will ask you to hold a rubber duck they will pretend to produce as a joke and then reveal it is a candle, not a toy, which their legal told them is okay. They will not send live poultry because their intern has your email where you wrote \u2018do this and I will replace all your curls with bees.\u2019 Pick your shirt. Pick your line you\u2019ll say when they laugh in the wrong place. Don\u2019t pick a fight with America on a Thursday.\u201d\n\nThey said yes because some hells are useful bridges. Lark wrote her lines and then deleted her lines because Mara had reminded her that truth dies when you pre-dig the grave too neatly. June wrote an index card and then tore it in half and then used the halves to shim a fixture in the garage because paper can be a tool even when it refuses to be a guide. Irene called a friend at the network to say, quietly, that if any surprises occurred during the segment she would appear in New York uninvited with a bar of soap and a mom voice. Pax polished the face of his ham radio in case any of the high schoolers wanted to try to bounce a signal off the ionosphere during the commercial break, which feels magical even when you know the math. Tamara made glazes and then pretended to be outraged by the very idea of TV and then paused Astronaut Wives to watch an old clip of Sally Ride, because we are all hypocrites when someone brave is on.\n\nThat night, before sleep, the house settled like a ship in friendly water. Lark lay awake with the fan marking time and the necklace warming to the temperature of her hope. She thought about the shape of Thursday and how it could either take a piece of her or put something back. She thought about the state hearing and the panel and the woman with eyeliner and the way June had learned to cut the size of her explanations in half only to make them twice as clear. She thought, for a small, superstitious minute, about the version of herself who had stayed in a city that isn\u2019t a town and had learned to wear fear like a fashionable bracelet and then had to get it cut off in a back room with a snip that hurt anyway. This version of her had gotten a different story, one with wind and a welding mask and a beagle who barked when the world had the audacity to do something interesting near his parking spot.\n\nThe next day, June said they were going to try the thing Irene had called ugly-fast. It meant catching a yaw with intentional overcorrection before overcorrection became a cartoon. It meant letting the body\u2019s own flinch be the first part of the math and not the enemy. It meant if a part she thought she loved failed, she would let it fail loudly and replace it with something plainer and better. Lark didn\u2019t have anything to hold during that. She didn\u2019t have a flashlight or a donut or a boy to distract by asking him to carry cones. Her job was to stand at the edge of the shade and say \u201cyes\u201d with her face to all the eyes that would look up when the thing made a sound that made the town remember how anything new demands an organ. She thought of the indie film and the soup and the knives and the delicate trick of pretending to cut and not cutting, because of continuity. She thought of a sentence her mother had written in a book and how she had gotten to test the knob, not as a girl in heels at a party but as a woman in sneakers at a driveway.\n\nThe first ugly-fast scare was small, because fate is sometimes tender when it wants to train you. A cough became a hiccup became a tilt and then Sita breathed once and cut power and the object came down like a cat rolling off a couch with dignity intact. The second was less polite, rattling a bracket loose with a zing that made Eli grin like the universe had just sent him a lesson in how music is made of mistakes. June tightened the bracket and then shook her head and took it off and put on something thicker and made a note to write a thank you card to the friend who had given her the thinner bracket because gifts have their place but not all places need gifts. The third grew in grace out of stubbornness, ugly and then pretty and then genuinely itself, a balanced demand that the wind meet it halfway. Lark felt inside her chest the smallest of the sparrows that used to slam themselves against glass go, suddenly, a less frantic route to a windowsill.\n\nAfternoon brought a quiet between weather fronts, and in that quiet Denise texted a photograph, the kind agents send when they want to use the visual to get you to answer the phone. It was a shot of a billboard mocked up with two silhouettes, a rocket and a woman in a welding helmet, and across it the words THE CORWIN EFFECT in a font that tried to look expensive. Lark called before Denise could ring, the kind of preemptive strike she\u2019d learned from years of being managed lovingly. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, which she tried to cushion with breath. \u201cNo to that name, no to that possessive. It\u2019s not mine to be named after. No to the thing where the woman gets credit for being brave when what she\u2019s been is stubborn and correct. If anything gets named, the town gets a plaque, and the plaque says this street put up with this. This driveway did this. This wind was here and didn\u2019t blow us down.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Denise said, sounding not at all bruised and a little delighted, because people think agents like to win more than they like to be aligned with rightness and sometimes that isn\u2019t true. \u201cI had that made to see if you would spit it back at me. You did. Tomorrow wear the shirt with the tiny scorch mark you like and the boots that make you look like you build the things you talk about. Tell Fallon a story where even he has to be quiet for a second. I\u2019ll keep the rest safely off your day.\u201d\n\nEvening brought the pond back into their periphery because Westfield doesn\u2019t know how to be itself if you don\u2019t take its water into account. They walked there again the way you walk a word to make sure it fits in your mouth, and this time, because the world is sometimes kind in exactly the small way you require, there were no ducks close to the path. There were only soft rings of insects on the surface of the water, and a girl in a yellow dress with mud on her ankles showing her mother how Minnows Do This, and a teenage boy lying on his back on the grass with his eyes closed, using the earth on purpose. June watched the sky the way you look at someone who is going to leave you and you love them anyway. Lark watched June watch the sky and holy things, which is how adoration gets to be useful when you don\u2019t climb it up onto an altar and make it formal.\n\nOn the night of Fallon they did something that felt like it shouldn\u2019t matter and therefore mattered. They ate scrambled eggs at five in the afternoon. They used the thick bread and the sort of ketchup that pretends to be grown-up by having less sugar. They were quiet in the kind of way that doesn\u2019t come from fear but from not wanting to break the good dishes inside the hour. Irene put on lipstick and then wiped it off, applied chapstick like armor, and told Eli that if he made one face at the camera behind the camera she would assign him to coil hose for a week. Tamara kissed everyone without counting so as not to miss.\n\nThe satellite truck the network sent parked two houses down because their wheels were rude to curbs. A young person with headphones and grace set up a camera so the library and the not-yet-sculpture would both fit. The producer, who had been told about Irene and bats and consequences, shook hands like the handshake was a lease. Fallon\u2019s face appeared in a rectangle on a stand in front of them, a thin man in a suit who had been blessed with sincere eyes and a makeup artist who knew about laughing lines. He did a warmup for them the way you do when you are about to talk a group into doing something and want them to like you for it. He asked if they liked Westfield and said he\u2019d once bought a couch from their mall and was it still a mall or had the malls become hospitals yet. June said, \u201cWe like our mall like we like our dentists: we pretend to dread and then we thank it and go back every six months,\u201d and Lark could see the exact moment a person on a late-night show realized they were going to get a different kind of segment than the one they had slotted.\n\nThe questions were what they were, softened by an intern who had been given a list of what not to say and had taken it seriously. There was a joke about ducks that Lark met with a smile and a one-sentence sermon about brains and seatbelts and how we don\u2019t have to be brave in the way that looks good to strangers. There was real time for June to say out loud, on a big long string of pixels that would hit televisions and phones like rain, that she wanted to build a series of doors the town could brag about letting people walk through. Fallon did the move with his eyebrows he does when he hears a sentence he can add to his own private collection of reasons to be proud of his species. He ended by asking what they would name the rocket and June answered before anyone could turn it into a vote. \u201cI\u2019m not naming the rocket,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pet. It\u2019s a verb.\u201d\n\nThey signed off and the town clapped at a TV they could have thrown a tennis ball at if they wanted. Denise texted twenty heart emojis and a spreadsheet screenshot because balance is everything. Irene exhaled like she\u2019d been holding three forms open in her mind for the length of a pop song. Pax borrowed the headphones from the young person and listened to the station chatter like a man at church listening to an organ warm up. Ron brought over his beagle and said, \u201cHe liked it. He\u2019s a critic and he liked it,\u201d which was the kind of benediction that didn\u2019t need religion to work. Lark went outside to the driveway and stood on the scorch mark and didn\u2019t make a wish because that would have made it smaller. She just stood there and let the day pat her down for contraband and find none.\n\nWhen the house finally went quiet, the wind had given up on itself for the day and left the trees to practice stillness. Lark found June in the garage, cleaning the same small area with a rag the way you do when cleaning isn\u2019t about clean. The pendant had carved its little weight into Lark\u2019s collarbones in the way of familiarity. She touched it without theatrics and said, \u201cYou called it a verb,\u201d as if she hadn\u2019t heard the line and clapped like every other American in a soft chair.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want something I can set on a mantel,\u201d June said. \u201cI want something that argues with sky and comes home for dinner.\u201d She looked up and her eyes were so bright they were almost rude. \u201cTomorrow, wind again. Then the slow low hover, no lift, push into ugly, stay, breathe. If it keeps saying yes, then after that\u2026 I think we try the high fence. Pax says it\u2019s a bad metaphor, but I want my body to know we can clear a line that looks like the edge of permission.\u201d\n\nLark nodded, loving a new piece of vocabulary without asking where it would sit. She thought of all the fences she had not tried to clear and all the hedges she had walked around politely. She thought of ducks asleep in their one-eyed way, guarding their half-worlds. She thought of audiences invisible and visible, and which one she owed what on any given Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ll hold the light,\u201d she said, because it had become their liturgy. \u201cI\u2019ll hold it until you say stop. Then I\u2019ll put it down very gently so it doesn\u2019t remember my hand.\u201d\n\nThey turned the garage lights off together and the rocket\u2019s silhouette stayed in the room anyway, because things you make insist on being present even when you don\u2019t indulge them. In the dark June\u2019s hand found Lark\u2019s elbow for one second, the smallest of moorings, and Lark thought that maybe she could learn stars after all, not to own them or to keep them, but to call the going by something other than luck. She went to bed and didn\u2019t count ducks. She counted breaths until the night untied itself from her carefulness and pulled her under like water does when it likes you back.",

                              "content": "Chapter 7\n\nMorning arrived as if it had written itself a schedule. The sun hit the lemon tree first, then the garage door, then the rectangle on the kitchen floor that marked where someone should stand if they wanted to be bathed in something like approval. The house knew what was planned without being told. June\u2019s lists had reproduced overnight: one pinned to the chalk wall, one tucked under a magnet shaped like a chili pepper on the fridge, one written on the back of a takeout menu in a hand that had grown narrower and more impatient as the ink ran low. Irene had texted at dawn to say the air would be cooperative until lunchtime and then would go sideways in fits, like a child who had decided naps were an insult, and that if they wanted to try \u201cthe high fence\u201d they should do it while the wind was still pretending to be a citizen.\n\nIt turned out \u201cthe high fence\u201d wasn\u2019t a literal barrier so much as an agreement about height. June and Sita had rigged a line across the cul-de-sac at a cautious distance with pennants made from strips of an old caution tarp and the corners of the girls\u2019 childhood sheets. The pennants did a small bright dance in the breeze like an old-fashioned celebration trying very hard to be modern. Pax had brought sawhorses because he believed in the morale value of staging. Eli dragged the sawhorses to flank the line like bouncers who had been given a clip-and-store lecture by Irene on what to allow and what to shame. The mayor had sent two city employees whose job title was listed on their shirts as \u201cGeneral Utility,\u201d and both of them wore it the way a cape is worn when you don\u2019t want to be accused of pretending to be a hero.\n\nLark made coffee and decided to make eggs again because the eggs had been good luck. She salted them with her fingers and wiped her hands on a towel that had survived three kitchens and one fire and refused to die. The pendant rested in its place, warming against her skin as she moved, and she thought of the way June had pressed the tiny green sliver under glass like a joke and a mercy. For a long time, fear had felt like a noisy guest who refused to leave. Now, it felt like a tenant with a lease. She didn\u2019t like it, but she knew when it would pay its rent.\n\nShe walked to the garage and found June in \u201cpre-check prayer,\u201d which is what Tamara had started calling the way she moved around the machine touching, not quite touching, calling out the names of things like a mother counting heads. Sita had the torque wrench in both hands and a look on her face that said she had recently won an argument with herself and kept it. Irene sat on the stool near the whiteboard with her legs crossed and a clipboard balanced on her knee. She had drawn a small crown on the top of the page where the word \u201cwind\u201d had been written, a private joke she hadn\u2019t checked with anyone else. \u201cWe go ugly fast only if pretty fails and only once,\u201d she said without looking up. \u201cThen we don\u2019t get addicted to the drama of the save. The drama is seductive and will steal your wallet.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d June said, and then, because she knew herself and the way her hands liked to believe they could save anything, she said it again. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\nRon appeared with the beagle and a ratchet strap like a man attending to both sides of his personality at once. The strap, he informed anyone who\u2019d listen, had held a canoe on his nephew\u2019s Subaru through three seasons and one incident with megawind up by the quarry; it could hold a panel respectful if it had to. He handed it over with an eye on the pennants and an expression that said he had already rehearsed two stories to tell at the diner later: one in which nothing happened and he was gracious, one in which everything happened and he was also gracious. The beagle sniffed the chalk like it had a long-ago secret with calcium.\n\nDenise had promised not to send anyone with a lens without warning, and she kept her promise. A lens arrived anyway, the kind that floats attached to four arms and a battery and a remote operator who stood in the shade of a maple as if shade were a legal argument. The drone tried to find a lane through the trees and the pennants as though it believed in the primacy of its mission, which was to gather light and sell it. Irene spotted it in the way you spot a wasp at a picnic\u2014calm, immediate, already adjusting the food. She walked to the maple tree with the kind of authority that doesn\u2019t need to be turned up and spoke to the operator without raising her voice. Lark watched from the driveway and saw the exact moment the operator recalibrated the shape of the trouble he was in and decided to land his machine like it had been his idea to do so.\n\nWhen the cones went up, a small congregation formed of its own accord. Two teachers from the elementary school came on their planning period with coffees and the faces of women who have learned to love a well-run line. The librarian wore a denim shirt and joy. Pax\u2019s cousin\u2014who had a name that sounded like an old story, Abel\u2014leaned against his truck and looked like he was practicing how to accept responsibility for more than his share of any future that required fixing. Tamara emerged, wiped clay from the heel of her hand onto her jeans in a way no one else could do without looking performative, and tucked a scrap of hair behind her ear that had been stubborn since Santa Fe. Lark\u2019s father stood back with a towel over one shoulder like he\u2019d forgotten he wasn\u2019t in charge of a grill and would never be again.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d June said, and the word held as much bravado as it could without spilling. \u201cWe clear the line or we don\u2019t. No one gets a medal for altitude. We\u2019re collecting proofs of control. Irene calls abort; Sita calls abort; I call abort, and any one of those is the spell that gives us cake later. If Ron calls abort I\u2019ll pretend not to hear him unless he uses the voice he used on me when I was eight and decided to teach myself brakes on a dirt hill.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s mouth twitched and he considered making the face, then decided to save it for when it would be needed.\n\nThe first lift was nothing dramatic, which is to say it was perfect. The thing hung just above the driveway and considered the pennants in the same way a cat considers a glass of water\u2014interested, polite, vaguely threatening. June\u2019s hands did their quiet choreography above the throttle and the yaw control, and Irene watched the windsock and counted under her breath like numbers could be taught to hum in key. The machine inched up as if guided by a string only June could see, and the line dipped to the right as a puff of afternoon from across the park decided to register its displeasure. Sita\u2019s finger hovered, loving the possibility of a moment she wouldn\u2019t have to make.\n\nIt cleared by inches that felt like narrative. The pennants did not catch. A strip of the old sheet flapped joyously and then settled as if it had not just measured the distance between permissibility and regret. The crowd did a small collective sigh because humans are incapable of saving their breath when a thing that needs it is in the room. June\u2019s face didn\u2019t move, but something in her shoulders closed a tab. Lark had the odd sensation of the pendant cooling and heating at once, as if the tiny green thing under glass were registering the air in the room and agreeing to behave.\n\nThen the wind remembered what town it was in and performed a trick. It found a corner of the cul-de-sac where the warmth from the asphalt leaned up into the cool, which is a recipe for mischief. The machine drifted in the way a determined person drifts when questioned\u2014only slightly, with annoyance. A garbage can down the block clacked its lid at the wrong time and a child coughed and a beagle decided to issue a single bark in the language of critique. The yaw went sideways quickly, ugly the way a clever person is ugly when they are tired and think they can fake it. Sita\u2019s chin dipped; Irene\u2019s eyes changed tempo; June let herself be the quick version of her careful and tapped a correction that was more like a flick than a push. The thing shuddered and shook out the anger and righted. Later, everyone who had been there would describe it differently and use their hands. In the moment, Lark registered it as a feeling you remember from a particular childhood fall: when your knee met gravel and you didn\u2019t go down because your body found a way to say, not today.\n\nThey settled, did a checklist with the gravity of a prayer in a language nobody begrudges, and brought it down. People clapped in that way communities clap when they\u2019ve agreed not to name what they\u2019re praising because naming would make it smaller. Pax let out a yelp and then apologized to Irene for volume in a school zone; Irene said he could yell twice more as long as one of the yells was in metric. Ron exhaled like a tractor turning off. Eli\u2019s hands vibrated in sympathy with the fans; Sita handed him a thing to hold that felt important so he would stop vibrating. Lark realized she was crying and let her face do it without the magazine version of the motion, because nobody had cameras but the kind you carry under your ribs.\n\nThey reset for a second try because no one knows how to quit when the day is this willing. During the setup, a woman who owned the hair salon on Main\u2014the one that still had a photo of a 1998 prom cluster in the front window\u2014sidled up to Lark and touched her elbow and said, \u201cYou made me laugh on the TV last night and then I cried because I thought about the way I used to hold my breath in church and I think I finally stopped. If you need the back room of the salon to keep your things that boys with papers want to photograph, tell me. I can put it next to the perm rods. They\u2019ll never look there.\u201d She smiled with a mouth that had fixed a thousand people for a thousand weddings and meant it.\n\nThe drone operator came back without the drone, hands in his pockets like he had learned to be on the side of humans. He apologized to Irene without sounding sorry he\u2019d been caught, and asked if he could stand by the cones and just watch if he promised not to turn anything on. Irene gave him a look that could tune engines and then said, \u201cYou can stand by Pax. He will tell you about meters. If you say the phrase \u2018content verticals\u2019 near my cones I will give you a math test.\u201d He stood by Pax and learned to nod on the beat.\n\nThe second lift was the one that tried to take their good will and turn it into hubris. June knew it as it happened, the way you recognize an old friend from far away and also recognize that their current mood will require you to stop them from making a speech. The machine rose and flirted with the line, then tipped its shoulder with a kind of swagger it had not been given permission to try. The correction that would serve pretty was past. Ugly-fast beckoned: the decisive, unlovely, extremely human move that says we mean to continue. June chose it before the invitation was fully written. She turned the control with a firmness that would have insulted someone who didn\u2019t want to be told what to do and the machine obeyed in the way obedient things obey when they trust the voice that asks. The clearance was not handsome. It was effective. Pennants snapped into shape and then fell, chastened. The town cheered less loud this time because it had learned that sometimes the best applause is the sound you don\u2019t make when the person you love is doing something delicate.\n\nThey brought it down and June sat, which she doesn\u2019t do if she can help it. Tamara pressed a bottle of water into her hand and then touched the back of her head like checking for fever. Irene put a finger on the line of June\u2019s wrist for a pulse and then pretended to be interested in a bolt so June wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed by the intimacy. Lark sat on the curb because she needed to and the curb did what curbs do for people who have sat on them in many versions of their lives: it made a kind of sense.\n\nThat afternoon, while the tools cooled and the windsock made up its mind and the town found its chores again, the indie film called and asked for Lark at dusk on a porch with a screen door, the kind of porch that keeps secrets by creaking. Mara said the daylight had gone flimsier earlier than expected and they wanted to steal a scene while the sky knew how to keep its blue. Lark said yes to the stealing because it meant she could say no to something else later with the coin she\u2019d earned, and because her days were now stitched out of choices that felt less like averting punishment and more like leaning toward usefulness. She drove there with June\u2019s voice in her pocket saying things like \u201ctorque path\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t let pretty fool you,\u201d and she used those phrases on a paragraph that wanted to be too clean. The scene snapped into focus because she let herself say a line badly on purpose before she said it right, and Mara\u2019s face did the grateful thing it did when someone trusted her enough to risk being seen with their mask half down.\n\nWhen she returned, the house smelled like oranges and something that could have been sorrow if you weren\u2019t careful. Her father had fallen asleep in the chair in the back room, his head tipped, the towel still on his shoulder like a friend. The radio hummed in the background with a public voice discussing drought plans in a tone like a bedtime story. There was a short list on the end table written in his hand\u2014eggs, mulch, call dentist\u2014that had a blank space in the middle where something had been meant to go. Lark stared at the blank and felt the cold reach that certain omissions perform. She put her finger in the space and said the names of things that might fit in a voice that could be mistaken for reading out loud to herself: batteries, beans, June. He woke without alarm, smiled, and said, as if picking up a conversation they had always had, \u201cI always forget batter, not eggs,\u201d and she let it slide because mercy sometimes means keeping a full back pocket of illusions within arm\u2019s reach.\n\nLater, over bowls of something Tamara called stew and June called fuel, Irene told a story in the low, matter-of-fact voice she only used when she wanted to offer herself up as a reason and not a standard. In Mojave there had been a day when wind had gone from idea to person, and a friend had tried to show it what kind of person he was. He had not been stupid, he had been sincere. He had carried calculation in his mouth and faith in his flinch and he had lost anyway, not his life, not that story, but a capacity for arrogance that he had not believed he possessed. \u201cHe is gentler now,\u201d she said, which is a sentence that includes an elegy the way a stream includes the idea of rocks. \u201cHe builds less tall and more wide, and he lets the second idea be a long time coming. We are not those people and I am not asking us to be them. I am asking us to tell the truth to our own trouble before someone else\u2019s trouble hears us lying and tries to teach us a lesson.\u201d\n\nJune listened the way she listens to forms\u2014pen ready, eyes kind. \u201cTomorrow no height,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do discipline school. We do ugly on a leash until ugly stops pretending it knows better than me. We do torque again with a friend looking over my shoulder so I don\u2019t become one of those cautionary fonts on a flyer.\u201d\n\nThe docuseries producer sent an email with softened edges and the phrase \u201cwe want to honor your boundaries.\u201d Denise replied with a paragraph that was polite and covered in tiny blades and included three non-negotiables and a line about tune-in times that used the word \u201cadjacency\u201d like a loaded pistol. It would be ridiculous if it weren\u2019t also an act of protection. Lark forwarded the email to June who wrote back, a minute later, \u201cI wish your work didn\u2019t have to be this. I am grateful that your work is this.\u201d Lark stared at the sentence for longer than the screen needed and then turned her phone over and let it be a face-down insect on the table.\n\nThe town\u2019s high school invited June and Lark to speak in the auditorium that had hosted too many assemblies about vaping and not enough about propulsion. The principal wrote an email that sounded like an apology for the fluorescent lights and the way kids now are always tired and asking for accommodations like joy. They went, because saying yes to the kids is the only yes that should outrank safety and sleep. In the auditorium, the microphone made its small betrayal squeal and the teenagers made their larger, more merciful one, which is to be more generous than anyone expects as long as you don\u2019t tell them they\u2019re being generous. June brought a bolt and a bracket and held them up and said, \u201cThis holds because these threads agree to hold and because I don\u2019t lie to them about their job,\u201d and three kids in the third row sat forward like they had heard their own names. Lark told the knife-and-soup story because it had become the true thing she could tell without folding in on herself, and at the end a girl with the beginnings of a mustache and the ending of her patience raised her hand and said, \u201cSo you were afraid of ducks, like for real, and you didn\u2019t fix it but you did something else,\u201d and when Lark said yes, there was an audible feeling in the room, not quite a sigh, not quite a laugh. It sounded like permission granted without a ceremony.\n\nOn their way out, a boy with two different sneakers and a shy phone asked to take a picture. He held the phone up as if to trap them and then lowered it slowly instead. \u201cI want to remember you with my eyes,\u201d he said, mortified by his own sincerity, and then he ran away. Irene, who had come along to count fire exits and columns, laughed as if a bee had politely refused to sting her and said, \u201cTown is making itself a very weird church.\u201d\n\nThe weather rolled a bruise across the sky one morning and the texts started: are you doing it anyway, did you see the radar, is this a sign, should I bring my aunt who loves storms. June sent back a small, clean no and then a longer explanation about electricity and luck and how the cost of a day can be measured in two currencies and how she refused to go broke in either. Ron wrote \u201cgood call\u201d under her post on the WESTFIELD REAL TALK group and three men with the word \u201creal\u201d in their profile names argued about whether caution was a plot. Pax posted a photograph of the windsock lying reproachfully on the grass like an exhausted fish with the caption, \u201ctomorrow,\u201d and people clicked little hearts because hope is the internet\u2019s only real use.\n\nOn a day when the sky decided to be hospitable and June\u2019s list had been satisfied with three checkmarks and a small offering of sweat, the high fence became the low fence and then no fence at all. They took the pennants down, because sometimes the presence of the obstacle makes you hit the obstacle on principle. June announced that she had a new favorite thing to say: \u201cweight growth budget,\u201d which meant she was allowed to add a pound of wiring and a handful of caution and still be within the promise she\u2019d made herself when she decided she wouldn\u2019t let the machine become a sculpture too soon. Lark thought about the phrase like an allegory she could try on her life and then put back on the hook for return later.\n\nAfter dinner, Tamara invited everyone to the studio again because clay had become her weather. She unveiled the angry vase from Santa Fe and placed it on a table and then a taller, more complicated vessel she had made since, glazed in a color that could not decide whether it was pond or sky. \u201cI told my class,\u201d she said, wiping her hands on a towel that had known intimately the idea of grit, \u201cthat we make containers for what we can\u2019t hold, and if we are lucky the thing we couldn\u2019t hold finds a shape that looks like itself, and we discover we can hold it after all.\u201d She put the vase and the vessel side by side, let them look at one another the way siblings look when the adults leave the room, and then slipped her arm through both of the girls\u2019 unwilling elbows and held on.\n\nLate that week, the production company with the tasteful access wrote back agreeing, unbelievably, to every demand with four caveats that Denise sent back capped with four no\u2019s and two alternate suggestions and a budget revision that somehow made numbers feel like a language for covenants instead of tricks. Irene had the last word, which was not like her, and the word was \u201cpilot only,\u201d because she did not believe in seasons in life or television until she had evidence for them. June drew a small box on the chalkboard and wrote inside it: only if we still get to say stop. Pax brought over an old red light from a theater junk sale and mounted it on a post near the garage door. If they flicked it on, it meant the crew, any crew, was a no. If it wasn\u2019t lit, it still could be a no. \u201cSometimes I like you best when you are predictable about being complicated,\u201d Lark told her sister, who bowed then, ironically, to the red light like it had asked for her autograph.\n\nThat Saturday, the town woke ready to spend its attention. The farmers market put out early strawberries that tasted like effort. The cafe set up a table outside with a sign that said \u201cRocket Fuel\u201d in chalk and then in parentheses \u201ccoffee, we mean coffee.\u201d A band with a banjo practiced two doors down and then practiced again with less banjo. The high fence day without fence had settled into their bones as a story they could tell in either direction\u2014\u201cremember when we almost\u201d and \u201cremember when we did.\u201d Lark walked past the pond with Tamara who had decided to count the turtles like a researcher one might pay if one were interested in the daily complicities of suburban wildlife. A small boy stood on the low bridge with a slice of bread his mother had given him because she had not read the sign, and Lark, trying not to make anything more dramatic than it needed to be, stood with them and used her movie voice, the soft one that makes people lean in, to say, \u201cYou see how they\u2019re pretending to be hungry for bread but really they need bugs and green stuff and things that wiggle. They\u2019ll take that bread and say thank you and then their bodies will be confused and sad. It\u2019s a weird trick we learned to play on them. What if we tricked them in the other direction and threw peas?\u201d The mother looked at the sign and then at Lark and made a face like she\u2019d been caught but was grateful. The boy whispered \u201cpeas\u201d as if it were a secret password. Tamara said, \u201cI have peas,\u201d because of course she did, and the three of them stood there flicking green coins and being thanked by a rush of water and small beaks. When they walked away, a teenage couple took their place, and the girl said, \u201cYou know who that was,\u201d and the boy said, \u201cSomeone nice,\u201d and for once that was the answer.\n\nIn the late light of Sunday, June brought the machine out for what she insisted was not a test and Irene called \u201ca behavioral exercise\u201d and Pax called \u201cchurch,\u201d which the mayor tried once to second and then withdrew because she did not want to irritate constituents. They practiced hovering low until Irene could look away for a full three breaths without thinking she would be punished by a coincidence. They mapped the effect of a bicycle passing at speed two streets over because there is no such thing as too much superstition that can be measured. Eli asked if he could hold the anemometer without the broom and Irene let him, watching him watch numbers become wind, which is a small sort of alchemy you want young people to believe in before anyone tells them it isn\u2019t real.\n\nJust as they were putting it away, a car from a paper two counties over pulled up and a woman in a linen jacket with proper shoes stepped out with a notebook like a minority religion. She asked if she could ask three questions and then asked two very good ones and one that made Lark want to laugh. \u201cWhat do you want it to feel like when you leave the ground,\u201d the woman asked June, and June considered the floor as if thinking happened there and then answered, \u201cI want it to feel like the first time you say a word you\u2019ve only ever read.\u201d The woman nodded like she had come for that sentence and got in her car and left, taking it away to put on a page where strangers could read it and feel less alone without knowing why.\n\nThat night, the ducks were neither villains nor symbols, just small green heads under a satin black that had sewn itself over the pond. Lark lay in her bed and listened to the compressor in the fridge do its little complaint, to the far train rehearse its loneliest syllable, to the wind in the maple tell a story in a dialect it had picked up out west and brought home. She thought of the fence and the line and the way permission can be a set of pennants you put up yourself and then have the audacity to clear anyway. She touched the glass dome on the pendant with the skitter of her fingernail and felt the duck decoy heart and the rocket skin steady under it, private and offered at once. She promised herself, without ceremony and without witnesses, that she would keep repositioning her fear toward useful norths and would hold the light until her arms trembled and then hand it carefully to Eli or Irene or the boy with the eyebrows or anyone whose fingers hadn\u2019t yet gotten their chance to ache from holding. In the morning, June would wake up with a solution to a problem that had not introduced itself and would treat it like an expected guest. In the morning, Denise would send a text with a calendar and a joke. In the morning, the town would open its eyes and ask, as all towns do, for something to point at with pride. For now, night took its job back and did not fail them.\n\nThe next week wrote itself future and then asked them to fill it in. Monday brought a man in a suit that fit him like an argument, who wanted to invest in June\u2019s verb because his fund had a hole in the shape of modern hope. He spoke kindly and too fast and watched June\u2019s hands as if her fingers made money by virtue of moving. June gave him water in a mason jar and used words like \u201cno\u201d and \u201clater\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d in a way that made the jar sweat. Lark sat in the doorway and learned the grammar of defense that has no trace of bitterness in it, only line-drawing. Tuesday brought a thirty-minute segment on the local radio with Pax where callers asked if the rocket could be used for charcuterie delivery (no), for emergency hearts (maybe someday), for mail (stop). Wednesday brought an email from the state that had a kind tone and the word \u201cpermit\u201d spelled correctly throughout, which made Irene clap exactly once. Thursday brought nothing but weather and work and the relief of a day no one wanted to write a sentence about later.\n\nOn Friday, they tried ugly-fast on uneven ground because Irene had written the sentence \u201clife is not the driveway\u201d on the board and underlined it like a threat and a wish. They rolled to the park\u2019s edge where the grass made a poor case for itself and the ground undulated as if it had inherited some opinion from the creek. The windsock took up a position like a judge. Sita rigged the new, heavier bracket and tapped it with her wrench like she was listening to a sleeping thing\u2019s chest. Eli marked out a perimeter that seemed too large until the wind bunched itself and decided to make a point. Kids from the elementary school hung on the fence, small faces made of breath and summer and opinions. Irene explained, loudly enough for all of them to pretend not to hear, what a soft abort looks like and what men in old movies got wrong about the difference between daring and flirting with hospitals. June adjusted her stance in a way that made Lark think of a girl at the top of a diving board who taught herself to let her heels kiss the wood hello before she jumped.\n\nThe machine did what it does when it is watched by children. It behaved nearly perfectly and then failed in a small, teachable way. A gust did a mean thing and then pretended innocence. The correction June chose was decent and would have been enough at home. The grass under the right front foot turned out to be damp from a sprinkler that somebody had forgotten to turn off, and damp grass made a liar of friction. The strange beauty of it was how the failure drew every person present into a single body for a beat. Sita\u2019s hand moved. Irene\u2019s voice said, \u201cnow.\u201d June\u2019s jaw set. Eli took a step forward like an offering and then back like a good boy. Lark felt her fear try to stand on the chair, and she told it to sit down. The machine kissed the ground where it should not, and a panel skittered with a sound like someone pushing a baking sheet across tile. A boy whispered \u201ccool,\u201d reverent and bad, and his mother put a hand on his head without looking at him because she had learned gentleness was the leash that made some forms of awe behave.\n\nNothing exploded. Nothing smoldered. The bracket did not embarrass itself. The failure was the kind you can hold in your hands and assign homework to. June crouched, forehead briefly to the machine\u2019s side as if listening for a heartbeat, then looked up and said, \u201cI owe you all a better philosophy of grass,\u201d and the kids inched closer because she had said the kind of sentence that turns into a pull quote on posters in rooms where adults hope children will feel something they are not yet cynical about.\n\nThat evening, the pond had a kind of light on it that made everyone speak in sentences that included the words \u201cremember\u201d and \u201calways\u201d and were not entirely accurate but nobody cared. A pair of geese did a sloppy parade with babies who were impossible to hate, and a turtle made a case for the superiority of turtles by doing nothing and still being applauded by a toddler. Lark and June walked the path slow, not because of fear but because speed had become a tool, something not to be spent casually. Behind them, the town tried on a future where the library lawn had a sculpture that could, at certain times, be a door. In front of them, a boy on a bike practiced riding no-hands and then caught himself with a laugh that suggested he\u2019d decided the ground was a friend. Above them, a big lazy V of birds made a letter across the early dark. Lark looked up and thought, with a sudden consistent joy, that she might finally do what she\u2019d promised herself on a night near sleep\u2014that she might learn the names, not to own them but to hold the going in her mouth, to taste the truth of it. She would start with Vega and Altair, teach herself that the Swan was a story and not a dare, steel herself against the unfortunate name of the star in the tail that she would refuse to say in front of Tamara without a warning. She would join Irene under a certain winter sky and be taught what edges mean at different times of year. She would hold the light, and when her arms tired, she would say so. She would stop when stop was holy, and she would go when go was a verb that made all the right noise.\n\nThe next morning would be letters with agreements and a grocery run where a stranger would buy her strawberries because her niece had squealed when the rocket cleared the line and that squeal had reached his old heart and done a neat repair. It would be a phone call with Denise about a shoot in a field that would be actually a field with ticks and they would say no to the ticks and yes to the field on a different day. It would be Jo from the salon putting a note on her mirror that said NO DIFFUSERS ON LAUNCH DAYS because the noise spooked the ancient dog under the desk. It would be Tamara glazing something with stars and pretending it was an accident. It would be the high fence taken down and the marks on the driveway beginning to look like a map you could learn, not to travel exactly, but to point at when someone younger asked you how to get there.\n\nThey would go to the state and get a sternness and a permission. They would make a thing that rose, then stayed, then came down. They would set plates and wash them. They would read the notes from the internet and not die. They would walk to the pond and see what it offered. They would not invite miracles and they would accept them anyway, in the form of bolts that chose to stay home and wind that chose to be polite and ducks that chose that day to be more rock than bird. They would remember how to be a person in a room while a machine warms the air. They would be sisters in the first and truest sense: two people who throw their attention toward the same corner every morning and find a way, with hands and vowels, to keep it steady.",

The crew came in a white van that smelled faintly of yogurt and ambition, and they carried cases that made the neighbors look up the way they used to when someone rolled a piano into a parlor. Denise had written a little manifesto the week before\u2014three pages, short paragraphs, no exclamation points\u2014and the producer read it like a person learning the rules to a game he did not believe would be fun. The red light Pax had mounted near the garage door glowed until Irene nodded twice, and when it clicked off the room felt taller, as if permission added headroom. \u201cWe keep the wires out of the pond,\u201d June said by way of welcome, and the sound guy did a small defensive shrug like he had interfered with water before and had learned nothing useful.\n\nLark knew how to do this part so well it made her teeth ache. She stood where they asked and then stood where she asked and kept her voice in the register that turns strangers into participants. The camera wanted her face to break at certain times, and she disappointed it by breaking her face at others. The producer tried to write a scene in which a duck, adorable and problematic, would glide through the frame at the exact moment June used the word thrust, and Irene intercepted the outline with a smile that had the weight of road salt. \u201cWe don\u2019t bait wildlife,\u201d she said without raising anything but the temperature of the silence, and the producer made a little motion with his hand as if swatting a thought. They filmed anyway, without the duck, and it turned out to be a better scene: June naming bolts like saints, Sita laughing with her whole collarbone, Pax demonstrating with two donuts how yaw can pretend to be your friend.\n\nThe week organized itself around a bright circle on the calendar called HOP 6 in Irene\u2019s careful print. It would be the first one with a temporary flight restriction over Westfield, a phrase that made old men at the diner sit up straighter and count planes out the window just to feel useful. Irene handled the paperwork like a person carrying a cake through a kitchen where children have been invited to participate; she kept one elbow high and the other low and never moved faster than a brisk kindness. The mayor learned how to say NOTAM without turning it into a joke, which is harder than it sounds. Pax ran comms to the hobby airport fifteen miles away where men in foam-capped hangars called their wives to say, \u201cYou will not believe what America is doing in a cul-de-sac.\u201d\n\nJune finished Block B with a tenderness that scared her a little. The heavier bracket had been given a ceremony consisting of a torque wrench, two witnesses, and a joke about dowries. She had added three sensors that would tell her what the belly felt when ugliness visited and had run wires so clean and labeled so politely that Irene took a photograph for her secret album of competence. There was a new vent that June described as \u201ca door for hot spirits,\u201d which made the librarian blush and the high schoolers draw ghosts on the chalkboard. Sita found a hairline crack in a fitting and refused to let it be a metaphor; she replaced it, put the cracked one on a shelf like a lesson, and told June that they were not building an altar.\n\nLark\u2019s film answered the festival question with a yes that had garnish. The program would premiere at dusk under an awning made of college money in a town that thought it had invented independent thought, and the director texted a photo of paper lanterns like captured moons. Denise already had a dress delivered, something that understood shoulders, and a little case of pins for hair that would make her look like she had been blessed by a careful wind. The problem was not the dress; the problem was that HOP 6 had the same hunger for that dusk. June said she could move the hop an hour earlier and Lark said she could drive fast and Mara said she could hold the monologue until the last possible breath, and Irene said, in the way of a woman who has been assigned to save people from themselves, \u201cPick the one you will not resent.\u201d Lark told the dress to wait, told the pins to forgive her, and told the lanterns she would visit them in a different life.\n\nThe day before HOP 6, Tamara\u2019s angry vase cracked with a sound that had been promised to clay and not to the people in the kitchen. She had set it near the sink because even artists forget themselves, and the faucet did that overreach it had been doing for a month, the one that Lark\u2019s father kept promising to fix. The crack was thin and clever and, as Tamara held the vase in both hands and breathed out slow, it traveled like an idea that wants to be caught saying it deserves to exist. \u201cIt was always going to do that,\u201d she said, not angry at all now, and put her thumb along the new line as if it were a seam in a dress she meant to be taken in. \u201cI can make it purposeful if I want. I can fill the fault with gold and then charge sad strangers for feeling seen.\u201d June kissed the ridge of her knuckle in an absent-minded way and then made a note in her head about pressure and the way you cannot ask water, fire, or attention to be less themselves.\n\nHer father wandered that night, not far and not dangerously, but he opened the back door and went out without his shoes and walked until the grass asked his soft feet to consider memory as a different country. Lark found him by the lemon tree, standing with his hands open as if rain had been promised. He wore the towel over his shoulder and had a spoon in his hand for no reason the world could discern. She got him back inside by asking him if the bees would like to sleep in the kitchen tonight, which he thought was funny in a way that rearranged him into the man he had been last year, and they stood for a minute with their foreheads leaned against the cool of the refrigerator. He said, \u201cYou were a good baby. You slept with your fists like you were guarding jokes,\u201d and she didn\u2019t tell him she had never slept that way because she didn\u2019t want to lose the picture he had drawn.\n\nHOP 6 morning was one of those midwestern compromises: the air promised civility and the wind promised nothing beyond appearing occasionally and keeping things from becoming too easy. Irene had real firefighters on hand this time, not because she didn\u2019t trust Pax\u2019s hoses or Ron\u2019s beagle to sense hubris, but because she believed in telling luck she\u2019d done what she could. The TFR went live five minutes before they rolled the machine out of the garage, and somewhere a man in a small plane peered at his panel and felt important for obeying a rule you could explain to a twelve-year-old. The docuseries crew, chastened by the red light\u2019s earlier theology, kept their distance and filmed feet and hands and the back of Irene\u2019s head because something in them had learned, briefly, how to love the edges of action.\n\nA surprise presented itself in the sensible way surprises do around towns with ponds. Migration had ignored the calendar by a day. A line of geese like a lazy necklace had draped itself along the far end of the cul-de-sac, heads down in a way that meant both food and disinterest. They were not on the field of play; they were not even interested in the cones; they simply existed at the exact intersection of intention and liability. Irene pulled her lower lip into her mouth and chewed a principle. Pax muttered to the windsock as if it could endorse a delay. June looked at the line of gray and green and made her face do nothing. Lark walked to the mayor\u2019s office in her rib cage and convened something that did not involve votes or donuts.\n\nThey postponed and the town absorbed it like a harmless winter. Boys on bikes made loops with extra gravity so their feelings would not fly out. The mayor apologized to a retired man who needed to be apologized to in order to tell a good story later, and he nodded and was gracious both in the telling and the being. The salon owner showed up with peas in a bag that had once been full of Sinatra records and handed them out like communion. Mothers showed their sons how to toss them not like stones but like small gifts; fathers, grudging and tender, followed suit. The geese accepted and shuffled and then, resigned to the rude generosity of it, chose another corner of their day. Ron stood with his hands in his pockets and made himself not say what he could have said about birds and men and respect.\n\nThe hop itself carried a new kind of quiet. The town had already spent its first sigh; no one wanted to give the second away. June cycled through checklists in a tone she used for bedtime stories when her goddaughter visited, and Sita\u2019s finger floated like a promise she wanted to keep. The machine rose, and for once it did so without ceremony\u2014a sensible lever drawn, a reasonable answer returned. It cleared the invisible fence Irene had drawn with geometry and pencils, and held. Under the belly, air remembered how to agree with itself faster. The yaw twitch came, then passed, and June didn\u2019t let her pride reach for it like a bad snack.\n\nHalfway through, failure entered its name on the register with a polite cough. A minor oscillation on a vector June had believed she had charmed made the right-paneled world flicker. Sita said \u201cnow\u201d in a voice that held both fear and habit, and June flicked the ugly-fast she had trained for without letting it become a sermon. The vent did what a door does for breath when a room is crowded. Heat that would have pretended anger simply left and made new friends upward. The machine settled with a certainty it had not yet owned, and the pennants that had been rolled and hidden in a bin rustled as if remembering old work.\n\nThere was a small fire, because complexities insist on finishing their thought. It happened two feet to the left of any human foot and on a scrap of grass already resigned to its own existence. Pax was halfway there before Irene would have had to say a thing, and the hiss of foam made everyone think of holidays in other countries. A child said \u201ccool\u201d again in the precise tone of a person in training for awe, and his mother chose to let him be right without telling him what could have been. June sat on the ground the way you sit when you intend for the ground to forgive you, not because you did anything unforgivable, but because you believe in good relations.\n\nApplause happened, but it wasn\u2019t loud. It moved through the group like a hand over a blanket, smoothing. People nodded as if they had come to the end of a particularly satisfying sentence and were afraid to ruin the cadence with what came next. The docuseries camera caught two seconds of true happiness on June\u2019s mouth and then lost it because true happiness isn\u2019t trained to hit its mark. Lark went to her, not to lift her up or to be lifted, but to be at the exact place where relief looks out over the next field. They didn\u2019t say anything good enough for quotable, which is what made it perfect.\n\nThe email from the festival sat like an egg until dusk, and then it cracked in Lark\u2019s pocket. Mara sent a picture of a paper lantern that did not need her face; it needed strangers and it had found them. Denise texted a photo of the dress hanging from the top of a door and said, \u201cI know, don\u2019t worry, we will give it a different night,\u201d and for once she meant it without experienced sarcasm. Lark stood on the scorch mark and let the pendant learn her heartbeat again. The green sliver under glass caught the last yellow in the trees and became briefly the kind of hope you can carry without resenting its weight.\n\nThat night the house tasted like oranges and hose water and the power of not being filmed. Tamara taped the crack in the vase in an X not because it would help but because human hands like to do something visible when they are agreeing in private. Irene opened her laptop and wrote a letter to a person at a desk with a title, and the sentences arranged themselves in the tone of a favor owed and a favor paid. Sita fell asleep on the couch like a soldier in peacetime, and Eli wrote \u201cugly-fast\u201d in the margins of his math worksheet and knew, because he had been given permission by adults who know better, that he would get away with it.\n\nTrouble came in a smaller costume the next morning and knocked, polite and irritating. The docuseries producer wanted a pickup shot in which Lark looked at the pond from a distance and thought something, anything, that would cut well with a voice-over he had already recorded about fear being a horizon. Denise had not protected against pickup shots because you cannot protect against everything, and Irene was at the county offices trying to keep a form from learning to duplicate itself in a drawer. June said she could be the one to look and think, and the producer laughed in that way that tries to make insult a social event. Lark told him no so quickly and so kindly that he forgot what he had been about to say about sunlight.\n\nShe went to the pond anyway, as one goes to see a person after telling someone else they do not get to see that person. Westfield gave her the usuals: a jogger with a backpack full of reasons, a woman practicing tai chi with the sort of sincerity that erases embarrassment from the air, a fathers-and-strollers alliance that made everyone\u2019s genes feel seen. She stood by the sign about bread and watched a line of mallards write a sentence on the water no one could translate. The fear touched her shoulder and then did that thing where it went to sit down without drama, and she reached up and touched the glass dome the way a person touches a proof they don\u2019t need to show anyone else to believe.\n\nOn the way back, she saw Ron in his driveway teaching his beagle to sit on command and the beagle teaching him what command meant under certain philosophies. He waved her over without the clipboard like a man who had taken a chance on someone else\u2019s verbs and found it tasted better than he had expected. He showed her his wheel well where the dent from wind school now had a scar like a smile that had decided to stick around. He said, \u201cI told my nephew this week he doesn\u2019t get to call himself a man just because he has opinions and access to a truck. He has to build something or keep quiet while somebody else does. He will probably go on the internet and call me names. I will tell him to come over and I\u2019ll feed him pie.\u201d Lark told him she believed in his plan like it was physics.\n\nThe hearing at the state capitol came and went with fewer theatrics than the town had expected and more difficulty than June had hoped. The panel wanted to know about birds again because birds are a convenient method for people to name their vague wholesomeness. Irene brought charts and a photograph of the windsock looking saintly and explained that the birds were not the stakeholders the state imagined them to be, at least in this case, in this place, at these times, with these protections. June spoke about flame trenches as if she were discussing manners at a table set for cousins, and a man with a chin tried to trap her in a sentence about ambition and she changed the tense on him before he could finish. Lark watched a woman in the second row whose job title did not fit on the placard, and when that woman leaned forward, Lark leaned forward, and the signal went back and forth between two people who had no intention of being photographed that day.\n\nThey returned to banners on Main Street not for them but for a chili cook-off that had been scheduled for the same Saturday because towns are always doing too much in the same place and pretending they meant to. Pax entered with a recipe called Throttle and the mayor\u2019s husband burned his onions and swore in the church parking lot. Denise came wearing sneakers and no makeup and bought three jars of jam from a woman who had never been to Los Angeles and had decided she did not like it anyway. Tamara\u2019s studio opened its door, and she hung the cracked vase with gold like a confession on the north wall where the light made it less about an apology and more about a map.\n\nThat evening there was a meteor shower that had not consulted Westfield before scheduling itself. Irene dragged a telescope from her trunk like a magician learning to carry her own hat, and she showed the kids Vega and Deneb and the long arm of the Andromeda as if she were introducing them to cousins who would always pick them up at the airport. Lark lay on the driveway with a cushion and a blanket that had once been an animal and learned to pick out the Swan and refuse, privately, to call its tail by the name she disliked. June lay beside her without speaking because sometimes gratitude ruins itself when narrated. A meteor scratched a brilliant mistake across the roof of their night and nobody made a wish because wishes are lazy and they\u2019d done the paperwork.\n\nSometime after midnight, after the last teenager had been persuaded by an aunt to go home and the last jar of chili pride had been absorbed back into the body of Westfield, an email came in from a woman who signed nothing and owned nothing but her voice. She wrote that she had watched the segment on television with an old cat in her lap, and that she had changed the lightbulb on her porch last week while crying, and that she had been waiting to read a story in which a woman chose to stay in a town instead of leaving it for a prize and did not get punished by fate or patriarchy. She wrote that ducks are stupid and sweet and that she used to count sparrows between the minutes of her husband\u2019s breathing. She ended by saying, \u201cI have been taught that fear is a kind of rudeness I should correct with better manners, and it is such a relief to be told it is a coordinate.\u201d Lark closed her eyes after she read it, not to sleep, but because sometimes the body wants to agree in darkness.\n\nThe next morning the rocket wanted something small and obnoxious and refused to be elegant about asking. June scowled at a junction that had once behaved and decided to misbehave, and she tapped it with a wrench that had known her hand long enough to be a friend. Sita handed her a different size of the same and then a different material entirely because this is how love behaves among people who build things: you keep offering alternatives until the stubbornness finds itself alone. Irene made tea and pretended to discuss air speed with Pax while listening for a sound only she can hear, the sound a day makes when it is deciding whether to be the kind that lends itself to a chapter or to a grocery list.\n\nThey did not lift that day because not lifting is a skill that needs exercise. Instead, June and Lark and Tamara and the father and Irene and Pax and Sita and Eli and the beagle went down to the pond for twenty minutes without changing their clothes to town clothes. They fed peas like they were paying a tithe to the gods of unremarkable comfort. The ducks came and pretended to deserve it and did not look at anyone particularly. A boy in a superhero t-shirt leaned against a railing too much and learned, gently, the difference between almost and sooner. Lark heard a train and said the syllable out loud because it has become a family joke that the train owes them rent, and June laughed and leaned her head on Lark\u2019s shoulder in the kind of way that means the day is going to be fine.\n\nIn the afternoon, Westfield\u2019s high school had a power outage and the principal texted to ask if the library could host two classes with good behavior and one with a track record like weather. The librarian said yes because that is the librarian\u2019s religion, and Lark came to read out loud because it turns out fame is just a permission slip that lets you do the work you wanted to do when you were nine. She read them the story about the bus and the word OUT OF SERVICE and did not tell them it was her because sometimes the room is better off thinking it\u2019s about anybody. When she finished, a boy asked if the rocket would go to Mars and June, who had come to fix a chair in the reading corner, said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to Westfield,\u201d and the boy made a face and then, after a second, did not.\n\nBy sunset, the docuseries producer had learned to bring seltzer and to sit on the steps and to keep his phrases in his mouth until they had matured. He asked June if he could mic the machine and June said yes in a way that made it clear microphones were not to be glued, dangled, or treated like solutions. He asked Lark if she\u2019d say the sentence again about fear and seatbelts, and she said she would not because truth refuses repetition on certain days. He asked Irene for a quote about liability and she told him about a boy she\u2019d known who learned to use his hands without hurting people, and he looked disappointed at the lack of an acronym. They filmed the beagle yawning and forgot to roll on the moment the windsock nodded like a friend you will lose.\n\nHOP 7 landed on a Monday because fate likes to remind you you are mortal in the least poetic parts of the week. The wind was nothing, a rumor. The geese had moved. The paperwork smelled faintly of ink and triumph. June tied her hair back in the blunt braids that make engines feel calm. Sita checked the bracket, kissed her teeth, and pretended to threaten it with a hammer. Irene ran a fingertip along a seam that had once worried her and was now just part of the family. Lark stood at the edge with her mouth full of a speech she planned not to need.\n\nIt rose. It hovered. It sloped its shoulder toward a joke and then took the joke back. It bought the town one more story it could tell with the word \u201cwe.\u201d The beagle did not bark; the boy did. The windsock made a convincing case for dignity. The machine came down, and June laughed from somewhere in her lungs that no one had touched since she was a teenager falling asleep on a trampoline under satellites we used to think were stars. The crew caught the laugh because luck owed them one. The town let itself clap with both hands and no pockets.\n\nAfterward, when everyone was full of relief and committed to chili, June pulled Lark aside with a look that belonged to eleven-year-old June with a paper airplane that had gone too far and not far enough. \u201cNext month Irene says we can try a long pause at top of arc, not long-long, but time enough for a person to know they have become a person with a different view,\u201d she said, voice steady like a danger line written in chalk. \u201cI am not asking you to come because of cameras or because the town needs to see your mouth behaving. I am asking you to come because I want you there when I teach my body a new yes.\u201d Lark did not answer with a speech because a speech would only steal the electricity from the wire. She said, \u201cI will hold the light,\u201d and the little green sliver under glass seemed to thank them both for remembering what kind of story they had chosen.",
