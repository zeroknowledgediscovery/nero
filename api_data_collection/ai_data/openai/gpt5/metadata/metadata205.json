     "novel_text": "The sea around Helsinki talks louder in April, when the ice lets go and the gulls remember how to swear. I liked to sit on the lip of a drainpipe above a courtyard on Meritullinkatu and listen to all of it: trams singing their electric hymns, a flurry of Finnish popping up from the street like the sound of river stones, the slap of fish in the market. From that perch the city was a series of shining edges and tunnels. I could leap from gutter to gutter in three strides. If the wind was right, I could open my wings (thin as onion skin, light as milk foam, alright they rustled like page corners) and glide down to the tiles of the low roof next door.\n\nSisu would be waiting on the roof, whiskers forward, nose bright. He\u2019d gnaw a piece of rye crust with the seriousness of a professor and look up at me with that almost-smile you get when you\u2019re not an animal at all, but a friend who listens.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d he\u2019d say around the crumb. He said \u201cwell\u201d like a drum tapped once with a thumb. \u201cWhat did the wind tell you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat the ferries are sharpening their anchors and the market lady in the yellow cap is going to drop a whole basket of blueberries on the stone tomorrow,\u201d I told him that day. \u201cAnd that there\u2019s a storm coming that smells like new plastic.\u201d\n\nSisu\u2019s whiskers drooped at the word. Plastic. The gulls loved it, the humans loved it. It flapped. It shone. It filled the world like a shadow you could carry around. For us, it hissed. It strangled. The wind got caught in it and forgot its own name.\n\n\u201cHer?\u201d Sisu asked, ears flicking toward the harbor.\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d I pushed a pebble with my toe and felt the small engine of the city humming underneath. \u201cSaid she\u2019s building something, something with handles.\u201d\n\nSisu chewed, thinking. He had a little scar near his right eye from when we got too close to a cormorant and his second thought came too late. \u201cAava,\u201d he said, and there was a tiny scrape of tooth on crust that meant he was saying more than the name. \u201cKassinen. Bag-witch. Bag-queen. Bag\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cToo many bags,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAlways too many. Her house must sound like a thunderstorm, every hour of the day.\u201d\n\nIt was one thing for a human to carry a bag. Two, three even. Sometimes they needed it. But Aava Kassinen made a cult of plastic. She tamed the city\u2019s winds and made them pull her white, blue, yellow trophies into sails, into flags, into a thousand crackling kites so even the swans thought twice before flying past the Katajanokka jetty. Everyone knew of her. No one saw her unless they\u2019d already been wrapped and wriggling and lifted in the pale embrace of polyethylene.\n\nWe had seen the bottom of those bags, Sisu and I. We had felt the way light gets wrong inside the bag. The suffocation of sound. We knew there were stories of pixies who had floated off in those makeshift hot-air nothings and been found hanging from pines on Seurasaari, drained of their names. Aava Kassinen left a wake of them. Not dead. Just\u2014creased. Folded into another shape.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go have a look,\u201d I said. \u201cWhile the old caretaker naps.\u201d\n\nSisu finished the crust, wiped his paws like a strict aunt, and nodded. He wore his bravery under his fur like a ribbon he would never take off. I picked up my coil of thread, the coin that served as my mirror, the half-blue feather I had found under the tram stop sign. I tucked my wings closer (they\u2019d been stinging lately, a kind of pins-and-needles ache that made me itch to fold them under my shirt, made me itch in ways I didn\u2019t like to think about). We went down the drainpipe, a long slide past rust and the marks of a dozen winters, past old snow nestling in the elbows of elbows of the pipe, then out through the grill at the base and into the world.\n\nThe world smelled like coffee and herring and the particular metal of springtime. We crossed the courtyard under the bicycles asleep with their front wheels turned in upon themselves, slid through a crack below the wooden gate, and emerged into sunlight sharp enough to file teeth on. People walked past with their complicated boots, their dogs on twisty leads. A tram sighed and glided by, green as a pond. A boy above us dropped a stick that could have been a flagpole to me. I ducked and laughed.\n\n\u201cUnder-Espa?\u201d Sisu asked. \u201cThrough the tulips?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Then past the bandstand and down to the ferry pier. We\u2019ll catch the scent there.\u201d\n\nUnder-Espa was the underworld I knew best. People strolled with ice creams on the bright benches, and we moved below the lip of the path, slipping between tulip stems and trash bins, under the low bridge of a stroller and past three girls who sat on the grass and laughed. The grass hissed secrets. The pigeons, those grumpy sons of stone, walked like policemen and watched us with one eye, then the other. A paper bag blew past us, trying to look innocent, and Sisu spat at it.\n\nAt the bandstand, a busker with a red scarf drew a song out of a violin that made seagulls pause mid-curse. I stopped, wings pricking. There are notes that catch in the ribs like fishhooks and you have to let them do what they do, tug you a little. I hovered in the shade, watching the bow leap, the elbow rise and fall. Sisu waited a heartbeat, two, then tugged my trouser leg. He is patient with my love for big sounds. He has had to be.\n\nWe passed the statue of J. L. Runeberg looking at something only he could see, and then the air changed. The harbor announced itself with wet light and old rope. We came down to the edge of Kauppatori and the tents in their neat lines\u2014orange, white\u2014masted in a wind that tasted like fish scales and copper coins. A woman laughed and a clapper found a glass. The vendor with eyes like two coal buttons shouted \u201cPerunaa!\u201d\u2014potatoes\u2014and slapped the counter with his palm. The gulls called out their regular blasphemies.\n\nThere. That hiss. It wasn\u2019t the gulls. A scudding, skittering snare-drum noise of thin plastic rubbing thin plastic, of handles tying themselves into knots and untie and tie again. The bags were alive. Sometimes in a city like this everything is a little alive; a bench can get bored, a door can sulk. The bags didn\u2019t feel like that. They felt like they were rehearsing someone else\u2019s breath.\n\nSisu smelled it too. The fur on his back lifted in a little tide. He craned his head toward the ferry pier.\n\nWe waited until three schoolchildren passed, knapsacks thumping their backs, a herd of busy calves, then slid in the wake of a dolly stacked with crates of pickled herring and jumped aboard the ferry just as the ramp shrieked and hauled up. The humans filed onto benches and rubbed their hands. I found a corner behind a life ring where the wind made a small steady hand that stroked my hair. Sisu tucked himself under my arm and peered out like a ticket inspector.\n\nThe city softened. The ferry made that smooth, persistent noise, half a purr and half a yawn, and the buildings along the shore\u2014pale yellow, white, rust\u2014sorted themselves out like guests at a Christmas party. We slid past the mounds of ice that had not got the memo, past a swan who held his own reflection like a secret. I watched the sea. I watched everything. Sisu counted pylons. I counted gulls with one wing patch darker than the rest.\n\nWhen we were halfway to Suomenlinna, it hit us. The air changed in a way I feel first in my gums and the long bones of my fingers. Cold was in it but also friction, like a small, constant rubbing, the distant sigh of something about to stick and hold. There\u2019s a skin you can throw over a place, if you are the type of person to do that, a skin that looks transparent but forces everything underneath to breathe wrong. We were inside some kind of dome.\n\nSisu pressed his whiskers against his forepaws and spoke into them like a microphone. \u201cIivari,\u201d he said (only Sisu calls me by my full name except when it\u2019s formal, except when the whole of Under-Espa calls me Little Iiv, but Sisu calls me Iivari, which means he is scolding me), \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t. We should ride on to the island and then come back again and go eat that piece of pulla the baker dropped and I hid under the bench by the tram stop and then nap. We should definitely nap.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t always,\u201d I said. \u201cBut sometimes we should. This might be sometimes.\u201d\n\nHe went still. Sisu has a stillness like a cat about to do something illegal. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the first sign of\u2014of suffocation\u2014I bite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s plastic you can\u2019t bite your way out of it,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll use the pin instead.\u201d\n\nI showed him the pin, silver, handsome, salvaged from the wide world and loved into my pocket. It had saved us before. It was not a hero\u2019s sword, but then I have never been the sword type. Pins, threads, buttons, coins\u2014that was my kind of hoard.\n\nWe came up under the rail as the ferry took the last curve. The island rose green and military. The old ramps, the stone walls, the roofs that have seen everything, even Sweden looking coldly down its nose. The ferry nosed up and kissed the dock. The ramp rattled down. The dome of plastic breath got tighter.\n\nWe disembarked with the baskets and the children and the two grandmothers arguing about nothing in particular. We slid into the shadows, down the small ditch where the island keeps its grudges, and waited for a dog with a yellow bandanna to be distracted by a smell. Then we moved toward the dry dock, toward the sound.\n\nIt was a whole chorus by then. Even Sisu, who can ignore almost anything if there is pastry involved, set his shoulders. The plastic whispered around us. It had the crinkle-purr of a candy wrapper just about to announce itself, the stick-slap of tape, the hush. We came to the mouth of the dry dock and looked down.\n\nAava Kassinen did not make a house; she made a nest in the way some people wear their secrets as clothing. The nest was extruded from a hundred, a thousand bags: corner store white, bold department store red, the pale translucent blue that is not a color so much as a memory of sky. She had fastened them by their handles into chains and those chains into ropes, and those ropes into cables that fanned out in a kind of horrible canopy that made the air more like a bag than air. The canopy went high, almost to the lip of the dock, and under it the bags made tents, tunnels, satin-veils. The whole thing breathed. It rose and fell, so slowly you would think you imagined it, like someone dreaming.\n\nShe moved inside it like a weather event. You looked and thought she was a plastic bag herself, then you saw the angles: the sharpness of cheekbones; the glossy hair that wasn\u2019t hair but strips braided from the plastic itself; the hands that were bare, red with the cold, nimble beyond comfort. Aava had made herself a garment of handles. They flapped and teased the wind, and they made a sound like applause when she raised her arms.\n\n\u201cWhy so many?\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhy so many when one will do?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the bags,\u201d Sisu said. \u201cIt\u2019s the noise. She has a whole orchestra and it only plays one song. She must sleep better inside it.\u201d\n\nEveryone thinks the villains sleep badly. I am not so sure. If your badness irons everything flat for you\u2014if you know how to fold away doubt\u2014you might sleep like a rock.\n\nWe slipped along the lip of the dock, alert as thread pulled tight. The plastic hissed above and below. There were other pixies here, I saw. Not many, because who would stay, but a few in gleams of blue and green, names folded under their tongues. They were helping her knot a rope that could pull the wind itself. Their faces were street-stone pale. They had a tiredness like scuff marks. When they looked up you could see the plastic in their pupils, that glint, the way the world got slicker. It is hard to resist slickness. I have failed to resist less.\n\nSisu\u2019s paw on my sleeve. He gestured with his chin. She had company.\n\nOn a low crate near the center of the nest sat a boy, nine or ten, his shoes muddy and his hair doing that summer cowlick thing despite it being spring. He held a paper cup he didn\u2019t drink from. He watched Aava knot. He didn\u2019t look scared. He looked like someone who found the perfect hiding place and is thinking, this will be my place now. Aava spoke to him without looking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a ship,\u201d she said. \u201cMy first was a kite. Then a sail. This is almost a ship. See. Feel it. The wind doesn\u2019t fight me. It gives. The wind wants it. The wind is nothing but an old friend who forgot its own face. It does not want to choose a direction. It wants to be carried.\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded because she was beautiful, and her voice could make the chips on a white plate sit up and listen, and he was a boy with spring in his soles and he had met somebody who said the word friend when meaning the wind. If she had asked him to fetch five hundred more bags, he would have run all the way back to the city with a grin and not felt the ache.\n\nI swallowed. \u201cShe\u2019s making a ship,\u201d I said. \u201cAn airship. She\u2019s going to climb the air like a staircase.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been doing it for years,\u201d Sisu said. \u201cWhy do you think the gulls look so tired? Why do you think the night has that squeak under it, like a cupboard that needs oiling? Why do you think you keep waking with your tongue stuck to the roof of your mouth, little Iiv? There\u2019s plastic in the air the way there\u2019s salt on the rocks. Of course it makes ships. You can make anything if you don\u2019t care who breathes it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me little,\u201d I said on reflex. I am not as tall as the tallest dandelion, but that is not the point. \u201cWe have to do something.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. He had wrapped his tail around my wrist without either of us noticing. It was a habit he had when the ground started to feel untrustworthy. \u201cWe can cut the knots,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe can saw the ropes. The wind will do the rest for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the pin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have teeth.\u201d\n\nHe grinned and I did too. We slid down a rusted chain, dropped into the shadow that pooled under an overhanging bit of stone, patterned with lichens like tiny continents. The air inside the nest had a high tone, like glass singing if you lick your finger and circle it. The tone made my elbows feel hollow. The bags brushed our ears. Everywhere you moved, a ghost of sound. It was like being inside breath itself.\n\nWe got to work. When you are small, attentions are your weapons. We found the second rope, not the first. You never cut the first; you always cut the second and the fourth and the ninth. We found the places where the handles had stretched thin and made a careful hole, then another, then we teased at the knot until the knot forgot what it was and became string again. That rope laughed itself loose across our shoulders and we lay under the laugh and tried not to. We moved to the next.\n\nSisu would do this thing with his paws when he concentrated, turning his wrists the smallest amount, as if he were tightening screws. He had this soft steady patience that made the world come right around him. He could chew through the tooth of a comb in five minutes, but he would not, because I had said I liked that comb. That\u2019s the kind of friend he is. I matched my breath to his (sloppy, my breath, more like a fountain than a metronome, but I try). We worked as if the city had been made for us to fix.\n\n\u201cYou know what they call her?\u201d I whispered as we moved. \u201cIn the old tunnels? Muovi-morsian. Plastic bride. Bride of the wind.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is married to her own noise,\u201d Sisu said. \u201cDon\u2019t give her the wind. The wind is too old for her. The wind has seen more lovers than we have words for snow.\u201d\n\nWe cut the third rope. We were reaching for the fourth when the boy laughed.\n\n\u201cYou have a tail,\u201d he said.\n\nWe froze.\n\nHe was looking right at us, but not exactly, the way a human looks at you when you are almost small enough to belong to another world. His smile was neat, sly, an echo of someone else\u2019s grin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thread,\u201d Aava said, not looking up from her knot. \u201cEverything has a tail today. Everything trails. Don\u2019t you see? That\u2019s the point.\u201d But there was a new edge to her song.\n\nThe boy pointed. I felt Sisu stiffen. I could smell the sweetness of his fear, the way you smell apple cores in the trash. If the boy reached, and Aava followed his finger, and she looked with the eyes she had for prey\u2014\n\nI did not think. I ran. I ran the way a leaf runs on the surface of water when a fish kisses it from below. We flattened ourselves beneath the mutual breaths of a thousand bags. We took the hidings that the ropes offered. We became shadow where shadow had finished. I put my palm on Sisu\u2019s skull and felt how thin bone is, felt the hum of his small, furious life. I said a word I knew. It was a sort of word you learn under benches, not the kind they put in poems.\n\nAava stopped tying knots.\n\n\u201cBirds get caught in here sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cButterflies. Once a bat. Do you know what you do when a bat panics? You sing. It will catch onto your voice like a climber catches a rope.\u201d Her voice rose and fell like the sea when it\u2019s thinking of a tantrum. \u201cCome out then. Come out. We are not cruel. We are\u2014especially to little ones\u2014merciful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIivari,\u201d Sisu whispered. \u201cShe has the kind of mercy that looks like a bag with a smile printed on it.\u201d\n\nI made a face that meant I agreed and that we needed to move. To the left, then. To the sag at the seam where the big blue bag from the grocery store met the thin sheer ghost of the pharmacy bag, where the knot had been tied by a distracted hand. If we could get there, we could slip out and under the plank and then\u2014\n\nA hand dropped, sudden as a trap door. It was not Aava\u2019s. It was the boy\u2019s. Quick. Curious. Not as strong as it thought it was.\n\nIt closed around my middle.\n\nI am not made for squeezing. My insides are correct only when they feel a certain completeness of space, a certain arrangement\u2014you could call it a nest. That hand stole all the air from me and then gave it back in a way that made each rib count itself, embarrassed to be so few. My eyes watered. My wings writhed against his palm and found nothing to push with. For a breath, two, the world went vertical and the bags around me were big as sails and kissed with a hundred prints of long-dead store names. Sisu\u2019s nose\u2014Sisu\u2019s whole self\u2014disappeared behind a sheet of transparent nothing.\n\n\u201cGot one,\u201d the boy said. Gleeful. \u201cIt\u2019s all bones.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all not yours,\u201d Aava said, but she didn\u2019t say it with much sadness. She said it like there was a point coming and I was the point. She rose, all the handles-hours of her dress rising too, and came toward us. Her eyes were gray like the sea thinks it is when it has no imagination. Her mouth made a small appreciative O when she saw me.\n\n\u201cWell, little,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIivari,\u201d I said because names matter and because I had breath again. \u201cFrom\u2014Helsinki. From here. From there.\u201d\n\nShe made a pleased sound, a coin on a plate. \u201cA town pixie,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought they were finished. But they never are. Nothing is ever finished in a city. It is only covered.\u201d\n\nSisu had become an outline under the plastic, a scribble with ears. He pushed and pushed, and the plastic bent and did not break. He bit, and the plastic tasted like water and refusal.\n\nI looked at the boy. He had something in his face I wanted to like. A softness that sat in the wrong place, maybe. He looked like he sneaked out of school to draw pictures of boats because he knew the math of sails without knowing he knew it. He would have been mine, once, if I had caught him first. He would have followed me to the roof and listened to the wind and asked what it said in the mornings before the city woke up. I said to him, \u201cI bite.\u201d\n\nHe grinned, startled and delighted, and loosened his hand to see if it was true.\n\nI bit. It is not noble. It is what you do when someone puts their life around yours and squeezes.\n\nHe yelped. Aava laughed, brief and bright. I was already falling. The plastic met me like a hug you want; then it turned. It slipped. The nest had its habits and one of them was to catch anything that fell. I slid between brands. I slid across borders. I slid into a tunnel whose walls smelled like bread, medicine, cigarettes, fish, factory, rain. Sisu was at the bottom, paws stretched, eyes wider than winter.\n\n\u201cAre you bleeding?\u201d he asked. It came out thin because the plastic ate half of the word.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cNo. Not in the way that counts. Run.\u201d\n\nWe ran. The tunnel was a throat that led to a mouth in the wood of the dock, the place where the plank did not quite meet the post. The light beyond it was honest. The light did not taste like a factory. We clawed toward it. The sound of our own bodies was the sound the bags wanted. They grew louder. They tried to be us. We hit the light and then dirt and then the good rough edges of old stone.\n\nBehind us, Aava\u2019s laugh skittered along the ground and tried to borrow my spine. \u201cCome again, little Iivari,\u201d she said, and I could hear how she was making my name into a handle. \u201cBring your friend. We have songs you will like. We have ways of breathing you do not know yet.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t stop until the ferry pulled away, smaller and smelling like a lie. We didn\u2019t stop until we were on the mainland and the gulls felt like someone else\u2019s problem. We didn\u2019t stop until we slid under the bench by the tram stop where Sisu had hid a lump of sugared pulla beneath a napkin someone had mistaken for a cloud. We ate\u2014the sugar stuck in our mouths in a way that felt like the plastic felt on the island, and I made a face\u2014and then lay on our backs and stared at the underside of the city.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not all right,\u201d Sisu said eventually. He doesn\u2019t say things like that unless he knows he can be useful afterward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d I started, and then my wings laid their hands on my shoulder blades in that pins-and-needles way again. There was a weight to them I had not known before, like wet leaves. \u201cShe\u2019s building a ship.\u201d It seemed the only useful thing to say. \u201cA ship that will blot out the tram lines. A ship that will make the sky into a bag. She\u2019ll pull the wind in and the wind won\u2019t remember its name.\u201d\n\nSisu turned a crumb in his paws. He didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cWe can cut knots,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can cut until our cuts connect. We can tell the older pixies. We can talk to the ones under the bridges, the ones who tie tin-foil streamers to iron and call it a ritual. We can visit the ferry man who feeds us sometimes and pretend not to. We can chew through the cords of her drying lines. We can ask the storm crows for a favor. We can sit on the lip of the drainpipe and wait for her ship to go up, then pull.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot,\u201d I said (half of me said) and \u201cWe must\u201d (another half of me said), \u201clet her take the boy.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged with his undignified honesty. \u201cYou will tell me not to bite children,\u201d he said. \u201cYou always do. But you want to. It\u2019s in your eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to bite anyone,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to show him the wind the way it is by itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if he thinks that\u2019s boring?\u201d\n\nHe looked away and I looked at his ear and thought about how easily plastic remembers the shape of a body that leans on it. Sisu yawned in the ancient way of his kind, long and head-tipped, stretching his teeth to the measure of his life. He put his head on my hip. \u201cYou need to sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cYou rattle. You\u2019ll rattle yourself apart.\u201d\n\nI yawned too, because we are ridiculous when we love someone. I lay and listened to the tram. I let the scuffed underside of the bench watch over me. Somewhere a bag snagged on a branch and tried to become a flag, then gave up and became a noise. I slept.\n\nI dreamed in plastic. In the dream, the city was a bottle. I was walking along the rim. Sisu was below, in the thread that wrapped the bottle, pacing, reading a story in the weave. Aava walked above me, upside down, as if the sky had gravity for her alone. The boy was a shadow behind her. I shouted and got a handful of my own echo. I jumped and my wings caught and carried and then didn\u2019t. I fell and it did not hurt, because in dreams the ground is an idea and you can argue with it. I woke to Sisu\u2019s paw on my forehead, light as the idea of rain.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s at the drain,\u201d he said.\n\nWe went still. We listened.\n\nFootsteps in the courtyard above. A voice we knew threaded through them, the old caretaker humming. Snow melts and reveals the old world\u2019s secrets: bottles half-buried in the ground, a spoon that fell where a hand couldn\u2019t reach, a single mitten hardened like a shell. Spring reveals other things too. We watched the sliver of light. We watched for the shadow of boots.\n\nThey came. The caretaker\u2019s boots framed the crack. He bent. In his hands, a loop of blue plastic went from circle to knot to uselessness, tightened to strain his fingers, then loosened again. I could see his concentration in the way his tongue touched a tooth. He muttered something that could have been a spell and was likely \u201cwhere did I put that thing.\u201d He threaded the loop through the gate latch and pulled and set the knot, proud of his work.\n\nI held my breath. Not because of the gate or the knot, but because of the way his hand held the loop. It looked like a noose for something not human. It looked like a way the city taught itself tricks. I felt the rough of the bench under my back as if it had hands. Sisu\u2019s tail tightened around my wrist.\n\nThe caretaker straightened. He kicked a pile of leaves half-heartedly with the toe of his boot. Something scurried. He made a little Ehh noise and laughed at himself. He turned and went away across the yard, whistling like a kettle getting going.\n\n\u201cHe is nothing,\u201d Sisu said.\n\n\u201cHe is nothing,\u201d I echoed. \u201cHe is everything. He locks gates so we have to take the long way.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe brave in small things,\u201d Sisu said gently. He nibbled at my sleeve, making it tidy. \u201cAnd in big things if you must. But you should eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you ate was plastic flavored sugar. That\u2019s not eating. That\u2019s memory of eating.\u201d\n\nSo we ate, again, in the irregular way we\u2019ve always had: pieces of a pretzel knot, a dot of butter scraped from the lip of a take-away box, lentils someone had dropped like a blessing. I licked the salt off my fingers and it tasted of coins and rain. I felt steadier. Small animals should not be hungry. They come undone then. I am not a small animal. But I forget to eat.\n\nWhen the light had folded itself into the windows like napkins, we went up to the roof. It is my favorite hour. The tram lights draw a necklace around the city. The gulls give up their insults and practice embarrassment in a quieter voice. A dog barks and then doesn\u2019t. Someone turns on a radio and you find yourself borrowing a moment of their sadness and thinking it\u2019s yours, then giving it back without being rude. Sisu sat with his forepaws tucked, a perfect loaf. I sat with my legs out and my wings fighting with the thought of being wings. The air was thin and not thin, exactly right for telling secrets to.\n\n\u201cPromise me something,\u201d I said.\n\nHe told me with the small tilt of his head to go on.\n\n\u201cIf the wind goes into a bag,\u201d I said. \u201cIf she pulls it in and it forgets itself. If I get caught and don\u2019t get short of breath the way I should, if I think the plastic is a wall of music. If I smile without meaning to. If I start to like the way it squeaks.\u201d I swallowed, and even the swallow squeaked in my mind. \u201cYou must be worse than me. Not better. Worse. Bite. Bite me if you have to. Hard.\u201d\n\nSisu looked at the tram lights. \u201cWe don\u2019t bite the ones we love,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cExcept to remind them.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\nHe sighed. It made his whole body become a hand opening. He put his paw on my knee. \u201cI will remind you,\u201d he said.\n\nWe listened to the city think. We listened to the water holding and letting go and holding again at the edge of the day. Somewhere down on the street, a girl ran and laughed; that laugh rose and caught on the lip of the roof and stayed for a moment near us like a moth. I folded my wings. They crackled like paper. My shoulder blades hurt as though something inside me was trying to remember a different shape.\n\n\u201cYou were almost caught,\u201d Sisu said into the silence. \u201cDo you want to tell someone?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cNo.\u201d There was a patch of tar on the roof that looked like a lion if you tilted your head. I tilted mine. It did not help. \u201cIf I tell, they will say what you said. Cut knots. Tell the ferry man. The ritual bridges. The storm crows. They will make committees. They will write songs about scissors. And the boy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014will be a boy. He will be a boy that fills his pockets with rocks and keeps going. We cannot cut the pockets out of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can warn him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot. You do not speak boy. He hears you as noise. As plastic. As something to be handled. He does not think there is a tiny city under the city he lives in. He thinks there is only his own feet and the places they can go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can be loud.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will scare him and then he will be grateful for the one who tells him there is nothing to be scared of. You will make Aava\u2019s voice make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I bite him?\u201d\n\nSisu did not dignify that with an answer. I laughed, but it came out like a cough. The humor of being a person who cannot be seen by most people is not really humor. It\u2019s a trick your ribs play on you so you can do your next thing.\n\n\u201cSleep,\u201d Sisu said. \u201cTomorrow we go to the bridges. We make the choir of scissors. We bring them to the dock at dusk. We sing, we cut, we pull. We scatter her ship like the gulls scatter chips. For now, sleep. Please. Please, little Iiv.\u201d\n\nI slept. I dreamt a different dream\u2014the old one where the tram stops and everyone on it turns their heads toward me at once because they can see. It is a bad dream for me because the faces have something of the kind killer in them. And there is also the cat. There is always also the cat. In the dream it doesn\u2019t pounce. It waits, patient, as if it knows it will always have time.\n\nMorning came in the way it does here, gray and then suddenly ridiculous with light. We were up before there were whistles. We went down into the belly of the city, into the places where tin meets water and the sound likes to fold itself and sit still. The others were there: S\u00e1ga with her hair like copper wire you could fix a radio with; old Totti with his scarf tied the wrong way around; a girl who called herself Kaarna because she loved the word for bark, not the sound a dog makes, the skin of a tree. They had brought thread and pins and those scissors that you can\u2019t open all the way if you are small but you can move and make sing anyway.\n\n\u201cWe cut at dusk,\u201d S\u00e1ga said in a voice like a sock you do not throw away. \u201cWhen the wind thinks about tiredness but has not made any decisions yet. She will lift; we cut. The wind will be guilty. It will drop her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will not,\u201d Totti said flatly. \u201cThe wind is old. It leaves guilt to others. It will go on. It is what it does.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine. We will be guilty then. But I prefer others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cut,\u201d Kaarna said. \u201cThat is what we do. We are not judges. We are scissors.\u201d\n\nThey looked at me. In the community under the benches, under the bridges, inside the trams with the dust, there are no leaders, not really, but there are those with louder stories at any given moment, and I had the boy in mine. I could feel them asking, Iivari, is this story necessary? Is it yours? Are you making it bigger because you like big things?\n\n\u201cShe will raise a ship that wraps half the sky,\u201d I said. \u201cShe wants it to curl over our roofs like a wave and stay. We will wake to everything a little softer. Softer is not our style. We are hard like bread. We are sharp like wind. We are not meant to breathe someone else\u2019s breath.\u201d\n\nThey nodded. Words can make small hard things stand up with you for a while. We set the time. We made a little pile of pins so they would feel like comrades. We ate the last of Totti\u2019s dried berry thing that tasted like memory of summer and shoe leather. We waited.\n\nIt rained and stopped. It hailed a little, tiny glass beads the gulls were offended by. The harbor sounded like itself. A woman near the fish stall said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d and then bought it anyway. A man yelled \u201cTwo euros,\u201d as if that were a punchline. We stole a paper napkin and folded it into a boat and set it to sail in a gutter. We watched it go under a car and come out the other side as if it had learned something you can only learn under a car. It had. It had learned to be darker. That was all.\n\nAt dusk, we went.\n\nWe were not the only ones arming ourselves with small sharpness. Oma Hilma, who sells berries and speaks to the ravens in a language that makes them look embarrassed, had tucked a bread knife into her apron strings. The ferry man had a folding knife in his pocket where no one would bother him for it. The boy? He brought what boys bring: faith.\n\nWe slid along the dock. We found the rusted chain. We left our careful footprints (I am too vain about this: my footprints are nothing, but I like them). We reached the lip of the dry dock and the nest of breath.\n\nIt had grown. It had become a mouth talking to the sky. It had become brave. The bags were taut and full. They were ready. Aava stood in the center, and the boy beside her, and the other pixies with their slick eyes, and for a second I thought I did see a bat caught and nicely soothed and pale with sleep inside a white bag near the top of the structure. Maybe she did have mercy. Maybe her mercy and mine only wore different shoes.\n\nThe wind came like a childhood friend who\u2019d been bragging in other towns and came home to prove it. It put both hands on the nest and lifted. The nest answered yes. The ropes went from lines to songs. Aava\u2019s hair, her plastic hair, snapped and snapped and then learned a different tune and lay obedient.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d S\u00e1ga said. \u201cNow.\u201d\n\nWe moved like ants with knives. We went for the second rope\u2014the fourth\u2014the ninth. We went for the places where the handles had been worried by frost. We went for the knots made with cold hands. We cut. We cut like a lullaby you sing to put a monster to sleep. We cut, and the monster laughed, because laughter and crying look the same from inside a bag.\n\nUp above, Aava swayed. She threw her arms as if she were a conductor and the orchestra was the plastic and the air. The boy held on to a handle. He laughed. It got into my bones. I looked at him and I did the wrong thing. I wished for a second that I were big. Big enough to take his hand. Big enough to put him behind me and use all the words I have that keep monsters off, which is a dozen, which is none at all when the monster uses the words themselves as handles. Big. Big. Big as a gull.\n\n\u201cIivari,\u201d Sisu said sharply. \u201cYou\u2019re not biting. It\u2019s worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cCut,\u201d I said. \u201cCut.\u201d\n\nWe did. The second rope sighed and slipped. The fourth let go and there was a change in the nest, a tilt like a thought that has decided to be done with a conversation. The ninth, oh, the ninth was stubborn. Kaarna sang to it, quiet under the din, a song with a bark in it, and the rope remembered it was only rope and slackened.\n\nThe nest shuddered.\n\nAava faltered for the first time. She looked down. She saw us. She saw the glitter of pins. She saw Sisu (how can you be so handsome when you are scared, I wanted to ask later) braced with all four paws, tail around my wrist, teeth in a handle. She looked at me as if she could remember every face she had ever loved and knew what this face was.\n\n\u201cNot tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cSurely you can see\u2014this is bigger than\u2014\u201d\n\nI do not like when people say bigger. I cut the sentence instead.\n\nEverything went wrong with grace. The nest did not collapse. It sighed and reared. A hundred bags let go of other bags like friendships end, not with a word but a slackness. The whole thing rose and rolled and tipped and\u2014my heart could not keep up with it. There are changes so large that your small muscle cannot catch them all. The boy slipped. His hand came off the handle. He pinwheeled, a small human windmill, laughing still with his mouth and forgetting to with his eyes.\n\nI ran for him. My wings gave me a fist of lift. Two fists. Not enough. Idiot wings. I leaped. Sisu leaped between me and the ground and did a thing I have seen him do when he would catch crumbs: he made himself the shape the world wanted and the world put the crumb in him.\n\nHe caught the boy.\n\nHe caught the boy\u2019s sleeve, which was a universe to him, and he made his body into resistance. The boy\u2019s laugh popped like a bubble. He made a sound exactly like when a person flips a coin and it doesn\u2019t flip and they have to pretend they meant it. He looked down and saw me and Sisu and that we were not nothing.\n\nAava moved with the speed of someone who has braided her life into ropes. She reached, caught, hauled, wrapped. The boy rose again, angles went wrong, came right. He was back inside the breath of plastic, the canopy, the waterless water. He held a handle again. He didn\u2019t laugh. He didn\u2019t cry. He put his head against the bag nearest his cheek and it cupped him back the way a hand does a pet.\n\nWe lay panting. We are small. Breathing is a whole job. I lay and watched the nest steady. I watched the ropes ask what had just happened. I watched the wind decide to keep being itself anyway. Sisu put his paw on my shoulder. He was shaking the way a tram shakes at a turn. He said the word he always says when the world decides it will keep going.\n\n\u201cEat.\u201d\n\nI swallowed the word. There was nothing in my mouth but the taste of the boy\u2019s sleeve and the high-tin taste of the pin and my own blood a little. I could fit ten pains in my chest. I could fit a whole harbor in my chest. Neither of those facts were useful. I didn\u2019t care. I carried them anyway.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d S\u00e1ga said down the rope. \u201cAgain. Again.\u201d\n\nWe cut. We cut as if to put out a fire: not to stop everything but to change the order of it. The ropes recalcified. The nest leaned\u2014I imagined it. I spoke to the bag nearest me and it ignored me which is all you can ask of plastic. The gulls had come to watch. One dropped a clam and missed the rocks. The clam thought about its god.\n\nAnd then the wind changed.\n\nIt does that. It owed us nothing. It had been lifting from the west and then it came from the north, and the breath inside the nest had to relearn itself. For a moment, the whole work trembled in its making, like a baby thinking about crying then deciding the ceiling is interesting. In that moment, Kaarna\u2019s bark-song became a growl. Totti did something clever with his scarf and a rusty hook. Sisu did not let go of my wrist. Aava did not let go of her dream. The boy looked at me and did this thing that boys do when the world opens: he winked. Idiot. Brave. The most annoying kind of brave.\n\nI think if the tram had passed then, if a single passenger had looked out the window at the dry dock, if a radio had gone quiet at the right moment, if Oma Hilma had taken her knife from her apron and whistled, if a cat had sneezed, we would have cut the ship from the sky and it would have gone up anyway because a thousand cuts do not always make a fall. Things hang on. That is what they do.\n\nBut none of those happened. The wind did what it wanted. The nest rose and this time it went not up, but out, a huge slow rolling like the breath of a sleeping wall. The ropes went taut and stayed there. We cut and cut and the cuts made small white smiles and the smiles closed because plastic does not like to be reminded of mouth. The ship\u2014which was not a ship but something that wanted to be a mouth, perhaps\u2014shuddered and found itself.\n\nAava raised her hands. The handles in her dress clapped. The boy held on. The ship slid toward the harbor-light and away from us. We had not stopped a thing. We had not made a start. We had merely shown up with our little hunger for the world to be correct. Often, that is not enough.\n\nWe lay there and watched. Sisu\u2019s breath came in hiccups. He tucked his head into my side and made a small high-live noise that means please, for a moment, make the world smaller. I put my hand on his head. I told my wing to be quiet. It shuffled like pages. We watched.\n\n\u201cI will\u2014\u201d I said, then stopped.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d he said automatically. \u201cSleep. Bite. Cut. Repeat.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014I will go to the boy,\u201d I said. \u201cI will not talk. I will be in his shoe. I will be in his pockets. I will put an idea in him that is not a knife. I will make him love the sound of wind through birch leaves more than the sound of plastic. I will make him love the pause between gull curses. I will make him love his breath outside anything but his own chest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already there,\u201d Sisu said without opening his eyes. \u201cYou are all over this city like a rumor. You\u2019re under his feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop being wise,\u201d I said sharply. \u201cIt confuses me.\u201d\n\nHe smiled into my side. I touched his ear. It was cold and thin and filled with listening. I put my mouth near it and said, very quietly, \u201cThank you for catching him.\u201d\n\nSisu\u2019s smile shifted. \u201cOf course. You would have been unbearable if he had fallen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are unbearable as it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try harder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always try. That is your trouble.\u201d\n\nThe ship moved until we couldn\u2019t hear its breath anymore. The harbor settled. The plastic in the city went on doing what plastic does: soften, shine, repeat. The trams sang. The city was itself. We were two small beings under it and we had done something that was not enough and we were going to do it again. I closed my eyes. I let sleep come like a bag I could refuse, but didn\u2019t, this one time. I let the wind go through me. I let my wings be heavy. I let the city carry me a little and believed that was all right.\n\nWe slept badly.\n\nIn the morning I woke with my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth, not because of plastic, I told myself, because of sugar and fear. I woke to Sisu chewing on nothing, the way he does when he practices chewing just in case. I woke to a sound near the gutter that was not our sound.\n\nA plastic bag had found its way to our drainpipe. It clung there, a jellyfish, pulsing. It had writing on it in a language I could not read. It had one handle torn. It had the stubborn look of a tourist who will not ask for directions. The wind plucked it and plucked it again, and it held.\n\nI watched it and thought of Aava Kassinen and her dress and her hands and the boy\u2019s sleeve. I thought of the way my wings had not carried me and how their weight felt like a promise nobody asked me to keep. I thought about the cat. I thought, too, about a part of myself that had nothing to do with wings, that knew the feel of wood fibers under teeth, that could hear a splitting grain from three rooms away. I put my hand over my mouth so Sisu would not see my first thought.\n\nThen I got up.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d Sisu said without opening his eyes.\n\n\u201cAfter,\u201d I said. I climbed the pipe. Not with wings. With ten little habits of grip. The bag watched me with the face of a thing about to become smaller. I reached it. I put my palm on it. I felt the slick cool. I whispered into it with my breath, and what I said was not any kind of magic. It was a list: trams, gulls, old salt, rye bread, morning fog, coffee steam, pavement grit, first snow, last snow, bikes that do not rattle when they should. I put all of that into the bag and I made it so that, for a second, it remembered: it had come from somewhere else and it had been something else and it did not need to be here anymore.\n\nThe bag let go.\n\nI am not Aava. My hands shook. I climbed down. Sisu was awake and pretending not to be worried. He sighed. \u201cEat,\u201d he said.\n\nWe ate. We sat. We watched the city go about its large chore. We made plans with string and pins. We told ourselves the boy would be all right because we needed to. We told ourselves the wind would remember its own name. We told ourselves we were big enough to do something. We told ourselves the story about the pixie and the mouse who did not stop until the city remembered what its breath felt like.\n\nUnder all that, something else spoke, a little voice like a seed under the soil, and I did not listen to it. Not yet. Not then. If I had listened then, if I had put my ear to the wood of the bench and heard the rumor of the truth that had carried me this far\u2014what kind of story would this be?\n\nSo let it be this: we got up, we took our small weapons, and we went to work. The day cracked its knuckles. The harbor pretended indifference. A gull landed beside us, cocked its head, and screamed the way they scream when they are not screaming at anything. Sisu screamed back, because he is ridiculous. I laughed. He laughed. The city felt, for a breath, correct.\n\nAnd somewhere above, the ship made of too much lifted and tilted and waited for us to be ready to cut it into a sky again.We started with the bridges because bridges remember. They are the spines of the city, and spines hold grudges and grace with the same stubbornness. We went to Pitk\u00e4silta first, because everyone goes there first when they mean business. The long bridge stretched itself like an old soldier and pretended not to listen while we slipped into the underspace where iron sweats and pigeons give speeches. S\u00e1ga had come already and chalked a circle on the moss-dark stone, a tiny parliament. Totti arrived late, shaking rain from his scarf and scolding the droplets as if they were nephews. Kaarna brought the tinfoil streamers that the bridge-folk love, strips of moon that you can tie to anything you hope will keep you.\n\nThe bridge pixies were there in the places you only see when you are so tired your eyes look for places to sit down. They climbed out from between bolts and washers, out of cracks that looked like dried smiles, out from behind the great iron ribs, dusty as long coats. They had the glance of people who live always under something that can fall and choose to take pride in that. They looked at our pins like a choir sizing up new scores.\n\n\u201cWe need a sound,\u201d S\u00e1ga said, turning her copper-wire hair into a rope with her fingers as she spoke. \u201cNot just cutting. Cutting is a rhythm, yes, but we need dissonance too. The bags like harmony. They like sameness. We need to bring a quarrel to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bridge can quarrel,\u201d said a little man who called himself Valtteri and had the nose of a weathervane. \u201cPitk\u00e4silta knows how to argue. Ask anyone. Half the city once stood on this side, and half on that, and they threw songs and stones at each other and called it politics. I will give you a bend in the wind. I will give you a draft that cannot make up its mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Totti said, and the word fell with a clack. \u201cTie your tin then. Make it bicker.\u201d\n\nWe wove tinfoil into cheap magic. We tied streamers to the low guts of the bridge where shoes cannot see, where mice courts are held. We made the bridge tut at the wind, then coax, then snarl, then coo. We hung bottle-caps we had hammered flat so they would glitter with disdain. Kaarna lay on her back and sang to the bolts, a song like bark scraped with a knife to see what color is underneath. The bridge shivered and then settled as if it remembered old winters. I pressed my cheek to a patch of iron that held the imprint of a human hand and said the only thing I know how to say to objects that bear weight: thank you, but in a tone that suggests I am not finished asking.\n\nWe went next to the little bridges, to the ones that think they are jokes and then become serious all at once when the river remembers who it is. We went to the wooden arch near T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 that smells like a drawer; to the low cement span that ducks its head under the tram rails near Hakaniemi, where the market voices blow through like leaves. Every bridge gave us a different way to argue. One gave us a sigh. One gave us a complaint that had not found words yet. One gave us a trick draft that tickles the ear and makes you turn when you meant to go straight. We tied, we sang, we swapped pins for bits of rust as if those were fair trades. By noon, the city had taken on a faint burr, a beautiful impatience. The wind in its throat had a new rasp.\n\n\u201cStorm crows,\u201d Sisu said, licking bridge grit from his paws as if it were sugar. \u201cWe promised them the first choice of fish guts for a week.\u201d\n\nWe crossed the city by riding the shadows of trousers like ferries and hitching a lift on the cuff of a lady who had sewn three loose buttons to keep from thinking about her husband. At the tram stop the busker with the red scarf was already playing, and the violin threw lines up into the morning, bright threads that caught on the underside of clouds. I stopped there longer than I should have and the music did the thing it does to my wings, laid a heat there that did not ask permission. The notes walked along my ribs until my breath had to move aside and go elsewhere for a time. The busker glanced down and then back up, because sometimes we are nothing and sometimes we are a quiver in the corner of someone\u2019s eye and that is almost the same as a friend.\n\nWe found the footbridge to Seurasaari and did not use it. We went under, because we are loyal to our ways. The water held itself in a chill hand and let us step from root to rock to root as if it remembered we had given it something once. The island smelled of wet wood, old roast, burnt sugar, ash. The houses there keep the ghosts of every stove that ever cooked a summer stew. The crows were lined along the fence like punctuation. They watched us come up the path and pretended they were not waiting for an appointment.\n\n\u201cVaris-rouva,\u201d S\u00e1ga said, bowing with a flourish that would have torn a hole in a dress if she had been wearing one. \u201cQueen of quarrels. Collector of shiny lies. We come to ask for beaks.\u201d\n\nThe queen stepped forward, disgraceful in her beauty, one ragged primary feather like a scratch down her side. She considered us with the eye that makes you doubt your own name and then, as if she did not want to waste our time, spoke. Her voice had road in it. It had trash fire. It had fish scales, always fish scales.\n\n\u201cYou eat your bread,\u201d she said. \u201cWe eat your crowns. You cut your knots. We pull at your sleeves. You come because the big white that pretends to be sky is full of food-smell and no food. You come because your little breaths stick to it and it makes you quiet. We don\u2019t like quiet. It\u2019s a trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will bring guts,\u201d Sisu said. He said the word with professional interest. \u201cAnd crisp edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cEdges,\u201d the queen croaked as if tasting. \u201cYou will bring the small sharp white that wraps the fish and we will break it with our feet. We will not be fooled by the fish that is not a fish. We will tear at the handles because the handles are the only part that admits to being a handle. We will fly where you cannot stand, and we will talk to the gulls because the gulls can be bribed. They love money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no money,\u201d Kaarna said, laughing under her breath.\n\n\u201cThat is why gulls love you,\u201d said the queen, and the crows all made that strangled bark that means they have found themselves funny. \u201cBring us the guts. Put them where the air tastes of iron and salt. We will meet you at the dock when the shadow of the cathedral lies like a folded shirt. Two of ours will go now, because they like the smell of trouble.\u201d\n\nTwo peeled from the fence with the casual arrogance that attends people with wings that work. One was as narrow as a ribbon, the other had a beak chipped like a broken tooth. They came to us, stepped, dignified, and the chipped one eyed Sisu as if he were a challenge handsome enough to take. Sisu did not flinch. He blinked slowly and tilted his head a degree. The crow made a sound that said acknowledgment without conceding anything.\n\n\u201cJaakko,\u201d said the ribbon-crow.\n\n\u201cK\u00e4ry,\u201d said the chipped. Smoke. He had the voice of a fire gone too quickly out.\n\n\u201cWe have a busker,\u201d I said before I could stop myself. \u201cHe might tune the air for you. He can tune anything. If we put his bow in your hearing, you will tear the right bit of wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cMusic,\u201d said Jaakko with the cautious contempt of someone who has been fooled by a flute once. \u201cFine. Bring it quick. The white is hungry.\u201d\n\nWe left the crows counting their bright things and went in search of human timing. The busker had moved to the far end of Esplanadi, under the little trees that scratch their names into the light. I stood close enough to see the thumbnail-sized callus on his left index finger and the burn scar on his right wrist that did not belong to a violinist but did belong to someone who makes soup. He had a jar with coins and a clover. I put my coin mirror near the clover, very close, so that when the jar moved there would be a small clink and he might think, what is that luck doing there.\n\nWe made ourselves large in the shape only we know how to make and he saw something like a ripple in the shade. His bow hesitated. He changed key. He shifted into a tune that had windows opening in it. Sisu flicked his tail in admiration. I leaned in and set my half-blue feather against the hair of the bow, not where it would tangle, just where it would ride. The feather knew the game and kept quiet.\n\nThe note that came next was not magic because it did not solve anything. It was better than that. It made the air complicated. It made the handles jolt a little where they thought they had settled into a pleasure. It put grit into plastic\u2019s morning. The busker frowned as if he had heard a door open that should have stayed shut. He played on, and we carried that new kink in the note with us like a seed we didn\u2019t know how to plant.\n\nWe took the ferry man our plan and our childishness. He was on his smoke break, which he had no intention of enjoying because the breeze would not commit. He had a kind look, that bad kind, the kind that makes you want to be good because someone expects it of you without saying it. He looked toward the dock with the way of someone who can measure distance in words. He already had a folding knife. He already had a pole with a hook. He did not need our advice. We gave it anyway because giving advice is a way to ask someone to see you.\n\n\u201cDelay,\u201d I said, and it came out a plea. \u201cJust a moment when a line cannot find its cleat and the gulls all decide to tell a joke at once. Make a human-shaped mistake. We will be in it.\u201d\n\nHe nodded once as if he had decided that grace can wear blue work trousers. He flicked his cigarette into the water and looked guilty in a theatrical way so the cormorant on the buoy would have something to judge him for. He didn\u2019t look at us when he said, \u201cA bag tried to have the propeller yesterday. We had to cut it free. It came up shining as if it had dreamed it was a jellyfish. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn the late afternoon we followed the smell of laundry that wasn\u2019t laundry to Katajanokka, to the alley where Aava Kassinen dries what she calls her silks. She had strung lines from downspout to lamp to chimney and the whole block wore her like a veil. The bags twitched when shadows crossed them. They made skins for the wind. Each one had a logo that once meant an errand. Together the logos made a language that wasn\u2019t a language but a pressure.\n\nWe went with the clumsy stealth of heroes and slipped under the hanging nothings. Sisu\u2019s whiskers wrote angry words in the air. Kaarna hummed to herself so softly you could pretend you couldn\u2019t hear. I took out the pin and chose a bag that said THANK YOU in eight languages and no apologies. I punctured the corner near the seam and the bag sighed and became less of itself. I felt it let go. It tried to pull me with it. I said all right, then, and stopped before I went lightheaded.\n\nThe creased ones found us. Not all of Aava\u2019s helpers are pixies. Some are what we become when we forget we are not laundry. A girl with a green ribbon that had once been more than plastic came around the corner with her eyes so clean it hurt. Behind her was a boy with palms shiny with handling. Their faces were that strange good: as if sleep had restored them, but only as far as the last fold. They stood, not blocking the path, but suggesting that the path had always been the other way.\n\n\u201cYou are very busy,\u201d the girl said, not unkind. \u201cYou will be tired by dusk.\u201d\n\n\u201cRest is for after,\u201d S\u00e1ga said, straightening a streamer. \u201cOr never. Either suits me.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d said the boy. His voice had a summer in it that this city only sometimes provides. \u201cIt\u2019s nicer in there. The sound is closer to the face. She will show you how to not mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mind,\u201d I said, and he did flinch at that, the smallest tilt of a leaf in wind. I took out my mirror coin and held it at my knee so it was not a threat. The coin showed him a crooked picture of himself, eye like a galaxy, mouth like a line drawn by a child who is not ashamed of his pencil. I have done this before. A person will forget and forget and forget and then their face will insist on itself in a shiny thing and something comes back that the city can use. He looked in the coin and between two breaths I saw it: the green ribbon when it had been a leaf. He closed his eyes. He opened them. There was wet in one. He shook his head.\n\n\u201cI am tired,\u201d he said, and there it was, the word that can be a spell for both sleeping and waking. He turned and left so quickly it looked like a gust. The girl stayed long enough to say, \u201cShe is making something that does not melt. That will be our winter roof when winter forgets itself. What will you make?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeftovers,\u201d Kaarna said solemnly, and there was bite in it.\n\nWe ate none of the day, which is to say by dusk we were hungry enough to mistake scruples for crumbs. We gathered at the dry dock with our small army. The crows were silhouettes with decisions. Oma Hilma stood in her apron with the bread knife, and there was a red smear of lingon on the blade that made me think of holidays. The ferry man was a shape near the ramp, an inconvenience to himself. The busker did not come down. He stood on the quay above and sent a line of sound like a lifeline. It caught on the bags and slid and caught again. The wind that had spent the afternoon crawling between buildings came clean off the water, new-napped, just dangerous enough.\n\nAava\u2019s ship had fattened. That was the only word for it. It was rounder, more certain, less like a tangle and more like a decision. She had laced the handles through handles until the whole thing had become a woven refusal. The boy stood inside the clear belly of it like an idea placed under a bell jar. He saw us and did not wave. He pressed his palm to the plastic and it made an oval around his hand the way milk makes an oval around the spoon.\n\nWe attacked our part, which never feels like an attack. It feels like laundry, like unlearning a bow. We cut on the off-beats. We made the arguments we had practiced under the bridges. The crows went for the handles. They hung on them and let their weight worry the plastic until it made little noises of complaint. Jaakko made a sound like a knife across a bottle and K\u00e4ry made a sound like a joke told in the wrong company and both sounds had purpose.\n\nThe busker played the note that made my wings heat. It fed the crows courage they did not admit to needing. The ferry man fumbled expertly with a rope so there was a knot that would want to become a knot at the wrong moment. Oma Hilma held up a fish gut on her knife like a flag and yelled something in a kitchen language that got under the ship and prodded. The ship moved as if it had thought and its thought had been interrupted. The sound it made came up through the dock into my feet and made me taste dandelion.\n\nWe were seen. It was inevitable and unimportant. Aava dropped the premise of not being cruel and sent the creased ones out on ropes that were nearly ropes and nearly hands. Handles became lassos. Kaarna cried out as one settled around her middle and found the place where breath is a hinge. We went for her with ugly love. The plastic resisted like a story that does not want to be told except the flattering bits. I stabbed with my pin and Sisu used his teeth the way prayers are used when the approved ones fail. The handle tore. It did not break; it tore. There is a difference. Kaarna fell into me and swore in tree language and I felt the bruise I would have in the morning and was grateful for it because a bruise is something the body understands.\n\nAava lifted her arms. The clapping of her dress was applause and accusation. She shouted something I could not hear because the wind did not want me to. The boy looked up at the note, that busker\u2019s braid of sound, and I watched a thought land on his face and not be hunted away. He turned his head a degree. He put two fingers in his mouth and blew a whistle he thought he did not know how to make. It did not carry to us, but it did something to the space inside the ship, which is to say it made a pocket of ordinary there. For a second I saw his hair be hair and not a place for static to live.\n\nThe ship bucked. The ferry man made his mistake and the gulls took the cue and told five jokes at once and forgot the punchline and laughed anyway. The crows pulled and the bridge wind argued with itself and the busker hit the note that was a window breaking. I jumped for a line that was not a line, just noise pretending to be one. My wings flared in a way they had been threatening to for days. They did not stop me from falling. They slowed the idea of the fall and in that margin Sisu did the thing we had promised. He bit me.\n\nPain has as many dialects as Finnish. This one had the honesty of a slap on a cold morning. It pulled the plastic squeak out of my ears and deposited me unceremoniously in the scrape of stone. I shouted a word that a busker would not put in a song and got up, which is a grace. Sisu shook his head to rid himself of my taste and looked apologetic in the way of someone who has given you a gift you asked for and wishes it had been nicer.\n\nWe got Kaarna out. We didn\u2019t get anyone else. We cut and cut and the cuts made the ship look festive, which was humiliating. The ship swelled again. It lifted and went sideways in a slow majestic indecision that meant she had learned something from us and would not give us the same angle twice.\n\n\u201cBack,\u201d S\u00e1ga said, not cowardly, which is a way I want to be when I am old. \u201cShe knows our knives. We keep the knives, we keep our hands. We cut again tomorrow when we are hungrier. We will not be hungry enough if we go now.\u201d\n\nWe vanished in the way only people who are supposed to be gone can. The crows took one last handle and tore it in contempt. The busker let the note go because notes are not meant to be captured. The ferry man made a knot that untied itself the moment it thought no one was watching and smiled at the convenience of it. Oma Hilma made a tutting sound at the ship measured in grams and went home to wash it out of her apron strings.\n\nBack on the roof the city tried to make itself seem simple. The tram sang in its practiced good voice. The cathedral\u2019s steps held their breath like someone taking a photograph of themselves. My wings felt like two bags of warm flour tied to my back. Sisu shaved butter off the promise of a breakfast with his teeth and laid it on a piece of bread that had no business still being a bread. We ate and did not talk until the silence had the decency to stop being proud.\n\n\u201cShe learns,\u201d he said finally, pushing a crumb toward me with one fingernail as if he were a waiter and this a theater. \u201cSo do we. We will not go at her edges again. We will go at the middle. If the middle is a lie, it will not take a cut. If the middle is a knot, there will be ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has put the boy at the middle,\u201d I said. \u201cOr perhaps he put himself there. I think he thinks he can steer. I think she told him that even a child can steer if he is polite to the wind.\u201d\n\nI lay back and the tar lion on the roof became, with effort, a lion. The truth that had been tapping like a polite knuckle at the underside of my bench had come out onto the roof with us, a cat with patience. It walked the edges of my thought as if they were a fence. It told me something in the way that cats do, by refusing to make it easy. It said that the boy would not be taken away from this by a knife or a word. It said that he would not be taken away at all. It said that he would walk from it or he would not. It suggested, as politely as possible, that I had loved the idea of being the thing that saves him more than I loved the boy.\n\nSisu watched my face shift and did not ask. He has the discipline to let you come to your own bad news. He went to the edge of the roof and examined the city for holes. He came back with the kind of information you store in your cheek like sugar.\n\n\u201cThere is a cat,\u201d he said. \u201cDown on the blue balcony opposite. It has a ring around its neck. A plastic ring from a six-pack, one of those white handcuffs that the sea leaves on the doorstep. It is purring as if it has never had a bad day. It is the wrong kind of advertisement.\u201d\n\nWe went to look because you have to look when a metaphor turns up at your house and knocks with its paw. The cat was ginger and had elected to be beautiful rather than merely pretty. Around its neck the ring sat like a careless crown. It did not choke him yet. It would. The ring had the same wrong shine as Aava\u2019s dress. The cat met our eyes with the boldness of someone who assumes everyone loves him and is right enough to keep assuming until the day that assumption kills him.\n\n\u201cThat is not my cat,\u201d said Sisu, who likes all cats until they notice him and then likes them more. \u201cBut I will bite it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will un-ring it,\u201d I said. \u201cTomorrow we will cut the middle of a thing too large. Tonight we will cut the ring off a thing that purrs.\u201d\n\nWe found the way across the courtyard and up the drain that had a cracked bracket and then over the eave where the paint had been red when someone had time. We made the leap to the blue balcony because when your friend is dumb you become brave without calling it that. The cat watched us with the mildness of a god. He put his chin up as if showing off the problem.\n\nThe ring was old enough to have a name. It would not admit to it. I held it and it was slick with neck. Sisu braced his forepaws and leaned his weight into the small mercy. The ring hissed. It did not have lungs. It hissed. I put the pin in and felt the point slide along the inside of something that had, once upon a time, held a promise of cold beer and conversation. I pushed. Sisu pulled. The ring gave in the way walls do when they realize the siege will be longer than pride can survive.\n\nWe took it away. The cat shook himself and did not say thank you because he was a cat. He rubbed his face against Sisu with the generosity of someone taking credit for the problem\u2019s solution. He lifted his tail in that way and walked along the balcony rail as if he had discovered balance. The ring lay on the paint like a dropped threat. I put my foot in it and felt the memory of strangling pretend it could still have me. Then I took it and folded it and folded it again and again until it could not remember how to be round.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d Sisu said, in the tone of a person who will pretend not to be proud so you can be. \u201cNow eat.\u201d\n\nWe ate. We watched the ship\u2019s absence in the sky like a bruise that had not come up yet. We made the plan that is not a plan, which is to sleep and then try again. I made a private plan I did not say aloud, which is to find the boy when he is nowhere and put a thread, no, not around his wrist, that would be a handle, but in his pocket, a thread that would tug at him when the plastic sang too sweet. It was a plan of superstition, which is often the only kind that handles children.\n\nIn sleep the city went on without us. It will always go on without us. That is its blessing and its insult. My wings hummed with a hurt that had put a blanket over itself and pretended to be fine. I dreamed a small dream in which the busker came down to the dock and put his violin against the plastic and the plastic said, this one I will keep, and the busker said, you will not, because I am wood and horsehair and human regret and I am more stubborn than a shopping bag. He was right. It was a petty dream. I woke to the sound of rain deciding not to, and Sisu making the sound he makes when he is arguing with sleep as if it owed him money.\n\nMorning arrived with a sneeze. The city scraped its chair back and went to work. We went to the market before it was properly awake and slipped into the shadow of Oma Hilma\u2019s stall. She gave us fish guts with the formality of a priest and we carried them in a paper cup that had once held coffee and now was ordained to carry gratitude. We set the guts at the place the queen had told us, where iron and salt argue, and watched the crows arrive with the self-respect of judges who have packed their own lunches. They ate with their eyes on us, which is how crows forgive.\n\nThe busker was late, which means he had had his own morning. He stood and tuned while the tram sighed and the gulls arrived for their insults. He played the note without thinking about it and made a face that said his fingers remembered something his mind did not. I waved, which did nothing. Sisu scratched behind his ear and left the tiniest fish-smell there so his sleep would have a story.\n\nWe went down to the docks to see what tide the day had. Aava\u2019s ship sat farther out from the lip of the dry dock than before, as if it had been trying its rooms on for size in the night. The creased ones moved inside it like thoughts being rewritten to please someone else. The boy was not there. He had gone home, I told my stomach. He had eaten soup out of a mug and lied about where he had been. He had told his pillow what he would name the ship if anyone let him. He had done none of those things. He was on the rocks near the far end of the dock, with a stick he drew with, pushing the wet, finding the dry under it.\n\nWe watched from a crack that had been put there by a frost that takes compliments badly. He was drawing the outline of a bird. He made the wings too long and then did not correct it. He put a circle in the middle and I thought of a handle.\n\n\u201cDo not,\u201d Sisu said, and I did not, not the thing he was warning me against. I did another thing. I took my thread and a laugh I had not used yet and I knotted the laugh in the thread and I tied the thread, softly, to the button of his coat as he leaned to draw. He did not feel it, of course he did, maybe he did, and the thread lay there like a very thin promise that if the wind asked him what his favorite noise was he would maybe, maybe, answer with birch leaves and not the mouth of a bag.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d Sisu said, because even plots need porridge. \u201cThen cut. Then bite me if I forget to tell you to stop being noble.\u201d\n\nHe meant the middle. He meant we had been slicing the ruffles off a dress and pretending we had altered a bride. He meant it kindly. We stuffed our mouths and our pockets and set our courage in our shoes so it would not be left behind on a bench. We went to the place we had not gone, the square under the belly of Aava\u2019s ship where the ropes gathered into something that was not a keystone because plastic does not admit to stone, but something like it. It was a hub made of handles woven into handles, an ugly daisy of human habit. It pulsed with a living that embarrassed me.\n\nWe crouched beneath it with the city\u2019s worst tools: our attention, our patience, our particular pettiness. We saw how the handles had been braided to allow for stretch, to welcome mistake. We saw how the stretch would snap back if you cut here but sag forever if you cut there. We saw the place you never give anyone in your house: the real drawer with the real scissors in it. It took all day to see it properly. We were bitten by plastic as if it had something like teeth. We were scolded by gulls who thought they were on our side but also thought they deserved more fish. We were watched by the ferry man at his post who did not smile because he was busy holding the shape of his face together for everyone else.\n\nWe began to cut. The pin went in and balked and then became correct. The first strand gave us nothing, which is how you know you have found the middle. The second tried to make a little loop to trap us and we did not put our finger in it, which is a victory. The third made a sound like a very small apology and went. The fourth wanted to be a story and we let it, just for the laugh we had knotted into the thread to remember us later.\n\nWe were halfway through the wrong way to do the right thing when the creased ones came down, in their smooth-eyed sincerity, their careful helpfulness, and a boy\u2019s sleeve brushed my face from above, so close I could smell the damp cotton and the not-yet of soap. He hung there with his hands wrapped in a rope, legs bicycling the air in that way children have when they are about to learn gravity again. He looked down at us with that wink still in him somewhere and I felt something like rescue move its shoulder in my chest, testing the fit.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Sisu breathed, and for once I agreed instantly, because if there is anything I have learned in this city it is that not yet can save your life more often than yes, now.\n\nWe cut, and for the first time that whole made thing ahead of us moved as if its idea had been nicked. It was not a collapse. It was an admission. The handles for a moment did not know their own plan. The wind took a prudent step back as if in case. Aava turned her head a hair\u2019s width. The boy\u2019s fingers slipped a knuckle and then found themselves again. The ferryman blinked and missed a gull stealing a pretzel from a woman\u2019s lap and the woman laughed because she had needed to.\n\nWe were making a hole in the place where breath had been made wrong and letting out just a sliver of its wrongness. It was the smallest success I have ever been so fond of. We did not celebrate because celebration requires lungs that are not currently learning how to be felt again. We put the pin away. We bound the thread. We left. We left because leaving is a craft and we had to be good at something that day.\n\nThe cat was waiting for us on the roof, smug, which is to say he was a cat. He had found a new ring to put his paw through, a child\u2019s bracelet that had not known what would happen to it when it stopped being darling. He offered it to me as if I were missing jewelry. I took it and hung it on a nail because that is one way to tell the city, no, not there, not like that.\n\nSisu fell asleep with his head on my arm and did his small practice chewing, which is how you know he will live forever. My wings hurt like a name said wrong repeatedly. I lay and listened to the wind say its name correctly to itself, once, the way someone says it on a train platform when they are late and cannot help their laugh. I thought of the boy, and the thread, and the middle, and the big, and I did not promise anything to myself except that I would eat in the morning and cut in the afternoon and be bitten if I earned it and that I would try to love the boy for his small ordinary rather than his story. It is harder. It is better. The city approved, not loudly, just by failing to annoy me for five breaths in a row. That is as wild as approval gets here.\n\nIn the middle of the night the rain finally happened. It came in thin clever lines that knew where old leaks lived. Somewhere a bag flapped itself free of a fence and went across the courtyard like a ghost with a bad sense of direction. I rose on my elbows and watched it and did not give chase. There is such a thing as letting your enemy exhaust itself on furniture. There is such a thing as sleeping while the city worries without you. I am learning that thing, which must mean something is wrong with me or something is right. The roof smelled of tar and apology. Sisu made the sound that means butter with jam in a dream. My wings lay heavy as loaves. I let the rain name the night and kept my own quiet.",

                              "content": "The sea around Helsinki talks louder in April, when the ice lets go and the gulls remember how to swear. I liked to sit on the lip of a drainpipe above a courtyard on Meritullinkatu and listen to all of it: trams singing their electric hymns, a flurry of Finnish popping up from the street like the sound of river stones, the slap of fish in the market. From that perch the city was a series of shining edges and tunnels. I could leap from gutter to gutter in three strides. If the wind was right, I could open my wings (thin as onion skin, light as milk foam, alright they rustled like page corners) and glide down to the tiles of the low roof next door.\n\nSisu would be waiting on the roof, whiskers forward, nose bright. He\u2019d gnaw a piece of rye crust with the seriousness of a professor and look up at me with that almost-smile you get when you\u2019re not an animal at all, but a friend who listens.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d he\u2019d say around the crumb. He said \u201cwell\u201d like a drum tapped once with a thumb. \u201cWhat did the wind tell you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat the ferries are sharpening their anchors and the market lady in the yellow cap is going to drop a whole basket of blueberries on the stone tomorrow,\u201d I told him that day. \u201cAnd that there\u2019s a storm coming that smells like new plastic.\u201d\n\nSisu\u2019s whiskers drooped at the word. Plastic. The gulls loved it, the humans loved it. It flapped. It shone. It filled the world like a shadow you could carry around. For us, it hissed. It strangled. The wind got caught in it and forgot its own name.\n\n\u201cHer?\u201d Sisu asked, ears flicking toward the harbor.\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d I pushed a pebble with my toe and felt the small engine of the city humming underneath. \u201cSaid she\u2019s building something, something with handles.\u201d\n\nSisu chewed, thinking. He had a little scar near his right eye from when we got too close to a cormorant and his second thought came too late. \u201cAava,\u201d he said, and there was a tiny scrape of tooth on crust that meant he was saying more than the name. \u201cKassinen. Bag-witch. Bag-queen. Bag\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cToo many bags,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAlways too many. Her house must sound like a thunderstorm, every hour of the day.\u201d\n\nIt was one thing for a human to carry a bag. Two, three even. Sometimes they needed it. But Aava Kassinen made a cult of plastic. She tamed the city\u2019s winds and made them pull her white, blue, yellow trophies into sails, into flags, into a thousand crackling kites so even the swans thought twice before flying past the Katajanokka jetty. Everyone knew of her. No one saw her unless they\u2019d already been wrapped and wriggling and lifted in the pale embrace of polyethylene.\n\nWe had seen the bottom of those bags, Sisu and I. We had felt the way light gets wrong inside the bag. The suffocation of sound. We knew there were stories of pixies who had floated off in those makeshift hot-air nothings and been found hanging from pines on Seurasaari, drained of their names. Aava Kassinen left a wake of them. Not dead. Just\u2014creased. Folded into another shape.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go have a look,\u201d I said. \u201cWhile the old caretaker naps.\u201d\n\nSisu finished the crust, wiped his paws like a strict aunt, and nodded. He wore his bravery under his fur like a ribbon he would never take off. I picked up my coil of thread, the coin that served as my mirror, the half-blue feather I had found under the tram stop sign. I tucked my wings closer (they\u2019d been stinging lately, a kind of pins-and-needles ache that made me itch to fold them under my shirt, made me itch in ways I didn\u2019t like to think about). We went down the drainpipe, a long slide past rust and the marks of a dozen winters, past old snow nestling in the elbows of elbows of the pipe, then out through the grill at the base and into the world.\n\nThe world smelled like coffee and herring and the particular metal of springtime. We crossed the courtyard under the bicycles asleep with their front wheels turned in upon themselves, slid through a crack below the wooden gate, and emerged into sunlight sharp enough to file teeth on. People walked past with their complicated boots, their dogs on twisty leads. A tram sighed and glided by, green as a pond. A boy above us dropped a stick that could have been a flagpole to me. I ducked and laughed.\n\n\u201cUnder-Espa?\u201d Sisu asked. \u201cThrough the tulips?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Then past the bandstand and down to the ferry pier. We\u2019ll catch the scent there.\u201d\n\nUnder-Espa was the underworld I knew best. People strolled with ice creams on the bright benches, and we moved below the lip of the path, slipping between tulip stems and trash bins, under the low bridge of a stroller and past three girls who sat on the grass and laughed. The grass hissed secrets. The pigeons, those grumpy sons of stone, walked like policemen and watched us with one eye, then the other. A paper bag blew past us, trying to look innocent, and Sisu spat at it.\n\nAt the bandstand, a busker with a red scarf drew a song out of a violin that made seagulls pause mid-curse. I stopped, wings pricking. There are notes that catch in the ribs like fishhooks and you have to let them do what they do, tug you a little. I hovered in the shade, watching the bow leap, the elbow rise and fall. Sisu waited a heartbeat, two, then tugged my trouser leg. He is patient with my love for big sounds. He has had to be.\n\nWe passed the statue of J. L. Runeberg looking at something only he could see, and then the air changed. The harbor announced itself with wet light and old rope. We came down to the edge of Kauppatori and the tents in their neat lines\u2014orange, white\u2014masted in a wind that tasted like fish scales and copper coins. A woman laughed and a clapper found a glass. The vendor with eyes like two coal buttons shouted \u201cPerunaa!\u201d\u2014potatoes\u2014and slapped the counter with his palm. The gulls called out their regular blasphemies.\n\nThere. That hiss. It wasn\u2019t the gulls. A scudding, skittering snare-drum noise of thin plastic rubbing thin plastic, of handles tying themselves into knots and untie and tie again. The bags were alive. Sometimes in a city like this everything is a little alive; a bench can get bored, a door can sulk. The bags didn\u2019t feel like that. They felt like they were rehearsing someone else\u2019s breath.\n\nSisu smelled it too. The fur on his back lifted in a little tide. He craned his head toward the ferry pier.\n\nWe waited until three schoolchildren passed, knapsacks thumping their backs, a herd of busy calves, then slid in the wake of a dolly stacked with crates of pickled herring and jumped aboard the ferry just as the ramp shrieked and hauled up. The humans filed onto benches and rubbed their hands. I found a corner behind a life ring where the wind made a small steady hand that stroked my hair. Sisu tucked himself under my arm and peered out like a ticket inspector.\n\nThe city softened. The ferry made that smooth, persistent noise, half a purr and half a yawn, and the buildings along the shore\u2014pale yellow, white, rust\u2014sorted themselves out like guests at a Christmas party. We slid past the mounds of ice that had not got the memo, past a swan who held his own reflection like a secret. I watched the sea. I watched everything. Sisu counted pylons. I counted gulls with one wing patch darker than the rest.\n\nWhen we were halfway to Suomenlinna, it hit us. The air changed in a way I feel first in my gums and the long bones of my fingers. Cold was in it but also friction, like a small, constant rubbing, the distant sigh of something about to stick and hold. There\u2019s a skin you can throw over a place, if you are the type of person to do that, a skin that looks transparent but forces everything underneath to breathe wrong. We were inside some kind of dome.\n\nSisu pressed his whiskers against his forepaws and spoke into them like a microphone. \u201cIivari,\u201d he said (only Sisu calls me by my full name except when it\u2019s formal, except when the whole of Under-Espa calls me Little Iiv, but Sisu calls me Iivari, which means he is scolding me), \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t. We should ride on to the island and then come back again and go eat that piece of pulla the baker dropped and I hid under the bench by the tram stop and then nap. We should definitely nap.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t always,\u201d I said. \u201cBut sometimes we should. This might be sometimes.\u201d\n\nHe went still. Sisu has a stillness like a cat about to do something illegal. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the first sign of\u2014of suffocation\u2014I bite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s plastic you can\u2019t bite your way out of it,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll use the pin instead.\u201d\n\nI showed him the pin, silver, handsome, salvaged from the wide world and loved into my pocket. It had saved us before. It was not a hero\u2019s sword, but then I have never been the sword type. Pins, threads, buttons, coins\u2014that was my kind of hoard.\n\nWe came up under the rail as the ferry took the last curve. The island rose green and military. The old ramps, the stone walls, the roofs that have seen everything, even Sweden looking coldly down its nose. The ferry nosed up and kissed the dock. The ramp rattled down. The dome of plastic breath got tighter.\n\nWe disembarked with the baskets and the children and the two grandmothers arguing about nothing in particular. We slid into the shadows, down the small ditch where the island keeps its grudges, and waited for a dog with a yellow bandanna to be distracted by a smell. Then we moved toward the dry dock, toward the sound.\n\nIt was a whole chorus by then. Even Sisu, who can ignore almost anything if there is pastry involved, set his shoulders. The plastic whispered around us. It had the crinkle-purr of a candy wrapper just about to announce itself, the stick-slap of tape, the hush. We came to the mouth of the dry dock and looked down.\n\nAava Kassinen did not make a house; she made a nest in the way some people wear their secrets as clothing. The nest was extruded from a hundred, a thousand bags: corner store white, bold department store red, the pale translucent blue that is not a color so much as a memory of sky. She had fastened them by their handles into chains and those chains into ropes, and those ropes into cables that fanned out in a kind of horrible canopy that made the air more like a bag than air. The canopy went high, almost to the lip of the dock, and under it the bags made tents, tunnels, satin-veils. The whole thing breathed. It rose and fell, so slowly you would think you imagined it, like someone dreaming.\n\nShe moved inside it like a weather event. You looked and thought she was a plastic bag herself, then you saw the angles: the sharpness of cheekbones; the glossy hair that wasn\u2019t hair but strips braided from the plastic itself; the hands that were bare, red with the cold, nimble beyond comfort. Aava had made herself a garment of handles. They flapped and teased the wind, and they made a sound like applause when she raised her arms.\n\n\u201cWhy so many?\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhy so many when one will do?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the bags,\u201d Sisu said. \u201cIt\u2019s the noise. She has a whole orchestra and it only plays one song. She must sleep better inside it.\u201d\n\nEveryone thinks the villains sleep badly. I am not so sure. If your badness irons everything flat for you\u2014if you know how to fold away doubt\u2014you might sleep like a rock.\n\nWe slipped along the lip of the dock, alert as thread pulled tight. The plastic hissed above and below. There were other pixies here, I saw. Not many, because who would stay, but a few in gleams of blue and green, names folded under their tongues. They were helping her knot a rope that could pull the wind itself. Their faces were street-stone pale. They had a tiredness like scuff marks. When they looked up you could see the plastic in their pupils, that glint, the way the world got slicker. It is hard to resist slickness. I have failed to resist less.\n\nSisu\u2019s paw on my sleeve. He gestured with his chin. She had company.\n\nOn a low crate near the center of the nest sat a boy, nine or ten, his shoes muddy and his hair doing that summer cowlick thing despite it being spring. He held a paper cup he didn\u2019t drink from. He watched Aava knot. He didn\u2019t look scared. He looked like someone who found the perfect hiding place and is thinking, this will be my place now. Aava spoke to him without looking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a ship,\u201d she said. \u201cMy first was a kite. Then a sail. This is almost a ship. See. Feel it. The wind doesn\u2019t fight me. It gives. The wind wants it. The wind is nothing but an old friend who forgot its own face. It does not want to choose a direction. It wants to be carried.\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded because she was beautiful, and her voice could make the chips on a white plate sit up and listen, and he was a boy with spring in his soles and he had met somebody who said the word friend when meaning the wind. If she had asked him to fetch five hundred more bags, he would have run all the way back to the city with a grin and not felt the ache.\n\nI swallowed. \u201cShe\u2019s making a ship,\u201d I said. \u201cAn airship. She\u2019s going to climb the air like a staircase.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been doing it for years,\u201d Sisu said. \u201cWhy do you think the gulls look so tired? Why do you think the night has that squeak under it, like a cupboard that needs oiling? Why do you think you keep waking with your tongue stuck to the roof of your mouth, little Iiv? There\u2019s plastic in the air the way there\u2019s salt on the rocks. Of course it makes ships. You can make anything if you don\u2019t care who breathes it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me little,\u201d I said on reflex. I am not as tall as the tallest dandelion, but that is not the point. \u201cWe have to do something.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. He had wrapped his tail around my wrist without either of us noticing. It was a habit he had when the ground started to feel untrustworthy. \u201cWe can cut the knots,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe can saw the ropes. The wind will do the rest for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the pin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have teeth.\u201d\n\nHe grinned and I did too. We slid down a rusted chain, dropped into the shadow that pooled under an overhanging bit of stone, patterned with lichens like tiny continents. The air inside the nest had a high tone, like glass singing if you lick your finger and circle it. The tone made my elbows feel hollow. The bags brushed our ears. Everywhere you moved, a ghost of sound. It was like being inside breath itself.\n\nWe got to work. When you are small, attentions are your weapons. We found the second rope, not the first. You never cut the first; you always cut the second and the fourth and the ninth. We found the places where the handles had stretched thin and made a careful hole, then another, then we teased at the knot until the knot forgot what it was and became string again. That rope laughed itself loose across our shoulders and we lay under the laugh and tried not to. We moved to the next.\n\nSisu would do this thing with his paws when he concentrated, turning his wrists the smallest amount, as if he were tightening screws. He had this soft steady patience that made the world come right around him. He could chew through the tooth of a comb in five minutes, but he would not, because I had said I liked that comb. That\u2019s the kind of friend he is. I matched my breath to his (sloppy, my breath, more like a fountain than a metronome, but I try). We worked as if the city had been made for us to fix.\n\n\u201cYou know what they call her?\u201d I whispered as we moved. \u201cIn the old tunnels? Muovi-morsian. Plastic bride. Bride of the wind.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is married to her own noise,\u201d Sisu said. \u201cDon\u2019t give her the wind. The wind is too old for her. The wind has seen more lovers than we have words for snow.\u201d\n\nWe cut the third rope. We were reaching for the fourth when the boy laughed.\n\n\u201cYou have a tail,\u201d he said.\n\nWe froze.\n\nHe was looking right at us, but not exactly, the way a human looks at you when you are almost small enough to belong to another world. His smile was neat, sly, an echo of someone else\u2019s grin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thread,\u201d Aava said, not looking up from her knot. \u201cEverything has a tail today. Everything trails. Don\u2019t you see? That\u2019s the point.\u201d But there was a new edge to her song.\n\nThe boy pointed. I felt Sisu stiffen. I could smell the sweetness of his fear, the way you smell apple cores in the trash. If the boy reached, and Aava followed his finger, and she looked with the eyes she had for prey\u2014\n\nI did not think. I ran. I ran the way a leaf runs on the surface of water when a fish kisses it from below. We flattened ourselves beneath the mutual breaths of a thousand bags. We took the hidings that the ropes offered. We became shadow where shadow had finished. I put my palm on Sisu\u2019s skull and felt how thin bone is, felt the hum of his small, furious life. I said a word I knew. It was a sort of word you learn under benches, not the kind they put in poems.\n\nAava stopped tying knots.\n\n\u201cBirds get caught in here sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cButterflies. Once a bat. Do you know what you do when a bat panics? You sing. It will catch onto your voice like a climber catches a rope.\u201d Her voice rose and fell like the sea when it\u2019s thinking of a tantrum. \u201cCome out then. Come out. We are not cruel. We are\u2014especially to little ones\u2014merciful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIivari,\u201d Sisu whispered. \u201cShe has the kind of mercy that looks like a bag with a smile printed on it.\u201d\n\nI made a face that meant I agreed and that we needed to move. To the left, then. To the sag at the seam where the big blue bag from the grocery store met the thin sheer ghost of the pharmacy bag, where the knot had been tied by a distracted hand. If we could get there, we could slip out and under the plank and then\u2014\n\nA hand dropped, sudden as a trap door. It was not Aava\u2019s. It was the boy\u2019s. Quick. Curious. Not as strong as it thought it was.\n\nIt closed around my middle.\n\nI am not made for squeezing. My insides are correct only when they feel a certain completeness of space, a certain arrangement\u2014you could call it a nest. That hand stole all the air from me and then gave it back in a way that made each rib count itself, embarrassed to be so few. My eyes watered. My wings writhed against his palm and found nothing to push with. For a breath, two, the world went vertical and the bags around me were big as sails and kissed with a hundred prints of long-dead store names. Sisu\u2019s nose\u2014Sisu\u2019s whole self\u2014disappeared behind a sheet of transparent nothing.\n\n\u201cGot one,\u201d the boy said. Gleeful. \u201cIt\u2019s all bones.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all not yours,\u201d Aava said, but she didn\u2019t say it with much sadness. She said it like there was a point coming and I was the point. She rose, all the handles-hours of her dress rising too, and came toward us. Her eyes were gray like the sea thinks it is when it has no imagination. Her mouth made a small appreciative O when she saw me.\n\n\u201cWell, little,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIivari,\u201d I said because names matter and because I had breath again. \u201cFrom\u2014Helsinki. From here. From there.\u201d\n\nShe made a pleased sound, a coin on a plate. \u201cA town pixie,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought they were finished. But they never are. Nothing is ever finished in a city. It is only covered.\u201d\n\nSisu had become an outline under the plastic, a scribble with ears. He pushed and pushed, and the plastic bent and did not break. He bit, and the plastic tasted like water and refusal.\n\nI looked at the boy. He had something in his face I wanted to like. A softness that sat in the wrong place, maybe. He looked like he sneaked out of school to draw pictures of boats because he knew the math of sails without knowing he knew it. He would have been mine, once, if I had caught him first. He would have followed me to the roof and listened to the wind and asked what it said in the mornings before the city woke up. I said to him, \u201cI bite.\u201d\n\nHe grinned, startled and delighted, and loosened his hand to see if it was true.\n\nI bit. It is not noble. It is what you do when someone puts their life around yours and squeezes.\n\nHe yelped. Aava laughed, brief and bright. I was already falling. The plastic met me like a hug you want; then it turned. It slipped. The nest had its habits and one of them was to catch anything that fell. I slid between brands. I slid across borders. I slid into a tunnel whose walls smelled like bread, medicine, cigarettes, fish, factory, rain. Sisu was at the bottom, paws stretched, eyes wider than winter.\n\n\u201cAre you bleeding?\u201d he asked. It came out thin because the plastic ate half of the word.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cNo. Not in the way that counts. Run.\u201d\n\nWe ran. The tunnel was a throat that led to a mouth in the wood of the dock, the place where the plank did not quite meet the post. The light beyond it was honest. The light did not taste like a factory. We clawed toward it. The sound of our own bodies was the sound the bags wanted. They grew louder. They tried to be us. We hit the light and then dirt and then the good rough edges of old stone.\n\nBehind us, Aava\u2019s laugh skittered along the ground and tried to borrow my spine. \u201cCome again, little Iivari,\u201d she said, and I could hear how she was making my name into a handle. \u201cBring your friend. We have songs you will like. We have ways of breathing you do not know yet.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t stop until the ferry pulled away, smaller and smelling like a lie. We didn\u2019t stop until we were on the mainland and the gulls felt like someone else\u2019s problem. We didn\u2019t stop until we slid under the bench by the tram stop where Sisu had hid a lump of sugared pulla beneath a napkin someone had mistaken for a cloud. We ate\u2014the sugar stuck in our mouths in a way that felt like the plastic felt on the island, and I made a face\u2014and then lay on our backs and stared at the underside of the city.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not all right,\u201d Sisu said eventually. He doesn\u2019t say things like that unless he knows he can be useful afterward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d I started, and then my wings laid their hands on my shoulder blades in that pins-and-needles way again. There was a weight to them I had not known before, like wet leaves. \u201cShe\u2019s building a ship.\u201d It seemed the only useful thing to say. \u201cA ship that will blot out the tram lines. A ship that will make the sky into a bag. She\u2019ll pull the wind in and the wind won\u2019t remember its name.\u201d\n\nSisu turned a crumb in his paws. He didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cWe can cut knots,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can cut until our cuts connect. We can tell the older pixies. We can talk to the ones under the bridges, the ones who tie tin-foil streamers to iron and call it a ritual. We can visit the ferry man who feeds us sometimes and pretend not to. We can chew through the cords of her drying lines. We can ask the storm crows for a favor. We can sit on the lip of the drainpipe and wait for her ship to go up, then pull.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot,\u201d I said (half of me said) and \u201cWe must\u201d (another half of me said), \u201clet her take the boy.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged with his undignified honesty. \u201cYou will tell me not to bite children,\u201d he said. \u201cYou always do. But you want to. It\u2019s in your eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to bite anyone,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to show him the wind the way it is by itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if he thinks that\u2019s boring?\u201d\n\nHe looked away and I looked at his ear and thought about how easily plastic remembers the shape of a body that leans on it. Sisu yawned in the ancient way of his kind, long and head-tipped, stretching his teeth to the measure of his life. He put his head on my hip. \u201cYou need to sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cYou rattle. You\u2019ll rattle yourself apart.\u201d\n\nI yawned too, because we are ridiculous when we love someone. I lay and listened to the tram. I let the scuffed underside of the bench watch over me. Somewhere a bag snagged on a branch and tried to become a flag, then gave up and became a noise. I slept.\n\nI dreamed in plastic. In the dream, the city was a bottle. I was walking along the rim. Sisu was below, in the thread that wrapped the bottle, pacing, reading a story in the weave. Aava walked above me, upside down, as if the sky had gravity for her alone. The boy was a shadow behind her. I shouted and got a handful of my own echo. I jumped and my wings caught and carried and then didn\u2019t. I fell and it did not hurt, because in dreams the ground is an idea and you can argue with it. I woke to Sisu\u2019s paw on my forehead, light as the idea of rain.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s at the drain,\u201d he said.\n\nWe went still. We listened.\n\nFootsteps in the courtyard above. A voice we knew threaded through them, the old caretaker humming. Snow melts and reveals the old world\u2019s secrets: bottles half-buried in the ground, a spoon that fell where a hand couldn\u2019t reach, a single mitten hardened like a shell. Spring reveals other things too. We watched the sliver of light. We watched for the shadow of boots.\n\nThey came. The caretaker\u2019s boots framed the crack. He bent. In his hands, a loop of blue plastic went from circle to knot to uselessness, tightened to strain his fingers, then loosened again. I could see his concentration in the way his tongue touched a tooth. He muttered something that could have been a spell and was likely \u201cwhere did I put that thing.\u201d He threaded the loop through the gate latch and pulled and set the knot, proud of his work.\n\nI held my breath. Not because of the gate or the knot, but because of the way his hand held the loop. It looked like a noose for something not human. It looked like a way the city taught itself tricks. I felt the rough of the bench under my back as if it had hands. Sisu\u2019s tail tightened around my wrist.\n\nThe caretaker straightened. He kicked a pile of leaves half-heartedly with the toe of his boot. Something scurried. He made a little Ehh noise and laughed at himself. He turned and went away across the yard, whistling like a kettle getting going.\n\n\u201cHe is nothing,\u201d Sisu said.\n\n\u201cHe is nothing,\u201d I echoed. \u201cHe is everything. He locks gates so we have to take the long way.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe brave in small things,\u201d Sisu said gently. He nibbled at my sleeve, making it tidy. \u201cAnd in big things if you must. But you should eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you ate was plastic flavored sugar. That\u2019s not eating. That\u2019s memory of eating.\u201d\n\nSo we ate, again, in the irregular way we\u2019ve always had: pieces of a pretzel knot, a dot of butter scraped from the lip of a take-away box, lentils someone had dropped like a blessing. I licked the salt off my fingers and it tasted of coins and rain. I felt steadier. Small animals should not be hungry. They come undone then. I am not a small animal. But I forget to eat.\n\nWhen the light had folded itself into the windows like napkins, we went up to the roof. It is my favorite hour. The tram lights draw a necklace around the city. The gulls give up their insults and practice embarrassment in a quieter voice. A dog barks and then doesn\u2019t. Someone turns on a radio and you find yourself borrowing a moment of their sadness and thinking it\u2019s yours, then giving it back without being rude. Sisu sat with his forepaws tucked, a perfect loaf. I sat with my legs out and my wings fighting with the thought of being wings. The air was thin and not thin, exactly right for telling secrets to.\n\n\u201cPromise me something,\u201d I said.\n\nHe told me with the small tilt of his head to go on.\n\n\u201cIf the wind goes into a bag,\u201d I said. \u201cIf she pulls it in and it forgets itself. If I get caught and don\u2019t get short of breath the way I should, if I think the plastic is a wall of music. If I smile without meaning to. If I start to like the way it squeaks.\u201d I swallowed, and even the swallow squeaked in my mind. \u201cYou must be worse than me. Not better. Worse. Bite. Bite me if you have to. Hard.\u201d\n\nSisu looked at the tram lights. \u201cWe don\u2019t bite the ones we love,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cExcept to remind them.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\nHe sighed. It made his whole body become a hand opening. He put his paw on my knee. \u201cI will remind you,\u201d he said.\n\nWe listened to the city think. We listened to the water holding and letting go and holding again at the edge of the day. Somewhere down on the street, a girl ran and laughed; that laugh rose and caught on the lip of the roof and stayed for a moment near us like a moth. I folded my wings. They crackled like paper. My shoulder blades hurt as though something inside me was trying to remember a different shape.\n\n\u201cYou were almost caught,\u201d Sisu said into the silence. \u201cDo you want to tell someone?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cNo.\u201d There was a patch of tar on the roof that looked like a lion if you tilted your head. I tilted mine. It did not help. \u201cIf I tell, they will say what you said. Cut knots. Tell the ferry man. The ritual bridges. The storm crows. They will make committees. They will write songs about scissors. And the boy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014will be a boy. He will be a boy that fills his pockets with rocks and keeps going. We cannot cut the pockets out of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can warn him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot. You do not speak boy. He hears you as noise. As plastic. As something to be handled. He does not think there is a tiny city under the city he lives in. He thinks there is only his own feet and the places they can go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can be loud.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will scare him and then he will be grateful for the one who tells him there is nothing to be scared of. You will make Aava\u2019s voice make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I bite him?\u201d\n\nSisu did not dignify that with an answer. I laughed, but it came out like a cough. The humor of being a person who cannot be seen by most people is not really humor. It\u2019s a trick your ribs play on you so you can do your next thing.\n\n\u201cSleep,\u201d Sisu said. \u201cTomorrow we go to the bridges. We make the choir of scissors. We bring them to the dock at dusk. We sing, we cut, we pull. We scatter her ship like the gulls scatter chips. For now, sleep. Please. Please, little Iiv.\u201d\n\nI slept. I dreamt a different dream\u2014the old one where the tram stops and everyone on it turns their heads toward me at once because they can see. It is a bad dream for me because the faces have something of the kind killer in them. And there is also the cat. There is always also the cat. In the dream it doesn\u2019t pounce. It waits, patient, as if it knows it will always have time.\n\nMorning came in the way it does here, gray and then suddenly ridiculous with light. We were up before there were whistles. We went down into the belly of the city, into the places where tin meets water and the sound likes to fold itself and sit still. The others were there: S\u00e1ga with her hair like copper wire you could fix a radio with; old Totti with his scarf tied the wrong way around; a girl who called herself Kaarna because she loved the word for bark, not the sound a dog makes, the skin of a tree. They had brought thread and pins and those scissors that you can\u2019t open all the way if you are small but you can move and make sing anyway.\n\n\u201cWe cut at dusk,\u201d S\u00e1ga said in a voice like a sock you do not throw away. \u201cWhen the wind thinks about tiredness but has not made any decisions yet. She will lift; we cut. The wind will be guilty. It will drop her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will not,\u201d Totti said flatly. \u201cThe wind is old. It leaves guilt to others. It will go on. It is what it does.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine. We will be guilty then. But I prefer others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cut,\u201d Kaarna said. \u201cThat is what we do. We are not judges. We are scissors.\u201d\n\nThey looked at me. In the community under the benches, under the bridges, inside the trams with the dust, there are no leaders, not really, but there are those with louder stories at any given moment, and I had the boy in mine. I could feel them asking, Iivari, is this story necessary? Is it yours? Are you making it bigger because you like big things?\n\n\u201cShe will raise a ship that wraps half the sky,\u201d I said. \u201cShe wants it to curl over our roofs like a wave and stay. We will wake to everything a little softer. Softer is not our style. We are hard like bread. We are sharp like wind. We are not meant to breathe someone else\u2019s breath.\u201d\n\nThey nodded. Words can make small hard things stand up with you for a while. We set the time. We made a little pile of pins so they would feel like comrades. We ate the last of Totti\u2019s dried berry thing that tasted like memory of summer and shoe leather. We waited.\n\nIt rained and stopped. It hailed a little, tiny glass beads the gulls were offended by. The harbor sounded like itself. A woman near the fish stall said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d and then bought it anyway. A man yelled \u201cTwo euros,\u201d as if that were a punchline. We stole a paper napkin and folded it into a boat and set it to sail in a gutter. We watched it go under a car and come out the other side as if it had learned something you can only learn under a car. It had. It had learned to be darker. That was all.\n\nAt dusk, we went.\n\nWe were not the only ones arming ourselves with small sharpness. Oma Hilma, who sells berries and speaks to the ravens in a language that makes them look embarrassed, had tucked a bread knife into her apron strings. The ferry man had a folding knife in his pocket where no one would bother him for it. The boy? He brought what boys bring: faith.\n\nWe slid along the dock. We found the rusted chain. We left our careful footprints (I am too vain about this: my footprints are nothing, but I like them). We reached the lip of the dry dock and the nest of breath.\n\nIt had grown. It had become a mouth talking to the sky. It had become brave. The bags were taut and full. They were ready. Aava stood in the center, and the boy beside her, and the other pixies with their slick eyes, and for a second I thought I did see a bat caught and nicely soothed and pale with sleep inside a white bag near the top of the structure. Maybe she did have mercy. Maybe her mercy and mine only wore different shoes.\n\nThe wind came like a childhood friend who\u2019d been bragging in other towns and came home to prove it. It put both hands on the nest and lifted. The nest answered yes. The ropes went from lines to songs. Aava\u2019s hair, her plastic hair, snapped and snapped and then learned a different tune and lay obedient.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d S\u00e1ga said. \u201cNow.\u201d\n\nWe moved like ants with knives. We went for the second rope\u2014the fourth\u2014the ninth. We went for the places where the handles had been worried by frost. We went for the knots made with cold hands. We cut. We cut like a lullaby you sing to put a monster to sleep. We cut, and the monster laughed, because laughter and crying look the same from inside a bag.\n\nUp above, Aava swayed. She threw her arms as if she were a conductor and the orchestra was the plastic and the air. The boy held on to a handle. He laughed. It got into my bones. I looked at him and I did the wrong thing. I wished for a second that I were big. Big enough to take his hand. Big enough to put him behind me and use all the words I have that keep monsters off, which is a dozen, which is none at all when the monster uses the words themselves as handles. Big. Big. Big as a gull.\n\n\u201cIivari,\u201d Sisu said sharply. \u201cYou\u2019re not biting. It\u2019s worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cCut,\u201d I said. \u201cCut.\u201d\n\nWe did. The second rope sighed and slipped. The fourth let go and there was a change in the nest, a tilt like a thought that has decided to be done with a conversation. The ninth, oh, the ninth was stubborn. Kaarna sang to it, quiet under the din, a song with a bark in it, and the rope remembered it was only rope and slackened.\n\nThe nest shuddered.\n\nAava faltered for the first time. She looked down. She saw us. She saw the glitter of pins. She saw Sisu (how can you be so handsome when you are scared, I wanted to ask later) braced with all four paws, tail around my wrist, teeth in a handle. She looked at me as if she could remember every face she had ever loved and knew what this face was.\n\n\u201cNot tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cSurely you can see\u2014this is bigger than\u2014\u201d\n\nI do not like when people say bigger. I cut the sentence instead.\n\nEverything went wrong with grace. The nest did not collapse. It sighed and reared. A hundred bags let go of other bags like friendships end, not with a word but a slackness. The whole thing rose and rolled and tipped and\u2014my heart could not keep up with it. There are changes so large that your small muscle cannot catch them all. The boy slipped. His hand came off the handle. He pinwheeled, a small human windmill, laughing still with his mouth and forgetting to with his eyes.\n\nI ran for him. My wings gave me a fist of lift. Two fists. Not enough. Idiot wings. I leaped. Sisu leaped between me and the ground and did a thing I have seen him do when he would catch crumbs: he made himself the shape the world wanted and the world put the crumb in him.\n\nHe caught the boy.\n\nHe caught the boy\u2019s sleeve, which was a universe to him, and he made his body into resistance. The boy\u2019s laugh popped like a bubble. He made a sound exactly like when a person flips a coin and it doesn\u2019t flip and they have to pretend they meant it. He looked down and saw me and Sisu and that we were not nothing.\n\nAava moved with the speed of someone who has braided her life into ropes. She reached, caught, hauled, wrapped. The boy rose again, angles went wrong, came right. He was back inside the breath of plastic, the canopy, the waterless water. He held a handle again. He didn\u2019t laugh. He didn\u2019t cry. He put his head against the bag nearest his cheek and it cupped him back the way a hand does a pet.\n\nWe lay panting. We are small. Breathing is a whole job. I lay and watched the nest steady. I watched the ropes ask what had just happened. I watched the wind decide to keep being itself anyway. Sisu put his paw on my shoulder. He was shaking the way a tram shakes at a turn. He said the word he always says when the world decides it will keep going.\n\n\u201cEat.\u201d\n\nI swallowed the word. There was nothing in my mouth but the taste of the boy\u2019s sleeve and the high-tin taste of the pin and my own blood a little. I could fit ten pains in my chest. I could fit a whole harbor in my chest. Neither of those facts were useful. I didn\u2019t care. I carried them anyway.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d S\u00e1ga said down the rope. \u201cAgain. Again.\u201d\n\nWe cut. We cut as if to put out a fire: not to stop everything but to change the order of it. The ropes recalcified. The nest leaned\u2014I imagined it. I spoke to the bag nearest me and it ignored me which is all you can ask of plastic. The gulls had come to watch. One dropped a clam and missed the rocks. The clam thought about its god.\n\nAnd then the wind changed.\n\nIt does that. It owed us nothing. It had been lifting from the west and then it came from the north, and the breath inside the nest had to relearn itself. For a moment, the whole work trembled in its making, like a baby thinking about crying then deciding the ceiling is interesting. In that moment, Kaarna\u2019s bark-song became a growl. Totti did something clever with his scarf and a rusty hook. Sisu did not let go of my wrist. Aava did not let go of her dream. The boy looked at me and did this thing that boys do when the world opens: he winked. Idiot. Brave. The most annoying kind of brave.\n\nI think if the tram had passed then, if a single passenger had looked out the window at the dry dock, if a radio had gone quiet at the right moment, if Oma Hilma had taken her knife from her apron and whistled, if a cat had sneezed, we would have cut the ship from the sky and it would have gone up anyway because a thousand cuts do not always make a fall. Things hang on. That is what they do.\n\nBut none of those happened. The wind did what it wanted. The nest rose and this time it went not up, but out, a huge slow rolling like the breath of a sleeping wall. The ropes went taut and stayed there. We cut and cut and the cuts made small white smiles and the smiles closed because plastic does not like to be reminded of mouth. The ship\u2014which was not a ship but something that wanted to be a mouth, perhaps\u2014shuddered and found itself.\n\nAava raised her hands. The handles in her dress clapped. The boy held on. The ship slid toward the harbor-light and away from us. We had not stopped a thing. We had not made a start. We had merely shown up with our little hunger for the world to be correct. Often, that is not enough.\n\nWe lay there and watched. Sisu\u2019s breath came in hiccups. He tucked his head into my side and made a small high-live noise that means please, for a moment, make the world smaller. I put my hand on his head. I told my wing to be quiet. It shuffled like pages. We watched.\n\n\u201cI will\u2014\u201d I said, then stopped.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d he said automatically. \u201cSleep. Bite. Cut. Repeat.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014I will go to the boy,\u201d I said. \u201cI will not talk. I will be in his shoe. I will be in his pockets. I will put an idea in him that is not a knife. I will make him love the sound of wind through birch leaves more than the sound of plastic. I will make him love the pause between gull curses. I will make him love his breath outside anything but his own chest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already there,\u201d Sisu said without opening his eyes. \u201cYou are all over this city like a rumor. You\u2019re under his feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop being wise,\u201d I said sharply. \u201cIt confuses me.\u201d\n\nHe smiled into my side. I touched his ear. It was cold and thin and filled with listening. I put my mouth near it and said, very quietly, \u201cThank you for catching him.\u201d\n\nSisu\u2019s smile shifted. \u201cOf course. You would have been unbearable if he had fallen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are unbearable as it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try harder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always try. That is your trouble.\u201d\n\nThe ship moved until we couldn\u2019t hear its breath anymore. The harbor settled. The plastic in the city went on doing what plastic does: soften, shine, repeat. The trams sang. The city was itself. We were two small beings under it and we had done something that was not enough and we were going to do it again. I closed my eyes. I let sleep come like a bag I could refuse, but didn\u2019t, this one time. I let the wind go through me. I let my wings be heavy. I let the city carry me a little and believed that was all right.\n\nWe slept badly.\n\nIn the morning I woke with my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth, not because of plastic, I told myself, because of sugar and fear. I woke to Sisu chewing on nothing, the way he does when he practices chewing just in case. I woke to a sound near the gutter that was not our sound.\n\nA plastic bag had found its way to our drainpipe. It clung there, a jellyfish, pulsing. It had writing on it in a language I could not read. It had one handle torn. It had the stubborn look of a tourist who will not ask for directions. The wind plucked it and plucked it again, and it held.\n\nI watched it and thought of Aava Kassinen and her dress and her hands and the boy\u2019s sleeve. I thought of the way my wings had not carried me and how their weight felt like a promise nobody asked me to keep. I thought about the cat. I thought, too, about a part of myself that had nothing to do with wings, that knew the feel of wood fibers under teeth, that could hear a splitting grain from three rooms away. I put my hand over my mouth so Sisu would not see my first thought.\n\nThen I got up.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d Sisu said without opening his eyes.\n\n\u201cAfter,\u201d I said. I climbed the pipe. Not with wings. With ten little habits of grip. The bag watched me with the face of a thing about to become smaller. I reached it. I put my palm on it. I felt the slick cool. I whispered into it with my breath, and what I said was not any kind of magic. It was a list: trams, gulls, old salt, rye bread, morning fog, coffee steam, pavement grit, first snow, last snow, bikes that do not rattle when they should. I put all of that into the bag and I made it so that, for a second, it remembered: it had come from somewhere else and it had been something else and it did not need to be here anymore.\n\nThe bag let go.\n\nI am not Aava. My hands shook. I climbed down. Sisu was awake and pretending not to be worried. He sighed. \u201cEat,\u201d he said.\n\nWe ate. We sat. We watched the city go about its large chore. We made plans with string and pins. We told ourselves the boy would be all right because we needed to. We told ourselves the wind would remember its own name. We told ourselves we were big enough to do something. We told ourselves the story about the pixie and the mouse who did not stop until the city remembered what its breath felt like.\n\nUnder all that, something else spoke, a little voice like a seed under the soil, and I did not listen to it. Not yet. Not then. If I had listened then, if I had put my ear to the wood of the bench and heard the rumor of the truth that had carried me this far\u2014what kind of story would this be?\n\nSo let it be this: we got up, we took our small weapons, and we went to work. The day cracked its knuckles. The harbor pretended indifference. A gull landed beside us, cocked its head, and screamed the way they scream when they are not screaming at anything. Sisu screamed back, because he is ridiculous. I laughed. He laughed. The city felt, for a breath, correct.\n\nAnd somewhere above, the ship made of too much lifted and tilted and waited for us to be ready to cut it into a sky again.",

                              "content": "We started with the bridges because bridges remember. They are the spines of the city, and spines hold grudges and grace with the same stubbornness. We went to Pitk\u00e4silta first, because everyone goes there first when they mean business. The long bridge stretched itself like an old soldier and pretended not to listen while we slipped into the underspace where iron sweats and pigeons give speeches. S\u00e1ga had come already and chalked a circle on the moss-dark stone, a tiny parliament. Totti arrived late, shaking rain from his scarf and scolding the droplets as if they were nephews. Kaarna brought the tinfoil streamers that the bridge-folk love, strips of moon that you can tie to anything you hope will keep you.\n\nThe bridge pixies were there in the places you only see when you are so tired your eyes look for places to sit down. They climbed out from between bolts and washers, out of cracks that looked like dried smiles, out from behind the great iron ribs, dusty as long coats. They had the glance of people who live always under something that can fall and choose to take pride in that. They looked at our pins like a choir sizing up new scores.\n\n\u201cWe need a sound,\u201d S\u00e1ga said, turning her copper-wire hair into a rope with her fingers as she spoke. \u201cNot just cutting. Cutting is a rhythm, yes, but we need dissonance too. The bags like harmony. They like sameness. We need to bring a quarrel to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bridge can quarrel,\u201d said a little man who called himself Valtteri and had the nose of a weathervane. \u201cPitk\u00e4silta knows how to argue. Ask anyone. Half the city once stood on this side, and half on that, and they threw songs and stones at each other and called it politics. I will give you a bend in the wind. I will give you a draft that cannot make up its mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Totti said, and the word fell with a clack. \u201cTie your tin then. Make it bicker.\u201d\n\nWe wove tinfoil into cheap magic. We tied streamers to the low guts of the bridge where shoes cannot see, where mice courts are held. We made the bridge tut at the wind, then coax, then snarl, then coo. We hung bottle-caps we had hammered flat so they would glitter with disdain. Kaarna lay on her back and sang to the bolts, a song like bark scraped with a knife to see what color is underneath. The bridge shivered and then settled as if it remembered old winters. I pressed my cheek to a patch of iron that held the imprint of a human hand and said the only thing I know how to say to objects that bear weight: thank you, but in a tone that suggests I am not finished asking.\n\nWe went next to the little bridges, to the ones that think they are jokes and then become serious all at once when the river remembers who it is. We went to the wooden arch near T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 that smells like a drawer; to the low cement span that ducks its head under the tram rails near Hakaniemi, where the market voices blow through like leaves. Every bridge gave us a different way to argue. One gave us a sigh. One gave us a complaint that had not found words yet. One gave us a trick draft that tickles the ear and makes you turn when you meant to go straight. We tied, we sang, we swapped pins for bits of rust as if those were fair trades. By noon, the city had taken on a faint burr, a beautiful impatience. The wind in its throat had a new rasp.\n\n\u201cStorm crows,\u201d Sisu said, licking bridge grit from his paws as if it were sugar. \u201cWe promised them the first choice of fish guts for a week.\u201d\n\nWe crossed the city by riding the shadows of trousers like ferries and hitching a lift on the cuff of a lady who had sewn three loose buttons to keep from thinking about her husband. At the tram stop the busker with the red scarf was already playing, and the violin threw lines up into the morning, bright threads that caught on the underside of clouds. I stopped there longer than I should have and the music did the thing it does to my wings, laid a heat there that did not ask permission. The notes walked along my ribs until my breath had to move aside and go elsewhere for a time. The busker glanced down and then back up, because sometimes we are nothing and sometimes we are a quiver in the corner of someone\u2019s eye and that is almost the same as a friend.\n\nWe found the footbridge to Seurasaari and did not use it. We went under, because we are loyal to our ways. The water held itself in a chill hand and let us step from root to rock to root as if it remembered we had given it something once. The island smelled of wet wood, old roast, burnt sugar, ash. The houses there keep the ghosts of every stove that ever cooked a summer stew. The crows were lined along the fence like punctuation. They watched us come up the path and pretended they were not waiting for an appointment.\n\n\u201cVaris-rouva,\u201d S\u00e1ga said, bowing with a flourish that would have torn a hole in a dress if she had been wearing one. \u201cQueen of quarrels. Collector of shiny lies. We come to ask for beaks.\u201d\n\nThe queen stepped forward, disgraceful in her beauty, one ragged primary feather like a scratch down her side. She considered us with the eye that makes you doubt your own name and then, as if she did not want to waste our time, spoke. Her voice had road in it. It had trash fire. It had fish scales, always fish scales.\n\n\u201cYou eat your bread,\u201d she said. \u201cWe eat your crowns. You cut your knots. We pull at your sleeves. You come because the big white that pretends to be sky is full of food-smell and no food. You come because your little breaths stick to it and it makes you quiet. We don\u2019t like quiet. It\u2019s a trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will bring guts,\u201d Sisu said. He said the word with professional interest. \u201cAnd crisp edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cEdges,\u201d the queen croaked as if tasting. \u201cYou will bring the small sharp white that wraps the fish and we will break it with our feet. We will not be fooled by the fish that is not a fish. We will tear at the handles because the handles are the only part that admits to being a handle. We will fly where you cannot stand, and we will talk to the gulls because the gulls can be bribed. They love money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no money,\u201d Kaarna said, laughing under her breath.\n\n\u201cThat is why gulls love you,\u201d said the queen, and the crows all made that strangled bark that means they have found themselves funny. \u201cBring us the guts. Put them where the air tastes of iron and salt. We will meet you at the dock when the shadow of the cathedral lies like a folded shirt. Two of ours will go now, because they like the smell of trouble.\u201d\n\nTwo peeled from the fence with the casual arrogance that attends people with wings that work. One was as narrow as a ribbon, the other had a beak chipped like a broken tooth. They came to us, stepped, dignified, and the chipped one eyed Sisu as if he were a challenge handsome enough to take. Sisu did not flinch. He blinked slowly and tilted his head a degree. The crow made a sound that said acknowledgment without conceding anything.\n\n\u201cJaakko,\u201d said the ribbon-crow.\n\n\u201cK\u00e4ry,\u201d said the chipped. Smoke. He had the voice of a fire gone too quickly out.\n\n\u201cWe have a busker,\u201d I said before I could stop myself. \u201cHe might tune the air for you. He can tune anything. If we put his bow in your hearing, you will tear the right bit of wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cMusic,\u201d said Jaakko with the cautious contempt of someone who has been fooled by a flute once. \u201cFine. Bring it quick. The white is hungry.\u201d\n\nWe left the crows counting their bright things and went in search of human timing. The busker had moved to the far end of Esplanadi, under the little trees that scratch their names into the light. I stood close enough to see the thumbnail-sized callus on his left index finger and the burn scar on his right wrist that did not belong to a violinist but did belong to someone who makes soup. He had a jar with coins and a clover. I put my coin mirror near the clover, very close, so that when the jar moved there would be a small clink and he might think, what is that luck doing there.\n\nWe made ourselves large in the shape only we know how to make and he saw something like a ripple in the shade. His bow hesitated. He changed key. He shifted into a tune that had windows opening in it. Sisu flicked his tail in admiration. I leaned in and set my half-blue feather against the hair of the bow, not where it would tangle, just where it would ride. The feather knew the game and kept quiet.\n\nThe note that came next was not magic because it did not solve anything. It was better than that. It made the air complicated. It made the handles jolt a little where they thought they had settled into a pleasure. It put grit into plastic\u2019s morning. The busker frowned as if he had heard a door open that should have stayed shut. He played on, and we carried that new kink in the note with us like a seed we didn\u2019t know how to plant.\n\nWe took the ferry man our plan and our childishness. He was on his smoke break, which he had no intention of enjoying because the breeze would not commit. He had a kind look, that bad kind, the kind that makes you want to be good because someone expects it of you without saying it. He looked toward the dock with the way of someone who can measure distance in words. He already had a folding knife. He already had a pole with a hook. He did not need our advice. We gave it anyway because giving advice is a way to ask someone to see you.\n\n\u201cDelay,\u201d I said, and it came out a plea. \u201cJust a moment when a line cannot find its cleat and the gulls all decide to tell a joke at once. Make a human-shaped mistake. We will be in it.\u201d\n\nHe nodded once as if he had decided that grace can wear blue work trousers. He flicked his cigarette into the water and looked guilty in a theatrical way so the cormorant on the buoy would have something to judge him for. He didn\u2019t look at us when he said, \u201cA bag tried to have the propeller yesterday. We had to cut it free. It came up shining as if it had dreamed it was a jellyfish. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn the late afternoon we followed the smell of laundry that wasn\u2019t laundry to Katajanokka, to the alley where Aava Kassinen dries what she calls her silks. She had strung lines from downspout to lamp to chimney and the whole block wore her like a veil. The bags twitched when shadows crossed them. They made skins for the wind. Each one had a logo that once meant an errand. Together the logos made a language that wasn\u2019t a language but a pressure.\n\nWe went with the clumsy stealth of heroes and slipped under the hanging nothings. Sisu\u2019s whiskers wrote angry words in the air. Kaarna hummed to herself so softly you could pretend you couldn\u2019t hear. I took out the pin and chose a bag that said THANK YOU in eight languages and no apologies. I punctured the corner near the seam and the bag sighed and became less of itself. I felt it let go. It tried to pull me with it. I said all right, then, and stopped before I went lightheaded.\n\nThe creased ones found us. Not all of Aava\u2019s helpers are pixies. Some are what we become when we forget we are not laundry. A girl with a green ribbon that had once been more than plastic came around the corner with her eyes so clean it hurt. Behind her was a boy with palms shiny with handling. Their faces were that strange good: as if sleep had restored them, but only as far as the last fold. They stood, not blocking the path, but suggesting that the path had always been the other way.\n\n\u201cYou are very busy,\u201d the girl said, not unkind. \u201cYou will be tired by dusk.\u201d\n\n\u201cRest is for after,\u201d S\u00e1ga said, straightening a streamer. \u201cOr never. Either suits me.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d said the boy. His voice had a summer in it that this city only sometimes provides. \u201cIt\u2019s nicer in there. The sound is closer to the face. She will show you how to not mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mind,\u201d I said, and he did flinch at that, the smallest tilt of a leaf in wind. I took out my mirror coin and held it at my knee so it was not a threat. The coin showed him a crooked picture of himself, eye like a galaxy, mouth like a line drawn by a child who is not ashamed of his pencil. I have done this before. A person will forget and forget and forget and then their face will insist on itself in a shiny thing and something comes back that the city can use. He looked in the coin and between two breaths I saw it: the green ribbon when it had been a leaf. He closed his eyes. He opened them. There was wet in one. He shook his head.\n\n\u201cI am tired,\u201d he said, and there it was, the word that can be a spell for both sleeping and waking. He turned and left so quickly it looked like a gust. The girl stayed long enough to say, \u201cShe is making something that does not melt. That will be our winter roof when winter forgets itself. What will you make?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeftovers,\u201d Kaarna said solemnly, and there was bite in it.\n\nWe ate none of the day, which is to say by dusk we were hungry enough to mistake scruples for crumbs. We gathered at the dry dock with our small army. The crows were silhouettes with decisions. Oma Hilma stood in her apron with the bread knife, and there was a red smear of lingon on the blade that made me think of holidays. The ferry man was a shape near the ramp, an inconvenience to himself. The busker did not come down. He stood on the quay above and sent a line of sound like a lifeline. It caught on the bags and slid and caught again. The wind that had spent the afternoon crawling between buildings came clean off the water, new-napped, just dangerous enough.\n\nAava\u2019s ship had fattened. That was the only word for it. It was rounder, more certain, less like a tangle and more like a decision. She had laced the handles through handles until the whole thing had become a woven refusal. The boy stood inside the clear belly of it like an idea placed under a bell jar. He saw us and did not wave. He pressed his palm to the plastic and it made an oval around his hand the way milk makes an oval around the spoon.\n\nWe attacked our part, which never feels like an attack. It feels like laundry, like unlearning a bow. We cut on the off-beats. We made the arguments we had practiced under the bridges. The crows went for the handles. They hung on them and let their weight worry the plastic until it made little noises of complaint. Jaakko made a sound like a knife across a bottle and K\u00e4ry made a sound like a joke told in the wrong company and both sounds had purpose.\n\nThe busker played the note that made my wings heat. It fed the crows courage they did not admit to needing. The ferry man fumbled expertly with a rope so there was a knot that would want to become a knot at the wrong moment. Oma Hilma held up a fish gut on her knife like a flag and yelled something in a kitchen language that got under the ship and prodded. The ship moved as if it had thought and its thought had been interrupted. The sound it made came up through the dock into my feet and made me taste dandelion.\n\nWe were seen. It was inevitable and unimportant. Aava dropped the premise of not being cruel and sent the creased ones out on ropes that were nearly ropes and nearly hands. Handles became lassos. Kaarna cried out as one settled around her middle and found the place where breath is a hinge. We went for her with ugly love. The plastic resisted like a story that does not want to be told except the flattering bits. I stabbed with my pin and Sisu used his teeth the way prayers are used when the approved ones fail. The handle tore. It did not break; it tore. There is a difference. Kaarna fell into me and swore in tree language and I felt the bruise I would have in the morning and was grateful for it because a bruise is something the body understands.\n\nAava lifted her arms. The clapping of her dress was applause and accusation. She shouted something I could not hear because the wind did not want me to. The boy looked up at the note, that busker\u2019s braid of sound, and I watched a thought land on his face and not be hunted away. He turned his head a degree. He put two fingers in his mouth and blew a whistle he thought he did not know how to make. It did not carry to us, but it did something to the space inside the ship, which is to say it made a pocket of ordinary there. For a second I saw his hair be hair and not a place for static to live.\n\nThe ship bucked. The ferry man made his mistake and the gulls took the cue and told five jokes at once and forgot the punchline and laughed anyway. The crows pulled and the bridge wind argued with itself and the busker hit the note that was a window breaking. I jumped for a line that was not a line, just noise pretending to be one. My wings flared in a way they had been threatening to for days. They did not stop me from falling. They slowed the idea of the fall and in that margin Sisu did the thing we had promised. He bit me.\n\nPain has as many dialects as Finnish. This one had the honesty of a slap on a cold morning. It pulled the plastic squeak out of my ears and deposited me unceremoniously in the scrape of stone. I shouted a word that a busker would not put in a song and got up, which is a grace. Sisu shook his head to rid himself of my taste and looked apologetic in the way of someone who has given you a gift you asked for and wishes it had been nicer.\n\nWe got Kaarna out. We didn\u2019t get anyone else. We cut and cut and the cuts made the ship look festive, which was humiliating. The ship swelled again. It lifted and went sideways in a slow majestic indecision that meant she had learned something from us and would not give us the same angle twice.\n\n\u201cBack,\u201d S\u00e1ga said, not cowardly, which is a way I want to be when I am old. \u201cShe knows our knives. We keep the knives, we keep our hands. We cut again tomorrow when we are hungrier. We will not be hungry enough if we go now.\u201d\n\nWe vanished in the way only people who are supposed to be gone can. The crows took one last handle and tore it in contempt. The busker let the note go because notes are not meant to be captured. The ferry man made a knot that untied itself the moment it thought no one was watching and smiled at the convenience of it. Oma Hilma made a tutting sound at the ship measured in grams and went home to wash it out of her apron strings.\n\nBack on the roof the city tried to make itself seem simple. The tram sang in its practiced good voice. The cathedral\u2019s steps held their breath like someone taking a photograph of themselves. My wings felt like two bags of warm flour tied to my back. Sisu shaved butter off the promise of a breakfast with his teeth and laid it on a piece of bread that had no business still being a bread. We ate and did not talk until the silence had the decency to stop being proud.\n\n\u201cShe learns,\u201d he said finally, pushing a crumb toward me with one fingernail as if he were a waiter and this a theater. \u201cSo do we. We will not go at her edges again. We will go at the middle. If the middle is a lie, it will not take a cut. If the middle is a knot, there will be ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has put the boy at the middle,\u201d I said. \u201cOr perhaps he put himself there. I think he thinks he can steer. I think she told him that even a child can steer if he is polite to the wind.\u201d\n\nI lay back and the tar lion on the roof became, with effort, a lion. The truth that had been tapping like a polite knuckle at the underside of my bench had come out onto the roof with us, a cat with patience. It walked the edges of my thought as if they were a fence. It told me something in the way that cats do, by refusing to make it easy. It said that the boy would not be taken away from this by a knife or a word. It said that he would not be taken away at all. It said that he would walk from it or he would not. It suggested, as politely as possible, that I had loved the idea of being the thing that saves him more than I loved the boy.\n\nSisu watched my face shift and did not ask. He has the discipline to let you come to your own bad news. He went to the edge of the roof and examined the city for holes. He came back with the kind of information you store in your cheek like sugar.\n\n\u201cThere is a cat,\u201d he said. \u201cDown on the blue balcony opposite. It has a ring around its neck. A plastic ring from a six-pack, one of those white handcuffs that the sea leaves on the doorstep. It is purring as if it has never had a bad day. It is the wrong kind of advertisement.\u201d\n\nWe went to look because you have to look when a metaphor turns up at your house and knocks with its paw. The cat was ginger and had elected to be beautiful rather than merely pretty. Around its neck the ring sat like a careless crown. It did not choke him yet. It would. The ring had the same wrong shine as Aava\u2019s dress. The cat met our eyes with the boldness of someone who assumes everyone loves him and is right enough to keep assuming until the day that assumption kills him.\n\n\u201cThat is not my cat,\u201d said Sisu, who likes all cats until they notice him and then likes them more. \u201cBut I will bite it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will un-ring it,\u201d I said. \u201cTomorrow we will cut the middle of a thing too large. Tonight we will cut the ring off a thing that purrs.\u201d\n\nWe found the way across the courtyard and up the drain that had a cracked bracket and then over the eave where the paint had been red when someone had time. We made the leap to the blue balcony because when your friend is dumb you become brave without calling it that. The cat watched us with the mildness of a god. He put his chin up as if showing off the problem.\n\nThe ring was old enough to have a name. It would not admit to it. I held it and it was slick with neck. Sisu braced his forepaws and leaned his weight into the small mercy. The ring hissed. It did not have lungs. It hissed. I put the pin in and felt the point slide along the inside of something that had, once upon a time, held a promise of cold beer and conversation. I pushed. Sisu pulled. The ring gave in the way walls do when they realize the siege will be longer than pride can survive.\n\nWe took it away. The cat shook himself and did not say thank you because he was a cat. He rubbed his face against Sisu with the generosity of someone taking credit for the problem\u2019s solution. He lifted his tail in that way and walked along the balcony rail as if he had discovered balance. The ring lay on the paint like a dropped threat. I put my foot in it and felt the memory of strangling pretend it could still have me. Then I took it and folded it and folded it again and again until it could not remember how to be round.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d Sisu said, in the tone of a person who will pretend not to be proud so you can be. \u201cNow eat.\u201d\n\nWe ate. We watched the ship\u2019s absence in the sky like a bruise that had not come up yet. We made the plan that is not a plan, which is to sleep and then try again. I made a private plan I did not say aloud, which is to find the boy when he is nowhere and put a thread, no, not around his wrist, that would be a handle, but in his pocket, a thread that would tug at him when the plastic sang too sweet. It was a plan of superstition, which is often the only kind that handles children.\n\nIn sleep the city went on without us. It will always go on without us. That is its blessing and its insult. My wings hummed with a hurt that had put a blanket over itself and pretended to be fine. I dreamed a small dream in which the busker came down to the dock and put his violin against the plastic and the plastic said, this one I will keep, and the busker said, you will not, because I am wood and horsehair and human regret and I am more stubborn than a shopping bag. He was right. It was a petty dream. I woke to the sound of rain deciding not to, and Sisu making the sound he makes when he is arguing with sleep as if it owed him money.\n\nMorning arrived with a sneeze. The city scraped its chair back and went to work. We went to the market before it was properly awake and slipped into the shadow of Oma Hilma\u2019s stall. She gave us fish guts with the formality of a priest and we carried them in a paper cup that had once held coffee and now was ordained to carry gratitude. We set the guts at the place the queen had told us, where iron and salt argue, and watched the crows arrive with the self-respect of judges who have packed their own lunches. They ate with their eyes on us, which is how crows forgive.\n\nThe busker was late, which means he had had his own morning. He stood and tuned while the tram sighed and the gulls arrived for their insults. He played the note without thinking about it and made a face that said his fingers remembered something his mind did not. I waved, which did nothing. Sisu scratched behind his ear and left the tiniest fish-smell there so his sleep would have a story.\n\nWe went down to the docks to see what tide the day had. Aava\u2019s ship sat farther out from the lip of the dry dock than before, as if it had been trying its rooms on for size in the night. The creased ones moved inside it like thoughts being rewritten to please someone else. The boy was not there. He had gone home, I told my stomach. He had eaten soup out of a mug and lied about where he had been. He had told his pillow what he would name the ship if anyone let him. He had done none of those things. He was on the rocks near the far end of the dock, with a stick he drew with, pushing the wet, finding the dry under it.\n\nWe watched from a crack that had been put there by a frost that takes compliments badly. He was drawing the outline of a bird. He made the wings too long and then did not correct it. He put a circle in the middle and I thought of a handle.\n\n\u201cDo not,\u201d Sisu said, and I did not, not the thing he was warning me against. I did another thing. I took my thread and a laugh I had not used yet and I knotted the laugh in the thread and I tied the thread, softly, to the button of his coat as he leaned to draw. He did not feel it, of course he did, maybe he did, and the thread lay there like a very thin promise that if the wind asked him what his favorite noise was he would maybe, maybe, answer with birch leaves and not the mouth of a bag.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d Sisu said, because even plots need porridge. \u201cThen cut. Then bite me if I forget to tell you to stop being noble.\u201d\n\nHe meant the middle. He meant we had been slicing the ruffles off a dress and pretending we had altered a bride. He meant it kindly. We stuffed our mouths and our pockets and set our courage in our shoes so it would not be left behind on a bench. We went to the place we had not gone, the square under the belly of Aava\u2019s ship where the ropes gathered into something that was not a keystone because plastic does not admit to stone, but something like it. It was a hub made of handles woven into handles, an ugly daisy of human habit. It pulsed with a living that embarrassed me.\n\nWe crouched beneath it with the city\u2019s worst tools: our attention, our patience, our particular pettiness. We saw how the handles had been braided to allow for stretch, to welcome mistake. We saw how the stretch would snap back if you cut here but sag forever if you cut there. We saw the place you never give anyone in your house: the real drawer with the real scissors in it. It took all day to see it properly. We were bitten by plastic as if it had something like teeth. We were scolded by gulls who thought they were on our side but also thought they deserved more fish. We were watched by the ferry man at his post who did not smile because he was busy holding the shape of his face together for everyone else.\n\nWe began to cut. The pin went in and balked and then became correct. The first strand gave us nothing, which is how you know you have found the middle. The second tried to make a little loop to trap us and we did not put our finger in it, which is a victory. The third made a sound like a very small apology and went. The fourth wanted to be a story and we let it, just for the laugh we had knotted into the thread to remember us later.\n\nWe were halfway through the wrong way to do the right thing when the creased ones came down, in their smooth-eyed sincerity, their careful helpfulness, and a boy\u2019s sleeve brushed my face from above, so close I could smell the damp cotton and the not-yet of soap. He hung there with his hands wrapped in a rope, legs bicycling the air in that way children have when they are about to learn gravity again. He looked down at us with that wink still in him somewhere and I felt something like rescue move its shoulder in my chest, testing the fit.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Sisu breathed, and for once I agreed instantly, because if there is anything I have learned in this city it is that not yet can save your life more often than yes, now.\n\nWe cut, and for the first time that whole made thing ahead of us moved as if its idea had been nicked. It was not a collapse. It was an admission. The handles for a moment did not know their own plan. The wind took a prudent step back as if in case. Aava turned her head a hair\u2019s width. The boy\u2019s fingers slipped a knuckle and then found themselves again. The ferryman blinked and missed a gull stealing a pretzel from a woman\u2019s lap and the woman laughed because she had needed to.\n\nWe were making a hole in the place where breath had been made wrong and letting out just a sliver of its wrongness. It was the smallest success I have ever been so fond of. We did not celebrate because celebration requires lungs that are not currently learning how to be felt again. We put the pin away. We bound the thread. We left. We left because leaving is a craft and we had to be good at something that day.\n\nThe cat was waiting for us on the roof, smug, which is to say he was a cat. He had found a new ring to put his paw through, a child\u2019s bracelet that had not known what would happen to it when it stopped being darling. He offered it to me as if I were missing jewelry. I took it and hung it on a nail because that is one way to tell the city, no, not there, not like that.\n\nSisu fell asleep with his head on my arm and did his small practice chewing, which is how you know he will live forever. My wings hurt like a name said wrong repeatedly. I lay and listened to the wind say its name correctly to itself, once, the way someone says it on a train platform when they are late and cannot help their laugh. I thought of the boy, and the thread, and the middle, and the big, and I did not promise anything to myself except that I would eat in the morning and cut in the afternoon and be bitten if I earned it and that I would try to love the boy for his small ordinary rather than his story. It is harder. It is better. The city approved, not loudly, just by failing to annoy me for five breaths in a row. That is as wild as approval gets here.\n\nIn the middle of the night the rain finally happened. It came in thin clever lines that knew where old leaks lived. Somewhere a bag flapped itself free of a fence and went across the courtyard like a ghost with a bad sense of direction. I rose on my elbows and watched it and did not give chase. There is such a thing as letting your enemy exhaust itself on furniture. There is such a thing as sleeping while the city worries without you. I am learning that thing, which must mean something is wrong with me or something is right. The roof smelled of tar and apology. Sisu made the sound that means butter with jam in a dream. My wings lay heavy as loaves. I let the rain name the night and kept my own quiet.",
