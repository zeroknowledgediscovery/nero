     "novel_text": "Before dawn the fairy chimneys wore their own shadows like shawls. The rock towers hunched and leaned and peered over the salt flats, taking in the hush before the muezzin\u2019s voice braided the darkness with morning. Leyla stood on a smooth ridge of ignimbrite, her palms open to the sky, and whispered to the wind. It was never dramatic with her\u2014no thunderclap, no flying. The magic came as breath does; it came as the cooling of stone under her bare feet, as a small flicker in the corner of the world where anyone else would blame the eye.\n\n\u201cGel,\u201d she said, not because she thought the wind knew Turkish, but because the syllable cut her tongue cleanly enough to let whatever was galloping through her blood tumble out. She felt it like she always did, an agreement with something older than her family, older than the praying caves riddling the cliffs: the wind pulled, spun once, brushed her face and left the taste of copper.\n\nShe watched it lift a pinch of dust and set it down again at the edge of a cracked pool. Good, she thought, soft. No glare of flame, no sudden slicing cold. Soft was what she liked. She had no taste for hot, for conquest, for the kind of power that made you a story on the dust of a jug. She blew into her cupped hands, so faint it might have been a sigh. The salt water hushed, a wrinkle smoothing itself. A white moth that had slept under a blade of grass now woke and twitched as if it remembered wings. In a little while, people would walk here, to the wells and the fields, and they would say in the clipped tongue of the village that the day felt lighter. They would say it without looking at her. That was also the way she liked it.\n\n\u201cLeyla!\u201d The low shout unhooked her from the hush. She turned to see Yasemin climbing the hill, a scarf twisted around her wrist like ivy. Yasemin\u2019s hair was a home for sunlight, it made no sense; she had looked like a summer the year she turned ten and she looked like a summer now, at twenty.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re up with cinler.\u201d Yasemin crouched, panting, and then, with the economy that came from practice, tied her shoes tight with a jolt that bit the laces into obedience. \u201cMy mother will blame me if she finds the milk on the stove turned. She says I attract nonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe milk curdles because you flirt with it.\u201d Leyla smiled. She tried not to show the exhilaration that still moved like a bird inside her. \u201cYou smile and it thinks it\u2019s yogurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the witch,\u201d Yasemin said, and rolled her eyes. \u201cCome, teyze will worry. Babaanne was asking for you yesterday. She says the sky blinked three times, that the Nazar fell asleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cBabaanne says the needle falls asleep and it\u2019s an omen if she can\u2019t thread it in one try.\u201d But she felt it, the way an old boat feels the grain of the water. She could pretend she didn\u2019t know but she did. Something had been rubbing the edges of the day raw, and now the village air had the taste of a story the day before it was told.\n\nThey walked together down through the chimneys where tourists would come later to take pictures and pretend that they were alone in a place that had waited only for them. The rope swing that Zeynep\u2019s nephew had hung from a cedar smelled of dust and cypress resin. A shepherd on the slope cut through the morning with his flute and the goats became dots moving across the brown field like seeds on bread.\n\nAt the gate, the pomegranate tree bowed. Leyla touched the trunk, thumb to sap, palm to roughness, and her mother\u2019s voice rose through the kitchen window: \u201cElini y\u0131ka! Breakfast.\u201d\n\nZeynep had already filled the low table with bowls that adder-wrapped around each other, olives black and green, tomatoes cut so that the middle held a star of juice, a plate of beyaz peynir sweating faintly in the heat of the room, and bread. Always bread: a crust with hairline cracks, as if it had been kissed by the map of the fields.\n\n\u201cGel, k\u0131z\u0131m.\u201d Zeynep caught her by the wrist, that mother-grip that saw everything and had its own history. \u201cYou\u2019ve been walking again?\u201d She kissed the spot on Leyla\u2019s forehead where worries sometimes alighted. \u201cYou smell like stone. Sit.\u201d\n\nBabaanne Sabiha had been quiet that morning; her clouded left eye did its wandering, the right eye watched with a cunning that proved she was not yet entirely lost to more ancient conversations. She wore her scarf tied under the chin, the old women\u2019s tie that held secrets tight.\n\n\u201cTell me your dream, Leyla.\u201d Sabiha\u2019s voice snuck like a cat under the table, and Yasemin bit into a piece of cucumber, the crunch satisfying as a fable well told.\n\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d Leyla poured strong tea into tulip glasses and remembered to lift the pot high to arc the mahogany. \u201cI always dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one where you woke with your breath crossed,\u201d Sabiha said. \u201cYou came to the yard and fed the chickens with your slippers on the wrong feet.\u201d\n\nZeynep laughed, but it caught on a nail of worry. \u201cThat was last week. She woke to the ezan, confused. Or she pretended to be, to get out of going to the shop for flour.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t pretend.\u201d Leyla folded her bread around a wedge of cheese, as if protection could be eaten. She put the first bite in her mouth and let salt and softness mingle on her tongue so she could think. \u201cIt\u2019s the same, mostly. A house of leaves. A window with a green view but the green is too loud. A woman who speaks and the words are thick with honey and you don\u2019t want to swallow them but she keeps talking. She knows my name. She says, come and see how I have fed the fountains.\u201d\n\nSabiha\u2019s spoon paused over the olives. \u201cA house of leaves. H\u0131.\u201d She sucked her teeth, an old music. \u201cAnd the fountains?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey run with wine in the dream.\u201d Leyla shrugged. \u201cI wake thirsty.\u201d\n\nYasemin\u2019s laugh pinged off the copper pans. \u201cSign me up, witch. A fountain of wine? Sabiha nine, you taught her to dream like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think you sign up for dreams like for a line at the bakkal?\u201d Sabiha\u2019s eye sharpened. \u201cK\u0131z. There are places where water runs sweet and thick at the same time and to drink is to promise. There are women who feed gardens with our names. They call out the ones with old blood. Sometimes they call to steal. Sometimes to make a song.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Zeynep said, but she looked at her mother and at her daughter and the bread tore in her hand like a fragile map of worry torn across nowhere. \u201cEat. Work. Pray. Go to the market and help Hasan. He keeps giving away simit to girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe gives me dried apricots,\u201d Yasemin said. \u201cNo one gives away simit.\u201d\n\nNo one gave away what mattered. That was something Leyla had learned early, when her father left for Istanbul with a pack of electricians and then stopped sending money or letters or the brittle postcards that folded like a complicated apology. People who said they loved you always had a stop under their feet like a trapdoor; they could vanish and call it rescue.\n\nShe washed the dishes with her mother, the soap cool and the plates refusing bubbles in that stubborn way of good ceramics. She slipped her hands into rinse water and felt, far away, under the bones of her wrists, a low thrum. It was like the steady distant drum of a festival you don\u2019t remember being invited to. She looked up and the room tilted left like a gondola might, if it decided to dream of the sea beyond everything.\n\n\u201cLeyla?\u201d Zeynep\u2019s hand on her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re somewhere else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thinking of the market.\u201d She set a glass to dry. \u201cYasemin, shall we go? Before the sun eats us.\u201d\n\nPer\u015fembe Pazar\u0131 sat under planes of blue like an accidental poem. The stalls were swollen with vegetables, the shade nets thrown the way fishermen throw their hope onto the water to see what bites. The smell of bread, of hard soap, of dusty seeds waiting for spring\u2014these were the village\u2019s breath.\n\nHasan stood behind his counter with the confident slouch of a man whose family had owned that patch of olive-scented wood longer than anyone cared to measure. His shirt said \u201cNo problem!\u201d in English that didn\u2019t know it was either weary or aggressive. He brightened when the girls came and slid a paper bag of apricots across the slope of his scale.\n\n\u201cMy treat, witches,\u201d he said. The word was a shape he repeated because he liked to hear himself make it. \u201cTake and remember your humble greengrocer when you are famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll conjure you a wife out of eggshells and garlic,\u201d Yasemin said. \u201cShe will cook and scold in one breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlhamdulillah,\u201d he said, then blinked, because irony sat badly on him. \u201cWhat do you need today?\u201d\n\n\u201cFlour. Salt. A bit of cumin.\u201d Leyla leaned into the shade, grateful to pause between the press of people and the sunlight. \u201cThe new figs are late.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be here when they\u2019re ready.\u201d Hasan tied his bag with a twist practiced by hands that had learned to do three things at once. \u201cLike the rain.\u201d\n\nOn the edge of hearing, something cracked. It was tiny, an eggshell in a wide house. The blue beads on the string behind Hasan, the nazars that had watched a thousand transactions, all swung at once. For a moment\u2014only that\u2014they faced inward, the eyes turning to the wall. Hasan, superstitious in the way of men who would deny superstition while refusing to let Knives lie blade-up, swore. \u201cAllah Allah\u2026\u201d\n\nLeyla\u2019s skin prickled. A wind ran the lanes, catching scarves, making plastic bags tumble like poor ghosts. It stopped before it reached her. The stop itself was what felt wrong. The wind\u2019s habit was to skim and spin and then go; it had never braked in front of her like a horse smelling fire.\n\n\u201cLeyla.\u201d She turned to find Hoca Celal behind a stack of crates, his long fingers reflected in the metal of his spectacles. He wasn\u2019t often in the market; he belonged to the library that clung to a corner of the mosque like a remora. He was the one who had slipped her a book of Sufi poets with paper-thin pages when she was fourteen; he was the one who had said, \u201cYour heart knows the steps.\u201d He did not smile now. \u201cCome by when you\u2019re done. Bring the same palms you brought yesterday. We have work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat work?\u201d Yasemin snapped a grape and Lid of water popped open and spilled across the table, \u201cShe\u2019s not your apprentice, hoca.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right.\u201d He inclined his head to her, eyes soft. \u201cI am hers.\u201d\n\nHe left like a sentence that no one had the patience to finish.\n\nOn her way to the library later, she passed the well. The circle of stones breathed cool air as if it had a throat and a set of lungs like any village elder. The surface glimmered, a little oil slick making a rainbow handshake if you looked too hard. Leyla did look and the rainbow\u2019s bands rearranged themselves into a different order, violet where orange should be, a wrong that was too pretty not to note. She felt the interruption in her spine. The well had a story tomorrow. Today it was writing.\n\nThe library smelled like paper that had known rain and forgiven it, and of the old wood of shelves that had straightened men\u2019s backs without their consent. Hoca Celal had cleared a space and set a small bowl on a cloth embroidered with tiny tulips. The bowl was copper, dark with age and polished in the way that says this thing has been loved with the hands and not a chemical.\n\n\u201cIn the old days,\u201d he said, and she prepared to let her mind drift because in his mouth the old days came as the water of the fountain: cool, layered, and slower than a hurry, \u201cthere were women who lived alone on the hills. Not because they were banished, not because they were broken. Because they listened for the spun sugar in the air. They took the sugar and made spells that tasted like truth. People went to them with blank paper. The women wrote the letters that had not yet learned how to be spoken. They called them yaz\u0131c\u0131.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this story,\u201d she said, gently. \u201cMy mother told me to be careful with story-men.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother is impeccable,\u201d he said, and bowed like a man who in his secret life loved theater. \u201cBut she tells it slant, so you herself will do the rest.\u201d\n\nHe poured water into the copper bowl. The surface settled. He tilted the bowl so the light from the small high window spilled onto the water and came to rest like a hand. Then he took a pinch of ash from a jar and let it fall. The ash did not diffuse so much as arrange itself, and Leyla could not say where the arrangement, which was not arbitrary and was also not a picture, placed itself inside her. The pattern had the rightness of pottery. It had the violence of a lightning strike you watch from the safety of a stone house and yet you feel in your teeth.\n\n\u201cYou have been walking mornings again,\u201d he said, voice casual. \u201cThe kapadokya stone takes the echo of your steps and the old ones listen. It is polite, of course, for them to respond.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask,\u201d she said. The defensiveness surprised her; she tasted iron again and thought absurdly of her mother\u2019s nail on a lemon.\n\n\u201cYou were born asking.\u201d He brushed his finger along the rim of the bowl. The water hummed so soft it may have been her own heart singing back to drink itself. \u201cThere is a woman knitting something in the shade. She thinks she is making a shawl but it is a fishing net. Each loop says a name.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose names?\u201d\n\n\u201cYours. Mine. Hasan\u2019s. The ones who make bread, the ones who make buses run, the ones who will say \u2018this is the story of the time the sky fell into the pockets of our coats\u2019 and then forget it while their goats give birth and their children learn to count.\u201d He looked at her as if through her. \u201cShe is not making a shawl. She is making a sieve. She will sift the world and keep the fines and toss the rest.\u201d\n\nLeyla felt a simple anger that embarrassed her. \u201cWhat do you want me to do, hoca? Go to the hills and unknit the woman?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to begin.\u201d He pushed the bowl toward her. \u201cBreathe.\u201d\n\nShe breathed. The copper pushed her lungs open. The water remembered the salt flats and told her its truth: such as it had. She felt the tug of the dream house and saw, now, the woman\u2019s hand on a casement carved with leaves. The leaves were vines, the vines were mouths, the mouths whispered names the way thirsty people whisper water: with need and in prayer. The woman\u2019s face shifted. No, it was never stable, it was a cloud over a mountain and the mountain was the past and her past had many names. One stuck. Esmeray. Dark moon. The shape of her mouth was almost kind\u2014but empty in the corners, like a cup that had been poured out so often it forgot when it was full.\n\n\u201cLeyla,\u201d the dream said, and the library sank. The bowl in her hands went cold like a coin. \u201cLeyla, come. I have been making a place for you. It has a bed that remembers your bones and a garden where the roses tell me who I am. Come, and I will show you fountains. I will show you how to stop wanting. You will not want to breathe again. No one will. The hush is very good.\u201d\n\nShe pulled away as if from a cliff. The bowl slopped water onto the tulips, and Hoca Celal\u2019s hand was under the edge before it could slide. He did not look at her like she had failed. He looked at her like he was learning a map of the inside of a storm.\n\n\u201cYou see?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI see a woman who wants to stop the world.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cShe wants to stop it at full bloom. She cannot handle bruises.\u201d\n\nEsmeray. The name perched on her tongue like a leaf bird. If she said it out loud, would it start to tear at the corners?\n\n\u201cI am supposed to\u2026 what? Keep the world bruising?\u201d She laughed, and the laugh was three notes too sharp. \u201cIs that what saving looks like?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat saving looks like,\u201d he said, \u201cchanges depending on who is doing the looking. There are orders in Konya and in Istanbul and in places where the map reflects only sky. They will want your name. They will want to put it on a chain. Some of them will pray to you. Others will ask you to pray to them. I want you to keep your own name. That is all I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already have too many names,\u201d she said. \u201cK\u0131z, cad\u0131, o\u011flum\u2019s shadow, stubborn donkey who won\u2019t marry. And now this. Destiny is overrated.\u201d\n\n\u201cDestiny is a wind.\u201d He smiled like a man who had lost his teeth to laughter and had gotten them back by faith. \u201cYou can set your sail. You can drop anchor. You can dance on deck and spill tea and curse, but the wind is there.\u201d\n\nOn the way home, the sky had the thick look it wore before dust storms. She watched men secure tarps, women gather carpets in from the line, a child stand in the street and raise her arms, certain she could catch what ran between houses if she made her body into a net of joy.\n\nShe went to the well with a jug. The women there had their skirts tucked up into their waistbands, their sandals almost soaked in the breath of the old stone. \u201cIt smells wrong,\u201d one said. \u201cLike a burned pot.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything smells wrong in summer,\u201d another replied. \u201cEven husbands.\u201d\n\nThere was a tone to their jokes they wore only when the cold fear sat in their shoes. Leyla leaned over the circle and the well\u2019s face stared back at her, wet and hot at once. The rainbow was gone. The water was black the way a crow is black when it isn\u2019t pretending to be blue. A shape moved under the surface. That shouldn\u2019t be. The well did not have fish, had not in anyone\u2019s memory.\n\nShe almost turned because she did not want to be the kind of person who puts a hand in where she cannot see the bottom. But it asked. The bowl in the library had hummed; the well growled. She set the jug down and nodded to the woman who had married too young and was already carrying a second child in a belly hard as certainty.\n\n\u201cBana bir bez getir,\u201d Leyla said softly. The woman handed her a square of cloth, clean, with the printed blue flowers worn almost to ghost.\n\nLeyla tied the cloth around her wrist. A habit: not magic itself, but the shape of care she drew around it. She took a breath and reached, fingertips cutting the heat like knives into soft cake. The water resisted first and then took her like a mother who thinks you are leaving before the tea is finished. Something slick brushed her finger. She did not snatch back. It brushed again and slid under her palm. A fish. A fish in a closed well, strong, the length from her wrist to her elbow. She closed her hand and felt the tail slap twice, life, life, life, and then something else light and hard caught against her thumb.\n\nWhen she pulled her arm up, the water clung in strings. In her hand the fish shivered and then with a tiny snap broke into scales that were not scales but leaves, thin and almost translucent, like the first pages of a holy book. They fell and stuck to the stone. The thing she had caught with her thumb refused to sit anywhere properly until she willed it to. It was a ring. Copper, wide, with a slice of carnelian that had a crack in it like a lightning fork. It had the weight of a name.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother,\u201d the young mother said, \u201chad a ring like that. My uncle stole it to buy cigarettes.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything stolen returns eventually,\u201d an old woman said, and spat for luck. \u201cOr it makes babies elsewhere.\u201d\n\nLeyla dried her arm, heart stuttering like a bird. She slipped the ring into her pocket because when you have just stolen something from the dark you do not let the sun see you pass it hand to hand like gossip. Later. Later she would look.\n\nThat night, the dream did not wait for sleep. It climbed into the room by the window, silent, agile as a cat. The walls took on that green that is not color but intention; the bed under her held her as if deciding whether to keep her or to fold and pack her in a trunk for winter. A small nudge, and she was in the garden.\n\nShe had never seen such a garden. It was governed. The cypresses were too tall for their roots and bored of heaven. Roses wove themselves into tapestries of red so thick you could sew a boat from them and the boat would sail only in one direction: toward one name constantly spoken. There was a path. Paths everywhere, looping and lassoing and then leading to a wide flight of stairs that went up to a house made of leaves lacquered with light. A lush castle. Not a fortress of stone and dangerous angles, but something that grew and let you forget that you were walking into a mouth.\n\nEsmeray was on the stairs. She had a dress that shifted like shadow when light thinks too hard about its purpose. Her hair was gathered in a low knot that you could undo with one tug, and she wanted you to think about the tug, to feel it tick in your fingers, to make the wanting into duty. Her eyes were deliberate. Her smile was practice.\n\n\u201cLeyla.\u201d She said it with the dryness of a woman trying to hide thirst. \u201cCome. You are late. We have built fountains. The world cries too much. Let us stop the leaking. Let us stop the wind. It rattles the windows. Your people say it sours the milk. Let us close the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop?\u201d Leyla looked at the roses. They were perfect from far and plastic from nearer and she understood then that their perfection came from forgetting how to bruise. They had no smell. They had been coaxed into a silence that looked exactly like obedience. \u201cThe world spills for a reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it is clumsy. Because it is young. Because it has not learned yet what a sharp woman can do.\u201d Esmeray waved her hand and a fountain rose. It was clear, not wine now but crystal. Then it paused, froze mid-fall. The drops hung like beads on a string. In the pause there was a relief that ached. She was not wrong: the relief was a narcotic. Not wanting to want again felt like a way to save yourself from the sorrow of the second mouthful.\n\n\u201cYou want to kill breath,\u201d Leyla said, and heard how dramatic she sounded. But truth has a costume and sometimes you have to wear the whole thing even in daylight.\n\n\u201cI want to hold it between finger and thumb and count,\u201d Esmeray said. \u201cI want to keep from the mouths that bite and do not think. I want to save you from spilling down the steps of this garden with your stupid jug. I want to sit here and hear the many names said in the order I choose. I want to stop the scamper of time. It runs, it runs, it\u2019s exhausting. Aren\u2019t you tired, Leyla?\u201d\n\nLeyla was, in fact, tired. It was not smart to say so. \u201cI dream of you and I wake thirsty.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrink.\u201d Esmeray lifted her hand. The drops that had hung in the air arranged themselves into a string of pearls and then into a goblet and then the goblet was in Leyla\u2019s hand, heavy and cold with an edge that said this object could cut you or be used to club. \u201cDrink and stop. You owe your people breathlessness. They furnace themselves to feed days that do not thank them. Give them a rest.\u201d\n\nA woman at the edge of the path bent low and picked a rose with two fingertips as if pinching a nerve. She looked up at Leyla. Her face was the face of the bread-seller, then the face of the woman at the well, then Yasemin\u2019s face, then a face she had not met yet, then her own face at nineteen and the day her period did not come, then her face at eleven watching the goats while the sky blotted itself out because the women had said there was a dragon. The woman smiled with all of those faces and blew a kiss and turned to thorn.\n\nLeyla set the goblet down on the step. The drops did not spill. They did not resume. The goblet kept the shape of the held breath even after she let go.\n\n\u201cI like bruises,\u201d she said, because sometimes you have to say something dumb to see if it gets you kicked out. \u201cI like how they fade and tell a story in yellow and then green. I like that story.\u201d\n\nEsmeray\u2019s eyes went flat for a second. Then she gravely nodded. \u201cThen go and acquire as many bruises as you need, little mirror. Bring them back to me. I will teach you to keep them alive forever.\u201d Her kindness froze. \u201cNot yet. But you will come back.\u201d\n\nLeyla woke with her mouth dry as a ceramic bowl. She swung her legs out of bed and put her feet on the cold floor to remind her skin whose it was. The ring slid against her thigh from where she had tucked it into the seam of her pajama pants like a stupid child hiding candy. She pulled it out and turned it once in the half-light.\n\nThe crack in the carnelian was not simply crack. It had been etched, faintly, with letters that did not stay still. She set it on the table and the letters did not want to be looked at, and then they did, as if irritated that a human would presume to try to read them without paying. She tilted her head. The script ranged over Arabic calligraphy this way and Hittite cuneiform that way and then, for an instant, something like the loops her grandmother made in her embroidery when she wanted to hide a prayer in the border of a pillowcase.\n\n\u201cEs- me- ray.\u201d The letters smiled at her when she dared say it. Her tongue betrayed her and gave the syllables sweetness. \u201cG\u00fclce. Dark moon.\u201d The ring was both a gift and a theft; it had stolen itself from the well so she could have it. A stupid thing, an arrogant thing. A thread.\n\nShe went to the kitchen because the muscles of morning made coffeepots lift themselves and hands find olives. Zeynep was already there. Of course she was. The lemon half rested on the cutting board like it had just told a joke that no one had gotten yet.\n\n\u201cB\u00f6yle, k\u0131z\u0131m,\u201d her mother said without greeting her, and pinched a paper-thin line of salt into the pan where eggs slid toward their appointed place. \u201cToday you go to Konya. Visit your aunt. She needs help with the carpet order. The bus leaves at nine.\u201d\n\nLeyla looked at her with the slow respect of a woman who knows her mother\u2019s veils and how they sometimes shift to reveal other women underneath. \u201cWhich aunt?\u201d\n\n\u201cEmine. The thick one.\u201d Zeynep flicked her eye toward the ring before she could stop herself. \u201cShe is the sort of woman who does not lose rings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are sending me away?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sending you where you can be found by those who are looking responsibly.\u201d She wiped her hands and pulled a card from her apron pocket like a magician who uses only domestic objects. The card was yellowed, stamped with a seal she did not read. An address. \u201cYou will go to this place. There is a man who is a woman who is a man who is neither. They will tell you what their name ought to be today. They will tell you about the ring. You will not show your throat to anyone who calls you princess.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a princess.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy head knows it. Your feet know it. But your heart forgets. It is too easy to want someone to close the door and stop the wind that annoys you while you cook.\u201d Zeynep put her hand to her daughter\u2019s cheek. The thumb made tiny circles as if smoothing worry into ghee. \u201cI lost your father to a story. I will not lose you because you are writing the new one and forgot to hold the pen. Take Yasemin or do not. She will be offended if you ask; offended if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask,\u201d Leyla said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll let it be her fault.\u201d\n\nLater, at the bus stop, Yasemin was already there with a bag so small it made a mockery of travel. She wore an expression that said, I\u2019m angry you made me come and I wouldn\u2019t have forgiven you if you hadn\u2019t. Hasan had stuffed a paper bag into her hands, apricots and a small roll of lokum dusted like an old wedding.\n\n\u201cI told him we\u2019ll bring him back a wife,\u201d Yasemin said, almost cheerfully. \u201cMade of eggshell and garlic, with hands like a sharp pillow.\u201d\n\nThe bus ground in on a cloud of diesel and a smell of old upholstery. A woman three seats back had a baby wrapped onto her spine like a turtle\u2019s house. A man with cheap sunglasses had a suit jacket slung over his shoulder and a municipal swagger. Leyla took the window because she had always preferred to sit with the world and let faces slip past like fish, each flashing a piece of the sun and taking it away again.\n\nWhen the road curved and the fairy chimneys were gone, the flat opened and the sky let its own weight be seen at the edges. Leyla touched the ring in her pocket and the bus muttered and coughed. She felt a tug ahead, like the road was a ribbon and someone was winding it around their wrist, pulling.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re quiet.\u201d Yasemin had her head turned so the gold hoop in her ear could be admired by passing oversight committees if they looked in through the bus\u2019s greasy glass. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to dive in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might be.\u201d She glanced at her friend. \u201cYou can get off at the petrol station and go back. I won\u2019t be angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t have the chance.\u201d Yasemin\u2019s mouth bent. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop the wind if not you? You were born with your hair stuck to your lip from the breeze, my mother says. Don\u2019t come back with some city boy who drinks imported water and tells us we\u2019ve been sitting wrong our whole lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo boys,\u201d Leyla said with a sigh that didn\u2019t know what it meant. \u201cJust gardens. And a woman with a castle made of green. She wants to stop us.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants to stop herself,\u201d Yasemin said unexpectedly, and then folded into sleep like laundry arranged well.\n\nThey rolled. Village to village. Mosques with new paint and minarets that had tried to grow taller overnight and failed. Tea gardens with empty plastic chairs waiting in squares where men would sit and watch flocks of nothing pass. At the edge of everything, always, dust, lifting in little warnings. Konya rose from the plain, square and sensible and old, with Mevlana\u2019s green dome throwing itself up like the first line of a poem that refuses to make sense until the end. The bus slowed. The city did not notice them enter. It had bigger work.\n\nAt the stop, a man with a suitcase larger than his grievances tripped and apologized to the air. Leyla and Yasemin stepped into heat that scolded and immediately forgave. The address was a few streets away, tucked in a lane where all the doors were taller than expected and each had a knocker divided into two rings: one for men, one for women, so you knew how to answer.\n\nThey found the door with the seal from Zeynep\u2019s card carved over it. Leyla lifted the smaller knocker. The ring was heavy and the sound it made was not a knock. It was the sound of a book closing.\n\nThe person who opened the door was old the way the moon is: with a youth that repeats itself. Their eyes made a ladder. They smiled in the corner with one side of their mouth and frowned with the other as if to remind the world to expand and shrink at once. Their hair was covered and uncovered: a scarf looped but not tied. They wore a ring of their own, black stone and silver.\n\n\u201cYou are late and you are early,\u201d they said, and their voice had the geography of throat-singers and lullabies both. \u201cCome in. Put your name in a bowl and see which letters float.\u201d Their gaze took Leyla in with the gentlest greed. \u201cYou brought a ring but left your good luck at home. Good. Luck hides you from the world\u2019s true edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cZeynep sent me,\u201d Leyla said, cautious with the way words liked to jump out of their skins here. \u201cShe said you would tell me what to do. She said you are a man who is a woman who is neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am R\u0131za.\u201d They bowed with an angle that felt like a short prayer. \u201cIt is enough for today. Tomorrow I will be a complaint. The day after, a celebration. Sit. Everyone who matters sits before they stand.\u201d\n\nYasemin hovered, then realized the hovering was the exact opposite of what the room wanted, and she let gravity have her knees with a soft oof. The room was lined in carpets that had held ankles through disputes about God. Books leaned against each other like cousins. The ceiling was low enough that you had to nod to your own thoughts.\n\nR\u0131za set a simple ceramic bowl on the rug between them. They poured water. No copper, this time. Earth. When they set the ring down at the bottom of the bowl, the carnelian throbbed once and then fell quiet. R\u0131za looked at it without greed. (It was important: the way the looking landed.) They blew across the surface. The water shivered, and the letters that had refused to sit earlier now rose like fish eager for hands.\n\n\u201cEsmeray,\u201d R\u0131za said without surprise. \u201cOld friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know her?\u201d Yasemin\u2019s voice broke with the child in it and tried to force itself back together. \u201cWhere is her house? We will burn it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps later.\u201d R\u0131za\u2019s eyes creased. \u201cIf we burn it now, we burn Leyla with it. There is a thread already. The woman throws them out like fishermen and waits for the sea to remember who made it. She is patient.\u201d\n\nThe room shifted. No, it was the day: the day cast a new light and the small motes of everything, dust and tiny mistakes and glances, became visible. R\u0131za dipped their finger into the bowl, then lifted the finger to their mouth and tasted the truth.\n\n\u201cYou are not the first they called,\u201d they said. \u201cBut you are the one this time. The old song has its lines and then a line that wanders. You are the wandering line. It will make the song better. Or it will make everything break. \u015eans.\u201d\n\n\u201cLuck.\u201d Yasemin locked her fingers and unlocked them. \u201cYou said she left her luck at home. On purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe brought me instead,\u201d Leyla said softly, and both her friends glanced sideways at her and accidentally smiled because the truth sometimes has good manners.\n\n\u201cYou think too small.\u201d R\u0131za flicked water at her, blessing or sarcasm or both. \u201cYou will think big later. You will hate it. For now: you begin. There is an Order here, yes. There is an echo in Istanbul where men who cannot be quiet wrap insults in their faith and call it fasting. There are women who spin in rooms without witnesses and call what they feel by the names of their grandmothers so they can keep it. All of them want to move and to stop. Esmeray offers stopping. You will offer moving. That is the fight.\u201d\n\nThey looked at the ring again, and the ring lay in the water like a sleeping animal who dreams of running. The crack caught the light and threw it somewhere only Leyla\u2019s cheek felt. \u201cYou will go to Istanbul,\u201d R\u0131za said. \u201cYou will meet Esmeray halfway. You will not go alone. You will carry names like food. When someone tries to call you something that sours your teeth, spit it out. All right?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Leyla said, and felt the yes unscroll down her bones. \u201cI am not a princess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d R\u0131za\u2019s mouth was kind now, and tired. \u201cYou are a witch. There are no tiaras, only bruises. Gather them. Give them to me later. I will write them into our carpet and we will walk on forgetting and remember anyway.\u201d\n\nOutside, the sky rummaged in itself and found thunder. The first drops of a large rain slapped the stone like a grandmother\u2019s palm on a child\u2019s back: stern, loving, unavoidable. The wind ran around the corner and through the door and lifted the thin hair on Leyla\u2019s arm like a curtain opened two minutes too early.\n\n\u201cHaydi,\u201d R\u0131za said, and the word tilted the world. \u201cBegin.\u201dThe rain went at the courtyard like a drummer who had waited too long to play and now forgot what quiet tasted like. It beat the stone dark and tamed the dust into fragrant mud, lifted the iron smell of the earth so it could bless and scold in the same breath. Inside, R\u0131za\u2019s house gathered the weather and turned it into story. The carpets held the sound like a palm. The kettle took the hint and began to hum.\n\n\u201cTonight you sleep here,\u201d R\u0131za said, already lining a low bed with sheets that had the crisp feel of something folded perfectly and put away against the day when it would be necessary to prove that care had not gone out of fashion. \u201cIn the morning, you go. If you go while the rain is still honest, the road will admit you. If you wait until the clouds are only gossip, the road will play tricks.\u201d\n\nYasemin stood by the window and tried to count raindrops as if it were a way to keep from counting worries. \u201cYour house smells like somun bread when it comes out of the oven and everyone lies and says they\u2019re not hungry, just to be polite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the old flour,\u201d R\u0131za said, and winked toward a ceramic jar in the corner. \u201cWhen we forget to feed the starter, the house reminds us. Sit. We work with names and dough.\u201d\n\nThey brought out a wooden board with grooves so fine the eye lost count, and set it across their knees. The bowl that would have held dough, tonight held paper\u2014thin leaves of lokma recipe pages, old envelopes, thin blue aerograms that had failed to arrive anywhere. R\u0131za poured a little of the rain into the empty copper bowl not to use it, but to let the sound of the rain coming home live on the table with them. Then they drew out a bundle wrapped in cloth and untied it as if unwrapping a child\u2019s first shoes. Inside, there were stones. Not gems, or not only gems; river stones with names carved under the polish of hands. Each one fit its place in the palm like it had been waiting for this seller. Each bore a word. Some in scratchy Ottoman that made Yasemin\u2019s lip curl; some neat in Latin letters; one in Greek; one in a script that watched them watching it and refused to declare its allegiance.\n\n\u201cThese are not charms,\u201d R\u0131za said quietly. \u201cThey are weights. Names are heavier when they have lived. You asked how to carry names like food. You cannot carry soup in your pockets. You must bake it. You will do that in Istanbul.\u201d\n\nLeyla handled the stones and felt the way they pulled. Kad\u0131n. R\u00fczgar. Su. Ana. Heves. Sab\u0131r. Some were slippery because they wanted to be alive without being useful. Some were rough because they knew they had been used too often and resented it. She closed her fingers around one that was not the prettiest and felt it drop her hand toward her lap with its simple gravity. \u015eifa. The old word for a cure that was more temper than medicine. This one smelled of mint tea and wet wool. She kept it.\n\n\u201cPut three in your bag,\u201d R\u0131za said. \u201cOne for each of you, and one to give away in a moment you will recognize at once and then not forgive yourself for if you do not take it. Do not confuse recognizing with liking. That mistake has made and unmade empires.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take \u2018patience\u2019,\u201d Yasemin said, plucking Sab\u0131r with a decisive movement that already made the word look different. \u201cSo at least I can say I tried.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me the one that thinks it is stronger than it needs to be,\u201d Leyla murmured, and her fingers found R\u00fczgar by instinct as if the stone had shrunk itself to fit the place between her thumb and forefinger where wind always lived. She liked that the letter z in the middle was a hinge.\n\n\u201cFor me,\u201d R\u0131za said, and their hands, older than anyone\u2019s guess, chose Su with tenderness. \u201cI am too clever with air. Water makes me honest.\u201d They let the one called Ana slide back into the bowl because there are words you cannot pick for yourself unless you are a fool or a prophet. Then they took a different cloth and unfurled it to reveal a comb.\n\nThe comb was not for hair. Its teeth were long and thin and made of olive wood, stained in color at the tips: pine green, saffron, the blue of prayer rugs, pomegranate. It looked like a tool for grooming a map. When R\u0131za ran their thumb along the spine, the rain seemed to remember a rhythm it had learned in a tin basin years ago when a woman with sore wrists did laundry and sang.\n\n\u201cIn Istanbul you will visit my friend,\u201d they said. \u201cHer name is Feride. She lives in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar by the sea that thinks it is a river and pays rent to no one. She has a tray where she lays down water and thickens it until it learns to listen. She paints on it and lifts the paintings off. Marbling, the polite call it. Ebru, those who understand. The water is the page and the page is the witness. Esmeray loves Feride\u2019s work because it is water trained to hold a shape. Do you see why this is dangerous?\u201d\n\nLeyla saw immediately and wished she did not because seeing sometimes creates life. Ink laid on water that holds. Patterns coaxed smooth and fixed. Beauty that refuses to blur. She felt the pressure behind her eyes that meant tears were waiting with their shoes on, pretending patience. \u201cYou want me to go make a mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to go learn how to let the water keep a secret,\u201d R\u0131za said. \u201cA paper that knows how to forget can be a door. A paper that refuses to forget is a wall. There are enough walls. We need doors.\u201d\n\nYasemin\u2019s laugh bounced and then softened. \u201cYou are going to make me fall in love with a piece of paper and then tear it in half.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be brave enough to do it,\u201d R\u0131za said, and set their palm on her head briefly, a gesture so old it came through the door with its shoes off.\n\nThey ate the omelet that would not be improved by any more care, and Turkish coffee that settled into their mouths like a prediction that refused to be pinned. The rain declared itself done and went to find mischief elsewhere. Night came early because the clouds had forgotten to leave anything behind for the moon to dress herself with.\n\nSleep in a house that agreed with you was a thing to write a letter about, if one still wrote letters. The low murmur of traffic, the wheeze of a neighbor\u2019s faulty boiler, the mutter of the old cat in the yard telling the younger cats that no one had ever suffered like him\u2014these sounds made a quilt. Under it, Leyla drifted. She did not mean to dream, but dreams are a village and the edges are soft. She found herself under trees too straight and shining, with a leaf pinned to her breast as a badge. When she tried to blow on it to see if it was real, it did not stir. A child made of vines watched her with a boredom that felt like punishment. A fountain whispered. The drops suspended in air quivered like fish that cannot decide whether life will be warmer or colder if they jump.\n\nShe woke and wanted salt. She licked her wrist. There it was. For a foolish minute she laughed into the bedding until she had to bite the knuckle of her index finger to stop. Then she slipped the ring onto her thumb and let the carnelian sit there like a guest who might soon tell a story and might just demand more tea.\n\nDawn in Konya is a sensible thing. It does not throw itself at you. Men wiped their shopfront glass with newspapers so old the headlines had become spells. Women bundled toddlers and bags. R\u0131za had already packed what needed to be packed: the comb wrapped and slipped into a pocket that would not tell on it; the stones rattling against each other like cousins forced to share the back seat; a tiny jar with a pinch of gum tragacanth that smelled faintly of bitter roots and coming discipline. They gave Leyla a small notebook bound in soft brown leather and did not pretend it was magic.\n\n\u201cYou will write,\u201d they said. \u201cNot to become a yaz\u0131c\u0131. Not to make books. To keep your own name from wandering. People who do not write their names somewhere lose them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill it matter if I write gri for grey or boz?\u201d Leyla asked, tracing the spine. \u201cMy grandmother thinks one is for rain and one for wool and if you say the wrong one when you are talking about a pigeon, you will never be able to find your way home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will matter in your mouth,\u201d R\u0131za said, and kissed her forehead, then did the same to Yasemin, whose eyes betrayed her.\n\nThe bus to the city smelled as always of ambition and mopped floors. Yasemin bargained the fare with a driver who scolded and then winked and took their coins like a king who has decided he can afford to be merciful today. They found seats together and clamped their bags on their laps because they were not fools. Fields slid by, a green that could not be bothered to convince anyone that it was lush. The road unrolled its ribbon of tired endurance. Leyla watched the way puddles spoke back to the sky, then let her eyes close and feel the weight of the notebook in the top flap of her bag, the stones proving their weight against her thighs, the ring\u2019s lazy pulse.\n\nOn the outskirts, the bus collected more men than it wanted. A boy with battered sneakers got on, his hair shaved in a way that insisted it had been his idea. He stood by the door and balanced as if born to it. The ring on Leyla\u2019s thumb warmed when he grabbed the rail and spoke his mother\u2019s name to the driver with both sass and sorrow in it. Names know when they are said with love. She wondered which of her own names, if spoken aloud here, would make the ring heat or cool, and then decided not to play that game because there is a time and place for self-indulgence and it is never a moving bus.\n\nBy the time they crossed into the city\u2019s myth, the bus had already acclimated to the idea of traffic like a camel to a new ridge of sand. Billboards made polite lies and outrageous invitations in equal measure. Apartment blocks smirked down at older houses that had no interest in smirking back because they had survived men with guns and men with plans and both were only men. The air thickened with exhaust and a salt shrug that said, the sea is not far. Leyla would have known it with her eyes closed. The wind here had an accent. Poyraz, sharp from the north, had a bite even in warm months; lodos came fat and slow and put his hands everywhere.\n\nThey came in by Harem, the bus station that believed in perpetual arrival. Between horns and voices and the extraordinary drama of a man waving his hands at a woman who adjusted her scarf with an expression that said she would later tell this story differently, the sea flashed. It was a slick of pewter under the grey lid of the day. Ferries called, a blunt, longing sound.\n\n\u201c\u00dcsk\u00fcdar,\u201d Yasemin said, not because she didn\u2019t know where they were but because saying the name made a promise to her feet. \u201cThe woman with water.\u201d\n\nThey pushed through a crowd that did not need them and so did not dislike them. The square was wet with the morning\u2019s last mutterings of rain. Pigeons hopped, purposeful as bureaucrats. Men in vests shouted about fish and tickets, their voices sawing the air into usable pieces. The mosque stood with impeccable posture, green the way certain metals are patient. The tower of the Maiden watched from her island outpost like a woman who knows how to hold her own sad story without letting it swallow her.\n\nFeride lived in a building that had survived by convincingly pretending to be ordinary. A wedge of it took the corner. The stairs were the narrow kind that instruct you to place your feet one after the other as if you must be careful not to break the city. On the second floor, the door was open the way a language invites you in with a word that can mean both \u201chello\u201d and \u201cbe my guest or be my burden, we shall see.\u201d The smell met them first. It was river and glue and something sweet. Inside, the room along the long wall was window, all light that had made its mind up and then changed it because the sea does that to light. Tables. Trays. Brushes with horsehair bristles. The long combs like spines of small saints.\n\n\u201cHo\u015f geldiniz,\u201d said a woman whose face would have been severe if her hands had not immediately betrayed her into fussing with a stray thread on the edge of a paper that had already dried into certainty. She wore a smock already stained with blue that remembered the inside of the eye and a red that had refused to be quiet. Her hair was pinned up with a violence that suggested an argument with the day. \u201cWhich of you is the one who refuses to harden?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Leyla,\u201d she offered, and waited for the words to settle on the floor between them like dropped coins. \u201cR\u0131za sent us.\u201d\n\nThe woman smiled, not out of politeness; out of recognition of a name that had taught her something difficult and then fed her good soup. \u201cFeride,\u201d she said, and the name fit her. \u201cCome and be clumsy. You have one hour to misbehave with water before it decides it has had enough of us for today.\u201d\n\nThey washed their hands. It felt ceremonial because their hands remembered the well and two lifetimes of kitchens. Feride kept speaking while she set the tray, as if the room understood her as well as her students did. \u201cWe thicken the water with tragacanth from the mountain,\u201d she said. \u201cWe make the water into a listener. Then we lay color\u2014pigments ground to a paste with patience and something with a tongue in it, I refuse to tell you more until you have earned it. The horsehair brush speaks. The paint spreads. The comb teaches it to like order. Then I betray the comb. Because pattern is a way to lie.\u201d\n\nYasemin, who had been skeptical in the way of someone whose hands prefer plucking grapes to this kind of reverent labor, found her skepticism embarrassed by delight. The color when it met the surface spread in circles that felt like conversations overheard through a wall you had not believed was so thin. A drop of tulip-red teased the blue and then both agreed to be something else the way married people sometimes conspire against their own vows. The comb\u2019s teeth combed, and the water learned to accept lines. Feride made an easy peacock of it and then destroyed the peacock with one gentle pass of a stylus so that it folded back into a field of something like breath.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d she told them, and turned the tray. \u201cYou will never be sure a second time. Good. Certainty is a kind of mold.\u201d\n\nWhen she let Leyla touch the brush, the ring hummed. The water in the tray did not swallow the paint. It took it at the edge, then stopped, as if it had arms and had crossed them. Feride, who had not been watching, turned very slowly. She did not widen her eyes. \u201cAh,\u201d she said, in a way that means both greeting and curse. \u201cThis one already knows a way to be stubborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t me,\u201d Leyla said, and felt foolish because who else could it be besides her and the water and the good paint that had done nothing to deserve this attitude.\n\n\u201cIt never is,\u201d Feride replied. \u201cBreathe.\u201d\n\nShe breathed. The ring on her thumb warmed a degree. The paint hesitated, then flowed. She laid down another color. The circles that in Feride\u2019s hand had looked like deciding which cousin\u2019s wedding to skip, in hers looked like breath trying to find a place to live. She dragged the comb through. She was not delicate enough. A line snagged. A hesitation caught and held. On the second pull, she felt the drag become a voice that asked for a pause she could not afford to give.\n\nThe room shifted along its hinge. Outside, the ferry\u2019s horn came at the wrong time. No, the ferry was punctual, and the world had stepped a half beat off the measure. The hair on Leyla\u2019s forearms rose in a neat chorus. Feride\u2019s smile did not move but her body anchored itself without changing its stance; someone who has worked around small catastrophes knows how to hold a tray so it does not tell on you. Yasemin sucked a peppermint into the pocket under her tongue as if sugar could keep the air friendly.\n\n\u201cI felt you in Konya,\u201d said a voice that did not belong to a woman standing at any door and yet already had laid its elbows on the table. It was not in the room and it absolutely was. The comb in Leyla\u2019s hand trembled. \u201cI felt you at the well. I left you a fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou left me a ring,\u201d Leyla said, because arguments sometimes have to be opened with petty corrections. \u201cYou stole the fish as soon as it remembered it had been a page.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not steal it, I asked it to grow where it was placed.\u201d Esmeray\u2019s patience came like syrup, sweet and suffocating. \u201cYour mother was the one who taught you we do what we can for beauty. Look.\u201d The paint in the tray had frozen. They could move; the paint could not. The circles hung perfect. The comb\u2019s last path sat there like a thought that refused to be doubted. If Leyla leaned down, she could see her face reflected in the green center of one circle, and her face looked suddenly like someone else\u2019s\u2014the woman at the well, the girl on the bus, the infant with her mouth open in the catlike expectant posture of the newly arrived. The urge to leave her finger in until it was held was a pulse. The relief promised was indecent.\n\nFeride did not break any glass. She did not shout or make that frantic hand flutter that says, now we have a problem. She picked up the smallest of her instruments, a needle so old it had lost its right to shine, and touched the locked surface with the gentleness of a midwife on a baby\u2019s soft mouth. The skin of the water shivered. It wanted to refuse. It decided to accept.\n\n\u201cI work with what wants to keep secrets,\u201d Feride said into the air as if a child needed to be told to stop teasing the cat. \u201cI taught my tray to create a door. You can come whisper, Esmeray. But if you touch my comb, I will put vinegar in your fountain and make your roses weep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are rude,\u201d said the voice with interest rather than anger. \u201cI like rude women until they become inconvenient. And they always do.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of my workshop,\u201d Feride said, and then smiled because humor is a knife that cannot be confiscated at the door. \u201cUnless you have money.\u201d She lifted the paper in one seamless pull that made the image lay down its flag and agree to be carried. The pattern came up: circles layered like breath in a meditative chest, lines perfect on the left and messy on the right and beautiful in the way that made a person stop and want to put their lips to the page. \u201cPretty,\u201d she said, and then ruined it with a flick of her wrist that dragged a finger of brown through the red\u2019s self-satisfaction. \u201cNow it will not trap a child. Hang it.\u201d\n\nYasemin swallowed the peppermint. \u201cI had a headache and it left,\u201d she said, surprised. \u201cI was not telling you because I did not want to be the kind of woman who announces her pain like a weather forecast.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may announce anything you like in here,\u201d Feride said. \u201cTomorrow it will be gone and I will take credit. Again,\u201d she told Leyla. \u201cStop thinking of Esmeray like a queen. Treat her like the woman at the market who tries to sell you fat tomatoes in December. She is offering you an out-of-season sweetness that will fail you.\u201d\n\nThis time, when Leyla set the brush against the water, she thought of bruises. The purple at the edge of reminder. The way the yellow warms and then the green comes in sly. The way the skin tells the truth without asking you. She remembered the time she fell at ten and skinned both knees and the cement drank some of her and kept it. She remembered the day last winter when she slammed the gate in a hurry and pinched the crescent soft skin between thumb and finger, and it throbbed for a day; the ache had been her own metronome. The water gave up its stubbornness with less ceremony. She breathed. She dragged the comb, slower, an apology in her hand.\n\nThe ring on her thumb vibrated like a moth at a window. The crack in the carnelian threw a thin line of light onto the water\u2019s skin. The line moved, not quite obeying. Letters tried to form and failed because the medium refused to remember them; the tragedy made the page beautiful. A word in the old script that had refused to pick sides tried to rise and then sank as if someone who was not hungry pretended to be generous. Feride nodded once so small it might have been a twitch. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cNow ruin this one a little. Take it down from the wall where it would hang over someone\u2019s couch. Bring it into the kitchen.\u201d\n\nLeyla dipped the needle into the tray in a foolish little zigzag because mischief has to come from somewhere, and watched the perfectly rounded globes of red and blue accept their scars. The paper came up with a sound like a sigh through teeth. When she hung it, she did not think of buyers. She thought of the fountain in their village and the wrong rainbow and the way the fish had become leaves for a second and then nothing. She thought of planting and of the tobacco fields below the hill where the men had said there would be a factory one day if anyone could be bothered to organize. She thought of her mother\u2019s thumb on her cheek.\n\n\u201cYou came to me because someone told you to,\u201d Feride said when their hands had began to behave as if they had always worked like this. \u201cYou will leave because you want to. Before you go, you must write the names.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich names?\u201d Yasemin asked. \u201cWe have a handful already, and I am afraid of tripping over them and falling on my face in this city. People will laugh and steal my phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ones who will hold the door after you pass through,\u201d Feride said. She gestured to a low stool where a child had chalked tally marks as if trying to count all the ferry horns there had ever been. \u201cYou will need fishmongers, yes. And the woman who sells needlework and has always wanted to be a nurse. And the old man with the pigeon who still believes pigeons carry letters. And the girl who cleans the semahane after the tourists go and replaces the hidden water glasses with a patience that will save someone. And the one who sweeps the steps of the Galata tower every Friday and spits into the wind and gives thanks. And the young man who dances alone in his room to old Arabesk and thinks no one understands him. And the woman who thinks she hates the sea but cannot go a day without crossing on a ferry.\u201d She smiled at the way their faces had gone from worried to pleased to overwhelmed. \u201cYou will not meet all of them. You will meet the thread that ties them. If you touch that, it is enough. Now, go. Eat bread with fish. Stand on the bridge where men pretend they are the only ones who know how to wait. Take the ring near the current and see if it tells you whether the wind intends to be our friend today.\u201d\n\nThey left with paper that would warp if you looked at it wrong, and the comb wrapped and heavy now that it had been defied by a woman with a garden for a house. \u00dcsk\u00fcdar outside was its perpetual talking self, but the day had made a small adjustment to fit them. Leyla had the sense of stepping a half centimeter to the left of where she would have placed her foot an hour before. It was not unpleasant. It felt like saving your skirt from tea.\n\nBy the water, the men had their lines out. The gulls had an opinion about everything. A vendor pressed lemon into the cut of a fish with such tender violence that Leyla briefly wanted to marry him and then remembered she did not want marriage with anyone who thought their own sadness was the only interesting one in the room. They paid for two sandwiches and let the thin pickles try to convince the bread that life could be bright even after it touched frying oil.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d Yasemin said through a mouth too full. \u201cYou look like a woman who will go faint because a poem decided to stand over her and hide the sun. Eat, or I will tell your mother you let yourself be stolen by ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdeas are broke,\u201d Leyla said, obediently taking a huge bite. \u201cThey cannot get the bus fare.\u201d And then the ring went cold as if remembering a winter in a city where pipes froze.\n\nThe wind shifted. A heaviness rolled in from the southwest. The men fishing looked up in the way of men who live by the timing of elements. A child began to cry not because anything had happened but because the body knows the weight of lodos before the mind remembers the word. People become loud under lodos. They become tender or ridiculous. Women sweep more angrily. Bread goes stale faster; people shout at the bread. Eyes sting. Headaches bloom. The old city feels it worst, like a convalescent when someone opens a window too soon. Lodos was the wind Esmeray would choose if she could pick only one, Leyla thought. It numbed the edge where desire and grief shake hands.\n\nThe Bosphorus was never still, not even when the world pretended. Its two currents argued over who was the elder sibling. At the railing, the ring tugged toward the center as if recognizing blood. Leyla leaned. The water below broke itself into small fists and smoothed out, broke and smoothed, a conversation that will go on long after any of them remembered to listen. She could feel the comb in her bag like a reminder. She could feel the papers under her arm like a promise she had not had the right to make.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Yasemin said suddenly, pointing across at the opposite bank where houses shouldered each other and trees did what they could with little earth. A yal\u0131, an old wooden house right at the waterline, let the ivy have its way with it. The leaves made a mask instead of a face. Windows peeked. A balcony sagged with the kind of elegance only an aged flirt carries. It had the look of a place that had listened to secrets about sultans and shoe salesmen and had no intention of telling. It was beautiful and annoying. It looked like a place where someone could decide never to open a door again and call it wisdom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s her house,\u201d Leyla said, and felt foolish because there were a thousand houses that wore leaves and not a one belonged to a woman with a garden for a castle, but the pull was not pretending. The ring cooled and heated like a breath held and let go. She could taste copper the way she did when the wind agreed to listen. Something under the quay creaked. A ferry groaned and accepted passengers like a man who knows he will be confessed to against his will.\n\n\u201cWe go,\u201d Yasemin said. \u201cWe give her back her ring and tell her to shut her eyes and count to a thousand and then to open them and repent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go.\u201d Leyla folded the papers as if folding a child\u2019s shirt and slipped them deeper into her bag. The ferry horn shuddered through her. She stepped on board before thinking about money, and a man with a stack of simit on his head laughed and stepped aside and was blessed despite himself for it. The boat pushed off. The city spread itself, each dome and high stone a boast and a prayer, each splash against the hull the telling of an old joke.\n\nFeride had said to write the names. If she were the kind of woman who attended to advice efficiently, she would have found the notebook and begun. Instead she put her palm on the painted rail and listened to the sea reading a list that had no alphabet. She said the names silently. Zeynep. Celal. Hasan. Sabiha. R\u0131za. Feride. Yasemin. She did not yet include Esmeray because a name on the tongue is a coin you spend. The wind bumped her shoulder like an uncle who always pretends his jokes are better than they are. The headland took them and returned them, the city a mouth that chewed and did not bite.\n\nOn the other side, the steps up from the ferry were too tall for good sense and everyone took them anyway. A boy with roses said \u201cAblam,\u201d in a tone that suggested he would change his own luck if someone would let him. A dog slept in the most inconvenient spot he could find and dreamed of whatever it is dogs in this city dream of\u2014shaved meat, garbage triumphs, women\u2019s hands. They followed the narrow street along the water. The yal\u0131 waited. Its leaves moved without breeze. The ring cooled.\n\n\u201cDo you think she will answer the door,\u201d Yasemin said, collecting her courage into one braid and then deciding she would be prettier with it loose. \u201cOr will the leaves put a palm on our foreheads and say we have fevers and must go home?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the leaves had hands, we could become scarves,\u201d Leyla said, and knocked the old brass knocker that surprised her by being warm like someone else had just touched it.\n\nThe door swung a finger\u2019s width wider, not on the principle of hospitality but the way a man opens his jacket to show that he is not carrying a weapon and then remembers he is in fact carrying six. The hall smelled of cold. The kind that burns. The kind that sits in old wood and loves its own company. Leyla had the impulse to set a pot of soup down in the entryway and leave without knocking again.\n\n\u201cIt is impolite to keep a lady waiting,\u201d said the voice from too many directions at once, and the leaves shivered inside their own sound. \u201cCome in, Leyla. Bring me the things you think you are carrying so cleverly. I will take them, and in return I will take away so much of your weight you will resent me for making you light.\u201d\n\nThey crossed the threshold, and the air changed temperature without changing moral. The hall grew long when they walked and shortened when they paused. Mirrors watched them without being honest about how reflective they were. The ring apologized now and then. The paper under Leyla\u2019s arm whispered like a flock. She had the dizzying sense that if she set it down she would hear it try to complain itself into not being art.\n\nAt the top of the stairs where a landing shifted its size the way a tongue shifts a lie, a woman sat with both elbows on the banister like a teenager in disguise as a queen. The shape of her face altered as the light moved. The corners of her mouth were still empty. Her dress today was the green of olive leaves before the dust, and it moved when she moved, and sometimes when she did not.\n\n\u201cYou invited me to your garden,\u201d Leyla said, because starting with the obvious is a way to keep the floor from giving way. \u201cYou offered me a rest. I am stubborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Esmeray said, and smiled in a way that suggested the world had misdiagnosed her for years. \u201cCome. Eat. Then we will decide what to kill and what to keep.\u201d She turned, and the house breathed in. It became a garden on an exhale. The roses made the shadow of a smell. The fountains began to pour and then paused, caught between impulses.\n\nYasemin touched Leyla\u2019s elbow once, a signal they had worked out when they were nine and had stolen painted eggs. The signal meant: I am here. Do not be brave alone. Leyla let the push move her. She set the comb down on the edge of a marble basin as if putting a book on a bedside table. She waited to see if the water would scream.\n\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d Esmeray said lazily, eyes on the carnelian. \u201cYou brought me a toy. Good. And my ring. You are tidy, after all. Return it to me and I will give you back your mornings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot give me back anything I did not give you,\u201d Leyla said, surprised at the tone in her own voice, which had discovered sarcasm and set it to simmer. \u201cI brought you a comb to make you itch. And the paper you cannot bear to be near because it does not tell you you are right.\u201d\n\nEsmeray did not flinch. She walked to the nearest fountain and put her hand into the falling water. It halted at her wrist. It made beads like a miscounted rosary. \u201cI am tired of this,\u201d she said simply. \u201cOf being open all the time, of my own moving. Men move and call it conquest; women move and call it restlessness and shame. I do not wish to be the sea anymore. I want to be the lake in a painting where the ducks never tire.\u201d She lifted her hand and the beads of water hung in the air like ornaments that might be smashable or edible depending on your hunger. \u201cDo not make me into a villain so you feel prouder of your breath.\u201d\n\nLeyla could have wept because underneath the manipulation there was something she recognized: the exhaustion of being porous. It had a weight. It had bruises of its own. Her heart being a fool, she almost reached out to touch that tiredness. Her mind, a more loyal friend than she had credited, put a hand on her wrist and said, wait.\n\n\u201cI will not undo you,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cYou are a woman, and I am not an axe. I will ask for doors. That is all. Windows. Holes. Places where the air will sneak in and make you curse me and then thank me in your sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not sleep,\u201d Esmeray said, and the way she said it was so human that even the mirrors softened. \u201cI have not slept since my child went where the river goes underground.\u201d\n\nThe silence that followed was not the dramatic kind, rich with waiting for a violin. It was domestic. It placed cups on saucers and waited to see if the tea would overbrew. Yasemin, who had made a thousand mistakes and regretted thirty-seven of them, recognized honesty when it tripped over its own hem and fell into the parlor. She intruded before grief became performance. \u201cWe have brought bread,\u201d she lied, and pulled the paper-wrapped fish sandwich from her bag with reverence and stupidity. \u201cEat. Then we will fight like neighbors.\u201d\n\nEsmeray laughed in spite of herself, a sound that loosened something in the room the way rain releases a smell from the pavement after a long day of being stepped on. She took the sandwich. She did not taste it. She held it as a person holds a thing she knows she is supposed to want. She put it down. The ring on Leyla\u2019s thumb tightened of its own will, then loosened when she refused to notice. The comb sat on the fountain like an instrument that had waited in a corner of a salon for the right hands since 1843.\n\n\u201cYou can sit,\u201d Esmeray said, looking at the throne of leaves and then looking away as if embarrassed by her own arrangements. \u201cOr not. You can walk in the gravel and resent the way it moves. You can call me names. You can give me my ring, which was my grandmother\u2019s and then was mine and then was no one\u2019s in particular. Or you can wear it and be what comes next.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat comes next,\u201d Leyla said, sitting because her knees had suddenly decided to be old, \u201cdoes not have your map. Will you let the water move?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you put your face close enough,\u201d Esmeray said, and this time her smile was brief and brutal and not unkind, \u201cyou will see that even when I stop the surface to spare my heart, the lower water goes. It argues with depth and is always cleverer than me. I am not God, child. I am tired. I am a woman who tried to make a place where nothing would bite. I forgot that if you keep teeth from meat, there is no cooking to talk about.\u201d\n\nLeyla set the carnelian on her tongue as if she had always intended to taste it before returning it. The stone tasted of metal and stone and a hint of smoke that had never been fire. She took it back off and placed it in her palm and felt it choose its warmth. She lifted her hand and watched Esmeray watch it. She breathed and did not ask permission.\n\nWhen she spoke, it was not yet negotiation. It was invitation. It was only the first sentence of a letter she might get to finish if the house was kind and the leaves decided to change their minds and the fountain learned how to complain in a way that did not stop it entirely. She spoke the names she had practiced on the ferry. She did not offer Esmeray her own name yet. That would come. Names need hunger to fit. She took the comb and dragged it through the falling water where Esmeray\u2019s hand had held it still. The teeth cut the stream. The stream rejoined. The beads trembled and fell. The fountain replied to itself. The air smelled like a bruised lemon, like surrender with dignity.\n\n\u201cYou are insolent,\u201d Esmeray said, and her head tilted, and when her head tilted, everything tilted with it, even memory. \u201cGood. Stay, then. Eat my bread. Make a mess. I cannot stop you without making more of a mess. And you, little summer,\u201d she added, looking at Yasemin as if she were a window she might actually want to open, \u201cif you break anything, you will learn how to fix it without help.\u201d\n\n\u201cI break everything,\u201d Yasemin said with a cheerfulness she did not entirely feel. \u201cI am competent with glue.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlue fails,\u201d Esmeray said with the wisdom of a woman who had repaired more plates than afternoons. \u201cThread, on the other hand...\u201d She reached for the braid and half-undid it with a gesture that was not unkind, then changed her mind, put her hands in her lap, and the leaves at her shoulders trembled. \u201cBegin, then,\u201d she said, and this time there was no arrogance in it. There was only fatigue and a kind of curiosity that had weathered grief.\n\nThe garden breathed again. The fountains went on and then paused, then went on. The roses gathered themselves and, at the edges, where the light did not care to look, began to scent. It was the kind of scent you only noticed when you had stood up to go. It told you nothing you could keep. It insisted that what was living would bruise and then would heal. It offered no tiaras and a great deal of work. Leyla unclenched her teeth, only then aware she had been holding them like a key in a door that would not turn. She took up the ring and did not yet decide where it belonged. She would write later. For now, she had to be a body and a breath in a place that had almost forgotten both.\n\nIn the courtyard of a house that claimed to be a garden that pretended to be a house, a witch did what she knew: she made drafts. She placed the comb where it should not go and found out whether the pattern was worth saving. She walked with the gravel and let the crunch be a kind of percussion. She did not pray aloud. The house did not require it. Outside, the city went on being too much. Inside, it was possible to do a small thing well. Outside, lodos lumbered toward evening with sultry shoulders, and bread went stale quicker than it should, and a woman on the Galata steps spat into the wind and thanked God for lungs. Inside, the leaves learned the first letter of no and decided to practice it with grace.By afternoon the garden had discovered its second breath, the one it had given up on keeping for years. The fountains learned how to hesitate without locking their knees. When Leyla dragged the olive-wood comb through the falling water again, the teeth found a rhythm that did not so much cut as separate, like a woman parting her children gently before they remembered they were supposed to fight. The stream frayed into threads and then rejoined as if it had always known how. Esmeray watched, not with approval, not with disdain, but with a scholar\u2019s hunger when a student brings an answer that reframes the question entirely. Yasemin walked the gravel until it learned her body and stopped trying to roll her ankles into obedience; she tested the leaves with her fingers, found the places where they were lacquered and the places where they were still sap, then came back to stand by the fountain with a readiness that had nothing to do with violence and everything to do with the belief that she could stick her hand into a stuck machine and not lose it.\n\n\u201cWater listens when it is bored,\u201d Feride had said that morning, pressing their fingers into the tray until the skin of it acknowledged them without drama. In the garden, the water had not been bored in so long it had calcified its own enthusiasm. Now, faced with the comb and a woman who would not turn away from its sulking, it began to remember mischief. The smallest fountain at the far edge burped like a child surprised by its own body. Yasemin giggled and then put her hand to her mouth because giggling here felt like mocking a woman at a funeral. Esmeray\u2019s mouth tipped, unwillingly. The leaves near her shoulder unclasped a single pink at the throat of a white bloom, and then pretended they had not.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d she said, and it was not a command but a dare she placed on the step between them, like a coin that could be picked up by either hand.\n\nThey worked until the light flattened and then tilted toward the upper right the way it does in this city when the sea tells the day to stop being dramatic. The house learned the weight of three women moving in it. It expanded for them and then closed like a fan when they stopped. Doors that had always stayed slightly ajar admitted to their hinge and shut cleanly; others that had never opened creaked in surprise and then swung wide as if not wanting to be judged shy. The mirrors began to be honest. When Yasemin caught herself walking past one and saw her own face undressed of the flirt she wore like a scarf, she lifted her chin and did not reach to arrange herself back into comfort. The gravel, tamed, could be walked barefoot without complaint, if you were the kind of person who forgave stone its nature.\n\nLeyla kept touching the ring and taking her hand away\u2014not because she was undecided, but because she refused to make decisions on the edge of hunger. In the kitchen, there were jars, and in the jars there were legumes whose patient softness, once coaxed, would feed armies. No one had turned the flame under them for a long time. The cold smell came from habit, not from malice. She washed a pot with a cloth that had been folded away since before some wars and lit the stove. The first lick of blue felt like a prayer that did not require agreement. When she poured in the lentils, they made their cheerful rain against the metal, and the sound completed something the air had been trying to say all afternoon. Yasemin, relieved to have a place to put her hands that was neither comb nor leaf, broke onions with a competence born of having watched her mother curse sticky skins half her life. She salted at the right moment because she knew the difference between generosity and waste. When the cumin went in, the house blinked. Esmeray, who had not come into the kitchen in years because kitchens required intimacy with the daily and the daily had betrayed her, stood in the doorway and did not pretend she had been passing by.\n\n\u201cYou are cooking inside my house,\u201d she said, which was either outrage or relief phrased in a way that allowed her to decide later.\n\n\u201cWe are making food where people breathe,\u201d Yasemin said as if that were the only defense anyone ever needed. \u201cSit before the smell makes you think you are being stolen.\u201d\n\nEsmeray did sit, but on the edge as if ready to deny it if anyone wrote it down. When the first steam huffed itself against the windows, her shoulders loosened a degree. She noticed and scolded herself for it without changing her posture. Leyla set the bowls on the table without asking who owned the table; some objects ask their own permission. They ate with the single-mindedness of women who had worked with air all day and needed to be reminded of weight. The lentils were the right kind of soft, the kind that taught your mouth patience and then rewarded it. For the first time since they had climbed the steps, the house smelled of something other than the virtue of restraint.\n\n\u201cThis is witchcraft,\u201d Esmeray said finally, but there was no heat in it. \u201cYou change my water and take my hunger and pretend it was always your right.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo tiaras, only bruises,\u201d Yasemin said with a grin that couldn\u2019t help itself, and when Esmeray frowned in question, she waved a hand. \u201cA proverb I learned yesterday.\u201d\n\nAfter they washed the bowls with water that no longer tried to impress them by holding itself perfectly still, they took out R\u0131za\u2019s stones. Leyla had kept the cloth bundle against the small of her back under her sash where no one would think to steal it. She unknotted it now and placed the three weights in her palm. R\u00fczgar. Sab\u0131r. \u015eifa. They nested in the center of her hand like eggs unrelated to each other and yet sworn to the same weather. When she set them down on the table, the wood thudded with a small authority; the stones had learned how to be louder without raising their voices.\n\n\u201cWhat are these,\u201d Esmeray asked, and for the first time there was unguarded curiosity in her voice. \u201cThey are not talismans. Their vanity is too small.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are names that do not perform,\u201d Leyla said. \u201cR\u0131za said to carry them like bread. One for each of us and one to give away because the moment will recognize itself and if we do not, it will make a fool of us later.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me patience,\u201d Yasemin said immediately, reaching and then stopping herself because the stones were not to be grabbed. She waited, and the waiting pressed a gentle hand to the back of her neck. When she lifted Sab\u0131r, the stone set its weight along the bones of her fingers in a way that made her feel as if she had put on a ring too large even when there was no metal. Her face went quieter without becoming less bright. \u201cI will need it to keep from throwing things at the sea,\u201d she said primly, and no one in the room believed her.\n\n\u201cThe wind is mine,\u201d Leyla said, and took R\u00fczgar, which tried to bounce and then remembered that rocks were dignified and settled. When she slid the last weight forward, it throbbed like pulse under a wrist. \u015eifa. The word smelled like mint and carried the old complaint of winter nights. It wanted a hand that had held too many foreheads and refused to become cruel. It wanted a set of knuckles that had pressed a cloth blister-flat. It wanted intimacy without romance. She looked at Esmeray, not because she thought to give it to her, but because sometimes you must reject the most obvious gesture to make room for the truer one.\n\n\u201cI am not the person who will take your cure,\u201d Esmeray said softly, and did not pretend to be offended. \u201cI am the person who will instruct you on the misery of the cure, and then if I am careful, I will be grateful for it after you have gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we wait,\u201d Leyla said, and slipped the weight back into the fold of the cloth, feeling it settle into the verso of the other two, patient as a neighbor with a story that can afford to ripen.\n\nThe rain that had cast the city into its sulky afternoon dress went to rest in some other quarter where other women opened their windows and scolded it. Evening decided to rehearse. Lodos arrived with his lazy sleeves and his bad mood and his gift for making the cheap glass in a picture frame rattle just enough to recall an old fight. In Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, a boy shoved his best friend and apologized too hard; in Be\u015fikta\u015f, the simit turned dry a beat sooner and the seller cursed not because he lost money but because bread is not supposed to betray you. Down on the ferry decks, a woman who believed she hated the sea checked her watch three times and then stood where the spray could lick her calves, and when she got home she failed to tell anyone why her skirt was damp. In the semahane where tourists had spun and filmed their own holiness, the cleaner laid new water glasses with a precision that would have impressed saints and men with clipboards alike, then scooped the last of yesterday\u2019s salt from the shallow bowls and threw it into a plant in the corner that had been dying in a dignified way. On the Galata steps, the woman who spit thanked God in the old blunt way for lungs, watching the spit ride the wind into someone else\u2019s fate and chuckling because sometimes you must make offerings in the language your body will accept.\n\nIn the yal\u0131, the lodos pressed its face against the windows and fogged them with a slow breath like a donkey\u2019s. It muffled sound without granting quiet. The fountains felt the pressure and thickened a degree. The leaves shifted and then held. Esmeray rose and walked to the largest window, which had been coaxed to grow taller than windows should by a carpenter who knew how to flatter wood into imagination. She put her palm to the glass and the glass admitted her without letting her through. \u201cHe always comes like this,\u201d she said, as if greeting a difficult relative. \u201cHe is not clever, only persuasive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot stop him,\u201d Leyla said without triumph. \u201cYou can open a space for him to exhaust himself without breaking the cups.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not want to open anything,\u201d Esmeray said, and then sighed because now that the pot had been put on the stove there was no use pretending the kitchen did not exist. \u201cBut perhaps we must. If I keep this house clenched, it will grind its teeth down.\u201d\n\nThey stood together, their breath making small fog ovals that touched and separated like shy animals. Yasemin, who had been pretending not to be moved by the drama of wind, ran a finger along the lower frame and lifted up dust as if the house had to blush. She wiped it on her jeans and imagined Zeynep scolding her with a loud tenderness that could be heard in stairwells. The ring on Leyla\u2019s thumb cooled, then warmed, a small animal learning not to fear the hand.\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Leyla said finally, the way a doctor asks a question in a tone that suggests you may lie and is kind enough to accept it if that is what your dignity requires. \u201cYour child.\u201d\n\nEsmeray did not look at her. She looked at the picture the wind was making with the trees outside, a study in force that refused to accept composition. Her voice, when it came, was flat with practice and unexpectedly wet with the first unscripted word. \u201cHe had a name that belonged to the night. I will not give you it. He was soft and then too sharp. He wanted doors and I had already built a room. The river under the city called him the way certain songs call pigeons from places they have no business gathering. I asked for a pause. He gave me an answer. It was not to my taste. I decided to make this house obedient because the world had laughed in my face. You should have seen me then. I was magnificent and impossible to love.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople said they loved you anyway,\u201d Yasemin muttered, not because it was useful, but because the logic of the world irritates and must be named. \u201cThey always say that to women who refuse to organize their tenderness for other people\u2019s comfort.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did,\u201d Esmeray said, and almost smiled. \u201cThey prayed at my doors and asked to be made into statues so no one could come and ask for anything ever again. I sent them away with a loaf of bread. It softened their intentions.\u201d She dropped her hand from the glass as if remembering that the body cannot hold itself upright on refusal alone. \u201cGo to sleep,\u201d she told them, and the word said more than the instruction. \u201cIn the morning, if this wind has not bruised us stupid, we will braid a door and lay it across the water.\u201d\n\nThey did not sleep immediately despite the gift of permission. Lodos makes beds into arguments. The air felt used and personal. Leyla lay with the notebook under her pillow and practiced listing the names the way a child practices letters because her teacher has promised the act of writing will tame the story. R\u0131za had said the purpose was to keep her own name from wandering; she discovered, lying there listening to the house debate with the wind, that her name was not a house to be kept at all but a trail she had to keep from being overgrown by other people\u2019s footsteps. She wrote in her head. Zeynep, who had put citrus oil in the cupboards so mice would call the house rude and leave. Celal, whose long fingers had taught her the length of breath. Hasan, who would marry garlic if it would have him. Sabiha, whose one eye never wandered when money was on the table. R\u0131za, the person who could be a complaint without becoming small. Feride, who trained water into sincerity and then broke it so it would not betray people. Yasemin, who had always found a way to turn her anger into a lemon wedge. She did not add Esmeray. It was too soon for that kind of intimacy.\n\nMorning\u2019s light limped at first and then picked up its kneecaps and came in properly, as if embarrassed at having been caught tired. Lodos had not left, but he stood to the side now, flipping through a newspaper with indifference that he hoped would be mistaken for charm. The city went about its business in a stupor. The men on the bridge cast lines anyway because ritual is often more stubborn than mood. The ferry chugged from dock to dock because if it stopped the city would have to admit to itself what it had become, and no one had time for that on a weekday. In the yal\u0131, the water made its own mind up as to how it would behave. The fountains ran; they paused; they ran again. When Leyla dipped the comb into the first fall, the teeth shivered but did not bite. When she dragged them through, the separation came with ease, as if the house had spent the night teaching itself the lesson it resisted.\n\n\u201cWe take this to the Bosphorus,\u201d she said, because some plans become obvious when sleep unpacks without you. \u201cFeride\u2019s comb is heavy enough to make an argument, polite enough to be listened to. We will not stop the sea. We will not try to teach it. We will ask it to hold a door for a moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople will notice if the water makes a shape,\u201d Yasemin pointed out, knotting her scarf so tight it might have been argument to start a revolution. \u201cThey will assume a TikTok. They will gather. They will throw sunflower seeds and bread meant for gulls and opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will,\u201d Leyla agreed, and smiled because she had never before considered on purpose the useful stupidity of crowds. \u201cSo we must do it where attention is already busy and a shape will look like an accident. The Maiden\u2019s tower. The current dislikes her. It breaks and reformats and forgets what it was trying to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not leaving this house to be toyed with by lodos while my comb cavorts with the sea,\u201d Esmeray said, and then put on her shawl with such finality that both girls hid their grins. \u201cWe are going to the water. I am wearing shoes that were not designed for gods.\u201d\n\nThey took the long steps down past the small men selling larger opinions disguised as umbrellas, past the woman with roses whose frown was proof of self-respect, past the dog who had discovered a patch of sun and was unwilling to give it up even for a more ethical cause. The quay shone like a pan pulled hot off a stove and splashed. The light bounced with too much enthusiasm for a hungover city. The tower sat in its stubborn place in the water and pretended it had never been used for anything but beautiful stories. Boats shouldered each other like cousins in a doorway and then apologized in horn.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Esmeray said, choosing a place where the wall gave way to a set of steps no sensible person took on purpose. \u201cIf you fall, I will not save you, and I will miss you angrily.\u201d\n\n\u201cR\u0131za said to make doors, not proofs of concept,\u201d Yasemin muttered, nevertheless sitting and bracing her feet as if her body had decided not to fall without written permission. The comb came out of Leyla\u2019s bag with the seriousness of a knife at a wedding. She held it across her lap, feeling the color at the tips of the teeth stir. The lodos breathed heavy on the back of her neck and then remembered itself and turned trying to be coy. She lifted the comb and the ring warmed. There was a knot in the air over the water, not seen, but felt\u2014a clenched muscle in the jaw of the strait. She reached for it the way her grandmother had reached for a tangle at the back of her hair on bath nights, gentle until gentleness bored her, then firm with love.\n\nThe first pull did not take. The comb stuttered, as if there was an old net already there, invisible, snagging at the teeth. The second pull found purchase and snagged the snag. A small dark patch rose in the water like a stain coming loose from a shirt that had worn its existence unbothered for years. A boy two steps down laughed because a fish had startled itself; he did not see the sea wince. Leyla dragged, and the current under the surface that had always pretended to ignore instruction shifted a degree to the left and down. The maiden\u2019s tower coughed. A ferry coming in adjusted in a way only the captain felt and then told his friends later in the tea room with a modesty that could not hide his pleasure. Gulls shouted slurs and compliments in equal measure and meant none of them.\n\nThe door was not a door. It was an agreement between moments. It opened, not with hinges or with a sound people could pin to their timeline, but with a soft place where breathing was easier and yelling felt ridiculous. The lodos, fooled for a second into thinking it had achieved its aim, leaned in and then, finding no purchase, leaned back with wounded pride. Down the steps, an old man with a pigeon on his shoulder paused mid-step, blinked, and the pigeon decided not to spread its wings just then for reasons of its own. He looked at the women with the comb and the scarves and the stubbornness and recognized nothing and everything at once. He put his free hand on his chest and bowed because sometimes your body knows how to thank a stranger who has saved you the trouble of crying later. Leyla felt the weight in her bag twitch. The cloth around \u015eifa tugged.\n\n\u201cGive it,\u201d Yasemin whispered, and when Leyla turned, her friend\u2019s face had none of its usual trouble-making bent. It had quiet. \u201cIf you do not, your hands will smell of mint all day and the city will go sore by evening and you will say, why did I do this to us.\u201d\n\nLeyla stood and climbed the two steps toward the old man as if going to prayer. The stone under her feet, slick with the sweating of the day, decided not to be spiteful. She placed the small cloth bundle in his palm. He made a shape of refusal and then accepted because refusing a gift given by a woman who is clearly arguing with the sea is vulgar. He did not open it. He held it to the soft meat over his heart and nodded as if agreeing to carry a baby for a minute so a mother can sling her bag. \u201cK\u0131z\u0131m,\u201d he said, and his voice was warm as walnut. \u201cYou know the wind. May God make your bones patient and your roof not leak.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay your bird find letters that do not have to be read to tell what they mean,\u201d she answered softly, surprised by the way the words had waited behind her teeth like water behind a palm. The pigeon peered at her and made a small noise that might have been a secret delivered and immediately forgotten.\n\nThe door held as long as it needed to. The comb came away without complaint. The water forgot as politely as it had agreed. Leyla wiped the teeth on the hem of her shirt without thinking about it and tried not to imagine Feride inspecting the comb later with one eyebrow lifted. Esmeray\u2019s mouth was not empty at the corners for a full breath. It held the smallest ghost of grease from the sandwich and of gratitude.\n\n\u201cYou meddle beautifully,\u201d she said, which might have been the most honest sentence she had said since they stepped into her house. \u201cNow that you have given away your cure, you will have to learn new ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe only gave away the one that needed to go,\u201d Yasemin said, and the certainty in her voice came from the moment the little weight had left their keeping; she had not known she had been carrying her shoulders near her ears until they dropped back into usefulness. \u201cThe others will find us. We are sheep in a village with too many shepherds.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are goats,\u201d Esmeray corrected absently. \u201cYou eat what will kill you and then look surprised when you are stronger for it.\u201d She took the comb with a care that almost masked her greed and tucked it back into Leyla\u2019s bag herself, a gesture that insisted on intimacy, and then drew her hand away with the swiftness of someone who realizes what they have admitted. The ring on Leyla\u2019s thumb cooled into a question. The house on the hill shrugged its ivy and pretended it had not been watching like an aunt at a window.\n\nThey climbed back up through the day, which had thickened now into a syrup of opinions and relief. Market men argued their way into sales. Women carved paths with hips and shopping bags and generosity. A boy with roses offered a blossom, then denied it, then offered it again because he could not decide if life was a trick or a negotiation. When he thrust it under Leyla\u2019s nose, the ring hummed. She took the rose because saying no would have made the boy feel like the city had chosen a side against him. She paid, and he made change, and the look he gave her when they both fumbled coins as if fingers were ornaments only, told her something new about names: that sometimes you carry another person\u2019s for a minute when they are too tired to hold it.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill the semahane gate stood open to air it out after tourist holiness. The cleaner, a woman with wrists like clever loaves of bread, bent to pick up a stray water glass and placed it with the others as if each had cost her a day of her life. She glanced up. There was no recognition because people who keep places real do not insist on witnessing the dramatic. She smiled anyway, a pragmatic curve that meant, I see you carrying foolishness; may it not crush your lungs. Yasemin almost stopped and then did not, because she would cry as if she had invented crying and it would embarrass them both.\n\nIn the yal\u0131, the house had arranged itself into the version of itself that admitted that living was not a habit to be cut off. The kitchen smelled unabashedly of food now, even after the windows had been opened to let lodos sniff and pass. A bowl that had been put away for silverfish to nibble on had migrated to the counter. The bed in the small room they had claimed ceased behaving like an exam. When Leyla set the rose in a chipped glass, it drooped its head with a drama that made her laugh; a moment later, it decided it had been hasty and lifted an inch with resolve.\n\nIn the afternoon, with the city slow and the air undecided, they learned how to braid doors. Esmeray had not called it that; she had called it \u201ctying off air\u201d in a tone that suggested it was what one did for a crying child when all the adults were tired. But when she showed them how\u2014three strands of ribbon, one of silk stolen off her old dresses, one of old upholstery striping, one of the kind of cheap cloth you buy at a market when you believe you are being thrifty and are in fact being hopeful\u2014it made a shape that remembered braids on a child\u2019s head and knew it was more than memory. They measured the doorway not with a tape but with breath, crossing the threshold back and forth until the body knew the width without confessing it needed to count. When they tied the braid across, the house sighed. You cannot hang a net in melancholy and expect it to catch anything but the shadow of what might have wanted to be caught. They hung their net in insolence and useful joy, and it held the day without arresting it.\n\n\u201cEvery door has a stubborn place,\u201d Esmeray said, supervising as if she were trying to keep the impulse to snatch the work from their hands under a scarf. \u201cLike a woman\u2019s lower back. Rub there, not hard, not soft. The door will pretend not to notice. It will forgive you later.\u201d\n\nThey rubbed. The braid settled. A draft that had always bullied the corner at floor level found itself reassigned to the top; it went more slowly and with more grace, and in doing so admitted it had always wanted to be more civilized. The dust that took this corner as its own agreed to let the rest of the house breathe, on condition that no one mocked it for its failures. The leaf nearest the threshold, which had been lacquer for years, exhaled and became plant for one difficult second, and then went back, the way people return to old behaviors at the first whiff of trouble and need to be coaxed out with laughter and tea.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Esmeray, looking at the ring with frankness and the smallest flash of appetite, \u201cyour true offering.\u201d\n\nLeyla rolled the carnelian with its lightning crack between thumb and forefinger until the warmth it gathered was hers, not the room\u2019s. When she took it off and set it on the table, the stone lost a degree of heat like an animal stepping into shade. It did not try to run. It did not fold. It sat and let itself be seen. The letters inside it lay down, then stood up, then smirked and turned their backs like schoolchildren daring a teacher. She and Esmeray looked at it like a man and a woman look at a child who is neither of theirs and might still ruin both of their lives. The weight of its history pressed into the wood and nicked it.\n\n\u201cIt belonged to your grandmother,\u201d Leyla said, and refused to make her tone jealous. \u201cHer name was the kind that calls the fox, not the prayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer name would make birds go silent when she walked into a room,\u201d Esmeray said. \u201cShe wore the ring because a woman who refuses to soften must remind the world she knows how to be gentle with her own ill fortune. It was a piece of all the words we never say aloud. It is yours,\u201d she added abruptly, as if tearing a thread that had gotten caught on the wrong hook. \u201cIt is yours because this house did what I asked it to for too long and now it cannot ignore the fact that it likes you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything stolen returns eventually,\u201d the old woman at the well had said, dry enough to crack. Leyla picked the ring up and did not place it back on her thumb. She put it in her pocket, not like a thief, but like someone who knows that wearing a jewel is not the only way to carry it. The relief that ran through the house came like rain through a screen\u2014a hundred small cold kisses on skin that had expected only heat. She exhaled. Esmeray did not, and then she did.\n\n\u201cWhat will you do,\u201d Yasemin said, turning her face toward the window as if interviewing a bird. \u201cWhen we leave. Because we will. We have to go back and teach Hasan how to tell if a fig has lied. We have to keep Celal from turning your story into a riddle he will never answer. We have to remind R\u0131za to eat and that they are not required to be a complaint every other day. We have to bring apricots to Zeynep and make ourselves available for scolding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will I do,\u201d Esmeray repeated, and tasted the question as if it came salted and then decided it did not upset her palate. \u201cI will sleep in the kitchen once and make my back hurt and discover it is not the end of the world. I will let the women who sweep the mosque steps come in and have tea without my telling them how to hold their cups. I will go down to the quay when lodos pretends he is poetry and shout at him like a fishwife and impress no one and improve my lungs. I will become an aunt to the gulls. I will let the roses smell only at the edges and forgive them for refusing to center themselves in my plans. I will get bored of certainty and then relaunch my career as a difficulty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will write,\u201d Leyla said, and slid the notebook onto the table. \u201cNot for men with libraries. Not for prayer. For your own name, so it remembers which rooms to visit and which to pass by.\u201d\n\nEsmeray looked at the soft brown cover like it was a child offering her a spoon with a worm on it. \u201cYou are impertinent,\u201d she said, and there was no malice. \u201cGive me the pen. It has been centuries since ink embarrassed me.\u201d\n\nThey let the afternoon be the kind that does not get written about because it is not dramatic enough for men\u2019s tongues. They set up the bowls for Ebru on the small back balcony where the Bosphorus set the tempo and where the gulls coming in off the flat of the sea did not care who watched them scratch. Feride\u2019s comb, newly disobedient, remembered what it had learned about bending without dishonor. Yasemin stirred the tragacanth into the water with a patience she swore she had not acquired and which the stone in her pocket smirked at her about. The first papers they pulled were ugly, and they loved them for it. The next were pretty, and they ruined them, and in the ruining found relief. A boy below tried to sell them chestnuts before realizing the season had mistimed itself. He laughed at his own hustle and then remembered he could make money and shouted again.\n\nAt dusk, a hush that was not the hush of stalled breath but the hush of shared fatigue took the corners of the house and braided them together. Zeynep\u2019s lemon sat imagined on the counter across the city, sending its ghost ahead. The ezan rose somewhere in the neighborhood with the old confidence that says, even if the voice cracks and the radio gives out and a gull shits on the loudspeaker, time will be held between two hands and hand back to you without being precious. They did not pray; they took the time and let it sit, instinctively protecting it from opinions.\n\nWhen the first star decided to be seen despite the city\u2019s lights insisting they are more important, Yasemin rolled on her back on the carpet and refused to move. \u201cIf we do not leave soon, I will marry this house,\u201d she announced, and it was such an obscene thought that all three women burst into the kind of laughter that scrubs varnish off grief and lets it breathe. Afterwards, when their throats were raw and their cheeks wet and no one wanted to be the first to admit to needing water, they were quiet again.\n\n\u201cYou will go in the morning,\u201d Esmeray said, not because she wanted them to, but because the words had grown heavy and needed to be lifted. \u201cYou will take my ring and your insolences and the comb that no longer obeys me and you will stop the wind from treating your village like a chest it can push its knee against until the lock gives. You will bring me apricots that taste like a child\u2019s summer. You will leave me alone here with my house and my stubbornness and my desire to keep everything perfect and my discovery that it was killing us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come,\u201d Yasemin blurted, and then realized she had said the dangerous thing when she looked at Leyla and saw her friend\u2019s face open with the terror of a woman who knows invitations are flew arrows that cannot be caught without consequences.\n\n\u201cI cannot,\u201d Esmeray said, very gently, as if stepping sideways to avoid stepping on a kitten. \u201cNot yet. The house has agreed to practice saying no without clawing. If I leave now, it will go find a priest and pretend to be good. It will show him its mirrors. He will faint. We will never live it down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn spring,\u201d Leyla said, surprising herself. \u201cWhen the wind forgets to have an agenda for three days in a row. When the goats are unworried and the bread refuses to stale. Come then. Watch the stone breathe. We will argue gently with the well until it gives us all our fish back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will try,\u201d Esmeray said, and her eyes did not slip away. \u201cI will be the aunt you cannot get rid of. I will insult Hasan\u2019s tomatoes and teach your old men how to hold their insults like olives, not bullets.\u201d\n\nSleep, when it finally came, came clean. Lodos muttered outside like an uncle who has been told to stop singing and is thinking of sneaking in one more verse anyway. Inside, the braided threshold held the draft without pride. The leaves ceased performing and worked quietly at their work. The water ran without guilt. In the small room, Leyla dreamed of writing her name not on paper but on the inside of her wrist where pulse lives and where a woman can lift her hand to her mouth and look and remember without anyone being invited to the remembering. In the same house, a woman who had decided to finish the night safely awake fell asleep on the kitchen bench with her shawl over her knees and one hand on the table where the ring had been. Her mouth did not smile. It did not need to. It had learned a new resting shape that did not insist on being tragic.\n\nIn the morning, the city pretended it had always intended to be at ease. Poyraz cleaned up after lodos like a conscientious younger sibling. Ferries moved with their chests out. The pigeons did what pigeons do when no one asks them to help tell a story. They drank thin water from the seams between stones and forgot to fly until a child ran. On the quayside, the old man with the bird on his shoulder opened the cloth and found the stone. He did not know the word it said and did not need to. He put it in his pocket beside a string he had knotted thirty years ago. The bird pecked his ear, offended to have been not consulted, and he laughed out loud, making three people nearby believe they had now been blessed against small misfortunes for the day.\n\nThey packed. It is a trial to pack a house into a bag when the house has decided it will lend you some of its tricks if you promise to return them clean. The comb slid into its pocket rich with misbehavior. The papers, warping slightly because water is a clingy lover, lay between shirts and learned how to sit properly. The notebook went to the top where it could see. The ring stayed in Leyla\u2019s pocket where small coins and the odd apricot pit live and learn the politics of the intimate. At the door, the braid bowed as if inviting them to step over a story\u2019s threshold without making fools of themselves. Yasemin kissed her fingers and touched the braid. She would never admit later that she did.\n\nThey said their goodbyes without letting them become monuments. Esmeray hugged them each like a mistake she wanted to repeat. She did not kiss their cheeks because her mouth did not belong to anyone in that moment and she respected it for that. When they stepped into the bright nonsense of the day, the house closed its eyes and opened them again and did not trap anyone between its lids.\n\nAt the ferry, the man with simit stacked on his head had a joke he had been saving for two days and found that it refused to land, so he tucked it back behind his ear for later. The sea performed its complicated obligations. The city supplied actors and props and the right amount of rust. On deck, Yasemin leaned her elbows on the rail and let the wind slap her until she forgave it for future crimes. Leyla took out the notebook and wrote one line that tasted like metal and then honey and then dust. Then she stopped, because sometimes one line is enough map for a week if you know how to walk. On the other side, the bus would be impatient. On the other side of that, their village would pretend it had not been holding its breath, and then it would remember to be offended that they were late. She felt the ring in her pocket and refused to touch it out of a superstition she had not had yesterday and would deny tomorrow.\n\nAs the ferry cut, a door they could not see opened and closed in the seam between waters and men with hats who think they understand waters. No one clapped. Far away, in a library that smelled like paper that had forgiven rain, Celal Hoca put his finger on a line of Rumi and then lifted it again, having decided not to misunderstand a metaphor for once. In Konya, R\u0131za drank water and found it colder than it needed to be, smiled into the rim of the glass, and said, \u201cAh.\u201d In a kitchen where the soap had decided to finally lather properly, Zeynep stared at the lemon and did not cut it because sometimes you must leave one thing untransformed in a day so the day can find its way back to itself at night. In a yal\u0131 with leaves that had agreed to grow their own minds back one centimeter at a time, a woman stood in the doorway and glanced at the place where three heads had been last night and shook her head like a horse after a fly has left.\n\nOn the bus, the seats were upholstered in arguments that smelled faintly of cigarettes and prayers. A man with municipal swagger had lost it and was pretending he had put it down on purpose. A little boy practiced tying a knot and failed beautifully, then presented his failure to his mother like a flower newly invented. The road out of the city made its long slippy promise. Leyla took the window. She let the currents of morning, of wind and of the people who believed they were immune to both, press against the glass and turn into view. She would go home and argue with a well. She would hang a braid across a door between hot and cold. She would take a comb to the edge of a fountain and teach it that edges are not prisons. She would become a larger place for breath and make her mother complain she was letting in too much weather. She would insist on bruises and rinse them clean. She would keep writing her name until the page learned how to hold it without tightening.\n\nNear the outskirts, a woman who worked nights cleaning a semahane leaned against a wall, closed her eyes, and felt a small headache decide not to be born. She smiled because she would get to keep her patience for a son who would surely require all of it later. In the square, Hasan found that figs had decided to arrive without fanfare. He put one to his nose and measured the distance between now and the afternoon when he would eat it, then made the proper face because men like him must pretend they are not so easily made happy lest the world try to turn it into a joke. In the old yard, a pomegranate tree lifted. In the room where the bread\u2019s cracks mapped the fields, Babaanne Sabiha tilted her head like a bird and said to no one, \u201cThey have gone and come back already, that is what it feels like. My bones know their own grandchildren. Someone bring me my needle.\u201d\n\nOn the road, the bus shuddered over a seam and then remembered itself. The driver spat out the window and polished his mirror with a rag the color of a bad argument. Yasemin fell asleep with her mouth open, angelic in a way that would make her grit her teeth if told. Leyla kept watch, not because the road needed her, but because keeping watch is sometimes the only way to arrive with a story intact. She pressed her palm flat against the glass and felt the city fall off her skin like rain. When the first chimneys rose from the land in the distance like teeth in the generous jaw of the earth, she smiled. A wind out of habit tried to push her backwards and then realized its mistake and came up behind her like a friend hurrying to catch up.\n\nAt the gate of the yard, the pomegranate bowed and then shrugged because it was busy. Zeynep in the kitchen did not look up when the latch lifted; she said instead, \u201cElini y\u0131ka,\u201d and then added, \u201cDid you bring me my lemon back,\u201d and when Leyla stepped in and held out her hands like a child who has learned new manners, Zeynep glanced and knew in one instant that a daughter can leave to a city where wind pretends to be the only story and still come home wearing the right dust. The ring stayed in its pocket. The comb slept. The stones clicked once like cousins in the back seat. Showered in the light that belongs only to the plateau, Leyla breathed, and the breath did not behave like magic. It behaved like breath. It was enough.The day after their return wore its ordinary like a newly washed shirt, clean and familiar and still creased along the seams where the hands had pressed and smoothed. The pomegranate tree at the gate bowed in its old way, not theatrical, only respectful to the morning and to whatever news the wind had tucked under the leaves. In the kitchen the kettle made the sound of stories being persuaded to return to the mouth, and Zeynep, who had made a kingdom out of plates and hands, tilted her head the way women tilt their heads when they have counted the number of breaths in a room and found one too many. Leyla washed, the water running over her palms with a coolness that felt like admission. The ring in her pocket warmed, then remembered itself, then cooled; it behaved like an animal trying not to announce that it had come to live in a human house. On the low couch, Sabiha shifted her scarf, the knot under her chin neat as a signature, and watched her granddaughter with one clouded eye that roamed and one sharp eye that had never missed a chance to tuck truth under the edge of a tablecloth when guests came.\n\n\u201cYou smell of salt and someone else\u2019s kitchen,\u201d Zeynep said, sliding olives from their bath into a bowl with a speed that feared interruption, then kissing her teeth as if the salt had spoken out of turn. \u201cEat and then we will see what you have brought back that you should not have and what you lost that you will pretend you never wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought back the wind in a better mood,\u201d Leyla said, which was both true and the kind of sentence that made her mother sigh because it did not solve anything you could put on a shelf. She did not take out the ring. She did not touch it. She took bread and broke it, and the steam climbed her face with the mild possessiveness of an old friend who pretends not to be surprised you have returned alive.\n\n\u201cYou left me with milk that fought the pot and a neighbor who came to complain about her husband\u2019s snoring as if I am the registrar for other people\u2019s foolishness,\u201d Sabiha put in, her spoon already busy with cheese as if it had been built to translate dairy into bruises and triumphs. \u201cThe needle stayed awake last night. It pricked me for being bored. Something has turned its face the right way, k\u0131z\u0131m. If you tell me you did nothing, I will spit, and you know my spitting works.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nazars in the market faced the wall last time,\u201d Leyla said, watching the way tea made a light when poured from a height and thinking that perhaps everything she owned should be taught to arc without spilling. \u201cToday they will remember what their eyes are for. We go to the well.\u201d\n\nThey did not hurry because the village did not respect haste unless it involved stoves, lambing, or rumors. On the street, children made stones into worlds and the world into a stone; the old men on the bench under the fig tree pretended to be uninterested in the weather and then debated lodos with a scholarship that would have put proper teachers to shame. Yasemin walked beside Leyla with that manipulable brightness that had carried them through rooms that refused laughter. She had the Sab\u0131r stone in her pocket like a new pact; it sat against her thigh and made a gentle weight that taught her to stop lifting one shoulder in impatience at the sound of other people chewing. \u201cYour mother will not forgive me if we make a scene,\u201d she said solemnly, then flashed her teeth because forgiveness and scene-making were two foods she had survived on for years.\n\nPer\u015fembe Pazar\u0131 had shrugged on its necessary confusion. Hasan, sleeves rolled, hair a thesis on how to make sunlight behave, leaned into his stall with more swagger than he had change for and greeted them as if they had been gone a season, not a handful of days. \u201cYou left,\u201d he said, putting two figs aside with a flourish he hoped looked accidental, \u201cand the figs sulked. They arrived this morning to apologize. I told them the witches had returned and they feigned eating their shame, which is to say they sat there and looked edible.\u201d His smile faltered the smallest degree when the string of blue glass eyes behind him creaked and turned outward with the confidence of a guest who finally understands which direction the door is. \u201cAllah Allah,\u201d he breathed, then slapped the counter as if flattering an animal into obedience. \u201cYou bring me luck or you bring me trouble, cad\u0131. Either way, I will sell out of tomatoes and pretend it was skill.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need ribbon,\u201d Leyla said, and Hasan\u2019s cousin, who had a box of everything that could tie and a knowledge of exactly how long each piece should be for every occasion including funerals and baby showers and goats that refused their pegs, slid bundles across the counter. They took silk the color of old leaves that refuse to fall, and stout cotton the shade of kitchen tile at dusk, and a roll of something that had once been upholstery and now wanted redemption. \u201cAnd rope,\u201d Yasemin added, \u201cfor men who will swear they did not ask to be tied to our cause and then will wail when we leave them to wander into ditches of their own building.\u201d Hasan wrapped the ribbons neatly, then ruined the neatness by tucking in a paper twist of walnuts when no one was looking and told himself he had been forced.\n\nHoca Celal met them at the lip of the well with that long-suffering look he wore when his faith in order was being asked to sit on a small stool and watch women rearrange the furniture. He had in his hand a book he clearly did not intend to open and a bundle of mint he clearly did. The wives at the well, skirts tucked, arms bare to the elbow, eyed the gathering with the useful suspicion of people who have yet to be convinced that a ritual will make their laundry easier. The circle of stones breathed up its cool breath; if you bent close you could smell somewhere far down the deep, a bitter resin smell like a secret trade. The wrong rainbow was gone and not gone. When you glanced, it had corrected itself; when you looked hard, you saw odd bands shifting places like cousins stealing one another\u2019s shoes. A woman who had lost a ring last year under the quince tree and had sworn she would never stop cursing until the ring returned, turned her face away from Leyla out of superstition and then turned it back out of curiosity because no one had the patience to cling to their own curses these days.\n\n\u201cWe will not pour anything into the water,\u201d Leyla said softly, because the well had a temper that respected soft voices and mocked loud ones. \u201cWe will not put gum or glue or even good intentions. We will comb the air above it so it remembers how to part and rejoin. We will hang a braid across its mouth so that what should pass does and what should linger is made to admit its motive. We will ask for names. We will feed the names back in their proper shape instead of letting them sink and ferment into bad advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is new,\u201d Celal said, and he was not being sarcastic; he was placing his mind where it belonged, at the angle where questions do not look like weapons. \u201cTeach me where to stand so I do not cast a shadow where a woman\u2019s hands are working.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will hold the mint,\u201d Yasemin told him, putting him to useful work before his intellect could invent a problem, \u201cand you will scold anyone who tries to spit. And if the stone grumbles, you will say, \u2018Eyvallah, elder,\u2019 and mean it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEyvallah,\u201d he said obediently, and the word fit his mouth like an old step fits a foot.\n\nThey braided at the edge of the circle, not to bind, not to fence, but to lay over like the shawls Sabiha wore when winter thought it would get its way. Silk lay against cotton against the stubborn strip that had been meant for sofas and now pleased itself by being a threshold. As they measured, walking around the well until their feet knew the circumference better than their heads, the village brought offerings that were not offerings but the daily turned holy because of how it arrived. A child brought two white stones and the conviction that one had been invaluable to him yesterday and that he could live without it today. A boy brought an old marble from his father\u2019s boyhood, nicked and too large for modern games. A woman set down a lemon slice and then changed her mind, lifted it, kissed it, and returned it to her pocket because some acids belong to the pot. A man brought nothing and then, embarrassed, took off the ring that had worn his finger thin where his mother had measured his adulthood by whether he wore it and set it lightly on the stone for one breath before reclaiming it, which was enough.\n\n\u201cSay their names,\u201d Leyla asked, and the saying began at the edges and then caught. They did not pour names down the well as if names were trash to be blinded; they said them into the braided air. Names have flight. Names know when they are welcomed as guests and when they are being asked to behave like laundry. Women said the names of their children with that elaborate simplicity that contains all sorrows that have not happened yet. Old men said the names of their brothers and pretended not to taste the war in their own mouths. Hasan said his grandmother\u2019s name and then, loud enough to be teased, the name of a woman who had not yet agreed to scold him for the rest of his life. The boys stole each other\u2019s names as jokes and the names returned home with muddy knees and grass stains and a promise to wash.\n\nWhen the wind, which had rushed ahead of itself on the plateau like a goat unsupervised, came to the lip of the well and found the braid, it hesitated in the way a bully hesitates before good manners and a chair and a woman who will not move her knee. Leyla lifted Feride\u2019s comb and held it above the mouth, the olive teeth catching light like simple instruments made by men who loved wood more than they loved women or God. She dragged the comb through nothing and everything both, and the air separated by the width of patience, which is neither wide nor narrow but exactly the shape of what it must allow. The first pass whispered; the second pass spoke. The third pass opened a place where the wrong rainbow relaxed its shoulders and remembered to be a trick of light and not a signature of grief.\n\n\u201cHaydi,\u201d Leyla said, and the word, which in other mouths means hurry, arrived here as a permission to proceed with dignity. The water in the well did not froth and did not make a show. It acknowledged in the small way old water does: a release of two bubbles like a child waking and deciding not to cry, and the faintest ripple that betrayed a current below accepting a new habit. Celal breathed out and let the mint cool his tongue and said nothing because sometimes a hoca\u2019s best work is to be quiet where women can hear their own yes.\n\nSomeone down the lane yelled because a goat had found the bag of flour left like a dare on the doorstep, and laughter made a quick rain across the square because there are disasters you are allowed to enjoy. A tourist couple tried to photograph the well and failed, not because magic dislikes being seen, but because the air does not love strangers more than it loves the old women who have carried it in and out of houses long enough to make it behave. Sabiha had taken her chair to the shade and threaded a needle without theater, then threaded it again when it refused to be honest, and was nodding to herself like a queen when the stitch went clean without a knot on the backside. \u201cWakefulness suits us,\u201d she announced to her own lap, and then louder so that the well could hear and stop sulking. \u201cThe needle remembered. The day is in its place.\u201d\n\nThey hung the braid and left it to speak above the stones in a voice that would not make itself hoarse. Children were allowed to touch it if they did not tug. Men who joked at it were reminded to behave themselves by looks that women had perfected over centuries of reminding and rarely needing to resort to hitting. On the way to the market for bread that had not yet lost its right to be called bread, the nazars along the lane blinked outward and dared flies to like themselves. Oil dripped from a simit that had been bitten with the greed of someone who had not eaten since the news returned that their village was still exactly here. The fig in Hasan\u2019s hand was the precise measure of ripeness that convinces a person they are loved by a universe that made bees first and opinions last. He licked his thumb dramatically and then stopped performing because sometimes food requires you to be sincere. He pushed a fig into Yasemin\u2019s palm and did not pretend it was free. She took it and did not pretend she was doing him a favor by accepting.\n\nAt noon the wind tried a trick it had learned in the city. It threw its shoulder against the top of the lane to create a little storm that would make laundry slap itself silly on lines and minds refuse to settle for the quiet that comes after the midday call. The braid at the well made a low sound like a woman telling a secret you already know and reminding you to act surprised for courtesy\u2019s sake. The dust came and then found itself embarrassed and went into corners and tried to change the subject. The goats acknowledged the moment by lifting their heads and then, finding nothing delicious in it, returned to their chewing with the kind of contempt only goats and bureaucrats can perfect. The bread in Zeynep\u2019s kitchen did not stale before its time. The lemons sat without commentary. The pot behaved. The neighbor with the snoring husband decided to fold her laundry twice instead of beginning a new complaint.\n\nIn the library Celal set his book down open on a verse he had always misread as an order and now realized was an invitation. He touched the page the way he had touched the mint, with homogeneous reverence. The line that used to mean \u201cstop\u201d gentled itself into \u201cstay.\u201d He scribbled in the margin as if his own handwriting could be forgiven for deciding not to be a weapon today. He had expected to be the repository of what had happened, a clean jar labeled and placed on an appropriate shelf. He found instead that he was a window, and that the work of being a window is exhausting and holy and it makes a man grateful for women who invent curtains that do not darken the room.\n\nThe day, having been prevented from becoming melodramatic, proceeded with a competence that made people forget to be grateful until they lay down and found themselves surprised by how little their heads hurt. Hasan shorted himself one ring of simit by giving it to a child who did not ask; later he would swear the ledger corrected itself when he blinked, and Zeynep would snort and say he was an optimist and a liar. A hen laid an egg in the exact spot where the children had buried a coin under a stone last year and forgotten it; the egg did not break and the coin was recovered, and no one called it a sign because signs are a habit that eats time you need for cooking. Sabiha took a nap that did not invite ancient conversations to sit on her chest. She dreamed of a river without the embarrassment of a city sitting on it, a river that only wanted to be river, and she woke and said aloud for the benefit of anyone who would fold her words into later decisions, \u201cGood. Let the water be wise in its own small way.\u201d\n\nIn the evening, with the day\u2019s heat shambling off into the low ravines to gossip with sunset about goats and bread, they tried the comb on the village fountain. There was no marble, only stone that had learned six different decades of hands and believed itself to be more generous than it had been last week. Men with tea cups stood at an angle that suggested they were too polite to stare and too honest to pretend they were not curious. Leyla held the comb at a height no one could call sacrilegious and drew it through the falling water in a measured stroke that promised to close wounds without leaving a scar to be admired. The fountain did not freeze; it forgot, briefly, that it had spent all day moving, then remembered, then laughed in the only way a fountain can laugh, which is by splashing a woman who did not intend to be splashed and making children shriek because they have internal barometers for joy. The sound of the water changed, not by much, only enough that the flirtation it had been conducting with gravity since morning acquired a respect that would last through the hard hours before dawn.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Zeynep said calmly, and that gentle authority that had prevented ten thousand small disasters from becoming large took hold of the air. She wiped the splash from her daughter\u2019s cheek with the corner of her apron and failed to scold. \u201cIf the fountain is going to laugh, let it do it outside where there is space for foolishness. My stove is for sobriety.\u201d\n\nThat night there was no dream of a garden. There was the kind of sleep that comes like a committee of unheard-of saints and sits in the corners and agrees that for once, nothing terrible needs to be planned. There was the settling of the house into its ordinary joints. There was the ring in the pocket that pulsed and then chose to be quiet like a guest who could either call attention or do the beautiful work of not needing to be seen. There was the sensation of reprieve, which is not the same as salvation and often kinder. In a city far off that had grown its own mouth, a woman with leaves crawling up her windows wrote two sentences in a notebook she had been too proud to touch for too long, and then tore the page out and burned it, not because the sentences were bad, but because she did not want anyone to read them improperly and think her heart was made of simple clay.\n\nThe morning caught the village with its hair in its mouth and could not decide whether to laugh or call for mothers. The braid over the well had settled, silk waiting for someone to invent a reason to stroke it. Children who could be trusted to fetch water without rearranging the world were sent with jugs and disciplinary glances; they returned with cheeks like polished apples and the serious air of citizens entrusted with a country. Men exhaled and sat in their own chairs without pretending they had earned them that morning; women let their hands be briefly empty and allowed one another to see it. Leyla went to Hoca Celal with two papers from the balcony in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar and laid them down on the table without the apology untrained artists make when they present their first failures. The marblings had dried into their own minds, messy and dignified. He set his spectacles on his nose and let the color talk to him about a language he might never speak and would anyway impose on students later with the gentleness he saved for the young and the breakable.\n\n\u201cYou made one door in the city and one here,\u201d he said after a long minute during which he had considered whether it was polite to be moved in front of girls you had taught to read under the table. \u201cDo you intend to keep it open forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leyla said, and was grateful to hear the certainty arrive without her having to go looking. \u201cDoors are for movement, not for bragging. We open and close. We will not build a museum of our accomplishments and trap the day inside. We will go to Hasan and buy figs for the old woman whose teeth will not cooperate and we will mash them with walnuts and say we invented medicine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u015eifa went,\u201d he observed, not reaching for the stone she did not have. \u201cHe was the right person to carry it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a name we did not know we had,\u201d she said, and the pleasure of discovering that a decision had been good sat down in her throat where sarcasm usually kept its chair. \u201cThere will be more. The city is a pocketful waiting to be counted. Konya has its own pockets. You are not the only careful person hiding thread.\u201d\n\nThey were interrupted by the boy who looked as if everything that had ever happened had been his idea. He came to the library door with a reluctance that betrayed an old-fashioned respect stitched along the edges of a new, cheap arrogance. \u201cHoca,\u201d he called, then saw Leyla and corrected himself with a theater that made her want to clap. \u201cAblam. The nazars at the mosque turned and then turned back and then turned again, and the imam says if we are going to keep them dizzy, we should at least give them tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive the nazars tea,\u201d Celal said gravely, nodding until he had convinced himself he had always intended to be this ridiculous and that it did not diminish him. \u201cAnd turn them yourself with your two hands, with the understanding that you are agreeing to carry a little of what they carry for as long as they look outward. Do not do things to people you will not do for yourself. That includes beads, stones, and wives.\u201d\n\nThe boy puffed at the last word and looked sideways at Leyla as if expecting her to be the sort of woman who thinks putting men in their place is a sport without risk. She spared him and walked out with her palms open like a person whose hands are clean. At the mosque wall the eyes hung, a string of sky, the blue worn by fingers and sun into a true color, deep as the kind of ocean no one in the village had seen. She reached and steadied them, not turning them as you turn an argument, but righting them as you right a cup that has tipped because someone laughed and knocked it and did not mean harm. They faced the street with their unblinking courtesy. She let her fingers rest a second longer than habit, as if telling a frightened child, \u201cBak, I am here. Be useful.\u201d\n\nBy the week\u2019s end the village had organized itself around the fact that the wind had been taught a new trick and could be made to like it. The women began, with grudging smiles, to copy Zeynep\u2019s braided threshold across courtyards and front rooms and stables; the first few were crooked and hung with a humility that made children proud of them as if they had drawn them on walls with chalk. Men claimed they had invented the ribbons because men cannot resist inventing anything that can be twisted and knotted, and women allowed them to talk until they forgot what they had claimed and then quietly fixed the knots to hold. The well, which had been in a mood for a season as if it had eaten the wrong mushrooms at a festival, stayed civil. The water had a new taste that no one could name because it belonged to no fruit and no flower; it tasted like a day that would not be hijacked by a sound from far away.\n\nAt dusk one night the wind tried to bring dust from the lower fields where the new machine had bitten and spat and left the earth with its hair cut wrong. The braid hummed. The first grains lifted in their habitual caravan and then dropped, embarrassed to be caught without elegance. Goats with opinions stood on vantage points and bleated as if delivering judgment; a woman in a doorway laughed at them and told them to come down before they imagined themselves eagles and leaped. A small disaster\u2014two boys and a red bicycle\u2014attempted to learn gravity among the lanes and failed to get hurt, and a grandmother sitting under a pomegranate tree nodded once in the way of people who know the cost of luck and never spend it all in one place.\n\nIt did not last without friction. An aunt with a stubborn mouth came to Zeynep and said the house had begun to move in the night and she did not trust houses that move; she preferred men that move and houses that keep their promises. A cousin insisted the braid was ugly and hung like the tongue of a dog who has run too far to be trusted with a baby. A man announced at the tea garden that if women would discuss these matters with proper authorities instead of talking to each other as if they were the authorities, the world would be fewer headaches and more towels folded with the edge facing the same direction. Hasan whispered to the man that if he wanted his tomatoes to sell with pride, he should wait to be asked about color and sweetness instead of announcing them; the man pretended to take offense and then sold three kilos in five minutes to women who wanted to reward him for the effort.\n\nThat evening at the fountain, a stranger bent and drank and then looked at the water with that wide-eyed confusion city people practice when they discover that real taste exists in places without menus. His hair was overconfident; his shoes were tired; he put his palm on the broad stone and closed his eyes like a man listening to a song he had not paid for. He was the kind of person who might be harmless if he could be taught to be grateful on time. Yasemin watched him with one eyebrow lifted into a position that promised he would not be allowed to tell her who she was, and he lowered his gaze as if to suggest he had manners in a drawer somewhere and would get them if necessary. He drank again and nodded to the fountain, a gesture of such unshowy politeness that she withheld her scolding and allowed him to be new here without being a nuisance. He did not stay. He walked away before anyone could ask the question everyone asks when new mouths show up in old places.\n\nAt the end of that week, when Friday came and the air dressed itself in a clean shirt and pretended it had not been pestering widows and molds, Hoca Celal found Leyla under the rope swing with the cedar throwing good shade like alms. He had laughter folded in his pocket and did not take it out. \u201cCome,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will teach the old book a new pace. Your Esmeray\u2014do not argue with me about possession; language is a goat\u2014wearies. She will write when the lodos leaves her kitchen. She should write. It will fret her into health. In the meantime, we can decide how to keep men from telling this tale like a bottle smashed and a miracle in which they provided the neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy letting them feel some of the work,\u201d she said, standing with the reluctance of a person whose body had begun to insist on its rights and could not always be dismissed with a joke. \u201cWe will ask them to hang braids. We will ask them to comb air without getting drunk on it. We will ask them to wash the comb. We will ask them to hold the mint.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your mother will ask you to scrub the pans properly and not put anything sticky where ants could take it for an invitation to the conquest of the kitchen,\u201d he added with relish, because teasing Zeynep when she was not present was safer and sometimes necessary to remind himself he could still do delight without turning pious.\n\nThey walked to the well because all walking there now and then had the decency to pass by that center, as if the village had been given a new spine and was learning how to carry itself. The braid had collected dust and the oily touch of fingers, not as dirt, but as a record of who had believed in it with hands. Leyla smoothed it and it smoothed her. She took out the notebook R\u0131za had given her and wrote the names of those who had shown up unasked this week\u2014the boy with the knot he had failed to tie and proudly presented; the woman with the pigeon feather stuck in her hair who had not bothered to remove it because it did not disgrace her; the man who carried two water jugs for his neighbor because his back had not yet learned betrayal and he thought showing off might encourage it to stay loyal. She wrote them not as labels, but as words that would later be prayers whether or not anyone agreed to a mosque or a kitchen for their uttering.\n\nOn the fifth morning, the wind woke the village like a mother who has already brewed tea and will not fight to get people out of bed. It hummed through the braid and made a sound like a woman threading a needle and finding the hole obliges her without her having to squint too tight. In Istanbul a woman with leaves for drapes stood and did not tidy anything and did not demand perfection and did not hate herself for one long minute. On the Galata steps, the woman who spat offered the wind her gratitude again, and this time, uncharacteristically, she did not spit, because sometimes you move the offering from your mouth to your chest and the gods do not mind the change. In Konya, R\u0131za laughed into an empty room and did not tell anyone why because the day already had enough work.\n\nBy noon clouds gathered along the edge of the plateau with that ridiculous pomp with which they like to announce flourishes in a land that has planed itself kindly to make movement easier for goats and women carrying water. Dust thought about performing. Men looked up as if to say, go ahead then, do your worst, and dust, humiliated by the casual invitation, decided to take its tantrum elsewhere. The braid over the well shivered once the way a child shivers when its parents speak suddenly of bed, then settled, as if being a threshold had become an achieved habit. Leyla\u2019s palm burned suddenly, not in warning, but in recognition; the ring in her pocket had heated with a decisiveness that made her mouth water as if she had put a coin under her tongue. She took it out and held it flat in her hand. The carnelian\u2019s crack was merely stone and also a very thin path that light never forgot to take. The letters inside, which would not hold still long enough to be owned, rolled and then rolled back like sea and set their backs against the red as if saying, not yet.\n\nShe did not put the ring on. She pressed it to the stone lip of the well, not to return it, not to claim it, to let the circle greet another circle and see if they admired each other without malice. The well did not reply with drama. It acknowledged with a coolness that said, I am older than all your grandmothers. Move or do not move. Pray or do not pray. But behave. She lifted the ring and slipped it into her pocket with the ordinary motion of a housewife returning change to the purse deep inside the cupboard so no one could find it until she wanted them to.\n\nIn the evening, under a sky that was neither bruise nor boast, they made bread on the flat griddle, the kind that is meant to be rolled thinner than sorrow and thicker than rules. The wind behaved like a fan a girl in summer chooses to hold\u2014not because it cools, but because it gives the hand something to do while waiting for the fruit to sweeten. The neighbors came and pretended not to wait for an invitation; the men brought gossip and were thanked for it as if it were sugar; the children were made to sit and eat long after they insisted they were not hungry, and all of them managed to feel that they had gotten their way. Sabiha told a story about her sister\u2019s wedding that contradicted her own story from last year in two crucial places, and no one mentioned it because perhaps this version pleased the night better. When they had finished and the pans blinked in the low light and forgave themselves for having been dirty, Zeynep, who had worked all day to maintain civil relations among the elements, put her hands in her lap and allowed them to be seen like that, empty and heavy. \u201cWe will live,\u201d she said, as if annoyed to be forced into optimism by the facts. \u201cWe will live and I will scold you because you must wear a scarf when the wind behaves like a man who has come into a room he was not invited to.\u201d\n\nWhen the house slept, the well dreamed because it could, and the village slept because it trusted its own doors. The comb on the shelf learned contentment and did not ask to order the air while people dreamed; it had learned that to be useful at all hours is to be used up before spring. The braid barely moved and did not complain. The nazars faced outward and felt no need to blink ostentatiously. On the road past the gypsum cliffs a truck rumbled like an animal that misunderstands its own weight and thinks it gentle; the dust lifted three centimeters and then put itself back down, disabused of its romance for this particular dance. In \u00dcsk\u00fcdar the woman with leaves rolled out dough on a counter not entirely clean and did not die of it. In Konya, R\u0131za woke and laughed before coffee and insulted God with tenderness, which is prayer in a dialect no one wants to codify.\n\nThe next day, which belonged to no market and no saint, brought a boy to the well who had been born with a streak of panic where other children have a streak of boredom. He came, knees dusty, hair slicked with the hands of other boys who believed grooming should look like kindness, and stood on tiptoe and looked down as if expecting dragons or an aunt he had lost three years ago and still could not grieve because he had been too busy surviving. \u201cAblam,\u201d he asked without turning his head because children believe questions are owned by the air and not the person who answers them, \u201cif we drop our names into the water, do they drown.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you drop them like stones,\u201d Leyla said, kneeling so their eyes met and her voice did not have to climb, \u201cthey will sit on the bottom and sulk and frighten fish. If you lay them down like bread on a table and say \u2018buyurun,\u2019 they will feed something. Do you have a name you wish to feed.\u201d\n\nHe frowned, chewing the idea, then shook his head with a maturity that had no business on that small neck. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want one ready for the day I forget.\u201d He put his hand on the braid and the braid remembered that hands had made it and, for the first time since it had been hung, it purred.\n\nBy late afternoon news came up the slope with a kind of civilized haste: a storm at the edge of the plain had torn a slope and worried four roofs and made Yasemin\u2019s uncle swear in inventive and unusable ways. The village squared itself as if for a photograph of dignity. Women pulled in carpets as if catching children by the hems. Men took down satellite dishes they would later pretend had never been important to them. The wind arrived and then failed to be a guest we despise. The braid caught the first eagerness and re-apportioned it to the corners. The comb hung on its peg and did not lunge because it had learned it was not a weapon and was relieved to retire from war. The well, old to the point of being uninterested in the performance of weather, held its cool and did not take another fish hostage or spit out old rings to distract the village from its chores.\n\nNight\u2019s first hour rarely tells the truth about the day. It lies and says all has been well, or it performs for the window that thinks it was necessary. This night told the truth. It set itself down, a little crooked, and let itself be corrected by the yawns of people who would not be bullied into staying awake. Leyla sat with the notebook and finally wrote a line worth showing to someone who cannot be trusted to leave well enough alone. She hoped Hoca would read it and nod and then pretend to disagree; she hoped R\u0131za would read it and drink water and say \u201cHah,\u201d in a way that made the line taller. She wrote the names of the stones they had kept and the weight she had given away at the water and the bird who had thanked her by pecking its man and making him laugh like coin dropped into a plate at a wedding. She did not write Esmeray. She kept that name between her teeth where a woman keeps too much and therefore survives.\n\nThe following day the road from the city sent them a woman with a scarf tied in a way that came from the Black Sea like a piece of music, and she set a heavy bag down by Hasan\u2019s stall and said she was looking for the witch who had combed the well into good behavior because she had a son who loved fish only when they were alive and a husband who loved fish only when they were not and a house that had stopped cooking because the difference exhausted it. Hasan sent her to Zeynep because Zeynep had never been afraid of being the registrar for other people\u2019s foolishness even when she pretended she would not fill out the forms. \u201cSit,\u201d Zeynep told the woman, pouring tea as if tea were an apology that always arrived on time in this house, and then looked up at her daughter with a face that suggested she did not mind that the story had gotten out of their yard and into people\u2019s mouths. \u201cWash your hands,\u201d she added, because the day was not allowed to forget its dignity.\n\nThey kept the braid. They combed the fountain now and then, not to boss it, to remind it. They asked the nazars to face outward and to accept the duty with the kind of gravity reserved for old men and certain kinds of bread. They made small doorways in places where draft and complaint had been wrestling for years and told draft and complaint to behave themselves and consider marriage. They roped nothing and tied no one, and when men accused them of having banned something, they nodded and said \u201cEvet,\u201d with the bored audacity of women who have more important work than keeping score. The goats continued to escape their pegs and find the exact produce that had been counted and priced to the last coin and make pranks out of their mouths, and they were forgiven and scolded and forgiven again because stubbornness is a resource to be hoarded and spent carefully.\n\nOne late afternoon, when the sound of the call caught a flock in flight and made them rethink the route they had claimed, a letter arrived, not by pigeon, not by post, by a woman\u2019s breath. It came into the kitchen while the onions were being coaxed into honorable humility. It curled itself around the notch above Leyla\u2019s sternum and sat there until she stopped pretending to be busy and listened. It said nothing useful\u2014no instructions, no map, no appointment\u2014but it carried the smell of ivy warmed by late sun and a new, shy, honest scent of paper that had seen ink and not burned. It said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d in a tone that lovers have used to save themselves and those they love from being ridiculous, and \u201cSoon,\u201d in the tone of women who will not permit \u201csoon\u201d to be a cudgel. She did not tell anyone at the table; she salted the onions, and the onions surrendered, and the kitchen agreed for the length of a recipe to hold its disparate griefs and satisfactions in one hand like herbs and not let them slip.\n\nOn Sunday Zeynep took the lemon out and cut it with that old exactness that had convinced everyone in this house they were safe. The light cut through the yellow and came out on the other side as if it had done this before. She lifted the half and held it under her daughter\u2019s nose and said, \u201cBak. This is what comes of staying alive,\u201d and Leyla laughed because sometimes a mother picks a fruit and hands it to you like a diploma, and you accept because to refuse would be an offense against something older than any story anyone here will ever dare to write down and hide under a pillow. They ate with dirty fingers. They did not wait for anything to be approved by the city. They let the wind come in. They did not apologize when it complimented the curtains and then went out again to see if anyone needed combing.",

The rock towers hunched and leaned and peered over the salt flats, taking in the hush before the muezzin\u2019s voice braided the darkness with morning. Leyla stood on a smooth ridge of ignimbrite, her palms open to the sky, and whispered to the wind. It was never dramatic with her\u2014no thunderclap, no flying. The magic came as breath does; it came as the cooling of stone under her bare feet, as a small flicker in the corner of the world where anyone else would blame the eye.\n\n\u201cGel,\u201d she said, not because she thought the wind knew Turkish, but because the syllable cut her tongue cleanly enough to let whatever was galloping through her blood tumble out. She felt it like she always did, an agreement with something older than her family, older than the praying caves riddling the cliffs: the wind pulled, spun once, brushed her face and left the taste of copper.\n\nShe watched it lift a pinch of dust and set it down again at the edge of a cracked pool. Good, she thought, soft. No glare of flame, no sudden slicing cold. Soft was what she liked. She had no taste for hot, for conquest, for the kind of power that made you a story on the dust of a jug. She blew into her cupped hands, so faint it might have been a sigh. The salt water hushed, a wrinkle smoothing itself. A white moth that had slept under a blade of grass now woke and twitched as if it remembered wings. In a little while, people would walk here, to the wells and the fields, and they would say in the clipped tongue of the village that the day felt lighter. They would say it without looking at her. That was also the way she liked it.\n\n\u201cLeyla!\u201d The low shout unhooked her from the hush. She turned to see Yasemin climbing the hill, a scarf twisted around her wrist like ivy. Yasemin\u2019s hair was a home for sunlight, it made no sense; she had looked like a summer the year she turned ten and she looked like a summer now, at twenty.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re up with cinler.\u201d Yasemin crouched, panting, and then, with the economy that came from practice, tied her shoes tight with a jolt that bit the laces into obedience. \u201cMy mother will blame me if she finds the milk on the stove turned. She says I attract nonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe milk curdles because you flirt with it.\u201d Leyla smiled. She tried not to show the exhilaration that still moved like a bird inside her. \u201cYou smile and it thinks it\u2019s yogurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the witch,\u201d Yasemin said, and rolled her eyes. \u201cCome, teyze will worry. Babaanne was asking for you yesterday. She says the sky blinked three times, that the Nazar fell asleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cBabaanne says the needle falls asleep and it\u2019s an omen if she can\u2019t thread it in one try.\u201d But she felt it, the way an old boat feels the grain of the water. She could pretend she didn\u2019t know but she did. Something had been rubbing the edges of the day raw, and now the village air had the taste of a story the day before it was told.\n\nThey walked together down through the chimneys where tourists would come later to take pictures and pretend that they were alone in a place that had waited only for them. The rope swing that Zeynep\u2019s nephew had hung from a cedar smelled of dust and cypress resin. A shepherd on the slope cut through the morning with his flute and the goats became dots moving across the brown field like seeds on bread.\n\nAt the gate, the pomegranate tree bowed. Leyla touched the trunk, thumb to sap, palm to roughness, and her mother\u2019s voice rose through the kitchen window: \u201cElini y\u0131ka! Breakfast.\u201d\n\nZeynep had already filled the low table with bowls that adder-wrapped around each other, olives black and green, tomatoes cut so that the middle held a star of juice, a plate of beyaz peynir sweating faintly in the heat of the room, and bread. Always bread: a crust with hairline cracks, as if it had been kissed by the map of the fields.\n\n\u201cGel, k\u0131z\u0131m.\u201d Zeynep caught her by the wrist, that mother-grip that saw everything and had its own history. \u201cYou\u2019ve been walking again?\u201d She kissed the spot on Leyla\u2019s forehead where worries sometimes alighted. \u201cYou smell like stone. Sit.\u201d\n\nBabaanne Sabiha had been quiet that morning; her clouded left eye did its wandering, the right eye watched with a cunning that proved she was not yet entirely lost to more ancient conversations. She wore her scarf tied under the chin, the old women\u2019s tie that held secrets tight.\n\n\u201cTell me your dream, Leyla.\u201d Sabiha\u2019s voice snuck like a cat under the table, and Yasemin bit into a piece of cucumber, the crunch satisfying as a fable well told.\n\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d Leyla poured strong tea into tulip glasses and remembered to lift the pot high to arc the mahogany. \u201cI always dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one where you woke with your breath crossed,\u201d Sabiha said. \u201cYou came to the yard and fed the chickens with your slippers on the wrong feet.\u201d\n\nZeynep laughed, but it caught on a nail of worry. \u201cThat was last week. She woke to the ezan, confused. Or she pretended to be, to get out of going to the shop for flour.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t pretend.\u201d Leyla folded her bread around a wedge of cheese, as if protection could be eaten. She put the first bite in her mouth and let salt and softness mingle on her tongue so she could think. \u201cIt\u2019s the same, mostly. A house of leaves. A window with a green view but the green is too loud. A woman who speaks and the words are thick with honey and you don\u2019t want to swallow them but she keeps talking. She knows my name. She says, come and see how I have fed the fountains.\u201d\n\nSabiha\u2019s spoon paused over the olives. \u201cA house of leaves. H\u0131.\u201d She sucked her teeth, an old music. \u201cAnd the fountains?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey run with wine in the dream.\u201d Leyla shrugged. \u201cI wake thirsty.\u201d\n\nYasemin\u2019s laugh pinged off the copper pans. \u201cSign me up, witch. A fountain of wine? Sabiha nine, you taught her to dream like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think you sign up for dreams like for a line at the bakkal?\u201d Sabiha\u2019s eye sharpened. \u201cK\u0131z. There are places where water runs sweet and thick at the same time and to drink is to promise. There are women who feed gardens with our names. They call out the ones with old blood. Sometimes they call to steal. Sometimes to make a song.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Zeynep said, but she looked at her mother and at her daughter and the bread tore in her hand like a fragile map of worry torn across nowhere. \u201cEat. Work. Pray. Go to the market and help Hasan. He keeps giving away simit to girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe gives me dried apricots,\u201d Yasemin said. \u201cNo one gives away simit.\u201d\n\nNo one gave away what mattered. That was something Leyla had learned early, when her father left for Istanbul with a pack of electricians and then stopped sending money or letters or the brittle postcards that folded like a complicated apology. People who said they loved you always had a stop under their feet like a trapdoor; they could vanish and call it rescue.\n\nShe washed the dishes with her mother, the soap cool and the plates refusing bubbles in that stubborn way of good ceramics. She slipped her hands into rinse water and felt, far away, under the bones of her wrists, a low thrum. It was like the steady distant drum of a festival you don\u2019t remember being invited to. She looked up and the room tilted left like a gondola might, if it decided to dream of the sea beyond everything.\n\n\u201cLeyla?\u201d Zeynep\u2019s hand on her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re somewhere else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thinking of the market.\u201d She set a glass to dry. \u201cYasemin, shall we go? Before the sun eats us.\u201d\n\nPer\u015fembe Pazar\u0131 sat under planes of blue like an accidental poem. The stalls were swollen with vegetables, the shade nets thrown the way fishermen throw their hope onto the water to see what bites. The smell of bread, of hard soap, of dusty seeds waiting for spring\u2014these were the village\u2019s breath.\n\nHasan stood behind his counter with the confident slouch of a man whose family had owned that patch of olive-scented wood longer than anyone cared to measure. His shirt said \u201cNo problem!\u201d in English that didn\u2019t know it was either weary or aggressive. He brightened when the girls came and slid a paper bag of apricots across the slope of his scale.\n\n\u201cMy treat, witches,\u201d he said. The word was a shape he repeated because he liked to hear himself make it. \u201cTake and remember your humble greengrocer when you are famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll conjure you a wife out of eggshells and garlic,\u201d Yasemin said. \u201cShe will cook and scold in one breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlhamdulillah,\u201d he said, then blinked, because irony sat badly on him. \u201cWhat do you need today?\u201d\n\n\u201cFlour. Salt. A bit of cumin.\u201d Leyla leaned into the shade, grateful to pause between the press of people and the sunlight. \u201cThe new figs are late.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be here when they\u2019re ready.\u201d Hasan tied his bag with a twist practiced by hands that had learned to do three things at once. \u201cLike the rain.\u201d\n\nOn the edge of hearing, something cracked. It was tiny, an eggshell in a wide house. The blue beads on the string behind Hasan, the nazars that had watched a thousand transactions, all swung at once. For a moment\u2014only that\u2014they faced inward, the eyes turning to the wall. Hasan, superstitious in the way of men who would deny superstition while refusing to let Knives lie blade-up, swore. \u201cAllah Allah\u2026\u201d\n\nLeyla\u2019s skin prickled. A wind ran the lanes, catching scarves, making plastic bags tumble like poor ghosts. It stopped before it reached her. The stop itself was what felt wrong. The wind\u2019s habit was to skim and spin and then go; it had never braked in front of her like a horse smelling fire.\n\n\u201cLeyla.\u201d She turned to find Hoca Celal behind a stack of crates, his long fingers reflected in the metal of his spectacles. He wasn\u2019t often in the market; he belonged to the library that clung to a corner of the mosque like a remora. He was the one who had slipped her a book of Sufi poets with paper-thin pages when she was fourteen; he was the one who had said, \u201cYour heart knows the steps.\u201d He did not smile now. \u201cCome by when you\u2019re done. Bring the same palms you brought yesterday. We have work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat work?\u201d Yasemin snapped a grape and Lid of water popped open and spilled across the table, \u201cShe\u2019s not your apprentice, hoca.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right.\u201d He inclined his head to her, eyes soft. \u201cI am hers.\u201d\n\nHe left like a sentence that no one had the patience to finish.\n\nOn her way to the library later, she passed the well. The circle of stones breathed cool air as if it had a throat and a set of lungs like any village elder. The surface glimmered, a little oil slick making a rainbow handshake if you looked too hard. Leyla did look and the rainbow\u2019s bands rearranged themselves into a different order, violet where orange should be, a wrong that was too pretty not to note. She felt the interruption in her spine. The well had a story tomorrow. Today it was writing.\n\nThe library smelled like paper that had known rain and forgiven it, and of the old wood of shelves that had straightened men\u2019s backs without their consent. Hoca Celal had cleared a space and set a small bowl on a cloth embroidered with tiny tulips. The bowl was copper, dark with age and polished in the way that says this thing has been loved with the hands and not a chemical.\n\n\u201cIn the old days,\u201d he said, and she prepared to let her mind drift because in his mouth the old days came as the water of the fountain: cool, layered, and slower than a hurry, \u201cthere were women who lived alone on the hills. Not because they were banished, not because they were broken. Because they listened for the spun sugar in the air. They took the sugar and made spells that tasted like truth. People went to them with blank paper. The women wrote the letters that had not yet learned how to be spoken. They called them yaz\u0131c\u0131.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this story,\u201d she said, gently. \u201cMy mother told me to be careful with story-men.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother is impeccable,\u201d he said, and bowed like a man who in his secret life loved theater. \u201cBut she tells it slant, so you herself will do the rest.\u201d\n\nHe poured water into the copper bowl. The surface settled. He tilted the bowl so the light from the small high window spilled onto the water and came to rest like a hand. Then he took a pinch of ash from a jar and let it fall. The ash did not diffuse so much as arrange itself, and Leyla could not say where the arrangement, which was not arbitrary and was also not a picture, placed itself inside her. The pattern had the rightness of pottery. It had the violence of a lightning strike you watch from the safety of a stone house and yet you feel in your teeth.\n\n\u201cYou have been walking mornings again,\u201d he said, voice casual. \u201cThe kapadokya stone takes the echo of your steps and the old ones listen. It is polite, of course, for them to respond.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask,\u201d she said. The defensiveness surprised her; she tasted iron again and thought absurdly of her mother\u2019s nail on a lemon.\n\n\u201cYou were born asking.\u201d He brushed his finger along the rim of the bowl. The water hummed so soft it may have been her own heart singing back to drink itself. \u201cThere is a woman knitting something in the shade. She thinks she is making a shawl but it is a fishing net. Each loop says a name.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose names?\u201d\n\n\u201cYours. Mine. Hasan\u2019s. The ones who make bread, the ones who make buses run, the ones who will say \u2018this is the story of the time the sky fell into the pockets of our coats\u2019 and then forget it while their goats give birth and their children learn to count.\u201d He looked at her as if through her. \u201cShe is not making a shawl. She is making a sieve. She will sift the world and keep the fines and toss the rest.\u201d\n\nLeyla felt a simple anger that embarrassed her. \u201cWhat do you want me to do, hoca? Go to the hills and unknit the woman?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to begin.\u201d He pushed the bowl toward her. \u201cBreathe.\u201d\n\nShe breathed. The copper pushed her lungs open. The water remembered the salt flats and told her its truth: such as it had. She felt the tug of the dream house and saw, now, the woman\u2019s hand on a casement carved with leaves. The leaves were vines, the vines were mouths, the mouths whispered names the way thirsty people whisper water: with need and in prayer. The woman\u2019s face shifted. No, it was never stable, it was a cloud over a mountain and the mountain was the past and her past had many names. One stuck. Esmeray. Dark moon. The shape of her mouth was almost kind\u2014but empty in the corners, like a cup that had been poured out so often it forgot when it was full.\n\n\u201cLeyla,\u201d the dream said, and the library sank. The bowl in her hands went cold like a coin. \u201cLeyla, come. I have been making a place for you. It has a bed that remembers your bones and a garden where the roses tell me who I am. Come, and I will show you fountains. I will show you how to stop wanting. You will not want to breathe again. No one will. The hush is very good.\u201d\n\nShe pulled away as if from a cliff. The bowl slopped water onto the tulips, and Hoca Celal\u2019s hand was under the edge before it could slide. He did not look at her like she had failed. He looked at her like he was learning a map of the inside of a storm.\n\n\u201cYou see?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI see a woman who wants to stop the world.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cShe wants to stop it at full bloom. She cannot handle bruises.\u201d\n\nEsmeray. The name perched on her tongue like a leaf bird. If she said it out loud, would it start to tear at the corners?\n\n\u201cI am supposed to\u2026 what? Keep the world bruising?\u201d She laughed, and the laugh was three notes too sharp. \u201cIs that what saving looks like?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat saving looks like,\u201d he said, \u201cchanges depending on who is doing the looking. There are orders in Konya and in Istanbul and in places where the map reflects only sky. They will want your name. They will want to put it on a chain. Some of them will pray to you. Others will ask you to pray to them. I want you to keep your own name. That is all I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already have too many names,\u201d she said. \u201cK\u0131z, cad\u0131, o\u011flum\u2019s shadow, stubborn donkey who won\u2019t marry. And now this. Destiny is overrated.\u201d\n\n\u201cDestiny is a wind.\u201d He smiled like a man who had lost his teeth to laughter and had gotten them back by faith. \u201cYou can set your sail. You can drop anchor. You can dance on deck and spill tea and curse, but the wind is there.\u201d\n\nOn the way home, the sky had the thick look it wore before dust storms. She watched men secure tarps, women gather carpets in from the line, a child stand in the street and raise her arms, certain she could catch what ran between houses if she made her body into a net of joy.\n\nShe went to the well with a jug. The women there had their skirts tucked up into their waistbands, their sandals almost soaked in the breath of the old stone. \u201cIt smells wrong,\u201d one said. \u201cLike a burned pot.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything smells wrong in summer,\u201d another replied. \u201cEven husbands.\u201d\n\nThere was a tone to their jokes they wore only when the cold fear sat in their shoes. Leyla leaned over the circle and the well\u2019s face stared back at her, wet and hot at once. The rainbow was gone. The water was black the way a crow is black when it isn\u2019t pretending to be blue. A shape moved under the surface. That shouldn\u2019t be. The well did not have fish, had not in anyone\u2019s memory.\n\nShe almost turned because she did not want to be the kind of person who puts a hand in where she cannot see the bottom. But it asked. The bowl in the library had hummed; the well growled. She set the jug down and nodded to the woman who had married too young and was already carrying a second child in a belly hard as certainty.\n\n\u201cBana bir bez getir,\u201d Leyla said softly. The woman handed her a square of cloth, clean, with the printed blue flowers worn almost to ghost.\n\nLeyla tied the cloth around her wrist. A habit: not magic itself, but the shape of care she drew around it. She took a breath and reached, fingertips cutting the heat like knives into soft cake. The water resisted first and then took her like a mother who thinks you are leaving before the tea is finished. Something slick brushed her finger. She did not snatch back. It brushed again and slid under her palm. A fish. A fish in a closed well, strong, the length from her wrist to her elbow. She closed her hand and felt the tail slap twice, life, life, life, and then something else light and hard caught against her thumb.\n\nWhen she pulled her arm up, the water clung in strings. In her hand the fish shivered and then with a tiny snap broke into scales that were not scales but leaves, thin and almost translucent, like the first pages of a holy book. They fell and stuck to the stone. The thing she had caught with her thumb refused to sit anywhere properly until she willed it to. It was a ring. Copper, wide, with a slice of carnelian that had a crack in it like a lightning fork. It had the weight of a name.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother,\u201d the young mother said, \u201chad a ring like that. My uncle stole it to buy cigarettes.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything stolen returns eventually,\u201d an old woman said, and spat for luck. \u201cOr it makes babies elsewhere.\u201d\n\nLeyla dried her arm, heart stuttering like a bird. She slipped the ring into her pocket because when you have just stolen something from the dark you do not let the sun see you pass it hand to hand like gossip. Later. Later she would look.\n\nThat night, the dream did not wait for sleep. It climbed into the room by the window, silent, agile as a cat. The walls took on that green that is not color but intention; the bed under her held her as if deciding whether to keep her or to fold and pack her in a trunk for winter. A small nudge, and she was in the garden.\n\nShe had never seen such a garden. It was governed. The cypresses were too tall for their roots and bored of heaven. Roses wove themselves into tapestries of red so thick you could sew a boat from them and the boat would sail only in one direction: toward one name constantly spoken. There was a path. Paths everywhere, looping and lassoing and then leading to a wide flight of stairs that went up to a house made of leaves lacquered with light. A lush castle. Not a fortress of stone and dangerous angles, but something that grew and let you forget that you were walking into a mouth.\n\nEsmeray was on the stairs. She had a dress that shifted like shadow when light thinks too hard about its purpose. Her hair was gathered in a low knot that you could undo with one tug, and she wanted you to think about the tug, to feel it tick in your fingers, to make the wanting into duty. Her eyes were deliberate. Her smile was practice.\n\n\u201cLeyla.\u201d She said it with the dryness of a woman trying to hide thirst. \u201cCome. You are late. We have built fountains. The world cries too much. Let us stop the leaking. Let us stop the wind. It rattles the windows. Your people say it sours the milk. Let us close the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop?\u201d Leyla looked at the roses. They were perfect from far and plastic from nearer and she understood then that their perfection came from forgetting how to bruise. They had no smell. They had been coaxed into a silence that looked exactly like obedience. \u201cThe world spills for a reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it is clumsy. Because it is young. Because it has not learned yet what a sharp woman can do.\u201d Esmeray waved her hand and a fountain rose. It was clear, not wine now but crystal. Then it paused, froze mid-fall. The drops hung like beads on a string. In the pause there was a relief that ached. She was not wrong: the relief was a narcotic. Not wanting to want again felt like a way to save yourself from the sorrow of the second mouthful.\n\n\u201cYou want to kill breath,\u201d Leyla said, and heard how dramatic she sounded. But truth has a costume and sometimes you have to wear the whole thing even in daylight.\n\n\u201cI want to hold it between finger and thumb and count,\u201d Esmeray said. \u201cI want to keep from the mouths that bite and do not think. I want to save you from spilling down the steps of this garden with your stupid jug. I want to sit here and hear the many names said in the order I choose. I want to stop the scamper of time. It runs, it runs, it\u2019s exhausting. Aren\u2019t you tired, Leyla?\u201d\n\nLeyla was, in fact, tired. It was not smart to say so. \u201cI dream of you and I wake thirsty.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrink.\u201d Esmeray lifted her hand. The drops that had hung in the air arranged themselves into a string of pearls and then into a goblet and then the goblet was in Leyla\u2019s hand, heavy and cold with an edge that said this object could cut you or be used to club. \u201cDrink and stop. You owe your people breathlessness. They furnace themselves to feed days that do not thank them. Give them a rest.\u201d\n\nA woman at the edge of the path bent low and picked a rose with two fingertips as if pinching a nerve. She looked up at Leyla. Her face was the face of the bread-seller, then the face of the woman at the well, then Yasemin\u2019s face, then a face she had not met yet, then her own face at nineteen and the day her period did not come, then her face at eleven watching the goats while the sky blotted itself out because the women had said there was a dragon. The woman smiled with all of those faces and blew a kiss and turned to thorn.\n\nLeyla set the goblet down on the step. The drops did not spill. They did not resume. The goblet kept the shape of the held breath even after she let go.\n\n\u201cI like bruises,\u201d she said, because sometimes you have to say something dumb to see if it gets you kicked out. \u201cI like how they fade and tell a story in yellow and then green. I like that story.\u201d\n\nEsmeray\u2019s eyes went flat for a second. Then she gravely nodded. \u201cThen go and acquire as many bruises as you need, little mirror. Bring them back to me. I will teach you to keep them alive forever.\u201d Her kindness froze. \u201cNot yet. But you will come back.\u201d\n\nLeyla woke with her mouth dry as a ceramic bowl. She swung her legs out of bed and put her feet on the cold floor to remind her skin whose it was. The ring slid against her thigh from where she had tucked it into the seam of her pajama pants like a stupid child hiding candy. She pulled it out and turned it once in the half-light.\n\nThe crack in the carnelian was not simply crack. It had been etched, faintly, with letters that did not stay still. She set it on the table and the letters did not want to be looked at, and then they did, as if irritated that a human would presume to try to read them without paying. She tilted her head. The script ranged over Arabic calligraphy this way and Hittite cuneiform that way and then, for an instant, something like the loops her grandmother made in her embroidery when she wanted to hide a prayer in the border of a pillowcase.\n\n\u201cEs- me- ray.\u201d The letters smiled at her when she dared say it. Her tongue betrayed her and gave the syllables sweetness. \u201cG\u00fclce. Dark moon.\u201d The ring was both a gift and a theft; it had stolen itself from the well so she could have it. A stupid thing, an arrogant thing. A thread.\n\nShe went to the kitchen because the muscles of morning made coffeepots lift themselves and hands find olives. Zeynep was already there. Of course she was. The lemon half rested on the cutting board like it had just told a joke that no one had gotten yet.\n\n\u201cB\u00f6yle, k\u0131z\u0131m,\u201d her mother said without greeting her, and pinched a paper-thin line of salt into the pan where eggs slid toward their appointed place. \u201cToday you go to Konya. Visit your aunt. She needs help with the carpet order. The bus leaves at nine.\u201d\n\nLeyla looked at her with the slow respect of a woman who knows her mother\u2019s veils and how they sometimes shift to reveal other women underneath. \u201cWhich aunt?\u201d\n\n\u201cEmine. The thick one.\u201d Zeynep flicked her eye toward the ring before she could stop herself. \u201cShe is the sort of woman who does not lose rings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are sending me away?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sending you where you can be found by those who are looking responsibly.\u201d She wiped her hands and pulled a card from her apron pocket like a magician who uses only domestic objects. The card was yellowed, stamped with a seal she did not read. An address. \u201cYou will go to this place. There is a man who is a woman who is a man who is neither. They will tell you what their name ought to be today. They will tell you about the ring. You will not show your throat to anyone who calls you princess.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a princess.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy head knows it. Your feet know it. But your heart forgets. It is too easy to want someone to close the door and stop the wind that annoys you while you cook.\u201d Zeynep put her hand to her daughter\u2019s cheek. The thumb made tiny circles as if smoothing worry into ghee. \u201cI lost your father to a story. I will not lose you because you are writing the new one and forgot to hold the pen. Take Yasemin or do not. She will be offended if you ask; offended if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask,\u201d Leyla said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll let it be her fault.\u201d\n\nLater, at the bus stop, Yasemin was already there with a bag so small it made a mockery of travel. She wore an expression that said, I\u2019m angry you made me come and I wouldn\u2019t have forgiven you if you hadn\u2019t. Hasan had stuffed a paper bag into her hands, apricots and a small roll of lokum dusted like an old wedding.\n\n\u201cI told him we\u2019ll bring him back a wife,\u201d Yasemin said, almost cheerfully. \u201cMade of eggshell and garlic, with hands like a sharp pillow.\u201d\n\nThe bus ground in on a cloud of diesel and a smell of old upholstery. A woman three seats back had a baby wrapped onto her spine like a turtle\u2019s house. A man with cheap sunglasses had a suit jacket slung over his shoulder and a municipal swagger. Leyla took the window because she had always preferred to sit with the world and let faces slip past like fish, each flashing a piece of the sun and taking it away again.\n\nWhen the road curved and the fairy chimneys were gone, the flat opened and the sky let its own weight be seen at the edges. Leyla touched the ring in her pocket and the bus muttered and coughed. She felt a tug ahead, like the road was a ribbon and someone was winding it around their wrist, pulling.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re quiet.\u201d Yasemin had her head turned so the gold hoop in her ear could be admired by passing oversight committees if they looked in through the bus\u2019s greasy glass. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to dive in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might be.\u201d She glanced at her friend. \u201cYou can get off at the petrol station and go back. I won\u2019t be angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t have the chance.\u201d Yasemin\u2019s mouth bent. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop the wind if not you? You were born with your hair stuck to your lip from the breeze, my mother says. Don\u2019t come back with some city boy who drinks imported water and tells us we\u2019ve been sitting wrong our whole lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo boys,\u201d Leyla said with a sigh that didn\u2019t know what it meant. \u201cJust gardens. And a woman with a castle made of green. She wants to stop us.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants to stop herself,\u201d Yasemin said unexpectedly, and then folded into sleep like laundry arranged well.\n\nThey rolled. Village to village. Mosques with new paint and minarets that had tried to grow taller overnight and failed. Tea gardens with empty plastic chairs waiting in squares where men would sit and watch flocks of nothing pass. At the edge of everything, always, dust, lifting in little warnings. Konya rose from the plain, square and sensible and old, with Mevlana\u2019s green dome throwing itself up like the first line of a poem that refuses to make sense until the end. The bus slowed. The city did not notice them enter. It had bigger work.\n\nAt the stop, a man with a suitcase larger than his grievances tripped and apologized to the air. Leyla and Yasemin stepped into heat that scolded and immediately forgave. The address was a few streets away, tucked in a lane where all the doors were taller than expected and each had a knocker divided into two rings: one for men, one for women, so you knew how to answer.\n\nThey found the door with the seal from Zeynep\u2019s card carved over it. Leyla lifted the smaller knocker. The ring was heavy and the sound it made was not a knock. It was the sound of a book closing.\n\nThe person who opened the door was old the way the moon is: with a youth that repeats itself. Their eyes made a ladder. They smiled in the corner with one side of their mouth and frowned with the other as if to remind the world to expand and shrink at once. Their hair was covered and uncovered: a scarf looped but not tied. They wore a ring of their own, black stone and silver.\n\n\u201cYou are late and you are early,\u201d they said, and their voice had the geography of throat-singers and lullabies both. \u201cCome in. Put your name in a bowl and see which letters float.\u201d Their gaze took Leyla in with the gentlest greed. \u201cYou brought a ring but left your good luck at home. Good. Luck hides you from the world\u2019s true edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cZeynep sent me,\u201d Leyla said, cautious with the way words liked to jump out of their skins here. \u201cShe said you would tell me what to do. She said you are a man who is a woman who is neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am R\u0131za.\u201d They bowed with an angle that felt like a short prayer. \u201cIt is enough for today. Tomorrow I will be a complaint. The day after, a celebration. Sit. Everyone who matters sits before they stand.\u201d\n\nYasemin hovered, then realized the hovering was the exact opposite of what the room wanted, and she let gravity have her knees with a soft oof. The room was lined in carpets that had held ankles through disputes about God. Books leaned against each other like cousins. The ceiling was low enough that you had to nod to your own thoughts.\n\nR\u0131za set a simple ceramic bowl on the rug between them. They poured water. No copper, this time. Earth. When they set the ring down at the bottom of the bowl, the carnelian throbbed once and then fell quiet. R\u0131za looked at it without greed. (It was important: the way the looking landed.) They blew across the surface. The water shivered, and the letters that had refused to sit earlier now rose like fish eager for hands.\n\n\u201cEsmeray,\u201d R\u0131za said without surprise. \u201cOld friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know her?\u201d Yasemin\u2019s voice broke with the child in it and tried to force itself back together. \u201cWhere is her house? We will burn it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps later.\u201d R\u0131za\u2019s eyes creased. \u201cIf we burn it now, we burn Leyla with it. There is a thread already. The woman throws them out like fishermen and waits for the sea to remember who made it. She is patient.\u201d\n\nThe room shifted. No, it was the day: the day cast a new light and the small motes of everything, dust and tiny mistakes and glances, became visible. R\u0131za dipped their finger into the bowl, then lifted the finger to their mouth and tasted the truth.\n\n\u201cYou are not the first they called,\u201d they said. \u201cBut you are the one this time. The old song has its lines and then a line that wanders. You are the wandering line. It will make the song better. Or it will make everything break. \u015eans.\u201d\n\n\u201cLuck.\u201d Yasemin locked her fingers and unlocked them. \u201cYou said she left her luck at home. On purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe brought me instead,\u201d Leyla said softly, and both her friends glanced sideways at her and accidentally smiled because the truth sometimes has good manners.\n\n\u201cYou think too small.\u201d R\u0131za flicked water at her, blessing or sarcasm or both. \u201cYou will think big later. You will hate it. For now: you begin. There is an Order here, yes. There is an echo in Istanbul where men who cannot be quiet wrap insults in their faith and call it fasting. There are women who spin in rooms without witnesses and call what they feel by the names of their grandmothers so they can keep it. All of them want to move and to stop. Esmeray offers stopping. You will offer moving. That is the fight.\u201d\n\nThey looked at the ring again, and the ring lay in the water like a sleeping animal who dreams of running. The crack caught the light and threw it somewhere only Leyla\u2019s cheek felt. \u201cYou will go to Istanbul,\u201d R\u0131za said. \u201cYou will meet Esmeray halfway. You will not go alone. You will carry names like food. When someone tries to call you something that sours your teeth, spit it out. All right?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Leyla said, and felt the yes unscroll down her bones. \u201cI am not a princess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d R\u0131za\u2019s mouth was kind now, and tired. \u201cYou are a witch. There are no tiaras, only bruises. Gather them. Give them to me later. I will write them into our carpet and we will walk on forgetting and remember anyway.\u201d\n\nOutside, the sky rummaged in itself and found thunder. The first drops of a large rain slapped the stone like a grandmother\u2019s palm on a child\u2019s back: stern, loving, unavoidable. The wind ran around the corner and through the door and lifted the thin hair on Leyla\u2019s arm like a curtain opened two minutes too early.\n\n\u201cHaydi,\u201d R\u0131za said, and the word tilted the world. \u201cBegin.\u201d",

                              "content": "The rain went at the courtyard like a drummer who had waited too long to play and now forgot what quiet tasted like. It beat the stone dark and tamed the dust into fragrant mud, lifted the iron smell of the earth so it could bless and scold in the same breath. Inside, R\u0131za\u2019s house gathered the weather and turned it into story. The carpets held the sound like a palm. The kettle took the hint and began to hum.\n\n\u201cTonight you sleep here,\u201d R\u0131za said, already lining a low bed with sheets that had the crisp feel of something folded perfectly and put away against the day when it would be necessary to prove that care had not gone out of fashion. \u201cIn the morning, you go. If you go while the rain is still honest, the road will admit you. If you wait until the clouds are only gossip, the road will play tricks.\u201d\n\nYasemin stood by the window and tried to count raindrops as if it were a way to keep from counting worries. \u201cYour house smells like somun bread when it comes out of the oven and everyone lies and says they\u2019re not hungry, just to be polite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the old flour,\u201d R\u0131za said, and winked toward a ceramic jar in the corner. \u201cWhen we forget to feed the starter, the house reminds us. Sit. We work with names and dough.\u201d\n\nThey brought out a wooden board with grooves so fine the eye lost count, and set it across their knees. The bowl that would have held dough, tonight held paper\u2014thin leaves of lokma recipe pages, old envelopes, thin blue aerograms that had failed to arrive anywhere. R\u0131za poured a little of the rain into the empty copper bowl not to use it, but to let the sound of the rain coming home live on the table with them. Then they drew out a bundle wrapped in cloth and untied it as if unwrapping a child\u2019s first shoes. Inside, there were stones. Not gems, or not only gems; river stones with names carved under the polish of hands. Each one fit its place in the palm like it had been waiting for this seller. Each bore a word. Some in scratchy Ottoman that made Yasemin\u2019s lip curl; some neat in Latin letters; one in Greek; one in a script that watched them watching it and refused to declare its allegiance.\n\n\u201cThese are not charms,\u201d R\u0131za said quietly. \u201cThey are weights. Names are heavier when they have lived. You asked how to carry names like food. You cannot carry soup in your pockets. You must bake it. You will do that in Istanbul.\u201d\n\nLeyla handled the stones and felt the way they pulled. Kad\u0131n. R\u00fczgar. Su. Ana. Heves. Sab\u0131r. Some were slippery because they wanted to be alive without being useful. Some were rough because they knew they had been used too often and resented it. She closed her fingers around one that was not the prettiest and felt it drop her hand toward her lap with its simple gravity. \u015eifa. The old word for a cure that was more temper than medicine. This one smelled of mint tea and wet wool. She kept it.\n\n\u201cPut three in your bag,\u201d R\u0131za said. \u201cOne for each of you, and one to give away in a moment you will recognize at once and then not forgive yourself for if you do not take it. Do not confuse recognizing with liking. That mistake has made and unmade empires.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take \u2018patience\u2019,\u201d Yasemin said, plucking Sab\u0131r with a decisive movement that already made the word look different. \u201cSo at least I can say I tried.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me the one that thinks it is stronger than it needs to be,\u201d Leyla murmured, and her fingers found R\u00fczgar by instinct as if the stone had shrunk itself to fit the place between her thumb and forefinger where wind always lived. She liked that the letter z in the middle was a hinge.\n\n\u201cFor me,\u201d R\u0131za said, and their hands, older than anyone\u2019s guess, chose Su with tenderness. \u201cI am too clever with air. Water makes me honest.\u201d They let the one called Ana slide back into the bowl because there are words you cannot pick for yourself unless you are a fool or a prophet. Then they took a different cloth and unfurled it to reveal a comb.\n\nThe comb was not for hair. Its teeth were long and thin and made of olive wood, stained in color at the tips: pine green, saffron, the blue of prayer rugs, pomegranate. It looked like a tool for grooming a map. When R\u0131za ran their thumb along the spine, the rain seemed to remember a rhythm it had learned in a tin basin years ago when a woman with sore wrists did laundry and sang.\n\n\u201cIn Istanbul you will visit my friend,\u201d they said. \u201cHer name is Feride. She lives in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar by the sea that thinks it is a river and pays rent to no one. She has a tray where she lays down water and thickens it until it learns to listen. She paints on it and lifts the paintings off. Marbling, the polite call it. Ebru, those who understand. The water is the page and the page is the witness. Esmeray loves Feride\u2019s work because it is water trained to hold a shape. Do you see why this is dangerous?\u201d\n\nLeyla saw immediately and wished she did not because seeing sometimes creates life. Ink laid on water that holds. Patterns coaxed smooth and fixed. Beauty that refuses to blur. She felt the pressure behind her eyes that meant tears were waiting with their shoes on, pretending patience. \u201cYou want me to go make a mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to go learn how to let the water keep a secret,\u201d R\u0131za said. \u201cA paper that knows how to forget can be a door. A paper that refuses to forget is a wall. There are enough walls. We need doors.\u201d\n\nYasemin\u2019s laugh bounced and then softened. \u201cYou are going to make me fall in love with a piece of paper and then tear it in half.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be brave enough to do it,\u201d R\u0131za said, and set their palm on her head briefly, a gesture so old it came through the door with its shoes off.\n\nThey ate the omelet that would not be improved by any more care, and Turkish coffee that settled into their mouths like a prediction that refused to be pinned. The rain declared itself done and went to find mischief elsewhere. Night came early because the clouds had forgotten to leave anything behind for the moon to dress herself with.\n\nSleep in a house that agreed with you was a thing to write a letter about, if one still wrote letters. The low murmur of traffic, the wheeze of a neighbor\u2019s faulty boiler, the mutter of the old cat in the yard telling the younger cats that no one had ever suffered like him\u2014these sounds made a quilt. Under it, Leyla drifted. She did not mean to dream, but dreams are a village and the edges are soft. She found herself under trees too straight and shining, with a leaf pinned to her breast as a badge. When she tried to blow on it to see if it was real, it did not stir. A child made of vines watched her with a boredom that felt like punishment. A fountain whispered. The drops suspended in air quivered like fish that cannot decide whether life will be warmer or colder if they jump.\n\nShe woke and wanted salt. She licked her wrist. There it was. For a foolish minute she laughed into the bedding until she had to bite the knuckle of her index finger to stop. Then she slipped the ring onto her thumb and let the carnelian sit there like a guest who might soon tell a story and might just demand more tea.\n\nDawn in Konya is a sensible thing. It does not throw itself at you. Men wiped their shopfront glass with newspapers so old the headlines had become spells. Women bundled toddlers and bags. R\u0131za had already packed what needed to be packed: the comb wrapped and slipped into a pocket that would not tell on it; the stones rattling against each other like cousins forced to share the back seat; a tiny jar with a pinch of gum tragacanth that smelled faintly of bitter roots and coming discipline. They gave Leyla a small notebook bound in soft brown leather and did not pretend it was magic.\n\n\u201cYou will write,\u201d they said. \u201cNot to become a yaz\u0131c\u0131. Not to make books. To keep your own name from wandering. People who do not write their names somewhere lose them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill it matter if I write gri for grey or boz?\u201d Leyla asked, tracing the spine. \u201cMy grandmother thinks one is for rain and one for wool and if you say the wrong one when you are talking about a pigeon, you will never be able to find your way home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will matter in your mouth,\u201d R\u0131za said, and kissed her forehead, then did the same to Yasemin, whose eyes betrayed her.\n\nThe bus to the city smelled as always of ambition and mopped floors. Yasemin bargained the fare with a driver who scolded and then winked and took their coins like a king who has decided he can afford to be merciful today. They found seats together and clamped their bags on their laps because they were not fools. Fields slid by, a green that could not be bothered to convince anyone that it was lush. The road unrolled its ribbon of tired endurance. Leyla watched the way puddles spoke back to the sky, then let her eyes close and feel the weight of the notebook in the top flap of her bag, the stones proving their weight against her thighs, the ring\u2019s lazy pulse.\n\nOn the outskirts, the bus collected more men than it wanted. A boy with battered sneakers got on, his hair shaved in a way that insisted it had been his idea. He stood by the door and balanced as if born to it. The ring on Leyla\u2019s thumb warmed when he grabbed the rail and spoke his mother\u2019s name to the driver with both sass and sorrow in it. Names know when they are said with love. She wondered which of her own names, if spoken aloud here, would make the ring heat or cool, and then decided not to play that game because there is a time and place for self-indulgence and it is never a moving bus.\n\nBy the time they crossed into the city\u2019s myth, the bus had already acclimated to the idea of traffic like a camel to a new ridge of sand. Billboards made polite lies and outrageous invitations in equal measure. Apartment blocks smirked down at older houses that had no interest in smirking back because they had survived men with guns and men with plans and both were only men. The air thickened with exhaust and a salt shrug that said, the sea is not far. Leyla would have known it with her eyes closed. The wind here had an accent. Poyraz, sharp from the north, had a bite even in warm months; lodos came fat and slow and put his hands everywhere.\n\nThey came in by Harem, the bus station that believed in perpetual arrival. Between horns and voices and the extraordinary drama of a man waving his hands at a woman who adjusted her scarf with an expression that said she would later tell this story differently, the sea flashed. It was a slick of pewter under the grey lid of the day. Ferries called, a blunt, longing sound.\n\n\u201c\u00dcsk\u00fcdar,\u201d Yasemin said, not because she didn\u2019t know where they were but because saying the name made a promise to her feet. \u201cThe woman with water.\u201d\n\nThey pushed through a crowd that did not need them and so did not dislike them. The square was wet with the morning\u2019s last mutterings of rain. Pigeons hopped, purposeful as bureaucrats. Men in vests shouted about fish and tickets, their voices sawing the air into usable pieces. The mosque stood with impeccable posture, green the way certain metals are patient. The tower of the Maiden watched from her island outpost like a woman who knows how to hold her own sad story without letting it swallow her.\n\nFeride lived in a building that had survived by convincingly pretending to be ordinary. A wedge of it took the corner. The stairs were the narrow kind that instruct you to place your feet one after the other as if you must be careful not to break the city. On the second floor, the door was open the way a language invites you in with a word that can mean both \u201chello\u201d and \u201cbe my guest or be my burden, we shall see.\u201d The smell met them first. It was river and glue and something sweet. Inside, the room along the long wall was window, all light that had made its mind up and then changed it because the sea does that to light. Tables. Trays. Brushes with horsehair bristles. The long combs like spines of small saints.\n\n\u201cHo\u015f geldiniz,\u201d said a woman whose face would have been severe if her hands had not immediately betrayed her into fussing with a stray thread on the edge of a paper that had already dried into certainty. She wore a smock already stained with blue that remembered the inside of the eye and a red that had refused to be quiet. Her hair was pinned up with a violence that suggested an argument with the day. \u201cWhich of you is the one who refuses to harden?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Leyla,\u201d she offered, and waited for the words to settle on the floor between them like dropped coins. \u201cR\u0131za sent us.\u201d\n\nThe woman smiled, not out of politeness; out of recognition of a name that had taught her something difficult and then fed her good soup. \u201cFeride,\u201d she said, and the name fit her. \u201cCome and be clumsy. You have one hour to misbehave with water before it decides it has had enough of us for today.\u201d\n\nThey washed their hands. It felt ceremonial because their hands remembered the well and two lifetimes of kitchens. Feride kept speaking while she set the tray, as if the room understood her as well as her students did. \u201cWe thicken the water with tragacanth from the mountain,\u201d she said. \u201cWe make the water into a listener. Then we lay color\u2014pigments ground to a paste with patience and something with a tongue in it, I refuse to tell you more until you have earned it. The horsehair brush speaks. The paint spreads. The comb teaches it to like order. Then I betray the comb. Because pattern is a way to lie.\u201d\n\nYasemin, who had been skeptical in the way of someone whose hands prefer plucking grapes to this kind of reverent labor, found her skepticism embarrassed by delight. The color when it met the surface spread in circles that felt like conversations overheard through a wall you had not believed was so thin. A drop of tulip-red teased the blue and then both agreed to be something else the way married people sometimes conspire against their own vows. The comb\u2019s teeth combed, and the water learned to accept lines. Feride made an easy peacock of it and then destroyed the peacock with one gentle pass of a stylus so that it folded back into a field of something like breath.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d she told them, and turned the tray. \u201cYou will never be sure a second time. Good. Certainty is a kind of mold.\u201d\n\nWhen she let Leyla touch the brush, the ring hummed. The water in the tray did not swallow the paint. It took it at the edge, then stopped, as if it had arms and had crossed them. Feride, who had not been watching, turned very slowly. She did not widen her eyes. \u201cAh,\u201d she said, in a way that means both greeting and curse. \u201cThis one already knows a way to be stubborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t me,\u201d Leyla said, and felt foolish because who else could it be besides her and the water and the good paint that had done nothing to deserve this attitude.\n\n\u201cIt never is,\u201d Feride replied. \u201cBreathe.\u201d\n\nShe breathed. The ring on her thumb warmed a degree. The paint hesitated, then flowed. She laid down another color. The circles that in Feride\u2019s hand had looked like deciding which cousin\u2019s wedding to skip, in hers looked like breath trying to find a place to live. She dragged the comb through. She was not delicate enough. A line snagged. A hesitation caught and held. On the second pull, she felt the drag become a voice that asked for a pause she could not afford to give.\n\nThe room shifted along its hinge. Outside, the ferry\u2019s horn came at the wrong time. No, the ferry was punctual, and the world had stepped a half beat off the measure. The hair on Leyla\u2019s forearms rose in a neat chorus. Feride\u2019s smile did not move but her body anchored itself without changing its stance; someone who has worked around small catastrophes knows how to hold a tray so it does not tell on you. Yasemin sucked a peppermint into the pocket under her tongue as if sugar could keep the air friendly.\n\n\u201cI felt you in Konya,\u201d said a voice that did not belong to a woman standing at any door and yet already had laid its elbows on the table. It was not in the room and it absolutely was. The comb in Leyla\u2019s hand trembled. \u201cI felt you at the well. I left you a fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou left me a ring,\u201d Leyla said, because arguments sometimes have to be opened with petty corrections. \u201cYou stole the fish as soon as it remembered it had been a page.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not steal it, I asked it to grow where it was placed.\u201d Esmeray\u2019s patience came like syrup, sweet and suffocating. \u201cYour mother was the one who taught you we do what we can for beauty. Look.\u201d The paint in the tray had frozen. They could move; the paint could not. The circles hung perfect. The comb\u2019s last path sat there like a thought that refused to be doubted. If Leyla leaned down, she could see her face reflected in the green center of one circle, and her face looked suddenly like someone else\u2019s\u2014the woman at the well, the girl on the bus, the infant with her mouth open in the catlike expectant posture of the newly arrived. The urge to leave her finger in until it was held was a pulse. The relief promised was indecent.\n\nFeride did not break any glass. She did not shout or make that frantic hand flutter that says, now we have a problem. She picked up the smallest of her instruments, a needle so old it had lost its right to shine, and touched the locked surface with the gentleness of a midwife on a baby\u2019s soft mouth. The skin of the water shivered. It wanted to refuse. It decided to accept.\n\n\u201cI work with what wants to keep secrets,\u201d Feride said into the air as if a child needed to be told to stop teasing the cat. \u201cI taught my tray to create a door. You can come whisper, Esmeray. But if you touch my comb, I will put vinegar in your fountain and make your roses weep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are rude,\u201d said the voice with interest rather than anger. \u201cI like rude women until they become inconvenient. And they always do.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of my workshop,\u201d Feride said, and then smiled because humor is a knife that cannot be confiscated at the door. \u201cUnless you have money.\u201d She lifted the paper in one seamless pull that made the image lay down its flag and agree to be carried. The pattern came up: circles layered like breath in a meditative chest, lines perfect on the left and messy on the right and beautiful in the way that made a person stop and want to put their lips to the page. \u201cPretty,\u201d she said, and then ruined it with a flick of her wrist that dragged a finger of brown through the red\u2019s self-satisfaction. \u201cNow it will not trap a child. Hang it.\u201d\n\nYasemin swallowed the peppermint. \u201cI had a headache and it left,\u201d she said, surprised. \u201cI was not telling you because I did not want to be the kind of woman who announces her pain like a weather forecast.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may announce anything you like in here,\u201d Feride said. \u201cTomorrow it will be gone and I will take credit. Again,\u201d she told Leyla. \u201cStop thinking of Esmeray like a queen. Treat her like the woman at the market who tries to sell you fat tomatoes in December. She is offering you an out-of-season sweetness that will fail you.\u201d\n\nThis time, when Leyla set the brush against the water, she thought of bruises. The purple at the edge of reminder. The way the yellow warms and then the green comes in sly. The way the skin tells the truth without asking you. She remembered the time she fell at ten and skinned both knees and the cement drank some of her and kept it. She remembered the day last winter when she slammed the gate in a hurry and pinched the crescent soft skin between thumb and finger, and it throbbed for a day; the ache had been her own metronome. The water gave up its stubbornness with less ceremony. She breathed. She dragged the comb, slower, an apology in her hand.\n\nThe ring on her thumb vibrated like a moth at a window. The crack in the carnelian threw a thin line of light onto the water\u2019s skin. The line moved, not quite obeying. Letters tried to form and failed because the medium refused to remember them; the tragedy made the page beautiful. A word in the old script that had refused to pick sides tried to rise and then sank as if someone who was not hungry pretended to be generous. Feride nodded once so small it might have been a twitch. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cNow ruin this one a little. Take it down from the wall where it would hang over someone\u2019s couch. Bring it into the kitchen.\u201d\n\nLeyla dipped the needle into the tray in a foolish little zigzag because mischief has to come from somewhere, and watched the perfectly rounded globes of red and blue accept their scars. The paper came up with a sound like a sigh through teeth. When she hung it, she did not think of buyers. She thought of the fountain in their village and the wrong rainbow and the way the fish had become leaves for a second and then nothing. She thought of planting and of the tobacco fields below the hill where the men had said there would be a factory one day if anyone could be bothered to organize. She thought of her mother\u2019s thumb on her cheek.\n\n\u201cYou came to me because someone told you to,\u201d Feride said when their hands had began to behave as if they had always worked like this. \u201cYou will leave because you want to. Before you go, you must write the names.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich names?\u201d Yasemin asked. \u201cWe have a handful already, and I am afraid of tripping over them and falling on my face in this city. People will laugh and steal my phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ones who will hold the door after you pass through,\u201d Feride said. She gestured to a low stool where a child had chalked tally marks as if trying to count all the ferry horns there had ever been. \u201cYou will need fishmongers, yes. And the woman who sells needlework and has always wanted to be a nurse. And the old man with the pigeon who still believes pigeons carry letters. And the girl who cleans the semahane after the tourists go and replaces the hidden water glasses with a patience that will save someone. And the one who sweeps the steps of the Galata tower every Friday and spits into the wind and gives thanks. And the young man who dances alone in his room to old Arabesk and thinks no one understands him. And the woman who thinks she hates the sea but cannot go a day without crossing on a ferry.\u201d She smiled at the way their faces had gone from worried to pleased to overwhelmed. \u201cYou will not meet all of them. You will meet the thread that ties them. If you touch that, it is enough. Now, go. Eat bread with fish. Stand on the bridge where men pretend they are the only ones who know how to wait. Take the ring near the current and see if it tells you whether the wind intends to be our friend today.\u201d\n\nThey left with paper that would warp if you looked at it wrong, and the comb wrapped and heavy now that it had been defied by a woman with a garden for a house. \u00dcsk\u00fcdar outside was its perpetual talking self, but the day had made a small adjustment to fit them. Leyla had the sense of stepping a half centimeter to the left of where she would have placed her foot an hour before. It was not unpleasant. It felt like saving your skirt from tea.\n\nBy the water, the men had their lines out. The gulls had an opinion about everything. A vendor pressed lemon into the cut of a fish with such tender violence that Leyla briefly wanted to marry him and then remembered she did not want marriage with anyone who thought their own sadness was the only interesting one in the room. They paid for two sandwiches and let the thin pickles try to convince the bread that life could be bright even after it touched frying oil.\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d Yasemin said through a mouth too full. \u201cYou look like a woman who will go faint because a poem decided to stand over her and hide the sun. Eat, or I will tell your mother you let yourself be stolen by ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdeas are broke,\u201d Leyla said, obediently taking a huge bite. \u201cThey cannot get the bus fare.\u201d And then the ring went cold as if remembering a winter in a city where pipes froze.\n\nThe wind shifted. A heaviness rolled in from the southwest. The men fishing looked up in the way of men who live by the timing of elements. A child began to cry not because anything had happened but because the body knows the weight of lodos before the mind remembers the word. People become loud under lodos. They become tender or ridiculous. Women sweep more angrily. Bread goes stale faster; people shout at the bread. Eyes sting. Headaches bloom. The old city feels it worst, like a convalescent when someone opens a window too soon. Lodos was the wind Esmeray would choose if she could pick only one, Leyla thought. It numbed the edge where desire and grief shake hands.\n\nThe Bosphorus was never still, not even when the world pretended. Its two currents argued over who was the elder sibling. At the railing, the ring tugged toward the center as if recognizing blood. Leyla leaned. The water below broke itself into small fists and smoothed out, broke and smoothed, a conversation that will go on long after any of them remembered to listen. She could feel the comb in her bag like a reminder. She could feel the papers under her arm like a promise she had not had the right to make.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Yasemin said suddenly, pointing across at the opposite bank where houses shouldered each other and trees did what they could with little earth. A yal\u0131, an old wooden house right at the waterline, let the ivy have its way with it. The leaves made a mask instead of a face. Windows peeked. A balcony sagged with the kind of elegance only an aged flirt carries. It had the look of a place that had listened to secrets about sultans and shoe salesmen and had no intention of telling. It was beautiful and annoying. It looked like a place where someone could decide never to open a door again and call it wisdom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s her house,\u201d Leyla said, and felt foolish because there were a thousand houses that wore leaves and not a one belonged to a woman with a garden for a castle, but the pull was not pretending. The ring cooled and heated like a breath held and let go. She could taste copper the way she did when the wind agreed to listen. Something under the quay creaked. A ferry groaned and accepted passengers like a man who knows he will be confessed to against his will.\n\n\u201cWe go,\u201d Yasemin said. \u201cWe give her back her ring and tell her to shut her eyes and count to a thousand and then to open them and repent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go.\u201d Leyla folded the papers as if folding a child\u2019s shirt and slipped them deeper into her bag. The ferry horn shuddered through her. She stepped on board before thinking about money, and a man with a stack of simit on his head laughed and stepped aside and was blessed despite himself for it. The boat pushed off. The city spread itself, each dome and high stone a boast and a prayer, each splash against the hull the telling of an old joke.\n\nFeride had said to write the names. If she were the kind of woman who attended to advice efficiently, she would have found the notebook and begun. Instead she put her palm on the painted rail and listened to the sea reading a list that had no alphabet. She said the names silently. Zeynep. Celal. Hasan. Sabiha. R\u0131za. Feride. Yasemin. She did not yet include Esmeray because a name on the tongue is a coin you spend. The wind bumped her shoulder like an uncle who always pretends his jokes are better than they are. The headland took them and returned them, the city a mouth that chewed and did not bite.\n\nOn the other side, the steps up from the ferry were too tall for good sense and everyone took them anyway. A boy with roses said \u201cAblam,\u201d in a tone that suggested he would change his own luck if someone would let him. A dog slept in the most inconvenient spot he could find and dreamed of whatever it is dogs in this city dream of\u2014shaved meat, garbage triumphs, women\u2019s hands. They followed the narrow street along the water. The yal\u0131 waited. Its leaves moved without breeze. The ring cooled.\n\n\u201cDo you think she will answer the door,\u201d Yasemin said, collecting her courage into one braid and then deciding she would be prettier with it loose. \u201cOr will the leaves put a palm on our foreheads and say we have fevers and must go home?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the leaves had hands, we could become scarves,\u201d Leyla said, and knocked the old brass knocker that surprised her by being warm like someone else had just touched it.\n\nThe door swung a finger\u2019s width wider, not on the principle of hospitality but the way a man opens his jacket to show that he is not carrying a weapon and then remembers he is in fact carrying six. The hall smelled of cold. The kind that burns. The kind that sits in old wood and loves its own company. Leyla had the impulse to set a pot of soup down in the entryway and leave without knocking again.\n\n\u201cIt is impolite to keep a lady waiting,\u201d said the voice from too many directions at once, and the leaves shivered inside their own sound. \u201cCome in, Leyla. Bring me the things you think you are carrying so cleverly. I will take them, and in return I will take away so much of your weight you will resent me for making you light.\u201d\n\nThey crossed the threshold, and the air changed temperature without changing moral. The hall grew long when they walked and shortened when they paused. Mirrors watched them without being honest about how reflective they were. The ring apologized now and then. The paper under Leyla\u2019s arm whispered like a flock. She had the dizzying sense that if she set it down she would hear it try to complain itself into not being art.\n\nAt the top of the stairs where a landing shifted its size the way a tongue shifts a lie, a woman sat with both elbows on the banister like a teenager in disguise as a queen. The shape of her face altered as the light moved. The corners of her mouth were still empty. Her dress today was the green of olive leaves before the dust, and it moved when she moved, and sometimes when she did not.\n\n\u201cYou invited me to your garden,\u201d Leyla said, because starting with the obvious is a way to keep the floor from giving way. \u201cYou offered me a rest. I am stubborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Esmeray said, and smiled in a way that suggested the world had misdiagnosed her for years. \u201cCome. Eat. Then we will decide what to kill and what to keep.\u201d She turned, and the house breathed in. It became a garden on an exhale. The roses made the shadow of a smell. The fountains began to pour and then paused, caught between impulses.\n\nYasemin touched Leyla\u2019s elbow once, a signal they had worked out when they were nine and had stolen painted eggs. The signal meant: I am here. Do not be brave alone. Leyla let the push move her. She set the comb down on the edge of a marble basin as if putting a book on a bedside table. She waited to see if the water would scream.\n\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d Esmeray said lazily, eyes on the carnelian. \u201cYou brought me a toy. Good. And my ring. You are tidy, after all. Return it to me and I will give you back your mornings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot give me back anything I did not give you,\u201d Leyla said, surprised at the tone in her own voice, which had discovered sarcasm and set it to simmer. \u201cI brought you a comb to make you itch. And the paper you cannot bear to be near because it does not tell you you are right.\u201d\n\nEsmeray did not flinch. She walked to the nearest fountain and put her hand into the falling water. It halted at her wrist. It made beads like a miscounted rosary. \u201cI am tired of this,\u201d she said simply. \u201cOf being open all the time, of my own moving. Men move and call it conquest; women move and call it restlessness and shame. I do not wish to be the sea anymore. I want to be the lake in a painting where the ducks never tire.\u201d She lifted her hand and the beads of water hung in the air like ornaments that might be smashable or edible depending on your hunger. \u201cDo not make me into a villain so you feel prouder of your breath.\u201d\n\nLeyla could have wept because underneath the manipulation there was something she recognized: the exhaustion of being porous. It had a weight. It had bruises of its own. Her heart being a fool, she almost reached out to touch that tiredness. Her mind, a more loyal friend than she had credited, put a hand on her wrist and said, wait.\n\n\u201cI will not undo you,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cYou are a woman, and I am not an axe. I will ask for doors. That is all. Windows. Holes. Places where the air will sneak in and make you curse me and then thank me in your sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not sleep,\u201d Esmeray said, and the way she said it was so human that even the mirrors softened. \u201cI have not slept since my child went where the river goes underground.\u201d\n\nThe silence that followed was not the dramatic kind, rich with waiting for a violin. It was domestic. It placed cups on saucers and waited to see if the tea would overbrew. Yasemin, who had made a thousand mistakes and regretted thirty-seven of them, recognized honesty when it tripped over its own hem and fell into the parlor. She intruded before grief became performance. \u201cWe have brought bread,\u201d she lied, and pulled the paper-wrapped fish sandwich from her bag with reverence and stupidity. \u201cEat. Then we will fight like neighbors.\u201d\n\nEsmeray laughed in spite of herself, a sound that loosened something in the room the way rain releases a smell from the pavement after a long day of being stepped on. She took the sandwich. She did not taste it. She held it as a person holds a thing she knows she is supposed to want. She put it down. The ring on Leyla\u2019s thumb tightened of its own will, then loosened when she refused to notice. The comb sat on the fountain like an instrument that had waited in a corner of a salon for the right hands since 1843.\n\n\u201cYou can sit,\u201d Esmeray said, looking at the throne of leaves and then looking away as if embarrassed by her own arrangements. \u201cOr not. You can walk in the gravel and resent the way it moves. You can call me names. You can give me my ring, which was my grandmother\u2019s and then was mine and then was no one\u2019s in particular. Or you can wear it and be what comes next.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat comes next,\u201d Leyla said, sitting because her knees had suddenly decided to be old, \u201cdoes not have your map. Will you let the water move?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you put your face close enough,\u201d Esmeray said, and this time her smile was brief and brutal and not unkind, \u201cyou will see that even when I stop the surface to spare my heart, the lower water goes. It argues with depth and is always cleverer than me. I am not God, child. I am tired. I am a woman who tried to make a place where nothing would bite. I forgot that if you keep teeth from meat, there is no cooking to talk about.\u201d\n\nLeyla set the carnelian on her tongue as if she had always intended to taste it before returning it. The stone tasted of metal and stone and a hint of smoke that had never been fire. She took it back off and placed it in her palm and felt it choose its warmth. She lifted her hand and watched Esmeray watch it. She breathed and did not ask permission.\n\nWhen she spoke, it was not yet negotiation. It was invitation. It was only the first sentence of a letter she might get to finish if the house was kind and the leaves decided to change their minds and the fountain learned how to complain in a way that did not stop it entirely. She spoke the names she had practiced on the ferry. She did not offer Esmeray her own name yet. That would come. Names need hunger to fit. She took the comb and dragged it through the falling water where Esmeray\u2019s hand had held it still. The teeth cut the stream. The stream rejoined. The beads trembled and fell. The fountain replied to itself. The air smelled like a bruised lemon, like surrender with dignity.\n\n\u201cYou are insolent,\u201d Esmeray said, and her head tilted, and when her head tilted, everything tilted with it, even memory. \u201cGood. Stay, then. Eat my bread. Make a mess. I cannot stop you without making more of a mess. And you, little summer,\u201d she added, looking at Yasemin as if she were a window she might actually want to open, \u201cif you break anything, you will learn how to fix it without help.\u201d\n\n\u201cI break everything,\u201d Yasemin said with a cheerfulness she did not entirely feel. \u201cI am competent with glue.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlue fails,\u201d Esmeray said with the wisdom of a woman who had repaired more plates than afternoons. \u201cThread, on the other hand...\u201d She reached for the braid and half-undid it with a gesture that was not unkind, then changed her mind, put her hands in her lap, and the leaves at her shoulders trembled. \u201cBegin, then,\u201d she said, and this time there was no arrogance in it. There was only fatigue and a kind of curiosity that had weathered grief.\n\nThe garden breathed again. The fountains went on and then paused, then went on. The roses gathered themselves and, at the edges, where the light did not care to look, began to scent. It was the kind of scent you only noticed when you had stood up to go. It told you nothing you could keep. It insisted that what was living would bruise and then would heal. It offered no tiaras and a great deal of work. Leyla unclenched her teeth, only then aware she had been holding them like a key in a door that would not turn. She took up the ring and did not yet decide where it belonged. She would write later. For now, she had to be a body and a breath in a place that had almost forgotten both.\n\nIn the courtyard of a house that claimed to be a garden that pretended to be a house, a witch did what she knew: she made drafts. She placed the comb where it should not go and found out whether the pattern was worth saving. She walked with the gravel and let the crunch be a kind of percussion. She did not pray aloud. The house did not require it. Outside, the city went on being too much. Inside, it was possible to do a small thing well. Outside, lodos lumbered toward evening with sultry shoulders, and bread went stale quicker than it should, and a woman on the Galata steps spat into the wind and thanked God for lungs. Inside, the leaves learned the first letter of no and decided to practice it with grace.",

The fountains learned how to hesitate without locking their knees. When Leyla dragged the olive-wood comb through the falling water again, the teeth found a rhythm that did not so much cut as separate, like a woman parting her children gently before they remembered they were supposed to fight. The stream frayed into threads and then rejoined as if it had always known how. Esmeray watched, not with approval, not with disdain, but with a scholar\u2019s hunger when a student brings an answer that reframes the question entirely. Yasemin walked the gravel until it learned her body and stopped trying to roll her ankles into obedience; she tested the leaves with her fingers, found the places where they were lacquered and the places where they were still sap, then came back to stand by the fountain with a readiness that had nothing to do with violence and everything to do with the belief that she could stick her hand into a stuck machine and not lose it.\n\n\u201cWater listens when it is bored,\u201d Feride had said that morning, pressing their fingers into the tray until the skin of it acknowledged them without drama. In the garden, the water had not been bored in so long it had calcified its own enthusiasm. Now, faced with the comb and a woman who would not turn away from its sulking, it began to remember mischief. The smallest fountain at the far edge burped like a child surprised by its own body. Yasemin giggled and then put her hand to her mouth because giggling here felt like mocking a woman at a funeral. Esmeray\u2019s mouth tipped, unwillingly. The leaves near her shoulder unclasped a single pink at the throat of a white bloom, and then pretended they had not.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d she said, and it was not a command but a dare she placed on the step between them, like a coin that could be picked up by either hand.\n\nThey worked until the light flattened and then tilted toward the upper right the way it does in this city when the sea tells the day to stop being dramatic. The house learned the weight of three women moving in it. It expanded for them and then closed like a fan when they stopped. Doors that had always stayed slightly ajar admitted to their hinge and shut cleanly; others that had never opened creaked in surprise and then swung wide as if not wanting to be judged shy. The mirrors began to be honest. When Yasemin caught herself walking past one and saw her own face undressed of the flirt she wore like a scarf, she lifted her chin and did not reach to arrange herself back into comfort. The gravel, tamed, could be walked barefoot without complaint, if you were the kind of person who forgave stone its nature.\n\nLeyla kept touching the ring and taking her hand away\u2014not because she was undecided, but because she refused to make decisions on the edge of hunger. In the kitchen, there were jars, and in the jars there were legumes whose patient softness, once coaxed, would feed armies. No one had turned the flame under them for a long time. The cold smell came from habit, not from malice. She washed a pot with a cloth that had been folded away since before some wars and lit the stove. The first lick of blue felt like a prayer that did not require agreement. When she poured in the lentils, they made their cheerful rain against the metal, and the sound completed something the air had been trying to say all afternoon. Yasemin, relieved to have a place to put her hands that was neither comb nor leaf, broke onions with a competence born of having watched her mother curse sticky skins half her life. She salted at the right moment because she knew the difference between generosity and waste. When the cumin went in, the house blinked. Esmeray, who had not come into the kitchen in years because kitchens required intimacy with the daily and the daily had betrayed her, stood in the doorway and did not pretend she had been passing by.\n\n\u201cYou are cooking inside my house,\u201d she said, which was either outrage or relief phrased in a way that allowed her to decide later.\n\n\u201cWe are making food where people breathe,\u201d Yasemin said as if that were the only defense anyone ever needed. \u201cSit before the smell makes you think you are being stolen.\u201d\n\nEsmeray did sit, but on the edge as if ready to deny it if anyone wrote it down. When the first steam huffed itself against the windows, her shoulders loosened a degree. She noticed and scolded herself for it without changing her posture. Leyla set the bowls on the table without asking who owned the table; some objects ask their own permission. They ate with the single-mindedness of women who had worked with air all day and needed to be reminded of weight. The lentils were the right kind of soft, the kind that taught your mouth patience and then rewarded it. For the first time since they had climbed the steps, the house smelled of something other than the virtue of restraint.\n\n\u201cThis is witchcraft,\u201d Esmeray said finally, but there was no heat in it. \u201cYou change my water and take my hunger and pretend it was always your right.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo tiaras, only bruises,\u201d Yasemin said with a grin that couldn\u2019t help itself, and when Esmeray frowned in question, she waved a hand. \u201cA proverb I learned yesterday.\u201d\n\nAfter they washed the bowls with water that no longer tried to impress them by holding itself perfectly still, they took out R\u0131za\u2019s stones. Leyla had kept the cloth bundle against the small of her back under her sash where no one would think to steal it. She unknotted it now and placed the three weights in her palm. R\u00fczgar. Sab\u0131r. \u015eifa. They nested in the center of her hand like eggs unrelated to each other and yet sworn to the same weather. When she set them down on the table, the wood thudded with a small authority; the stones had learned how to be louder without raising their voices.\n\n\u201cWhat are these,\u201d Esmeray asked, and for the first time there was unguarded curiosity in her voice. \u201cThey are not talismans. Their vanity is too small.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are names that do not perform,\u201d Leyla said. \u201cR\u0131za said to carry them like bread. One for each of us and one to give away because the moment will recognize itself and if we do not, it will make a fool of us later.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me patience,\u201d Yasemin said immediately, reaching and then stopping herself because the stones were not to be grabbed. She waited, and the waiting pressed a gentle hand to the back of her neck. When she lifted Sab\u0131r, the stone set its weight along the bones of her fingers in a way that made her feel as if she had put on a ring too large even when there was no metal. Her face went quieter without becoming less bright. \u201cI will need it to keep from throwing things at the sea,\u201d she said primly, and no one in the room believed her.\n\n\u201cThe wind is mine,\u201d Leyla said, and took R\u00fczgar, which tried to bounce and then remembered that rocks were dignified and settled. When she slid the last weight forward, it throbbed like pulse under a wrist. \u015eifa. The word smelled like mint and carried the old complaint of winter nights. It wanted a hand that had held too many foreheads and refused to become cruel. It wanted a set of knuckles that had pressed a cloth blister-flat. It wanted intimacy without romance. She looked at Esmeray, not because she thought to give it to her, but because sometimes you must reject the most obvious gesture to make room for the truer one.\n\n\u201cI am not the person who will take your cure,\u201d Esmeray said softly, and did not pretend to be offended. \u201cI am the person who will instruct you on the misery of the cure, and then if I am careful, I will be grateful for it after you have gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we wait,\u201d Leyla said, and slipped the weight back into the fold of the cloth, feeling it settle into the verso of the other two, patient as a neighbor with a story that can afford to ripen.\n\nThe rain that had cast the city into its sulky afternoon dress went to rest in some other quarter where other women opened their windows and scolded it. Evening decided to rehearse. Lodos arrived with his lazy sleeves and his bad mood and his gift for making the cheap glass in a picture frame rattle just enough to recall an old fight. In Kad\u0131k\u00f6y, a boy shoved his best friend and apologized too hard; in Be\u015fikta\u015f, the simit turned dry a beat sooner and the seller cursed not because he lost money but because bread is not supposed to betray you. Down on the ferry decks, a woman who believed she hated the sea checked her watch three times and then stood where the spray could lick her calves, and when she got home she failed to tell anyone why her skirt was damp. In the semahane where tourists had spun and filmed their own holiness, the cleaner laid new water glasses with a precision that would have impressed saints and men with clipboards alike, then scooped the last of yesterday\u2019s salt from the shallow bowls and threw it into a plant in the corner that had been dying in a dignified way. On the Galata steps, the woman who spit thanked God in the old blunt way for lungs, watching the spit ride the wind into someone else\u2019s fate and chuckling because sometimes you must make offerings in the language your body will accept.\n\nIn the yal\u0131, the lodos pressed its face against the windows and fogged them with a slow breath like a donkey\u2019s. It muffled sound without granting quiet. The fountains felt the pressure and thickened a degree. The leaves shifted and then held. Esmeray rose and walked to the largest window, which had been coaxed to grow taller than windows should by a carpenter who knew how to flatter wood into imagination. She put her palm to the glass and the glass admitted her without letting her through. \u201cHe always comes like this,\u201d she said, as if greeting a difficult relative. \u201cHe is not clever, only persuasive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot stop him,\u201d Leyla said without triumph. \u201cYou can open a space for him to exhaust himself without breaking the cups.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not want to open anything,\u201d Esmeray said, and then sighed because now that the pot had been put on the stove there was no use pretending the kitchen did not exist. \u201cBut perhaps we must. If I keep this house clenched, it will grind its teeth down.\u201d\n\nThey stood together, their breath making small fog ovals that touched and separated like shy animals. Yasemin, who had been pretending not to be moved by the drama of wind, ran a finger along the lower frame and lifted up dust as if the house had to blush. She wiped it on her jeans and imagined Zeynep scolding her with a loud tenderness that could be heard in stairwells. The ring on Leyla\u2019s thumb cooled, then warmed, a small animal learning not to fear the hand.\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Leyla said finally, the way a doctor asks a question in a tone that suggests you may lie and is kind enough to accept it if that is what your dignity requires. \u201cYour child.\u201d\n\nEsmeray did not look at her. She looked at the picture the wind was making with the trees outside, a study in force that refused to accept composition. Her voice, when it came, was flat with practice and unexpectedly wet with the first unscripted word. \u201cHe had a name that belonged to the night. I will not give you it. He was soft and then too sharp. He wanted doors and I had already built a room. The river under the city called him the way certain songs call pigeons from places they have no business gathering. I asked for a pause. He gave me an answer. It was not to my taste. I decided to make this house obedient because the world had laughed in my face. You should have seen me then. I was magnificent and impossible to love.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople said they loved you anyway,\u201d Yasemin muttered, not because it was useful, but because the logic of the world irritates and must be named. \u201cThey always say that to women who refuse to organize their tenderness for other people\u2019s comfort.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did,\u201d Esmeray said, and almost smiled. \u201cThey prayed at my doors and asked to be made into statues so no one could come and ask for anything ever again. I sent them away with a loaf of bread. It softened their intentions.\u201d She dropped her hand from the glass as if remembering that the body cannot hold itself upright on refusal alone. \u201cGo to sleep,\u201d she told them, and the word said more than the instruction. \u201cIn the morning, if this wind has not bruised us stupid, we will braid a door and lay it across the water.\u201d\n\nThey did not sleep immediately despite the gift of permission. Lodos makes beds into arguments. The air felt used and personal. Leyla lay with the notebook under her pillow and practiced listing the names the way a child practices letters because her teacher has promised the act of writing will tame the story. R\u0131za had said the purpose was to keep her own name from wandering; she discovered, lying there listening to the house debate with the wind, that her name was not a house to be kept at all but a trail she had to keep from being overgrown by other people\u2019s footsteps. She wrote in her head. Zeynep, who had put citrus oil in the cupboards so mice would call the house rude and leave. Celal, whose long fingers had taught her the length of breath. Hasan, who would marry garlic if it would have him. Sabiha, whose one eye never wandered when money was on the table. R\u0131za, the person who could be a complaint without becoming small. Feride, who trained water into sincerity and then broke it so it would not betray people. Yasemin, who had always found a way to turn her anger into a lemon wedge. She did not add Esmeray. It was too soon for that kind of intimacy.\n\nMorning\u2019s light limped at first and then picked up its kneecaps and came in properly, as if embarrassed at having been caught tired. Lodos had not left, but he stood to the side now, flipping through a newspaper with indifference that he hoped would be mistaken for charm. The city went about its business in a stupor. The men on the bridge cast lines anyway because ritual is often more stubborn than mood. The ferry chugged from dock to dock because if it stopped the city would have to admit to itself what it had become, and no one had time for that on a weekday. In the yal\u0131, the water made its own mind up as to how it would behave. The fountains ran; they paused; they ran again. When Leyla dipped the comb into the first fall, the teeth shivered but did not bite. When she dragged them through, the separation came with ease, as if the house had spent the night teaching itself the lesson it resisted.\n\n\u201cWe take this to the Bosphorus,\u201d she said, because some plans become obvious when sleep unpacks without you. \u201cFeride\u2019s comb is heavy enough to make an argument, polite enough to be listened to. We will not stop the sea. We will not try to teach it. We will ask it to hold a door for a moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople will notice if the water makes a shape,\u201d Yasemin pointed out, knotting her scarf so tight it might have been argument to start a revolution. \u201cThey will assume a TikTok. They will gather. They will throw sunflower seeds and bread meant for gulls and opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will,\u201d Leyla agreed, and smiled because she had never before considered on purpose the useful stupidity of crowds. \u201cSo we must do it where attention is already busy and a shape will look like an accident. The Maiden\u2019s tower. The current dislikes her. It breaks and reformats and forgets what it was trying to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not leaving this house to be toyed with by lodos while my comb cavorts with the sea,\u201d Esmeray said, and then put on her shawl with such finality that both girls hid their grins. \u201cWe are going to the water. I am wearing shoes that were not designed for gods.\u201d\n\nThey took the long steps down past the small men selling larger opinions disguised as umbrellas, past the woman with roses whose frown was proof of self-respect, past the dog who had discovered a patch of sun and was unwilling to give it up even for a more ethical cause. The quay shone like a pan pulled hot off a stove and splashed. The light bounced with too much enthusiasm for a hungover city. The tower sat in its stubborn place in the water and pretended it had never been used for anything but beautiful stories. Boats shouldered each other like cousins in a doorway and then apologized in horn.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Esmeray said, choosing a place where the wall gave way to a set of steps no sensible person took on purpose. \u201cIf you fall, I will not save you, and I will miss you angrily.\u201d\n\n\u201cR\u0131za said to make doors, not proofs of concept,\u201d Yasemin muttered, nevertheless sitting and bracing her feet as if her body had decided not to fall without written permission. The comb came out of Leyla\u2019s bag with the seriousness of a knife at a wedding. She held it across her lap, feeling the color at the tips of the teeth stir. The lodos breathed heavy on the back of her neck and then remembered itself and turned trying to be coy. She lifted the comb and the ring warmed. There was a knot in the air over the water, not seen, but felt\u2014a clenched muscle in the jaw of the strait. She reached for it the way her grandmother had reached for a tangle at the back of her hair on bath nights, gentle until gentleness bored her, then firm with love.\n\nThe first pull did not take. The comb stuttered, as if there was an old net already there, invisible, snagging at the teeth. The second pull found purchase and snagged the snag. A small dark patch rose in the water like a stain coming loose from a shirt that had worn its existence unbothered for years. A boy two steps down laughed because a fish had startled itself; he did not see the sea wince. Leyla dragged, and the current under the surface that had always pretended to ignore instruction shifted a degree to the left and down. The maiden\u2019s tower coughed. A ferry coming in adjusted in a way only the captain felt and then told his friends later in the tea room with a modesty that could not hide his pleasure. Gulls shouted slurs and compliments in equal measure and meant none of them.\n\nThe door was not a door. It was an agreement between moments. It opened, not with hinges or with a sound people could pin to their timeline, but with a soft place where breathing was easier and yelling felt ridiculous. The lodos, fooled for a second into thinking it had achieved its aim, leaned in and then, finding no purchase, leaned back with wounded pride. Down the steps, an old man with a pigeon on his shoulder paused mid-step, blinked, and the pigeon decided not to spread its wings just then for reasons of its own. He looked at the women with the comb and the scarves and the stubbornness and recognized nothing and everything at once. He put his free hand on his chest and bowed because sometimes your body knows how to thank a stranger who has saved you the trouble of crying later. Leyla felt the weight in her bag twitch. The cloth around \u015eifa tugged.\n\n\u201cGive it,\u201d Yasemin whispered, and when Leyla turned, her friend\u2019s face had none of its usual trouble-making bent. It had quiet. \u201cIf you do not, your hands will smell of mint all day and the city will go sore by evening and you will say, why did I do this to us.\u201d\n\nLeyla stood and climbed the two steps toward the old man as if going to prayer. The stone under her feet, slick with the sweating of the day, decided not to be spiteful. She placed the small cloth bundle in his palm. He made a shape of refusal and then accepted because refusing a gift given by a woman who is clearly arguing with the sea is vulgar. He did not open it. He held it to the soft meat over his heart and nodded as if agreeing to carry a baby for a minute so a mother can sling her bag. \u201cK\u0131z\u0131m,\u201d he said, and his voice was warm as walnut. \u201cYou know the wind. May God make your bones patient and your roof not leak.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay your bird find letters that do not have to be read to tell what they mean,\u201d she answered softly, surprised by the way the words had waited behind her teeth like water behind a palm. The pigeon peered at her and made a small noise that might have been a secret delivered and immediately forgotten.\n\nThe door held as long as it needed to. The comb came away without complaint. The water forgot as politely as it had agreed. Leyla wiped the teeth on the hem of her shirt without thinking about it and tried not to imagine Feride inspecting the comb later with one eyebrow lifted. Esmeray\u2019s mouth was not empty at the corners for a full breath. It held the smallest ghost of grease from the sandwich and of gratitude.\n\n\u201cYou meddle beautifully,\u201d she said, which might have been the most honest sentence she had said since they stepped into her house. \u201cNow that you have given away your cure, you will have to learn new ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe only gave away the one that needed to go,\u201d Yasemin said, and the certainty in her voice came from the moment the little weight had left their keeping; she had not known she had been carrying her shoulders near her ears until they dropped back into usefulness. \u201cThe others will find us. We are sheep in a village with too many shepherds.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are goats,\u201d Esmeray corrected absently. \u201cYou eat what will kill you and then look surprised when you are stronger for it.\u201d She took the comb with a care that almost masked her greed and tucked it back into Leyla\u2019s bag herself, a gesture that insisted on intimacy, and then drew her hand away with the swiftness of someone who realizes what they have admitted. The ring on Leyla\u2019s thumb cooled into a question. The house on the hill shrugged its ivy and pretended it had not been watching like an aunt at a window.\n\nThey climbed back up through the day, which had thickened now into a syrup of opinions and relief. Market men argued their way into sales. Women carved paths with hips and shopping bags and generosity. A boy with roses offered a blossom, then denied it, then offered it again because he could not decide if life was a trick or a negotiation. When he thrust it under Leyla\u2019s nose, the ring hummed. She took the rose because saying no would have made the boy feel like the city had chosen a side against him. She paid, and he made change, and the look he gave her when they both fumbled coins as if fingers were ornaments only, told her something new about names: that sometimes you carry another person\u2019s for a minute when they are too tired to hold it.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill the semahane gate stood open to air it out after tourist holiness. The cleaner, a woman with wrists like clever loaves of bread, bent to pick up a stray water glass and placed it with the others as if each had cost her a day of her life. She glanced up. There was no recognition because people who keep places real do not insist on witnessing the dramatic. She smiled anyway, a pragmatic curve that meant, I see you carrying foolishness; may it not crush your lungs. Yasemin almost stopped and then did not, because she would cry as if she had invented crying and it would embarrass them both.\n\nIn the yal\u0131, the house had arranged itself into the version of itself that admitted that living was not a habit to be cut off. The kitchen smelled unabashedly of food now, even after the windows had been opened to let lodos sniff and pass. A bowl that had been put away for silverfish to nibble on had migrated to the counter. The bed in the small room they had claimed ceased behaving like an exam. When Leyla set the rose in a chipped glass, it drooped its head with a drama that made her laugh; a moment later, it decided it had been hasty and lifted an inch with resolve.\n\nIn the afternoon, with the city slow and the air undecided, they learned how to braid doors. Esmeray had not called it that; she had called it \u201ctying off air\u201d in a tone that suggested it was what one did for a crying child when all the adults were tired. But when she showed them how\u2014three strands of ribbon, one of silk stolen off her old dresses, one of old upholstery striping, one of the kind of cheap cloth you buy at a market when you believe you are being thrifty and are in fact being hopeful\u2014it made a shape that remembered braids on a child\u2019s head and knew it was more than memory. They measured the doorway not with a tape but with breath, crossing the threshold back and forth until the body knew the width without confessing it needed to count. When they tied the braid across, the house sighed. You cannot hang a net in melancholy and expect it to catch anything but the shadow of what might have wanted to be caught. They hung their net in insolence and useful joy, and it held the day without arresting it.\n\n\u201cEvery door has a stubborn place,\u201d Esmeray said, supervising as if she were trying to keep the impulse to snatch the work from their hands under a scarf. \u201cLike a woman\u2019s lower back. Rub there, not hard, not soft. The door will pretend not to notice. It will forgive you later.\u201d\n\nThey rubbed. The braid settled. A draft that had always bullied the corner at floor level found itself reassigned to the top; it went more slowly and with more grace, and in doing so admitted it had always wanted to be more civilized. The dust that took this corner as its own agreed to let the rest of the house breathe, on condition that no one mocked it for its failures. The leaf nearest the threshold, which had been lacquer for years, exhaled and became plant for one difficult second, and then went back, the way people return to old behaviors at the first whiff of trouble and need to be coaxed out with laughter and tea.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Esmeray, looking at the ring with frankness and the smallest flash of appetite, \u201cyour true offering.\u201d\n\nLeyla rolled the carnelian with its lightning crack between thumb and forefinger until the warmth it gathered was hers, not the room\u2019s. When she took it off and set it on the table, the stone lost a degree of heat like an animal stepping into shade. It did not try to run. It did not fold. It sat and let itself be seen. The letters inside it lay down, then stood up, then smirked and turned their backs like schoolchildren daring a teacher. She and Esmeray looked at it like a man and a woman look at a child who is neither of theirs and might still ruin both of their lives. The weight of its history pressed into the wood and nicked it.\n\n\u201cIt belonged to your grandmother,\u201d Leyla said, and refused to make her tone jealous. \u201cHer name was the kind that calls the fox, not the prayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer name would make birds go silent when she walked into a room,\u201d Esmeray said. \u201cShe wore the ring because a woman who refuses to soften must remind the world she knows how to be gentle with her own ill fortune. It was a piece of all the words we never say aloud. It is yours,\u201d she added abruptly, as if tearing a thread that had gotten caught on the wrong hook. \u201cIt is yours because this house did what I asked it to for too long and now it cannot ignore the fact that it likes you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything stolen returns eventually,\u201d the old woman at the well had said, dry enough to crack. Leyla picked the ring up and did not place it back on her thumb. She put it in her pocket, not like a thief, but like someone who knows that wearing a jewel is not the only way to carry it. The relief that ran through the house came like rain through a screen\u2014a hundred small cold kisses on skin that had expected only heat. She exhaled. Esmeray did not, and then she did.\n\n\u201cWhat will you do,\u201d Yasemin said, turning her face toward the window as if interviewing a bird. \u201cWhen we leave. Because we will. We have to go back and teach Hasan how to tell if a fig has lied. We have to keep Celal from turning your story into a riddle he will never answer. We have to remind R\u0131za to eat and that they are not required to be a complaint every other day. We have to bring apricots to Zeynep and make ourselves available for scolding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will I do,\u201d Esmeray repeated, and tasted the question as if it came salted and then decided it did not upset her palate. \u201cI will sleep in the kitchen once and make my back hurt and discover it is not the end of the world. I will let the women who sweep the mosque steps come in and have tea without my telling them how to hold their cups. I will go down to the quay when lodos pretends he is poetry and shout at him like a fishwife and impress no one and improve my lungs. I will become an aunt to the gulls. I will let the roses smell only at the edges and forgive them for refusing to center themselves in my plans. I will get bored of certainty and then relaunch my career as a difficulty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will write,\u201d Leyla said, and slid the notebook onto the table. \u201cNot for men with libraries. Not for prayer. For your own name, so it remembers which rooms to visit and which to pass by.\u201d\n\nEsmeray looked at the soft brown cover like it was a child offering her a spoon with a worm on it. \u201cYou are impertinent,\u201d she said, and there was no malice. \u201cGive me the pen. It has been centuries since ink embarrassed me.\u201d\n\nThey let the afternoon be the kind that does not get written about because it is not dramatic enough for men\u2019s tongues. They set up the bowls for Ebru on the small back balcony where the Bosphorus set the tempo and where the gulls coming in off the flat of the sea did not care who watched them scratch. Feride\u2019s comb, newly disobedient, remembered what it had learned about bending without dishonor. Yasemin stirred the tragacanth into the water with a patience she swore she had not acquired and which the stone in her pocket smirked at her about. The first papers they pulled were ugly, and they loved them for it. The next were pretty, and they ruined them, and in the ruining found relief. A boy below tried to sell them chestnuts before realizing the season had mistimed itself. He laughed at his own hustle and then remembered he could make money and shouted again.\n\nAt dusk, a hush that was not the hush of stalled breath but the hush of shared fatigue took the corners of the house and braided them together. Zeynep\u2019s lemon sat imagined on the counter across the city, sending its ghost ahead. The ezan rose somewhere in the neighborhood with the old confidence that says, even if the voice cracks and the radio gives out and a gull shits on the loudspeaker, time will be held between two hands and hand back to you without being precious. They did not pray; they took the time and let it sit, instinctively protecting it from opinions.\n\nWhen the first star decided to be seen despite the city\u2019s lights insisting they are more important, Yasemin rolled on her back on the carpet and refused to move. \u201cIf we do not leave soon, I will marry this house,\u201d she announced, and it was such an obscene thought that all three women burst into the kind of laughter that scrubs varnish off grief and lets it breathe. Afterwards, when their throats were raw and their cheeks wet and no one wanted to be the first to admit to needing water, they were quiet again.\n\n\u201cYou will go in the morning,\u201d Esmeray said, not because she wanted them to, but because the words had grown heavy and needed to be lifted. \u201cYou will take my ring and your insolences and the comb that no longer obeys me and you will stop the wind from treating your village like a chest it can push its knee against until the lock gives. You will bring me apricots that taste like a child\u2019s summer. You will leave me alone here with my house and my stubbornness and my desire to keep everything perfect and my discovery that it was killing us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come,\u201d Yasemin blurted, and then realized she had said the dangerous thing when she looked at Leyla and saw her friend\u2019s face open with the terror of a woman who knows invitations are flew arrows that cannot be caught without consequences.\n\n\u201cI cannot,\u201d Esmeray said, very gently, as if stepping sideways to avoid stepping on a kitten. \u201cNot yet. The house has agreed to practice saying no without clawing. If I leave now, it will go find a priest and pretend to be good. It will show him its mirrors. He will faint. We will never live it down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn spring,\u201d Leyla said, surprising herself. \u201cWhen the wind forgets to have an agenda for three days in a row. When the goats are unworried and the bread refuses to stale. Come then. Watch the stone breathe. We will argue gently with the well until it gives us all our fish back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will try,\u201d Esmeray said, and her eyes did not slip away. \u201cI will be the aunt you cannot get rid of. I will insult Hasan\u2019s tomatoes and teach your old men how to hold their insults like olives, not bullets.\u201d\n\nSleep, when it finally came, came clean. Lodos muttered outside like an uncle who has been told to stop singing and is thinking of sneaking in one more verse anyway. Inside, the braided threshold held the draft without pride. The leaves ceased performing and worked quietly at their work. The water ran without guilt. In the small room, Leyla dreamed of writing her name not on paper but on the inside of her wrist where pulse lives and where a woman can lift her hand to her mouth and look and remember without anyone being invited to the remembering. In the same house, a woman who had decided to finish the night safely awake fell asleep on the kitchen bench with her shawl over her knees and one hand on the table where the ring had been. Her mouth did not smile. It did not need to. It had learned a new resting shape that did not insist on being tragic.\n\nIn the morning, the city pretended it had always intended to be at ease. Poyraz cleaned up after lodos like a conscientious younger sibling. Ferries moved with their chests out. The pigeons did what pigeons do when no one asks them to help tell a story. They drank thin water from the seams between stones and forgot to fly until a child ran. On the quayside, the old man with the bird on his shoulder opened the cloth and found the stone. He did not know the word it said and did not need to. He put it in his pocket beside a string he had knotted thirty years ago. The bird pecked his ear, offended to have been not consulted, and he laughed out loud, making three people nearby believe they had now been blessed against small misfortunes for the day.\n\nThey packed. It is a trial to pack a house into a bag when the house has decided it will lend you some of its tricks if you promise to return them clean. The comb slid into its pocket rich with misbehavior. The papers, warping slightly because water is a clingy lover, lay between shirts and learned how to sit properly. The notebook went to the top where it could see. The ring stayed in Leyla\u2019s pocket where small coins and the odd apricot pit live and learn the politics of the intimate. At the door, the braid bowed as if inviting them to step over a story\u2019s threshold without making fools of themselves. Yasemin kissed her fingers and touched the braid. She would never admit later that she did.\n\nThey said their goodbyes without letting them become monuments. Esmeray hugged them each like a mistake she wanted to repeat. She did not kiss their cheeks because her mouth did not belong to anyone in that moment and she respected it for that. When they stepped into the bright nonsense of the day, the house closed its eyes and opened them again and did not trap anyone between its lids.\n\nAt the ferry, the man with simit stacked on his head had a joke he had been saving for two days and found that it refused to land, so he tucked it back behind his ear for later. The sea performed its complicated obligations. The city supplied actors and props and the right amount of rust. On deck, Yasemin leaned her elbows on the rail and let the wind slap her until she forgave it for future crimes. Leyla took out the notebook and wrote one line that tasted like metal and then honey and then dust. Then she stopped, because sometimes one line is enough map for a week if you know how to walk. On the other side, the bus would be impatient. On the other side of that, their village would pretend it had not been holding its breath, and then it would remember to be offended that they were late. She felt the ring in her pocket and refused to touch it out of a superstition she had not had yesterday and would deny tomorrow.\n\nAs the ferry cut, a door they could not see opened and closed in the seam between waters and men with hats who think they understand waters. No one clapped. Far away, in a library that smelled like paper that had forgiven rain, Celal Hoca put his finger on a line of Rumi and then lifted it again, having decided not to misunderstand a metaphor for once. In Konya, R\u0131za drank water and found it colder than it needed to be, smiled into the rim of the glass, and said, \u201cAh.\u201d In a kitchen where the soap had decided to finally lather properly, Zeynep stared at the lemon and did not cut it because sometimes you must leave one thing untransformed in a day so the day can find its way back to itself at night. In a yal\u0131 with leaves that had agreed to grow their own minds back one centimeter at a time, a woman stood in the doorway and glanced at the place where three heads had been last night and shook her head like a horse after a fly has left.\n\nOn the bus, the seats were upholstered in arguments that smelled faintly of cigarettes and prayers. A man with municipal swagger had lost it and was pretending he had put it down on purpose. A little boy practiced tying a knot and failed beautifully, then presented his failure to his mother like a flower newly invented. The road out of the city made its long slippy promise. Leyla took the window. She let the currents of morning, of wind and of the people who believed they were immune to both, press against the glass and turn into view. She would go home and argue with a well. She would hang a braid across a door between hot and cold. She would take a comb to the edge of a fountain and teach it that edges are not prisons. She would become a larger place for breath and make her mother complain she was letting in too much weather. She would insist on bruises and rinse them clean. She would keep writing her name until the page learned how to hold it without tightening.\n\nNear the outskirts, a woman who worked nights cleaning a semahane leaned against a wall, closed her eyes, and felt a small headache decide not to be born. She smiled because she would get to keep her patience for a son who would surely require all of it later. In the square, Hasan found that figs had decided to arrive without fanfare. He put one to his nose and measured the distance between now and the afternoon when he would eat it, then made the proper face because men like him must pretend they are not so easily made happy lest the world try to turn it into a joke. In the old yard, a pomegranate tree lifted. In the room where the bread\u2019s cracks mapped the fields, Babaanne Sabiha tilted her head like a bird and said to no one, \u201cThey have gone and come back already, that is what it feels like. My bones know their own grandchildren. Someone bring me my needle.\u201d\n\nOn the road, the bus shuddered over a seam and then remembered itself. The driver spat out the window and polished his mirror with a rag the color of a bad argument. Yasemin fell asleep with her mouth open, angelic in a way that would make her grit her teeth if told. Leyla kept watch, not because the road needed her, but because keeping watch is sometimes the only way to arrive with a story intact. She pressed her palm flat against the glass and felt the city fall off her skin like rain. When the first chimneys rose from the land in the distance like teeth in the generous jaw of the earth, she smiled. A wind out of habit tried to push her backwards and then realized its mistake and came up behind her like a friend hurrying to catch up.\n\nAt the gate of the yard, the pomegranate bowed and then shrugged because it was busy. Zeynep in the kitchen did not look up when the latch lifted; she said instead, \u201cElini y\u0131ka,\u201d and then added, \u201cDid you bring me my lemon back,\u201d and when Leyla stepped in and held out her hands like a child who has learned new manners, Zeynep glanced and knew in one instant that a daughter can leave to a city where wind pretends to be the only story and still come home wearing the right dust. The ring stayed in its pocket. The comb slept. The stones clicked once like cousins in the back seat. Showered in the light that belongs only to the plateau, Leyla breathed, and the breath did not behave like magic. It behaved like breath. It was enough.",

                              "content": "The day after their return wore its ordinary like a newly washed shirt, clean and familiar and still creased along the seams where the hands had pressed and smoothed. The pomegranate tree at the gate bowed in its old way, not theatrical, only respectful to the morning and to whatever news the wind had tucked under the leaves. In the kitchen the kettle made the sound of stories being persuaded to return to the mouth, and Zeynep, who had made a kingdom out of plates and hands, tilted her head the way women tilt their heads when they have counted the number of breaths in a room and found one too many. Leyla washed, the water running over her palms with a coolness that felt like admission. The ring in her pocket warmed, then remembered itself, then cooled; it behaved like an animal trying not to announce that it had come to live in a human house. On the low couch, Sabiha shifted her scarf, the knot under her chin neat as a signature, and watched her granddaughter with one clouded eye that roamed and one sharp eye that had never missed a chance to tuck truth under the edge of a tablecloth when guests came.\n\n\u201cYou smell of salt and someone else\u2019s kitchen,\u201d Zeynep said, sliding olives from their bath into a bowl with a speed that feared interruption, then kissing her teeth as if the salt had spoken out of turn. \u201cEat and then we will see what you have brought back that you should not have and what you lost that you will pretend you never wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought back the wind in a better mood,\u201d Leyla said, which was both true and the kind of sentence that made her mother sigh because it did not solve anything you could put on a shelf. She did not take out the ring. She did not touch it. She took bread and broke it, and the steam climbed her face with the mild possessiveness of an old friend who pretends not to be surprised you have returned alive.\n\n\u201cYou left me with milk that fought the pot and a neighbor who came to complain about her husband\u2019s snoring as if I am the registrar for other people\u2019s foolishness,\u201d Sabiha put in, her spoon already busy with cheese as if it had been built to translate dairy into bruises and triumphs. \u201cThe needle stayed awake last night. It pricked me for being bored. Something has turned its face the right way, k\u0131z\u0131m. If you tell me you did nothing, I will spit, and you know my spitting works.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nazars in the market faced the wall last time,\u201d Leyla said, watching the way tea made a light when poured from a height and thinking that perhaps everything she owned should be taught to arc without spilling. \u201cToday they will remember what their eyes are for. We go to the well.\u201d\n\nThey did not hurry because the village did not respect haste unless it involved stoves, lambing, or rumors. On the street, children made stones into worlds and the world into a stone; the old men on the bench under the fig tree pretended to be uninterested in the weather and then debated lodos with a scholarship that would have put proper teachers to shame. Yasemin walked beside Leyla with that manipulable brightness that had carried them through rooms that refused laughter. She had the Sab\u0131r stone in her pocket like a new pact; it sat against her thigh and made a gentle weight that taught her to stop lifting one shoulder in impatience at the sound of other people chewing. \u201cYour mother will not forgive me if we make a scene,\u201d she said solemnly, then flashed her teeth because forgiveness and scene-making were two foods she had survived on for years.\n\nPer\u015fembe Pazar\u0131 had shrugged on its necessary confusion. Hasan, sleeves rolled, hair a thesis on how to make sunlight behave, leaned into his stall with more swagger than he had change for and greeted them as if they had been gone a season, not a handful of days. \u201cYou left,\u201d he said, putting two figs aside with a flourish he hoped looked accidental, \u201cand the figs sulked. They arrived this morning to apologize. I told them the witches had returned and they feigned eating their shame, which is to say they sat there and looked edible.\u201d His smile faltered the smallest degree when the string of blue glass eyes behind him creaked and turned outward with the confidence of a guest who finally understands which direction the door is. \u201cAllah Allah,\u201d he breathed, then slapped the counter as if flattering an animal into obedience. \u201cYou bring me luck or you bring me trouble, cad\u0131. Either way, I will sell out of tomatoes and pretend it was skill.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need ribbon,\u201d Leyla said, and Hasan\u2019s cousin, who had a box of everything that could tie and a knowledge of exactly how long each piece should be for every occasion including funerals and baby showers and goats that refused their pegs, slid bundles across the counter. They took silk the color of old leaves that refuse to fall, and stout cotton the shade of kitchen tile at dusk, and a roll of something that had once been upholstery and now wanted redemption. \u201cAnd rope,\u201d Yasemin added, \u201cfor men who will swear they did not ask to be tied to our cause and then will wail when we leave them to wander into ditches of their own building.\u201d Hasan wrapped the ribbons neatly, then ruined the neatness by tucking in a paper twist of walnuts when no one was looking and told himself he had been forced.\n\nHoca Celal met them at the lip of the well with that long-suffering look he wore when his faith in order was being asked to sit on a small stool and watch women rearrange the furniture. He had in his hand a book he clearly did not intend to open and a bundle of mint he clearly did. The wives at the well, skirts tucked, arms bare to the elbow, eyed the gathering with the useful suspicion of people who have yet to be convinced that a ritual will make their laundry easier. The circle of stones breathed up its cool breath; if you bent close you could smell somewhere far down the deep, a bitter resin smell like a secret trade. The wrong rainbow was gone and not gone. When you glanced, it had corrected itself; when you looked hard, you saw odd bands shifting places like cousins stealing one another\u2019s shoes. A woman who had lost a ring last year under the quince tree and had sworn she would never stop cursing until the ring returned, turned her face away from Leyla out of superstition and then turned it back out of curiosity because no one had the patience to cling to their own curses these days.\n\n\u201cWe will not pour anything into the water,\u201d Leyla said softly, because the well had a temper that respected soft voices and mocked loud ones. \u201cWe will not put gum or glue or even good intentions. We will comb the air above it so it remembers how to part and rejoin. We will hang a braid across its mouth so that what should pass does and what should linger is made to admit its motive. We will ask for names. We will feed the names back in their proper shape instead of letting them sink and ferment into bad advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is new,\u201d Celal said, and he was not being sarcastic; he was placing his mind where it belonged, at the angle where questions do not look like weapons. \u201cTeach me where to stand so I do not cast a shadow where a woman\u2019s hands are working.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will hold the mint,\u201d Yasemin told him, putting him to useful work before his intellect could invent a problem, \u201cand you will scold anyone who tries to spit. And if the stone grumbles, you will say, \u2018Eyvallah, elder,\u2019 and mean it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEyvallah,\u201d he said obediently, and the word fit his mouth like an old step fits a foot.\n\nThey braided at the edge of the circle, not to bind, not to fence, but to lay over like the shawls Sabiha wore when winter thought it would get its way. Silk lay against cotton against the stubborn strip that had been meant for sofas and now pleased itself by being a threshold. As they measured, walking around the well until their feet knew the circumference better than their heads, the village brought offerings that were not offerings but the daily turned holy because of how it arrived. A child brought two white stones and the conviction that one had been invaluable to him yesterday and that he could live without it today. A boy brought an old marble from his father\u2019s boyhood, nicked and too large for modern games. A woman set down a lemon slice and then changed her mind, lifted it, kissed it, and returned it to her pocket because some acids belong to the pot. A man brought nothing and then, embarrassed, took off the ring that had worn his finger thin where his mother had measured his adulthood by whether he wore it and set it lightly on the stone for one breath before reclaiming it, which was enough.\n\n\u201cSay their names,\u201d Leyla asked, and the saying began at the edges and then caught. They did not pour names down the well as if names were trash to be blinded; they said them into the braided air. Names have flight. Names know when they are welcomed as guests and when they are being asked to behave like laundry. Women said the names of their children with that elaborate simplicity that contains all sorrows that have not happened yet. Old men said the names of their brothers and pretended not to taste the war in their own mouths. Hasan said his grandmother\u2019s name and then, loud enough to be teased, the name of a woman who had not yet agreed to scold him for the rest of his life. The boys stole each other\u2019s names as jokes and the names returned home with muddy knees and grass stains and a promise to wash.\n\nWhen the wind, which had rushed ahead of itself on the plateau like a goat unsupervised, came to the lip of the well and found the braid, it hesitated in the way a bully hesitates before good manners and a chair and a woman who will not move her knee. Leyla lifted Feride\u2019s comb and held it above the mouth, the olive teeth catching light like simple instruments made by men who loved wood more than they loved women or God. She dragged the comb through nothing and everything both, and the air separated by the width of patience, which is neither wide nor narrow but exactly the shape of what it must allow. The first pass whispered; the second pass spoke. The third pass opened a place where the wrong rainbow relaxed its shoulders and remembered to be a trick of light and not a signature of grief.\n\n\u201cHaydi,\u201d Leyla said, and the word, which in other mouths means hurry, arrived here as a permission to proceed with dignity. The water in the well did not froth and did not make a show. It acknowledged in the small way old water does: a release of two bubbles like a child waking and deciding not to cry, and the faintest ripple that betrayed a current below accepting a new habit. Celal breathed out and let the mint cool his tongue and said nothing because sometimes a hoca\u2019s best work is to be quiet where women can hear their own yes.\n\nSomeone down the lane yelled because a goat had found the bag of flour left like a dare on the doorstep, and laughter made a quick rain across the square because there are disasters you are allowed to enjoy. A tourist couple tried to photograph the well and failed, not because magic dislikes being seen, but because the air does not love strangers more than it loves the old women who have carried it in and out of houses long enough to make it behave. Sabiha had taken her chair to the shade and threaded a needle without theater, then threaded it again when it refused to be honest, and was nodding to herself like a queen when the stitch went clean without a knot on the backside. \u201cWakefulness suits us,\u201d she announced to her own lap, and then louder so that the well could hear and stop sulking. \u201cThe needle remembered. The day is in its place.\u201d\n\nThey hung the braid and left it to speak above the stones in a voice that would not make itself hoarse. Children were allowed to touch it if they did not tug. Men who joked at it were reminded to behave themselves by looks that women had perfected over centuries of reminding and rarely needing to resort to hitting. On the way to the market for bread that had not yet lost its right to be called bread, the nazars along the lane blinked outward and dared flies to like themselves. Oil dripped from a simit that had been bitten with the greed of someone who had not eaten since the news returned that their village was still exactly here. The fig in Hasan\u2019s hand was the precise measure of ripeness that convinces a person they are loved by a universe that made bees first and opinions last. He licked his thumb dramatically and then stopped performing because sometimes food requires you to be sincere. He pushed a fig into Yasemin\u2019s palm and did not pretend it was free. She took it and did not pretend she was doing him a favor by accepting.\n\nAt noon the wind tried a trick it had learned in the city. It threw its shoulder against the top of the lane to create a little storm that would make laundry slap itself silly on lines and minds refuse to settle for the quiet that comes after the midday call. The braid at the well made a low sound like a woman telling a secret you already know and reminding you to act surprised for courtesy\u2019s sake. The dust came and then found itself embarrassed and went into corners and tried to change the subject. The goats acknowledged the moment by lifting their heads and then, finding nothing delicious in it, returned to their chewing with the kind of contempt only goats and bureaucrats can perfect. The bread in Zeynep\u2019s kitchen did not stale before its time. The lemons sat without commentary. The pot behaved. The neighbor with the snoring husband decided to fold her laundry twice instead of beginning a new complaint.\n\nIn the library Celal set his book down open on a verse he had always misread as an order and now realized was an invitation. He touched the page the way he had touched the mint, with homogeneous reverence. The line that used to mean \u201cstop\u201d gentled itself into \u201cstay.\u201d He scribbled in the margin as if his own handwriting could be forgiven for deciding not to be a weapon today. He had expected to be the repository of what had happened, a clean jar labeled and placed on an appropriate shelf. He found instead that he was a window, and that the work of being a window is exhausting and holy and it makes a man grateful for women who invent curtains that do not darken the room.\n\nThe day, having been prevented from becoming melodramatic, proceeded with a competence that made people forget to be grateful until they lay down and found themselves surprised by how little their heads hurt. Hasan shorted himself one ring of simit by giving it to a child who did not ask; later he would swear the ledger corrected itself when he blinked, and Zeynep would snort and say he was an optimist and a liar. A hen laid an egg in the exact spot where the children had buried a coin under a stone last year and forgotten it; the egg did not break and the coin was recovered, and no one called it a sign because signs are a habit that eats time you need for cooking. Sabiha took a nap that did not invite ancient conversations to sit on her chest. She dreamed of a river without the embarrassment of a city sitting on it, a river that only wanted to be river, and she woke and said aloud for the benefit of anyone who would fold her words into later decisions, \u201cGood. Let the water be wise in its own small way.\u201d\n\nIn the evening, with the day\u2019s heat shambling off into the low ravines to gossip with sunset about goats and bread, they tried the comb on the village fountain. There was no marble, only stone that had learned six different decades of hands and believed itself to be more generous than it had been last week. Men with tea cups stood at an angle that suggested they were too polite to stare and too honest to pretend they were not curious. Leyla held the comb at a height no one could call sacrilegious and drew it through the falling water in a measured stroke that promised to close wounds without leaving a scar to be admired. The fountain did not freeze; it forgot, briefly, that it had spent all day moving, then remembered, then laughed in the only way a fountain can laugh, which is by splashing a woman who did not intend to be splashed and making children shriek because they have internal barometers for joy. The sound of the water changed, not by much, only enough that the flirtation it had been conducting with gravity since morning acquired a respect that would last through the hard hours before dawn.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Zeynep said calmly, and that gentle authority that had prevented ten thousand small disasters from becoming large took hold of the air. She wiped the splash from her daughter\u2019s cheek with the corner of her apron and failed to scold. \u201cIf the fountain is going to laugh, let it do it outside where there is space for foolishness. My stove is for sobriety.\u201d\n\nThat night there was no dream of a garden. There was the kind of sleep that comes like a committee of unheard-of saints and sits in the corners and agrees that for once, nothing terrible needs to be planned. There was the settling of the house into its ordinary joints. There was the ring in the pocket that pulsed and then chose to be quiet like a guest who could either call attention or do the beautiful work of not needing to be seen. There was the sensation of reprieve, which is not the same as salvation and often kinder. In a city far off that had grown its own mouth, a woman with leaves crawling up her windows wrote two sentences in a notebook she had been too proud to touch for too long, and then tore the page out and burned it, not because the sentences were bad, but because she did not want anyone to read them improperly and think her heart was made of simple clay.\n\nThe morning caught the village with its hair in its mouth and could not decide whether to laugh or call for mothers. The braid over the well had settled, silk waiting for someone to invent a reason to stroke it. Children who could be trusted to fetch water without rearranging the world were sent with jugs and disciplinary glances; they returned with cheeks like polished apples and the serious air of citizens entrusted with a country. Men exhaled and sat in their own chairs without pretending they had earned them that morning; women let their hands be briefly empty and allowed one another to see it. Leyla went to Hoca Celal with two papers from the balcony in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar and laid them down on the table without the apology untrained artists make when they present their first failures. The marblings had dried into their own minds, messy and dignified. He set his spectacles on his nose and let the color talk to him about a language he might never speak and would anyway impose on students later with the gentleness he saved for the young and the breakable.\n\n\u201cYou made one door in the city and one here,\u201d he said after a long minute during which he had considered whether it was polite to be moved in front of girls you had taught to read under the table. \u201cDo you intend to keep it open forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leyla said, and was grateful to hear the certainty arrive without her having to go looking. \u201cDoors are for movement, not for bragging. We open and close. We will not build a museum of our accomplishments and trap the day inside. We will go to Hasan and buy figs for the old woman whose teeth will not cooperate and we will mash them with walnuts and say we invented medicine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u015eifa went,\u201d he observed, not reaching for the stone she did not have. \u201cHe was the right person to carry it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a name we did not know we had,\u201d she said, and the pleasure of discovering that a decision had been good sat down in her throat where sarcasm usually kept its chair. \u201cThere will be more. The city is a pocketful waiting to be counted. Konya has its own pockets. You are not the only careful person hiding thread.\u201d\n\nThey were interrupted by the boy who looked as if everything that had ever happened had been his idea. He came to the library door with a reluctance that betrayed an old-fashioned respect stitched along the edges of a new, cheap arrogance. \u201cHoca,\u201d he called, then saw Leyla and corrected himself with a theater that made her want to clap. \u201cAblam. The nazars at the mosque turned and then turned back and then turned again, and the imam says if we are going to keep them dizzy, we should at least give them tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive the nazars tea,\u201d Celal said gravely, nodding until he had convinced himself he had always intended to be this ridiculous and that it did not diminish him. \u201cAnd turn them yourself with your two hands, with the understanding that you are agreeing to carry a little of what they carry for as long as they look outward. Do not do things to people you will not do for yourself. That includes beads, stones, and wives.\u201d\n\nThe boy puffed at the last word and looked sideways at Leyla as if expecting her to be the sort of woman who thinks putting men in their place is a sport without risk. She spared him and walked out with her palms open like a person whose hands are clean. At the mosque wall the eyes hung, a string of sky, the blue worn by fingers and sun into a true color, deep as the kind of ocean no one in the village had seen. She reached and steadied them, not turning them as you turn an argument, but righting them as you right a cup that has tipped because someone laughed and knocked it and did not mean harm. They faced the street with their unblinking courtesy. She let her fingers rest a second longer than habit, as if telling a frightened child, \u201cBak, I am here. Be useful.\u201d\n\nBy the week\u2019s end the village had organized itself around the fact that the wind had been taught a new trick and could be made to like it. The women began, with grudging smiles, to copy Zeynep\u2019s braided threshold across courtyards and front rooms and stables; the first few were crooked and hung with a humility that made children proud of them as if they had drawn them on walls with chalk. Men claimed they had invented the ribbons because men cannot resist inventing anything that can be twisted and knotted, and women allowed them to talk until they forgot what they had claimed and then quietly fixed the knots to hold. The well, which had been in a mood for a season as if it had eaten the wrong mushrooms at a festival, stayed civil. The water had a new taste that no one could name because it belonged to no fruit and no flower; it tasted like a day that would not be hijacked by a sound from far away.\n\nAt dusk one night the wind tried to bring dust from the lower fields where the new machine had bitten and spat and left the earth with its hair cut wrong. The braid hummed. The first grains lifted in their habitual caravan and then dropped, embarrassed to be caught without elegance. Goats with opinions stood on vantage points and bleated as if delivering judgment; a woman in a doorway laughed at them and told them to come down before they imagined themselves eagles and leaped. A small disaster\u2014two boys and a red bicycle\u2014attempted to learn gravity among the lanes and failed to get hurt, and a grandmother sitting under a pomegranate tree nodded once in the way of people who know the cost of luck and never spend it all in one place.\n\nIt did not last without friction. An aunt with a stubborn mouth came to Zeynep and said the house had begun to move in the night and she did not trust houses that move; she preferred men that move and houses that keep their promises. A cousin insisted the braid was ugly and hung like the tongue of a dog who has run too far to be trusted with a baby. A man announced at the tea garden that if women would discuss these matters with proper authorities instead of talking to each other as if they were the authorities, the world would be fewer headaches and more towels folded with the edge facing the same direction. Hasan whispered to the man that if he wanted his tomatoes to sell with pride, he should wait to be asked about color and sweetness instead of announcing them; the man pretended to take offense and then sold three kilos in five minutes to women who wanted to reward him for the effort.\n\nThat evening at the fountain, a stranger bent and drank and then looked at the water with that wide-eyed confusion city people practice when they discover that real taste exists in places without menus. His hair was overconfident; his shoes were tired; he put his palm on the broad stone and closed his eyes like a man listening to a song he had not paid for. He was the kind of person who might be harmless if he could be taught to be grateful on time. Yasemin watched him with one eyebrow lifted into a position that promised he would not be allowed to tell her who she was, and he lowered his gaze as if to suggest he had manners in a drawer somewhere and would get them if necessary. He drank again and nodded to the fountain, a gesture of such unshowy politeness that she withheld her scolding and allowed him to be new here without being a nuisance. He did not stay. He walked away before anyone could ask the question everyone asks when new mouths show up in old places.\n\nAt the end of that week, when Friday came and the air dressed itself in a clean shirt and pretended it had not been pestering widows and molds, Hoca Celal found Leyla under the rope swing with the cedar throwing good shade like alms. He had laughter folded in his pocket and did not take it out. \u201cCome,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will teach the old book a new pace. Your Esmeray\u2014do not argue with me about possession; language is a goat\u2014wearies. She will write when the lodos leaves her kitchen. She should write. It will fret her into health. In the meantime, we can decide how to keep men from telling this tale like a bottle smashed and a miracle in which they provided the neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy letting them feel some of the work,\u201d she said, standing with the reluctance of a person whose body had begun to insist on its rights and could not always be dismissed with a joke. \u201cWe will ask them to hang braids. We will ask them to comb air without getting drunk on it. We will ask them to wash the comb. We will ask them to hold the mint.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your mother will ask you to scrub the pans properly and not put anything sticky where ants could take it for an invitation to the conquest of the kitchen,\u201d he added with relish, because teasing Zeynep when she was not present was safer and sometimes necessary to remind himself he could still do delight without turning pious.\n\nThey walked to the well because all walking there now and then had the decency to pass by that center, as if the village had been given a new spine and was learning how to carry itself. The braid had collected dust and the oily touch of fingers, not as dirt, but as a record of who had believed in it with hands. Leyla smoothed it and it smoothed her. She took out the notebook R\u0131za had given her and wrote the names of those who had shown up unasked this week\u2014the boy with the knot he had failed to tie and proudly presented; the woman with the pigeon feather stuck in her hair who had not bothered to remove it because it did not disgrace her; the man who carried two water jugs for his neighbor because his back had not yet learned betrayal and he thought showing off might encourage it to stay loyal. She wrote them not as labels, but as words that would later be prayers whether or not anyone agreed to a mosque or a kitchen for their uttering.\n\nOn the fifth morning, the wind woke the village like a mother who has already brewed tea and will not fight to get people out of bed. It hummed through the braid and made a sound like a woman threading a needle and finding the hole obliges her without her having to squint too tight. In Istanbul a woman with leaves for drapes stood and did not tidy anything and did not demand perfection and did not hate herself for one long minute. On the Galata steps, the woman who spat offered the wind her gratitude again, and this time, uncharacteristically, she did not spit, because sometimes you move the offering from your mouth to your chest and the gods do not mind the change. In Konya, R\u0131za laughed into an empty room and did not tell anyone why because the day already had enough work.\n\nBy noon clouds gathered along the edge of the plateau with that ridiculous pomp with which they like to announce flourishes in a land that has planed itself kindly to make movement easier for goats and women carrying water. Dust thought about performing. Men looked up as if to say, go ahead then, do your worst, and dust, humiliated by the casual invitation, decided to take its tantrum elsewhere. The braid over the well shivered once the way a child shivers when its parents speak suddenly of bed, then settled, as if being a threshold had become an achieved habit. Leyla\u2019s palm burned suddenly, not in warning, but in recognition; the ring in her pocket had heated with a decisiveness that made her mouth water as if she had put a coin under her tongue. She took it out and held it flat in her hand. The carnelian\u2019s crack was merely stone and also a very thin path that light never forgot to take. The letters inside, which would not hold still long enough to be owned, rolled and then rolled back like sea and set their backs against the red as if saying, not yet.\n\nShe did not put the ring on. She pressed it to the stone lip of the well, not to return it, not to claim it, to let the circle greet another circle and see if they admired each other without malice. The well did not reply with drama. It acknowledged with a coolness that said, I am older than all your grandmothers. Move or do not move. Pray or do not pray. But behave. She lifted the ring and slipped it into her pocket with the ordinary motion of a housewife returning change to the purse deep inside the cupboard so no one could find it until she wanted them to.\n\nIn the evening, under a sky that was neither bruise nor boast, they made bread on the flat griddle, the kind that is meant to be rolled thinner than sorrow and thicker than rules. The wind behaved like a fan a girl in summer chooses to hold\u2014not because it cools, but because it gives the hand something to do while waiting for the fruit to sweeten. The neighbors came and pretended not to wait for an invitation; the men brought gossip and were thanked for it as if it were sugar; the children were made to sit and eat long after they insisted they were not hungry, and all of them managed to feel that they had gotten their way. Sabiha told a story about her sister\u2019s wedding that contradicted her own story from last year in two crucial places, and no one mentioned it because perhaps this version pleased the night better. When they had finished and the pans blinked in the low light and forgave themselves for having been dirty, Zeynep, who had worked all day to maintain civil relations among the elements, put her hands in her lap and allowed them to be seen like that, empty and heavy. \u201cWe will live,\u201d she said, as if annoyed to be forced into optimism by the facts. \u201cWe will live and I will scold you because you must wear a scarf when the wind behaves like a man who has come into a room he was not invited to.\u201d\n\nWhen the house slept, the well dreamed because it could, and the village slept because it trusted its own doors. The comb on the shelf learned contentment and did not ask to order the air while people dreamed; it had learned that to be useful at all hours is to be used up before spring. The braid barely moved and did not complain. The nazars faced outward and felt no need to blink ostentatiously. On the road past the gypsum cliffs a truck rumbled like an animal that misunderstands its own weight and thinks it gentle; the dust lifted three centimeters and then put itself back down, disabused of its romance for this particular dance. In \u00dcsk\u00fcdar the woman with leaves rolled out dough on a counter not entirely clean and did not die of it. In Konya, R\u0131za woke and laughed before coffee and insulted God with tenderness, which is prayer in a dialect no one wants to codify.\n\nThe next day, which belonged to no market and no saint, brought a boy to the well who had been born with a streak of panic where other children have a streak of boredom. He came, knees dusty, hair slicked with the hands of other boys who believed grooming should look like kindness, and stood on tiptoe and looked down as if expecting dragons or an aunt he had lost three years ago and still could not grieve because he had been too busy surviving. \u201cAblam,\u201d he asked without turning his head because children believe questions are owned by the air and not the person who answers them, \u201cif we drop our names into the water, do they drown.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you drop them like stones,\u201d Leyla said, kneeling so their eyes met and her voice did not have to climb, \u201cthey will sit on the bottom and sulk and frighten fish. If you lay them down like bread on a table and say \u2018buyurun,\u2019 they will feed something. Do you have a name you wish to feed.\u201d\n\nHe frowned, chewing the idea, then shook his head with a maturity that had no business on that small neck. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want one ready for the day I forget.\u201d He put his hand on the braid and the braid remembered that hands had made it and, for the first time since it had been hung, it purred.\n\nBy late afternoon news came up the slope with a kind of civilized haste: a storm at the edge of the plain had torn a slope and worried four roofs and made Yasemin\u2019s uncle swear in inventive and unusable ways. The village squared itself as if for a photograph of dignity. Women pulled in carpets as if catching children by the hems. Men took down satellite dishes they would later pretend had never been important to them. The wind arrived and then failed to be a guest we despise. The braid caught the first eagerness and re-apportioned it to the corners. The comb hung on its peg and did not lunge because it had learned it was not a weapon and was relieved to retire from war. The well, old to the point of being uninterested in the performance of weather, held its cool and did not take another fish hostage or spit out old rings to distract the village from its chores.\n\nNight\u2019s first hour rarely tells the truth about the day. It lies and says all has been well, or it performs for the window that thinks it was necessary. This night told the truth. It set itself down, a little crooked, and let itself be corrected by the yawns of people who would not be bullied into staying awake. Leyla sat with the notebook and finally wrote a line worth showing to someone who cannot be trusted to leave well enough alone. She hoped Hoca would read it and nod and then pretend to disagree; she hoped R\u0131za would read it and drink water and say \u201cHah,\u201d in a way that made the line taller. She wrote the names of the stones they had kept and the weight she had given away at the water and the bird who had thanked her by pecking its man and making him laugh like coin dropped into a plate at a wedding. She did not write Esmeray. She kept that name between her teeth where a woman keeps too much and therefore survives.\n\nThe following day the road from the city sent them a woman with a scarf tied in a way that came from the Black Sea like a piece of music, and she set a heavy bag down by Hasan\u2019s stall and said she was looking for the witch who had combed the well into good behavior because she had a son who loved fish only when they were alive and a husband who loved fish only when they were not and a house that had stopped cooking because the difference exhausted it. Hasan sent her to Zeynep because Zeynep had never been afraid of being the registrar for other people\u2019s foolishness even when she pretended she would not fill out the forms. \u201cSit,\u201d Zeynep told the woman, pouring tea as if tea were an apology that always arrived on time in this house, and then looked up at her daughter with a face that suggested she did not mind that the story had gotten out of their yard and into people\u2019s mouths. \u201cWash your hands,\u201d she added, because the day was not allowed to forget its dignity.\n\nThey kept the braid. They combed the fountain now and then, not to boss it, to remind it. They asked the nazars to face outward and to accept the duty with the kind of gravity reserved for old men and certain kinds of bread. They made small doorways in places where draft and complaint had been wrestling for years and told draft and complaint to behave themselves and consider marriage. They roped nothing and tied no one, and when men accused them of having banned something, they nodded and said \u201cEvet,\u201d with the bored audacity of women who have more important work than keeping score. The goats continued to escape their pegs and find the exact produce that had been counted and priced to the last coin and make pranks out of their mouths, and they were forgiven and scolded and forgiven again because stubbornness is a resource to be hoarded and spent carefully.\n\nOne late afternoon, when the sound of the call caught a flock in flight and made them rethink the route they had claimed, a letter arrived, not by pigeon, not by post, by a woman\u2019s breath. It came into the kitchen while the onions were being coaxed into honorable humility. It curled itself around the notch above Leyla\u2019s sternum and sat there until she stopped pretending to be busy and listened. It said nothing useful\u2014no instructions, no map, no appointment\u2014but it carried the smell of ivy warmed by late sun and a new, shy, honest scent of paper that had seen ink and not burned. It said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d in a tone that lovers have used to save themselves and those they love from being ridiculous, and \u201cSoon,\u201d in the tone of women who will not permit \u201csoon\u201d to be a cudgel. She did not tell anyone at the table; she salted the onions, and the onions surrendered, and the kitchen agreed for the length of a recipe to hold its disparate griefs and satisfactions in one hand like herbs and not let them slip.\n\nOn Sunday Zeynep took the lemon out and cut it with that old exactness that had convinced everyone in this house they were safe. The light cut through the yellow and came out on the other side as if it had done this before. She lifted the half and held it under her daughter\u2019s nose and said, \u201cBak. This is what comes of staying alive,\u201d and Leyla laughed because sometimes a mother picks a fruit and hands it to you like a diploma, and you accept because to refuse would be an offense against something older than any story anyone here will ever dare to write down and hide under a pillow. They ate with dirty fingers. They did not wait for anything to be approved by the city. They let the wind come in. They did not apologize when it complimented the curtains and then went out again to see if anyone needed combing.",
