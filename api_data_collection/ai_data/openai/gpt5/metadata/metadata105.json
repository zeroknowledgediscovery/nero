     "novel_text": "In the morning Winnipeg light, pale and thin as skim milk, Nate Kowalsky rolled the van door shut with a hinge-creak that could be heard halfway down the block. The block was gray and still. Snow didn\u2019t fall so much as just refuse to melt, crudded up into dense berms and glazed spots, the gravel naked in patches where tires had chewed and chewed. He rubbed his gloved hands together, the leather stiff, cords and wire spools bumping his hip through the canvas of his work pants. His breath came out in little comic balloons. If he smiled he could turn them into speech bubbles in his imagination.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he called, more to prove he had a voice than to greet anyone in particular. But there was Mrs. Banerjee across the way, kneeling in her parka, coaxing the world\u2019s bravest little dog over a ridge of tire-packed snow. She lifted a glove, triumphant. The dog lifted a tiny paw and looked offended by the very idea of February.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be late,\u201d she said, as if this were a moral failing, the kind that a city would remember. \u201cThe roads.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the van is for,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got opinions about black ice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has bad opinions,\u201d Mrs. Banerjee said, and the dog sneezed, which seemed like civic confirmation.\n\nHe slid into the driver\u2019s seat, swung his Thermos into the cup holder, and exhaled the tightness that work mornings gave him. His chest felt like a cupboard crammed with extension cords. He turned the key and treated the engine to murmured encouragements reserved for old friends and sullen children. It caught. The radio came on to a weather report that might\u2019ve been a joke, except the people on the radio never sounded like they were joking. He turned it down. He wanted to hear the van; it had a way of confiding in him about its health.\n\nThe first job of the day was in Wolseley, a century-old house with corners that sagged like surrendered shoulders and baseboards that had seen boot heels, paws, and probably the patience of saints. The homeowner was a young couple with a baby that had a constitution like a French horn. They were converting an attic into a nursery as if proximity to the sky itself were a tonic. He had told them, kindly, that if they didn\u2019t insulate that place like a Thermos bottle they\u2019d be raising a Canadian snowman. They laughed and nodded, and he\u2019d known then that he\u2019d be back in six months to fix what cold air had taught them.\n\nHe parked under an elm coarse with frost crystals and hauled his tool bag out by the handles. There was coffee in the bag too\u2014Gertie\u2019s coffee from the Blue Goose Diner\u2014evidence of the detour he\u2019d made, not because he needed caffeine (he did) but because he\u2019d gone for pie. It wasn\u2019t rational, going for pie at 7 a.m., but rationality had never been the boss of cravings. From the Blue Goose he\u2019d emerged with a paper box warm enough to fog his glasses, cradling what Gertie called \u201cbreakfast pie,\u201d which was the same as all the other pies but with spunk. Apple and cheddar braided into a crust he\u2019d sworn once he\u2019d heard sing. He told people he ate pie for his health and for economy (calories per dollar, Gertie, I\u2019m doing the math) and sometimes they believed him.\n\n\u201cCome in quick, quick,\u201d called a voice when he knocked at the Wolseley door. He stamped his boots and did not come in quick; years of polite habit rounded off into muscle memory. He stepped into a carpet that felt like it had been poured. The baby honked. The couple looked like people who\u2019d survived a long winter of requests.\n\n\u201cYou want me to\u2014\u201d he gestured at the attic hatch, simple and sacrificial.\n\n\u201cIf you could just see where the lamp wires go,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThey\u2019re acting like a tiny haunted house up there.\u201d\n\nThe man added, like a pledge, \u201cWe turned everything off in the panel you told us to. Promise.\u201d\n\nHauntings, in his profession, were either rodents or bad splices. He pulled down the wooden ladder that had the slick of many hands on its rails, and climbed with the calm that came from knowing wood had been trusted by bigger, heavier men than him. The attic smell hit him\u2014dry and sweet, the brittle blueprint smell of old joists and sawdust and the ghost of wool blankets. Light coming through a dormer smeared itself across dust-motes and made even the insulation seem like it might be helpful. He set the lamp down, unscrewed it, and followed the wire as if following a river upstream to its foolish headwaters.\n\nHe worked without drama. There is nothing like the rhythm of solving small problems with your hands to keep grandiose thoughts at bay. Strip, twist, cap. Tug, tuck, secure. When the couple came up to see, he explained in simple terms and they nodded like people who were grateful their time was being given back to them.\n\n\u201cIt will buzz when the furnace kicks because of the old ductwork,\u201d he told them. \u201cBuzzing is a love language in houses like these.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t tell them the things he sometimes thought while he worked, about how inside of every wall was an improvisational theater piece starring nails and temptation. He went back to the van when he was done, scratched a note for his afternoon job in Transcona where the gentleman had a hobby of putting in his own outlets sidewise for reasons that amounted to how \u201che liked it better.\u201d\n\nAt the Blue Goose, earlier, Gertie had looked at him over the pie case like a judge that everyone rooted for despite themselves. Her hair was a snowy cloud arrangeable into no fewer than three landscapes; her wrists were wrapped in bracelets the color of grape jelly.\n\n\u201cYou missed the prelims, Nate,\u201d she had said, sliding the paper box toward him ceremoniously. \u201cI would scold you but I don\u2019t scold electrician-hands. Those hands\u2014see? Those hands keep my pastry case lit and the mixer that hates me alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a breaker box older than me with more secrets than me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt whispered. I listened. We hugged. It was fine.\u201d\n\nGertie had a way of asking questions without words. Her eyebrows had a vocabulary.\n\n\u201cYou could have been somebody,\u201d she said, theatrically tragic. \u201cYou know the Spring Thaw pie-off goes to regionals, and regionals sends one glorious local into the arms of the National Sweet. That\u2019s what they call it now. The National Sweet! Can you imagine?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can imagine sugar,\u201d he had said, because his role at the Blue Goose was sarcasm and awe, colour-coded to Gertie\u2019s approval. Then he\u2019d let it land, what she had said. A second behind his smile, you could always see him thinking. \u201cWait. I missed the prelims?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not,\u201d she said, relenting, the eyebrows smoothing into forgiveness. \u201cBut I like you better when you leap. It\u2019s this afternoon, three o\u2019clock, down at The Forks. They do it outdoors because they claim fresh air is character-building. As if sugar ever failed to build character.\u201d\n\nHe had looked at the calendar on his phone and at the words he had scribbled in his workbook and felt something tug inside his ribs. He told himself it was just hunger switching masks.\n\nHe\u2019d always liked watching competitions that made a show out of ordinary pleasures. You didn\u2019t need the aesthetics of athleticism to admire someone standing before an open question: how much, how fast, how joyous? Pie was the opposite of sleek. It slumped. It refused to be a quick story, held together by starch and stubbornness. Gertie made pies that refused to be shamed into neatness. They did not slice well and it felt like a personality trait.\n\nAt noon the light brightened in that winter way that only emphasizes how sun here is like cold fire, a flame you are not allowed to get too close to. He hit the job in Transcona as if he were tackling a cousin, and made quick work of reorienting outlets to appease both electrical code and a man\u2019s love of symmetry\u2019s distant cousin, preference. There was something gentle about restoring a thing to code, a tiny social contract, like reminding someone to call their mother. He collected his cheque, paper, folded twice, his name spelled right, a small perfection.\n\nOn the drive to The Forks he took his glove off at a long light just to press his fingers against the heating vent. The radio told him a story about a man who had lost a canoe in summer and found it in winter in someone else\u2019s yard. In Winnipeg, carbon-steel notions like ownership had a way of getting buffed by weather into the more interesting concept of neighbor.\n\nAt The Forks the river paths looked like poorly kept promises, shinier than you wanted them to be. He followed the signs for the festival, smack into stands selling Ukrainian flags and butter tarts and antler headbands because at some point while he lived ordinarily, someone had decided that antlers were now a noun you could wear for ironic clout. Winnipeg collects irony like an aunt collects teaspoons. You look at the city and think: surely there cannot be more. And then there is.\n\nA crowd had already gathered under the string lights that day refused to overpower. Nate recognized the official in charge\u2014Drew, who was an unofficial battery of every mid-level festival in the city, possessed of clipboard, beard, and a voice that could fling syllables into a crowd.\n\n\u201cLast call for hungry fools,\u201d Drew bellowed, smiling wide. \u201cGet your bibs. Bowl of water to the left, napkins to the right, dignity in a locker somewhere far away.\u201d\n\nGertie shouted when she saw him, such that strangers parted like a curtain. \u201cHe made it,\u201d she declared to no one and everyone. \u201cI am responsible for this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Nate said, but he was the one to step into the ring of tables like a man who had just remembered something that mattered to him. He had eaten pie competitively once in high school, in a gym that smelled like varnish and teenage effort. He\u2019d been shirtsleeves and bravery then. Now he was work jacket and longing.\n\nThe rules were simple. The pies were Saskatoon berry, blue as the bruises you\u2019d be bragging about later. No hands, forkless, face-first. You had eight minutes to do with your mouth what your hands would do better, and in this there was a lesson.\n\nHe found a place at the far end and tied the ridiculous plastic bib around his neck. A woman to his left, short and sharp-eyed, nodded at him like a colleague at a conference. To his right a boy in a toque too large looked both terrified and giddy.\n\n\u201cFirst time?\u201d Nate asked the boy.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the boy said, and then turned red. \u201cYes. I mean, I watch videos online.\u201d\n\n\u201cVideos never smelled like this,\u201d the woman said, and she was right. The air was thick with sugar and fruit and that bakery scent that was equal parts comfort and warning.\n\nWhen Drew blew the whistle it felt like someone had opened the starting gate on tiny, sweet horses. Nate bent and let himself go. In the first seconds there is always panic\u2014food, in this quantity, is a topographical feature. It isn\u2019t for tasting; it\u2019s for understanding. He understood Gertie\u2019s crust. He found the rhythm, like a man sanding a door in long, even strokes, and listened to his lungs. He knew when to breathe through his nose, shorties and then a long haul, when to let his tongue help, practical and relentless. He felt ridiculous, and then he stopped caring, which is the start of every good performance. He laughed at his own face, which must be a geographer\u2019s dream. For a brief minute, a minute that tasted like berries and regret, he was happy in the way that requires no permission.\n\nHe didn\u2019t win. The woman at his left had a technique that made his seem pastoral. She had some secret, possibly to do with how she enforced a mental calorie truce. The boy on his right flamed out quickly and sat back, daubing his cheeks with a napkin like an old man at a sink. Nate finished his pie, finished it entirely, which he set out to do as if closing a loop for a version of himself who wasn\u2019t allowed to waste, ever, as a child. That had been his mother\u2019s voice, the knuckles of it all sincerity and hard work. He lifted his head, laughing, aware of the purple streak he must now carry like a flag.\n\n\u201cFinalist positions will be posted this evening,\u201d Drew announced, after it all, when the contestants stood looking at themselves, the way you do when you\u2019ve done something both silly and sincere. \u201cIt\u2019s based on both speed and degree of clean. We are professionals.\u201d\n\nGertie had edged her way to the table with a stack of napkins anyway. Her bracelets clinked like tiny bells. \u201cYou,\u201d she said, meaning him entirely, \u201cwere a painting. You were art.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was blueberry slaughter,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the life you choose,\u201d she said, not unkindly, wiping a dot of juice from his ear as if she were his auntie and not the town\u2019s loudest oracle.\n\nHe went home in the dusk, of which there was plenty. Mrs. Banerjee\u2019s dog barked once, like an affidavit, and he waved. In his kitchen, he leaned against the counter and drank water like someone who had been out in the desert and found a public fountain. He took off his boots. The radio, later, said that a person was recommended to do a thing because the heart is better off at rooms where there are stories rather than at doors where there are none.\n\nHe checked his phone at 8 p.m., when Drew was likely to have collated the results, armed with a spreadsheet and a beer. His name was, to his surprise, third. Third is such a sweet spot. First is the target; second is okay if you hate bragging; third is an astonishment and therefore pure joy. The top three, the website said in letters that had clearly been decided upon during a committee that believed in excitement by font, would travel to Toronto for the National Sweet.\n\nHe read the line twice. The word travel glowed. He had been to Thunder Bay once as a kid, an adventure that had felt like an ocean voyage. He had flown to Vancouver exactly one time for a cousin\u2019s wedding, wearing a suit that had made him feel like a carefully constructed argument. He liked where he lived not because he couldn\u2019t imagine anywhere else but because he could and chose this anyway. But trains. Trains were a story he had told himself many times while driving, the winter\u2019s glittering track insistently parallel to the highway for a stretch out by Transcona, all that metal, those plans. He had always wanted to take the train east like a person who wanted to step into a history that did not include him. Like being allowed to hold somebody else\u2019s heirloom careful: look, don\u2019t break it.\n\nHe set the phone down and picked it up again. He texted someone and erased it. He walked around the table the way some people circle new cars, considering. He called his mother.\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d he said when she answered, the old house in St. Boniface singing its own high note on the line, as if the phone wires remembered voices in the tone of a minor key.\n\n\u201cNathan,\u201d she said, same as always, the Ukrainian in her voice like embroidery on a plain shirt. \u201cYour Uncle tells me you fixed his shaver.\u201d\n\n\u201cUncle Brodie fixed his shaver,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI told him not to shave when he\u2019s drowsy. I have news.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do not tell me you are engaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would that be something you do not wish?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I would then need to cook what your grandmother cooked, and my hands are not as young as my mouth.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. He could see her at the blinds, peeking, the street, her life reduced to a few square panes and a television that tried its best.\n\n\u201cI made a pie eating thing,\u201d he said. \u201cA contest. Do not make the sign of the cross, this is an honest story. I placed. I have to go to the big thing if I can, in Toronto.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you are calling me because I am from Ontario and therefore am responsible for trains,\u201d his mother said, sharp, amused. She had been seventeen when she left her Ontario town for the Prairies, with a suitcase that had been heavy not because of what was in it but because of what she thought she was leaving behind. She still said sorry in a way that made apologies sound like pastries\u2014unexpected, sugar-dusted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling you because I wanted to say it out loud,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought you might say something.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have said many things,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout hydration, about the sins of sugar. I will say the train from Winnipeg to Toronto is expensive like a fur coat and twice as warm if you choose to sit near the window. Your cousin went that way and did not stop talking about the way Jacques said the word \u2018dome\u2019 for days after he met that man from Quebec. People on the train tell you their life because they cannot get off and you cannot get off and in this way intimacy is inflicted. How much is the ticket.\u201d\n\nHe clicked and tapped. The website for Via Rail did that polite thing of pretending it had lots of options and then slowly declining most of them. He read the categories aloud. Economy. Upper. Sleeper. His mother hummed at the dollar amounts like a person unsure whether to take thirds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot,\u201d he said finally. \u201cAnd this is assuming I go without a bed and just\u2026arrange my body. Which it does not love.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cThe world charges for dreams like it charges for novelty t-shirts. For the printing and for the idea. You have money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have enough money for my new tires and for uncle\u2019s shaver and for a couch that doesn\u2019t slump in the middle, not theatrical dreams,\u201d he said. He said it lightly but he knew the numbers. He had a mind like a tidy junk drawer where, if you moved the elastic bands and twist-ties, there were facts too.\n\n\u201cMaybe they pay you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey pay you in applause and a commemorative bib.\u201d\n\n\u201cA family heirloom,\u201d she said, and he heard her smile. \u201cI will pray\u2014it\u2019s what I do\u2014for a sponsor. The world is full of people who love to give their name to other people\u2019s pie. And if not, then you will go another time. You will be sad, and then you will not be sad, and you will be happy in a way that isn\u2019t about the going.\u201d\n\nShe was like that. She had a way of pulling the thread of a thing until the knot said fine, fine, you\u2019re right. He didn\u2019t want to skip the sadness, though. He wanted to stand in both the wanting and the reality like a person who can hold two plates without dropping either and also acknowledge that he is not a juggler. He told her he loved her. She told him to wear his hat in that wind that came across the field like a rumor that had turned into a fist.\n\nAfter he hung up he sat silently. The fridge hummed. Somewhere below him someone sneezed; the building echoed it back politely. He had no spare money lodged anywhere obvious. Work had been steady but not extravagant, his habit of putting cash aside consistent and not miraculous. He had never learned the magic some people knew: summoning big money at a moment\u2019s notice. Bingo luck. Uncle money, lottery, mysterious envelope. The only thing he knew how to do was more of what he already did, and time was a pie you couldn\u2019t cut more of.\n\nHe came awake the next morning planning to not think about it, then thinking about it anyway, because the mind is a dog let out into the yard and it always goes to the same spot first. He had a job in a caf\u00e9 off Corydon where the owner wanted more black track lighting even though the ceiling was low enough to gossip with. He hauled the ladder in, nodded to the barista who looked like a photograph of a barista, and made a world of small black fixtures align like planets in a tiny galaxy. People sat under the future lights and ate scones, and their hair caught even the minimal morning light like it was a secret they\u2019d been hoping to keep. He thought about asking the caf\u00e9 woman if she would sponsor a sweet-toothed electrician and get her name on a bib. He did not ask. There is a fine line between audacity and theft, and he did not yet have the boots for it.\n\nAt lunch he parked by the river and climbed onto the little footbridge to watch the brown water move under its shell of ice. Winnipeg has two rivers and they move like a dispute, slowly, in public. The breeze cut his eyes. A skate-bladed couple glided past holding hands like a metaphor that refused to stay where it belonged. He took a picture of the sky because it was one of those days when it looked like it had been ironed by someone conscientious. He sent the picture to his friend Raj with the caption: people are moving on purpose.\n\nRaj sent back a series of dumpling emojis and then: drew told me u\u2019re in. what\u2019s the plan.\n\nHe typed: i halved the plan with the universe and it kept the half with the dollars. he added a shrug, and then felt childish, and then sent it anyway.\n\nThere was work to do: a panel to upgrade in a new-old house in St. James where a guy named Brad who had really wanted to be named Bradley insisted that the panel be flush with the wall because he hated \u201cbumpy things.\u201d Nate said it could be done but would be ugly; Brad hesitated at the ugly, and then made the right call, the good choice that men who want to be named something else often have hidden inside them. Nate unspooled cable like a fisherman and felt the tautness in his shoulders that sometimes made him think he was a part of the structure he was working on. He was in it; he might as well be in it.\n\nEvery spare moment, in the van, in line at the hardware store where he knew the price of outlets and the names of the people who bought them in bulk, he did math. Train fare. Food. A cheap place to sleep. He opened tabs that he then shut because looking at them hurt. The festival was a week away. There were emails now from the organizers with words like \u201cdelighted\u201d in them, words that were, against all logic, persuasive. There were small print details. He read them like a good boy. No assistance. No outside sponsorship unless approved. Waiver. The word waiver is never used for anything you would truly want to do; it\u2019s involved when someone somewhere thinks there\u2019s going to be fun and therefore probably risk. There was a line about \u201ctravel is the responsibility of the contestant.\u201d He marked it yellow, for emphasis he didn\u2019t need.\n\nAt the Blue Goose that week, Gertie made special pie with a heart cut in the top. She offered him a slice for free and he paid anyway. He told her about the trains.\n\n\u201cAh, the train,\u201d she said. \u201cI once took a train to Montreal and we shared a table with a man who had never learned to say the word \u2018oats\u2019 without sounding like he was confessing something. I had a bunk. I pretended that my bunk was a private cabin and my cabin was a small country. Every women deserves a tiny country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take a seat,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d make it a country anyway.\u201d\n\nShe considered. \u201cDo you have a girl,\u201d she said, and he laughed at how sudden she was.\n\n\u201cI have a mother and a van,\u201d he said, \u201cand a neighbor who scolds. Does that count.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have hands that can hold a wire without fear,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will not always be alone.\u201d It wasn\u2019t pity; it was prophecy, fixed with a fork.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t fear wire,\u201d he said. \u201cI fear invoices.\u201d\n\nIt took three more days for it to land in a way that felt like truth\u2014the no of the train. There wasn\u2019t a dramatic moment, no last-minute phone call, no denial of a loan or a cruel card decline at a gas pump. There was simply, on a Thursday evening, a mirror and his face in it, and he said out loud, \u201cI\u2019ll not go,\u201d and the face didn\u2019t flinch. He felt the no settle into the kitchen like a guest who understands how to keep his elbows in. He wrote the email to Drew, the man of clipboards, and chose words that weren\u2019t a scream even though his chest wanted one. He said: I\u2019m unable to make it to Toronto. Select someone who can. Congratulations to the others.\n\nThe send button was a small red thing. He pressed it as if he were a man turning off a light in an empty room. Then he went out, because the house seemed intent on telling him things he did not want to hear too loudly. He walked and let his boots mind their own business on the packed and glittering ruts. A kid down the block had built a snow fort and made a sign for it in marker on a pizza box. It read: no dogs and no adults who hate forts. He wanted to stand at the entrance and recite his credentials. He qualified, technically.\n\nHe found himself at The Forks again, in that way that you do when your feet know places they want to wander when your mind is busy. It was later, near close, the vendors beginning their slow and practiced rituals of tidying away. He walked past the ice sculptures where angles had been made to pretend they were delicate not for long. He sat on a bench and felt the cold come through it and into his bones, where he could breathe it out slowly. He might have stayed there until his anger turned into something else. Or he might have stood up and smashed the pie-stand cardboard cutout of a smiling berry with his boot. He did neither. He looked at his phone for no reason and then remembered that his hands were cold and put it away.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d It was a voice that had always felt like a tap on the shoulder\u2014a little too much familiarity for the first moment. It was Raj, who had a way of being anywhere that felt like both a trick and a kindness.\n\n\u201cI told you I would regret it,\u201d Raj said, sitting beside him, using the plural you of best friends. \u201cBut I also told you I would not try to change your mind. Possibly I lied about that second part.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot be the guy who crowdfunds pie,\u201d Nate said. \u201cI mean. That sentence? That is a sentence that cannot be lived down in a city of this size.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to crowdfund,\u201d Raj said. \u201cYou need a patron. Sponsors. Someone who makes flour. Someone who makes forks.\u201d His mind was a market. He pressed his gloved hands to his knees and bounced his heels and then stopped, aware of the reading now in Nate\u2019s posture\u2014no bouncing.\n\n\u201cGertie,\u201d Raj said, because solutions have to be at least proposed. \u201cShe loves you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe loves dramatic speeches,\u201d Nate said. \u201cI am a man made of minor chords.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen a minor-chord man lets his friends set banners behind him while he continues to play minor chords until someone cries,\u201d Raj said. \u201cI know, yes, pride. I am messy. You are tidy. Let me make a case.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like we don\u2019t become who we are because of the kitchens we grew in,\u201d Nate said. \u201cMy mother taught me to take instead a smaller piece and to be grateful. Your mother taught you to reach bravely and apologize later with cookies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cookies were excellent,\u201d Raj said. \u201cThey solved crimes. They solved wars. Eat one and forgive me for wanting you to go to the thing you want to go to.\u201d\n\nNate breathed. It steamed. He thought about how the city looks from the train window: the yards and siding, the backs of houses, the undershirts of neighborhoods. He thought about how his life, small and neatly arrayed like a toolbox he liked to open and look at sometimes just to feel he was the kind of person who liked order, might make room for something sloppy.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and his own okay startled him. But he\u2019d only said okay to listening.\n\nRaj didn\u2019t crow. He relaxed his shoulders. \u201cThere are ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are rooms with people who want to put their big names on small brave things.\u201d\n\nHe did not say: my uncle knows a guy, because this was not that kind of favor. Instead he took out his phone and showed Nate a message he\u2019d already written to their friend Flor in communications with the community arts council. It was beautifully worded, a way to ask without it sounding like begging. It was not an ask, even, so much as an offering: a chance to be associated with a good story. Nate read it and something in him did not object.\n\nThe next day he went back to work in a small office in an old bank building, the vault now a copy room, the thrill of walking inside of it still new enough to be the good kind of childish. He cut conduit to length. He measured twice. Measured again. He let the day keep him honest. His phone buzzed late afternoon with a message from Drew anyway: sorry to hear it. if anything changes, the spot is yours.\n\nHe typed and erased three responses. He finally sent: thanks. if something changes you\u2019ll be the first to know besides my mother.\n\nHe went to the Blue Goose afterward without knowing he was going there until he was there, his boots already at the mat. Gertie pointed at him with a knife, then realized what she was doing, and made it into theater, which is to say she flourished. \u201cHero,\u201d she said, like a threat. He could see she\u2019d heard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a tragedy,\u201d he said quickly. He didn\u2019t want to see it reflected back at him that way. He had a dislike of melodrama unless it was clearly labeled. \u201cIt\u2019s an ordinary no.\u201d\n\nShe reached for a paper plate, set it on the counter. She did not put pie on it because she was not an insult comic. \u201cSome ordinary nos hold up the world,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are ninety-eight you\u2019ll speak with fondness of the day you didn\u2019t go to Toronto because of stubbornness and money.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t know whether she was gently scolding or gently teasing so he gave her the sincerity he had. \u201cI wanted to go,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I wanted to say it. Out loud. To someone who\u2019d hold it steady and not turn it into a lesson or sad song. To just say it, and let it be real and not be the end of anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a pie for that,\u201d she said. \u201cI put thyme and lemon in it for people who insist on complicated feelings.\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cYou making that up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the back,\u201d she said, and then went to the back because sometimes a person tells you where they\u2019re going because the idea of surprise is not kind.\n\nHe sat on the stool at the end of the counter where he had sat many times and looked out at his city through the glass, where the shapes of people in coats are mostly identical and the only way you know someone is by how they move. Winnipeg had a way of making you small and then rewarding your faithfulness if you stayed small. He loved it. He resented it a little. He loved it again. When Gertie came back with pie that smelled like a garden had agreed to have tea, he felt the little sigh his heart made when a thing was right.\n\n\u201cEat your complicated feelings,\u201d she said. \u201cThen come to the back because a man from the Winnipeg Agricultural Society is paying me for pie and this may be a coincidence or an omen.\u201d\n\nHe forked thyme and understood, in that moment, that happy was not a place he would arrive at with flags. It was something to be located inside a day like this: heavy boots, a ladder, a laugh at the right time, a no that you can say and survive, a pie with thyme in it just because someone thought you might need to chew on the idea.\n\nThe man from the society wore a suit of the sort that makes a person look as if he has somewhere else to be and the decency to pretend he does not. He had a grin like a row of dominoes, straight, ready to run. He loved Gertie because all the sensible people did.\n\n\u201cI heard about your boy,\u201d he said to her, indicating Nate with a skim of his chin. \u201cNot all our heroes are hockey.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Gertie said. \u201cSome of us are pastry.\u201d\n\nThe man grinned. \u201cWe have some community funds for travel for silly reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I will not pretend we\u2019re building a hospital. But we fund the quilt-makers and the square dancers and the man who makes tiny ships in bottles and then breaks the bottles on purpose in a performance art thing I frankly do not understand. We make room for joy. We\u2019d like to help him go to Toronto. I called the council. They told me they\u2019d already heard from a Raj. We all apparently want to be part of this.\u201d\n\nThe thrill that rose in Nate had to be tamed; he had practice. He folded his hands, imagined he was talking to wire. He said the thing he believed he should. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d and then paused, because he could hear what he was about to do to his own luck, the thing pride sometimes does that is just self-sabotage with polish. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be obliged,\u201d he said instead, truth but not ruinous. \u201cI would want to be wearing the name of the thing that helps me and not making a fuss about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll let us put a wheat sheaf on your bib,\u201d the man said, like an oath, and stuck out his hand and then pulled it back because nobody shakes hands anymore and also his hand was sticky. He wiped it on a napkin and then extended it again. Real handshake this time, warm palm, sincere grip.\n\nNate laughed, too loudly in his own hearing, the way you do when something relieves tension you were pretending you did not have. He looked at Gertie, who nodded at him like a general. He took the man\u2019s hand and a little bit of what he had wanted settled into him, quick and lovely as a spoon. He said, \u201cOkay. Okay.\u201d\n\nThe man wrote a number on a piece of paper, a pledge like a neighborly handshake written down. It was not a number that solved everything, but it didn\u2019t have to be; it made the rest possible. He had some saved. He could do the rest. It meant, practically, a week of careful dinners, a fraying of comfort in the service of purpose. He understood that trade. He took the paper and folded it and imagined the train.\n\nThat night he lay in bed and let the train in his head go east. Past the yards. Past the backyard trampolines and laundry lines. Past the flat line of fields carved into snow and then through forest, true wild, where the sky lowers itself as if to eavesdrop. He could feel the motion of it. He whispered to himself like a man calming something. He said, so quiet, \u201cI get to go,\u201d and believed it.\n\nIn the morning, he went to the Via Rail site again and this time he did not close the tab. He found a fare that did not break him, and a seat that promised a window. He put in his card numbers the way he always did, resolute as screws. He clicked purchase and the little wheel spun and for a second the universe could have gone either way, because that is how computers perform suspense, and then it slowed, and stopped, and he had a ticket number.\n\nHe set the phone down and stared at the ceiling as if it were painted with a map only he could read. It felt\u2014of course it did\u2014like the opening of something large, even though he knew it might be only the opening of a very small thing that looked large today. It was good. Even if he did not win a thing besides a bib and his own giggle, it was good.\n\nHe went to work. It was easier to carry ladders when your heart is full. He pulled wires and fixed switches and in one living room talked softly to a timid cat who believed the ladder was an insult. Winnipeg did its Winnipeg thing and served him a day in a tone between steel and caramel. He ate soup out of a thermos because being careful doesn\u2019t have to taste like punishing yourself. He skipped the Blue Goose because he didn\u2019t want to make the day too neat. He saved it for tomorrow. He saved\u2014the habit of this was a muscle. It made other kinds of saving feel possible.\n\nOn the last night before he left he went to his mother\u2019s to drop off a spare key because she liked to check his plants and eat his yogurt and pretend she was only checking whether his stove was on. She made him borscht as if he were leaving for sea and could never find beets again. He told her the plan and she nodded as if trains were old friends she had always expected to see reappear at this very moment, on her doorstep, with pie.\n\n\u201cWhen you look out the window,\u201d she said, wiping her hands on a dish towel that had been a better dish towel long ago, \u201cyou will think you are seeing a movie. Twice you will see a moose and think you imagined it. Once you will see a fox. You will pass through the dark and wake in the dark and your body will say what is this. You will listen to someone tell you the whole of their life and you will be a good man and not be bored. You will be smaller when you get there because you left yourself behind, part of you, and it will catch up.\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve done this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have stayed awake at night while waiting for trains to arrive that were late and told myself stories about people on them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the same.\u201d\n\nHe hugged her. She smelled like onions and winter. She put two pairs of socks in his bag as if the modern world had forgotten to invent warm socks and mothers were still required. He let her. He would wear them and when his feet were warm he would think: I am a person with a mother.\n\nWhen he left, she stood at the window doing the thing that she always did, which was to pretend she wasn\u2019t thinking about saying something that she then said. She lifted the pane and leaned out a little, as if speaking to a child at a snowbank. \u201cNathan,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you win, you will forget at once the train ride. If you do not, you will remember. Either way, call me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will call you,\u201d he said, out loud, to the winter, to the person he had been when he had said no, to the person he was becoming now in the chill that said: pay attention. He put his hands in his pockets and walked along the shoveled sidewalk, grateful to the unknown neighbor who had done that good and beautiful thing before the city had to ask. The moon was out, scissored by bare branches. He thought: a life is like this, sharp, pale, sometimes needing to borrow light. He thought about pie and about trains and about wire and about hands that could hold all of it, gently, without dropping, for as long as necessary and then longer. He went home to sleep the way a well-wound clock must sleep\u2014by permission.He woke before his alarm and lay there in the innocent dark of a winter morning, his body aware of the appointment before his mind could line up its reasons. The radiator ticked like a polite insect. Somewhere in the building\u2019s lungs, water made a sound like it had to be somewhere else in a hurry. He reached for the phone and did the thing he had decided he would do last night when he had imagined, with the righteousness of a man about to be tested, that he would act like someone who didn\u2019t need reminding: he turned the alarm off before it could boss him. He made coffee with the same neatness he brought to panels, set out his Thermos, set out the two ham-and-mustard sandwiches he had wrapped in wax paper because foil felt like theater for a man on a train. He checked his bag in a sequence\u2014socks (mother: accounted for), ticket on the phone, spare portable charger, a sweater that felt like a hug with an opinion, two paperbacks because as much as he trusted modern batteries he trusted pages more. He put a small screwdriver in the outside pocket because you never know when you might be required to show the world that hinge pins and battery compartments have nothing to fear.\n\nHe stepped into the hall with the reverence reserved for a quiet that could be injured. The stairwell air had that institutional tang of floor cleaner and old snow. Outside, the curb looked like it had grown up with him, familiar and unbothered by his news. The van was a dark shape under a fine glaze, everyone\u2019s sugar, the street\u2019s confirmation. He scraped the windshield with the brisk efficiency of a man with a train to catch and a dislike of performative struggle. He didn\u2019t trust the van to be forgiving if he left it in long-term parking, and besides, Raj had already texted that he would drive him the last few blocks from his place because he liked the idea of being part of the procession of departure. He slid behind the wheel and listened to the engine\u2019s mile-long yawn and thought, not self-mockingly, that the sound of you leaving is sometimes the first applause.\n\nUnion Station in Winnipeg has the kind of bones that make you behave. Its stone makes you feel like you would be a better person if you lowered your voice. The long hall held a handful of figures\u2014people who knew the train schedule in their legs, people who had never taken a train before and were thinking very hard about how to make that obvious, people who had done this enough to look bored and were in danger of being mistaken for romantic. The bench seats had polished a shine into themselves with decades of waiting. Above it all, the ceiling looked like something that had once been painted with angels and then, in a fit of prairie pragmatism, sanded down to a dignified cream.\n\nHe stood with his bag at his feet and looked at the departure board because you have to look at something. PORTE 1 clung to the French like a refrain. TORONTO VIA THE LAKEHEAD looked like a story you could add pictures to. The announcement came in the two voices of the country, the second voice with the roundness his mother teased into the word sorry, and he found himself relaxing as if the bilingualism were a blanket. The track listing clicked a column over. A child somewhere dropped a toy and howled as if offended by gravity itself. A man with a guitar case had the broken proud look of someone who had decided a long time ago to keep doing a thing that loved him only most days. On the wall, the framed photographs of trains through seasons were arranged with the moral weight of saints.\n\nRaj appeared out of the winter like it was a curtain he was parting for effect. He had a paper bag that had the exaggerated grease blush of breakfast sandwiches too eager to be coy. \u201cOne is for me,\u201d he said, already chewing, \u201cand one is for you unless you have decided to live like a monk on this sacred morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have ham,\u201d Nate said, lifting the corner of his bag as if to show documents. \u201cBut I will not argue with egg.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should never argue with egg,\u201d Raj said, and put the bag into his hand and then did what good friends do when their jokes land in rooms that are serious: he stopped. He looked at Nate and said, low, not for drama but to get it into the ear in the true way, \u201cI am proud. I would be proud if you were going to a conference about screws. But I am especially proud because this is the kind of thing people will call silly and you did not let that word decide for you. Take pictures from the window. If you see a moose, I will accept a description that is mostly antlers.\u201d\n\nNate grinned in spite of the part of him that was busy recounting the order of cars in a train he could not see yet, like reciting a prayer to calm a stomach. \u201cI will text you if I see a fox,\u201d he said. \u201cThe moose can be saved for a poem.\u201d\n\nThey bumped shoulders because hugging felt like showing off in a building that had seen troops leave for wars and children leave for colleges and didn\u2019t need his little sentimentalities performed in the aisle. When they called boarding, he moved with the group down the long throat of the platform toward the snow-breathed beast that was the Canadian, its stainless sides dull in the pale light, windows winking like patient eyes. The conductor at the stairs had the kind face of a man who had been asked many questions about assigned seats and was still willing to answer them as if for the first time. \u201cCoach to the right,\u201d he said, in a rhythm that was geography and refrain. \u201cDome open later. Lake on your left if you\u2019re lucky.\u201d\n\nHe found his seat with the instinct of someone who has learned the algebra of personal space: not too near the bathroom, not under a vent that had opinions, not next to the man with shoes shedding mud like a confession. He slid his bag up and felt the relief of closeness and containment that envelopes sometimes give. Outside, the platform looked like a stage you had walked away from while the show continued behind you. A woman tapped on his window and he startled until he realized she hadn\u2019t tapped; his own brain had delivered an echo of every farewell movie ever made, the hand on glass, the train pulling away, someone running and someone no longer running.\n\nThe train\u2019s first lurch had the weight of decision. It carried them past the brick and stone of the station, past the winter-still Forks and the stutter of people on blades on the Red River skating trail, past the wefts of graffitied retaining walls where spray paint had turned teenage desire into geography, past yards with trampolines like winter crowns, past piles of snow like moats around small castles of practicality. Winnipeg spread its paleness beside them and then, without ceremony, dropped away into flat. He watched the city go with an attention he reserved for goodbyes he didn\u2019t intend to make a fuss over. He was not leaving for good; he would be home before his philodendron had time to register his absence. Still, the sensation was clear: there he went.\n\nIn the seat beside him an older woman unrolled a little wool blanket that had clearly been to more places than some people. She had the calm of a person who carried knitting without needing to take it out yet. On the aisle, a boy with a buzz cut scrolled on a phone and chewed gum with the passionate energy of someone who had not had coffee and yet possessed a metabolism like a series of trampolines. Across the way a man in a parka with reflective strips sat down and promptly fell asleep, his hands folded under his chin as if in prayer. The car had that sound trains have, a layered set of songs: the whir and clack, the occasional thunk of track realities, a soft hiss when the car sighed at a crossing as if exasperated with the way humans arrange roads with such confidence.\n\nHe took his sandwich out and ate it in polite bites because something about trains made you perform your manners for the floor. The mustard was perfect. He let his eyes be greedy. The prairie in winter can be accused of sameness by those who only look at the big shapes. He had learned differently. There were lines, tucked under lines, history lain down by wind and by hand, fences that stood anyway, crows like punctuation. The sun worked hard and advanced the light only a little, stubborn as a mason setting bricks in cold.\n\nBy Portage la Prairie a child had made her way past with a plastic horse whose mane had known the indignities of love. She fell into Nate\u2019s aisle with the abandon of people who consider gravity only an occasional suggestion. The horse\u2019s tail detached in protest. The child\u2019s face did that morphing thing all kids\u2019 faces do\u2014astonishment into betrayal into fury\u2014about a plastic tail. He was already bending with a hand out, because the reflex to hand a screwdriver to grief was deeply ingrained. He took the little tail in his palm, turned it, saw the tiny nub of a post that needed a patient twist, and reached into the pocket that had the tool he had packed precisely for this sort of thing he hadn\u2019t been able to name. He looked at the mother\u2014young, tired, eyes like someone who had read the night from start to finish without blinking\u2014and lifted his eyebrows with the question. She nodded, gratitude already queued up behind her reserves.\n\n\u201cIt was born without it,\u201d the child announced, already having decided the narrative.\n\n\u201cAll the best horses improvise,\u201d he said, and turned the post, gentle, slow, a half-spin and in. The tail sat back in the place designed for it as if this had always been a moment trees had been grown to become. He handed it back solemnly. The child took it with the seriousness kids reserve for people who don\u2019t tell them they\u2019re cute. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, as if reporting to a captain. She turned to go, remembered something, and returned to show him that the horse could indeed swish, a demonstration so proud and so brief it elevated the whole day by a centimeter.\n\nBy the time they reached the turn where the tracks begin their long conversation with lake and forest, people had established the habits that would carry them for the next many hours. The man with the reflective jacket snored politely. The boy with the gum had acquired a deck of cards and, lacking a partner, dealt solitaire in a way that made it look like he was practicing for a life of spectacular disagreements with fate. The blanket woman brought out her knitting and knit as if there were a level of peace available to those who counted stitches. A conductor came through with the check, the punch on the paper tickets making a snow of tiny circles on the carpet where they had been made a hundred thousand times before. He wore a name tag that read JACQUES in neat black letters, no extravagance, and the way he said dome to the woman across the aisle had that roundness his mother had mentioned, the vowel a longer joy than his tongue would have given it.\n\n\u201cYou can go up into the dome whenever you like,\u201d Jacques said, finding the line between instruction and invitation. \u201cIt is better when it is darker. You see everything and nothing and it is romantic if you are in the mood and spooky if you are not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am exactly in between,\u201d the woman said, and Jacques smiled in a way that said he had been in between and had lived to tell it.\n\nWhen Nate wandered forward later, the car with the curve of glass felt like entering a throat made of sky. The seats pointed upward and outward, an insistence, a gentle bossiness to look, really look. The winter was a flicker book. Trees pressed up to the tracks like those kids at aquariums who cannot help but stick their tongues to the glass to see if the ocean will taste of anything besides cleaner. Once, twice, three times, he thought he saw a fox unspool itself from shadow and race parallel a few yards before cutting away into certainty. People murmur in dome cars. It has the feeling of a church, of a place designed for awe where even the atheists keep their voices low because it seems rude to speak at full human volume in front of trees that have agreed to be beautiful for us even when we are busy.\n\nHe watched as low roofs of small towns slid past, the names on their water towers like nicknames you could make poems out of if you were that kind. He saw a snowmobile trail intersect the world like a private thought. He felt the train\u2019s power\u2014the part that isn\u2019t noise but a muscle working somewhere below your feet, a kind of giant calf raising and lowering itself in smooth mechanical repetitions\u2014and thought about how none of this happened because of magic and all of it looked like magic anyway. After a while, Jacques came up and sat on the little step at the top, the way conductors have a right to occupy any liminal space, and told a story to no one in particular because dome cars make storytellers generous.\n\n\u201cI was a boy when I first rode this and I got a nosebleed,\u201d he said, addressing the glass as if it owed him a response. \u201cMy mother did not have a tissue so she used the ticket. It looked like the trip itself had cost blood. When we got to Thunder Bay she cried in a way she did not think I could hear, and I thought, ah, the world is too big for my mother. Then she tied a scarf around her head and went into the station and came out holding a paper bag and she had bought doughnuts and I thought, no, my mother is too big for the world.\u201d\n\nNate listened and smiled into his sleeve because the story was entire and didn\u2019t need him to poke it. He let the day lay itself down. He went back to his seat when his stomach told him about time. He ate half of one ham-and-mustard sandwich and saved the rest because he averaged abundance as a policy. He texted his mother a picture of nothing in particular\u2014white and trees and the edge of train window\u2014and she texted back: drink water, and then, because she was a person who could not resist transformation, she added: and look for fox. He texted Raj a moose emoji followed by a question mark. He texted Gertie a picture of the dome with the caption: where angels and old men with stories live, and she sent him back seventeen wheat-sheaf emojis and a sound file of her saying in a stage whisper: do not disgrace Manitoba.\n\nEverything took longer than you think on trains because you have to wait for other versions of your plan to finish doing theirs on the rails. The freight hung around on sidings, enormous patience disguised as unwieldiness, and they stopped to let the work of the country pass them the way you hold a door for someone carrying something that might break your foot. Nobody in the car seemed especially upset by the delays because everything about the train asks you to consider that perhaps time hunger is a habit and not a requirement. If he felt a small bite of anxiety at the thought of arriving late into a city that would not wait for him to put his heart down and find the door he needed to find, he did not let it goad him. He looked at the schedule and at the printed sheet they had given him at the station and he did the math the way he did math for panels, with an acceptance that sometimes numbers can be persuaded by tone.\n\nAt a longer stop, somewhere that smelled like tin and frost, the smokers lined up under a sky that did not care about nicotine or sorrow. He stepped onto the platform because his bones wanted novelty. Cold ran up his pants like a prankster and then he was fine. The air had that bite that makes you stand straighter without permission. He had a thermos and cradled it in his hands and sipped in the church of outdoors because coffee has souls in it when you are facing a line of trees that you will never, ever be able to name. A woman beside him lifted her face to the blue as if she had an argument with it. \u201cMy nephew lives in Owen Sound,\u201d she said, apropos of the sky. \u201cHe says people in Toronto do not know how to drive, and I tell him: people anywhere forget their hands when the streets are large.\u201d\n\n\u201cHands are everything,\u201d he said, because he was an electrician and the statement needed no qualification.\n\nShe nodded. \u201cYou look like a man who fixes small things as if they were big,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are grateful for you, even if we\u2019re not in your house when you\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nBack in his seat, he found he had become enough of a person in the car for someone to slide a crossword toward him with the nib of a pen pointed at 18 down. \u201cConductor\u2019s call,\u201d the boy with the cards said, excited to share puzzle as if it were a contraband candy. \u201cSix letters.\u201d\n\n\u201cTickets,\u201d someone said from two rows back, and the boy glowed as if he had been offered a job. They filled in words together for a few minutes and it felt like the sort of community that can only exist between strangers, a temporary country with no taxes and polite customs.\n\nWhen the light tilted down toward evening, domes collected people again. The car drew out of it the people who did not yet know what it was they wanted and then gave it to them, the trees in that end-of-day color that looks like the inside of a ripe pear. Snowmelt in ditches crusted over in sudden cold looked like glass put down by someone who had intended to come back to it with a sketchbook. The rhythm altered, the train negotiating a section of track that had opinions, and a small girl said wow at exactly the moment you would want a small girl to say wow and everyone let out the breath they didn\u2019t know they were holding because it is kind when someone does the feeling-labor for you out loud.\n\nHe slept in the hunched, undignified posture of economy class, his neck making a list of complaints and then agreeing to deliver them later to his pillow rather than now to the car. He woke at odd hours and the outside was another country each time, night having made arenas of the spaces between trees. He went to the snack car at two in the morning because he wanted to test the theory that all coffee tastes better when bought at an hour that makes your future self frown, and found it wrapped in a glow that made everyone look like actors on a set where the set dresser had been paid for their good taste. He bought a coffee that was mostly generosity and a cookie that had a surprising integrity, and he took both to a seat by the window and looked at his own reflection as if he were a man he had not met yet. A couple in their sixties argued softly about the route of a road they had driven thirty years ago. A young guy with a tattoo of a swallow on his neck gazed at his phone with the tenderness of a parent at a sleeping child. The attendant ran a rag along the counter with that eternal rhythm of people who tend small, necessary surfaces.\n\nThere was a flicker at the far end of the car, the overhead lights doing the indecisive blink that heralds either a bulb in its last act or a switch complaining about age. The attendant\u2019s face did the quick math of potential annoyance. It was impulsive, or maybe it was the sort of impulse that has been trained to think of itself as duty, but Nate lifted a palm like a student and said, \u201cDo you mind if I take a look.\u201d He said it softly so as not to call himself what he didn\u2019t want to be called, a savior for something that didn\u2019t require one.\n\nThe attendant looked at him and then at his hands and then at the small screwdriver peeking from his pocket because there are tells to competency. \u201cIf you can sweet-talk that fixture into giving me another two days, I\u2019ll buy your coffee,\u201d she said, and he smiled because the coffee was already drunk but the deal was good in spirit and that\u2019s what mattered.\n\nHe climbed up on the little bench, careful, deliberate, holding himself lightly as if his body could be made shame-proof by grace. He popped the lens cover with a practiced wrist and set it on the counter like a delicate object even though it was plastic that could take a joke. He checked the connections, snugged the wire in the tiny clip that had clearly been jostled by time and the particular jiggle of trains, and saw the flicker settle out to a calm he could feel as much as see. He replaced the cover, wiped his palm on his jeans in that universal gesture of done, and stepped down to a small chorus of ah, which is the sound humans make when the world remembers itself. The attendant slid him a napkin with a scribble on it and he laughed when he read it later. The napkin said: one free cookie redeemable upon proof of sorrow. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ll have one worth a cookie at some point,\u201d she said, and he waved the napkin like a white flag, like an agreement, like permission.\n\nThe hours between dusk and perfect night passed in murmurs. He slept a little more and dreamt nothing he could retrieve. At dawn he was awake before the light and then in it when it arrived, the forest becoming more itself. Northern Ontario unrolled in patient squares and circles of stubborn growth. Rock shouldered up out of the earth as if to say: I remember glaciers and you do not. Lakes appeared and left with a shyness that made you wish to apologize as you looked at them. Occasionally a moose-shaped dark would be insisted upon by someone and then apologized for when it turned into a bush with too much confidence. He saw a fox. He saw it with the uncomplicated joy of someone whose mother had made a prediction that the universe had decided to honor. It moved across a clearing with a pace that had nothing to do with human time. He lifted his phone for the picture and then did not, because he wanted to have something that was only for him and his mother and anyone he loved enough to tell.\n\nHis mother answered on the second ring when he called from a little vestibule that smelled like coin and cold and the kind of oil that makes magic under metal. \u201cFox,\u201d he said, without preamble, proud as if he had made the animal out of spare buttons and ingenuity. She made a sound on the line that was half laugh and half old country blessing. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cNow do not get cocky and look for wolf. There is arrogance and then there is foolishness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fixed a light,\u201d he said, and then laughed at himself because he had become someone whose updates were wildlife and bulbs, and he loved that for himself. He told her about the dome and about Jacques and the knitting, and she told him about how at Safeway they had moved the pickles to the other side of the aisle and she had stood there for an embarrassing amount of time thinking that perhaps the world had ended. When he hung up he had the feeling he had after successfully making a ground connection in an old house\u2014relief, hum, stability.\n\nBy the time they pulled into Sudbury Junction, a name that sounded like a person you might date in high school, the sky had gone a proper blue instead of the white that performs uncommitted impressions. Sudbury had a smokestack like a cigarette in a painting, obscene and necessary. People joined them with last-minute snow on their boots and the look of people who had just told someone they would behave and did not mean it. He stretched in the aisle with the courtesy a man gives to an aisle that has made room for his limbs. The boy with the cards had acquired a friend, and they were now playing in a way that involved slapping and shouts stifled into smaller, more train-appropriate shouts.\n\nHe met a man in the dome later with a camera lens long enough to make Chadwick Boseman\u2019s cheekbones feel surveilled from a city away. The man spoke about light like it owed him money. \u201cThe shield,\u201d the man said, pointing with his chin at the world as if the earth were a smaller thing that could be indicated usefully. \u201cAncient rock. It makes a man feel new and tired at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fix things that pretend they want to die,\u201d Nate said, and the man considered this politely as if he were taste-testing a metaphor, and then nodded as if it passed.\n\nHe dozed and woke and the hours compressed the way they do when you are both eager and content. He thought about the contest in a way that settled into him like good bread: heavy, satisfying, not swollen with air. The emails had clarified that there would be press and he reminded himself he could be funny enough to give the cameras something that wasn\u2019t just a caught-in-headlights face full of pastry. He thought about the other contestants, avatars on a page he had half-stalked. A woman from Halifax who had opinions on meringue that could serve as a manifesto. A man from Calgary whose Instagram was a parade of gym and bakery and who had, inexplicably, founded a charity knitting club that made hats shaped like pies for babies. A teen from northern Quebec whose entire vibe was two parts sugar anarchist, one part grandma-approved tradition, and one part haircut that frightened mothers.\n\nThey made Toronto in the gray that city centers wear in winter\u2014the particular gleam of wet steel, the way the light refuses to be loyal to any one building, the cold rising from the stone like a rumor of something that had happened long ago. Union Station\u2019s platforms were caves that hummed with commerce. He stepped down into the bath of noise as if into water and felt the edges of himself come up alert. The hall was bright and loud, its fonts declaring a modernity that felt like it was politely ignoring Winnipeg\u2019s Beaux-Arts aunt. People moved with purpose, their luggage wheels yelling their thoughts into the hollow of the ceiling. He followed the flow, a fish in a school, and found himself spat into that part of Toronto that insists it is the center of all maps\u2014taxis and glass, buskers doing their valiant printed-scarf tricks, a woman in a coat so excellent it made his hands itch because he wanted to tell her that someone somewhere had loved her enough to hand her this and say wear it, be brilliant.\n\nHe shouldered his bag and let his body catch up with the speed of this place. He had a cheap hotel two subway stops away, a room that promised a bed and a television that would try to sell him a better mattress than the one he was lying on. He found the subway with the help of signs that were determined to be helpful in two languages and three moods, bought a pass because he liked the feeling of a card opening something, a door, a day, and stood in the train as it needed him to. Toronto under Toronto moved like a river that had learned grammar. He watched how people made room for each other and bumped anyway and apologized and sometimes didn\u2019t. Winnipeg had taught him to make a face at this and then forgive it. He put his bag by his feet and resisted the politely feral instinct to smile at strangers because he knew here that could look like an insult or worse, an invitation.\n\nThe hotel was exactly what the internet had promised and precisely less, which meant he trusted it. The desk clerk was soft-spoken in a way that made everyone else in the lobby a bad decision. The carpet had a geometry it had not consented to. The bed was so determined to be a bed it almost apologized for its own rectangle. He dropped his bag on the chair that he wouldn\u2019t use for anything except holding his bag because there is something about it being there that tells a room: I am not moving in, calm down. He put his hand on the window and felt the city through the glass, a hum across his skin, and thought about calling his mother and decided to check in with the part of him that had come all this way. He sat on the bed, folded in the middle where the cheap mattress confessed itself, and took out the bib. He had told himself he wouldn\u2019t wear it in the mirror because that felt like tempting fate on the level of telling a house you didn\u2019t like its wallpaper. He draped it over the chair instead. The wheat sheaf in the corner. A Manitoban banner that looked like it had not been drawn by a committee but by a hand that understood wheat as the emblem not of quaintness but of a stubborn insistence on life.\n\nHe walked down to the venue later because walking is how you reclaim a city from your nerves. It was a market space turned competition hall, lights strung so that it looked like a wedding had agreed to accommodate sport. The stage had three long tables bracketed by cameras like curious geese. Volunteers in t-shirts the color of victory moved with the helpfulness that comes with being fed and appreciated. He found Drew at a registration table framed by a display of fonts. Drew\u2019s eyebrows lifted when he saw him, the quiet satisfaction of a spreadsheet reconciled and an old man\u2019s story about the dome car confirmed. \u201cYou made it,\u201d he said, as if conferring an achievement rather than narrating a fact.\n\nHe signed where he was told to sign and read what he was told to read and adopted his laminated badge with the light embarrassment that comes from wearing your own name under your face. \u201cMedia run-through at ten,\u201d a bright volunteer named Frankie told him cheerfully. \u201cInterview after your heat. We\u2019re rescue dogs with hydration if you need it. And yes, the pies are identical. That question comes up more than hearts can bear.\u201d\n\nHe walked the floor and felt the particular shiver that comes from all the electricity in a room being eager at once. He stood at the edge where his table would be, looked at the row of plates he was allowed to consider as instruments and not just plates, at the stack of napkins, at the little display that indicated that some part of this would be pretend. He thought of the boy with the cards and of Jacques and of the fox. He thought of the light in the snack car and of the little horse tail that had been persuaded to return to a destiny it had wandered away from. He could feel the part of him that wanted to take this all too seriously, the part that believed that the way you do any small thing is the way you will do it all and that therefore this mattered like a proof of character. He gently sent that part of himself to sit in the corner and watch. He would let another part of himself\u2014the one that had laughed with his face purpled by Saskatoons\u2014hold the forkless instrument of his absurd craft.\n\nHis phone buzzed while he was standing there, absorbing the very idea of Toronto being willing to make room for a prairie man\u2019s minor glory. His mother had sent a picture of his kitchen window with the note: I watered the plant. It looked at me like a suspect. He smiled back at the image as if it could feel him. Gertie sent a voice memo that was ninety percent bracelets clinking and ten percent, \u201cRemember: mouth like a machine and heart like a poet.\u201d He received a text from the Winnipeg Agricultural Society that consisted entirely of a cartoon sheaf of wheat lifting a tiny barbell. Raj sent, succinctly, run the table.\n\nHe took a breath the way the good runners do, not in his throat but in his ribs. He looked around at the other contestants finding their places, some of them wearing seriousness that did not suit them yet but would, perhaps, by the end. He looked at the cameras and at the volunteers and at the table where a man from a television station would later ask him how to spell Kowalsky and how much pie a person could put in his mouth and still call himself a gentleman. He touched his chest like a man reminding himself where he had put his keys. He thought about how many hands had carried him here, the literal and the metaphorical ones, and felt a gratitude that did not require an audience. He tasted mustard, ancient and fresh on the back of his tongue, and imagined a fox moving through trees where no one else could see it and knew he was exactly where he had decided to be. He stood. He waited for the whistle that would turn the next few minutes into a story he would tell and tell until it became the shape of this year. He did not pray, because this was not that, but he did the second-cousin of prayer. He promised himself that he would not be stingy with joy. He promised himself that whatever this was, it would count. He let the city, his city and this city, settle around him like jackets borrowed from good people. When Drew\u2019s voice rose and the room turned itself into attention, he smiled, a small upward motion that had traveled a long way to find its place.Chapter 5\n\nThe whistle was not a whistle so much as a decision cut into air. It made people straighten, it made cameras remember their marks, it made volunteers who had been smiling in an abstract way begin to smile in a directed way, at faces they could anchor to later in stories and captions. The pies had already been placed with the solemnity of chess pieces, nine to a table, a grid that would soon lose its straight lines. Butter tart pies, glossy and brown as polished desk wood, the surface tremoring slightly if you breathed too hard near them. Ontario had chosen its emblem and it made sense; sugar here had a note of history about it, the kind that came in under the date on a ledger and stayed.\n\nNate found his stance and then chose not to think of it as a stance because stances were for people who thought they needed to declare in advance who they were. He rolled his shoulders and let his breath flatten and settle where it was supposed to live, not high in his throat but where his ribs could help. The plastic bib lay cool against his neck, wheat sheaf at the corner like a companion who had opinions but had promised to keep them to himself until the appropriate time. He looked left and right once, not competitive, just curious. On his left a woman with hair in a braid that had known other braids gave him a quick nod, businesslike. On his right a man in a fitted t-shirt that suggested familiarity with kettlebells bounced on his toes once, the kind of bounce intended to shake foolishness out of calves and keep only purpose.\n\nDrew\u2019s voice rolled out over the room and made jokes at the edges like a man lighting candles in a draft. Somewhere in the press behind the cameras, he could hear a kid ask whether they would get to keep the plates. The answer was no, but it was the sort of question that made a room dearer. The judge with the microphone and the hair that had been asked to be aspirational explained the rules again in case someone had swapped their brain for nerves and needed to rehang their understanding on something simple. No hands. Eight minutes. Water if you want it. If you choke, we will stop you and nobody will be brave about it, we will just be kind. The room laughed where it was meant to and then settled in again, as if tucking knees under blankets.\n\nHe leaned, when the second signal came, the way he would lean into a cabinet to see which wire had decided to pretend it had no friends. The first bite was always reconnaissance. The butter tart filling had a caramel depth that argued with his instincts about speed. The crust was less delicate than Gertie\u2019s, more municipal, sturdy, a pie engineered to withstand Toronto. He adjusted his rhythm. He was not the fastest in the room and he knew it now, the same way a man knows when his drill\u2019s battery is just past the sweet spot. He compensated with efficiency. He didn\u2019t waste the bring down to the plate and the bring up to the mouth. He let his jaw do what it had been doing for him faithfully his entire life. He did not try to be interesting; he tried to be good.\n\nHe heard the crowd in an underwater way, the hollers and the deliberate cheers patterned by friendship and by signage. He knew exactly when a camera found him because some part of the room\u2019s attention sharpened like a knife angled at light. He thought of the boy on the Winnipeg trail with the pizza-box sign and did not laugh because laughing cost time. He breathed in counts\u2014small, small, long\u2014and let the filling be what it was, a glue of memory and the bragging rights of sugar. He did not think about the absurdity of this as evidence of character. He did not think about his mother\u2019s voice from the week before blessing and scolding him into balance. He kept his face aimed at the work like a man who knew how to be loyal to something when he had said yes to it.\n\nAround minute six, the woman with the braid found a gear that made him admire and not envy her. She did a neat thing with her tongue at the edge of the crust and it turned what should have been scrabble for crumbs into choreography. The man with the kettlebell calves faltered, not in heart but in plan, and lifted his head too long between bites, hunting air as if he\u2019d misfiled it. Nate found his steady. He thought about the dome car and the rhythm of track under him and let that become the metronome for his ridiculous work. He was a person who cherished the steady, and here was a place to employ it in honorable silliness.\n\nWhen the horn at eight brought hands up and heads up and napkins forward, the room exhaled as if it had been underwater with him. He sat back with the happy exhaustion of a person who had made sense of something only his mouth could understand. He took the water and rinsed and took another and actually drank it. The cameras were already on the faces that had made comedy out of their effort. The microphone on its official stick was somewhere else, and he was grateful for that brief non-inspection, a courtesy after intimacy. He looked down his row and saw the remains of pies that looked like maps, rivers of filling, continents of crust. His plate was almost virtuous in its tidiness, a thing he would never say aloud because the world does not reward people who boast of neatness.\n\n\u201cClean,\u201d said a voice above him, and he looked up into a grin he recognized from nights of internet sign-ups and poster-font decisions. Frankie, with her bright t-shirt, had materialized. She had a clipboard covered in stickers about hydration. \u201cYou are a champion of the paper towel economy,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was almost dainty, which is not a word we deploy often here. How do you feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a man who has done something unsuitable to the idea of breakfast,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd proud of how thoroughly unsuitable I committed.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, checked his name off, and slid a napkin to him with the sort of flourish that meant she had found her place in the theater of this. \u201cInterview three to your left if you want it. No obligation. You have pie on your ear but it feels like a personality choice.\u201d\n\nHe wiped his ear obligingly and went where the people with microphones were performing friendliness professionally. A woman with lipstick that made promises put a mic under his chin and made his name sound like it had three stages of life. He spelled it politely. She asked him which was worst, blackberry or butter tart, and he said there was no worst, there was only commitment. He said he was an electrician and that eating pie competitively taught you breath and patience, which were a kind of wire discipline. He said Winnipeg had sent him with a wheat sheaf and a sense of humor and that both had made it through security. He was pleased later to realize he had not flinched when her eyebrows arched at the mention of a sponsor that sounded like agriculture. He didn\u2019t care to let wheat be set up as quaint. Wheat had fed him and everyone he knew until other kinds of feeding were possible.\n\nHe watched strangers watch him answer questions and thought of domes again, the way the glass makes people softer without making them less serious. The Halifax woman was giving a better interview two spots down, speaking about the ethics of sugar and why she didn\u2019t trust corn syrup because it had never been honest with her. The teen from Quebec, \u00c9lodie, who had hair like a deliberate thunderstorm and a hoodie that looked absurd until you read the back and saw the message about grandmothers and recipes and the science of stubbornness, stood with her hands folded as if she were praying and scowled into the camera as if she hated it and then produced a smile as if she had picked it out of a pocket and was testing to see if it fit. The Calgary man\u2014Ty, if the hand-marker on his badge could be trusted\u2014leaned into the microphone like a person who had never been taught to be afraid of a room and said cheerful things that would cut well into ads.\n\nPreliminary results went up on the big screen with the menace of font, then sorted themselves into something like a temporary fairness. He was fourth in his heat, which meant he would get a second chance, a wildcard chew-off at two against other almosts. He took that in without flinching. His pride did not bruise easily because it had been raised by people who believed that daily work done with attention is the point and everything else is bonus. He texted Raj fourth, and Raj sent back a GIF of a man adjusting a hat with concentration, and then added: you love second chances. He texted his mother a picture of the wheat sheaf on his bib and no words and she sent back: I am at Safeway looking at the old pickle shelf in case they apologize to me by moving back. Good luck, son. He texted Gertie a single fork emoji and she returned a voice file that originated in bracelets and ended in shouting. \u201cCrush them with grace,\u201d she said. \u201cMake butter repent.\u201d\n\nWith hours to fill and a stomach that had made its opinion known about further pastry, he went outside. Toronto in daylight had a swagger that made him feel both loyal to his quieter city and eager to borrow a little of the flex. He let himself be carried on sidewalks that had nowhere for snow to sit and threw the kind of looks at buildings you reserve for people whose shoes you cannot afford but whose walk makes you reconsider your own. He went into the market because markets were his kind of chapel\u2014goods honest about being goods, people who could talk about salt and plum sauces with the conviction of someone defending a thesis. He bought a small container of pickled carrots he didn\u2019t need and ate three because he wanted the kind of crunch that reminded his jaw it could do honorable work without sugar. He stood at a stall and listened to a woman try to choose between seven kinds of olives without anyone laughing at her problem. He thought, as he always did in places like this, of all the hands, all the electricity quietly doing secular miracles above and behind and beneath, keeping cold cold and warm warm, certainly and humbly.\n\nHe might have stayed moving until the nerves resolved themselves into a quiet that would carry him, but his phone buzzed with a text from a number he didn\u2019t have saved. The text was polite in a way that suggested it had a job: hall C practice area if you want to meet your fellow wildcards, beverages involved, perhaps a debrief about the peculiarities of this particular crust. He was not against beverages or community-led reconnaissance. He went.\n\nHall C had a backstage feel\u2014tape on floors and techs in black moving like carefully choreographed shadow. There was a cluster of chairs and a carafe of coffee that had been brewed to meet the minimum standard of meeting coffee. The three other almosts were already there. The braid woman said her name was Moira and that she had never before seen volunteers move so tidily in their t-shirts. \u00c9lodie offered a hand without softening her face and introduced herself as if daring anyone to mispronounce it. Ty gave him a knuckle bump as if that were how men were required to meet somewhere west of Thunder Bay and his grin was as neat as his beard.\n\nThey talked like people who had been assigned the same difficult math problem and needed to compare the shapes of their work without cheating. They discussed crust density and the way butter tart filling glued to the palate in a way that made breath an interesting proposition. Moira had whole theories about whether you engaged the back molars or spared them and everyone listened because her braid had the gravity of elders. \u00c9lodie confessed to eating lemon the day before as training because she thought she might need a mouth reset, and then admitted that her grandmother had taught her never to enter a room hungry unless you wanted that room to own you. Ty spoke with calm zeal about tongue placement and about the trick of turning shame off like a tap.\n\nThey could have stayed there, trading small sciences and jokes and the kind of half-boasts that make you human and not unbearable, but a volunteer with a badge that read JO in a font that deserved its own applause stepped in with a clipboard that had broken two rings and continued valiantly. \u201cWildcards,\u201d Jo said with cheer that had been sustained by something other than sleep, \u201cyou\u2019re at two. House asks that you please refrain from pre-eating anything that could be construed as performance-enhancing, which apparently includes peanut butter. We live in a world of rules for reasons none of us will ever fully understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeanut butter is a character study,\u201d Moira said dryly. \u201cIt never said it wanted to hurt anyone.\u201d\n\nThey laughed and that was the point. They laughed because they needed to be part of something between panic and purpose. They went to the practice tables and mimed mouth-work in a way that would have been mortifying if they had not all been doing it at once. They were adults, after all, and the secret is that adulthood is a series of decisions to ignore the part of your brain that tells you dignity is fragile. They took sips of water and swished and spat in a trash can labeled compost as if they were at a wine tasting conducted by impish gods. Nate felt the warmth of companionship rise in him like good coffee. He liked these people. He wanted them to do well, even as he wanted to do better. He liked that wanting both could function at once.\n\nThe wildcard round began with less ceremony, which suited him. Fewer speeches, more work. The pies were set down with almost impatience, the judge\u2019s hair had relaxed, Drew\u2019s voice was still a herald but he let the sigh of a room finding second gear do some of his lifting. Nate\u2019s slot put him at the edge of the table where he could see a banner for a salt company dancing at the end of a draft. He fixed his gaze on the crust and pretended the banner did not exist because moving things wanted to be followed and he wanted to lead.\n\nThe first minute went well, too well. He forgot to stay in his body and let his head float up into the rafters, where it observed himself with the chilly remove that makes for excellent criticism and terrible performance. He nearly laughed at the stupidity of his own attention. He pulled it down again by counting his chews in French, because his mother\u2019s French was a soft coat and he knew that if he occupied himself with syllables he would keep his lungs honest. Un, deux, trois, quatre, and so on, until the numbers stopped being numbers and became beats.\n\nAt minute three he choked, not on a bite but on a memory. It arrived uninvited and full-bodied: the kitchen table at eight, his mother\u2019s hand flattening dough with a wine bottle because she didn\u2019t own a rolling pin. Butter on fingers, flour on floor, laughter that had a catch to it because rent was due. The opposite of butter tarts, a savory pie with onion and potato that had fed two boys and a woman and given them the kind of confidence that can carry you across a week. It hit him like a gust through a door not adequately sealed. He paused\u2014half a beat, not enough for anyone to see except the part of him that treasures exactness\u2014and then he kept going. He swallowed, and not just pastry.\n\nHe made the finish. Clean, again, not a monk\u2019s plate but a neat man\u2019s. He took the water with gratitude and nodded when Frankie appeared again, as if she might have been sent to measure his pulse. Ty whooped, fully himself, when it ended; Moira wiped the corner of her mouth with a napkin the way a woman might do in a dining room with linen; \u00c9lodie turned away and laughed, finally, at something her friend said in rapid French and the room moved on to the next thing because rooms always do.\n\nResults were announced with less font drama. His name was third on the list, which meant he could proceed to the finals with the steady inside him intact. He grinned in the direction of the big screen as if anyone could see him and texted Raj a single wheat sheaf. Raj responded with a picture of his own face making a noise. His mother texted: you were born with cheeks for this, which he did not care to parse. Gertie sent a series of exhortations that were either prayers or recipes.\n\nHe had hours until the final, and this time instead of walking he let himself sit. There was a chair against a wall near a service door where air from extra winter was let in occasionally by the comings and goings of things on dollies. He closed his eyes, not to sleep but to rehearse the breathing that had saved him. He put his hands on his knees and felt the blessed ordinary of bone and tendon. Someone sat down beside him and he opened his eyes out of courtesy because private sorrow can be had with eyes closed but private joy should be shared, even if only by proof of witness.\n\nIt was Moira, braid now a little looser, mouth caramel-sticky at the corner where napkin had apparently staged its retreat. She offered him a peppermint, a small act of solidarity with the conspiratorial air of dubious sports rituals. \u201cMy grandmother,\u201d she said, by way of explanation, \u201cbelieved that peppermint tells your heart to stop trying to make all the decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will obey your grandmother,\u201d he said, and let mint reassert the parts of his mouth sugar had colonized. They sat in the way people do who have only a few hours of acquaintance and the sense that a strange affection has set up a tent in the middle of their day and invited itself to tea. She told him about Halifax winds and how you learn to love a city that tries to push you off its sidewalks. He told her about Union Station\u2019s cream ceiling and how the dome car had made him feel like he had been allowed to be an organ inside a larger animal.\n\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll do this again,\u201d she asked, not fishing for a particular answer, curious in the way that good listeners always are.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I like the part where the room decides to make a silly thing sacred. I like being allowed to be the kind of person who shows up for that. It feels like the good parts of church without the parts that make me itch.\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cI was raised to believe the itch is the point,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do like when we make small joys into public work. It reminds me we are capable of more than the bureaucracy would suggest.\u201d\n\nThey were interrupted by the sound of something that had been asked to be silent and refused. A string of lights over the demo kitchen at the back of the hall had begun a stutter that would give someone a headache and give the camera operators a reason to send emails in all caps later. The nearest volunteer looked at it with the committed helplessness of a person whose to-do list had already reached the length where any new responsibility felt mythological. He could have stayed seated. He had saved his people a light at two in the morning. He was not morally obliged to fix every glowing thing in the country. He stood anyway and walked the gentle, not-interfering walk of a man who knew how to approach a problem without announcing himself as its hero.\n\nThe house tech had already arrived with a step ladder that made an unpleasant harmonic like a fork run hard around a plate. She looked at him with a squint that measured time and possible competence. \u201cAre you going to tell me how to do my job,\u201d she said, not unkindly, bracing her boot on the bottom rung and checking her belt for a tool she had likely loaned to someone earlier.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to offer to hold the ladder,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd ask you if you\u2019d like the extra pair of hands we all pretend not to need.\u201d\n\nShe grinned despite herself and tilted her head toward the ladder in invitation. He planted his feet and held. She climbed with confidence and flipped the housing open with a wrist motion that would have made Jacques in the snack car approve. \u201cConnector is sulking,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I bully it, it will behave for six hours and then tell tales about me.\u201d He passed her the little roll of electrical tape that hung on her belt and then the small flathead she had tucked in her back pocket. She snugged a wire, coaxed a clip, and the lights remembered their duty. The shadow behind the demo kitchen retreated back into wherever shadows are supposed to go during a broadcast.\n\n\u201cYou have ladder-holding hands,\u201d she said, coming down with the neatness of a person who had rehearsed this descent in the theater of their head for years. \u201cThey do not flinch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have practice,\u201d he said. \u201cIn holding and in flinching. I try to choose the former.\u201d\n\n\u201cBless you,\u201d she said, and then, because blessing was not quite her vocabulary, she added, \u201cand thanks.\u201d\n\nHe went back to his seat and sat with his hands in his lap, palms up for a minute as if catching something invisible, and Moira looked at him with a face that had moved, in their short acquaintance, from appraisal to acceptance. The peppermint thinned into thought. He closed his eyes again and did not so much think of the final as hold the idea of it gently, like something you do not want to crush by enthusiasm.\n\nThe final called them with extra glitter in the voice. The crowd had cooked itself into the temperature that makes clapping feel like part of breathing. The pies were new and looked impossibly identical in their sameness, which is the trick of show food, that you must present the idea of food back to the world as if you were telling a story about nourishment instead of giving it. He took his place and felt his knees do that little tremble that meant, simply, that he was alive. He let it be a reminder and not an indictment.\n\nThree finalists, three plates, three empty glasses set just so. Someone had made a graphic. Their names arranged themselves in a line above their heads in the big screen and there was something touching about it, as if the world had decided to write on the sky certain words it loved for the afternoon. He looked at his name and felt the letterforms become briefly unfamiliar, as if he belonged to someone else in that moment and would be returned intact after the horn. \u00c9lodie stood on his left and bounced once, not like Ty, not for calves, but like a small bird shivering itself into readiness in cold. Moira on his right did not move at all, and that, too, was a choice. He wanted to put a hand on each of their arms, like a coach in a movie, and say something that would land in their muscles, but the world did not need him to manufacture meaning where there already was plenty.\n\nThe horn cut the idea in half and they bent. Butter tart again, of course, the final meant to be the same as the test in case the narrative of practice had any moral weight. It was instinct now and not calculation. He let himself be a metronome with habits. He thought of fox and mint and dome and all of it dropped like pennies into the deep jar of his body and did what pennies do there\u2014made a dense song of small metal statements. There were yells; there were the helpful cries of people with signs; there was the particular sound a volunteer with a camera makes when they realize they are in the shot and must back up both eagerly and discreetly. There was his own breath, steady itself and asking only for the simple kindness of being given a plan. He was giving it one. He let his mouth be shameless and his heart be tender and his hands be still in view of everyone to satisfy the rule.\n\nHe lost track of the minute marks in a way that did not bother him because he was not living this to make time his pet but to prove to himself he could inhabit eight minutes without backing out. He thought of his mother\u2019s socks in his bag and of the man with the camera on the train and of Jacques\u2019s story about the bloody ticket. He kept eating. He kept going. The horn at the end was a mercy and a surprise and a sting because endings always have a little of that in them, even when they arrive on schedule.\n\nThey put their napkins down with too much dignity, which made the thing funny rather than sad. The judges conferred for longer than he thought necessary but necessary is not a measure that belongs to joy. He did not look at the screen for the replay that would show him doing a thing that looked both braver and sillier than he had felt; he kept his eyes on the little pattern in the paper napkin under his glass because small designs had saved him before, in kitchens and in halls and inside panels, when he needed to remember that the world had been arranged thoughtfully by someone, at some point, and therefore could be borne.\n\nThey announced Moira third and the room cheered in the way a room cheers a woman who has comported herself as if she has nothing to prove until suddenly she does and then proves only the thing she chooses. They announced his name second and he felt the swallow in his throat do complicated good work. He took the yellow ribbon they had printed for second and let it be what it was\u2014beautiful and a little ridiculous\u2014and he grinned in a way that made his cheeks ache. \u00c9lodie\u2019s name for first made a clean sound in the air and she startled as if someone had set off a harmless firework two inches from her ear. She covered her mouth with her hand and then, as if she had been instructed by a grandmother in a dream about how to behave when praise refuses to be coy, she uncovered it and wiped her cheeks and let herself be photographed like someone proving that they would not waste this.\n\nThere was noise. There were microphones. There was a man from the Agricultural Society who had somehow made it to Toronto with a wheat pin in his lapel and damp eyes that he pretended were about the travel. There were texts. There was a hand on his shoulder, warm and firm, that he knew before he turned belonged to Drew, who had the look of a facilitator whose spreadsheet had become a parade. There was a volunteer pressing a bottle of water into his palm as if he had run a race, as if this counted, and he knew it did, in the way that we assign weight to frivolities when they gather enough laughter around them.\n\nHe did the interviews again and did them better because he had practice and because his heart had done some work on the train with strangers. He told a man with a tape recorder that he loved the moment a silly thing and sincerity meet, that he would go home with a small second-place thing in his bag and that it would clutter his shelf in a way that could only improve the room. He told a woman with glasses that he had almost not come and that the universal fact of the world is that the trains exist and the people who help you buy tickets exist and if you are lucky there is pie at the end but if there isn\u2019t then there is still the dome and Jacques and fox and the peppermint that tells your heart to quiet down.\n\nHe got away, finally, escaping the stage by walking in plain sight like a man carrying a ladder in a room full of people who instinctively make way for someone with a tool. He found the quiet of a staircase that led nowhere anyone important would be going and sat with his ribbon in his lap and let himself be tired. His phone buzzed evenly, a string of congratulations from numbers that had found him, some belonging to people he would never meet who had decided for a day to take him into their possession as a thing to root for, the way cities allot themselves small saints for seasonal devotion. He answered what he could and allowed the rest to belong to the room, to the event, to the part of his life that would live a while online without him. He texted Raj a picture of himself with \u00c9lodie and Moira and the three of them holding up their little tokens with honesty and not a lick of mockery. Raj replied with a photo of Mrs. Banerjee\u2019s dog wearing, inexplicably, a paper crown, and the words: you remain intolerable in all the best ways.\n\nHe called his mother and she answered with the sound of her house behind her, the kettle pretending it had always been boiling. \u201cSecond,\u201d he said, and there was a beat exactly as long as a cheer being gathered and then let go.\n\n\u201cSecond is heaven,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst is a feast you cannot digest before people come asking for recipes. Second is food you can put in containers and eat all week. I am proud. Also, a woman in line in front of me just tried to use a debit card that did not exist and everyone decided to forgive her. Winnipeg sends you forgiveness and beets.\u201d\n\nHe almost said he had seen a fox again because he wanted to live in a world with omens, but he had not and he would not lie to make a story give him better gifts. He told her instead the truth of the peppermints and of Moira\u2019s braid and of the boy with the cards on the train and she made approving noises at all the right places. He did not notice until afterward that he had given her very little about the pie itself and much about the people, and that seemed right. The pie had been a structure to house the real work, which was attention.\n\nBy the time he stepped out into Toronto\u2019s evening, the city had put its jewelry back on. Light climbed up buildings in stacks and made people look like they had been asked to play versions of themselves and had agreed. He walked toward his hotel because there was nothing left to do except what there always is\u2014eat something worthy, drink water, sleep. He found, on the way, a small place that advertised Ukrainian food with less embarrassment than he had expected and the kind of plastic-cut plant in the window that told him someone inside had decided to be tidy about hope. He went in. He ate borscht that tasted like a memory written by someone else\u2019s aunt and perogies that were less delicate than his mother\u2019s and more frank than his. He sat with his ribbon in his pocket and did not take it out because it took up exactly the right amount of space where it was. He left a tip he could afford and thought about how sometimes spending a little on something after a win is not bad stewardship but celebration, and that too is a skill a man can learn without collapsing anything useful inside himself.\n\nBack in the room, he put the ribbon on the cheap dresser with the wheat bib under it and the effect, to his eye, was ridiculous and perfect. He took a picture of it and did not send it to anyone because he wanted one image to belong only to him. He brushed his teeth for a long time and then again because the butter tart had declared a residency and he was the landlord. He lay down and felt the city under him, the hum that was not his but that he could borrow. He had the thought, just before sleep took his hand and led him through a door, that he would fix the humming light again at the snack bar if asked and that there was something in that impulse that mattered more than any ribbon ever would. He dreamed of trains and of small horses with mended tails running beside them, unafraid of the noise, sure of the track because someone in the car above was holding a ladder for someone else and the light, when tested, did not flicker.Chapter 7\n\nWinnipeg took him back the way a good coat takes you back when you shrug into it\u2014without commentary, with a few familiar creaks, with the smell of thaw embedded in the lining. March had decided to rehearse at the edges, streaking the snowbanks with a graying that looked like the city\u2019s five o\u2019clock shadow. On the boulevards, rinds of ice loosened their grip and the gutters began their annual soliloquy, water gossiping toward drains like it had a great deal to tell. The van started on the second try and Nate took it personally as a love letter he would not overinterpret, and he drove to his first job after Toronto with a ribbon in the glove box that he had already forgotten, twice, and then found again as if finding it were part of the bargain.\n\nThe job was at a community rink in St. James where the lights, as the caretaker put it, were \u201cdeciding to be poets about illumination.\u201d The fixtures hung from rafters that had seen a generation of fathers teach a generation of children to wobble confidently; the wood had the long, dry smell of a place you don\u2019t mind breathing in. He had been told, on the phone, that sometimes three lights went at once and sometimes two and sometimes they took turns winking like aunties who did not approve but adored. He parked by the chain-link fence where someone had tied scarves in team colors and where a handmade sign scolded: NO SLAPSHOTS DURING PUBLIC SKATE, which was the sort of rule this city wrote with affection that dared you to sulk.\n\nInside, the ice hissed gently under floodlights that were not quite up to the task, and a man in a jacket that bore the rink\u2019s crest approached as if hoping an electrician might also be a priest. \u201cThey\u2019re old ballasts,\u201d the man said, as if confessing that his house had dial-up internet. \u201cWe got a grant for half and then the rest was supposed to be bake sales, and then the bake sales became a fight about whether oatmeal counts as a cookie, which, frankly, it does not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will refrain from official rulings,\u201d Nate said, and looked up into the rafters with the squint of a man estimating both the cost and the stories. The metal housings had been installed in a rush sometime around the last millennium and had never forgiven anyone for it, and he could see where tape\u2014honest, earnest, foolish tape\u2014had been asked to serve as philosophy. He fetched his ladder from the van, the one with aluminum scuffs up its ribs from a winter\u2019s worth of Winnipeg interiors, and when he returned to the boards there were three dads and one mom already standing in formation because there is nothing about a rink that does not invite a person to be useful.\n\nHe let them hold the ladder because that was part of what had kept him human here\u2014hands under things, hands on rails, hands that did not pull but steadied. He climbed and coaxed the housings open with the measured sweetness of a man convincing a cornered cat to exit a cupboard. Behind him the rink\u2019s air carried the smell of old coffee and a child\u2019s wool hat and the particular metallic note of skates that have learned to take compliments. The ballasts had a sulk to them he recognized, the low, intermittent hum like a teenager preparing to apologize without ever intending to use the word sorry. He tapped and tightened and then replaced what needed replacing, and he did it with the mild ceremony he reserved for this sort of repair, because the repair mattered less than the theater of calm it brought with it and everyone in the stands needed that swallow of quiet as much as they needed light.\n\nWhen the fixtures came up, one and then three and then, grudgingly, five, the ice looked like it had forgiven the day. A cheer went up on the benches that was mostly children and partly adults who remembered, suddenly, being children, and the sound made him grin into the metal like a man being told by a stranger that the thing he loved about himself had been noticed. He came down the ladder to mitts offered in the shape of reward, paper cups pressed toward him like sacrament, coffee and chocolate in equal measure, and a woman in a toque with a pom-pom the size of a domestic cat said, \u201cYou fixed our winter,\u201d with a sincerity that should have embarrassed them all and did not.\n\nHe took his payment in a folded check that would not bounce and a dozen coupons for rink burgers that he suspected might be the kind of food that required youth to digest. He tucked the check into his wallet and the coupons into his pocket and let them make his hip feel like it had work to do, and he stood a minute longer at the boards to watch a boy in a red sweater gain the kind of balance that will make him trustworthy when he is fifteen. On his way out, the caretaker pressed a flyer into his hand and cocked his head like a bird asking if seed was still free. \u201cSpring Thaw Pie-Off is posting their judges on Friday,\u201d the man said, out of nowhere, as if gossip had moved up into the ducts. \u201cYou get to Toronto and back and the rumor is they might ask you to sit and nod and make pronouncements with a fork.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged the way men shrug when they have something small and excitable inside their chest and do not want the world to poke it. \u201cI have a face that can nod,\u201d he said. \u201cI practiced on trains.\u201d\n\nAt the Blue Goose later, Gertie had reorganized the front case so it faced the door with a belligerent prettiness. The pies were unapologetic circles dressed in golden armor, and there was a new sign bravely lettered by someone whose handwriting improved dramatically when they were told everyone would see it. SPRING THAW PATRON SAINTS, the top read, and then it listed names that were either legendary bakers or coworkers willing to be teased, and there, at the bottom, small and serious, was: N. KOWALSKY, LOCAL BOY, JAWS OF LIFE. He stood in the doorway with his hat in his hands and laughed, and the laugh eased something in him that had tightened on the drive into town when the sun took that watery angle between buildings that told you winter was eavesdropping.\n\n\u201cYou are a minor religion,\u201d Gertie said, from behind the counter, measuring cinnamon with the severity of a person ordering the behavior of stars. \u201cWe have candles. We have devotions. We do not yet have indulgences but we are working on it. Sit and tell me about the dome again, because I am a woman who can listen to the same story twelve times if the verbs behave.\u201d\n\nHe told her and didn\u2019t tell her, not because he was precious but because stories have layers and he wanted to let this one peel at its own pace. He told her about Jacques and his nose and his mother and doughnuts; he told her about the peppermint and about the boy with the cards; he told her he had fixed a light, and when he said that she made the kind of sound a person makes when listening to a wedding and someone says the right name. He didn\u2019t tell her about the way he had seen his mother\u2019s hands in his own when he steadied the ladder for the house tech in Toronto, because some things were best carried a while before being laid on a counter and offered as dessert, and he knew she would be there when he was ready to talk.\n\nBy the register, there was an envelope with his name on it in handwriting that knew the weight of a fountain pen. He raised his eyebrows and Gertie nodded like a magician refusing to reveal the mechanics. \u201cAgricultural Society,\u201d she said, as if she were saying the Saints or the Weather. \u201cHe said he is not finished interfering in your life, but only on months with an R in them.\u201d\n\nInside the envelope was a note on heavy paper that tried to be casual and fumbled, and a voucher from a local credit union with numbers on it he could read and pretend not to be amazed by. They wanted him to \u201chost\u201d a slice-and-sip night at the Fair\u2019s spring fundraiser, which turned out to be exactly what it sounded like\u2014adults with plastic cups of apple cider watching a man eat pie with technique, and then asking him questions about breath as if breath were a currency that might appreciate if they understood it. He felt, reading it, something that was not quite dread and not quite thrill but the good neighbor of both, the feeling you have when you walk out on thin ice you know to be trustworthy because you saw yesterday\u2019s footprints and the surface held.\n\nHe said yes of course in a way that implied he was a man who had been waiting for precisely this kind of absurdity. He marked the date in his book where he kept columns for what needed bolts and what needed talk. He had to finish the rink for the weekend, he had a laundry list of basements, he had the professional pleasure of a St. Vital bungalow whose owner had over-loved his dimmers until they became confessional, and amidst them all he now had to find a way to be a person who could stand in a room and let people look without deciding to hide behind a ladder. He could do it, he told himself, because he had done it, in an arena that smelled like caramel and judgment, and if he could do it there he could do it wearing a flannel shirt that had survived drywall.\n\nThe days installed themselves like switch plates. He pulled wire along joists in a crawlspace that had heard stories and kept them; he replaced a burnt-out breaker for a woman who insisted on giving him a mason jar of pickled beets as if electricity and beets could be stirred into the same stew and improve each other; he let a cat sniff his shoes and decide, finally, that he was not a threat, and the decision gratified him in a way he couldn\u2019t explain. Each night, the ribbon on his dresser nudged his eye and then let him look away, and some afternoons he would let his thumb slide the satin like a touch meant to confirm not pride but texture, and he thought of Jacques\u2019s punched tickets and the small snow of paper circles on the carpet.\n\nThere was weather, dramatic and unamused. A wet snow blew in on a Thursday, the kind that makes you understand why your boots exist, and then the temperature fell with the confidence of a headline. Winnipeg did what it always does\u2014it pulled its scarf up, it turned its face into wind in a posture of dignified defiance, it compensated. The calls that came in were a string of ordinary emergencies\u2014GFCIs that had decided fear would be their personality, furnace blowers that forgot their manners, basement lights that asked to be translated back into function\u2014and he spent a day moving from house to house like a stethoscope pressed to the city\u2019s chest, and he found he loved his day for its quiet competence. In the evening he got a text from an unknown number that turned out to be Moira, the braid woman, with a picture of a plate and a silver fork and the caption: Halifax insists we remain hungry, and he laughed because he understood what it was to be fond of a city and critical and to blend the two into a meal.\n\n\u201cJudges,\u201d Drew texted, with an attachment that was a PDF that had been designed by someone who believed in boxes. \u201cFriday noon. Wear scarves. There will be microphones. We\u2019ll be kind.\u201d\n\nHe told his mother because she had a right to know when her son\u2019s mouth had been officially invited to have opinions for a crowd. \u201cDo not wear black shirts,\u201d she said, practical and grave. \u201cIt makes crumbs look like confession. Wear blue so when you say wise things about crust people will believe you and also because it suits your eyes, even if you pretend you do not know this about yourself.\u201d He rolled his own eyes at himself for smiling and then did as he was told.\n\nHe walked to The Forks in a wind that had given up the argument for spring and opted instead to show everyone the shape of their cheeks. The festival had changed outfits, trading Saskatoon blues for the clean brown of butter and nuts, and the judges\u2019 table looked less like a stage and more like a long family argument with forks. He sat between a woman from a radio show who had opinions about nutmeg and the director of a local theater who had arrived with the body language of a man prepared to be surprised. Frankie slid him a clipboard with scoring rubrics that were both earnest and insane\u2014crust flake was a category, as was something called \u201cstructural moral argument,\u201d and he appreciated the city for tossing its weight behind a joke until the joke offered to pay rent. He took his job seriously in the sense that when he bit he closed his eyes because it felt impolite not to, and he described, when asked, a crust as \u201chonest work\u201d and a filling as \u201cthe right kind of apology,\u201d and afterward a woman in the crowd stopped him and said, \u201cI felt like you were talking about my ex-husband,\u201d which he did not know how to take and therefore took as a victory.\n\nOn the way home, he passed the municipal library where children were stacked in parkas on the carpet watching a man make shadow puppets convincing enough to make a ladybug terrifying. He cut down a side street where ice at the curb had decided it would be glass until June, and there he saw Mrs. Banerjee in a hat that made her look like a fancy teapot. The dog wore a sweater that might once have been a sock. She lifted her glove as if flagging a taxi, and in doing so accidentally signaled him to a stop.\n\n\u201cI saw you on the television,\u201d she said, and the way she said television made it sound like an oracle that resided in a cabinet. \u201cI am amused that we live in a society that will put a man under lights to discuss crust, and also I have notes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you do,\u201d he said, and bent to greet the dog, who pretended to tolerate him as part of a long con wherein one day Nate would be allowed to scratch the belly. \u201cDo I get a letter grade.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get an A when you remember that adjectives were invented by people who disapproved of nouns,\u201d she said, severe and fond. \u201cDo not be kind at the expense of truth. Also, your van door squeaks and everyone on this block believes it is the bird that starts spring at five thirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will oil it,\u201d he said. \u201cI will oil it with civic pride.\u201d\n\nShe narrowed her eyes and then smiled because it is difficult to remain stern when someone volunteers to improve a hinge for the common good. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cThe dog assumes spring is your fault and will ask you for an accounting when the snow returns on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nHe was halfway up his steps when his phone buzzed with a number that made him forget his key was in his hand. VIA RAIL, the screen declared with the impersonal punctuation of bureaucracy and the friendliness of a vacation timeline. He answered out of habit and curiosity, and a voice that could have belonged to any of the country\u2019s train stations said a series of words that lined up into a surprise\u2014customer appreciation, travel voucher, previous purchase, feedback call, random draw. He waited for a catch and could not find one except the kind that catches you at the sternum when life, at long intervals, conspires to repay you in symbols.\n\n\u201cWe have a voucher you may use within twelve months,\u201d the woman said, professional and ever so slightly pleased on his behalf. \u201cIt is our way of saying that time is not always an enemy and sometimes an ally, and that duct tape is not a solution on our trains but is perhaps a reasonable metaphor.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because he couldn\u2019t not, because the world had decided to be kind in a way that would be a story and he was in the mood for stories. He took the number and wrote it in his book with a pen that had been to Toronto and back, and he thought of Sudbury and the fox and Jacques and the napkin that purchased sorrow, and he felt that quiet expansion inside that is not joy exactly but is its cousin\u2014something like faith, except it involves fewer declarations.\n\nThe Fair\u2019s slice-and-sip turned out to be an event only a town that believes in itself could devise. There were twinkle lights and earnest chairs and paper plates printed with harvest scenes, and a man with a banjo in the corner making gentle noises so that the room would remember to smile. Nate stood with a plate and an absurdly long fork someone had lent him for theatrical effect, and at first he did the thing where he made small jokes to protect himself, and then he let the jokes go because he realized he had a room full of people who had decided to be generative rather than critical. He talked not about speed but about attention and about the discipline of breathing and about how he once had learned that strip, twist, cap was as close as he would get to a lullaby. He spoke about ladders, god help him, and the holding of them for other people, and midway through a sentence he saw a man in the back lower his head like someone who had just remembered being saved by something modest, and he knew he had said something true in public and not been punished.\n\nAfter, people came up with their questions and their stories and their auntie\u2019s recipes that required lard and a good marriage, and a girl of about seven with hair in the romantic state of perpetual tangles said, \u201cI want to be a fixer like you but with cakes,\u201d and he said, \u201cGood, then it will be easier to get invited to parties,\u201d and her mother laughed and he felt, with body-surety, that his city was a series of rooms where he could tell the truth about small things and not be corrected.\n\nWork continued to be a constellation of domestic dramas in need of practical endings. He went to a St. Boniface duplex where a new father had decided to rewire a nursery in the week before his child\u2019s arrival because mortality had arrived on the porch with a diaper bag, and he held the man\u2019s fear without putting his hands directly on it and showed him where to staple and where not to staple and said the words it is okay to hire help out loud so that the man would not have to extract his pride from under a refrigerator later. He went to a Norwood Park bungalow and installed under-cabinet lighting for a woman who had inherited her mother\u2019s cookbooks and had decided to live inside them for a while, and they talked about cardamom like it was a plot twist that proves the writer knows what she\u2019s doing. He went to a bank\u2019s back office where the breaker panel had been labeled by someone with a sense of humor and no handwriting, and he hung new labels and made them boring on purpose so that no one would one day pull the wrong thing in a hurry because whimsy had been allowed to masquerade as a schematic.\n\nHe heard from \u00c9lodie in a message full of abbreviations and exclamation marks that read like a song, and she sent him a picture of her with an elderly woman in a kitchen where the counter had seen tomatoes for fifty years, and she wrote, we\u2019re starting a youth pie club because why not and because teens should have knife skills and lungs, and he wrote back with a sincerity that did not feel like an intrusion, and he sent her a picture of the rink under lights with skate lines like a secret language. Moira mailed him a peppermint because some people take a bit and make it a ritual, and when he opened the envelope his kitchen smelled briefly like a gift shop in a town with an ethic.\n\nOn a Wednesday he drove out of town on a job whose address included the name of a road that had not decided whether it wanted to be gravel or virtue. A farmer had called, an older couple who had the voices of two people who had been weathered into kindness by work, and their barn\u2019s wiring made the man\u2019s nephew, an apprentice welder, nervous. He trundled up a drive that had ruts like biographies and parked by a house that had, over the years, been added to and apologized for in equal measure. The barn stood like a solemn animal and inside it the light swung from a beam where a swallow would be a minister come summer. He found splices that had been emergency solutions in an era when emergencies lasted decades, and he found cobwebs so dense he felt he owed them rent, and he replaced and tightened and put in a GFCI where a handwashing sink had been added and ignored by the gods. The farmer\u2019s wife brought him coffee so strong it could have worked nights, and she knew the names of the cats by sight and of the cows by hoof, and she told him about the time the hydro had gone out and the milk had not and how they had relied on the fussy diesel generator like a cousin who could be counted on to complain while saving your life.\n\nHe finished at twilight when the fields around them had returned to their idea of themselves\u2014flat with insistence, not empty but ready. The farmer gave him a sack of potatoes because payment comes in many shapes here, and as he drove back to the city the sky did a performance of colors that would have embarrassed the Pacific, and he thought about the voucher sitting in his book and the trains that would cut this very field in a line you could navigate by if the sun forgot you. He did not know where he would go, not exactly, but the ticket felt like a sentence you put on your tongue to practice saying it without flinching: I can leave and I can come back, and both are mine.\n\nHe was at the Blue Goose the next morning, because some mornings belonged to rituals and raisin toast and opinions spoken over sugar. Gertie had put out a pie that looked like a hymn, lattice so careful it could have passed inspection at a parade, and he ate without rushing because the hour did not stare at him. A boy at the counter that he did not recognize and yet knew\u2014ridiculous hoodie, eyes that were part suspicion and part offer\u2014watched him with the curiosity of someone deciding which older men were allowed in the neighborhood of their hopes. \u201cYou the pie guy,\u201d the boy said, not a question but not an accusation either, and Nate, because he had decided somewhere between Sudbury and home that he would not be stingy with joy even when addressed by its teenage dialect, said, \u201cI am a man who did a ridiculous thing and was rewarded with a ribbon, yes.\u201d\n\nThe boy considered and then nodded as if awarding legitimacy. \u201cCool,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was dumb and then my aunt was like, no, this is community, and I was like, okay, and then I cried a little but I will not talk about that here.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Nate said, and lifted his mug in a salute to the great emotional economy of small admissions. \u201cWhen you want to talk about it not here, find me, because that is also community.\u201d\n\nHe left the diner with a pie for his mother wrapped in paper that had been driven crazy by cinnamon, and he walked up his block under a sky that had finally, finally decided to learn brightness again, and he could feel the city lifting half an inch with him, because when the cold lets go there is a humility to the air that makes you forgive your own fingers. The van door squeaked once to remind him he owned oil and then stopped because he owned oil. He mounted the steps and found, tucked into the corner of his storm door like a confession, an envelope with a Calgary postmark and a handwriting like a man trying to behave and failing gracefully. Inside was a postcard with a picture of the world\u2019s largest perogy, which was a joke that did not know whether to be affectionate or ashamed, and Ty had written on the back: man, the kids at the gym made me eat blueberry protein \u201cpie\u201d and it was a crime; I told them you\u2019re the guy who would hold a ladder for a stranger and that is what heroes are; you coming west one day, you have a couch here and a pie club that wears weights. He propped the card against his salt shaker and wondered at the way the world had enlarged itself around him without demanding that he be louder.\n\nThat evening, after his calls had been logged and his receipts shoved into the diplomatic pouch of a man\u2019s pockets, Raj came by with beer and a story about a client who had paid him in a painting of her late dachshund and a bowl of grapes. They sat on the floor because the couch was still a project he had not finished budgeting for, and they leaned their heads back against the wall like kids who had ditched class and somehow ended up in a sanctified space. \u201cYou have a voucher,\u201d Raj said, and said it with the satisfaction of a man for whom instruments of mobility were almost erotic. \u201cWe are a people of coupons and opportunity. Where do you want to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot west,\u201d Nate said, because he had already arranged for west to be a later gift. \u201cMaybe east and not Toronto, something smaller. A town where trains are not an event but a pulse. Or north a little, where the trees remember things I do not. Or maybe nowhere and then somewhere when the word shows up on my tongue and fits.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Raj said. \u201cI enjoy that travel can be grammatical. You know, the dog wore a paper crown the day you won because Mrs. Banerjee did not have a ribbon and decided that monarchy could stand in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope she burned the crown when the snow came back,\u201d Nate said, and they both watched the window where their reflections sat with them like sudden guests, thin and earnest. For a time they were quiet the way men are quiet when love is too large for language but under no threat, and then they began the chew of trivialities again because triviality is sometimes how you protect what matters.\n\nWhen the call came on Friday, he was in a utility room in a building that smelled like old plants and new promises, and he let it go to voicemail because breakers do not like to be ignored in their hour of need. Later, in the van, he pressed the triangle and listened to Drew explain in his familiar blend of authority and invitation that the National Sweet had decided to film a special about \u201cregional saints\u201d and wanted to come to Winnipeg and ask him to help them not make a fool of themselves. \u201cWe are good at reverence,\u201d Drew said, words crisp and amused. \u201cThey are good at cameras. Let\u2019s see if we can make a meal that won\u2019t embarrass the aunts.\u201d\n\nHe stared at the windshield for an extravagant number of seconds because his brain was busy organizing itself into yes. He thought about his town\u2019s patience, about how cameras can be both magnifying and cruel, about the way he could put his body between a camera and something truly tender and say you may look but you will not take. He thought about the lights at the rink and the peppermint and the way \u00c9lodie had not softened her face until praise required it, and he thought that perhaps what he had been practicing all winter\u2014breath and stance and the permission to be joyful about small absurdities\u2014had been a rehearsal for a thing he had not named. He dialed and said yes in a voice that sounded like someone tightening a screw to the exact snugness it needed, and then he put the van in gear and joined the afternoon the way you join a crowd that is moving in a direction you are happy to be going, admiring the coats, making sure your own zipper is up, grateful for elbows and for the way your city knows your stride.Chapter 9\n\nThe film crew arrived on a Wednesday that looked like it had practiced its sincerity in the mirror. The snowbanks had been cut down into low gray loaves, the gutters were muttering to themselves with purpose, and geese flew overhead like punctuation, correcting the sentences winter had written all over the river. The email had called them a unit\u2014production unit, as if they were a battalion\u2014but the people who stepped off the shuttle and into the light had the look of individuals who had learned to share snacks and grudges on long drives. The showrunner was named Tessa and wore a coat like an intention. The cameraman, Lionel, had knees that told you he\u2019d crouched in the cold for a living, and a lens he touched the way other men touched heirlooms, careful and amused at the attention they were getting for their care. Yasmin, the sound op, had hair that dared the wind to try and was the sort of person who says hello to a building\u2019s exterior before going in. Behind them all trailed a young person in a wool hat with a clipboard\u2014the universal badge of someone\u2019s newness and competence\u2014whose name was Courtney and who chewed on the cap of a pen with the concentration of a squirrel saving up character.\n\nDrew met them with a laminated schedule and the calm of a person who knew how to move authority around until it looked like a friendly party. He pointed at Nate as if presenting a tool he was especially proud of. \u201cOur local,\u201d he said, which sounded like a role and also like something a bar keeps on tap for loyalists. Tessa shook Nate\u2019s hand and did the quick, efficient scan of a face that television people did, assessing angles, comfort, the likelihood a person will collapse into adjectives. \u201cWe want to show your city as itself,\u201d she said, and he heard the italics and did not resent them because at least she knew italics existed. \u201cWe want the room to feel like the room. Help us not build a bad prairie diorama. Help us not embarrass the aunts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can be a very bossy nephew,\u201d he said, and she laughed and then looked relieved when he didn\u2019t take the joke farther than necessary.\n\nThey had a list of locations that began as guesswork and ended as a map only someone who lived here could draw. The Blue Goose, of course, because you don\u2019t make a show about sugar in this city and ignore the room where opinions were plated and the coffee was more policy than beverage. The community rink in St. James, where the lights had been saved from their own drama and where children learned to wobble into competence under a ceiling that had not fallen in anyone\u2019s lifetime. His mother\u2019s kitchen had been proposed and retired gently because his mother had said on the phone, in the tone of someone directing traffic at a parade, that cameras would eat her curtains and she did not have new curtains to feed them. She would allow her hands, though, and a bowl, and what she called \u201cthe part of my forearm where you can see the life I have lived,\u201d and the sound op had said she could work with that and made a note that read hands/forearm/soup in block letters because sometimes you have to say exactly what you mean to the future.\n\nThey began at the diner because that was the kind of statement television liked\u2014place and person, smell of cinnamon pretending to be narrative, the visual generosity of glass cases. Gertie stood behind the counter with a posture she normally reserved for the mayor and people who attempted to bargain down the cost of lemon meringue. She had put on earrings that might have been small golden pies or, depending on your faith, suns. The crew did the introductions with the careful humility of people entering a kitchen they did not own. Tessa began to explain what they wanted and Gertie lifted a hand delicately, palm open like an air traffic instruction.\n\n\u201cYou will not put jaunty music over my pies,\u201d she said, with the crispness of a kitchen towel snapped into purpose. \u201cYou will not call me an institution as if I were a building that pretends to not crave repainting. You may ask me about butter and I will tell you truths you can live by, and you may ask me about men who think pie is a hobby and I will tell you a different set of truths that you may decide are unairable. You will eat and you will not put your fork down on the plate with the tines facing up because we are not animals.\u201d\n\nYasmin\u2019s mouth did the quick gymnastics of someone suppressing a laugh because she had learned to treat sound the way a librarian treats quiet. Tessa nodded, throat working, the way a person nods when they realize they\u2019ve been handed the manual for the equipment they have just plugged in without reading the manual. \u201cNo jaunty music,\u201d she said. \u201cNo institutions. Butter and men as subjects. Fork etiquette. Understood.\u201d\n\nNate watched the exchange with the pleasure of a man who had been asked to be useful and found the work being done for him by someone who had more glamorous verbs. He took Lionel to the back to show him where he could get a shot of the ovens without also getting a shot of the mop bucket, because documentary truth did not require audiences to know the color of the mop water. He taped down cables with the gentle roughly of someone who had spent a winter falling over the wrong things, and he moved one of the suppler power bars off a circuit that also powered the ice cream freezer, because a scoop\u2019s noble work need not be imperiled by television.\n\nThey chased light that day like responsible thieves. Tessa wanted a shot of the river path and the warming huts, those small pieces of art that appeared on the ice each year like confidence. The trail had turned into a memory with a half-life and the signs had gone up advising people who weren\u2019t from here to be their best selves and stay off. Nate made a call to a friend of Raj\u2019s who worked with the festival that brought the huts and secured permission to film one dragged up on land, tilted like a question. They loaded pies like relics and staged an argument between pies and weather, and it looked better on screen than anyone expected, which is how this city rewarded persistence: not with drama, but with a kind of crooked cooperativeness.\n\nAt the rink, the caretaker smiled like a man evaluating suitors and pointed at the paper sign about slapshots, which someone had fortified with glitter and conviction. Parents had been warned; forms had been printed and actual pens had been found. Children skated as if they were being filmed by a kind god and then forgot the camera existed and became their knees again. The crew wanted a sequence of the lights coming on, the way rooms change when illumination remembers itself, and Nate told them he would not fake the flicker. He would not stand people in a fabricated darkness so that their joy could be manufactured. He asked the caretaker to hit the switch at the natural hour and they waited in the seam time between gray and blaze, breathing into their mitts. When the lights came, three and one and then the rest in their obedient train, the rink made a kind of sound that didn\u2019t need microphones. Yasmin checked her levels anyway and Lionel grinned through his viewfinder as if he\u2019d been given permission to keep the contentment.\n\nThere were moments when the show tried to be a show and the city tried to be a city and Nate had to wedge himself between the two to make introductions more polite. At Union Station, the production wanted a shot of him in profile under the arch, looking like a man cultivates myth in his spare time. There was no train that hour, only a maintenance crew with carts and common sense, and someone suggested the Railway Museum as a stand-in with better angles. He shook his head because the performative image of a man with a ticket and an expression would not be truer for being prettier. He pointed out, instead, a small corner by the coffee kiosk where the sun shot a ribbon across the floor at ten thirty and made anyone who walked through it look like a lead in a movie about decency. They filmed him there, buying a coffee and not spilling it, nodding to the kind woman who tucked his change with the grace of practice into a dish, and the clip would later make people write to the show and say that they had, themselves, been there at ten thirty on a Wednesday and had felt better for it, and could they buy that feeling somewhere.\n\nHis mother agreed to hands, and to forearm, and to a bowl that had cracked and been mended, and the camera loved her the way cameras love people who do not ask to be looked at. She wore an apron with a pattern of cherries that had seen more grease than church, and she let flour be flour and not a symbol. Elastic dough flopped with the sound of a thing willing to be worked, and her voice, when it came as an invitation to the ear and not the eye, made even the clipboard-pen keepers stand still. She told a story about learning to say the word for stove in English and saying store by mistake and ending up with a bag that smelled like rubber and choices. Tessa asked permission, quietly, to use her line about media being a mirror that distorts because it is a mirror, and his mother said she could use it if she also added that sometimes mirrors are for checking if your teeth have parsley in them and this is a kindness. They laughed, and Lionel\u2019s camera made gentle confessions about where it liked to stand.\n\nThere was one moment\u2014the fight had to arrive somewhere\u2014when someone from production, an assistant to a person who had not come to Winnipeg because they were guarding a spreadsheet in Toronto, sent notes that suggested they stage a scene of winter hardship by frosting an exterior window and having Nate scrape it in a way that aligned with a sentimental narrative about ruggedness. \u201cWe can blow snow,\u201d Tessa said, apologetic already, holding up her phone with the email on it like a curse she had not sworn. \u201cWe can suggest marrow-stiffening adversity. They want grit. Grit sells.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have grit,\u201d he said, and did not mean the show kind. \u201cBut frost is not a metaphor until you\u2019ve watched your own breath hang in a hallway because the furnace fan died and you have five minutes to decide whether to learn or to call. We have perfectly serviceable adversity. We don\u2019t need to counterfeit it. Let me show you a lever that sticks unless you talk to it right. Let me introduce you to the sound the ice makes when it\u2019s lying about its integrity. Let me tell your camera to wait with us at a bus stop when the sign says fifteen minutes and the wind says thirty. Or we can point the lens at a bowl of soup and admit that heat is a kind of miracle.\u201d\n\nYasmin nodded the way people nod when an argument sets itself down with its weight where it belongs. Tessa put her phone back in her coat and changed the plan by not writing the change down. The fake frost did not happen. They recorded his hands on a real lever and the lever, flattered by the attention, behaved, and the part of the audience that had grown up in houses with levers wrote later to say thank you for not telling lies about their childhoods.\n\nThe only real crisis of the week had a smell\u2014ozone and anxiety. At the Blue Goose on Friday, halfway through a setup for a shot that would involve pie cooling on a sill like a fairy tale that had decided to be practical, a circuit popped somewhere in the subtle geometry of the building and half the front room\u2019s lights narrowed themselves for a debate about whether illumination should be optional. The coffee machine made a sound like a polite cough that refuses to escalate to a scene. Lionel looked up at the ceiling with the instinct of a man who had forgotten his luck was dependent on electrons. Gertie put her hands on her hips as if rearranging them might rearrange modernity. The show\u2019s gaffer, who was there to wrangle light in an elevated sense and not to negotiate with a caf\u00e9\u2019s secret temper, peered into a junction box with the brave disinterest of someone smelling another trade\u2019s territory.\n\nNate had already moved. He crouched behind the counter with the familiarity of a cousin who knows where the holiday cutlery is kept and popped the panel to see that a breaker had done its job and that the job had been discouraging. He chased the line with his eyes and then with his hands, skirting the capacious talent Gertie\u2019s cappuccino machine had for drama, and found the offender\u2014an outlet frame that had been tightened one corner at a time, seduced into a short by someone who meant well in a century that did not belong to them. He loosened, reseated, tightened in order, soothing the metal with the patience of a man who had learned that speed was a trickster. The lights returned without pomp, and the coffee machine made a noise like gratitude converting itself into crema.\n\nLionel\u2019s camera had caught the moment they didn\u2019t know to stage: knees on old tile, hands competent without needing to be performed as such, the spontaneous chorus of a room that had not been left in the dark. Later, when Tessa asked him if they could use it as a metaphor, he made a face that was not entirely kind and then nodded because it was also true. He extracted a quiet promise that they would balance it with shots that insisted women\u2019s hands and old tools and the kid at the dish pit also held up the day, and she agreed without giving him a speech about story arcs because she was a person who wanted to be invited to good dinners.\n\nIt was not all crisis avoidance and ethical wrangling. There were the small pleasures that make collaboration feel like a picnic instead of a committee\u2014Courtney learning to order a coffee in a blend of French and boldness in St. Boniface and the barista giving her an extra biscuit because she used merci like a kiss; Lionel showing a teenager how to hold a camera without letting it hold him; Yasmin taping a tiny microphone into Gertie\u2019s sleeve with the gentle efficiency of a nurse convinced of your recovery. There was Raj rolling through in a sweater the color of moral persuasion with baked samosas for the crew and a story about a client who had stored heirloom tomatoes in a filing cabinet. There was Mrs. Banerjee pausing on her walk past the Goose to inform the production that their van was parked as if reconsidering the right to be a van, and the piece of equipment was moved without anyone needing to say words like zone or City of Winnipeg in a tone.\n\nThey filmed a slice of her forearm and a teaspoon hitting the side of a cup and a bell over the door making a small decision to be charming. They filmed at the rink and used the sound of skates to transition between scenes instead of a jingle, and the editor in Toronto would later call Drew and say, surprised, that ice had rhythm. They filmed Nate at his van, heater wheezing nobly, drawers opened to reveal the OCD of a man whose peace involved labeling, and Tessa laughed out loud and told him to stop apologizing with his eyebrows for being neat. He apologized anyway and then stopped, chastened into practice.\n\nOn the last day, weather remembered it had power and brought a thaw that turned intersections into hypotheses. The plan had been to catch the golden hour by the river, camera low, wheat sheaf on his bib from Toronto lent to him again by the Agricultural Society because they believed in second uses. The river, pale and deceptive, sounded like a bar where someone had brought in a musician without telling the regulars. The crew wanted the shot of his city being itself and his feet moving through it in a way that would rhyme with the footage of him in Toronto in his hotel room holding a ribbon like a small absurdity. The ice dared them to be fools. He was not in the mood for foolishness that hurt, only for foolishness that healed, so he led them under the canopy by the market where the wind was banned by consensus and stood there instead, watching people move in bundles and pairs, carrying bread and hockey sticks and the afternoon inside their coats.\n\n\u201cTalk,\u201d Tessa said, softly, as if asking him to tell a story to a kid already asleep but faking it because they wanted more. \u201cTalk about what you would like us to take home from here.\u201d\n\nHe could have spoken about the ease of order, about his binding love of strip, twist, cap, about the way a switch that clicks with authority feels like a promise kept. He could have mentioned foxes and napkins and ladders in snack bars, and he almost did. What came out, instead, was something simpler, the way words are simpler when you realize you\u2019re not auditioning for anything.\n\n\u201cI want you to take home the fact that joy happens in dumb places,\u201d he said. \u201cIn rinks where dads argue about oatmeal cookies and a breaker decides to be dramatic and someone says no to a staged frost because we already have the weather we need. I want you to know that when people here appear understated it\u2019s sometimes a choice and sometimes it\u2019s the wind. I want you to film our hands and not just our faces. And if someone at a table tells you a story about butter, you need to listen because they are not talking about butter.\u201d\n\nLionel lowered the camera slightly and then raised it again because cameras are as susceptible to embarrassment as people are. Yasmin shifted her feet on the concrete to warm her toes and nodded just enough to say go on. He did, but only until the words finished, which they did of their own accord, like a good piece of electrical tape running out at exactly the right point on a wrap.\n\nBy the time they packed the last cable, the city had turned down its day and put on a coat of evening that made everyone look like a better version of themselves for just long enough to remember they could be. The crew went back to their hotel to argue gently over footage while eating something with a price that could be justified to a boss, and Nate walked to the Goose because he wanted to see if the day had left any crumbs behind. Gertie gave him a slice of pie without ceremony and a look like a confession you never have to pay for. He ate seated on the stool at the end like a man who had decided to be present for his own life and was seeing if it would allow him.\n\nOn his way home, his phone buzzed with a text from Moira. It was a picture of a mint on a saucer next to a folded program from a funeral, and her message was a handful of words without fat. Gran went gentle. Peppermint for ballast. He stopped and leaned against a mailbox the color of uncompromising and wrote back what he knew how to say\u2014how her braid had done good work in a room that was too loud and how ladders had been held for him and how he would think of her grandmother when he taught anyone to breathe through a moment that wanted you to do anything but. She wrote a heart, which felt insufficient and perfect, and he put his phone in his pocket.\n\nWhen he turned the corner onto his street, Mrs. Banerjee was out with the dog, who was wearing a new sweater that declared in block letters I HAVE OPINIONS. She lifted her mitten in salute, and he lifted his chin in return, and it was a rite conducted in the decent light of a day that had offered itself and been accepted. He oil-can\u2019d the van door once for the pleasure of proving to her he had listened and the hinge agreed with him. Upstairs, his kitchen had the quiet of a friend who had done the dishes while you were out and wanted you to notice without making a fuss. On the dresser, the ribbon sat with the voucher, a still life of possible directions.\n\nHe made tea in the good mug because he wanted to send himself a message about value. He sat at the table and flipped open his book to where he kept the unglamorous invoices and the glamorous doodles he made during hold music. He drew a ladder and then a pie and then a little cartoon light, and then he wrote at the top of a page: Fixers and Bakers, and underlined it, a cheap ambition made already better by ink. He drew boxes for dates and names, spaces for kids from Raj\u2019s art programs and teens Gertie had inevitably charmed and the boy at the counter who had changed his mind about silly things. He thought about the rink and a lying light and a Saskatchewan fox that had agreed to be seen, about trains and the way time lengthens when you\u2019re kind to it. He thought about Churchill and the north and how his voucher might be a sentence waiting for its verb, and he knew he didn\u2019t have to know yet. He could let that be a window he would open when the air itself asked.\n\nBefore bed, he called his mother to tell her that the crew had been kind and that the curtains remained unfed, and she hummed and asked whether the director had worn boots or only thought about boots and whether the world had stopped being impressed by his neat truck. He answered her in enough detail to let her picture his day and not so much that she would worry about the ice. He lay down and felt the city breathe around him, a big lunged animal that was happy to share oxygen. He let sleep arrive the way it arrives when you have not fought it\u2014without bargains, without apology. Outside, on the boulevard, the snow made one last attempt at sparkle and then gave up on theatrics, content to be ordinary under streetlight. In the morning, he would take his ladder to a house with baseboards that dreamed of being younger and he would flip a switch and something would yield to the idea of light, and that would be enough, and when he had time he would build a room where kids could learn how to breathe and to fix and to never be stingy with joy.Chapter 10\n\nThe episode aired on a Thursday that could not decide whether to be winter\u2019s encore or spring\u2019s rehearsal. The day spent itself on indecision\u2014sun that arrived with apology and left with flourish, a wind that tried on three accents before settling on the one that made noses sting. The Blue Goose had announced a watch-along with the matter-of-fact bravado of a place that had survived weddings, wakes, and a brief experiment with gluten-free puff pastry that Gertie insisted had been necessary for science. She taped a handwritten note to the door\u2014TELEVISION TONIGHT, NO JAUNTY MUSIC PERMITTED\u2014and set out bowls of peanuts as if preparing the diner for the weight of a city\u2019s attention.\n\nHe finished a job in a house where the baseboards wanted to be younger and the owners wanted dimmers that performed mood without melodrama, and he got to the Goose early because punctuality had revealed itself to him as a form of devotion. The place filled with the slow confidence of regulars plus cousins plus people who had only ever waved in and now found a reason to sit. You could tell the shy from the curious by the way they looked at the TV. The shy looked at the frame. The curious looked at the corners as if to catch the room off guard and thus more honest. Raj arrived with a bag of samosas he had no business calling a contribution and took up a post near the coffee urn as if caffeine required shepherding. Mrs. Banerjee occupied her usual stool with the air of a magistrate conducting an open hearing, the dog at home because crowds turned him into a critic.\n\nThe episode began in the modest way TV sometimes remembers to be modest. A train\u2019s window, a snow-bent field, a voiceover that didn\u2019t try to seduce anyone. There was Lionel\u2019s shot of the rink lights finding their courage, and the crowd in the Goose cheered lightly for their own children and then more loudly for their own light, and the sound hit Nate right at the sternum where his better decisions lived. Gertie appeared on screen with earrings like promises and laid out her commandments without committee. In the diner, men who had played hockey with her brother forty years ago slapped the counter and said there she is like a hymn. His mother\u2019s hands came next, the forearm with its good history, the bowl that had been mended and had decided not to be shy about it, and a silence arrived\u2014one you could taste, respectful and hungry\u2014and when her voice broke for one sentence and recovered it, the room breathed together, a lung of people who had been raised by women with aprons and opinions.\n\nHe felt the suspense that comes, for only a second, when you are about to see your own face unmediated. He had the impulse to duck behind a pie display and let the room see him in their periphery while he counted bolts of fear. He did not move. He watched himself dodge the camera\u2019s worst habits by standing near a coffee kiosk at ten thirty and doing what he always did, which was to be polite and take exact change and say thank you to something that spent itself on you without expecting praise. He saw his hands on the Goose\u2019s panel when the breaker had done its duty and needed to be told to do it again, and he saw the expression on his own mouth that meant focus and not performance, and he recognized the tilt of his head that had belonged to him since childhood when screws and sorrow had required equal torque.\n\nThe show did what it promised\u2014it made room, it did not sneer, it treated the city\u2019s rooms as if they were not backdrops but participants. There was a moment with the warming hut dragged onto land, a pie on a table in the wind, Tessa\u2019s voice absent in favor of the sound the river made promising to get on with it already, and in the Goose there was the particular sniffing sound men make when they will not admit to crying because their eyes have simply chosen this moment to be weather stations. At the end, Lionel\u2019s lens had lingered on a hand on a shoulder\u2014Drew\u2019s, not dramatic, not claiming ownership\u2014just weight shared. The screen went to credits and then to a commercial for insurance that had the gall to make a joke, and the diner finally did what it had been holding in reserve. It erupted, not in a roar but in the sort of chatter that means everyone has been waiting to be generous and now can be. People clapped for each other in the laconic prairie manner that still counts as rapture.\n\nGertie did not bow, on principle, but she looked at him over the counter and let her smile run without a leash. \u201cAcceptable,\u201d she said, and slid him a slice of pie with no desire to be coy. \u201cNo jaunty music.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won,\u201d he said, because accuracy is a kindness.\n\n\u201cWe all did, except the man at the network who suggested frost machines,\u201d she replied, and wiped her hands as if that could erase an entire genre of television thoughtlessness. \u201cHe will live a long and joyless life, his coffee always slightly wrong.\u201d\n\nPeople came to his elbow and told him tiny stories about their own trains, about their own lights, about their own hands. A woman from the school board somewhere in the river of conversation said, \u201cWe saw the bit at the end where you talked about kids and breathing and ladders. If you need space for a Saturday, we have a gym where the light switches have been pinned back from the eighties and a janitor who will look the other way if he\u2019s invited to judge pie.\u201d She handed him a card that had an actual phone number printed on it and a name underlined with someone\u2019s exasperation. He put it in his pocket in the way you put a spare key in your sock.\n\nHe got outside before the compliments turned into a stew he could not digest. The air did him the favor of being honest. Raj followed with the last samosa wrapped in a napkin as if it were a rare bird, and they stood on the sidewalk watching the city do its after-dinner rearrangements. \u201cThey loved you,\u201d Raj said, smug on behalf of a plan that had birthed itself into a life. \u201cThey loved the forearm more.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey should,\u201d he said. \u201cI am still auditioning for my role. The forearm has tenure.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re starting this thing,\u201d Raj said, blunt because friendship is a hammer when required. \u201cYou are going to call it what you wrote down and it will not be a secret from me that you are terrified. I\u2019ve lined up a notary and a woman named Flor who says the words \u2018small grant\u2019 the way choir directors say \u2018one more time, but with feeling.\u2019 Your job is to show up with screws and breath and the morally correct triangle of strip, twist, cap.\u201d\n\nThe first session of Fixers and Bakers did not so much begin as gather around itself, like dough deciding whether or not to rise based on the oven\u2019s attitude. The borrowed gym wore its echoes like a uniform. He and Raj arrived early because tables needed dragging and outlets needed negotiating, and someone had to put masking tape arrows on the floor because children require a geography even when they have no intention of obeying it. Gertie came in backward through the side door carrying two sheet pans that made the hallway smell like sincerity. She had brought hand pies the size of apologies and a stack of paper plates recycled from a church basement. Two high schoolers from Raj\u2019s art program arrived with a box of donated screwdrivers, each tagged with a ribbon as if to prove to the tools that they had been acquired in joy. The Agricultural Society\u2019s man appeared with a thermos that could have heated a church and the amount of apple cider that made people confess.\n\nThe kids came the way kids always come\u2014in erratic clumps, carrying grudges and hopes, dragged by aunties or followed by older brothers who would pretend boredom for three entire minutes before wanting a turn. There was the boy from the Goose who had discovered publicly that he could cry at a silly thing, chin forward now like a pilot\u2019s, and there was a girl whose hair made a case for static electricity as a personality trait. A mom with the calm of those who have negotiated with toddlers brought her son who wore soundproof headphones like a crown and whose eyes went to the ladder as if to name it family. He had required waivers printed and signed because the world asked you to avoid drama where possible, and he had fretted about the word being the enemy of joy, but the structure turned out to be a friend. Mrs. Banerjee arrived late, a stack of peppermints in her pocket, and declared herself a safety inspector with an assistant\u2014her dog\u2014whose sweater that day read SMALL BUT PUBLIC.\n\nHe began with breath because breath would serve them when everything else jangled. He made them stand with feet ready and hands on their own ribs and he told a story that contained no moral because the point was practice. Then he showed them a switch plate and the insides behind and laid out the words of his lullaby. Strip, twist, cap. He said it twice, soft as bedtime, and the room gave him the gift of quiet. Gertie demonstrated the parallel in dough\u2014cut, crimp, vent\u2014and winked at him as if they had planned it, which they had not, because some things are pre-arranged by the part of the universe in charge of parallels.\n\nThey split the kids into groups even though groups made him itchy. It had to be done because otherwise the smallest elbows would find the worst sockets. He took the older ones, the ones with the swagger that required a tool to settle it, and gave them a dead lamp and a box of wire nuts and asked them to bring it back from the border. Raj took the younger ones and taught them how to hold a screwdriver without letting the screwdriver hold them, and he spoke in metaphors that did not apologize for being metaphors. Gertie set the hand pies out with the severity of portion control and then undid all her own rules when a child\u2019s eyes told a more persuasive story about hunger.\n\nThere was a moment he had not expected and now would not have traded for a year\u2019s worth of ribbons. A girl with sleeves long enough to hide in had been hovering with that particular studied indifference that hides terror. She held her screwdriver as if it were a snake a magician had made polite. When he came to her table, she did not look up because eyes were traitors, but her hands told a better story. He showed her how to twist with the steadiness that convinces wire it is not being punished, and she followed, and when the two copper ends married under her fingers she made a sound that was not the delighted squeal television asks of girls but a short, grave exhale. He wanted to bow to her competence. He did not. He said, calmly, \u201cYou did that,\u201d and she said, as if reporting to an internal tribunal, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThey had been going an hour when the gym did the thing buildings do around the ninety-minute mark of children\u2014the lights hiccuped once in solidarity. It was not a crisis, more of a throat clear. The janitor, a man of jokes disguised as frowns, ambled over to the panel and made the gesture people make when they want to help but have learned that touching often makes the situation into more of itself. Nate went with him, because being helpful without owning the room is a skill he was finally proud to have acquired. The breakers were labeled admirably by someone who wrote as if labels prevented chaos in all domains. One was loose in its seat, an old friend he recognized. He reseated it with the pressure that says I mean it and not I dare you, and the room decided to keep being a room.\n\nNose-smudged cups traveled through the hour, laughter did the honorable labor of making time quick, and the dog, who disliked the echo of gymnasium acoustics on principle, settled under the table with his sweater proclaiming his smallness as a form of protest. Moira appeared on the phone via Raj\u2019s projector like a saint on a stained-glass window, her screen frozen into humor and then resolving. She waved her peppermint at the camera in solemn greeting and taught them an unreasonably useful trick for keeping crust edge from shrinking back on itself, and somewhere in the back the janitor, thinking he was out of range of education, tilted his head and listened as if pie lore were a trade secret he could translate into mopping. \u00c9lodie sent a video that played sideways because the universe makes a point of reminding us amateurs are still powerful, and in it she was ankle-deep in slush outside a community center in Rouyn-Noranda, declaring pie club a success because teens had arrived and nobody had set fire to anything except sugar on purpose.\n\nAfter the cider and the goodbyes and a ritual argument about whether there should be homework\u2014no, unless homework came in the form of breathing\u2014after the janitor had admitted with a gallantry that nearly killed him that the room had not been made worse by this intrusion, after Gertie had tucked three hand pies into a napkin and forced it into the coat of the shy girl \u201cfor your mother or for yourself depending on guilt,\u201d after Raj had listed at least six ideas that required both money and a belief in spare hours he did not have, after all that, he stood in the empty gym with a broom, sweeping confetti of wire clippings and paper plate shrapnel into a pile that looked briefly like an emblem of something he could not name. He loved a broom for its honesty. You ask it for order and it gives you little neat hills of evidence.\n\nOutside, late afternoon had flattened into that Winnipeg gray that makes you honest with yourself by removing all flattery. He had two hours until a call from Flor to confirm something about municipal insurance that had the word indemnify in it and made him itch in parts of his body paperwork rarely reached. He took the long way back toward his van because long ways tame adrenaline. Past the park where the snow had worn itself thin and the garbage cans were making unreasonable requests of passersby. Past a garage whose door was open to reveal a man tenderly repainting a bicycle as if it were a shrine. Past the kid\u2019s fort, the pizza-box sign updated for the season\u2014NO DOGS WHO BARK AT FORTS AND NO ADULTS WHO THINK RULES ARE SUGGESTIONS\u2014and he saluted it in his head because he had finally become the adult who did not think rules were suggestions except in cases involving kind shortcuts.\n\nHe still needed a space. A place that belonged to the thing, not borrowed in good will and kindly janitorial anxiety. He had been circling a vacancy listing for weeks, a former print shop just off Portage that had been empty long enough to lower its price and its pride. He had talked himself out of it four times and then back in three. Today the version of himself that believed in commitment was in charge. He drove over and parked, looked at the brick with its winter scabs, at the windows that had long ago surrendered to decals promising rush jobs and wedding invitations. The door stuck at the bottom like it had lost faith in coming and going as a model. Inside, the air had the stale optimism of spaces that remember machines. Dust lay on everything with the entitlement of poor landlords.\n\nIt was perfect the way damaged things are perfect when they can be repaired. Room enough for tables, a back corner that could be roped off for the ladder and the tools that wanted to be behind a line. An alcove that could hold a secondhand oven if the fire marshal could be seduced by paperwork and proof of adult behavior. He could see the sign above the front window in his mind\u2014FIXERS AND BAKERS\u2014painted without whimsy because the world would supply plenty. He could picture kids arguing about the ethics of pre-slicing electricity. He could hear Gertie bossing a borrowed oven into giving up flake. He could imagine Mrs. Banerjee setting up a folding chair like a bailiff and pronouncing on safety while her dog petitioned for and received a role as morale officer.\n\nThe landlord was a man whose cardigan had seen meetings and his eyes had seen late rents without each sighting turning him into a cynic. He walked the space with him with a kind of paternal curiosity. \u201cIt was a good print shop,\u201d he said, palm flat on the counter as if feeling the echo of receipts being signed. \u201cThen the world moved that work into computers and into rooms that did not smell like ink. What are you going to put here that will make it smell brave again.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren and sugar,\u201d he said, without thinking he was being clever. \u201cAlso, copper and old wood and a little fear managed into usefulness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city worries about you cutting fingers off the future,\u201d the landlord said, and there it was again, waiver, responsibility, the institutional vocabulary that had chased joy through gymnasiums since the advent of gymnasiums. \u201cWe can put things into papers so that everyone has their elbows in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like elbows in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will put it all into papers and we will put sticky notes on the papers to remind ourselves where we promised to be careful.\u201d He looked at the rent number, felt his stomach do the practical math that had folded him into refusal before, and felt instead, to his surprise, a steadiness. He had the small grant Flor had convinced into being with the authority of someone who treated narratives like budget line items. He had the Agricultural Society\u2019s ongoing mischief. He had a voucher in his desk for a train and he could cash that one way or another into a fundraising story and an event called Pie and Rails in which people would pay to hear Jacques by proxy. He had work that paid his rent and the kind of reputation that meant work would continue. He had a community that had trained him to ask without begging. He put his hand on the counter where paper had once been cut and leaned into the small joy of deciding.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and let the word ring in the room where no words had recently settled. \u201cOkay. We\u2019ll be careful. We\u2019ll be brave but documented. We\u2019ll do it for three months and check if the light flickers.\u201d\n\nThe cardigan man smiled and pulled a lease from a folder like a magician aware of his own clich\u00e9s. They sat on upturned crates because chairs would come later, and the pen he offered was one of those freebies from a tradeshow that wrote more stubbornly if you coaxed. He initialed so many places it became a music. He signed where names ask to be themselves. He thought of the vocabulary of commitment\u2014terms, consideration, delivery\u2014and marveled that his body did not rebel at the words. The landlord shook his hand with the grip of a man whose grandfather had shaken hands even when it snowed, and then left him alone in a space that was now, in the small ways that matter, his.\n\nHe paced the perimeter as if a careful dance could turn square footage into something friendlier. He found the light switch and tried it, as you do when you acquire something that claims it can glow. Only two of the fixtures woke, and they did so grudgingly, and he laughed out loud because of course. He fetched his screwdriver because he had brought one without permitting himself to acknowledge that he had brought one, and he popped a lens and did the first repair in a place that would teach repairs. It was small and honest, and when the light steadied it painted the dust into a hundred clear stories.\n\nOn his way home he detoured by his mother\u2019s because good news behaved like a dog in him and tugged. She opened the door with a dish towel in her hand because of course she was in the middle of something that smelled like onions and authority. He told her the rent number and the square footage and the fact that he had just agreed to a relationship with a mop. She made a face as if considering him for promotion and nodded once. \u201cI will bring a plant that refuses to die,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, I will bring young onions in a jar because children must learn that cutting something sharp can be safe if you hold it correctly.\u201d\n\nShe handed him a jar as if to make good on the promise in advance, and he hugged her because the day had asked him to carry a great deal of brave, and a hug is a form of unloading you do not have to apologize for. On his way out, she leaned out the door as she always did, the evening drafting her voice like an accomplice. \u201cNathan,\u201d she said, and it was the tone she used when she wanted his attention to be a cathedral. \u201cTeach them to breathe first. Everything else is dessert.\u201d\n\nHe slept that night the way he slept when the day had made official some private thought. He dreamed of tables arriving in a truck that had already carried twenty piano recitals and a parade, and a sign being hand-lettered by a boy whose concentration could cut glass, and a landlord\u2019s cardigan draped over a chair after hours because sometimes people forget to take off their roles when they go home. In the morning, the city had iced its sidewalks lightly and then apologized with sun, and he let that be an omen and not a trap. He drove to a job where a woman had called because her porch light overshared its opinion of dusk, and he fixed it with compassion and a little tape and a lot of listening. He took a phone call from Flor while his hands were clean and agreed to a training session on the ethics of youth programs in public spaces because someone had to make sure his good intentions were not going to trip over liability in front of witnesses. He left a message for Moira with the address of the new place and the promise of a chair with her name on it if she ever came west. He texted \u00c9lodie a picture of the empty room with the caption: room for a thunderstorm hair guest residency, and she sent back ten lightning bolts and a heart.\n\nBy afternoon he was pulling up old vinyl in the shop and discovering beneath it a floor that had made arguments with generations of shoes and would, with persuasion, tell a better story. Raj arrived with a pry bar and enthusiasm and a speech about how he had once installed a gallery show in a room that detested art and had been converted by snacks. They worked until the light called them silly and they kept going anyway, and they talked in the way men talk when their bodies are busy\u2014bits and installments and sudden sincerity like pepper thrown over the shoulder. He told Raj about the moment the shy girl\u2019s hands had believed themselves, and Raj told him about a boy who had brought a sketchbook full of houses into his office and asked where the doors belonged if you wanted people to enjoy leaving and coming back.\n\nWhen the night finished them rather than the other way around, they sat on the counter in the half-lit room and drank water from mismatched mugs a neighbor had dropped off because the city does that when it senses an opening. In the dark of the window, their faces floated like benevolent signage. \u201cYou know what you did,\u201d Raj said, not really asking.\n\n\u201cSigned a lease on a counter I had no legal right to like that much,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou put a dome car in a building,\u201d Raj said. \u201cYou are going to make a place people can sit in and look up and feel small and safe and in motion, all at once.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to protest because the metaphor was too neat and therefore asking for gravity to argue with it. He let it stand because it was also not wrong. He could already hear inside the room the counting of chews at a table, the measured rhythm of twist, the peppermint breath, the laughter when someone admitted the word waiver made their skin itch, the quiet after solutions when people looked at each other with their full faces and not their corners. He could see ladders with hands on them that did not flinch. He could imagine Mrs. Banerjee\u2019s dog in a sweater that read FACILITIES, and he laughed at that, out loud and at length, because joy stored properly does not spoil.\n\nBefore he left he took a picture of the room as it was\u2014dust and half-light and the corners where plans collect\u2014and he sent it to his mother and to Gertie and to the Agricultural man and to Moira and \u00c9lodie and Ty and to Jacques at the email address Drew had extracted from the ether with polite persistence. He wrote no caption for most and only to Jacques did he add words\u2014room with motion but no wheels yet\u2014and within an hour a reply came in English with vowels round as trains. \u201cEvery good car starts with a bench,\u201d Jacques wrote. \u201cPut benches, then you will have passengers. Someone will bleed on a ticket. Keep napkins.\u201d\n\nHe went home humming a song he would have been embarrassed to sing, the city obligingly emptying a lane for his van as if it respected the end of a day. In bed, he lay and listened to the building\u2019s pipes tell their stories and thought of the word okay said to empty rooms, train platforms, long tables, and people. He thought of the voucher in the drawer and the north, waiting with foxes. He thought of a Saturday when children would breathe like mechanics and adults would learn where to put their hands when someone else was on the ladder. He let the day pledge itself to tomorrow without being made into a boast. The radiator ticked like a cricket with good manners, and he let sleep come in polite and stay as long as it wanted.",

                              "content": "In the morning Winnipeg light, pale and thin as skim milk, Nate Kowalsky rolled the van door shut with a hinge-creak that could be heard halfway down the block. The block was gray and still. Snow didn\u2019t fall so much as just refuse to melt, crudded up into dense berms and glazed spots, the gravel naked in patches where tires had chewed and chewed. He rubbed his gloved hands together, the leather stiff, cords and wire spools bumping his hip through the canvas of his work pants. His breath came out in little comic balloons. If he smiled he could turn them into speech bubbles in his imagination.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he called, more to prove he had a voice than to greet anyone in particular. But there was Mrs. Banerjee across the way, kneeling in her parka, coaxing the world\u2019s bravest little dog over a ridge of tire-packed snow. She lifted a glove, triumphant. The dog lifted a tiny paw and looked offended by the very idea of February.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be late,\u201d she said, as if this were a moral failing, the kind that a city would remember. \u201cThe roads.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the van is for,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got opinions about black ice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has bad opinions,\u201d Mrs. Banerjee said, and the dog sneezed, which seemed like civic confirmation.\n\nHe slid into the driver\u2019s seat, swung his Thermos into the cup holder, and exhaled the tightness that work mornings gave him. His chest felt like a cupboard crammed with extension cords. He turned the key and treated the engine to murmured encouragements reserved for old friends and sullen children. It caught. The radio came on to a weather report that might\u2019ve been a joke, except the people on the radio never sounded like they were joking. He turned it down. He wanted to hear the van; it had a way of confiding in him about its health.\n\nThe first job of the day was in Wolseley, a century-old house with corners that sagged like surrendered shoulders and baseboards that had seen boot heels, paws, and probably the patience of saints. The homeowner was a young couple with a baby that had a constitution like a French horn. They were converting an attic into a nursery as if proximity to the sky itself were a tonic. He had told them, kindly, that if they didn\u2019t insulate that place like a Thermos bottle they\u2019d be raising a Canadian snowman. They laughed and nodded, and he\u2019d known then that he\u2019d be back in six months to fix what cold air had taught them.\n\nHe parked under an elm coarse with frost crystals and hauled his tool bag out by the handles. There was coffee in the bag too\u2014Gertie\u2019s coffee from the Blue Goose Diner\u2014evidence of the detour he\u2019d made, not because he needed caffeine (he did) but because he\u2019d gone for pie. It wasn\u2019t rational, going for pie at 7 a.m., but rationality had never been the boss of cravings. From the Blue Goose he\u2019d emerged with a paper box warm enough to fog his glasses, cradling what Gertie called \u201cbreakfast pie,\u201d which was the same as all the other pies but with spunk. Apple and cheddar braided into a crust he\u2019d sworn once he\u2019d heard sing. He told people he ate pie for his health and for economy (calories per dollar, Gertie, I\u2019m doing the math) and sometimes they believed him.\n\n\u201cCome in quick, quick,\u201d called a voice when he knocked at the Wolseley door. He stamped his boots and did not come in quick; years of polite habit rounded off into muscle memory. He stepped into a carpet that felt like it had been poured. The baby honked. The couple looked like people who\u2019d survived a long winter of requests.\n\n\u201cYou want me to\u2014\u201d he gestured at the attic hatch, simple and sacrificial.\n\n\u201cIf you could just see where the lamp wires go,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThey\u2019re acting like a tiny haunted house up there.\u201d\n\nThe man added, like a pledge, \u201cWe turned everything off in the panel you told us to. Promise.\u201d\n\nHauntings, in his profession, were either rodents or bad splices. He pulled down the wooden ladder that had the slick of many hands on its rails, and climbed with the calm that came from knowing wood had been trusted by bigger, heavier men than him. The attic smell hit him\u2014dry and sweet, the brittle blueprint smell of old joists and sawdust and the ghost of wool blankets. Light coming through a dormer smeared itself across dust-motes and made even the insulation seem like it might be helpful. He set the lamp down, unscrewed it, and followed the wire as if following a river upstream to its foolish headwaters.\n\nHe worked without drama. There is nothing like the rhythm of solving small problems with your hands to keep grandiose thoughts at bay. Strip, twist, cap. Tug, tuck, secure. When the couple came up to see, he explained in simple terms and they nodded like people who were grateful their time was being given back to them.\n\n\u201cIt will buzz when the furnace kicks because of the old ductwork,\u201d he told them. \u201cBuzzing is a love language in houses like these.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t tell them the things he sometimes thought while he worked, about how inside of every wall was an improvisational theater piece starring nails and temptation. He went back to the van when he was done, scratched a note for his afternoon job in Transcona where the gentleman had a hobby of putting in his own outlets sidewise for reasons that amounted to how \u201che liked it better.\u201d\n\nAt the Blue Goose, earlier, Gertie had looked at him over the pie case like a judge that everyone rooted for despite themselves. Her hair was a snowy cloud arrangeable into no fewer than three landscapes; her wrists were wrapped in bracelets the color of grape jelly.\n\n\u201cYou missed the prelims, Nate,\u201d she had said, sliding the paper box toward him ceremoniously. \u201cI would scold you but I don\u2019t scold electrician-hands. Those hands\u2014see? Those hands keep my pastry case lit and the mixer that hates me alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a breaker box older than me with more secrets than me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt whispered. I listened. We hugged. It was fine.\u201d\n\nGertie had a way of asking questions without words. Her eyebrows had a vocabulary.\n\n\u201cYou could have been somebody,\u201d she said, theatrically tragic. \u201cYou know the Spring Thaw pie-off goes to regionals, and regionals sends one glorious local into the arms of the National Sweet. That\u2019s what they call it now. The National Sweet! Can you imagine?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can imagine sugar,\u201d he had said, because his role at the Blue Goose was sarcasm and awe, colour-coded to Gertie\u2019s approval. Then he\u2019d let it land, what she had said. A second behind his smile, you could always see him thinking. \u201cWait. I missed the prelims?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not,\u201d she said, relenting, the eyebrows smoothing into forgiveness. \u201cBut I like you better when you leap. It\u2019s this afternoon, three o\u2019clock, down at The Forks. They do it outdoors because they claim fresh air is character-building. As if sugar ever failed to build character.\u201d\n\nHe had looked at the calendar on his phone and at the words he had scribbled in his workbook and felt something tug inside his ribs. He told himself it was just hunger switching masks.\n\nHe\u2019d always liked watching competitions that made a show out of ordinary pleasures. You didn\u2019t need the aesthetics of athleticism to admire someone standing before an open question: how much, how fast, how joyous? Pie was the opposite of sleek. It slumped. It refused to be a quick story, held together by starch and stubbornness. Gertie made pies that refused to be shamed into neatness. They did not slice well and it felt like a personality trait.\n\nAt noon the light brightened in that winter way that only emphasizes how sun here is like cold fire, a flame you are not allowed to get too close to. He hit the job in Transcona as if he were tackling a cousin, and made quick work of reorienting outlets to appease both electrical code and a man\u2019s love of symmetry\u2019s distant cousin, preference. There was something gentle about restoring a thing to code, a tiny social contract, like reminding someone to call their mother. He collected his cheque, paper, folded twice, his name spelled right, a small perfection.\n\nOn the drive to The Forks he took his glove off at a long light just to press his fingers against the heating vent. The radio told him a story about a man who had lost a canoe in summer and found it in winter in someone else\u2019s yard. In Winnipeg, carbon-steel notions like ownership had a way of getting buffed by weather into the more interesting concept of neighbor.\n\nAt The Forks the river paths looked like poorly kept promises, shinier than you wanted them to be. He followed the signs for the festival, smack into stands selling Ukrainian flags and butter tarts and antler headbands because at some point while he lived ordinarily, someone had decided that antlers were now a noun you could wear for ironic clout. Winnipeg collects irony like an aunt collects teaspoons. You look at the city and think: surely there cannot be more. And then there is.\n\nA crowd had already gathered under the string lights that day refused to overpower. Nate recognized the official in charge\u2014Drew, who was an unofficial battery of every mid-level festival in the city, possessed of clipboard, beard, and a voice that could fling syllables into a crowd.\n\n\u201cLast call for hungry fools,\u201d Drew bellowed, smiling wide. \u201cGet your bibs. Bowl of water to the left, napkins to the right, dignity in a locker somewhere far away.\u201d\n\nGertie shouted when she saw him, such that strangers parted like a curtain. \u201cHe made it,\u201d she declared to no one and everyone. \u201cI am responsible for this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Nate said, but he was the one to step into the ring of tables like a man who had just remembered something that mattered to him. He had eaten pie competitively once in high school, in a gym that smelled like varnish and teenage effort. He\u2019d been shirtsleeves and bravery then. Now he was work jacket and longing.\n\nThe rules were simple. The pies were Saskatoon berry, blue as the bruises you\u2019d be bragging about later. No hands, forkless, face-first. You had eight minutes to do with your mouth what your hands would do better, and in this there was a lesson.\n\nHe found a place at the far end and tied the ridiculous plastic bib around his neck. A woman to his left, short and sharp-eyed, nodded at him like a colleague at a conference. To his right a boy in a toque too large looked both terrified and giddy.\n\n\u201cFirst time?\u201d Nate asked the boy.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the boy said, and then turned red. \u201cYes. I mean, I watch videos online.\u201d\n\n\u201cVideos never smelled like this,\u201d the woman said, and she was right. The air was thick with sugar and fruit and that bakery scent that was equal parts comfort and warning.\n\nWhen Drew blew the whistle it felt like someone had opened the starting gate on tiny, sweet horses. Nate bent and let himself go. In the first seconds there is always panic\u2014food, in this quantity, is a topographical feature. It isn\u2019t for tasting; it\u2019s for understanding. He understood Gertie\u2019s crust. He found the rhythm, like a man sanding a door in long, even strokes, and listened to his lungs. He knew when to breathe through his nose, shorties and then a long haul, when to let his tongue help, practical and relentless. He felt ridiculous, and then he stopped caring, which is the start of every good performance. He laughed at his own face, which must be a geographer\u2019s dream. For a brief minute, a minute that tasted like berries and regret, he was happy in the way that requires no permission.\n\nHe didn\u2019t win. The woman at his left had a technique that made his seem pastoral. She had some secret, possibly to do with how she enforced a mental calorie truce. The boy on his right flamed out quickly and sat back, daubing his cheeks with a napkin like an old man at a sink. Nate finished his pie, finished it entirely, which he set out to do as if closing a loop for a version of himself who wasn\u2019t allowed to waste, ever, as a child. That had been his mother\u2019s voice, the knuckles of it all sincerity and hard work. He lifted his head, laughing, aware of the purple streak he must now carry like a flag.\n\n\u201cFinalist positions will be posted this evening,\u201d Drew announced, after it all, when the contestants stood looking at themselves, the way you do when you\u2019ve done something both silly and sincere. \u201cIt\u2019s based on both speed and degree of clean. We are professionals.\u201d\n\nGertie had edged her way to the table with a stack of napkins anyway. Her bracelets clinked like tiny bells. \u201cYou,\u201d she said, meaning him entirely, \u201cwere a painting. You were art.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was blueberry slaughter,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the life you choose,\u201d she said, not unkindly, wiping a dot of juice from his ear as if she were his auntie and not the town\u2019s loudest oracle.\n\nHe went home in the dusk, of which there was plenty. Mrs. Banerjee\u2019s dog barked once, like an affidavit, and he waved. In his kitchen, he leaned against the counter and drank water like someone who had been out in the desert and found a public fountain. He took off his boots. The radio, later, said that a person was recommended to do a thing because the heart is better off at rooms where there are stories rather than at doors where there are none.\n\nHe checked his phone at 8 p.m., when Drew was likely to have collated the results, armed with a spreadsheet and a beer. His name was, to his surprise, third. Third is such a sweet spot. First is the target; second is okay if you hate bragging; third is an astonishment and therefore pure joy. The top three, the website said in letters that had clearly been decided upon during a committee that believed in excitement by font, would travel to Toronto for the National Sweet.\n\nHe read the line twice. The word travel glowed. He had been to Thunder Bay once as a kid, an adventure that had felt like an ocean voyage. He had flown to Vancouver exactly one time for a cousin\u2019s wedding, wearing a suit that had made him feel like a carefully constructed argument. He liked where he lived not because he couldn\u2019t imagine anywhere else but because he could and chose this anyway. But trains. Trains were a story he had told himself many times while driving, the winter\u2019s glittering track insistently parallel to the highway for a stretch out by Transcona, all that metal, those plans. He had always wanted to take the train east like a person who wanted to step into a history that did not include him. Like being allowed to hold somebody else\u2019s heirloom careful: look, don\u2019t break it.\n\nHe set the phone down and picked it up again. He texted someone and erased it. He walked around the table the way some people circle new cars, considering. He called his mother.\n\n\u201cMa,\u201d he said when she answered, the old house in St. Boniface singing its own high note on the line, as if the phone wires remembered voices in the tone of a minor key.\n\n\u201cNathan,\u201d she said, same as always, the Ukrainian in her voice like embroidery on a plain shirt. \u201cYour Uncle tells me you fixed his shaver.\u201d\n\n\u201cUncle Brodie fixed his shaver,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI told him not to shave when he\u2019s drowsy. I have news.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do not tell me you are engaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would that be something you do not wish?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I would then need to cook what your grandmother cooked, and my hands are not as young as my mouth.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. He could see her at the blinds, peeking, the street, her life reduced to a few square panes and a television that tried its best.\n\n\u201cI made a pie eating thing,\u201d he said. \u201cA contest. Do not make the sign of the cross, this is an honest story. I placed. I have to go to the big thing if I can, in Toronto.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you are calling me because I am from Ontario and therefore am responsible for trains,\u201d his mother said, sharp, amused. She had been seventeen when she left her Ontario town for the Prairies, with a suitcase that had been heavy not because of what was in it but because of what she thought she was leaving behind. She still said sorry in a way that made apologies sound like pastries\u2014unexpected, sugar-dusted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling you because I wanted to say it out loud,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought you might say something.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have said many things,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout hydration, about the sins of sugar. I will say the train from Winnipeg to Toronto is expensive like a fur coat and twice as warm if you choose to sit near the window. Your cousin went that way and did not stop talking about the way Jacques said the word \u2018dome\u2019 for days after he met that man from Quebec. People on the train tell you their life because they cannot get off and you cannot get off and in this way intimacy is inflicted. How much is the ticket.\u201d\n\nHe clicked and tapped. The website for Via Rail did that polite thing of pretending it had lots of options and then slowly declining most of them. He read the categories aloud. Economy. Upper. Sleeper. His mother hummed at the dollar amounts like a person unsure whether to take thirds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot,\u201d he said finally. \u201cAnd this is assuming I go without a bed and just\u2026arrange my body. Which it does not love.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cThe world charges for dreams like it charges for novelty t-shirts. For the printing and for the idea. You have money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have enough money for my new tires and for uncle\u2019s shaver and for a couch that doesn\u2019t slump in the middle, not theatrical dreams,\u201d he said. He said it lightly but he knew the numbers. He had a mind like a tidy junk drawer where, if you moved the elastic bands and twist-ties, there were facts too.\n\n\u201cMaybe they pay you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey pay you in applause and a commemorative bib.\u201d\n\n\u201cA family heirloom,\u201d she said, and he heard her smile. \u201cI will pray\u2014it\u2019s what I do\u2014for a sponsor. The world is full of people who love to give their name to other people\u2019s pie. And if not, then you will go another time. You will be sad, and then you will not be sad, and you will be happy in a way that isn\u2019t about the going.\u201d\n\nShe was like that. She had a way of pulling the thread of a thing until the knot said fine, fine, you\u2019re right. He didn\u2019t want to skip the sadness, though. He wanted to stand in both the wanting and the reality like a person who can hold two plates without dropping either and also acknowledge that he is not a juggler. He told her he loved her. She told him to wear his hat in that wind that came across the field like a rumor that had turned into a fist.\n\nAfter he hung up he sat silently. The fridge hummed. Somewhere below him someone sneezed; the building echoed it back politely. He had no spare money lodged anywhere obvious. Work had been steady but not extravagant, his habit of putting cash aside consistent and not miraculous. He had never learned the magic some people knew: summoning big money at a moment\u2019s notice. Bingo luck. Uncle money, lottery, mysterious envelope. The only thing he knew how to do was more of what he already did, and time was a pie you couldn\u2019t cut more of.\n\nHe came awake the next morning planning to not think about it, then thinking about it anyway, because the mind is a dog let out into the yard and it always goes to the same spot first. He had a job in a caf\u00e9 off Corydon where the owner wanted more black track lighting even though the ceiling was low enough to gossip with. He hauled the ladder in, nodded to the barista who looked like a photograph of a barista, and made a world of small black fixtures align like planets in a tiny galaxy. People sat under the future lights and ate scones, and their hair caught even the minimal morning light like it was a secret they\u2019d been hoping to keep. He thought about asking the caf\u00e9 woman if she would sponsor a sweet-toothed electrician and get her name on a bib. He did not ask. There is a fine line between audacity and theft, and he did not yet have the boots for it.\n\nAt lunch he parked by the river and climbed onto the little footbridge to watch the brown water move under its shell of ice. Winnipeg has two rivers and they move like a dispute, slowly, in public. The breeze cut his eyes. A skate-bladed couple glided past holding hands like a metaphor that refused to stay where it belonged. He took a picture of the sky because it was one of those days when it looked like it had been ironed by someone conscientious. He sent the picture to his friend Raj with the caption: people are moving on purpose.\n\nRaj sent back a series of dumpling emojis and then: drew told me u\u2019re in. what\u2019s the plan.\n\nHe typed: i halved the plan with the universe and it kept the half with the dollars. he added a shrug, and then felt childish, and then sent it anyway.\n\nThere was work to do: a panel to upgrade in a new-old house in St. James where a guy named Brad who had really wanted to be named Bradley insisted that the panel be flush with the wall because he hated \u201cbumpy things.\u201d Nate said it could be done but would be ugly; Brad hesitated at the ugly, and then made the right call, the good choice that men who want to be named something else often have hidden inside them. Nate unspooled cable like a fisherman and felt the tautness in his shoulders that sometimes made him think he was a part of the structure he was working on. He was in it; he might as well be in it.\n\nEvery spare moment, in the van, in line at the hardware store where he knew the price of outlets and the names of the people who bought them in bulk, he did math. Train fare. Food. A cheap place to sleep. He opened tabs that he then shut because looking at them hurt. The festival was a week away. There were emails now from the organizers with words like \u201cdelighted\u201d in them, words that were, against all logic, persuasive. There were small print details. He read them like a good boy. No assistance. No outside sponsorship unless approved. Waiver. The word waiver is never used for anything you would truly want to do; it\u2019s involved when someone somewhere thinks there\u2019s going to be fun and therefore probably risk. There was a line about \u201ctravel is the responsibility of the contestant.\u201d He marked it yellow, for emphasis he didn\u2019t need.\n\nAt the Blue Goose that week, Gertie made special pie with a heart cut in the top. She offered him a slice for free and he paid anyway. He told her about the trains.\n\n\u201cAh, the train,\u201d she said. \u201cI once took a train to Montreal and we shared a table with a man who had never learned to say the word \u2018oats\u2019 without sounding like he was confessing something. I had a bunk. I pretended that my bunk was a private cabin and my cabin was a small country. Every women deserves a tiny country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take a seat,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d make it a country anyway.\u201d\n\nShe considered. \u201cDo you have a girl,\u201d she said, and he laughed at how sudden she was.\n\n\u201cI have a mother and a van,\u201d he said, \u201cand a neighbor who scolds. Does that count.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have hands that can hold a wire without fear,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will not always be alone.\u201d It wasn\u2019t pity; it was prophecy, fixed with a fork.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t fear wire,\u201d he said. \u201cI fear invoices.\u201d\n\nIt took three more days for it to land in a way that felt like truth\u2014the no of the train. There wasn\u2019t a dramatic moment, no last-minute phone call, no denial of a loan or a cruel card decline at a gas pump. There was simply, on a Thursday evening, a mirror and his face in it, and he said out loud, \u201cI\u2019ll not go,\u201d and the face didn\u2019t flinch. He felt the no settle into the kitchen like a guest who understands how to keep his elbows in. He wrote the email to Drew, the man of clipboards, and chose words that weren\u2019t a scream even though his chest wanted one. He said: I\u2019m unable to make it to Toronto. Select someone who can. Congratulations to the others.\n\nThe send button was a small red thing. He pressed it as if he were a man turning off a light in an empty room. Then he went out, because the house seemed intent on telling him things he did not want to hear too loudly. He walked and let his boots mind their own business on the packed and glittering ruts. A kid down the block had built a snow fort and made a sign for it in marker on a pizza box. It read: no dogs and no adults who hate forts. He wanted to stand at the entrance and recite his credentials. He qualified, technically.\n\nHe found himself at The Forks again, in that way that you do when your feet know places they want to wander when your mind is busy. It was later, near close, the vendors beginning their slow and practiced rituals of tidying away. He walked past the ice sculptures where angles had been made to pretend they were delicate not for long. He sat on a bench and felt the cold come through it and into his bones, where he could breathe it out slowly. He might have stayed there until his anger turned into something else. Or he might have stood up and smashed the pie-stand cardboard cutout of a smiling berry with his boot. He did neither. He looked at his phone for no reason and then remembered that his hands were cold and put it away.\n\n\u201cHey.\u201d It was a voice that had always felt like a tap on the shoulder\u2014a little too much familiarity for the first moment. It was Raj, who had a way of being anywhere that felt like both a trick and a kindness.\n\n\u201cI told you I would regret it,\u201d Raj said, sitting beside him, using the plural you of best friends. \u201cBut I also told you I would not try to change your mind. Possibly I lied about that second part.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot be the guy who crowdfunds pie,\u201d Nate said. \u201cI mean. That sentence? That is a sentence that cannot be lived down in a city of this size.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to crowdfund,\u201d Raj said. \u201cYou need a patron. Sponsors. Someone who makes flour. Someone who makes forks.\u201d His mind was a market. He pressed his gloved hands to his knees and bounced his heels and then stopped, aware of the reading now in Nate\u2019s posture\u2014no bouncing.\n\n\u201cGertie,\u201d Raj said, because solutions have to be at least proposed. \u201cShe loves you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe loves dramatic speeches,\u201d Nate said. \u201cI am a man made of minor chords.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen a minor-chord man lets his friends set banners behind him while he continues to play minor chords until someone cries,\u201d Raj said. \u201cI know, yes, pride. I am messy. You are tidy. Let me make a case.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like we don\u2019t become who we are because of the kitchens we grew in,\u201d Nate said. \u201cMy mother taught me to take instead a smaller piece and to be grateful. Your mother taught you to reach bravely and apologize later with cookies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cookies were excellent,\u201d Raj said. \u201cThey solved crimes. They solved wars. Eat one and forgive me for wanting you to go to the thing you want to go to.\u201d\n\nNate breathed. It steamed. He thought about how the city looks from the train window: the yards and siding, the backs of houses, the undershirts of neighborhoods. He thought about how his life, small and neatly arrayed like a toolbox he liked to open and look at sometimes just to feel he was the kind of person who liked order, might make room for something sloppy.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and his own okay startled him. But he\u2019d only said okay to listening.\n\nRaj didn\u2019t crow. He relaxed his shoulders. \u201cThere are ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are rooms with people who want to put their big names on small brave things.\u201d\n\nHe did not say: my uncle knows a guy, because this was not that kind of favor. Instead he took out his phone and showed Nate a message he\u2019d already written to their friend Flor in communications with the community arts council. It was beautifully worded, a way to ask without it sounding like begging. It was not an ask, even, so much as an offering: a chance to be associated with a good story. Nate read it and something in him did not object.\n\nThe next day he went back to work in a small office in an old bank building, the vault now a copy room, the thrill of walking inside of it still new enough to be the good kind of childish. He cut conduit to length. He measured twice. Measured again. He let the day keep him honest. His phone buzzed late afternoon with a message from Drew anyway: sorry to hear it. if anything changes, the spot is yours.\n\nHe typed and erased three responses. He finally sent: thanks. if something changes you\u2019ll be the first to know besides my mother.\n\nHe went to the Blue Goose afterward without knowing he was going there until he was there, his boots already at the mat. Gertie pointed at him with a knife, then realized what she was doing, and made it into theater, which is to say she flourished. \u201cHero,\u201d she said, like a threat. He could see she\u2019d heard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a tragedy,\u201d he said quickly. He didn\u2019t want to see it reflected back at him that way. He had a dislike of melodrama unless it was clearly labeled. \u201cIt\u2019s an ordinary no.\u201d\n\nShe reached for a paper plate, set it on the counter. She did not put pie on it because she was not an insult comic. \u201cSome ordinary nos hold up the world,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are ninety-eight you\u2019ll speak with fondness of the day you didn\u2019t go to Toronto because of stubbornness and money.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t know whether she was gently scolding or gently teasing so he gave her the sincerity he had. \u201cI wanted to go,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I wanted to say it. Out loud. To someone who\u2019d hold it steady and not turn it into a lesson or sad song. To just say it, and let it be real and not be the end of anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a pie for that,\u201d she said. \u201cI put thyme and lemon in it for people who insist on complicated feelings.\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cYou making that up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the back,\u201d she said, and then went to the back because sometimes a person tells you where they\u2019re going because the idea of surprise is not kind.\n\nHe sat on the stool at the end of the counter where he had sat many times and looked out at his city through the glass, where the shapes of people in coats are mostly identical and the only way you know someone is by how they move. Winnipeg had a way of making you small and then rewarding your faithfulness if you stayed small. He loved it. He resented it a little. He loved it again. When Gertie came back with pie that smelled like a garden had agreed to have tea, he felt the little sigh his heart made when a thing was right.\n\n\u201cEat your complicated feelings,\u201d she said. \u201cThen come to the back because a man from the Winnipeg Agricultural Society is paying me for pie and this may be a coincidence or an omen.\u201d\n\nHe forked thyme and understood, in that moment, that happy was not a place he would arrive at with flags. It was something to be located inside a day like this: heavy boots, a ladder, a laugh at the right time, a no that you can say and survive, a pie with thyme in it just because someone thought you might need to chew on the idea.\n\nThe man from the society wore a suit of the sort that makes a person look as if he has somewhere else to be and the decency to pretend he does not. He had a grin like a row of dominoes, straight, ready to run. He loved Gertie because all the sensible people did.\n\n\u201cI heard about your boy,\u201d he said to her, indicating Nate with a skim of his chin. \u201cNot all our heroes are hockey.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Gertie said. \u201cSome of us are pastry.\u201d\n\nThe man grinned. \u201cWe have some community funds for travel for silly reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I will not pretend we\u2019re building a hospital. But we fund the quilt-makers and the square dancers and the man who makes tiny ships in bottles and then breaks the bottles on purpose in a performance art thing I frankly do not understand. We make room for joy. We\u2019d like to help him go to Toronto. I called the council. They told me they\u2019d already heard from a Raj. We all apparently want to be part of this.\u201d\n\nThe thrill that rose in Nate had to be tamed; he had practice. He folded his hands, imagined he was talking to wire. He said the thing he believed he should. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d and then paused, because he could hear what he was about to do to his own luck, the thing pride sometimes does that is just self-sabotage with polish. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be obliged,\u201d he said instead, truth but not ruinous. \u201cI would want to be wearing the name of the thing that helps me and not making a fuss about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll let us put a wheat sheaf on your bib,\u201d the man said, like an oath, and stuck out his hand and then pulled it back because nobody shakes hands anymore and also his hand was sticky. He wiped it on a napkin and then extended it again. Real handshake this time, warm palm, sincere grip.\n\nNate laughed, too loudly in his own hearing, the way you do when something relieves tension you were pretending you did not have. He looked at Gertie, who nodded at him like a general. He took the man\u2019s hand and a little bit of what he had wanted settled into him, quick and lovely as a spoon. He said, \u201cOkay. Okay.\u201d\n\nThe man wrote a number on a piece of paper, a pledge like a neighborly handshake written down. It was not a number that solved everything, but it didn\u2019t have to be; it made the rest possible. He had some saved. He could do the rest. It meant, practically, a week of careful dinners, a fraying of comfort in the service of purpose. He understood that trade. He took the paper and folded it and imagined the train.\n\nThat night he lay in bed and let the train in his head go east. Past the yards. Past the backyard trampolines and laundry lines. Past the flat line of fields carved into snow and then through forest, true wild, where the sky lowers itself as if to eavesdrop. He could feel the motion of it. He whispered to himself like a man calming something. He said, so quiet, \u201cI get to go,\u201d and believed it.\n\nIn the morning, he went to the Via Rail site again and this time he did not close the tab. He found a fare that did not break him, and a seat that promised a window. He put in his card numbers the way he always did, resolute as screws. He clicked purchase and the little wheel spun and for a second the universe could have gone either way, because that is how computers perform suspense, and then it slowed, and stopped, and he had a ticket number.\n\nHe set the phone down and stared at the ceiling as if it were painted with a map only he could read. It felt\u2014of course it did\u2014like the opening of something large, even though he knew it might be only the opening of a very small thing that looked large today. It was good. Even if he did not win a thing besides a bib and his own giggle, it was good.\n\nHe went to work. It was easier to carry ladders when your heart is full. He pulled wires and fixed switches and in one living room talked softly to a timid cat who believed the ladder was an insult. Winnipeg did its Winnipeg thing and served him a day in a tone between steel and caramel. He ate soup out of a thermos because being careful doesn\u2019t have to taste like punishing yourself. He skipped the Blue Goose because he didn\u2019t want to make the day too neat. He saved it for tomorrow. He saved\u2014the habit of this was a muscle. It made other kinds of saving feel possible.\n\nOn the last night before he left he went to his mother\u2019s to drop off a spare key because she liked to check his plants and eat his yogurt and pretend she was only checking whether his stove was on. She made him borscht as if he were leaving for sea and could never find beets again. He told her the plan and she nodded as if trains were old friends she had always expected to see reappear at this very moment, on her doorstep, with pie.\n\n\u201cWhen you look out the window,\u201d she said, wiping her hands on a dish towel that had been a better dish towel long ago, \u201cyou will think you are seeing a movie. Twice you will see a moose and think you imagined it. Once you will see a fox. You will pass through the dark and wake in the dark and your body will say what is this. You will listen to someone tell you the whole of their life and you will be a good man and not be bored. You will be smaller when you get there because you left yourself behind, part of you, and it will catch up.\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve done this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have stayed awake at night while waiting for trains to arrive that were late and told myself stories about people on them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the same.\u201d\n\nHe hugged her. She smelled like onions and winter. She put two pairs of socks in his bag as if the modern world had forgotten to invent warm socks and mothers were still required. He let her. He would wear them and when his feet were warm he would think: I am a person with a mother.\n\nWhen he left, she stood at the window doing the thing that she always did, which was to pretend she wasn\u2019t thinking about saying something that she then said. She lifted the pane and leaned out a little, as if speaking to a child at a snowbank. \u201cNathan,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you win, you will forget at once the train ride. If you do not, you will remember. Either way, call me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will call you,\u201d he said, out loud, to the winter, to the person he had been when he had said no, to the person he was becoming now in the chill that said: pay attention. He put his hands in his pockets and walked along the shoveled sidewalk, grateful to the unknown neighbor who had done that good and beautiful thing before the city had to ask. The moon was out, scissored by bare branches. He thought: a life is like this, sharp, pale, sometimes needing to borrow light. He thought about pie and about trains and about wire and about hands that could hold all of it, gently, without dropping, for as long as necessary and then longer. He went home to sleep the way a well-wound clock must sleep\u2014by permission.",

The radiator ticked like a polite insect. Somewhere in the building\u2019s lungs, water made a sound like it had to be somewhere else in a hurry. He reached for the phone and did the thing he had decided he would do last night when he had imagined, with the righteousness of a man about to be tested, that he would act like someone who didn\u2019t need reminding: he turned the alarm off before it could boss him. He made coffee with the same neatness he brought to panels, set out his Thermos, set out the two ham-and-mustard sandwiches he had wrapped in wax paper because foil felt like theater for a man on a train. He checked his bag in a sequence\u2014socks (mother: accounted for), ticket on the phone, spare portable charger, a sweater that felt like a hug with an opinion, two paperbacks because as much as he trusted modern batteries he trusted pages more. He put a small screwdriver in the outside pocket because you never know when you might be required to show the world that hinge pins and battery compartments have nothing to fear.\n\nHe stepped into the hall with the reverence reserved for a quiet that could be injured. The stairwell air had that institutional tang of floor cleaner and old snow. Outside, the curb looked like it had grown up with him, familiar and unbothered by his news. The van was a dark shape under a fine glaze, everyone\u2019s sugar, the street\u2019s confirmation. He scraped the windshield with the brisk efficiency of a man with a train to catch and a dislike of performative struggle. He didn\u2019t trust the van to be forgiving if he left it in long-term parking, and besides, Raj had already texted that he would drive him the last few blocks from his place because he liked the idea of being part of the procession of departure. He slid behind the wheel and listened to the engine\u2019s mile-long yawn and thought, not self-mockingly, that the sound of you leaving is sometimes the first applause.\n\nUnion Station in Winnipeg has the kind of bones that make you behave. Its stone makes you feel like you would be a better person if you lowered your voice. The long hall held a handful of figures\u2014people who knew the train schedule in their legs, people who had never taken a train before and were thinking very hard about how to make that obvious, people who had done this enough to look bored and were in danger of being mistaken for romantic. The bench seats had polished a shine into themselves with decades of waiting. Above it all, the ceiling looked like something that had once been painted with angels and then, in a fit of prairie pragmatism, sanded down to a dignified cream.\n\nHe stood with his bag at his feet and looked at the departure board because you have to look at something. PORTE 1 clung to the French like a refrain. TORONTO VIA THE LAKEHEAD looked like a story you could add pictures to. The announcement came in the two voices of the country, the second voice with the roundness his mother teased into the word sorry, and he found himself relaxing as if the bilingualism were a blanket. The track listing clicked a column over. A child somewhere dropped a toy and howled as if offended by gravity itself. A man with a guitar case had the broken proud look of someone who had decided a long time ago to keep doing a thing that loved him only most days. On the wall, the framed photographs of trains through seasons were arranged with the moral weight of saints.\n\nRaj appeared out of the winter like it was a curtain he was parting for effect. He had a paper bag that had the exaggerated grease blush of breakfast sandwiches too eager to be coy. \u201cOne is for me,\u201d he said, already chewing, \u201cand one is for you unless you have decided to live like a monk on this sacred morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have ham,\u201d Nate said, lifting the corner of his bag as if to show documents. \u201cBut I will not argue with egg.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should never argue with egg,\u201d Raj said, and put the bag into his hand and then did what good friends do when their jokes land in rooms that are serious: he stopped. He looked at Nate and said, low, not for drama but to get it into the ear in the true way, \u201cI am proud. I would be proud if you were going to a conference about screws. But I am especially proud because this is the kind of thing people will call silly and you did not let that word decide for you. Take pictures from the window. If you see a moose, I will accept a description that is mostly antlers.\u201d\n\nNate grinned in spite of the part of him that was busy recounting the order of cars in a train he could not see yet, like reciting a prayer to calm a stomach. \u201cI will text you if I see a fox,\u201d he said. \u201cThe moose can be saved for a poem.\u201d\n\nThey bumped shoulders because hugging felt like showing off in a building that had seen troops leave for wars and children leave for colleges and didn\u2019t need his little sentimentalities performed in the aisle. When they called boarding, he moved with the group down the long throat of the platform toward the snow-breathed beast that was the Canadian, its stainless sides dull in the pale light, windows winking like patient eyes. The conductor at the stairs had the kind face of a man who had been asked many questions about assigned seats and was still willing to answer them as if for the first time. \u201cCoach to the right,\u201d he said, in a rhythm that was geography and refrain. \u201cDome open later. Lake on your left if you\u2019re lucky.\u201d\n\nHe found his seat with the instinct of someone who has learned the algebra of personal space: not too near the bathroom, not under a vent that had opinions, not next to the man with shoes shedding mud like a confession. He slid his bag up and felt the relief of closeness and containment that envelopes sometimes give. Outside, the platform looked like a stage you had walked away from while the show continued behind you. A woman tapped on his window and he startled until he realized she hadn\u2019t tapped; his own brain had delivered an echo of every farewell movie ever made, the hand on glass, the train pulling away, someone running and someone no longer running.\n\nThe train\u2019s first lurch had the weight of decision. It carried them past the brick and stone of the station, past the winter-still Forks and the stutter of people on blades on the Red River skating trail, past the wefts of graffitied retaining walls where spray paint had turned teenage desire into geography, past yards with trampolines like winter crowns, past piles of snow like moats around small castles of practicality. Winnipeg spread its paleness beside them and then, without ceremony, dropped away into flat. He watched the city go with an attention he reserved for goodbyes he didn\u2019t intend to make a fuss over. He was not leaving for good; he would be home before his philodendron had time to register his absence. Still, the sensation was clear: there he went.\n\nIn the seat beside him an older woman unrolled a little wool blanket that had clearly been to more places than some people. She had the calm of a person who carried knitting without needing to take it out yet. On the aisle, a boy with a buzz cut scrolled on a phone and chewed gum with the passionate energy of someone who had not had coffee and yet possessed a metabolism like a series of trampolines. Across the way a man in a parka with reflective strips sat down and promptly fell asleep, his hands folded under his chin as if in prayer. The car had that sound trains have, a layered set of songs: the whir and clack, the occasional thunk of track realities, a soft hiss when the car sighed at a crossing as if exasperated with the way humans arrange roads with such confidence.\n\nHe took his sandwich out and ate it in polite bites because something about trains made you perform your manners for the floor. The mustard was perfect. He let his eyes be greedy. The prairie in winter can be accused of sameness by those who only look at the big shapes. He had learned differently. There were lines, tucked under lines, history lain down by wind and by hand, fences that stood anyway, crows like punctuation. The sun worked hard and advanced the light only a little, stubborn as a mason setting bricks in cold.\n\nBy Portage la Prairie a child had made her way past with a plastic horse whose mane had known the indignities of love. She fell into Nate\u2019s aisle with the abandon of people who consider gravity only an occasional suggestion. The horse\u2019s tail detached in protest. The child\u2019s face did that morphing thing all kids\u2019 faces do\u2014astonishment into betrayal into fury\u2014about a plastic tail. He was already bending with a hand out, because the reflex to hand a screwdriver to grief was deeply ingrained. He took the little tail in his palm, turned it, saw the tiny nub of a post that needed a patient twist, and reached into the pocket that had the tool he had packed precisely for this sort of thing he hadn\u2019t been able to name. He looked at the mother\u2014young, tired, eyes like someone who had read the night from start to finish without blinking\u2014and lifted his eyebrows with the question. She nodded, gratitude already queued up behind her reserves.\n\n\u201cIt was born without it,\u201d the child announced, already having decided the narrative.\n\n\u201cAll the best horses improvise,\u201d he said, and turned the post, gentle, slow, a half-spin and in. The tail sat back in the place designed for it as if this had always been a moment trees had been grown to become. He handed it back solemnly. The child took it with the seriousness kids reserve for people who don\u2019t tell them they\u2019re cute. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, as if reporting to a captain. She turned to go, remembered something, and returned to show him that the horse could indeed swish, a demonstration so proud and so brief it elevated the whole day by a centimeter.\n\nBy the time they reached the turn where the tracks begin their long conversation with lake and forest, people had established the habits that would carry them for the next many hours. The man with the reflective jacket snored politely. The boy with the gum had acquired a deck of cards and, lacking a partner, dealt solitaire in a way that made it look like he was practicing for a life of spectacular disagreements with fate. The blanket woman brought out her knitting and knit as if there were a level of peace available to those who counted stitches. A conductor came through with the check, the punch on the paper tickets making a snow of tiny circles on the carpet where they had been made a hundred thousand times before. He wore a name tag that read JACQUES in neat black letters, no extravagance, and the way he said dome to the woman across the aisle had that roundness his mother had mentioned, the vowel a longer joy than his tongue would have given it.\n\n\u201cYou can go up into the dome whenever you like,\u201d Jacques said, finding the line between instruction and invitation. \u201cIt is better when it is darker. You see everything and nothing and it is romantic if you are in the mood and spooky if you are not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am exactly in between,\u201d the woman said, and Jacques smiled in a way that said he had been in between and had lived to tell it.\n\nWhen Nate wandered forward later, the car with the curve of glass felt like entering a throat made of sky. The seats pointed upward and outward, an insistence, a gentle bossiness to look, really look. The winter was a flicker book. Trees pressed up to the tracks like those kids at aquariums who cannot help but stick their tongues to the glass to see if the ocean will taste of anything besides cleaner. Once, twice, three times, he thought he saw a fox unspool itself from shadow and race parallel a few yards before cutting away into certainty. People murmur in dome cars. It has the feeling of a church, of a place designed for awe where even the atheists keep their voices low because it seems rude to speak at full human volume in front of trees that have agreed to be beautiful for us even when we are busy.\n\nHe watched as low roofs of small towns slid past, the names on their water towers like nicknames you could make poems out of if you were that kind. He saw a snowmobile trail intersect the world like a private thought. He felt the train\u2019s power\u2014the part that isn\u2019t noise but a muscle working somewhere below your feet, a kind of giant calf raising and lowering itself in smooth mechanical repetitions\u2014and thought about how none of this happened because of magic and all of it looked like magic anyway. After a while, Jacques came up and sat on the little step at the top, the way conductors have a right to occupy any liminal space, and told a story to no one in particular because dome cars make storytellers generous.\n\n\u201cI was a boy when I first rode this and I got a nosebleed,\u201d he said, addressing the glass as if it owed him a response. \u201cMy mother did not have a tissue so she used the ticket. It looked like the trip itself had cost blood. When we got to Thunder Bay she cried in a way she did not think I could hear, and I thought, ah, the world is too big for my mother. Then she tied a scarf around her head and went into the station and came out holding a paper bag and she had bought doughnuts and I thought, no, my mother is too big for the world.\u201d\n\nNate listened and smiled into his sleeve because the story was entire and didn\u2019t need him to poke it. He let the day lay itself down. He went back to his seat when his stomach told him about time. He ate half of one ham-and-mustard sandwich and saved the rest because he averaged abundance as a policy. He texted his mother a picture of nothing in particular\u2014white and trees and the edge of train window\u2014and she texted back: drink water, and then, because she was a person who could not resist transformation, she added: and look for fox. He texted Raj a moose emoji followed by a question mark. He texted Gertie a picture of the dome with the caption: where angels and old men with stories live, and she sent him back seventeen wheat-sheaf emojis and a sound file of her saying in a stage whisper: do not disgrace Manitoba.\n\nEverything took longer than you think on trains because you have to wait for other versions of your plan to finish doing theirs on the rails. The freight hung around on sidings, enormous patience disguised as unwieldiness, and they stopped to let the work of the country pass them the way you hold a door for someone carrying something that might break your foot. Nobody in the car seemed especially upset by the delays because everything about the train asks you to consider that perhaps time hunger is a habit and not a requirement. If he felt a small bite of anxiety at the thought of arriving late into a city that would not wait for him to put his heart down and find the door he needed to find, he did not let it goad him. He looked at the schedule and at the printed sheet they had given him at the station and he did the math the way he did math for panels, with an acceptance that sometimes numbers can be persuaded by tone.\n\nAt a longer stop, somewhere that smelled like tin and frost, the smokers lined up under a sky that did not care about nicotine or sorrow. He stepped onto the platform because his bones wanted novelty. Cold ran up his pants like a prankster and then he was fine. The air had that bite that makes you stand straighter without permission. He had a thermos and cradled it in his hands and sipped in the church of outdoors because coffee has souls in it when you are facing a line of trees that you will never, ever be able to name. A woman beside him lifted her face to the blue as if she had an argument with it. \u201cMy nephew lives in Owen Sound,\u201d she said, apropos of the sky. \u201cHe says people in Toronto do not know how to drive, and I tell him: people anywhere forget their hands when the streets are large.\u201d\n\n\u201cHands are everything,\u201d he said, because he was an electrician and the statement needed no qualification.\n\nShe nodded. \u201cYou look like a man who fixes small things as if they were big,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are grateful for you, even if we\u2019re not in your house when you\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nBack in his seat, he found he had become enough of a person in the car for someone to slide a crossword toward him with the nib of a pen pointed at 18 down. \u201cConductor\u2019s call,\u201d the boy with the cards said, excited to share puzzle as if it were a contraband candy. \u201cSix letters.\u201d\n\n\u201cTickets,\u201d someone said from two rows back, and the boy glowed as if he had been offered a job. They filled in words together for a few minutes and it felt like the sort of community that can only exist between strangers, a temporary country with no taxes and polite customs.\n\nWhen the light tilted down toward evening, domes collected people again. The car drew out of it the people who did not yet know what it was they wanted and then gave it to them, the trees in that end-of-day color that looks like the inside of a ripe pear. Snowmelt in ditches crusted over in sudden cold looked like glass put down by someone who had intended to come back to it with a sketchbook. The rhythm altered, the train negotiating a section of track that had opinions, and a small girl said wow at exactly the moment you would want a small girl to say wow and everyone let out the breath they didn\u2019t know they were holding because it is kind when someone does the feeling-labor for you out loud.\n\nHe slept in the hunched, undignified posture of economy class, his neck making a list of complaints and then agreeing to deliver them later to his pillow rather than now to the car. He woke at odd hours and the outside was another country each time, night having made arenas of the spaces between trees. He went to the snack car at two in the morning because he wanted to test the theory that all coffee tastes better when bought at an hour that makes your future self frown, and found it wrapped in a glow that made everyone look like actors on a set where the set dresser had been paid for their good taste. He bought a coffee that was mostly generosity and a cookie that had a surprising integrity, and he took both to a seat by the window and looked at his own reflection as if he were a man he had not met yet. A couple in their sixties argued softly about the route of a road they had driven thirty years ago. A young guy with a tattoo of a swallow on his neck gazed at his phone with the tenderness of a parent at a sleeping child. The attendant ran a rag along the counter with that eternal rhythm of people who tend small, necessary surfaces.\n\nThere was a flicker at the far end of the car, the overhead lights doing the indecisive blink that heralds either a bulb in its last act or a switch complaining about age. The attendant\u2019s face did the quick math of potential annoyance. It was impulsive, or maybe it was the sort of impulse that has been trained to think of itself as duty, but Nate lifted a palm like a student and said, \u201cDo you mind if I take a look.\u201d He said it softly so as not to call himself what he didn\u2019t want to be called, a savior for something that didn\u2019t require one.\n\nThe attendant looked at him and then at his hands and then at the small screwdriver peeking from his pocket because there are tells to competency. \u201cIf you can sweet-talk that fixture into giving me another two days, I\u2019ll buy your coffee,\u201d she said, and he smiled because the coffee was already drunk but the deal was good in spirit and that\u2019s what mattered.\n\nHe climbed up on the little bench, careful, deliberate, holding himself lightly as if his body could be made shame-proof by grace. He popped the lens cover with a practiced wrist and set it on the counter like a delicate object even though it was plastic that could take a joke. He checked the connections, snugged the wire in the tiny clip that had clearly been jostled by time and the particular jiggle of trains, and saw the flicker settle out to a calm he could feel as much as see. He replaced the cover, wiped his palm on his jeans in that universal gesture of done, and stepped down to a small chorus of ah, which is the sound humans make when the world remembers itself. The attendant slid him a napkin with a scribble on it and he laughed when he read it later. The napkin said: one free cookie redeemable upon proof of sorrow. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ll have one worth a cookie at some point,\u201d she said, and he waved the napkin like a white flag, like an agreement, like permission.\n\nThe hours between dusk and perfect night passed in murmurs. He slept a little more and dreamt nothing he could retrieve. At dawn he was awake before the light and then in it when it arrived, the forest becoming more itself. Northern Ontario unrolled in patient squares and circles of stubborn growth. Rock shouldered up out of the earth as if to say: I remember glaciers and you do not. Lakes appeared and left with a shyness that made you wish to apologize as you looked at them. Occasionally a moose-shaped dark would be insisted upon by someone and then apologized for when it turned into a bush with too much confidence. He saw a fox. He saw it with the uncomplicated joy of someone whose mother had made a prediction that the universe had decided to honor. It moved across a clearing with a pace that had nothing to do with human time. He lifted his phone for the picture and then did not, because he wanted to have something that was only for him and his mother and anyone he loved enough to tell.\n\nHis mother answered on the second ring when he called from a little vestibule that smelled like coin and cold and the kind of oil that makes magic under metal. \u201cFox,\u201d he said, without preamble, proud as if he had made the animal out of spare buttons and ingenuity. She made a sound on the line that was half laugh and half old country blessing. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cNow do not get cocky and look for wolf. There is arrogance and then there is foolishness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fixed a light,\u201d he said, and then laughed at himself because he had become someone whose updates were wildlife and bulbs, and he loved that for himself. He told her about the dome and about Jacques and the knitting, and she told him about how at Safeway they had moved the pickles to the other side of the aisle and she had stood there for an embarrassing amount of time thinking that perhaps the world had ended. When he hung up he had the feeling he had after successfully making a ground connection in an old house\u2014relief, hum, stability.\n\nBy the time they pulled into Sudbury Junction, a name that sounded like a person you might date in high school, the sky had gone a proper blue instead of the white that performs uncommitted impressions. Sudbury had a smokestack like a cigarette in a painting, obscene and necessary. People joined them with last-minute snow on their boots and the look of people who had just told someone they would behave and did not mean it. He stretched in the aisle with the courtesy a man gives to an aisle that has made room for his limbs. The boy with the cards had acquired a friend, and they were now playing in a way that involved slapping and shouts stifled into smaller, more train-appropriate shouts.\n\nHe met a man in the dome later with a camera lens long enough to make Chadwick Boseman\u2019s cheekbones feel surveilled from a city away. The man spoke about light like it owed him money. \u201cThe shield,\u201d the man said, pointing with his chin at the world as if the earth were a smaller thing that could be indicated usefully. \u201cAncient rock. It makes a man feel new and tired at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fix things that pretend they want to die,\u201d Nate said, and the man considered this politely as if he were taste-testing a metaphor, and then nodded as if it passed.\n\nHe dozed and woke and the hours compressed the way they do when you are both eager and content. He thought about the contest in a way that settled into him like good bread: heavy, satisfying, not swollen with air. The emails had clarified that there would be press and he reminded himself he could be funny enough to give the cameras something that wasn\u2019t just a caught-in-headlights face full of pastry. He thought about the other contestants, avatars on a page he had half-stalked. A woman from Halifax who had opinions on meringue that could serve as a manifesto. A man from Calgary whose Instagram was a parade of gym and bakery and who had, inexplicably, founded a charity knitting club that made hats shaped like pies for babies. A teen from northern Quebec whose entire vibe was two parts sugar anarchist, one part grandma-approved tradition, and one part haircut that frightened mothers.\n\nThey made Toronto in the gray that city centers wear in winter\u2014the particular gleam of wet steel, the way the light refuses to be loyal to any one building, the cold rising from the stone like a rumor of something that had happened long ago. Union Station\u2019s platforms were caves that hummed with commerce. He stepped down into the bath of noise as if into water and felt the edges of himself come up alert. The hall was bright and loud, its fonts declaring a modernity that felt like it was politely ignoring Winnipeg\u2019s Beaux-Arts aunt. People moved with purpose, their luggage wheels yelling their thoughts into the hollow of the ceiling. He followed the flow, a fish in a school, and found himself spat into that part of Toronto that insists it is the center of all maps\u2014taxis and glass, buskers doing their valiant printed-scarf tricks, a woman in a coat so excellent it made his hands itch because he wanted to tell her that someone somewhere had loved her enough to hand her this and say wear it, be brilliant.\n\nHe shouldered his bag and let his body catch up with the speed of this place. He had a cheap hotel two subway stops away, a room that promised a bed and a television that would try to sell him a better mattress than the one he was lying on. He found the subway with the help of signs that were determined to be helpful in two languages and three moods, bought a pass because he liked the feeling of a card opening something, a door, a day, and stood in the train as it needed him to. Toronto under Toronto moved like a river that had learned grammar. He watched how people made room for each other and bumped anyway and apologized and sometimes didn\u2019t. Winnipeg had taught him to make a face at this and then forgive it. He put his bag by his feet and resisted the politely feral instinct to smile at strangers because he knew here that could look like an insult or worse, an invitation.\n\nThe hotel was exactly what the internet had promised and precisely less, which meant he trusted it. The desk clerk was soft-spoken in a way that made everyone else in the lobby a bad decision. The carpet had a geometry it had not consented to. The bed was so determined to be a bed it almost apologized for its own rectangle. He dropped his bag on the chair that he wouldn\u2019t use for anything except holding his bag because there is something about it being there that tells a room: I am not moving in, calm down. He put his hand on the window and felt the city through the glass, a hum across his skin, and thought about calling his mother and decided to check in with the part of him that had come all this way. He sat on the bed, folded in the middle where the cheap mattress confessed itself, and took out the bib. He had told himself he wouldn\u2019t wear it in the mirror because that felt like tempting fate on the level of telling a house you didn\u2019t like its wallpaper. He draped it over the chair instead. The wheat sheaf in the corner. A Manitoban banner that looked like it had not been drawn by a committee but by a hand that understood wheat as the emblem not of quaintness but of a stubborn insistence on life.\n\nHe walked down to the venue later because walking is how you reclaim a city from your nerves. It was a market space turned competition hall, lights strung so that it looked like a wedding had agreed to accommodate sport. The stage had three long tables bracketed by cameras like curious geese. Volunteers in t-shirts the color of victory moved with the helpfulness that comes with being fed and appreciated. He found Drew at a registration table framed by a display of fonts. Drew\u2019s eyebrows lifted when he saw him, the quiet satisfaction of a spreadsheet reconciled and an old man\u2019s story about the dome car confirmed. \u201cYou made it,\u201d he said, as if conferring an achievement rather than narrating a fact.\n\nHe signed where he was told to sign and read what he was told to read and adopted his laminated badge with the light embarrassment that comes from wearing your own name under your face. \u201cMedia run-through at ten,\u201d a bright volunteer named Frankie told him cheerfully. \u201cInterview after your heat. We\u2019re rescue dogs with hydration if you need it. And yes, the pies are identical. That question comes up more than hearts can bear.\u201d\n\nHe walked the floor and felt the particular shiver that comes from all the electricity in a room being eager at once. He stood at the edge where his table would be, looked at the row of plates he was allowed to consider as instruments and not just plates, at the stack of napkins, at the little display that indicated that some part of this would be pretend. He thought of the boy with the cards and of Jacques and of the fox. He thought of the light in the snack car and of the little horse tail that had been persuaded to return to a destiny it had wandered away from. He could feel the part of him that wanted to take this all too seriously, the part that believed that the way you do any small thing is the way you will do it all and that therefore this mattered like a proof of character. He gently sent that part of himself to sit in the corner and watch. He would let another part of himself\u2014the one that had laughed with his face purpled by Saskatoons\u2014hold the forkless instrument of his absurd craft.\n\nHis phone buzzed while he was standing there, absorbing the very idea of Toronto being willing to make room for a prairie man\u2019s minor glory. His mother had sent a picture of his kitchen window with the note: I watered the plant. It looked at me like a suspect. He smiled back at the image as if it could feel him. Gertie sent a voice memo that was ninety percent bracelets clinking and ten percent, \u201cRemember: mouth like a machine and heart like a poet.\u201d He received a text from the Winnipeg Agricultural Society that consisted entirely of a cartoon sheaf of wheat lifting a tiny barbell. Raj sent, succinctly, run the table.\n\nHe took a breath the way the good runners do, not in his throat but in his ribs. He looked around at the other contestants finding their places, some of them wearing seriousness that did not suit them yet but would, perhaps, by the end. He looked at the cameras and at the volunteers and at the table where a man from a television station would later ask him how to spell Kowalsky and how much pie a person could put in his mouth and still call himself a gentleman. He touched his chest like a man reminding himself where he had put his keys. He thought about how many hands had carried him here, the literal and the metaphorical ones, and felt a gratitude that did not require an audience. He tasted mustard, ancient and fresh on the back of his tongue, and imagined a fox moving through trees where no one else could see it and knew he was exactly where he had decided to be. He stood. He waited for the whistle that would turn the next few minutes into a story he would tell and tell until it became the shape of this year. He did not pray, because this was not that, but he did the second-cousin of prayer. He promised himself that he would not be stingy with joy. He promised himself that whatever this was, it would count. He let the city, his city and this city, settle around him like jackets borrowed from good people. When Drew\u2019s voice rose and the room turned itself into attention, he smiled, a small upward motion that had traveled a long way to find its place.",

It made people straighten, it made cameras remember their marks, it made volunteers who had been smiling in an abstract way begin to smile in a directed way, at faces they could anchor to later in stories and captions. The pies had already been placed with the solemnity of chess pieces, nine to a table, a grid that would soon lose its straight lines. Butter tart pies, glossy and brown as polished desk wood, the surface tremoring slightly if you breathed too hard near them. Ontario had chosen its emblem and it made sense; sugar here had a note of history about it, the kind that came in under the date on a ledger and stayed.\n\nNate found his stance and then chose not to think of it as a stance because stances were for people who thought they needed to declare in advance who they were. He rolled his shoulders and let his breath flatten and settle where it was supposed to live, not high in his throat but where his ribs could help. The plastic bib lay cool against his neck, wheat sheaf at the corner like a companion who had opinions but had promised to keep them to himself until the appropriate time. He looked left and right once, not competitive, just curious. On his left a woman with hair in a braid that had known other braids gave him a quick nod, businesslike. On his right a man in a fitted t-shirt that suggested familiarity with kettlebells bounced on his toes once, the kind of bounce intended to shake foolishness out of calves and keep only purpose.\n\nDrew\u2019s voice rolled out over the room and made jokes at the edges like a man lighting candles in a draft. Somewhere in the press behind the cameras, he could hear a kid ask whether they would get to keep the plates. The answer was no, but it was the sort of question that made a room dearer. The judge with the microphone and the hair that had been asked to be aspirational explained the rules again in case someone had swapped their brain for nerves and needed to rehang their understanding on something simple. No hands. Eight minutes. Water if you want it. If you choke, we will stop you and nobody will be brave about it, we will just be kind. The room laughed where it was meant to and then settled in again, as if tucking knees under blankets.\n\nHe leaned, when the second signal came, the way he would lean into a cabinet to see which wire had decided to pretend it had no friends. The first bite was always reconnaissance. The butter tart filling had a caramel depth that argued with his instincts about speed. The crust was less delicate than Gertie\u2019s, more municipal, sturdy, a pie engineered to withstand Toronto. He adjusted his rhythm. He was not the fastest in the room and he knew it now, the same way a man knows when his drill\u2019s battery is just past the sweet spot. He compensated with efficiency. He didn\u2019t waste the bring down to the plate and the bring up to the mouth. He let his jaw do what it had been doing for him faithfully his entire life. He did not try to be interesting; he tried to be good.\n\nHe heard the crowd in an underwater way, the hollers and the deliberate cheers patterned by friendship and by signage. He knew exactly when a camera found him because some part of the room\u2019s attention sharpened like a knife angled at light. He thought of the boy on the Winnipeg trail with the pizza-box sign and did not laugh because laughing cost time. He breathed in counts\u2014small, small, long\u2014and let the filling be what it was, a glue of memory and the bragging rights of sugar. He did not think about the absurdity of this as evidence of character. He did not think about his mother\u2019s voice from the week before blessing and scolding him into balance. He kept his face aimed at the work like a man who knew how to be loyal to something when he had said yes to it.\n\nAround minute six, the woman with the braid found a gear that made him admire and not envy her. She did a neat thing with her tongue at the edge of the crust and it turned what should have been scrabble for crumbs into choreography. The man with the kettlebell calves faltered, not in heart but in plan, and lifted his head too long between bites, hunting air as if he\u2019d misfiled it. Nate found his steady. He thought about the dome car and the rhythm of track under him and let that become the metronome for his ridiculous work. He was a person who cherished the steady, and here was a place to employ it in honorable silliness.\n\nWhen the horn at eight brought hands up and heads up and napkins forward, the room exhaled as if it had been underwater with him. He sat back with the happy exhaustion of a person who had made sense of something only his mouth could understand. He took the water and rinsed and took another and actually drank it. The cameras were already on the faces that had made comedy out of their effort. The microphone on its official stick was somewhere else, and he was grateful for that brief non-inspection, a courtesy after intimacy. He looked down his row and saw the remains of pies that looked like maps, rivers of filling, continents of crust. His plate was almost virtuous in its tidiness, a thing he would never say aloud because the world does not reward people who boast of neatness.\n\n\u201cClean,\u201d said a voice above him, and he looked up into a grin he recognized from nights of internet sign-ups and poster-font decisions. Frankie, with her bright t-shirt, had materialized. She had a clipboard covered in stickers about hydration. \u201cYou are a champion of the paper towel economy,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was almost dainty, which is not a word we deploy often here. How do you feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a man who has done something unsuitable to the idea of breakfast,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd proud of how thoroughly unsuitable I committed.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, checked his name off, and slid a napkin to him with the sort of flourish that meant she had found her place in the theater of this. \u201cInterview three to your left if you want it. No obligation. You have pie on your ear but it feels like a personality choice.\u201d\n\nHe wiped his ear obligingly and went where the people with microphones were performing friendliness professionally. A woman with lipstick that made promises put a mic under his chin and made his name sound like it had three stages of life. He spelled it politely. She asked him which was worst, blackberry or butter tart, and he said there was no worst, there was only commitment. He said he was an electrician and that eating pie competitively taught you breath and patience, which were a kind of wire discipline. He said Winnipeg had sent him with a wheat sheaf and a sense of humor and that both had made it through security. He was pleased later to realize he had not flinched when her eyebrows arched at the mention of a sponsor that sounded like agriculture. He didn\u2019t care to let wheat be set up as quaint. Wheat had fed him and everyone he knew until other kinds of feeding were possible.\n\nHe watched strangers watch him answer questions and thought of domes again, the way the glass makes people softer without making them less serious. The Halifax woman was giving a better interview two spots down, speaking about the ethics of sugar and why she didn\u2019t trust corn syrup because it had never been honest with her. The teen from Quebec, \u00c9lodie, who had hair like a deliberate thunderstorm and a hoodie that looked absurd until you read the back and saw the message about grandmothers and recipes and the science of stubbornness, stood with her hands folded as if she were praying and scowled into the camera as if she hated it and then produced a smile as if she had picked it out of a pocket and was testing to see if it fit. The Calgary man\u2014Ty, if the hand-marker on his badge could be trusted\u2014leaned into the microphone like a person who had never been taught to be afraid of a room and said cheerful things that would cut well into ads.\n\nPreliminary results went up on the big screen with the menace of font, then sorted themselves into something like a temporary fairness. He was fourth in his heat, which meant he would get a second chance, a wildcard chew-off at two against other almosts. He took that in without flinching. His pride did not bruise easily because it had been raised by people who believed that daily work done with attention is the point and everything else is bonus. He texted Raj fourth, and Raj sent back a GIF of a man adjusting a hat with concentration, and then added: you love second chances. He texted his mother a picture of the wheat sheaf on his bib and no words and she sent back: I am at Safeway looking at the old pickle shelf in case they apologize to me by moving back. Good luck, son. He texted Gertie a single fork emoji and she returned a voice file that originated in bracelets and ended in shouting. \u201cCrush them with grace,\u201d she said. \u201cMake butter repent.\u201d\n\nWith hours to fill and a stomach that had made its opinion known about further pastry, he went outside. Toronto in daylight had a swagger that made him feel both loyal to his quieter city and eager to borrow a little of the flex. He let himself be carried on sidewalks that had nowhere for snow to sit and threw the kind of looks at buildings you reserve for people whose shoes you cannot afford but whose walk makes you reconsider your own. He went into the market because markets were his kind of chapel\u2014goods honest about being goods, people who could talk about salt and plum sauces with the conviction of someone defending a thesis. He bought a small container of pickled carrots he didn\u2019t need and ate three because he wanted the kind of crunch that reminded his jaw it could do honorable work without sugar. He stood at a stall and listened to a woman try to choose between seven kinds of olives without anyone laughing at her problem. He thought, as he always did in places like this, of all the hands, all the electricity quietly doing secular miracles above and behind and beneath, keeping cold cold and warm warm, certainly and humbly.\n\nHe might have stayed moving until the nerves resolved themselves into a quiet that would carry him, but his phone buzzed with a text from a number he didn\u2019t have saved. The text was polite in a way that suggested it had a job: hall C practice area if you want to meet your fellow wildcards, beverages involved, perhaps a debrief about the peculiarities of this particular crust. He was not against beverages or community-led reconnaissance. He went.\n\nHall C had a backstage feel\u2014tape on floors and techs in black moving like carefully choreographed shadow. There was a cluster of chairs and a carafe of coffee that had been brewed to meet the minimum standard of meeting coffee. The three other almosts were already there. The braid woman said her name was Moira and that she had never before seen volunteers move so tidily in their t-shirts. \u00c9lodie offered a hand without softening her face and introduced herself as if daring anyone to mispronounce it. Ty gave him a knuckle bump as if that were how men were required to meet somewhere west of Thunder Bay and his grin was as neat as his beard.\n\nThey talked like people who had been assigned the same difficult math problem and needed to compare the shapes of their work without cheating. They discussed crust density and the way butter tart filling glued to the palate in a way that made breath an interesting proposition. Moira had whole theories about whether you engaged the back molars or spared them and everyone listened because her braid had the gravity of elders. \u00c9lodie confessed to eating lemon the day before as training because she thought she might need a mouth reset, and then admitted that her grandmother had taught her never to enter a room hungry unless you wanted that room to own you. Ty spoke with calm zeal about tongue placement and about the trick of turning shame off like a tap.\n\nThey could have stayed there, trading small sciences and jokes and the kind of half-boasts that make you human and not unbearable, but a volunteer with a badge that read JO in a font that deserved its own applause stepped in with a clipboard that had broken two rings and continued valiantly. \u201cWildcards,\u201d Jo said with cheer that had been sustained by something other than sleep, \u201cyou\u2019re at two. House asks that you please refrain from pre-eating anything that could be construed as performance-enhancing, which apparently includes peanut butter. We live in a world of rules for reasons none of us will ever fully understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeanut butter is a character study,\u201d Moira said dryly. \u201cIt never said it wanted to hurt anyone.\u201d\n\nThey laughed and that was the point. They laughed because they needed to be part of something between panic and purpose. They went to the practice tables and mimed mouth-work in a way that would have been mortifying if they had not all been doing it at once. They were adults, after all, and the secret is that adulthood is a series of decisions to ignore the part of your brain that tells you dignity is fragile. They took sips of water and swished and spat in a trash can labeled compost as if they were at a wine tasting conducted by impish gods. Nate felt the warmth of companionship rise in him like good coffee. He liked these people. He wanted them to do well, even as he wanted to do better. He liked that wanting both could function at once.\n\nThe wildcard round began with less ceremony, which suited him. Fewer speeches, more work. The pies were set down with almost impatience, the judge\u2019s hair had relaxed, Drew\u2019s voice was still a herald but he let the sigh of a room finding second gear do some of his lifting. Nate\u2019s slot put him at the edge of the table where he could see a banner for a salt company dancing at the end of a draft. He fixed his gaze on the crust and pretended the banner did not exist because moving things wanted to be followed and he wanted to lead.\n\nThe first minute went well, too well. He forgot to stay in his body and let his head float up into the rafters, where it observed himself with the chilly remove that makes for excellent criticism and terrible performance. He nearly laughed at the stupidity of his own attention. He pulled it down again by counting his chews in French, because his mother\u2019s French was a soft coat and he knew that if he occupied himself with syllables he would keep his lungs honest. Un, deux, trois, quatre, and so on, until the numbers stopped being numbers and became beats.\n\nAt minute three he choked, not on a bite but on a memory. It arrived uninvited and full-bodied: the kitchen table at eight, his mother\u2019s hand flattening dough with a wine bottle because she didn\u2019t own a rolling pin. Butter on fingers, flour on floor, laughter that had a catch to it because rent was due. The opposite of butter tarts, a savory pie with onion and potato that had fed two boys and a woman and given them the kind of confidence that can carry you across a week. It hit him like a gust through a door not adequately sealed. He paused\u2014half a beat, not enough for anyone to see except the part of him that treasures exactness\u2014and then he kept going. He swallowed, and not just pastry.\n\nHe made the finish. Clean, again, not a monk\u2019s plate but a neat man\u2019s. He took the water with gratitude and nodded when Frankie appeared again, as if she might have been sent to measure his pulse. Ty whooped, fully himself, when it ended; Moira wiped the corner of her mouth with a napkin the way a woman might do in a dining room with linen; \u00c9lodie turned away and laughed, finally, at something her friend said in rapid French and the room moved on to the next thing because rooms always do.\n\nResults were announced with less font drama. His name was third on the list, which meant he could proceed to the finals with the steady inside him intact. He grinned in the direction of the big screen as if anyone could see him and texted Raj a single wheat sheaf. Raj responded with a picture of his own face making a noise. His mother texted: you were born with cheeks for this, which he did not care to parse. Gertie sent a series of exhortations that were either prayers or recipes.\n\nHe had hours until the final, and this time instead of walking he let himself sit. There was a chair against a wall near a service door where air from extra winter was let in occasionally by the comings and goings of things on dollies. He closed his eyes, not to sleep but to rehearse the breathing that had saved him. He put his hands on his knees and felt the blessed ordinary of bone and tendon. Someone sat down beside him and he opened his eyes out of courtesy because private sorrow can be had with eyes closed but private joy should be shared, even if only by proof of witness.\n\nIt was Moira, braid now a little looser, mouth caramel-sticky at the corner where napkin had apparently staged its retreat. She offered him a peppermint, a small act of solidarity with the conspiratorial air of dubious sports rituals. \u201cMy grandmother,\u201d she said, by way of explanation, \u201cbelieved that peppermint tells your heart to stop trying to make all the decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will obey your grandmother,\u201d he said, and let mint reassert the parts of his mouth sugar had colonized. They sat in the way people do who have only a few hours of acquaintance and the sense that a strange affection has set up a tent in the middle of their day and invited itself to tea. She told him about Halifax winds and how you learn to love a city that tries to push you off its sidewalks. He told her about Union Station\u2019s cream ceiling and how the dome car had made him feel like he had been allowed to be an organ inside a larger animal.\n\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll do this again,\u201d she asked, not fishing for a particular answer, curious in the way that good listeners always are.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I like the part where the room decides to make a silly thing sacred. I like being allowed to be the kind of person who shows up for that. It feels like the good parts of church without the parts that make me itch.\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cI was raised to believe the itch is the point,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do like when we make small joys into public work. It reminds me we are capable of more than the bureaucracy would suggest.\u201d\n\nThey were interrupted by the sound of something that had been asked to be silent and refused. A string of lights over the demo kitchen at the back of the hall had begun a stutter that would give someone a headache and give the camera operators a reason to send emails in all caps later. The nearest volunteer looked at it with the committed helplessness of a person whose to-do list had already reached the length where any new responsibility felt mythological. He could have stayed seated. He had saved his people a light at two in the morning. He was not morally obliged to fix every glowing thing in the country. He stood anyway and walked the gentle, not-interfering walk of a man who knew how to approach a problem without announcing himself as its hero.\n\nThe house tech had already arrived with a step ladder that made an unpleasant harmonic like a fork run hard around a plate. She looked at him with a squint that measured time and possible competence. \u201cAre you going to tell me how to do my job,\u201d she said, not unkindly, bracing her boot on the bottom rung and checking her belt for a tool she had likely loaned to someone earlier.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to offer to hold the ladder,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd ask you if you\u2019d like the extra pair of hands we all pretend not to need.\u201d\n\nShe grinned despite herself and tilted her head toward the ladder in invitation. He planted his feet and held. She climbed with confidence and flipped the housing open with a wrist motion that would have made Jacques in the snack car approve. \u201cConnector is sulking,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I bully it, it will behave for six hours and then tell tales about me.\u201d He passed her the little roll of electrical tape that hung on her belt and then the small flathead she had tucked in her back pocket. She snugged a wire, coaxed a clip, and the lights remembered their duty. The shadow behind the demo kitchen retreated back into wherever shadows are supposed to go during a broadcast.\n\n\u201cYou have ladder-holding hands,\u201d she said, coming down with the neatness of a person who had rehearsed this descent in the theater of their head for years. \u201cThey do not flinch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have practice,\u201d he said. \u201cIn holding and in flinching. I try to choose the former.\u201d\n\n\u201cBless you,\u201d she said, and then, because blessing was not quite her vocabulary, she added, \u201cand thanks.\u201d\n\nHe went back to his seat and sat with his hands in his lap, palms up for a minute as if catching something invisible, and Moira looked at him with a face that had moved, in their short acquaintance, from appraisal to acceptance. The peppermint thinned into thought. He closed his eyes again and did not so much think of the final as hold the idea of it gently, like something you do not want to crush by enthusiasm.\n\nThe final called them with extra glitter in the voice. The crowd had cooked itself into the temperature that makes clapping feel like part of breathing. The pies were new and looked impossibly identical in their sameness, which is the trick of show food, that you must present the idea of food back to the world as if you were telling a story about nourishment instead of giving it. He took his place and felt his knees do that little tremble that meant, simply, that he was alive. He let it be a reminder and not an indictment.\n\nThree finalists, three plates, three empty glasses set just so. Someone had made a graphic. Their names arranged themselves in a line above their heads in the big screen and there was something touching about it, as if the world had decided to write on the sky certain words it loved for the afternoon. He looked at his name and felt the letterforms become briefly unfamiliar, as if he belonged to someone else in that moment and would be returned intact after the horn. \u00c9lodie stood on his left and bounced once, not like Ty, not for calves, but like a small bird shivering itself into readiness in cold. Moira on his right did not move at all, and that, too, was a choice. He wanted to put a hand on each of their arms, like a coach in a movie, and say something that would land in their muscles, but the world did not need him to manufacture meaning where there already was plenty.\n\nThe horn cut the idea in half and they bent. Butter tart again, of course, the final meant to be the same as the test in case the narrative of practice had any moral weight. It was instinct now and not calculation. He let himself be a metronome with habits. He thought of fox and mint and dome and all of it dropped like pennies into the deep jar of his body and did what pennies do there\u2014made a dense song of small metal statements. There were yells; there were the helpful cries of people with signs; there was the particular sound a volunteer with a camera makes when they realize they are in the shot and must back up both eagerly and discreetly. There was his own breath, steady itself and asking only for the simple kindness of being given a plan. He was giving it one. He let his mouth be shameless and his heart be tender and his hands be still in view of everyone to satisfy the rule.\n\nHe lost track of the minute marks in a way that did not bother him because he was not living this to make time his pet but to prove to himself he could inhabit eight minutes without backing out. He thought of his mother\u2019s socks in his bag and of the man with the camera on the train and of Jacques\u2019s story about the bloody ticket. He kept eating. He kept going. The horn at the end was a mercy and a surprise and a sting because endings always have a little of that in them, even when they arrive on schedule.\n\nThey put their napkins down with too much dignity, which made the thing funny rather than sad. The judges conferred for longer than he thought necessary but necessary is not a measure that belongs to joy. He did not look at the screen for the replay that would show him doing a thing that looked both braver and sillier than he had felt; he kept his eyes on the little pattern in the paper napkin under his glass because small designs had saved him before, in kitchens and in halls and inside panels, when he needed to remember that the world had been arranged thoughtfully by someone, at some point, and therefore could be borne.\n\nThey announced Moira third and the room cheered in the way a room cheers a woman who has comported herself as if she has nothing to prove until suddenly she does and then proves only the thing she chooses. They announced his name second and he felt the swallow in his throat do complicated good work. He took the yellow ribbon they had printed for second and let it be what it was\u2014beautiful and a little ridiculous\u2014and he grinned in a way that made his cheeks ache. \u00c9lodie\u2019s name for first made a clean sound in the air and she startled as if someone had set off a harmless firework two inches from her ear. She covered her mouth with her hand and then, as if she had been instructed by a grandmother in a dream about how to behave when praise refuses to be coy, she uncovered it and wiped her cheeks and let herself be photographed like someone proving that they would not waste this.\n\nThere was noise. There were microphones. There was a man from the Agricultural Society who had somehow made it to Toronto with a wheat pin in his lapel and damp eyes that he pretended were about the travel. There were texts. There was a hand on his shoulder, warm and firm, that he knew before he turned belonged to Drew, who had the look of a facilitator whose spreadsheet had become a parade. There was a volunteer pressing a bottle of water into his palm as if he had run a race, as if this counted, and he knew it did, in the way that we assign weight to frivolities when they gather enough laughter around them.\n\nHe did the interviews again and did them better because he had practice and because his heart had done some work on the train with strangers. He told a man with a tape recorder that he loved the moment a silly thing and sincerity meet, that he would go home with a small second-place thing in his bag and that it would clutter his shelf in a way that could only improve the room. He told a woman with glasses that he had almost not come and that the universal fact of the world is that the trains exist and the people who help you buy tickets exist and if you are lucky there is pie at the end but if there isn\u2019t then there is still the dome and Jacques and fox and the peppermint that tells your heart to quiet down.\n\nHe got away, finally, escaping the stage by walking in plain sight like a man carrying a ladder in a room full of people who instinctively make way for someone with a tool. He found the quiet of a staircase that led nowhere anyone important would be going and sat with his ribbon in his lap and let himself be tired. His phone buzzed evenly, a string of congratulations from numbers that had found him, some belonging to people he would never meet who had decided for a day to take him into their possession as a thing to root for, the way cities allot themselves small saints for seasonal devotion. He answered what he could and allowed the rest to belong to the room, to the event, to the part of his life that would live a while online without him. He texted Raj a picture of himself with \u00c9lodie and Moira and the three of them holding up their little tokens with honesty and not a lick of mockery. Raj replied with a photo of Mrs. Banerjee\u2019s dog wearing, inexplicably, a paper crown, and the words: you remain intolerable in all the best ways.\n\nHe called his mother and she answered with the sound of her house behind her, the kettle pretending it had always been boiling. \u201cSecond,\u201d he said, and there was a beat exactly as long as a cheer being gathered and then let go.\n\n\u201cSecond is heaven,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst is a feast you cannot digest before people come asking for recipes. Second is food you can put in containers and eat all week. I am proud. Also, a woman in line in front of me just tried to use a debit card that did not exist and everyone decided to forgive her. Winnipeg sends you forgiveness and beets.\u201d\n\nHe almost said he had seen a fox again because he wanted to live in a world with omens, but he had not and he would not lie to make a story give him better gifts. He told her instead the truth of the peppermints and of Moira\u2019s braid and of the boy with the cards on the train and she made approving noises at all the right places. He did not notice until afterward that he had given her very little about the pie itself and much about the people, and that seemed right. The pie had been a structure to house the real work, which was attention.\n\nBy the time he stepped out into Toronto\u2019s evening, the city had put its jewelry back on. Light climbed up buildings in stacks and made people look like they had been asked to play versions of themselves and had agreed. He walked toward his hotel because there was nothing left to do except what there always is\u2014eat something worthy, drink water, sleep. He found, on the way, a small place that advertised Ukrainian food with less embarrassment than he had expected and the kind of plastic-cut plant in the window that told him someone inside had decided to be tidy about hope. He went in. He ate borscht that tasted like a memory written by someone else\u2019s aunt and perogies that were less delicate than his mother\u2019s and more frank than his. He sat with his ribbon in his pocket and did not take it out because it took up exactly the right amount of space where it was. He left a tip he could afford and thought about how sometimes spending a little on something after a win is not bad stewardship but celebration, and that too is a skill a man can learn without collapsing anything useful inside himself.\n\nBack in the room, he put the ribbon on the cheap dresser with the wheat bib under it and the effect, to his eye, was ridiculous and perfect. He took a picture of it and did not send it to anyone because he wanted one image to belong only to him. He brushed his teeth for a long time and then again because the butter tart had declared a residency and he was the landlord. He lay down and felt the city under him, the hum that was not his but that he could borrow. He had the thought, just before sleep took his hand and led him through a door, that he would fix the humming light again at the snack bar if asked and that there was something in that impulse that mattered more than any ribbon ever would. He dreamed of trains and of small horses with mended tails running beside them, unafraid of the noise, sure of the track because someone in the car above was holding a ladder for someone else and the light, when tested, did not flicker.",

March had decided to rehearse at the edges, streaking the snowbanks with a graying that looked like the city\u2019s five o\u2019clock shadow. On the boulevards, rinds of ice loosened their grip and the gutters began their annual soliloquy, water gossiping toward drains like it had a great deal to tell. The van started on the second try and Nate took it personally as a love letter he would not overinterpret, and he drove to his first job after Toronto with a ribbon in the glove box that he had already forgotten, twice, and then found again as if finding it were part of the bargain.\n\nThe job was at a community rink in St. James where the lights, as the caretaker put it, were \u201cdeciding to be poets about illumination.\u201d The fixtures hung from rafters that had seen a generation of fathers teach a generation of children to wobble confidently; the wood had the long, dry smell of a place you don\u2019t mind breathing in. He had been told, on the phone, that sometimes three lights went at once and sometimes two and sometimes they took turns winking like aunties who did not approve but adored. He parked by the chain-link fence where someone had tied scarves in team colors and where a handmade sign scolded: NO SLAPSHOTS DURING PUBLIC SKATE, which was the sort of rule this city wrote with affection that dared you to sulk.\n\nInside, the ice hissed gently under floodlights that were not quite up to the task, and a man in a jacket that bore the rink\u2019s crest approached as if hoping an electrician might also be a priest. \u201cThey\u2019re old ballasts,\u201d the man said, as if confessing that his house had dial-up internet. \u201cWe got a grant for half and then the rest was supposed to be bake sales, and then the bake sales became a fight about whether oatmeal counts as a cookie, which, frankly, it does not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will refrain from official rulings,\u201d Nate said, and looked up into the rafters with the squint of a man estimating both the cost and the stories. The metal housings had been installed in a rush sometime around the last millennium and had never forgiven anyone for it, and he could see where tape\u2014honest, earnest, foolish tape\u2014had been asked to serve as philosophy. He fetched his ladder from the van, the one with aluminum scuffs up its ribs from a winter\u2019s worth of Winnipeg interiors, and when he returned to the boards there were three dads and one mom already standing in formation because there is nothing about a rink that does not invite a person to be useful.\n\nHe let them hold the ladder because that was part of what had kept him human here\u2014hands under things, hands on rails, hands that did not pull but steadied. He climbed and coaxed the housings open with the measured sweetness of a man convincing a cornered cat to exit a cupboard. Behind him the rink\u2019s air carried the smell of old coffee and a child\u2019s wool hat and the particular metallic note of skates that have learned to take compliments. The ballasts had a sulk to them he recognized, the low, intermittent hum like a teenager preparing to apologize without ever intending to use the word sorry. He tapped and tightened and then replaced what needed replacing, and he did it with the mild ceremony he reserved for this sort of repair, because the repair mattered less than the theater of calm it brought with it and everyone in the stands needed that swallow of quiet as much as they needed light.\n\nWhen the fixtures came up, one and then three and then, grudgingly, five, the ice looked like it had forgiven the day. A cheer went up on the benches that was mostly children and partly adults who remembered, suddenly, being children, and the sound made him grin into the metal like a man being told by a stranger that the thing he loved about himself had been noticed. He came down the ladder to mitts offered in the shape of reward, paper cups pressed toward him like sacrament, coffee and chocolate in equal measure, and a woman in a toque with a pom-pom the size of a domestic cat said, \u201cYou fixed our winter,\u201d with a sincerity that should have embarrassed them all and did not.\n\nHe took his payment in a folded check that would not bounce and a dozen coupons for rink burgers that he suspected might be the kind of food that required youth to digest. He tucked the check into his wallet and the coupons into his pocket and let them make his hip feel like it had work to do, and he stood a minute longer at the boards to watch a boy in a red sweater gain the kind of balance that will make him trustworthy when he is fifteen. On his way out, the caretaker pressed a flyer into his hand and cocked his head like a bird asking if seed was still free. \u201cSpring Thaw Pie-Off is posting their judges on Friday,\u201d the man said, out of nowhere, as if gossip had moved up into the ducts. \u201cYou get to Toronto and back and the rumor is they might ask you to sit and nod and make pronouncements with a fork.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged the way men shrug when they have something small and excitable inside their chest and do not want the world to poke it. \u201cI have a face that can nod,\u201d he said. \u201cI practiced on trains.\u201d\n\nAt the Blue Goose later, Gertie had reorganized the front case so it faced the door with a belligerent prettiness. The pies were unapologetic circles dressed in golden armor, and there was a new sign bravely lettered by someone whose handwriting improved dramatically when they were told everyone would see it. SPRING THAW PATRON SAINTS, the top read, and then it listed names that were either legendary bakers or coworkers willing to be teased, and there, at the bottom, small and serious, was: N. KOWALSKY, LOCAL BOY, JAWS OF LIFE. He stood in the doorway with his hat in his hands and laughed, and the laugh eased something in him that had tightened on the drive into town when the sun took that watery angle between buildings that told you winter was eavesdropping.\n\n\u201cYou are a minor religion,\u201d Gertie said, from behind the counter, measuring cinnamon with the severity of a person ordering the behavior of stars. \u201cWe have candles. We have devotions. We do not yet have indulgences but we are working on it. Sit and tell me about the dome again, because I am a woman who can listen to the same story twelve times if the verbs behave.\u201d\n\nHe told her and didn\u2019t tell her, not because he was precious but because stories have layers and he wanted to let this one peel at its own pace. He told her about Jacques and his nose and his mother and doughnuts; he told her about the peppermint and about the boy with the cards; he told her he had fixed a light, and when he said that she made the kind of sound a person makes when listening to a wedding and someone says the right name. He didn\u2019t tell her about the way he had seen his mother\u2019s hands in his own when he steadied the ladder for the house tech in Toronto, because some things were best carried a while before being laid on a counter and offered as dessert, and he knew she would be there when he was ready to talk.\n\nBy the register, there was an envelope with his name on it in handwriting that knew the weight of a fountain pen. He raised his eyebrows and Gertie nodded like a magician refusing to reveal the mechanics. \u201cAgricultural Society,\u201d she said, as if she were saying the Saints or the Weather. \u201cHe said he is not finished interfering in your life, but only on months with an R in them.\u201d\n\nInside the envelope was a note on heavy paper that tried to be casual and fumbled, and a voucher from a local credit union with numbers on it he could read and pretend not to be amazed by. They wanted him to \u201chost\u201d a slice-and-sip night at the Fair\u2019s spring fundraiser, which turned out to be exactly what it sounded like\u2014adults with plastic cups of apple cider watching a man eat pie with technique, and then asking him questions about breath as if breath were a currency that might appreciate if they understood it. He felt, reading it, something that was not quite dread and not quite thrill but the good neighbor of both, the feeling you have when you walk out on thin ice you know to be trustworthy because you saw yesterday\u2019s footprints and the surface held.\n\nHe said yes of course in a way that implied he was a man who had been waiting for precisely this kind of absurdity. He marked the date in his book where he kept columns for what needed bolts and what needed talk. He had to finish the rink for the weekend, he had a laundry list of basements, he had the professional pleasure of a St. Vital bungalow whose owner had over-loved his dimmers until they became confessional, and amidst them all he now had to find a way to be a person who could stand in a room and let people look without deciding to hide behind a ladder. He could do it, he told himself, because he had done it, in an arena that smelled like caramel and judgment, and if he could do it there he could do it wearing a flannel shirt that had survived drywall.\n\nThe days installed themselves like switch plates. He pulled wire along joists in a crawlspace that had heard stories and kept them; he replaced a burnt-out breaker for a woman who insisted on giving him a mason jar of pickled beets as if electricity and beets could be stirred into the same stew and improve each other; he let a cat sniff his shoes and decide, finally, that he was not a threat, and the decision gratified him in a way he couldn\u2019t explain. Each night, the ribbon on his dresser nudged his eye and then let him look away, and some afternoons he would let his thumb slide the satin like a touch meant to confirm not pride but texture, and he thought of Jacques\u2019s punched tickets and the small snow of paper circles on the carpet.\n\nThere was weather, dramatic and unamused. A wet snow blew in on a Thursday, the kind that makes you understand why your boots exist, and then the temperature fell with the confidence of a headline. Winnipeg did what it always does\u2014it pulled its scarf up, it turned its face into wind in a posture of dignified defiance, it compensated. The calls that came in were a string of ordinary emergencies\u2014GFCIs that had decided fear would be their personality, furnace blowers that forgot their manners, basement lights that asked to be translated back into function\u2014and he spent a day moving from house to house like a stethoscope pressed to the city\u2019s chest, and he found he loved his day for its quiet competence. In the evening he got a text from an unknown number that turned out to be Moira, the braid woman, with a picture of a plate and a silver fork and the caption: Halifax insists we remain hungry, and he laughed because he understood what it was to be fond of a city and critical and to blend the two into a meal.\n\n\u201cJudges,\u201d Drew texted, with an attachment that was a PDF that had been designed by someone who believed in boxes. \u201cFriday noon. Wear scarves. There will be microphones. We\u2019ll be kind.\u201d\n\nHe told his mother because she had a right to know when her son\u2019s mouth had been officially invited to have opinions for a crowd. \u201cDo not wear black shirts,\u201d she said, practical and grave. \u201cIt makes crumbs look like confession. Wear blue so when you say wise things about crust people will believe you and also because it suits your eyes, even if you pretend you do not know this about yourself.\u201d He rolled his own eyes at himself for smiling and then did as he was told.\n\nHe walked to The Forks in a wind that had given up the argument for spring and opted instead to show everyone the shape of their cheeks. The festival had changed outfits, trading Saskatoon blues for the clean brown of butter and nuts, and the judges\u2019 table looked less like a stage and more like a long family argument with forks. He sat between a woman from a radio show who had opinions about nutmeg and the director of a local theater who had arrived with the body language of a man prepared to be surprised. Frankie slid him a clipboard with scoring rubrics that were both earnest and insane\u2014crust flake was a category, as was something called \u201cstructural moral argument,\u201d and he appreciated the city for tossing its weight behind a joke until the joke offered to pay rent. He took his job seriously in the sense that when he bit he closed his eyes because it felt impolite not to, and he described, when asked, a crust as \u201chonest work\u201d and a filling as \u201cthe right kind of apology,\u201d and afterward a woman in the crowd stopped him and said, \u201cI felt like you were talking about my ex-husband,\u201d which he did not know how to take and therefore took as a victory.\n\nOn the way home, he passed the municipal library where children were stacked in parkas on the carpet watching a man make shadow puppets convincing enough to make a ladybug terrifying. He cut down a side street where ice at the curb had decided it would be glass until June, and there he saw Mrs. Banerjee in a hat that made her look like a fancy teapot. The dog wore a sweater that might once have been a sock. She lifted her glove as if flagging a taxi, and in doing so accidentally signaled him to a stop.\n\n\u201cI saw you on the television,\u201d she said, and the way she said television made it sound like an oracle that resided in a cabinet. \u201cI am amused that we live in a society that will put a man under lights to discuss crust, and also I have notes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you do,\u201d he said, and bent to greet the dog, who pretended to tolerate him as part of a long con wherein one day Nate would be allowed to scratch the belly. \u201cDo I get a letter grade.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get an A when you remember that adjectives were invented by people who disapproved of nouns,\u201d she said, severe and fond. \u201cDo not be kind at the expense of truth. Also, your van door squeaks and everyone on this block believes it is the bird that starts spring at five thirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will oil it,\u201d he said. \u201cI will oil it with civic pride.\u201d\n\nShe narrowed her eyes and then smiled because it is difficult to remain stern when someone volunteers to improve a hinge for the common good. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cThe dog assumes spring is your fault and will ask you for an accounting when the snow returns on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nHe was halfway up his steps when his phone buzzed with a number that made him forget his key was in his hand. VIA RAIL, the screen declared with the impersonal punctuation of bureaucracy and the friendliness of a vacation timeline. He answered out of habit and curiosity, and a voice that could have belonged to any of the country\u2019s train stations said a series of words that lined up into a surprise\u2014customer appreciation, travel voucher, previous purchase, feedback call, random draw. He waited for a catch and could not find one except the kind that catches you at the sternum when life, at long intervals, conspires to repay you in symbols.\n\n\u201cWe have a voucher you may use within twelve months,\u201d the woman said, professional and ever so slightly pleased on his behalf. \u201cIt is our way of saying that time is not always an enemy and sometimes an ally, and that duct tape is not a solution on our trains but is perhaps a reasonable metaphor.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because he couldn\u2019t not, because the world had decided to be kind in a way that would be a story and he was in the mood for stories. He took the number and wrote it in his book with a pen that had been to Toronto and back, and he thought of Sudbury and the fox and Jacques and the napkin that purchased sorrow, and he felt that quiet expansion inside that is not joy exactly but is its cousin\u2014something like faith, except it involves fewer declarations.\n\nThe Fair\u2019s slice-and-sip turned out to be an event only a town that believes in itself could devise. There were twinkle lights and earnest chairs and paper plates printed with harvest scenes, and a man with a banjo in the corner making gentle noises so that the room would remember to smile. Nate stood with a plate and an absurdly long fork someone had lent him for theatrical effect, and at first he did the thing where he made small jokes to protect himself, and then he let the jokes go because he realized he had a room full of people who had decided to be generative rather than critical. He talked not about speed but about attention and about the discipline of breathing and about how he once had learned that strip, twist, cap was as close as he would get to a lullaby. He spoke about ladders, god help him, and the holding of them for other people, and midway through a sentence he saw a man in the back lower his head like someone who had just remembered being saved by something modest, and he knew he had said something true in public and not been punished.\n\nAfter, people came up with their questions and their stories and their auntie\u2019s recipes that required lard and a good marriage, and a girl of about seven with hair in the romantic state of perpetual tangles said, \u201cI want to be a fixer like you but with cakes,\u201d and he said, \u201cGood, then it will be easier to get invited to parties,\u201d and her mother laughed and he felt, with body-surety, that his city was a series of rooms where he could tell the truth about small things and not be corrected.\n\nWork continued to be a constellation of domestic dramas in need of practical endings. He went to a St. Boniface duplex where a new father had decided to rewire a nursery in the week before his child\u2019s arrival because mortality had arrived on the porch with a diaper bag, and he held the man\u2019s fear without putting his hands directly on it and showed him where to staple and where not to staple and said the words it is okay to hire help out loud so that the man would not have to extract his pride from under a refrigerator later. He went to a Norwood Park bungalow and installed under-cabinet lighting for a woman who had inherited her mother\u2019s cookbooks and had decided to live inside them for a while, and they talked about cardamom like it was a plot twist that proves the writer knows what she\u2019s doing. He went to a bank\u2019s back office where the breaker panel had been labeled by someone with a sense of humor and no handwriting, and he hung new labels and made them boring on purpose so that no one would one day pull the wrong thing in a hurry because whimsy had been allowed to masquerade as a schematic.\n\nHe heard from \u00c9lodie in a message full of abbreviations and exclamation marks that read like a song, and she sent him a picture of her with an elderly woman in a kitchen where the counter had seen tomatoes for fifty years, and she wrote, we\u2019re starting a youth pie club because why not and because teens should have knife skills and lungs, and he wrote back with a sincerity that did not feel like an intrusion, and he sent her a picture of the rink under lights with skate lines like a secret language. Moira mailed him a peppermint because some people take a bit and make it a ritual, and when he opened the envelope his kitchen smelled briefly like a gift shop in a town with an ethic.\n\nOn a Wednesday he drove out of town on a job whose address included the name of a road that had not decided whether it wanted to be gravel or virtue. A farmer had called, an older couple who had the voices of two people who had been weathered into kindness by work, and their barn\u2019s wiring made the man\u2019s nephew, an apprentice welder, nervous. He trundled up a drive that had ruts like biographies and parked by a house that had, over the years, been added to and apologized for in equal measure. The barn stood like a solemn animal and inside it the light swung from a beam where a swallow would be a minister come summer. He found splices that had been emergency solutions in an era when emergencies lasted decades, and he found cobwebs so dense he felt he owed them rent, and he replaced and tightened and put in a GFCI where a handwashing sink had been added and ignored by the gods. The farmer\u2019s wife brought him coffee so strong it could have worked nights, and she knew the names of the cats by sight and of the cows by hoof, and she told him about the time the hydro had gone out and the milk had not and how they had relied on the fussy diesel generator like a cousin who could be counted on to complain while saving your life.\n\nHe finished at twilight when the fields around them had returned to their idea of themselves\u2014flat with insistence, not empty but ready. The farmer gave him a sack of potatoes because payment comes in many shapes here, and as he drove back to the city the sky did a performance of colors that would have embarrassed the Pacific, and he thought about the voucher sitting in his book and the trains that would cut this very field in a line you could navigate by if the sun forgot you. He did not know where he would go, not exactly, but the ticket felt like a sentence you put on your tongue to practice saying it without flinching: I can leave and I can come back, and both are mine.\n\nHe was at the Blue Goose the next morning, because some mornings belonged to rituals and raisin toast and opinions spoken over sugar. Gertie had put out a pie that looked like a hymn, lattice so careful it could have passed inspection at a parade, and he ate without rushing because the hour did not stare at him. A boy at the counter that he did not recognize and yet knew\u2014ridiculous hoodie, eyes that were part suspicion and part offer\u2014watched him with the curiosity of someone deciding which older men were allowed in the neighborhood of their hopes. \u201cYou the pie guy,\u201d the boy said, not a question but not an accusation either, and Nate, because he had decided somewhere between Sudbury and home that he would not be stingy with joy even when addressed by its teenage dialect, said, \u201cI am a man who did a ridiculous thing and was rewarded with a ribbon, yes.\u201d\n\nThe boy considered and then nodded as if awarding legitimacy. \u201cCool,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was dumb and then my aunt was like, no, this is community, and I was like, okay, and then I cried a little but I will not talk about that here.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Nate said, and lifted his mug in a salute to the great emotional economy of small admissions. \u201cWhen you want to talk about it not here, find me, because that is also community.\u201d\n\nHe left the diner with a pie for his mother wrapped in paper that had been driven crazy by cinnamon, and he walked up his block under a sky that had finally, finally decided to learn brightness again, and he could feel the city lifting half an inch with him, because when the cold lets go there is a humility to the air that makes you forgive your own fingers. The van door squeaked once to remind him he owned oil and then stopped because he owned oil. He mounted the steps and found, tucked into the corner of his storm door like a confession, an envelope with a Calgary postmark and a handwriting like a man trying to behave and failing gracefully. Inside was a postcard with a picture of the world\u2019s largest perogy, which was a joke that did not know whether to be affectionate or ashamed, and Ty had written on the back: man, the kids at the gym made me eat blueberry protein \u201cpie\u201d and it was a crime; I told them you\u2019re the guy who would hold a ladder for a stranger and that is what heroes are; you coming west one day, you have a couch here and a pie club that wears weights. He propped the card against his salt shaker and wondered at the way the world had enlarged itself around him without demanding that he be louder.\n\nThat evening, after his calls had been logged and his receipts shoved into the diplomatic pouch of a man\u2019s pockets, Raj came by with beer and a story about a client who had paid him in a painting of her late dachshund and a bowl of grapes. They sat on the floor because the couch was still a project he had not finished budgeting for, and they leaned their heads back against the wall like kids who had ditched class and somehow ended up in a sanctified space. \u201cYou have a voucher,\u201d Raj said, and said it with the satisfaction of a man for whom instruments of mobility were almost erotic. \u201cWe are a people of coupons and opportunity. Where do you want to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot west,\u201d Nate said, because he had already arranged for west to be a later gift. \u201cMaybe east and not Toronto, something smaller. A town where trains are not an event but a pulse. Or north a little, where the trees remember things I do not. Or maybe nowhere and then somewhere when the word shows up on my tongue and fits.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Raj said. \u201cI enjoy that travel can be grammatical. You know, the dog wore a paper crown the day you won because Mrs. Banerjee did not have a ribbon and decided that monarchy could stand in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope she burned the crown when the snow came back,\u201d Nate said, and they both watched the window where their reflections sat with them like sudden guests, thin and earnest. For a time they were quiet the way men are quiet when love is too large for language but under no threat, and then they began the chew of trivialities again because triviality is sometimes how you protect what matters.\n\nWhen the call came on Friday, he was in a utility room in a building that smelled like old plants and new promises, and he let it go to voicemail because breakers do not like to be ignored in their hour of need. Later, in the van, he pressed the triangle and listened to Drew explain in his familiar blend of authority and invitation that the National Sweet had decided to film a special about \u201cregional saints\u201d and wanted to come to Winnipeg and ask him to help them not make a fool of themselves. \u201cWe are good at reverence,\u201d Drew said, words crisp and amused. \u201cThey are good at cameras. Let\u2019s see if we can make a meal that won\u2019t embarrass the aunts.\u201d\n\nHe stared at the windshield for an extravagant number of seconds because his brain was busy organizing itself into yes. He thought about his town\u2019s patience, about how cameras can be both magnifying and cruel, about the way he could put his body between a camera and something truly tender and say you may look but you will not take. He thought about the lights at the rink and the peppermint and the way \u00c9lodie had not softened her face until praise required it, and he thought that perhaps what he had been practicing all winter\u2014breath and stance and the permission to be joyful about small absurdities\u2014had been a rehearsal for a thing he had not named. He dialed and said yes in a voice that sounded like someone tightening a screw to the exact snugness it needed, and then he put the van in gear and joined the afternoon the way you join a crowd that is moving in a direction you are happy to be going, admiring the coats, making sure your own zipper is up, grateful for elbows and for the way your city knows your stride.",

                              "content": "Chapter 9\n\nThe film crew arrived on a Wednesday that looked like it had practiced its sincerity in the mirror. The snowbanks had been cut down into low gray loaves, the gutters were muttering to themselves with purpose, and geese flew overhead like punctuation, correcting the sentences winter had written all over the river. The email had called them a unit\u2014production unit, as if they were a battalion\u2014but the people who stepped off the shuttle and into the light had the look of individuals who had learned to share snacks and grudges on long drives. The showrunner was named Tessa and wore a coat like an intention. The cameraman, Lionel, had knees that told you he\u2019d crouched in the cold for a living, and a lens he touched the way other men touched heirlooms, careful and amused at the attention they were getting for their care. Yasmin, the sound op, had hair that dared the wind to try and was the sort of person who says hello to a building\u2019s exterior before going in. Behind them all trailed a young person in a wool hat with a clipboard\u2014the universal badge of someone\u2019s newness and competence\u2014whose name was Courtney and who chewed on the cap of a pen with the concentration of a squirrel saving up character.\n\nDrew met them with a laminated schedule and the calm of a person who knew how to move authority around until it looked like a friendly party. He pointed at Nate as if presenting a tool he was especially proud of. \u201cOur local,\u201d he said, which sounded like a role and also like something a bar keeps on tap for loyalists. Tessa shook Nate\u2019s hand and did the quick, efficient scan of a face that television people did, assessing angles, comfort, the likelihood a person will collapse into adjectives. \u201cWe want to show your city as itself,\u201d she said, and he heard the italics and did not resent them because at least she knew italics existed. \u201cWe want the room to feel like the room. Help us not build a bad prairie diorama. Help us not embarrass the aunts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can be a very bossy nephew,\u201d he said, and she laughed and then looked relieved when he didn\u2019t take the joke farther than necessary.\n\nThey had a list of locations that began as guesswork and ended as a map only someone who lived here could draw. The Blue Goose, of course, because you don\u2019t make a show about sugar in this city and ignore the room where opinions were plated and the coffee was more policy than beverage. The community rink in St. James, where the lights had been saved from their own drama and where children learned to wobble into competence under a ceiling that had not fallen in anyone\u2019s lifetime. His mother\u2019s kitchen had been proposed and retired gently because his mother had said on the phone, in the tone of someone directing traffic at a parade, that cameras would eat her curtains and she did not have new curtains to feed them. She would allow her hands, though, and a bowl, and what she called \u201cthe part of my forearm where you can see the life I have lived,\u201d and the sound op had said she could work with that and made a note that read hands/forearm/soup in block letters because sometimes you have to say exactly what you mean to the future.\n\nThey began at the diner because that was the kind of statement television liked\u2014place and person, smell of cinnamon pretending to be narrative, the visual generosity of glass cases. Gertie stood behind the counter with a posture she normally reserved for the mayor and people who attempted to bargain down the cost of lemon meringue. She had put on earrings that might have been small golden pies or, depending on your faith, suns. The crew did the introductions with the careful humility of people entering a kitchen they did not own. Tessa began to explain what they wanted and Gertie lifted a hand delicately, palm open like an air traffic instruction.\n\n\u201cYou will not put jaunty music over my pies,\u201d she said, with the crispness of a kitchen towel snapped into purpose. \u201cYou will not call me an institution as if I were a building that pretends to not crave repainting. You may ask me about butter and I will tell you truths you can live by, and you may ask me about men who think pie is a hobby and I will tell you a different set of truths that you may decide are unairable. You will eat and you will not put your fork down on the plate with the tines facing up because we are not animals.\u201d\n\nYasmin\u2019s mouth did the quick gymnastics of someone suppressing a laugh because she had learned to treat sound the way a librarian treats quiet. Tessa nodded, throat working, the way a person nods when they realize they\u2019ve been handed the manual for the equipment they have just plugged in without reading the manual. \u201cNo jaunty music,\u201d she said. \u201cNo institutions. Butter and men as subjects. Fork etiquette. Understood.\u201d\n\nNate watched the exchange with the pleasure of a man who had been asked to be useful and found the work being done for him by someone who had more glamorous verbs. He took Lionel to the back to show him where he could get a shot of the ovens without also getting a shot of the mop bucket, because documentary truth did not require audiences to know the color of the mop water. He taped down cables with the gentle roughly of someone who had spent a winter falling over the wrong things, and he moved one of the suppler power bars off a circuit that also powered the ice cream freezer, because a scoop\u2019s noble work need not be imperiled by television.\n\nThey chased light that day like responsible thieves. Tessa wanted a shot of the river path and the warming huts, those small pieces of art that appeared on the ice each year like confidence. The trail had turned into a memory with a half-life and the signs had gone up advising people who weren\u2019t from here to be their best selves and stay off. Nate made a call to a friend of Raj\u2019s who worked with the festival that brought the huts and secured permission to film one dragged up on land, tilted like a question. They loaded pies like relics and staged an argument between pies and weather, and it looked better on screen than anyone expected, which is how this city rewarded persistence: not with drama, but with a kind of crooked cooperativeness.\n\nAt the rink, the caretaker smiled like a man evaluating suitors and pointed at the paper sign about slapshots, which someone had fortified with glitter and conviction. Parents had been warned; forms had been printed and actual pens had been found. Children skated as if they were being filmed by a kind god and then forgot the camera existed and became their knees again. The crew wanted a sequence of the lights coming on, the way rooms change when illumination remembers itself, and Nate told them he would not fake the flicker. He would not stand people in a fabricated darkness so that their joy could be manufactured. He asked the caretaker to hit the switch at the natural hour and they waited in the seam time between gray and blaze, breathing into their mitts. When the lights came, three and one and then the rest in their obedient train, the rink made a kind of sound that didn\u2019t need microphones. Yasmin checked her levels anyway and Lionel grinned through his viewfinder as if he\u2019d been given permission to keep the contentment.\n\nThere were moments when the show tried to be a show and the city tried to be a city and Nate had to wedge himself between the two to make introductions more polite. At Union Station, the production wanted a shot of him in profile under the arch, looking like a man cultivates myth in his spare time. There was no train that hour, only a maintenance crew with carts and common sense, and someone suggested the Railway Museum as a stand-in with better angles. He shook his head because the performative image of a man with a ticket and an expression would not be truer for being prettier. He pointed out, instead, a small corner by the coffee kiosk where the sun shot a ribbon across the floor at ten thirty and made anyone who walked through it look like a lead in a movie about decency. They filmed him there, buying a coffee and not spilling it, nodding to the kind woman who tucked his change with the grace of practice into a dish, and the clip would later make people write to the show and say that they had, themselves, been there at ten thirty on a Wednesday and had felt better for it, and could they buy that feeling somewhere.\n\nHis mother agreed to hands, and to forearm, and to a bowl that had cracked and been mended, and the camera loved her the way cameras love people who do not ask to be looked at. She wore an apron with a pattern of cherries that had seen more grease than church, and she let flour be flour and not a symbol. Elastic dough flopped with the sound of a thing willing to be worked, and her voice, when it came as an invitation to the ear and not the eye, made even the clipboard-pen keepers stand still. She told a story about learning to say the word for stove in English and saying store by mistake and ending up with a bag that smelled like rubber and choices. Tessa asked permission, quietly, to use her line about media being a mirror that distorts because it is a mirror, and his mother said she could use it if she also added that sometimes mirrors are for checking if your teeth have parsley in them and this is a kindness. They laughed, and Lionel\u2019s camera made gentle confessions about where it liked to stand.\n\nThere was one moment\u2014the fight had to arrive somewhere\u2014when someone from production, an assistant to a person who had not come to Winnipeg because they were guarding a spreadsheet in Toronto, sent notes that suggested they stage a scene of winter hardship by frosting an exterior window and having Nate scrape it in a way that aligned with a sentimental narrative about ruggedness. \u201cWe can blow snow,\u201d Tessa said, apologetic already, holding up her phone with the email on it like a curse she had not sworn. \u201cWe can suggest marrow-stiffening adversity. They want grit. Grit sells.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have grit,\u201d he said, and did not mean the show kind. \u201cBut frost is not a metaphor until you\u2019ve watched your own breath hang in a hallway because the furnace fan died and you have five minutes to decide whether to learn or to call. We have perfectly serviceable adversity. We don\u2019t need to counterfeit it. Let me show you a lever that sticks unless you talk to it right. Let me introduce you to the sound the ice makes when it\u2019s lying about its integrity. Let me tell your camera to wait with us at a bus stop when the sign says fifteen minutes and the wind says thirty. Or we can point the lens at a bowl of soup and admit that heat is a kind of miracle.\u201d\n\nYasmin nodded the way people nod when an argument sets itself down with its weight where it belongs. Tessa put her phone back in her coat and changed the plan by not writing the change down. The fake frost did not happen. They recorded his hands on a real lever and the lever, flattered by the attention, behaved, and the part of the audience that had grown up in houses with levers wrote later to say thank you for not telling lies about their childhoods.\n\nThe only real crisis of the week had a smell\u2014ozone and anxiety. At the Blue Goose on Friday, halfway through a setup for a shot that would involve pie cooling on a sill like a fairy tale that had decided to be practical, a circuit popped somewhere in the subtle geometry of the building and half the front room\u2019s lights narrowed themselves for a debate about whether illumination should be optional. The coffee machine made a sound like a polite cough that refuses to escalate to a scene. Lionel looked up at the ceiling with the instinct of a man who had forgotten his luck was dependent on electrons. Gertie put her hands on her hips as if rearranging them might rearrange modernity. The show\u2019s gaffer, who was there to wrangle light in an elevated sense and not to negotiate with a caf\u00e9\u2019s secret temper, peered into a junction box with the brave disinterest of someone smelling another trade\u2019s territory.\n\nNate had already moved. He crouched behind the counter with the familiarity of a cousin who knows where the holiday cutlery is kept and popped the panel to see that a breaker had done its job and that the job had been discouraging. He chased the line with his eyes and then with his hands, skirting the capacious talent Gertie\u2019s cappuccino machine had for drama, and found the offender\u2014an outlet frame that had been tightened one corner at a time, seduced into a short by someone who meant well in a century that did not belong to them. He loosened, reseated, tightened in order, soothing the metal with the patience of a man who had learned that speed was a trickster. The lights returned without pomp, and the coffee machine made a noise like gratitude converting itself into crema.\n\nLionel\u2019s camera had caught the moment they didn\u2019t know to stage: knees on old tile, hands competent without needing to be performed as such, the spontaneous chorus of a room that had not been left in the dark. Later, when Tessa asked him if they could use it as a metaphor, he made a face that was not entirely kind and then nodded because it was also true. He extracted a quiet promise that they would balance it with shots that insisted women\u2019s hands and old tools and the kid at the dish pit also held up the day, and she agreed without giving him a speech about story arcs because she was a person who wanted to be invited to good dinners.\n\nIt was not all crisis avoidance and ethical wrangling. There were the small pleasures that make collaboration feel like a picnic instead of a committee\u2014Courtney learning to order a coffee in a blend of French and boldness in St. Boniface and the barista giving her an extra biscuit because she used merci like a kiss; Lionel showing a teenager how to hold a camera without letting it hold him; Yasmin taping a tiny microphone into Gertie\u2019s sleeve with the gentle efficiency of a nurse convinced of your recovery. There was Raj rolling through in a sweater the color of moral persuasion with baked samosas for the crew and a story about a client who had stored heirloom tomatoes in a filing cabinet. There was Mrs. Banerjee pausing on her walk past the Goose to inform the production that their van was parked as if reconsidering the right to be a van, and the piece of equipment was moved without anyone needing to say words like zone or City of Winnipeg in a tone.\n\nThey filmed a slice of her forearm and a teaspoon hitting the side of a cup and a bell over the door making a small decision to be charming. They filmed at the rink and used the sound of skates to transition between scenes instead of a jingle, and the editor in Toronto would later call Drew and say, surprised, that ice had rhythm. They filmed Nate at his van, heater wheezing nobly, drawers opened to reveal the OCD of a man whose peace involved labeling, and Tessa laughed out loud and told him to stop apologizing with his eyebrows for being neat. He apologized anyway and then stopped, chastened into practice.\n\nOn the last day, weather remembered it had power and brought a thaw that turned intersections into hypotheses. The plan had been to catch the golden hour by the river, camera low, wheat sheaf on his bib from Toronto lent to him again by the Agricultural Society because they believed in second uses. The river, pale and deceptive, sounded like a bar where someone had brought in a musician without telling the regulars. The crew wanted the shot of his city being itself and his feet moving through it in a way that would rhyme with the footage of him in Toronto in his hotel room holding a ribbon like a small absurdity. The ice dared them to be fools. He was not in the mood for foolishness that hurt, only for foolishness that healed, so he led them under the canopy by the market where the wind was banned by consensus and stood there instead, watching people move in bundles and pairs, carrying bread and hockey sticks and the afternoon inside their coats.\n\n\u201cTalk,\u201d Tessa said, softly, as if asking him to tell a story to a kid already asleep but faking it because they wanted more. \u201cTalk about what you would like us to take home from here.\u201d\n\nHe could have spoken about the ease of order, about his binding love of strip, twist, cap, about the way a switch that clicks with authority feels like a promise kept. He could have mentioned foxes and napkins and ladders in snack bars, and he almost did. What came out, instead, was something simpler, the way words are simpler when you realize you\u2019re not auditioning for anything.\n\n\u201cI want you to take home the fact that joy happens in dumb places,\u201d he said. \u201cIn rinks where dads argue about oatmeal cookies and a breaker decides to be dramatic and someone says no to a staged frost because we already have the weather we need. I want you to know that when people here appear understated it\u2019s sometimes a choice and sometimes it\u2019s the wind. I want you to film our hands and not just our faces. And if someone at a table tells you a story about butter, you need to listen because they are not talking about butter.\u201d\n\nLionel lowered the camera slightly and then raised it again because cameras are as susceptible to embarrassment as people are. Yasmin shifted her feet on the concrete to warm her toes and nodded just enough to say go on. He did, but only until the words finished, which they did of their own accord, like a good piece of electrical tape running out at exactly the right point on a wrap.\n\nBy the time they packed the last cable, the city had turned down its day and put on a coat of evening that made everyone look like a better version of themselves for just long enough to remember they could be. The crew went back to their hotel to argue gently over footage while eating something with a price that could be justified to a boss, and Nate walked to the Goose because he wanted to see if the day had left any crumbs behind. Gertie gave him a slice of pie without ceremony and a look like a confession you never have to pay for. He ate seated on the stool at the end like a man who had decided to be present for his own life and was seeing if it would allow him.\n\nOn his way home, his phone buzzed with a text from Moira. It was a picture of a mint on a saucer next to a folded program from a funeral, and her message was a handful of words without fat. Gran went gentle. Peppermint for ballast. He stopped and leaned against a mailbox the color of uncompromising and wrote back what he knew how to say\u2014how her braid had done good work in a room that was too loud and how ladders had been held for him and how he would think of her grandmother when he taught anyone to breathe through a moment that wanted you to do anything but. She wrote a heart, which felt insufficient and perfect, and he put his phone in his pocket.\n\nWhen he turned the corner onto his street, Mrs. Banerjee was out with the dog, who was wearing a new sweater that declared in block letters I HAVE OPINIONS. She lifted her mitten in salute, and he lifted his chin in return, and it was a rite conducted in the decent light of a day that had offered itself and been accepted. He oil-can\u2019d the van door once for the pleasure of proving to her he had listened and the hinge agreed with him. Upstairs, his kitchen had the quiet of a friend who had done the dishes while you were out and wanted you to notice without making a fuss. On the dresser, the ribbon sat with the voucher, a still life of possible directions.\n\nHe made tea in the good mug because he wanted to send himself a message about value. He sat at the table and flipped open his book to where he kept the unglamorous invoices and the glamorous doodles he made during hold music. He drew a ladder and then a pie and then a little cartoon light, and then he wrote at the top of a page: Fixers and Bakers, and underlined it, a cheap ambition made already better by ink. He drew boxes for dates and names, spaces for kids from Raj\u2019s art programs and teens Gertie had inevitably charmed and the boy at the counter who had changed his mind about silly things. He thought about the rink and a lying light and a Saskatchewan fox that had agreed to be seen, about trains and the way time lengthens when you\u2019re kind to it. He thought about Churchill and the north and how his voucher might be a sentence waiting for its verb, and he knew he didn\u2019t have to know yet. He could let that be a window he would open when the air itself asked.\n\nBefore bed, he called his mother to tell her that the crew had been kind and that the curtains remained unfed, and she hummed and asked whether the director had worn boots or only thought about boots and whether the world had stopped being impressed by his neat truck. He answered her in enough detail to let her picture his day and not so much that she would worry about the ice. He lay down and felt the city breathe around him, a big lunged animal that was happy to share oxygen. He let sleep arrive the way it arrives when you have not fought it\u2014without bargains, without apology. Outside, on the boulevard, the snow made one last attempt at sparkle and then gave up on theatrics, content to be ordinary under streetlight. In the morning, he would take his ladder to a house with baseboards that dreamed of being younger and he would flip a switch and something would yield to the idea of light, and that would be enough, and when he had time he would build a room where kids could learn how to breathe and to fix and to never be stingy with joy.",

The day spent itself on indecision\u2014sun that arrived with apology and left with flourish, a wind that tried on three accents before settling on the one that made noses sting. The Blue Goose had announced a watch-along with the matter-of-fact bravado of a place that had survived weddings, wakes, and a brief experiment with gluten-free puff pastry that Gertie insisted had been necessary for science. She taped a handwritten note to the door\u2014TELEVISION TONIGHT, NO JAUNTY MUSIC PERMITTED\u2014and set out bowls of peanuts as if preparing the diner for the weight of a city\u2019s attention.\n\nHe finished a job in a house where the baseboards wanted to be younger and the owners wanted dimmers that performed mood without melodrama, and he got to the Goose early because punctuality had revealed itself to him as a form of devotion. The place filled with the slow confidence of regulars plus cousins plus people who had only ever waved in and now found a reason to sit. You could tell the shy from the curious by the way they looked at the TV. The shy looked at the frame. The curious looked at the corners as if to catch the room off guard and thus more honest. Raj arrived with a bag of samosas he had no business calling a contribution and took up a post near the coffee urn as if caffeine required shepherding. Mrs. Banerjee occupied her usual stool with the air of a magistrate conducting an open hearing, the dog at home because crowds turned him into a critic.\n\nThe episode began in the modest way TV sometimes remembers to be modest. A train\u2019s window, a snow-bent field, a voiceover that didn\u2019t try to seduce anyone. There was Lionel\u2019s shot of the rink lights finding their courage, and the crowd in the Goose cheered lightly for their own children and then more loudly for their own light, and the sound hit Nate right at the sternum where his better decisions lived. Gertie appeared on screen with earrings like promises and laid out her commandments without committee. In the diner, men who had played hockey with her brother forty years ago slapped the counter and said there she is like a hymn. His mother\u2019s hands came next, the forearm with its good history, the bowl that had been mended and had decided not to be shy about it, and a silence arrived\u2014one you could taste, respectful and hungry\u2014and when her voice broke for one sentence and recovered it, the room breathed together, a lung of people who had been raised by women with aprons and opinions.\n\nHe felt the suspense that comes, for only a second, when you are about to see your own face unmediated. He had the impulse to duck behind a pie display and let the room see him in their periphery while he counted bolts of fear. He did not move. He watched himself dodge the camera\u2019s worst habits by standing near a coffee kiosk at ten thirty and doing what he always did, which was to be polite and take exact change and say thank you to something that spent itself on you without expecting praise. He saw his hands on the Goose\u2019s panel when the breaker had done its duty and needed to be told to do it again, and he saw the expression on his own mouth that meant focus and not performance, and he recognized the tilt of his head that had belonged to him since childhood when screws and sorrow had required equal torque.\n\nThe show did what it promised\u2014it made room, it did not sneer, it treated the city\u2019s rooms as if they were not backdrops but participants. There was a moment with the warming hut dragged onto land, a pie on a table in the wind, Tessa\u2019s voice absent in favor of the sound the river made promising to get on with it already, and in the Goose there was the particular sniffing sound men make when they will not admit to crying because their eyes have simply chosen this moment to be weather stations. At the end, Lionel\u2019s lens had lingered on a hand on a shoulder\u2014Drew\u2019s, not dramatic, not claiming ownership\u2014just weight shared. The screen went to credits and then to a commercial for insurance that had the gall to make a joke, and the diner finally did what it had been holding in reserve. It erupted, not in a roar but in the sort of chatter that means everyone has been waiting to be generous and now can be. People clapped for each other in the laconic prairie manner that still counts as rapture.\n\nGertie did not bow, on principle, but she looked at him over the counter and let her smile run without a leash. \u201cAcceptable,\u201d she said, and slid him a slice of pie with no desire to be coy. \u201cNo jaunty music.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won,\u201d he said, because accuracy is a kindness.\n\n\u201cWe all did, except the man at the network who suggested frost machines,\u201d she replied, and wiped her hands as if that could erase an entire genre of television thoughtlessness. \u201cHe will live a long and joyless life, his coffee always slightly wrong.\u201d\n\nPeople came to his elbow and told him tiny stories about their own trains, about their own lights, about their own hands. A woman from the school board somewhere in the river of conversation said, \u201cWe saw the bit at the end where you talked about kids and breathing and ladders. If you need space for a Saturday, we have a gym where the light switches have been pinned back from the eighties and a janitor who will look the other way if he\u2019s invited to judge pie.\u201d She handed him a card that had an actual phone number printed on it and a name underlined with someone\u2019s exasperation. He put it in his pocket in the way you put a spare key in your sock.\n\nHe got outside before the compliments turned into a stew he could not digest. The air did him the favor of being honest. Raj followed with the last samosa wrapped in a napkin as if it were a rare bird, and they stood on the sidewalk watching the city do its after-dinner rearrangements. \u201cThey loved you,\u201d Raj said, smug on behalf of a plan that had birthed itself into a life. \u201cThey loved the forearm more.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey should,\u201d he said. \u201cI am still auditioning for my role. The forearm has tenure.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re starting this thing,\u201d Raj said, blunt because friendship is a hammer when required. \u201cYou are going to call it what you wrote down and it will not be a secret from me that you are terrified. I\u2019ve lined up a notary and a woman named Flor who says the words \u2018small grant\u2019 the way choir directors say \u2018one more time, but with feeling.\u2019 Your job is to show up with screws and breath and the morally correct triangle of strip, twist, cap.\u201d\n\nThe first session of Fixers and Bakers did not so much begin as gather around itself, like dough deciding whether or not to rise based on the oven\u2019s attitude. The borrowed gym wore its echoes like a uniform. He and Raj arrived early because tables needed dragging and outlets needed negotiating, and someone had to put masking tape arrows on the floor because children require a geography even when they have no intention of obeying it. Gertie came in backward through the side door carrying two sheet pans that made the hallway smell like sincerity. She had brought hand pies the size of apologies and a stack of paper plates recycled from a church basement. Two high schoolers from Raj\u2019s art program arrived with a box of donated screwdrivers, each tagged with a ribbon as if to prove to the tools that they had been acquired in joy. The Agricultural Society\u2019s man appeared with a thermos that could have heated a church and the amount of apple cider that made people confess.\n\nThe kids came the way kids always come\u2014in erratic clumps, carrying grudges and hopes, dragged by aunties or followed by older brothers who would pretend boredom for three entire minutes before wanting a turn. There was the boy from the Goose who had discovered publicly that he could cry at a silly thing, chin forward now like a pilot\u2019s, and there was a girl whose hair made a case for static electricity as a personality trait. A mom with the calm of those who have negotiated with toddlers brought her son who wore soundproof headphones like a crown and whose eyes went to the ladder as if to name it family. He had required waivers printed and signed because the world asked you to avoid drama where possible, and he had fretted about the word being the enemy of joy, but the structure turned out to be a friend. Mrs. Banerjee arrived late, a stack of peppermints in her pocket, and declared herself a safety inspector with an assistant\u2014her dog\u2014whose sweater that day read SMALL BUT PUBLIC.\n\nHe began with breath because breath would serve them when everything else jangled. He made them stand with feet ready and hands on their own ribs and he told a story that contained no moral because the point was practice. Then he showed them a switch plate and the insides behind and laid out the words of his lullaby. Strip, twist, cap. He said it twice, soft as bedtime, and the room gave him the gift of quiet. Gertie demonstrated the parallel in dough\u2014cut, crimp, vent\u2014and winked at him as if they had planned it, which they had not, because some things are pre-arranged by the part of the universe in charge of parallels.\n\nThey split the kids into groups even though groups made him itchy. It had to be done because otherwise the smallest elbows would find the worst sockets. He took the older ones, the ones with the swagger that required a tool to settle it, and gave them a dead lamp and a box of wire nuts and asked them to bring it back from the border. Raj took the younger ones and taught them how to hold a screwdriver without letting the screwdriver hold them, and he spoke in metaphors that did not apologize for being metaphors. Gertie set the hand pies out with the severity of portion control and then undid all her own rules when a child\u2019s eyes told a more persuasive story about hunger.\n\nThere was a moment he had not expected and now would not have traded for a year\u2019s worth of ribbons. A girl with sleeves long enough to hide in had been hovering with that particular studied indifference that hides terror. She held her screwdriver as if it were a snake a magician had made polite. When he came to her table, she did not look up because eyes were traitors, but her hands told a better story. He showed her how to twist with the steadiness that convinces wire it is not being punished, and she followed, and when the two copper ends married under her fingers she made a sound that was not the delighted squeal television asks of girls but a short, grave exhale. He wanted to bow to her competence. He did not. He said, calmly, \u201cYou did that,\u201d and she said, as if reporting to an internal tribunal, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThey had been going an hour when the gym did the thing buildings do around the ninety-minute mark of children\u2014the lights hiccuped once in solidarity. It was not a crisis, more of a throat clear. The janitor, a man of jokes disguised as frowns, ambled over to the panel and made the gesture people make when they want to help but have learned that touching often makes the situation into more of itself. Nate went with him, because being helpful without owning the room is a skill he was finally proud to have acquired. The breakers were labeled admirably by someone who wrote as if labels prevented chaos in all domains. One was loose in its seat, an old friend he recognized. He reseated it with the pressure that says I mean it and not I dare you, and the room decided to keep being a room.\n\nNose-smudged cups traveled through the hour, laughter did the honorable labor of making time quick, and the dog, who disliked the echo of gymnasium acoustics on principle, settled under the table with his sweater proclaiming his smallness as a form of protest. Moira appeared on the phone via Raj\u2019s projector like a saint on a stained-glass window, her screen frozen into humor and then resolving. She waved her peppermint at the camera in solemn greeting and taught them an unreasonably useful trick for keeping crust edge from shrinking back on itself, and somewhere in the back the janitor, thinking he was out of range of education, tilted his head and listened as if pie lore were a trade secret he could translate into mopping. \u00c9lodie sent a video that played sideways because the universe makes a point of reminding us amateurs are still powerful, and in it she was ankle-deep in slush outside a community center in Rouyn-Noranda, declaring pie club a success because teens had arrived and nobody had set fire to anything except sugar on purpose.\n\nAfter the cider and the goodbyes and a ritual argument about whether there should be homework\u2014no, unless homework came in the form of breathing\u2014after the janitor had admitted with a gallantry that nearly killed him that the room had not been made worse by this intrusion, after Gertie had tucked three hand pies into a napkin and forced it into the coat of the shy girl \u201cfor your mother or for yourself depending on guilt,\u201d after Raj had listed at least six ideas that required both money and a belief in spare hours he did not have, after all that, he stood in the empty gym with a broom, sweeping confetti of wire clippings and paper plate shrapnel into a pile that looked briefly like an emblem of something he could not name. He loved a broom for its honesty. You ask it for order and it gives you little neat hills of evidence.\n\nOutside, late afternoon had flattened into that Winnipeg gray that makes you honest with yourself by removing all flattery. He had two hours until a call from Flor to confirm something about municipal insurance that had the word indemnify in it and made him itch in parts of his body paperwork rarely reached. He took the long way back toward his van because long ways tame adrenaline. Past the park where the snow had worn itself thin and the garbage cans were making unreasonable requests of passersby. Past a garage whose door was open to reveal a man tenderly repainting a bicycle as if it were a shrine. Past the kid\u2019s fort, the pizza-box sign updated for the season\u2014NO DOGS WHO BARK AT FORTS AND NO ADULTS WHO THINK RULES ARE SUGGESTIONS\u2014and he saluted it in his head because he had finally become the adult who did not think rules were suggestions except in cases involving kind shortcuts.\n\nHe still needed a space. A place that belonged to the thing, not borrowed in good will and kindly janitorial anxiety. He had been circling a vacancy listing for weeks, a former print shop just off Portage that had been empty long enough to lower its price and its pride. He had talked himself out of it four times and then back in three. Today the version of himself that believed in commitment was in charge. He drove over and parked, looked at the brick with its winter scabs, at the windows that had long ago surrendered to decals promising rush jobs and wedding invitations. The door stuck at the bottom like it had lost faith in coming and going as a model. Inside, the air had the stale optimism of spaces that remember machines. Dust lay on everything with the entitlement of poor landlords.\n\nIt was perfect the way damaged things are perfect when they can be repaired. Room enough for tables, a back corner that could be roped off for the ladder and the tools that wanted to be behind a line. An alcove that could hold a secondhand oven if the fire marshal could be seduced by paperwork and proof of adult behavior. He could see the sign above the front window in his mind\u2014FIXERS AND BAKERS\u2014painted without whimsy because the world would supply plenty. He could picture kids arguing about the ethics of pre-slicing electricity. He could hear Gertie bossing a borrowed oven into giving up flake. He could imagine Mrs. Banerjee setting up a folding chair like a bailiff and pronouncing on safety while her dog petitioned for and received a role as morale officer.\n\nThe landlord was a man whose cardigan had seen meetings and his eyes had seen late rents without each sighting turning him into a cynic. He walked the space with him with a kind of paternal curiosity. \u201cIt was a good print shop,\u201d he said, palm flat on the counter as if feeling the echo of receipts being signed. \u201cThen the world moved that work into computers and into rooms that did not smell like ink. What are you going to put here that will make it smell brave again.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren and sugar,\u201d he said, without thinking he was being clever. \u201cAlso, copper and old wood and a little fear managed into usefulness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city worries about you cutting fingers off the future,\u201d the landlord said, and there it was again, waiver, responsibility, the institutional vocabulary that had chased joy through gymnasiums since the advent of gymnasiums. \u201cWe can put things into papers so that everyone has their elbows in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like elbows in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will put it all into papers and we will put sticky notes on the papers to remind ourselves where we promised to be careful.\u201d He looked at the rent number, felt his stomach do the practical math that had folded him into refusal before, and felt instead, to his surprise, a steadiness. He had the small grant Flor had convinced into being with the authority of someone who treated narratives like budget line items. He had the Agricultural Society\u2019s ongoing mischief. He had a voucher in his desk for a train and he could cash that one way or another into a fundraising story and an event called Pie and Rails in which people would pay to hear Jacques by proxy. He had work that paid his rent and the kind of reputation that meant work would continue. He had a community that had trained him to ask without begging. He put his hand on the counter where paper had once been cut and leaned into the small joy of deciding.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and let the word ring in the room where no words had recently settled. \u201cOkay. We\u2019ll be careful. We\u2019ll be brave but documented. We\u2019ll do it for three months and check if the light flickers.\u201d\n\nThe cardigan man smiled and pulled a lease from a folder like a magician aware of his own clich\u00e9s. They sat on upturned crates because chairs would come later, and the pen he offered was one of those freebies from a tradeshow that wrote more stubbornly if you coaxed. He initialed so many places it became a music. He signed where names ask to be themselves. He thought of the vocabulary of commitment\u2014terms, consideration, delivery\u2014and marveled that his body did not rebel at the words. The landlord shook his hand with the grip of a man whose grandfather had shaken hands even when it snowed, and then left him alone in a space that was now, in the small ways that matter, his.\n\nHe paced the perimeter as if a careful dance could turn square footage into something friendlier. He found the light switch and tried it, as you do when you acquire something that claims it can glow. Only two of the fixtures woke, and they did so grudgingly, and he laughed out loud because of course. He fetched his screwdriver because he had brought one without permitting himself to acknowledge that he had brought one, and he popped a lens and did the first repair in a place that would teach repairs. It was small and honest, and when the light steadied it painted the dust into a hundred clear stories.\n\nOn his way home he detoured by his mother\u2019s because good news behaved like a dog in him and tugged. She opened the door with a dish towel in her hand because of course she was in the middle of something that smelled like onions and authority. He told her the rent number and the square footage and the fact that he had just agreed to a relationship with a mop. She made a face as if considering him for promotion and nodded once. \u201cI will bring a plant that refuses to die,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, I will bring young onions in a jar because children must learn that cutting something sharp can be safe if you hold it correctly.\u201d\n\nShe handed him a jar as if to make good on the promise in advance, and he hugged her because the day had asked him to carry a great deal of brave, and a hug is a form of unloading you do not have to apologize for. On his way out, she leaned out the door as she always did, the evening drafting her voice like an accomplice. \u201cNathan,\u201d she said, and it was the tone she used when she wanted his attention to be a cathedral. \u201cTeach them to breathe first. Everything else is dessert.\u201d\n\nHe slept that night the way he slept when the day had made official some private thought. He dreamed of tables arriving in a truck that had already carried twenty piano recitals and a parade, and a sign being hand-lettered by a boy whose concentration could cut glass, and a landlord\u2019s cardigan draped over a chair after hours because sometimes people forget to take off their roles when they go home. In the morning, the city had iced its sidewalks lightly and then apologized with sun, and he let that be an omen and not a trap. He drove to a job where a woman had called because her porch light overshared its opinion of dusk, and he fixed it with compassion and a little tape and a lot of listening. He took a phone call from Flor while his hands were clean and agreed to a training session on the ethics of youth programs in public spaces because someone had to make sure his good intentions were not going to trip over liability in front of witnesses. He left a message for Moira with the address of the new place and the promise of a chair with her name on it if she ever came west. He texted \u00c9lodie a picture of the empty room with the caption: room for a thunderstorm hair guest residency, and she sent back ten lightning bolts and a heart.\n\nBy afternoon he was pulling up old vinyl in the shop and discovering beneath it a floor that had made arguments with generations of shoes and would, with persuasion, tell a better story. Raj arrived with a pry bar and enthusiasm and a speech about how he had once installed a gallery show in a room that detested art and had been converted by snacks. They worked until the light called them silly and they kept going anyway, and they talked in the way men talk when their bodies are busy\u2014bits and installments and sudden sincerity like pepper thrown over the shoulder. He told Raj about the moment the shy girl\u2019s hands had believed themselves, and Raj told him about a boy who had brought a sketchbook full of houses into his office and asked where the doors belonged if you wanted people to enjoy leaving and coming back.\n\nWhen the night finished them rather than the other way around, they sat on the counter in the half-lit room and drank water from mismatched mugs a neighbor had dropped off because the city does that when it senses an opening. In the dark of the window, their faces floated like benevolent signage. \u201cYou know what you did,\u201d Raj said, not really asking.\n\n\u201cSigned a lease on a counter I had no legal right to like that much,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou put a dome car in a building,\u201d Raj said. \u201cYou are going to make a place people can sit in and look up and feel small and safe and in motion, all at once.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to protest because the metaphor was too neat and therefore asking for gravity to argue with it. He let it stand because it was also not wrong. He could already hear inside the room the counting of chews at a table, the measured rhythm of twist, the peppermint breath, the laughter when someone admitted the word waiver made their skin itch, the quiet after solutions when people looked at each other with their full faces and not their corners. He could see ladders with hands on them that did not flinch. He could imagine Mrs. Banerjee\u2019s dog in a sweater that read FACILITIES, and he laughed at that, out loud and at length, because joy stored properly does not spoil.\n\nBefore he left he took a picture of the room as it was\u2014dust and half-light and the corners where plans collect\u2014and he sent it to his mother and to Gertie and to the Agricultural man and to Moira and \u00c9lodie and Ty and to Jacques at the email address Drew had extracted from the ether with polite persistence. He wrote no caption for most and only to Jacques did he add words\u2014room with motion but no wheels yet\u2014and within an hour a reply came in English with vowels round as trains. \u201cEvery good car starts with a bench,\u201d Jacques wrote. \u201cPut benches, then you will have passengers. Someone will bleed on a ticket. Keep napkins.\u201d\n\nHe went home humming a song he would have been embarrassed to sing, the city obligingly emptying a lane for his van as if it respected the end of a day. In bed, he lay and listened to the building\u2019s pipes tell their stories and thought of the word okay said to empty rooms, train platforms, long tables, and people. He thought of the voucher in the drawer and the north, waiting with foxes. He thought of a Saturday when children would breathe like mechanics and adults would learn where to put their hands when someone else was on the ladder. He let the day pledge itself to tomorrow without being made into a boast. The radiator ticked like a cricket with good manners, and he let sleep come in polite and stay as long as it wanted.",
