     "novel_text": "In the mornings the Sa\u00f4ne moved like a long sigh between stone and sky, and the fog made the city seem disposed to forgetfulness, its towers and red roofs dissolving into a gray breath that lifted and fell. \u00c9lise liked to walk from her apartment in Vaise toward the coll\u00e8ge long before the children came pouring in, and she liked especially the cracked stretch of pavement beside the butcher that smelled faintly of fennel and rust. The air at that hour was damp enough to gather into her hair, a halo of soft frizz that her mothers would once have tut-tutted about. Her mother was dead now, but \u00c9lise still heard her sometimes\u2014This is not how a teacher presents herself\u2014like an old radio left playing somewhere behind there in childhood.\n\nShe tugged her scarf tighter and remembered that she had promised Camille she would look over the new poem, even though the girl would not need it; there was something in Camille that had begun to do its own work, a steady learning like a quiet motor. They were like that at thirteen, sometimes, full of buds that would not open for two or three years and then suddenly, one spring morning, a person. In the staff room, Renaud had already burned the coffee and was pretending, with a kind of brittle enthusiasm, that it had been on purpose to keep them awake.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too early,\u201d he said when she came in. \u201cIt\u2019s unhealthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can split the unhealthiness then,\u201d she said, hanging her coat on the back of a chair and pulling from her bag a plastic container of tiny tangerines, pocked and sweet. \u201cI brought clementines.\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought the smell of burnt.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, a feast,\u201d she said.\n\nThere were chalk dust crumbs on the table and somebody\u2019s forgotten glove. The radiator clicked. It was the first Tuesday after the vacation and everyone had that look, a faint pallor that in six weeks would become fury. Renaud passed her a cup and she took a breath and drank. It was as awful as promised, but it made her heart flicker.\n\nShe taught them Pr\u00e9vert, that morning, and she had them read the lines out loud with their neat mouths because poetry should move through the body, because she had learned to love rhythm before she learned to love meaning. That was not a thing one could tell children without sounding like you were selling them a scented candle. She told them anyway. \u201cSay it like you are not afraid of your own voice,\u201d she said, and Camille raised her head and read, and the boy in the front row whose name always escaped her snapped his gum and tried to hide it in his sleeve, and outside, a truck scratched its way along the street and then was gone.\n\nIt was after lunch, after she had eaten a hard-boiled egg and a heel of bread at her desk, that the message arrived. It came by way of her phone lying among the corrected papers like a lost fish. It came like this: a number she did not recognize, then a voice, caught a moment by the school\u2019s poor reception, and then a name. \u201cMadame Martin? It\u2019s Giraud. From Les \u00c9toiles de la Cit\u00e9.\u201d She had to say pardon twice, and carried the phone into the hall where the tiles helped the signal find its courage.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d she said, and her voice felt too thin.\n\n\u201cYou entered the regionals last month with\u2014\u201d the woman paused, a rustle of paper, \u201c\u2014with a partner, Monsieur Costa? Rafa\u00ebl Costa? I wanted to inform you that due to a disqualification, you are now qualified for the final round. It will be in Paris, the twelfth, at the Carr\u00e9. We\u2019d be delighted to have you. We sent an email yesterday but perhaps it went astray.\u201d\n\nIt had gone astray. All her emails went astray because she did not care for them. She considered them like flies at a picnic, a necessary toleration. She made a sound. It was not quite language.\n\n\u201cMadame Martin?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said again. She had to sit down on the bench under the grim class photos where dozens of children had tried to make their faces into acceptable offerings to the future. \u201cYes. That is\u2014merci.\u201d She could hear her breath. She thought of Rafa\u00ebl\u2019s shoulders and the way his jaw clenched when he laughed. She thought of the tiny trophy they had not won the last time, how she had brushed the dust from its base with a fingertip while they waited for their number to be called. \u201cIt will be\u2014next week?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe twelfth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the train\u2014\" She stopped herself. \u201cNo. Thank you. Yes. We will be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease confirm by email,\u201d said Madame Giraud. \u201cThere\u2019s a small fee to secure the slot, but nothing significant, and you can pay upon arrival. We are, truly, quite delighted. You were radiant. Your bol\u00e9ro\u2014\u201d A tut of pleasure down the line. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive my frankness, it made me cry.\u201d\n\nThe line went dead and \u00c9lise sat there with the phone in both hands and stared at her reflection in it. She looked gray; she always looked gray in the school, as if the walls rubbed their chalk onto her. The twelfth. In Paris. She breathed the words into the hollow of her scarf. A laugh rose in her throat and she smothered it. She could not bear for laughter to escape into a place like this, where it would be eaten by days.\n\n\u201cEverything all right?\u201d said Renaud, who had come to the door with a stack of worksheets and that look of a man carrying a birthday cake that he himself did not want.\n\n\u201cEverything is very well,\u201d she said. \u201cBetter than well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that allowed?\u201d\n\nShe rose, and touched his sleeve impulsively. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later. Imagine, we are quartz. We are shining.\u201d\n\nHe looked at his worksheets as if they might hold an answer. \u201cYou are peculiar, Martin. But it\u2019s good to see you be\u2014what is that word? \u00c9clair\u00e9e.\u201d\n\nShe spent the rest of the afternoon like a woman who had put down something heavy and was trying not to remember it. In 5B, when a boy called Yannis made a joke about Moli\u00e8re that turned his mouth into a little blade, she laughed and took the joke and twisted it into a lesson about farce, and the boy flushed in triumph. On the stairs a parent stopped her to ask about extra practice for exams, and she said yes to everything, and she understood nothing of what she was promising but felt she would pay it all later out of a deep reservoir of grace. The children went home into a rain that had begun precisely at four; the courtyard filled with umbrellas and yelling, and then reduced itself to a few late walkers and the sound of a ball failing to be caught.\n\nShe sent a message to Rafa\u00ebl. It said only: Can we talk? 7 at the studio? It added, in the end, because she could not help herself: Paris.\n\nHis reply came with unreasonable slowness. He worked long hours wherever it was he worked, down in some belly of a building where wires were snakes and insulation was snow. He often had blisters. He often had a look that made her want to press her fingertips to his wrists. It arrived just as she reached her apartment: Affirmative, star. 7. And a small blue star. He had a way with emojis that made them seem like pebbles he had picked up from a beach.\n\nIn her apartment the heat was a stubborn old dog that only came when it was called five, six times. She turned it on and waited. The wall by the door had a stain that looked like Corsica. She kicked off her shoes and put on the kettle and stood in the small kitchen where a single glass was drying on a towel and a bowl of lemons stubbornly refused to sweeten the air. She was not poor, not exactly, and yet she held her breath when she checked the bank app on her phone, the way a swimmer holds a breath before looking through green water for the bottom.\n\nThe numbers were what the numbers always were, a little obtuse. Enough to live. Not enough to play, not without counting. She had been telling herself this for so long it had become a lullaby. She closed the app. She drank her tea standing up. She looked at herself in the mirror that hung above the sink and saw that she was thirty-six, that is, almost forty, that is, not young and not the end of anything, that is, a person who might yet do a thing she cared about. She stuck her tongue out at herself and then laughed and went to find her dance bag.\n\nShe paused at the postcard pinned above her desk, the one of the Palais Garnier at night, and touched the edge of it with her nail. This was what she wanted: to slide into a dress that smelled of oranges and metal and to walk out onto a stage and discover that the floor had the same kind of spring as a kiss. She had started too late, as everyone told you you were not supposed to do, and she knew with an almost sweet clarity that she would never be a professional, never earn anything from this, and that because of that she had to return to it again and again, like a cat to a door it did not believe was closed.\n\nShe put on her coat and went back out, down the stair with its greased wooden banister, across to the street where the night had spread itself like ink. The studio was three tram stops away, down past the bakery that made a baguette with olives that tasted like holidays. Inside the studio the air was warm and sharp with human ambition. There were three couples in a corner working out the mechanics of a turn and a boy with earbuds doing acrobatics in the mirror. The long wall of glass reflected everyone twice, three times, into different versions of themselves.\n\n\u201cStar,\u201d said Rafa\u00ebl, from the bleachers. He wore an old sweater with holes and a grin that lived mostly in his mouth. He did not stand up, but opened his arms and she went into them, because that was their arrangement, an arrangement that had its rules. They were more than friends and less than lovers and exactly partners. They held on longer than was necessary and then let go.\n\n\u201cSay it,\u201d he said. \u201cSay it out loud, so we know if it\u2019s real.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the final round,\u201d she said. \u201cParis. The twelfth. The Carr\u00e9.\u201d\n\nHe let out a shout that made heads turn. Then he kissed the air near her cheek and did a sort of foolish dance that looked like a dance of a man mocked by happiness and grateful for it. \u201cI told you,\u201d he said. \u201cI told you they weren\u2019t blind.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me we were good enough to frighten small dogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I was translating. There is only so much my French can do.\u201d\n\nHis French was fine; he had been here since he was nine. She loved to mock him for his agreeable vowels, the way a Portuguese made everything sound a little tender. He grabbed her bag and carried it as if it weighed nothing. \u201cThe twelfth,\u201d he said, and the word seemed to take up space in his mouth. \u201cWe will kill them.\u201d\n\nShe held his arm. The word kill made her think of knives and judges and the way her heart had stopped in the regionals just before their music began. \u201cWe will not die,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will dance.\u201d\n\nFor an hour they worked, not because it mattered anymore, but because it always mattered. They whooped, they bickered, they counted: five, six, seven, eight. Her feet were fine; it was her head that failed. Sometimes she stood there, looking, and could not move forward into the next thing. He knew that place in her. He stood off the line of her body until she could feel him like a town behind her shoulder, and then she moved. They spoke little. The music did the part that words always do wrong.\n\nWhen they paused, he looked at her. \u201cDo you have\u2014\u201d he had an expression he wore when he was about to say something she would not like, \u201c\u2014you have the train covered?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, quickly.\n\n\u201cBecause I can advance you,\u201d he said, looking away at the mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. They are paying me early for the job near Oullins. The one with the leak.\u201d\n\nShe wiped sweat from her forehead with the collar of her shirt. She had a blue bruise inside her right thigh where their knees had kissed too hard in a dip. She thought of her bank app like a small, square window that opened onto a cliff. \u201cI am not an orphan,\u201d she said. She smiled. The joke was a bit poor. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. He did not believe her. He would bring it up again, because he loved her in the way one loves a dance partner or a lost cousin; he would pretend not to, because he loved her in the second way too, perhaps, and the pretending was tenderer than anything more violent. \u201cWe have to find a dress.\u201d\n\nShe had one, of course, but it had lost some of its power with the season. It had been red once, and now it was that color of a tomato that has had its finest days. She pictured herself in the bright square of the Paris stage, a smudge. She swallowed. \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always manage,\u201d he said, and he meant it as praise, but she heard the other thing in it, the piety of surviving.\n\nThey changed the music and went again. He put his hand at the small of her back and they slipped like two pieces of a machine into the turn that had broken them in the regional. This time the floor would not accept her heel; it slid, and she stumbled and caught herself on his shoulder with a little sound that was not exactly pain and not exactly fear. He laughed once, under his breath. \u201cAgain,\u201d he said.\n\nLater, when the studio had emptied and the boy with the earbuds had gone to wherever boys with earbuds go, they sat on the bleachers and drank from a bottle of water and let their bodies think things over. The window was a plain square of night.\n\n\u201cDo you ever think of stopping?\u201d he asked suddenly, as if the question had been waiting for the right breath to sit on. \u201cIf we win\u2014if we lose\u2014do you ever think of just not having the need any more?\u201d\n\nShe watched the mirror\u2019s empty face. She thought of her mother standing in the doorway of the kitchen with one hand pressed into the small of her back and a beautiful hatred of illness on her mouth. \u201cSometimes I think of stopping,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I think I can\u2019t stop. And sometimes I imagine doing just one thing well and then forgetting it forever. Like being nineteen and kissing someone who will not matter and doing it so completely that you have nothing left, so you cannot ever ask for that from anyone again.\u201d\n\nHe laughed softly. \u201cIt is good we are not nineteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d\n\nOn the tram home the world looked like photographs taken through the bottom of a lake. Her hands smelled of that studio smell, a mix of pine cleaner and breath. She put her head back and closed her eyes and let the word Paris roll through her. She could see the train in her mind, the stupid mouth of it opening, the stupid red seats, the track repeating itself under them, this ordinary miracle of locomotion. She remembered the competition\u2019s lights, how they flicker before they settle, that way the blown dust at the top of an auditorium catches the light so that one imagines falling gold. She imagined applause, but it was always the hush she wanted\u2014the way sound gets thicker when a room waits.\n\nHer phone buzzed. It was Camille. The message was shy. Madame, if you have time tomorrow, will you look at the poem? I added a part. My mother says it is too much but what can you do.\n\nShe wrote back: Yes. Bring your mother\u2019s too-much part. I like too much.\n\nThen, for no good reason, she counted her wallet\u2019s contents on her knees\u2014this childish thing, the way one counts pebbles\u2014twenty, ten, ten, a single two-euro, some coins that had no right to exist. She put them back and felt suddenly as if she were wearing a coat that had been made for someone else. She almost messaged Rafa\u00ebl. She did not.\n\nAt home she made a soup out of the carrots and a sad onion and ate it standing up again, with a little crude pepper so she could pretend it was fierce. She found the email from Les \u00c9toiles, sitting in the junk folder among offers to enlarge things she did not have. It was as Madame Giraud had said. There was a small fee and a form that asked for sizes and for a song and for an emergency contact. She put down no one for that last, and then she did put someone: Jules, her brother, whom she had not spoken to in three months and who had sent her a text that said simply, I can\u2019t continue to watch you do this to yourself. He was a kind man in a way that made him impossible. She put his number and hoped nothing would happen that required kindness.\n\nIt was when she reached the section about travel and accommodations that she paused too long. She did not have to book a hotel\u2014they offered a cheap one\u2014but she would need to secure her ticket to Paris. There were trains every hour, almost, and they were not expensive, not in the way that a dress was expensive or the cost of a mother\u2019s medicine was expensive. And yet she felt as if the numbers might do that thing numbers sometimes did: cease to belong to her.\n\nShe closed the computer and went to fill the bath. The apartment\u2019s pipes were old enough to remember better times. The water came a little brown at first and then it cleared, as if it had made up its mind. She undressed with a briskness she used for many things. She looked down at her stomach as she stepped in and thought, unkindly, almost automatically, of the girls at the studio with their knees like fresh breadsticks, and then she pushed the thought away and sank until the water came up to her ears, where everything sounds faithful.\n\nShe dreamed that night, as she often did after dancing, and the dream was of a hall with floors that refused every foot but hers. She was alone in the center and the chairs were filled with women with her mother\u2019s hair who watched her with faces that could have been either love or contempt. She woke before the applause, with tears that seemed to have been put there by someone else.\n\nThe next day began with a clatter\u2014the neighbor\u2019s young man dropping his bicycle on the landing and swearing in a whisper\u2014and came back to its normal rhythm, as days do. At school the photocopier refused one of her requests, then accepted another with a grudge. The teacher who taught maths wore a tie he had definitely bought to be a joke that had matured into a tragedy. After third period, the headmaster called a short meeting to say that there would be cuts to the field trips this year and that any excursions must be justified with something more than \u201cenrichment.\u201d There was a murmur that was not exactly agreement and not exactly rage; the teachers swam in it like fish in a small bowl.\n\nShe told Renaud at break. The coffee was less burnt but somehow more offensive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the final,\u201d she said, trying to say it as if it were a thing that could be spoken in a staff room. \u201cParis. We go next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014?\u201d For a moment he stood very straight, like someone a conductor has asked to make a noise. \u201cBrava.\u201d He said it the Italian way because last year he had fallen in love with an opera singer and entirely used up the word bravo. \u201cWhat does that entail?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe dance. People watch. There is a trophy with small gladiators on it. Very serious business.\u201d\n\nHe lifted his cup in a toast. \u201cBring a gladiator to the staff room.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will go very well with the burnt coffee.\u201d\n\nIn the afternoon Camille came with the poem and her flushed cheeks. She sat at the edge of the desk with a kind of hunger. \u00c9lise read the poem quickly first, then again slowly. It was not bad. It had one perfect line\u2014my father walks around the house like a jacket that has forgotten the body\u2014and a great many lines that were in love with their own handwriting. They talked about killing darlings without naming it that. They talked about leaving air in the poem for someone else to come in and sit down. Camille nodded like this had been what she\u2019d been trying to do all week and now could not wait to do properly. \u201cYou are too much,\u201d she said as she gathered her paper. \u201cBut I think I like too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother will have to live,\u201d said \u00c9lise.\n\nAfter school she caught the tram two stops too far, distracted by an old man asleep with his mouth open, by a poster that said something to her and then said it again differently. She walked back along the river, which today was green like an inexplicable cup, and through the market where men called apple names to her and women stacked tomatoes like rubies. She wanted everything. She bought two pears and an orange as if they were ideas. At home she weighed the bank app like a word on her tongue that she did not want to pronounce. She waited. There was no sudden influx of money from a benevolent aunt. There was the same ordinary handful of days between now and pay day and the same ledger of bills that had been waiting for her since she became her own person.\n\nShe made a list. It said: rent. electricity. telephone. metro. food. then, in small letters, dance. She stuck it on the fridge and then laughed because of course it had nothing to do with a list. She would go to Paris even if she had to walk. She would go to Paris even if she had to sit in the aisle and pretend she was a bag.\n\nThen she thought of asking Jules. She thought of calling and hearing his voice, the one he had learned to make like a spoon\u2014warm, offering. She thought of refusing the spoon because it would mean something she would hate. She put the phone back down without picking it up.\n\nAt the studio that evening, they worked with a quiet fervor that people who do not know dance might call obsession and people who do know dance might call habitation. She had eaten the orange beforehand and her tongue was sweet. They chose their music. Something Cuban that had a brass that rose like a hand. They argued about the last thirty seconds.\n\n\u201cIt should be risk,\u201d said Rafa\u00ebl, touching his chest where the music entered. \u201cIf it is not risk, it is not art. It is accountancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like accountancy,\u201d she said, smiling, but she did not like it; she liked risk and hated losing.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are not here to be careful.\u201d\n\nThey arranged the last thirty seconds to break them and then brought it back a little so they might live. It was not perfect. Nothing was. \u201cI will have to get a dress,\u201d she said, again, like a woman who says I will have to get a second job, like a woman who says I will have to learn to forgive.\n\n\u201cI can keep the boys at the site late,\u201d said Rafa\u00ebl. \u201cMake them work two more days if necessary. Then I will give you the money and you will be obliged to accept, because you have already accepted my hand and my lead and therefore you accept everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk like a man whose mother loved him too well,\u201d she said, and he laughed at that, a catch in the laugh that was not exactly pain.\n\nAfter, in the cool corridor, an old woman with a bun and a fuchsia backpack stopped \u00c9lise with a hand on her elbow. \u201cMademoiselle?\u201d she said, as if the word had failed and fallen back to the ground of another era. \u201cI saw you. You are\u2014please forgive me\u2014beautiful when you dance. The rest of the time you are ordinary, like the rest of us. But there\u2014\u201d she placed her hand very delicately at \u00c9lise\u2019s sternum, \u201c\u2014there you are like a bell.\u201d\n\nElise smiled. \u201cMerci.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Paris,\u201d said the woman, as if she knew everything about it. \u201cDo not let anyone stop you.\u201d\n\nAt home, a message waited from her landlord that said simply: Reminder. The rent must be paid by the tenth. It had a smiley face, which felt like a threat. She sat down on the couch that had belonged to her mother and stared at the place where a thread had withstood a thousand sit-downs. She could hear the upstairs couple arguing again, but softly, the way people argue after they have made a vow not to.\n\nShe took the envelope out from under the shelf where she kept envelopes. It contained eighty euros in cash, a number she had been carefully not counting since last month. She put it on the table and laid the coins from her wallet beside it. It was not nothing. It was not enough. She counted them anyway, piling them like stones.\n\nShe thought, with a sudden terrible sweetness, about stealing the money. Not from a person, never from a person; she could not bear taking the softness out of someone else\u2019s day. But from a system that would not notice. She thought of the school\u2019s petty cash box, which you had to sign for, and the way it had not been counted lately because Madame Aujoulat\u2019s father had been ill. She felt the thought and then she threw it from her, a small bird. It went to the window and tapped there and then went away.\n\nShe wrote a message to Jules and then did not send it. It said: This is childish. It said: You are right: I am doing this to myself. It said: If I do not do this, I do not know what I am for.\n\nShe went to bed. She dreamed again\u2014the hall now had a ceiling of glass and rain fell on it like beads on a drum\u2014she went through the turn that had always been a small cruelty and came out of it as if she had not been hurt in any of this. When she woke, she had the taste of pears in her mouth and could not say why.\n\nOn Thursday she took her class to the library and watched them be briefly quiet, which was a miracle she did not even require faith for, because the library had done its work for longer than any of them had been alive. She caught a glimpse, in the glass of a bookcase, of a woman who was not herself, or rather was herself if she had been the person she had thought she would be at twenty. It made her laugh at nothing and made her sad in that way that is not tragedy but is its little cousin.\n\nAt lunch she finally called Giraud to confirm, and the woman\u2019s voice was brisk with the delight of someone whose job was to put ribbons around people\u2019s desire. \u201cWe look forward to seeing you,\u201d she said. \u201cTruly. Bring your music on a USB stick. Bring your papers. Bring your luck.\u201d\n\nShe went then to the ticket site and found the trains. She chose a time that would place them in the capital three hours before they needed to be anywhere and ticked a box for a seat by a window as if this would change the course of her life. When she reached the place where you put your card numbers in, she felt her heart step into some older rhythm. It was like being a child again, balancing on a wall and looking down at gravel. She typed them. The site thought. The site thought longer.\n\nShe had ninety-three euros left until the tenth. The tickets would be seventy-six each if they were not purchased with hope but with reality. She did not have one seventy-six. She had one ninety-three. She cancelled. She closed the computer. She went to the sink and washed a glass that was already clean.\n\nShe would borrow from Rafa\u00ebl. It would be a joke between them that stung less because of their jokes. She would borrow and then pay him back with money earned from invigilation and two weeks of not buying pears. She could do it. The thought sat on her shoulder. It was not a good bird and not a bad bird; it was just a bird.\n\nThe day went on. She taught, she smiled at Renaud when he tried to sing a line from Pr\u00e9vert and came out with something like \u00c9dith Piaf being sad in a hallway. She went to the market and touched the lemons and did not buy them. She returned home and took the envelope out again and counted again and the numbers became tender in their inadequacy, like a man one knows will never love you, no matter how one speaks.\n\nIn the evening she went to the studio and found Rafa\u00ebl not yet there. She stretched, gently, as she was supposed to do, and then less gently, as she always ended up doing, because patience was not the same as virtue. A young couple practiced something furious, all elbows, and the radio tried to sell them a milk. She looked down at her shoes, these faithful leather things, and thought of Paris like a place in a book she had loved at thirteen and not had the money to buy.\n\nWhen Rafa\u00ebl arrived, he smelled of dust and rain and he kissed her cheek quickly, twice, three times as if he had missed and needed to correct. \u201cWe will practice the last second until our feet beg us to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cBut first\u2014\u201d\n\nHe pressed a small envelope into her hand. He had written her name on it in a schoolboy hand, the f choking the i. \u201cBefore you start to protest,\u201d he said, raising his palms, \u201cit is not charity. It is an investment. It is an investment in my own glory, because I have no chance without you, and that makes this transaction very pure. It is more pure than love. It\u2019s geometry.\u201d\n\nShe worked the flap of the envelope back and forth and then put it back in her bag unopened. \u201cIf it is geometry,\u201d she said, \u201cthen you can calculate the angle of my gratitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour gratitude is obtuse,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cIt takes up the whole circle. And it has sharp corners.\u201d\n\nShe did not protest. She would protest later. They danced until the muscles behind her knees trembled like mice. When they finished, the studio\u2019s cleaning woman was waiting, arms folded, to chase them out. In the street, the damp had a hunger. He walked her to the tram stop and then, impulsively, as the tram arrived, pressed his palm once to her cheek. \u201cWe will do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be a story they tell to their children who will not care.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIt will make us furious.\u201d\n\nOn the tram, she touched the place where his hand had been and thought of all the hands that had ever touched her and how they seemed now like a series of emulsions, layers, like the way garlic comes in its small papers. She took out the envelope and opened it and counted quickly: fifty, a hundred, two, two-twenty. It was too much and then not enough and then absolutely right. She felt that stew of shame and relief that sits inside acts of kindness. She sighed. She wanted to tell someone and there was no one to tell who would not make of it a diagnosis.\n\nAt home she booked the tickets. The site hummed itself into action and then spat them into her email like small birds she would have to keep warm. She stood there a long time, watching the spinner, and then felt a happiness so ridiculous, so unshaped, that she had to say something aloud to give it walls. \u201cParis,\u201d she said, to the empty room. \u201cParis, Paris.\u201d\n\nThat night she could not sleep. She lay there and watched the ceiling insist upon itself, that very particular French ceiling with its thin cracks like maps of lost territories. She tried to orchestrate her thoughts: train time, warm up schedule, food, water, sleep, the dress, a contingency plan for the moment her mind might refuse her, as it did sometimes because it was old habit to refuse itself what it wanted most. She imagined writing to Jules and saying I am in the final can you believe and the message coming back with his big-hands words. She turned over and smelled the winter coming in through the window.\n\nIn the morning, a sound like the end of distant construction woke her. She went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, thought about breakfast, decided to be a person who ate yogurt. She wrote an email to Camille about the poem and included an attachment of something by Szymborska that she loved like a secret. She put on the newish sweater she had bought in a moment of optimism in September, and a necklace she did not wear often, because she wanted the day to be heavy around her neck in a good way.\n\nIn the stairwell, the neighbor\u2019s boy was sitting on the step with his bike upside down, working the chain with black fingers. \u201c\u00c7a va?\u201d she said, because that is what you say.\n\n\u201c\u00c7a tient,\u201d he said without looking up, which is the truth of many things.\n\nOn the way to school she passed the big poster of the dance finals that someone had pasted to the wall near the tram. She wasn\u2019t on the poster, of course; it had a woman with a mouth like a promise and a man with arms that looked like good architecture. She stopped and looked, and then she looked away and then she looked back again, like a child not allowed to stare at something delicious. She wrote to Rafa\u00ebl: We must be ridiculous; they will throw flowers and we will break our ankles trying to pick them up. He wrote back a picture of a gladiator.\n\nAt school she was called into the headmaster\u2019s office. He was a neat man who wore his small authority like a jacket he was afraid of dirtying. \u201cMadame Martin,\u201d he said, \u201cI have a favor to ask. The exams require two invigilators this Saturday. We have no one.\u201d\n\nShe thought of the studio, of practicing with the panic of a person who had decided to believe in something. She thought too of the envelope with its bilingual coins. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat time?\u201d\n\n\u201cNine until noon,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew I could rely on you. You are dependable.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t know whether to be pleased or insulted. Dependable is not a word that gets invited to the finals of anything. She said yes again to the universe in general, and then went back to class and drew a diagram of a sentence on the board and made jokes about the way adjectives are like people who arrive late to parties and discover that everything they have to say has already been said.\n\nIn the quiet between classes, the world felt far away. She thought again of the year her mother had been ill and how thick the air had been in that apartment, sweet with syrups and despair, and how the bodies of the nurses had moved through it like ships. She thought of how she had begun then to go to the free salsa in the park, to learn not the dance exactly but the permission to stand in a place and take up space. It was a permission she had never had in the house, where her mother had been the size of everything. It was not a story she ever told now, because people got very close to your face when you told them something like that, and she was not interested in that closeness.\n\nShe stood at the window and watched a boy kiss a girl on the mouth behind the rubbish bins, and she smiled, and then she thought of the little turtle she and Jules had had when they were children, the way it had put its head out of the shell like a question mark, the way it had disappeared one day and never been found. She wrote Jules: I miss you. She did not send it. She put her phone away like a candy she had decided to save for later and then intended to hide from herself.\n\nAs the week turned, she felt the city begin to breathe faster. It was probably only her. The deadline for the rent crept its fingers through the days. She checked her account again, and used the precise part of her mind to divide the money for bread from the money for cow\u2019s milk. She imagined the train with its light like a clean forehead, and the station air, and the way Paris always smelled a little like gasoline and a little like old stone and something else, maybe frankness.\n\nWhen Friday evening came she and Rafa\u00ebl danced as if the floor itself were a person they wanted to seduce. They did not talk much. There is a point at which talk only frightens what must come. When she left the studio she kissed his cheek too and tasted salt and then the city came over her like a shawl. The tram was late. Two girls sang softly that song that everyone was singing and made it sound less like a funeral. The night was full of little red things\u2014tail lights, the last leaves, a scarf someone had dropped.\n\nAt home, the rent notice had come under the door, printed, like a calling card. She picked it up and placed it on the table, as if giving it a chair would civilize it. She took the envelope from her bag and put it alongside the notice. She took the little cash from the jar where she sometimes kept coffee coins. She made a neat stack. She did this as if she were a person in a film who knows that paper will change a life. She calculated the train tickets in her head and felt a small lurch at the bottom of the sum. She would be short. And if she paid the landlord first, she would not get to Paris. And if she paid the train, she would have to go to the landlord and make a shape with her mouth that said, Je vous promets.\n\nShe sat very still. Water in the radiators made a sound like wood remembering fire. The lights of a car moved along the ceiling.\n\nShe thought, for a moment that stretched too long, of not going. Of stepping back from the little precipice she had brought herself to and deciding that the sensible thing, the prudent thing, the grown-up thing, would be to be prudent and grown. That she could be the teacher who never left the city, the woman who lit a candle for herself and read in bed until she was eighty. She thought it and then she put it down, and the putting down was like lifting a piano with two fingers.\n\nShe took her shoes off and set them side by side. She put the notice face down; the white rectangle of it became just paper again. She poured herself a glass of water and drank half of it and put it down and then she stood, because standing sometimes changes the nature of a decision. She picked up her phone and wrote to Rafa\u00ebl: Tomorrow after invigilation, we will practice until no. She did not finish the sentence. He replied with a fist and a star.\n\nShe went to bed smiling at nothing. The radiator clucked. In the space just before sleep, she saw the inside of the train again, and heard the voice that would announce their arrival, the way those voices pretend to be human and then give up.\n\nAnd below the dream, below the moving and the making of lists and the small arithmetic of a life, there was, as always, an image that had come to her when she was a girl: a stage, a light that found her and made her edges crisp, a sound that connected the bones of her feet to the ancient, unnecessary, astonishing drum in her chest. It was foolish. It was not. It had accompanied her through worse than poverty, through grief that had taught her the name of every hour of the night. It was the door she tapped at, at midnight, and sometimes it opened and sometimes it did not, but always, always, she could see the light under it, and that was enough to keep her there, singing a little nonsense tune until someone turned the knob.Saturday placed its heavy hand on the building early, so that the stairwell already smelled of damp wool and pencil shavings when \u00c9lise left for the coll\u00e8ge. The invigilation box sat squat on the desk in the office with its packet of extra pens and its roll of numbered labels that made every child temporarily a receipt. She signed for the key and took a breath that tasted of yesterday\u2019s photocopies, then walked to the assigned room with the deliberate pace of someone escorting themselves. The windows there had the institutional view she always loved\u2014sky, a portion of a plane tree, the top of a bus stop where someone had written a declaration of love that used up all its vowels.\n\nThey came in holding their fear the way one holds a plate of soup: two hands, high, careful. She greeted them, named the rules, repeated them, set the papers face down like towels, and then they began. Silence arrived in its particular shoes. It was not the silence of churches, nor the silence of deep winter, but that civic pause people enter when they agree, without discussing it, that they will behave as if they, together, can be trustworthy. There was the coughed apology, the scrape of a chair foot across linoleum, the steady saw of the hallway\u2019s distant cleaning machine. For a while, she forgot she wanted anything besides this\u2014a room of people trying with their whole bodies to put a thought into a small square. The hush thickened so pleasantly that she had to stop herself from smiling, in case a child mistook it for cruelty or a trap.\n\nHalfway through, the boy with the deliciously destructive jokes, Yannis, lifted his head, met her eyes with a sort of adolescent honesty, and then let his gaze slide to the left. The girl beside him stiffened in that way the body does when it knows it is about to be offered a sin. \u00c9lise raised her eyebrows and walked as if to the window, pausing so near their desk that they could smell her tea breath. She did not speak. She did not have to. The long corridor of years ahead of them would be full of rooms like this and chances to become either the person who helps or the person who pretends not to see. The boy looked down, the girl exhaled, the small moral city within the school continued to stand.\n\nWhen it was over, there was a sound like discarded armor as the children put down their pens. They filed out blinking, temporarily lighter, like people leaving a cinema. She collected the papers, shuffled them, sealed them with an official sticker that was only glue and yet, apparently, a guarantee that the world would keep its promises. In the staff room, Renaud applauded lazily with his fingers against his own palm and offered her the last brioche from a bag that had failed to keep it tender. They ate in solidarity with themselves. \u201cYou will go this afternoon and make the floor ask for mercy,\u201d he said, and she liked him for understanding that this was a thing one could want.\n\nShe changed at the studio only partially, keeping her school skirt and exchanging her blouse for a tank, and for a moment the half-costume felt like the perfect outfit for her life\u2014one foot in one world and the other insisting on rhythm. Rafa\u00ebl arrived late, hair wet with the rain he had refused to avoid, and his apology was a grin with its hat in its hand. They worked without talking about it, in the way people do who have spent a very long time learning the grammar of each other\u2019s hips. The last thirty seconds, which had been a negotiation with risk, turned into an argument with gravity. Three times they took the turn that held in it the possibility of farce or flight, and three times she felt her heel kiss the floor exactly once like a polite guest. He did not let go of her hand even when they were safe. \u201cYou see,\u201d he said, later, warm breath on her temple, \u201cyou see, star, the body learns even when the mind is trying to pay the rent.\u201d\n\nWhen they stopped, the clocks everywhere seemed to discover that they had been neglected and began to announce themselves. She sat on the bleachers and found that her skirt had acquired a chalk smear that looked like the ghost of a palm. The envelope in her bag felt like a second heart. If she closed her eyes, she could see the sectioned red of the train seats and the smear of countryside that would serve as a thinking place. \u201cWe need a dress,\u201d Rafa\u00ebl said, as if the sentence might conjure one.\n\n\u201cI have been imagining the dress like a country,\u201d she said. \u201cI plan to move there and become a minor official.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be the minister of making people gasp,\u201d he said, making a little courtly bow with his stupid holey sweater, and she wanted to kiss the crown of his head the way one kisses a child before sending him somewhere dangerous.\n\nOn Sunday, the city put on its underclothes and went out anyway. The market along the quai was flapped into shape by wind; the women who sold cheese held knives whose reflections looked like birds. She had made a plan that seemed to her like a good lie\u2014she would find something secondhand that felt like a secret agreeing to be visible. The first shop smelled of starch and old quarrels. A bell announced her and a woman without eyebrows gave her a glance that felt like a sting test. There were dresses in every register of the past: taffeta sighs, beaded sentences, the optimisms of decades she had not been alive for. She touched them the way one touches a dream, with the tips of her fingers. None of them were right, not because they were ugly\u2014they were all beautiful, even the ridiculous ones\u2014but because they were stories that would not be hers to tell.\n\nIn a smaller shop on the side street where the pavement buckled over the roots of an arrogant plane tree, she found a dress that had once been worn by a woman who believed in telephones that connected quickly. It was a dark green that sometimes thought it was black, cut on the bias with the particular intelligence of someone who liked knees. Sequins were absent, which made her feel more honest. The price, penciled on a tag with a cheerful lie, was less awful than she had feared, but not nothing. \u201cTry,\u201d said the woman behind the counter, who was not the kind of woman with eyebrows but was the kind with wrists that had done work.\n\nIn the curtained space where all the mirrors disagreed with each other a little, she put it on. It slid over her like a kind argument. The strap on the left side had seen things and needed a sure needle. The hem would have to learn where her ankle was. But the dress did to her shoulders what she pretended not to know she wanted dresses to do. She stepped out and the woman put her head to one side, appraising with the practice of a person who has watched many strangers come out of many curtains. \u201cIf you were two centimeters taller,\u201d she said, \u201cI would call it destiny. As it is, we will call it work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can pay a deposit,\u201d \u00c9lise said, and the sentence made a clean wound in the air. The woman nodded, as if the air had been bleeding all day, and named a number with the mercy in it already. \u00c9lise counted out bills and felt both humiliated and saved. They made arrangements like people make arrangements about children at the end of parties\u2014when to return, where to meet, what to do if the weather changed its mind. She stepped back into her own clothes and felt as if she had removed not a dress but a version of herself that had reluctantly agreed to exist.\n\nBack at the apartment, the rent notice lay where she had left it, patient, sure of itself in the way only paper seems allowed to be. The tenth would be Monday. She sat down to compose a message to the landlord that would sound the way she needed it to sound: apologetic but dignified, temporary in its request, explicit in its promise. She stared at the empty message and thought of Jules\u2019s spoon-voice. She thought of the envelope in her bag and the cash she had kissed into train tickets and deposit. She called instead of writing, because she had learned that sometimes the sound of a human throat can do what text cannot.\n\n\u201cMadame Hanriot,\u201d she said when the woman answered, and then apologised for calling on a Sunday because she was French and had been raised to respect leisure as if it were a religion. \u201cIt\u2019s Martin. In 3C. I wanted to ask if I might pay on the twelfth. There has been a delay. I can bring it to you, first thing, before I go to work.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, full and businesslike. She could hear, behind the woman, a television that had not decided whether to be tragic or entertaining. \u201cThe twelfth is after the tenth,\u201d said Madame Hanriot, as if mathematics might persuade her that kindness had no place here.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said \u00c9lise, and let her voice show its naked hands. \u201cIt will not be a habit. It will be this once. If it were not\u2014\u201d and here she almost said if it were not the dance but bit the words back because it would only make her sound childish and, besides, not everyone believed in the ways one saved oneself\u2014\u201cif it were not this week, I would not ask.\u201d\n\nAnother pause, then the sound of a woman taking off a pair of glasses and putting them back on. \u201cThe twelfth,\u201d the landlord said at last. \u201cBut you will bring it. You will not slide it under my door at midnight. And you will not make me call you again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will bring it,\u201d said \u00c9lise, who could have gone on saying it like a mantra, because sometimes saying yes is the only proof one can offer.\n\nShe hung up and stood completely still just long enough to feel the tears come and go without lodging. The relief made a kind of space in her that she immediately filled with dread of what she had promised. She opened the window a little and the city sent in a smell of wet leaves and motor oil that did more for her than any perfume.\n\nOn Monday the school returned to its riverbed. Children poured and pooled; grown-ups built small banks with their bodies. Camille came to her at break, poem in hand and a giddiness on her face like a secret she was willing to share. \u201cI took the line about the jacket out,\u201d she said breathlessly, \u201cbecause I thought it was maybe a different poem. But then I made something new with it at home, and maybe it is two poems, and I felt a little like a thief and a little like God.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is writing,\u201d said \u00c9lise, who wanted to say everything else as well, wanted to say I am proud of you and I would like to live in those little seconds where you discover yourself, but who knew not to pack a child\u2019s pockets with adult sentences. \u201cBring both tomorrow. We will see which is which, and they will both be themselves.\u201d\n\nRenaud, later, leaned against her classroom door with a paper cup he had for once not burned and said, \u201cI spoke to Anne this weekend,\u201d with a studied lightness that meant this was a sentence with a heavy core. Anne was the opera singer who had taught him what it was to be both astonished and exhausted by a person. \u201cShe said she would come to Paris if she could get the Sunday train. She said to tell you that a stage is a ship and if you are not a little sick you are not far enough from shore.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnne is a menace,\u201d \u00c9lise said, and they both smiled because love and menace often share a wardrobe. \u201cDoes she have\u2014\u201d she began, and then did not want to say it. \u201cDoes she have, by any chance, opinions about dresses that have holes in their straps?\u201d\n\nRenaud\u2019s look brightened with the relief of someone who has been waiting to be useful. \u201cOpinions are her raw material,\u201d he said, taking out his phone as if opinions could be ordered like bread. \u201cShe will have a sewing kit the size of a pharmacy. She will live for this.\u201d\n\nThe days made their little beads and slid along the string. When the tenth passed like a truck that did not stop at her door, she felt temporarily lightheaded and then, sensibly, went and lay down on the couch for ten minutes to let her blood think. The dress was ready for its trial. The woman at the shop had made the strap suddenly certain and had taught the hem to respect her ankle. When \u00c9lise turned in the mirror, she saw someone who could pass for the kind of person who deserves a trumpet. She held very still and let the feeling pass through without resistance, the way she had learned to let grief pass through years ago, so that it would not settle stubbornly in an organ and declare itself king.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the studio belonged to them. The boy with the earbuds had gone early to a job in a pizzeria; the furious couple had broken up in a way that involved chairs and apologies and then returned to the room pretending to have learned something. The air had that soft electrical smell that studios and power stations share. She warmed her ankles with devotion. He did the ridiculous jumps that made him feel like a boy again and made her feel that the ceiling was only a suggestion. They ran the piece in full, paused, altered the smallest gesture at the ninth second because sometimes it is the ninth second that saves you. When they stopped, a fine trembling had taken up residence in her hands. He looked at her and nodded as if to say yes, this is how we know we are alive.\n\nOutside, the city offered an evening that had been cut slightly too short and mended with neon. They walked without meaning to, past the bakery with its olive bread, past the shop where she had not bought lemons, past a man who was singing a song to himself that had no words. \u201cWhen we get there,\u201d said Rafa\u00ebl, \u201cwe will do our forgetting. We will forget the list, we will forget that there is a name for what we are doing, we will forget that other people have eyes.\u201d He looked at her and had that look he sometimes had, the one that made her think of bridges, not because he wanted to cross, but because he understood the engineering. \u201cWe will not forget each other,\u201d he added, almost as an afterthought, and the afterthought was truer than the sentence.\n\nAt home, there was a message from Jules. It had two parts. The first was a photograph of a turtle shell that had washed up on a beach he had been visiting with his children, the kind of thing the sea gives you like a joke. The second was a sentence that said, simply, I was not kind. The sentence had been written as if it had to be smuggled past guards. She held the phone and walked circles in the small apartment as if planning a parade. She wrote back, finally, I am in the final. There will be a trivial trophy. There will be music. I will be in Paris on Tuesday. She sent it without reading it again, because if she read it again she would begin to make it polite, and nothing has ever been saved by politeness.\n\nThat night, she dreamed of the studio clean and empty. The windows were open on every wall and the river had come in without bothering to use the door and was moving the benches around with the gentle entitlement of an old friend. She stepped into the water in her dress and it did not cling to her; it moved the way seaweed moves, on purpose and with a sense of humor. There were spectators on the bleachers, but their faces were not her mother\u2019s. They were people she did not know, which felt like mercy. When she woke, she could still feel the slight resistance water gives to a calf, and it gave her a confidence she did not accept with her mind but accepted with her ankles.\n\nThe train day arrived at last with the ridiculous precision of a clock whose hands had been chastened. She woke before the alarm because happiness is a good alarm. She ate half a banana and a piece of toast with nothing on it, because stomachs at such times are conservative. She packed the USB stick with the music as if it were a vial of medicine. She put the dress into a bag that made no claim to its grandeur. Her apartment felt suddenly like a stage set for a life she would pick up again on Wednesday, plates standing in little cities on the drying rack, a book on the arm of the chair open to the place where a woman was about to say something foolish. She turned off the radiators as if she were saying goodbye to a pet.\n\nAt the station, the boards with their brittle clatter presented the city with its choices. People took themselves to be delivered. Rafa\u00ebl arrived with a suitcase he had borrowed from a cousin, a square thing with stickers from places neither of them had been. He had shaved, which suited him and made her suspicious. \u201cI did not sleep,\u201d he confessed, and then immediately slept for ten minutes on the plastic seat while she watched their bags and the enormous minutes roll by.\n\nOn the platform, as the train made its long flirtation with stopping, Anne appeared like a person herself late from an aria. She wore a jacket the color of dangerous fruit and had, indeed, a sewing kit. She kissed \u00c9lise with noise and said, \u201cYou will be fine, because you have cheekbones,\u201d and kissed Rafa\u00ebl and said, \u201cYou will be fine because of your regret.\u201d She was everything Renaud had described and also nothing like him, which is how affection tells its truth. In the compartment, she took out a tin of pins and a small jar of jam, which seemed to \u00c9lise like the perfect inventory for a person. \u201cWe will fix anything that is broken,\u201d she said, and said nothing at all about rent or grit or deserving, which endeared her.\n\nThe train conducted them with authority into beginning. Fields performed their trick of changing without leaving. The sky didn\u2019t bother with a thesis. People around them did the ordinary miracles of travel: a woman rode while making a to-do list that included the word happiness underlined twice, a boy slept in a position only boys will trust, a man made eye contact with his own reflection and seemed not to enjoy what he saw. Rafa\u00ebl woke, ate a piece of bread as if bread were an invention he was proud of, and took her hand without looking at her, as if to warm a tool.\n\nParis received them with its usual unintimidated face. The station breathed them out. The taxi delivered them to a side street near the Carr\u00e9, where trucks were being asked to be graceful and men were making good work look like chaos. Backstage, the corridor had that austere smell of clean floor and concentrated dreams. Names were being stuck to doors with tape; everywhere there was the rustling paper sound of people telling themselves they were prepared. Their dressing room was a square of light and a rack. It had a mirror framed with bulbs that told the truth and got away with it.\n\nThey rehearsed their walk from the wings to the mark, because walking is something people forget to study when they are trying to do something else. The stage, unlit, was indifferent to them in a way that comforted her. On the far side, two women practiced quiet violence in heels and did not fall. A small man with a moustache arranged trust into cables. A girl of seventeen, fragile and invincible, put on lashes as if she were laying a road.\n\nAt sound check, their brass rose like a hand in the dark and touched the upper air. The room answered with its own throat. \u00c9lise felt the small trick of the floor beneath its sprung astonishment and thought, absurdly, of soup coolers in school cafeterias with their inexhaustible vats. Anne pinned the dress in two secret places and gave the strap a last bit of encouragement that was technical and also, somehow, maternal. \u201cYou can eat a fruit,\u201d Anne commanded, handing her a plum that did in fact taste like a small decision. \u201cNot more. Your stomach will betray you.\u201d\n\nIn the hour between knowing that something will happen and watching it happen, time sometimes goes to sit in the hallway and is replaced by a simpler cousin. They warmed their backs against a wall; they spoke in a pidgin of their own that did not mention the names of gods. Renaud texted a photo of the staff room with the caption the burnt has been replaced by the overboiled, which made her laugh while making her want to cry. Jules sent two words: Go well. She felt those words like two small weights in each pocket, the kind that keep a woman\u2019s dress from flying up in wind.\n\nWhen they were called, it was like stepping into a smell she had known all her life and could not name. Rafa\u00ebl pressed his mouth once to the top of her head, which their arrangement both allowed and forbade. The lights did their mad insects dance and then settled; the audience became not one large animal but a discipline. She could hear the hush in its shoes. She put her foot on the mark that someone had taped where the world expects feet to go. The music began in exactly the place she had dreamed it would begin, and they did not lose each other even once.\n\nThere is, sometimes, a moment in dancing when the future does not exist and neither does the past, when the body is not a bank account or a mistake or a promise of something better, but only an engine beloved by the matter that surrounds it. She knew she had arrived in that place the way one knows one has closed a door properly\u2014by the lack of any noise from it, by the way the wind ceases to be a question. Their last turn sharpened itself into relief. They ended not at the edge of a laugh but at the bottom of a breath, holding themselves open just long enough that the room could pour something into them that was not audible.\n\nApplause is sometimes a polite rain, sometimes a weather one has no right to. This was the second kind. She looked at him, not because they shared their glory but because they shared the ridiculousness of being people who had asked for that glory aloud. They bowed as if it were a joke they had told themselves, and walked off like waiters who had not dropped a single glass.\n\nBackstage had discovered them and began to make of them a story, the way backstages do because they cannot help themselves. A woman they had never met kissed her cheeks and immediately corrected her posture. A man in a hat told Rafa\u00ebl that his line was clean and then explained to someone standing behind them what a clean line was. Anne dabbed a place on the dress that did not need dabbing and then hugged her so completely that for three seconds she could not have said what direction was.\n\nThey did not wait for the results the way normal people wait for weather. They said a sentence to each other three times\u2014We did not die\u2014and each time it meant something different. When the list went up in its bureaucratic font, she had to stand on her toes to see over a man\u2019s shoulder. Their names were there, not at the top like the kind of story people adore, but not in the middle either, in that place where something like endurance lives. Third. The number looked compassionate and exacting, and it had the side benefit of not asking them to make speeches that would later humiliate them when they remembered what their mouths had done.\n\nThey took their trophy\u2014gladiators as promised, so small and self-serious she loved them\u2014and she felt the way she sometimes felt after kissing, which was that the world was nothing but a surface she now understood better. In the corner of the room, a girl cried for reasons that were either disappointment or the exhausting relief of not having to be hopeful for three hours. Rafa\u00ebl leaned his forehead against hers and said nothing, and the nothing made her think of that year in the house with the sickroom noises and the nurses with ships for bodies, and of the first time she had taken a step toward music without asking anyone for permission.\n\nOn the train back, Anne slept with the sewing kit on her lap like a cat. Outside, the fields used up their remaining green. Rafa\u00ebl held the trophy and made it walk along the edge of the window as if it were brave and on a ledge. They did not talk about money. They did not talk about the twelfth being not a miracle but a day, and the rent waiting like a dog behind a door. Anne woke just enough to say, \u201cWhen you are very old you will remember the feel of your foot at the end of that turn and it will be worth half a lifetime of being sensible,\u201d and fell back into sleep, trusting them to understand that sometimes a blessing arrives wearing a ridiculous hat.\n\nAt the station in Lyon, the air smelled of their own city\u2019s mixture of bread and concrete. They carried the suitcase between them as if it were a cradle. In the taxi, there was a radio program that had invited a philosopher to talk about usefulness and art, and \u00c9lise laughed so abruptly that the driver looked at her in the mirror with the concern of a man who will have to clean the back seat if things go wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said, though it was, in fact, everything. \u201cIt is only that for once I have no argument to make.\u201d\n\nAt home, the apartment greeted her with its water pipes\u2019 frankness. She set the gladiators on the table and placed beside them the rent notice for the morning, and the little pile of cash that would join the rest and make good on a promise. She undressed with the carefulness one uses with borrowed things. In the mirror, she saw a woman whose hair had decided to be ridiculous and a line at the corner of her mouth she had not noticed yesterday. She put her palm to her sternum where the old woman in the fuchsia backpack had touched her and felt that bell still vibrating. It was a low sound, and it made the glasses on the shelf think about moving, and it was hers.Chapter 5\n\nMorning did not so much arrive as assemble itself out of serviceable parts, and she woke to find the light already doing its mild duty across the floorboards. The gladiators on the table had fallen in the night with a clink so modest that it had crossed into her dream and politely leaned against the wall there, and she righted them with two fingers and told them not to get ideas. The rent notice lay beside them like a cousin who enjoyed being correct. She washed her face at the sink where the mirror always made her a little more gray and a little more industrious, and she tied her hair back with the elastic she had found last week beneath a tram seat, because sometimes luck is simply deciding to pick something up that other people do not want. When she counted the envelope a final time, the bills seemed lighter for having already been promised, like children ready for a school trip who are determined not to cause trouble.\n\nIn the stairwell, the damp smelled like a noncommittal apology, and the neighbor\u2019s boy had left the bicycle in a position that suggested optimism about gravity. On the second floor landing, Madame Hanriot\u2019s door was open a crack, which in that building meant either catastrophe or company, and when she knocked lightly she heard the television\u2019s underfed chatter and the urgent concentration of a cat demanding to be let out of a closed room. The landlord appeared with her glasses on a chain and that expression of someone who has never been late for anything except, perhaps, joy, and \u00c9lise held out the envelope with both hands as if it were a ceremony they had prepared for together. They did the little arithmetic aloud, for the god of exactness, and then Madame Hanriot surprised her by glancing past her shoulder into the corridor and saying, almost confidingly, that when she had been nineteen she had once driven to Marseille on a whim to see a man dance on a table, and that it had been a great waste of petrol and a very important expenditure all the same.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t dance,\u201d the older woman said then, with the investigating curiosity of someone who has seen shoes and shoulders but prefers to be told.\n\n\u201cI dance enough to have to ask you for the twelfth,\u201d said \u00c9lise, and the smile they shared was the kind women share when they have both kept an account no one else has access to. At the end of the exchange, Madame Hanriot put three euros into \u00c9lise\u2019s palm with the crispness of a notary and said they were from the meter downstairs which had begun to work properly again, and the absurdity of the tiny refund made them both laugh a little longer than the amount deserved, because laughter at such a scale is an excuse to like each other without committing to anything.\n\nThe walk to the coll\u00e8ge tasted of tin and bakery, and at the corner by the butcher the fennel smell was practicing for better weather. The school\u2019s front door, painted a municipal green that resisted sophistication, had been propped with a chair, which meant something had broken and custodians were dealing with it by allowing air to pretend to be a hinge. In the staff room, the coffee wore an expression of resigned virtue; Renaud had been beaten to the machine by someone unimaginative, and was stirring a small tub of yogurt with the philosophical attention people give to white substances in early hours. When she lifted the trophy out of her bag, letting the gladiators inspect the crumbs of chalk and the folded newspaper that enumerated tragedies briskly, he made a sound that was nearly a curse and then kissed the top of one small bronze head with a flourish that was entirely unserious and entirely sincere.\n\n\u201cYou brought Rome to us,\u201d he said, and set the figurine on the shelf that held, among other things, three ceramic owls and a plant that had decided to convert dust into a lifestyle. \u201cWe are an empire again. Now the coffee may burn with dignity.\u201d\n\nShe told it all quickly, the way one tells news that has already turned into memory, because otherwise it begins to tell you. She told the hush and the brass and the way the end had felt like holding a breath she could finally release into a room that understood her. Renaud, who would have mocked any word that admitted to being noble, kept his face serious for the duration and then, perhaps realizing he had managed to be grave for too long, announced that an electrician had been reluctant to fix the photocopier because he claimed it had ambitions, and that therefore today\u2019s copies might come out like poetic fragments, which would suit her perfectly. She laughed, and beneath the laughter she felt the small animal of fatigue curl itself against her ribs in a way that felt affectionate rather than predatory, as if her body had decided to protect her by asking only for a chair.\n\nCamille arrived at break with hair that had decided to be bigger than her face, breathless not from running but from being awake in a world that had finally given her two poems. She handed over the pages with a solemnity that warned against jokes and then hovered, pretending to read a poster about a debate club. The first poem had been cut cleanly where it had needed it, not like a martyr but like an adult, and the line about the jacket had, as promised, been given a room of its own, where it had invited a lamp and a silent rug. They talked in the back of the classroom where the light made people honest, about what happens when a metaphor gets tired, about what generosity between lines might look like, and about the kind of bravery it takes to discard something perfectly written because it has hidden the thing you were trying to say. Camille\u2019s mother had written at the top in a pinched hand that she did not understand the thing about the father and the jacket, and they agreed that often the people being written about must be allowed to be wrong.\n\nThe day put on its clothes and stood in front of her the way days always do in schools, stubbornly practical in their shoelaces and their whistles. During the third hour, the headmaster arrived at her door with the dignified flurry of a minor official whose world has developed a leak, and asked, in that way he had of prefacing decisions with the word \u201cunfortunately,\u201d whether she might, what with her success in things pertaining to rhythm, consider organizing a weekly club for students who bore a dangerous quantity of fidgets. There would be no money, of course, except in the budget where money is kept for things seen to be desirable by committees, and perhaps if she wrote a grant application, which was the secular prayer these days, something might be arranged. She kept her mouth from saying something that would taste good and then upset her stomach, and said instead that she would think and draft and find a way to make a floor remember feet. He smiled with relief and moved on like a trolley.\n\nAfter classes, the school emptied itself in a performance that had been rehearsed for decades, and the courtyard let go its racket and then became a place where a solitary ball sought a friend and a woman with a clipboard pretended to be more official than she felt. She took the trophy to show the library, because the librarian loved objects and thought books were better when they had to share the air with things that had weight. He placed it between a dictionary that knew too much and a glass jar of marbles that he used to explain randomness to children who understood it intuitively, and he asked her to write a small label. The word gladiator, handwritten, struck her as both faintly ridiculous and correct, which is probably what the truth looks like when it wears a costume.\n\nShe went home the long way, because she could, because the rent had been paid and the world had not punished her for being absurd. The river was in a green mood and the sky had decided to practice being larger than it needed to be, and on the embankment an old man fed a piece of bread to a dog so tenderly that the bread seemed to become a new organ. The fuchsia backpack appeared to her peripherally before its owner did, as some objects announce their people, and the old woman from the studio called out to her as if greeting a niece she had briefly misplaced. They stood together watching damp swans be overpraised by tourists, and the woman told her that she had once learned every step of a Cha-Cha in a single night because she was trying to forget a man whose name began with M and who had owned a bakery and a darkness. It had worked for three months, which is a result most religions would envy.\n\nAt the apartment, the silence was a kind one, and she set down her bag, unpinned her hair, and did the small domestic trick of making a sandwich feel like an accomplishment. The trophy looked patient and foolish on the table, and when she brushed it with her thumb the dust there gave up its place generously. There was an email from Madame Giraud, whose consonants always felt like a firm hand, congratulating them again and attaching a small, polite request for a two-sentence quote to be used in a local write-up, and she wrote something that she hoped would make her future self less likely to wince. She thanked the stage, which is a sentimental thing to do, and she thanked the people who had invented the screws that made it possible for boards to pretend to be silence.\n\nRafa\u00ebl sent a message that was a photograph of his wrist with a blister the size of a coin and the caption my kingdom for a glove, and she sent back instructions about warm water and ridiculously expensive creams and he replied with a picture of a tin of old-fashioned salve that he claimed could cure both leaks and heartbreak. They met at the studio anyway, because you do not stop touching the door just because it opened once, and there they practiced not the piece but the habit. He did the thing where he put his hand at the small of her back without demand, the way one makes a promise to a wall when one is drunk, and she felt that sore triumphant place in her body where triumph has left a bruise and decided to name it. They tried a step they had abandoned months ago because it had made her feel as if she were a coin being tossed into an uncertain hat, and this time it felt like a leaf returning to a tree; they kept it and were possibly ridiculous for doing so.\n\nThey argued with pleasure about what would come next, as people argue when the thing just done has protected them from the future for a day or two. He wanted to sign them up for a spring festival on a square where the stones had seen men behead fish and women argue the price of apricots, while she wanted to spend a month doing nothing except finding a way to teach Camille to stand with her shoulders where shoulders are supposed to be. He called her a saint with bad knees and she called him an apostle with bandaged wrists, and the boy with earbuds looked up from his acrobatics long enough to grin and then go back to letting gravity teach him and ignoring it anyway.\n\nIn the late evening, when the city begins to withdraw its offers and ask instead for stories, she stood at her window and watched two men carry a sofa across the street without the help of kindness, and she thought how some objects pass through lives like ministers and others like friends. Jules\u2019 message arrived with a pause built into it, as if it had sat by itself on a bench for a while before deciding whether to cross a street. He said he would be in Lyon on Friday with the children, that he had promised them a museum and the funicular, and that if she had time they would like to see her face in the large. He did not mention the word sorry again, which pleased her because repetition makes apology cheap, and he did not threaten to bring a lecture, which pleased her because she was not a child and had no desire to audition for that role. She wrote back that she would meet them near the fountain where pigeons practiced being citizens, and she imagined his daughters counting lions and being unmoved by history.\n\nSleep found her like an afterthought, and she welcomed it like a lover who has learned to knock. In the morning, her ankle did the small complaint that meant she had treated it like a democracy and it had preferred a benevolent dictatorship, and she promised it sympathy in the form of warm water and attention. The day\u2019s lessons involved the subjunctive, which made everyone briefly wish for death and then become dignified, and in the second class a boy asked why one needed to talk about what might not be true, and she answered that without it no one could write a love letter or threaten revenge or imagine their lives into a shape they could bear, and he looked at her with that face children sometimes have when they ask a question for one reason and receive an answer that grows a new room in their house.\n\nIn the afternoon, she went to the headmaster with her draft of a club that did not want to be called a club because that word had sat too long under posters with clip-art. She proposed, instead, a laboratory of movement where feet and sentences could conspire, and he, perhaps unexpectedly, set down his pen and admitted that as a child he had once wished to be a tightrope walker until his father, a man of lists, had convinced him that the world required more men who could sign documents. They worked out a schedule between them like a truce, and she left with the sense of having smuggled a small contraband across a border that had been left, for a moment, unguarded.\n\nOn Thursday evening, the apartment of her childhood sent its ghost in the form of a smell that did not belong to her building\u2014boiled chicken and a kind of institutional orange\u2014and she stood very still until it passed, because memory is a bully until you refuse to give it attention. She took the bus to the shop with the dress to bring the woman a small plant wrapped in paper because gratitude is better worn than spoken, and found the counter attended by a young man with shoulders who called for his mother with the composed irritation of a person who has watched thread his whole life. The woman emerged with a pin in her mouth and kissed both of \u00c9lise\u2019s cheeks without removing the pin, then nodded at the dress where it hung with an expression she seemed to believe reflected well upon herself. They joked about the strap\u2019s behavior onstage, as if it had been a teenager, and in parting the woman said that the dresses that did the least work often did the most good, which \u00c9lise tried to hear as philosophy and not as evidence against her own desire for instruments that glitter.\n\nFriday took on the shape of a plan. Jules texted that they were on the 10:12 and that the children had eaten something sweet that had converted their bones to air, and she prepared herself to receive her nieces with a face that would make them believe in aunts. At the square, the pigeons did their municipal business and the fountain performed its stately nonsense, and the two girls approached with the motion of people who have taught their shoes to love running more than they love feet. The older was lanky and suspicious and the younger was a small justice of the peace; both attached themselves to her waist with the generous greed of family, and Jules arrived with that smile he uses when he does not know how to be forgiven and a day-old beard that made him look like his father, which made her want to kiss and hit him in quick succession.\n\nThey did the things people do when they have not quarrelled about anything that can be fixed by doing things. They rode the funicular and pretended to be unimpressed and failed, and the girls loved a painting because it had a dog in it, and in the cramped lunch hour they ate sandwiches that hurt the gums and pretended they did not, and Jules told her a story about his youngest refusing to accept that rain existed because it had not yet rained on her birthday, and she told him a story about Anne\u2019s sewing kit containing a jam that tasted of confession. Between the jokes there were small plazas where quiet could stand, and in one of those he said he should not have written the sentence about watching her hurt herself, that he had meant he did not know how to help and that watching someone you love not be saved by what they love is the sort of puzzle that ruins men who like solutions.\n\n\u201cI am not a problem,\u201d she said, and they both smiled at the silliness of the sentence because everything is a problem if you look at it from the right angle, and then she took his hand, which was no longer the boy\u2019s hand she remembered and not yet the old man\u2019s hand she did not want to consider, and squeezed once. The girls climbed on the lion\u2019s stone back and declared war on an invisible army, which is the sort of war adults ought to have to fight daily for exercise.\n\nAt the studio that evening, she and Rafa\u00ebl gave themselves the luxury of dancing badly on purpose, which is to say they let themselves laugh at their feet and taught their shoulders that grace is sometimes a matter of timing and sometimes a matter of consenting to be ridiculous. A salsa night had been announced by a flyer with a photograph of a couple whose lips seemed unsure whether to belong to their own faces, and they considered joining the crowd that would later call names of steps to one another as if ordering drinks. In the end they stayed in their familiar square, because even f\u00eates can be a burden, and because among their own mirrors and their own benches they did not have to be received by strangers who might decide to love them for the wrong reasons.\n\nSaturday was the kind of day that hides a needle in a cushion. The morning made itself easy, and she did the useful nothing of errands until the afternoon asked for an accounting. She had promised herself she would not touch the envelope of leftover cash because promises are an architecture and she was tired of rebuilding, but then a bill arrived with the urgency of red ink and the postman\u2019s apology, and she sat with the paper in her hand long enough to give it the shape of something that could kill her if she let it land. She called the company, which presented itself as an idea and a menu, and waited through a version of a song that someone had chosen for its ability to be unnoticed. When a person finally arrived at the other end of the line, breathing had never seemed so significant. The human voice reduced the threat in the paper by half, which is what voices do, and together they negotiated a delay and a reduction and an agreement that she would call again before the calendar did. She hung up and felt exemplary, then immediately humiliated by the smallness of the achievement, and she went to the window and watched the street for a while until a man with a ladder taught her that balance is not a metaphor and then made it one by nearly falling and laughing.\n\nLate in the day, a message from Giraud arrived like a note slid across a table by someone competent. There would be, she wrote with the tidy optimism of a schedule, a small showcase at the end of the month for those who had placed, and a short interview filmed for social channels whose hunger she would not insult by underestimating. If they wished to be included, they need only say yes and bring the dress that had caused a backstage debate among the seamstresses about bias and idiocy. \u00c9lise read the email twice, then a third time with one hand on her chest where the bell had been touched and told the air that she would, yes, continue to say yes because saying no had never saved her from anything worth being saved from. She texted Rafa\u00ebl, who replied first with caution because he had learned to distrust the moment after victory, and then with a photograph of his shoes lined up as if they had somewhere to be.\n\nWhen Sunday came, the city allowed itself a certain laxity in the angles of things. She went to the market and bought two apples that had decided to be old in an elegant way, and a small fish that looked like a confession and would later be delicious with lemon and a stubborn herb. She ran into the librarian buying mushrooms and they discussed the trophy\u2019s placement as if it were a student with needs. On her way home, she paused by the poster for the finals and this time did not look away immediately, allowing herself to see the strangers in their good architecture, and then allowing herself to be a little bored of them because she had come to believe in the usefulness of boredom as a weapon against envy.\n\nThat afternoon she wrote her grant application like a woman writing a love letter to a desk. She used the words people like to see when they must give money they would rather hoard: outreach, community, resilience, inclusivity, scaffolding, measurable. She made it honest where it could bear it and made it clever where honesty would bore, and when she had finished she read it aloud to the plants that had never asked anything of her but water and a certain dignity, and sent it, then stood and practiced not thinking about whether anyone would read the thing she had written. She had learned, over the years, that one cannot live awaiting replies without becoming a person whose face has no patience left in it, and she had decided, perhaps foolishly and certainly stubbornly, that she would rather have lines that showed the work of laughing.\n\nIn the evening, because celebration is a muscle you must use or lose, she put on the dress that was not the dress and went to the bar near the river where an accordion had taken up residence, and there she let herself be taken into three dances with a stranger whose hands were honest and whose breath was noisy, and into a fourth with a woman who led like a promise that wanted to be forgiven. Around her, the city made noises that had nothing to do with her and everything to do with what it means to be in a place with others, and she thought of the girls at the studio with their knees like breadsticks and the boys with their earbud catechisms, and of the way Camille had said she felt like a thief and a little like God. She went home with her ankles doing their commentary, and in the kitchen she ate the fish with lemon and the honest herb and let the juice run onto her wrist, and decided that the evening had been a small success in the direction of not asking every hour to give her a reason for itself.\n\nOn Monday, the laboratory of movement became not a plan but a door someone had opened, and six children walked through it as if they had been waiting outside for weeks. They came in pairs and alone, with shyness like a scarf around the neck and bravado like a hat worn too low. She moved the desks back, which made the room look briefly unemployed, and put on not music but a metronome that had once belonged to a piano teacher who wore pearls in solidarity with order. They began with the scandalous instruction to stand still and feel where their feet were, which made two boys giggle and a girl look dangerous, and then she had them walk to the far wall and back in silence as if the floor were someone who needed to be convinced. Someone asked if there would be prizes and she said yes, but not the kind that glitter, and she did not apologize for being mystical because children live in a world where mysticism is the only politics that makes sense.\n\nThey played the game where one person closes their eyes and another leads with the lightest touch of a finger on a sleeve, and when one of the boys tried to turn it into a slapstick, the girl from 5B who carried herself like a question mark said, without malice, that this was serious, and the boy made the face of someone discovering that seriousness is not a punishment. At the end, sweaty from nothing and flushed from permission, they sat cross-legged and she asked them to say one true thing about their bodies that was not an insult, and at first they resisted and then a small stampede of exhausted truth arrived\u2014my arms are good at carrying, my back hurts when I lie, my feet know the way home\u2014and she felt that bell in her chest move like a creature in a well.\n\nThe week smoothed itself into something like a promise that one could be borne. She and Rafa\u00ebl met in the evenings and developed the kind of confidentiality about exhaustion that people develop when they trust one another with ugliness. He came one night with a story about the job in Oullins in which a pipe had confessed to being older than the men responsible for it, and she came another with a story about a mother whose eyes had asked permission to cry while her mouth asked for grammar exercises for a child who ate paper, and between stories they moved, because that is what bodies do when words have run out of their usefulness.\n\nIn the small hours on Friday, waking because some neighbor\u2019s door had decided to be enthusiastic, she lay in the exact position she had lay in when she was ten and believed the ceiling must need her eyes to stay up, and she listened for the details that separate one insomnia from another. The city sent a siren and a laugh; her radiator rehearsed its clucks; a couple upstairs negotiated a silence; a cat on a wall decided against risk. She thought of the girl who had cried backstage and of Anne\u2019s jam and of the train with its confident face, and of Jules and his daughters with their lion-conquering, and of the old woman\u2019s hand at her sternum, and she began to imagine the room where the showcase would be, and the angle at which she would carry her shoulder into the second turn so that the strap would not argue, and the exact moment at which she would find Rafa\u00ebl\u2019s palm and let herself be led away from the fact that she would always have to ask some version of a stranger to trust her.\n\nBy the time the alarm performed its tiny marvel, her mind had already flown three circuits of a day, and still a kind of contentment was available to her as she dressed, in the form of a sweater that had not yet decided to betray her at the elbows and the knowledge that she had paid what she owed and was not being hunted by a piece of paper. She put the gladiators on the shelf beside the cheap potted plant she had once bought in pity and which now insisted upon being a tree, and she said good morning to both of them with a ridiculous courtesy, and then she went out to find the world in the mood for what she could bear to offer.Chapter 6\n\nThe week that followed put on an ordinary coat and then found a rose in its pocket, and the simple discovery made everything else smell faintly of patience. Mornings were back to being assemblies of damp scarves and low clouds with opinions, the Sa\u00f4ne practicing its restrained breathing between the stone shoulders that disciplined it, and her feet learned the winter route again, which involved exactly two puddles, a bakery window with a charitable \u00e9clair, and the butcher\u2019s fennel that insisted on appearing in every season as if it had an appointment with her lungs. The little gladiators took to their shelf in the staff room with an air of having been sent ahead to reserve a table for victory, and the plant beside them, encouraged by this brass companionship, produced one surprised leaf that Renaud claimed to have coaxed with Handel and a speech about excellence. She took pleasure in the stiff routines because they allowed her to hide bits of brightness inside them like postcards slipped into thick books, and because after the kind of night where applause still lives in the body as a new organ, one needs somewhere to put the organ down for a while without breaking it.\n\nThe movement laboratory became a regular appointment, which is to say it became complicated in the way commitments become complicated as soon as they acquire their own furniture. At the second session, a very small boy named Farid, who was the size of an object one might place deliberately on a bookshelf, arrived with a letter from his mother signed with five different loops and an insistence that he would not, could not, should not remove his shoes in public, and she wrote back in the elegant neutral of a teacher\u2019s note that he could keep his shoes on so long as he promised to learn to feel his feet without anyone else seeing him do it. The girl from 5B who had looked dangerous last week arrived wearing defiance that had been ironed, and when the boys made jokes about touching with a fingertip she suggested, with a perfectly pleasant voice, that anyone who giggled at permission would not be included in the part where the music came in. By the end of the hour, the floor had given up its indifference, and when she told them to walk as if the world were listening and they were saying something true with their knees, they tried, and in trying made a sound that could not be heard except by the dust.\n\nAt school as in life, small accommodations took on the look of progress. The headmaster sent a message with the kind of subject line one writes to oneself in hope\u2014funding possibility, movement\u2014and she met him in his office where a bowl of citrus tried to make a philosophy of freshness. Together they coaxed her grant application into a form that did not scare committees and did not disgust her, adding a paragraph about how bodies that understand themselves tend to harm others less, and subtracting a sentence she had loved about the way a metronome can act as a friend. He told her about a boy he had once taught who had taken up the bassoon to avoid violence, and she told him about a girl who had traded silence for a step, and between them the room acquired a temperate hope, which is the only kind that lasts. When she left, he pressed three photocopy tokens into her palm as if they were coins to cross a river, and she thanked him with more feeling than the coins deserved because, often, it is not the object but the shared belief in it that makes it holy.\n\nRafa\u00ebl, meanwhile, acquired an injury with theatrical modesty. At the site near Oullins, a coil of copper, affronted by its own stubbornness, had snapped back and found his wrist with the unerring nose of humiliation, leaving a half-moon bruise that looked like punctuation. He texted a photograph of it that made the hand appear both heroic and ridiculous, and when she met him at the studio he offered up the offended limb with a comic solemnity that made her want to blow on it as if he were a child and she possessed a mother\u2019s breath. The injury was not ruinous, but it asked for respect, and respect in dance is often the difference between pretended leadership and actual listening. They learned, therefore, a slightly different grammar of their partnership, one in which his left hand\u2019s insistence softened into a question and her back, which had long practiced polite obedience, took on a little more decision, and it occurred to her that this was a lesson about more than bones and sinew, though she did not say it because people become unkind when they are offered metaphors about themselves before they have asked.\n\nThe showcase that Giraud had promised became a date that sat up straight on the calendar, and the email with its unmatched fonts and its enthusiastic list of \u201copportunities for visibility\u201d did its best to be both a promise and a threat. She filled out the release forms with a pen that had survived the lives of five faculties, and tried not to be too amused by the phrase \u201cby participating you agree to be seen,\u201d which seemed to her both honest and indecent. Anne wrote to say she would be there with a needle and an opinion, and in the same breath asked, in her majestic way, if she might borrow \u00c9lise\u2019s kitchen on Sunday to make a jam that required the kind of patience none of her lovers could be trusted to demonstrate. \u201cI will pay with sugar and a counsel you will not take,\u201d Anne wrote, and \u00c9lise laughed in the empty room and sent back her address like a performance schedule. It occurred to her that one of the great luxuries of being an adult is deciding which fervent instructions to disobey.\n\nCamille brought both poems and a face that had discovered that ambition does not always look like a horse one can ride; sometimes it looks like a room that has not been aired. They sat with the pages and the invisible lamp they moved between them whenever they used words like tenderness and necessary, and a disagreement about whether brackets should be allowed to exist in a poem took on the contour of a debate about whether a person ought to narrate their own forgiveness while doing the forgiving. Camille, who had a mother with many sentences living inside her and a father who had become a parenthesis, argued for the brackets, and \u00c9lise argued for their absence while confessing to a private love of parentheses, and in the end they invented a compromise that was not really a compromise but an invitation to write two poems again. \u201cYou are exhausting,\u201d Camille declared with a smile that forecast a life of specific insistence, and \u00c9lise told her that exhaustion was simply the name for the feeling of having lived inside one\u2019s work for a while without opening a window, and that it could be survived with fruit and laughter.\n\nOne afternoon, after a lesson in which the subjunctive convinced several children that French was unfair for having invented a mood that punished people for dreaming aloud, she found herself at the cemetery without having planned it, which is often how one comes to see the dead when one intends only a longer walk. The rows of names did the quiet labor of reminding the living that other people have had days, and more than once her feet stopped and her eyes read someone else\u2019s age as if it were a price she might be willing to pay. Her mothers lay under a stone they had chosen together when the younger one was still convinced of a long career in laughter, and the older had insisted on something plain, because even her grief had been allergic to ostentation. She sat on the low wall and told them the news the way a child tells invisible friends a secret, not because she expected an answer but because the act itself made the air less empty. She told them about Paris in the voice she reserved for things that tried to be both miraculous and bureaucratic, she told them about the lab and the boy who had learned not to giggle at being led, she told them about Jules and his apology that had been short and sincere, and then she told them about the rent and how very grown she had felt handing over an envelope like a person in a film. The wind was industrious, moving low branches and small regrets, and when she stood she felt lighter in exactly the way one does when a bag has been taken off the shoulder and forgotten for half a block.\n\nThe interview for the showcase was scheduled for a Thursday night in a room that had been a canteen and now tried to be a studio with the help of three cheap lights and a young woman with a microphone that had opinions. The questions were the kind that want to be short answers and become long if you happen to be honest, and the cameraman, who had hair arranged like a decision, asked them to be more emotional and then less, and then to try something in which they felt \u201cconnected\u201d though not \u201cdependent,\u201d and she and Rafa\u00ebl exchanged the look of two people who have shared an absurdity before and agreed silently to behave. When it was her turn to speak alone, she said a sentence about the way movement had been the boat she had not known she had built, and another about how teaching sometimes felt like taking dictation from a group mind that did not know its own beauty, and when she began to say a third that involved the word salvation she stopped herself because she did not want to frighten the microphone. Rafa\u00ebl, in his turn, admitted to having learned tenderness from wood and wire, and said, with a gentle bravado, that a good lead is a conversation and a poor one an order, and \u00c9lise looked at him and did not say that she had been waiting to hear that from a man since she was the size of an adjective.\n\nOn Friday, Jules arrived with the girls again because they had discovered that a funicular is a machine that can be loved like a pet, and this time he brought their mother\u2014their mother by virtue of the children and the kitchen table, not because the universe had given her any paper to prove it\u2014who had been the cord around which his life had been braided for a decade. She was a woman with a surgical humor and an unreasonable kindness toward chairs, and she received \u00c9lise with a scrutiny that was affectionate and a little dangerous, as if she were measuring her not for a dress but for a future conversation that would include the word stubborn. Over coffees that behaved like citizens, they spoke about the stupid magnificence of cities, and about the school\u2019s decision to cut field trips, and then the woman took the girls to watch a street musician whose instrument accepted griefs for money, and Jules and \u00c9lise were left in a square of afternoon in which they could afford to finish a sentence. He told her he had lain awake the night before thinking about the line in Camille\u2019s poem about the jacket, because even though he did not know the girl he had recognized in it the look their father used to have when he came home from a day spent selling people the idea of certainty and could not find a place for his own uncertainty to sit. She told him she had dreamed of a room full of her mother\u2019s hair and that the dream had not been cruel, only insistent, and he put his hand on the table and she put hers over it and for a moment it was as if they had managed to be their own parents and forgive themselves for the hours they had not managed to save.\n\nThe dress behaved in rehearsal as if it had been raised well. Anne, possessed by a benevolent tyranny, pinned it into obedience with such efficiency that the garment seemed grateful, and she left \u00c9lise\u2019s kitchen smelling like sugar that had reconsidered its life and a citrus that had decided it could not go on unless it was boiled. They ate bread with a jam that tasted like a decision not to apologize, and Anne told stories about stages that had refused to behave and how one must be polite to a board even when it creaks insults, and she gave \u00c9lise a small pin in the shape of a star with one crooked point, saying in a voice that did not mind being theatrical that it had belonged to her grandmother who had danced once in Poland because a man in a hat had told her he could not promise to love her but could promise to watch with kindness. The star was not valuable and its crookedness made it look as if it had survived an argument, and \u00c9lise pinned it to the inside of the dress where only she would know it lived, because there are talismans one must wear close to skin and not advertise to fate.\n\nThe night of the showcase arrived with an edge, the way music halls collect weather around their doors. The Carr\u00e9 had decided to be generous, and backstage the seamstresses conducted their perennial debate about whether bias cuts were the invention of a genius or a saboteur, and several men made it their duty to count cables in different directions. There was a small mishap, because stages have their sense of humor, and twenty minutes before they were called a portion of the lights executed a meaningful flicker and then gave up, forcing a man with a calm moustache to become a hero with a ladder while someone else delivered a speech to the fuse box about perseverance. Anne padded about with her pins like a person charged with keeping planets in their orbits, and when the stage manager came to tell them that the lights could be persuaded to be faithful but not entirely obedient, they looked at each other and agreed in that quiet way that they would dance like people who have learned at last how to be looked at in the dark.\n\nThey were given a slot early, which meant the audience\u2019s attention was still thirsty and not yet sophisticated with expectations. The music came in clean and then disappeared once, as if embarrassed to be caught assisting, and the darkness in that moment was not complete but sufficient to make them more important to themselves, and in the half-light she could see the edge of the stage like a sentence that had been cut short and had to be guessed. He tightened the connection at her back by a shade, and she let her ribs listen to his breath, and together they made the adjustments that all intimacy requires when the room changes its mind about permission. The last turn, their friend and their treachery, arrived at exactly the right moment and accepted their offering of ankles and trust, and when the lights returned entirely at the end, as if apologizing for their earlier whim, they found the two of them in that posture just after the bow where one is both naked and armored, and the applause did not have the frantic stupidity of competition; it had instead the texture of relief, like water after salt.\n\nIn the quiet room afterward where the recorded interviews would be spliced into each other and uploaded to hungry places, a young woman from a local channel asked her what she would say to her younger self if she could go back and advise her before she decided to begin late. She said, carefully and then not careful at all, that she would tell the girl that lateness is a kind of style and that shame is a poor instructor, and that if you wait to be invited you will spend your life holding your breath in doorways, and the girl with the microphone made a noise of polite enthusiasm and then a real noise, the kind people make when an answer reminds them of a thing they have been pretending not to want. Later, when the video appeared in a corner of the internet that was not inhospitable, she watched herself in the brightness and felt both deadly earnest and ridiculous, and she decided to love herself in the clip with the same practiced generosity she extended to the children when their mouths forgot how to be brave.\n\nThe week after, a man from the municipal cultural center called with a question that sounded like an opportunity wearing comfortable shoes. Would she, he asked with the brisk humility of someone who has been told \u201cno\u201d very often, consider leading a short series of movement sessions for adults who had misplaced their bodies somewhere in the years between chores and catastrophe? There was not much money, there was never much money, but there was enough to buy peaches for a month and to pay for a pair of shoes that did not make the knees regret hope, and the classes would be on a Tuesday evening in a room that had once been used to teach circle dances and then used to store chairs and would now be pressed into service as mercy. She said yes because the part of her that makes lists nodded and because the part of her that lives in ankles clapped, and then she hung up and let herself be foolish in the hallway, weaving between the shadow of the coat rack and the washing machine with a move that had no name and did not need one.\n\nAt school, the movement laboratory discovered that children enjoy teaching more than being taught, and she spent a joyful session watching a boy instruct a girl in the art of not flinching when someone places a hand between your shoulder blades to tell you which way the music goes, a lesson that should be taught in every school by law. The librarian moved the gladiators to a higher shelf because a younger class had tried to use them as chess pieces and invented, in the process, a war between verbs and nouns that ended with the verb fleeing on a dinosaur, and he asked her if she wanted the trophy back and she told him to keep it hostage a little longer so that she might collect the pleasure of seeing it during passing moments when she needed to remember that brass can be a kind of kindness. Renaud was still in love with the idea of being of use, and began, spontaneously, to bring her small presents of competence\u2014a sharpened pencil at the exact time she lost her own, a photocopy that had collated itself, a cap on a pen that matched\u2014until she told him, with an affection that bordered on gratitude, that she could survive without being rescued so long as he continued to tell her stories in which he, by accident, became a hero in the medley of administrative incompetences.\n\nThere was, of course, a bill that wanted to be the antagonist in a story that did not require one, and on a Tuesday afternoon the envelope that arrived with the modest thud of bureaucracy demanded money for something she had not known she was using\u2014some line of internet that had been attached to something else, or a charge that had been explained in a tone that frightened her into agreement. She felt the old vertigo and sat on the edge of the bed to make the room sit down with her, then did the grown thing of calling and waiting and negotiating without crying, and in the silence between the hold music and the human voice she recited to herself the declaration Anne had made about old boards and the way one must be polite even to the things that ruin your heels. When a person finally answered, he turned out to be a boy who loved football and who admitted, after three minutes, that the fee was designed to discourage despair and could be removed if one remembered to ask, and she thanked him so sincerely that he laughed and told her she could call back any time to talk about chickens, which she decided not to analyze.\n\nOn a Thursday that tasted like metal, she watched the video of the showcase at her desk between classes, and a girl who was supposed to be finding the subjunctive instead found the clip and, seeing her teacher moving like someone with permission, put her hand to her mouth and asked, in a whisper that had disobedience and admiration in it, how one acquired such a back. \u201cBy carrying too many books and then deciding to carry none,\u201d she said, and the girl nodded as if this were practical. A parent wrote a polite message asking whether the club encouraged \u201cexpressiveness that might distract from examination rigor,\u201d and she wrote back that expressive people tend to survive examinations with their souls intact and that a child who can stand still when asked will not, in fact, ruin a classroom by discovering the metronome that lives in their ribs. The parent responded with a line about budgets and standards that had surely been copied from a publication, and \u00c9lise put the phone down and went to the lab and taught six children how to walk a line without looking at their feet.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the cultural center held a small orientation that involved pastries behaving like ambassadors, and she sat in a circle of folding chairs with a shy retired dancer who had a knee like an old door, a man who had come because he had been told by a doctor to \u201creconnect\u201d and had decided that the word, if not the act, appealed to him, a young woman whose hair was a protest and who wore anger like a borrowed coat, and two mothers who wanted to discover whether there was space beneath duty for breath. They began by sitting silently until someone laughed because silence in groups is offensive to the human appetite, and then she spoke about what the floor asked for from them and what it did not, and about what bravery looks like when no one is watching, and then they stood and took four steps and stopped and took two steps back, and in the disorder of the small moves she saw people being generous with their injuries and with their pride. At the end, the man with the knee asked if the exit would be painful, and she told him yes, but that the pain would teach them the way home, and he nodded as if he had been waiting for someone to make even one promise that was not an advertisement.\n\nThat evening, a rain came that thought itself more important than it was, and the city became glossy and melancholy in the way of things that have performed this trick too often and still get away with it. She and Rafa\u00ebl practiced the section they had abandoned years ago because it had humiliated them in front of a mirror, and this time the mirror, having watched them suffer other humiliations with grace, decided to be cordial. He told her about a cousin who had phoned from a job site in Toulouse where they needed men who could be trusted to find leaks that did not want to be found, and she heard in his voice the preparation for leaving that some men carry around like a toolkit. He did not ask her to tell him not to go; she did not tell him she would be angry if he stayed out of habit; they simply measured the space between his wrist and the idea of a new city, and then they danced the kind of practice that says we will survive this conversation later without a stage.\n\nOn Sunday, the old woman with the fuchsia backpack appeared like an appointment kept by fate, her bun tighter than her arguments, and insisted on taking \u00c9lise for a coffee she could not afford and for which she paid with a grand gesture that made the coins look like theater. She told \u00c9lise she had once had a pin that brought her luck until she lost it on the bus to Charpennes and that afterward everything in her life had continued as normal and yet a small door had remained closed for a long time because objects sometimes carry the permission that people refuse to give themselves. \u00c9lise told her about the crooked star and the woman who had bequeathed it, and the old woman, pleased as if twins had discovered each other in a shop, took her hand without warning and pressed her palm to the table and tapped once with her finger where the bell lived. \u201cIt is still ringing,\u201d she said in a tone that admitted an almost superstitious satisfaction, and \u00c9lise, surprised to find that this assessment comforted her, agreed.\n\nAt the end of the month, when the cultural center sent a poster with her name in a font that had not been made to flatter the poor and the brave, she stuck it to her refrigerator with a magnet shaped like a pear and felt, for a moment, the kind of pride that does not brag because it is too busy preparing the chairs. She had the laboratory on Mondays, the adults on Tuesdays, her own practice on Fridays because Wednesday and Thursday belonged to being tired, and on Saturdays the invigilations would come like slow trains, and she could see a season arranged not like a trap but like a scaffolding. In the spaces left between, there were children who asked if the future could be written in a tense they liked, and a brother who was learning how to owe and be owed affection without turning that into mathematics, and a man who might go to Toulouse and whose wrist had healed sufficiently for him to be negligent of it again, and a city that persisted in being a place where women could walk at night with a small fear and a small joy and arrive home with both.\n\nWhen sleep was slow to find her, she lay on her back and let her ankles tell the story of the day to her knees while the radiator rehearsed its jokes, and she thought about the problem of deserving and the solution of persistence, and about how sometimes a life feels like a hall that refuses your shoes and then, by way of some administrative error or grace, admits you with an apology and a chair. She did not make plans bigger than a month because everything larger than that has always felt like hubris and budget, but she let herself picture a year in which the lab survived inspection and the adults laughed at their own seriousness and she bought lemons without looking at their price, and in which she allowed herself to imagine that the bell at her sternum would continue to ring not with the clang of alarms but with the low, friendly insistence of a town clock that knows everyone\u2019s names. Outside, a bus sighed and a woman laughed at a joke the night had told her, and the sound slid in through the small opening in the window and made a place for itself on the shelf beside the gladiators, and she slept with her hand on the crooked star through the thin fabric as if she were a girl who had smuggled home a secret and intended, stubbornly, to keep it.Chapter 8\n\nWinter did not ask permission; it clamped itself over the city with the quiet certainty of a lid finding its pot, and the Sa\u00f4ne took on that particular fatigue that makes water look like metal. In the mornings, the damp became less tender, choosing instead to be factual; her scarf learned a new tightness and the fennel behind the butcher turned suddenly medicinal, as if it had been hired for its virtues. The bell at her sternum did not stop; it lowered its note until it could be felt in the bones of her wrists when she lifted her mug. On a Tuesday that had more gray than hours, Rafa\u00ebl told her in the studio with his hands at his pockets as if he had been instructed to behave himself that the job in Toulouse had turned from rumor to train ticket. He spoke with that deliberate cheerfulness some men build when they have dragged a decision across every room in their heads, and she listened with the particular kind of attention she reserves for people she is determined not to make into enemies. \u201cSix weeks,\u201d he said, and the number was both small and unbearable. They considered, in the way dancers measure distances without moving, how far six weeks is for a body that is used to being found by the same palm between the shoulder blades, and then they began to talk about times and trains, and who would take care of the plants in his kitchen, and whether he should try the place with the inexpensive rooms near the station or accept his cousin\u2019s offer of a couch and a constant argument.\n\nAt the coll\u00e8ge, the laboratory acquired a visitor\u2019s chair and a visitor to sit in it, because the headmaster had mentioned the word \u201coversight\u201d in a meeting and the word had grown fruit. The woman from the committee wore a navy dress that had been asked to look impartial and a scarf that had been asked to look like a personality, and she smiled with a firmness that dared you to disappoint her. \u00c9lise had put away her metaphors and lined up her verbs; she plastered the walls with the language of outcomes, and on the board drew the skeleton of her hour so that a person who mistrusted the art might at least appreciate the architecture. At the beginning, the children were loud and then not; Farid refused to remove his shoes in a way that was dignified rather than defensive, and the older girl, whose defiance had become a garment she wore with increasing accuracy, took the boy\u2019s hand in the eyes-closed walk and led him with such fierce delicacy that the committee scarf drooped. Halfway through, while they practiced the scandal of standing still and feeling where their feet were without naming it confession, the woman\u2019s pen stopped moving as if someone had pressed a finger to its mouth. In the little debriefing that followed, the visitor said she had expected \u201cmovement\u201d to be more exhausting and less quiet, and \u00c9lise, resisting the invitation to witty cruelty, spoke instead about how a body is a city of negotiations and that teaching a child to read their own signals reduces the need to shout later. The next day, an email arrived with the committee\u2019s boiled language approving a pilot extension, and Renaud pinned it to the noticeboard with a flourish as if it were the declaration of a small republic, adding a doodle of a pair of feet in the margin that made the headmaster wince and then pretend not to have seen.\n\nThe adults on Tuesday evenings brought with them the smell of their days, which were varied and specific\u2014metal and flour and antiseptic and the ghost of cigarettes that had not, in fact, been smoked. The young woman with protest for hair stood at the edge as if daring the floor to humiliate her personally, and when she was asked simply to walk she burst into a laugh that was too bright to be a laugh. They did not coo at her, because pity is nothing but a mirror held too close; instead, they let her walk badly until her shoulders felt the indecency of carrying so much, and then she allowed, in a tiny surrender that felt like a secret, to be led for three steps by the retired dancer with the knee as if the old woman\u2019s years could be borrowed for a minute like a cardigan against a draft. After class, the man ordered by a doctor to reconnect stayed to wash the cups as if paying reparations to the sink, and told her, without looking up, that his wife had wanted to learn tango and then had instead learned how to die, and he wanted to know if a person who had never held a body properly could still earn the right to try. She answered that permission is not a prize awarded for excellence but a fact one asserts and honors, and that the floor had no memory of their previous failures, and he nodded with that brittle gratitude of people who have built whole afternoons on the hope that someone will not scold them.\n\nCamille arrived one morning with eyes that had decided to be new. She said she had shown the poem to her mother and to her father separately and that in between the two showings she had written another poem that had no jacket in it at all, and that afterwards she had vomited because the body sometimes refuses to be interrupted while it is becoming. There was a small contest at the municipal library with a glass prize that made books look like a religion, and Camille had put her name down with an indifference that betrayed her blood. They discussed nerves as an animal one can feed wisely; they practiced reading the lines aloud at different temperatures, and \u00c9lise tried to assume the expression that would make the girl believe in her own mouth. On the day of the reading, the child stood on a low platform with a potted fern that resembled a minor judge and said the line about the jacket in a voice that did not apologize for its audacity, and a woman in the third row who had come primarily to argue with the prizes dabbed her eyes and later pretended the air had been dusty. Camille did not win; she came second to a boy who had written a beautiful lie about a city he had never visited, and on the way out she whispered to \u00c9lise that even not winning had felt good in her throat.\n\nThey did the practical work of departure without naming it grief. He brought the suitcase to her apartment one evening because its wheels were better on her stairs than his, and because handing a person weight is a way of asking them to bless you without saying the word. He gave her a key that did not belong to him but to a cabinet in the studio where he kept a hoard of things people who are always mending must hoard\u2014electrical tape and bandages and a string that believed itself useful\u2014and told her to take whatever she needed without asking because leaving sometimes requires you to pretend that generosity is a system. On the platform, the train made that show of being coy before opening its mouth to accept him; he kissed her once on each cheek and once in the middle of the air, and then he put his forehead to hers in a gesture that would have made a romance out of them if it had belonged to different people. \u201cI will send you a picture of every leak,\u201d he said, and she said she would send him a picture of her ankle whenever it behaved itself, and then they laughed too loudly because there was water very near the rim of both of them and anyone can see it when the surface trembles. When the train did its trick of leaving while making you believe you were the one who moved, she felt a single foolish tear make an expedition down her nose and onto her lip, and she licked it away with the mindless practicality of a person who has decided to survive.\n\nAlone on the floor, the mirror became less forgiving and more faithful. Without the specific conversation of his hand asking and her back answering, she found that the room had become populated by pasts\u2014errors she had catalogued and resentments she had managed like pot plants. She practiced the first six bars with the minimal civility of a person doing their duty and found herself stalled at the place where the turn had always been a problem, as if problems have their own gravity. There is a comedy in practicing with absence; she could feel the ghost of his palm and almost turn into it, and then she had to teach her muscles not to anticipate charity. The crooked star pressed against her skin under the ordinary shirt like a punctuation mark reminding a sentence of its job; she moved and the star moved and a friendship formed between them that had nothing to do with belief and everything to do with continuity. After an hour, when the body is done pretending it will not cooperate, when the knees have filed their complaints and been heard, she made the turn alone with the precision of a woman placing a cup on a saucer in a room where the child sleeps, and the relief was so unreasonable that she leaned her forehead for a second against the cold mirror and thanked the stupid wall for its attention.\n\nIn the small bureaucratic theater of her life, a pleasing farce occurred: the grant came through. It arrived with an email that confessed itself unexpectedly enthusiastic and a PDF that had been saved too many times with different names, and it promised an amount that did not suggest wealth but did suggest persistence might yet be rewarded in this century. She took the news to the librarian because some men can be trusted with joy, and he made her a coffee that did not offend her tongue and said he had always suspected committees were capable of mercy if they were presented with the right adjectives. Renaud threw an arm in the air and declared himself Treasurer of Something, and they laughed because words have always been richer than budgets. She walked home and bought lemons without her breath changing and allowed herself, in so small a decadence it felt almost like a trick, to add a bunch of parsley to the basket because one should teach the refrigerator that color is not an emergency. That evening she wrote to Anne that they ought to waste sugar again, and Anne replied with three ideas and an insult about a critic that promised an afternoon of pleasure.\n\nBecause the universe enjoys both symmetry and mischief, she lost the star. It was a mean, quick loss; she had pinned it as always to the inside of her practice shirt and then, after a class in which the boys had discovered the word \u201csuspension\u201d and made it into a physical comedy she had admired against her will, she found her fingers touching only cotton. The panic was not dignified; she searched the bag and the floor and the cruel gap between bench and wall where small objects go to become historical. She retraced her steps through the studio and then to the tram and then to her kitchen, where she looked in the sink because one always looks in the sink, as if the metal might confess to harboring a saint. She went to bed with that hollow between ribs that arrives when a thing you have chosen to believe in goes out without leaving a note, and in the morning she made herself put on her shoes without ceremony and went down to the landlady\u2019s, because courage sometimes looks like doing the day\u2019s stupid things while remembering to say good morning. In the afternoon, while hanging a shirt to dry, she found the star clinging to the inside seam with the ridiculous tenacity of a flea, and she laughed so loudly that the neighbor\u2019s boy peeked through the stair rail to confirm she was alone. She pinned it back with a ferocity that would have frightened a larger jewel, and she scolded it because scolding amulets is foolish and unresisted, and she wore it for the rest of the day even while teaching about prepositions, a fact of which the children were cheerfully ignorant and which improved her mood to an indecent degree.\n\nRenaud, who had fallen in love with competence and then with an opera singer, fell out of love with ease not at all. He arrived one morning in a tie that had not been bullied into cleverness and the eyes of a man who had received a sentence without a verb. Anne had decided that the part of her life in which he had been central must now be remodeled without him, and in the staff room he wavered between eulogy and joke with that dangerous charm people cling to when their grief is new and frightened. She made him tea that tasted of the alphabet and sat with him while he invented versions of himself he might become\u2014ascetic, lothario, beekeeper\u2014and when he had finished she suggested librarian as a temporary vocation and movement assistant as a permanent one. He said the second was absurd and then, to her mild surprise, changed his mind halfway to the bin to throw away the tea bag, because watching children tell the truth with their shoulders had done something to the part of him that usually performed competence until it became a mask. Later that week, he appeared at her lab with a playlist that did not apologize for existing and an offer to count, and she allowed him to, and the numbers he said aloud had a steadiness that made the children taller.\n\nThe first snow came mid-lesson like a rumor that turned out to be exact. Someone shrieked the way people do when the air gives them an excuse, and they all went to the window as if it had been written in the curriculum. The flakes were not serious; they were the scouts of an army that might or might not be interested in laying siege to the city, and the courtyard responded by becoming briefly very handsome. She looked at the headmaster through the glass of his office door and he looked back at her and made the small face that principals make when asked for permission to break a rule that is not meant to protect anything important. \u201cFive minutes,\u201d he said, as if the number could contain joy, and she took them all outside and made them walk in a line along the edge of the gritted path with exaggerated slowness while their boots wrote a sentence the snow half-read. The girl with the dangerous shoulders declared that snow itself was a kind of silence that wanted to be listened to, and Farid announced that he had decided to remove his shoes when he felt like it and not a second before, and she told them to breathe because nothing improves an afternoon more cheaply than breathing together in cold air.\n\nAt night, when the world goes quiet over debts and dinners, Toulouse came to her telephone, and the phone lit her face the way all lonely cities resemble each other. He called from a room with a curtain that no one had ever meant to buy, and in the square of the screen his smile did its best to be sure of itself. He showed her a blister on a finger that had been bitten by a wire with opinions, and a sandwich so inadequate it had begun to apologize in advance, and an apartment block across the courtyard where a couple argued so patiently it made him want to applaud. Sometimes they spoke with scarecrow lightness, and sometimes they allowed the thread to carry quiet over hundreds of kilometers without insisting on filling it, and then she would walk with the phone pressed to her ear to her window, and he would listen to the sound of her radiator\u2019s arrogance as if it were proof that he would be permitted to come back. The first Sunday, he sent a photograph of a leak that had given up its location with theatrical reluctance, annotated with arrows and a drawing of a fish, and she replied with a video of her ankle behaving itself in a circle and the star lying on her palm like an accomplice. They hung up when the connection began to fragment his vowels into birds, and afterwards she stood with her face close to the cold of the window until the city gave her back to herself.\n\nThere were days when the bell at her sternum rang so low she worried she\u2019d mistaken it for a dull ache; there were days it chimed at a pitch that made the glass on the shelf hum along, which is a ridiculous thing to say out loud and entirely true. The cultural center\u2019s posters appeared in the world and she saw her own name next to words like \u201ccommunity\u201d and \u201cembodiment,\u201d and she felt both flattered and hunted. An old man came to class wearing a suit because the idea of exercise offended him and left wearing a sweater because the idea had apologized and then been permitted to enter; a woman confessed to having danced at weddings only behind pillars and was witnessed out in the open by strangers who did not make a joke of her. After one such class, the protest-haired girl approached and asked what to do when she looked at herself and hated the arrangement of things in an almost professional way, and \u00c9lise told her to make the mirror work for its wage and to stand so close to the glass it could not find all of her at once, and that in the end a person must decide who is the customer in that transaction. They laughed, and the girl tried, and afterward she wrote a message that said only \u201cI am still here,\u201d which was either nothing or the thing itself.\n\nA small embarrassment went round the staff room when a parent complained that the laboratory had resulted in their child\u2019s unusual determination to walk too slowly in supermarkets, as if the aisles had become an audience. The headmaster forwarded the message with a subject line scaffolding\u2014concern, which made her fond of him because everyone deserves a little theater in their caution. She wrote back to the parent with all the charm she could afford that there were worse rebellions than making the world wait for a person who was learning to take up their own time, and the parent replied, unexpectedly, that the boy had started making tea and that perhaps the connection was not coincidental. Renaud made a poster for the lab that featured a drawing of feet reading a book, and he hung it under a crooked notice about detentions that had remained crooked for such a long time that the crookedness had become part of the aesthetic. She made him straighten it because there are rules one must obey even when one is busy inventing others.\n\nOn a Thursday near the end of term, when everyone is too tired to pretend they like each other and therefore can be liked, she found herself in the park under the chestnuts just before evening, because she had taken the long way home in order to prove she did not belong entirely to the grids of the day. She watched a boy teach his father how to throw a paper plane with the correct sticking-out tongue, and a woman argue with a dog about mud as if the animal understood the politesse of flooring, and she thought about the year that had been too much of everything and somehow also parsimonious with miracles. The star lay obediently against her sternum; the gladiators had collected a thin layer of dust in the staff room, which made them look older and therefore more credible; the lab had a budget that would not survive a hungry committee but might survive careful stapling; Camille had a new poem that refused to behave and might become a life. When she got home, she found a package under the door from Anne containing two jars of jam labeled with handwriting that had a bias toward melodrama\u2014one read Winter Citrus for Courage, the other read Bitter Peel for Truth\u2014and a note that said, simply, eat the second when you are infuriated by the first.\n\nThat night the dream arrived again, with the hall and the floor that tolerated only her feet, but this time the chairs were occupied by her living\u2014the librarian, Renaud, the girl with the protest hair, the old woman with the fuchsia backpack, the headmaster pretending not to be moved, Jules with a child on each knee, Anne with her pins like medals, and, in a deep shadow where one is not expected to identify one\u2019s devils, her mother, who looked neither approving nor discouraging but attentive in a way that felt more like friendship than review. She woke in the place just before her clock had been asked to perform its small act of heroism, and lay with the knowledge that sleep had not betrayed her by telling her unuseful truths. The radiator argued with itself without taking sides; the city outside made its quiet inventory of lamps and cats and buses; her body rehearsed the mild ache of being a person who has used it. She put her hand to her sternum, felt the bell\u2019s long note, and considered, briefly and then persistently, that perhaps the door she had spent her life tapping at had not been opened by someone else but by her knuckles having knocked a groove into it at last. She got up because mornings hold their own kind of ceremony, and because tea does not make itself, and because there would be children to teach to walk slower and a man to call in another city where the curtains still had not chosen to be beautiful, and because cost and joy had their account to reconcile in the ledger she carried around like a private book of hours.Chapter 10\n\nFebruary had a way of arranging itself like a badly folded map, all creases in the wrong directions, and she walked through it with the tolerant irritation one reserves for furniture that cannot be moved. The river took on the posture of a patient in a waiting room, determined to appear untroubled, and the air acquired that taste of wet keys that winter dispenses when it wants to remind you who is in charge of locks. She tied her scarf with the firmness of someone closing an argument and counted, without admitting it to herself, the mornings until the first daffodil would be reckless on the quai. The bell at her sternum continued its plain work, so steady now that she could measure the day by its hum, and she had the absurd thought that if she put her ear against the window she would hear the city ring back.\n\nThe laboratory had become a country with customs and, inevitably, smuggling. A boy tried to bring swagger across the border and had it confiscated at the door but, uninspected, kindness slipped through in his pockets; a girl attempted, unsuccessfully, to hide her need for applause inside disdain, and another girl spotted it and held it up to the light like a jewel in a pawnshop. On the third Monday, they attempted the technique of leaving space between steps not as negligence but as offer, and it turned into a minor theology when Farid, who had finally taken off his shoes in a silent ceremony that involved knotting his laces with dignity and placing them side by side as if they were friends, declared that the empty parts were the best because you could sit down inside them without anyone seeing. She wanted to clap and did not, because you must not reward children for discovering something they cannot yet protect; instead she taught them the practical trick of counting silence as if it were a note. The committee lady returned, scarf subdued, and stayed longer than her schedule would have wished, her pen making more pauses than words.\n\nCamille arrived one morning with a bruise under her sleeve that was not a bruise but a blue ink stain from a pen that had exploded while she was writing in bed, and her face had that satisfied exhaustion of someone who has argued with themselves and not lost. She produced a poem that refused to end where she had meant it to, and they laughed over its insubordination and agreed to let it have the last word for a while. When the municipal library published the list of finalists for the glass prize, Camille\u2019s name had mischief in its vowels, and her mother sent a message to say she would attend with a stoic coat and a resolve not to say anything injurious about metaphors in public. The reading itself was lit with that inexpensive brightness that makes everyone look briefly like someone else, and Camille\u2019s voice had found the height at which it could speak without arousing the suspicion of the ceiling. She did not win, which was correct because winning would have made her insufferable for a fortnight, but afterward a woman with hair like punctuation came and told her she had done something honest to an afternoon, and the girl measured the sentence as if it were fabric she could use later.\n\nToulouse tattooed itself into Rafa\u00ebl\u2019s messages with the cheap ink of temporary lodgings\u2014curtains the color of disappointment, a kettle that took offense if filled past its line, a neighbor who sang softly and could not carry a tune even through a thin wall. He called from streets with names that had opinions, and once from a bar where a man told a joke about electricity that could not be translated without being killed. The job, of course, tried to grow; it insisted on an extra two weeks in a tone of voice the foreman called unavoidable and that reminded her of the phrase we have no choice used politely as an instrument. He rehearsed leaving again without complaint, and she practiced the art of not making a friend into a martyr by praising his absence too eloquently. When he sent a photograph of his wrist healed to the color of a lesson learned, she replied with a photograph of the crooked star resting on her sternum like a punctuation mark that had decided not to move, and he texted back a small constellation made of dots and dashes and a fish because there are love languages that are not languages and ought not to be named.\n\nThere are, inside schools, small storms that never make the news, and one gathered in the staff room over paper cups and the smell of coffee that was trying to forgive itself. A parent wrote to the committee to say the laboratory had emboldened her child to sway in the aisle of the supermarket while choosing yogurt, which she found extravagant and, perhaps, communist. The headmaster, who had learned from years of bats in attics that fear can climb through any crack, forwarded the message with a sigh that had practiced being dignified. \u00c9lise drafted a reply that used words like proprioception and attention economy and then deleted it because both words would turn into weapons when repeated in kitchens and on buses, and instead wrote that the boy would grow up into a person who could stand in a line without resenting the stranger in front of him, and that the country would be better for it. The parent, unexpectedly, responded that he had, in fact, helped an old woman reach the top shelf where the jam lived, and that perhaps this was what they were paying for after all, and she printed the missile and pinned it under the gladiators because not all victories have trumpets and most deserve shelves.\n\nA small celebration in late afternoon was arranged by accident when the librarian produced a pan of something that had once been cake and now had ambitions to be history, and Renaud arrived with a bottle of apple juice that he insisted was festive and which tasted like an orchard with anxieties. They ate and called it a committee meeting and laughed the way people laugh when they have believed a thing and been rewarded enough to make superstition reasonable. Renaud wore a new tie with tiny bicycles that made him look as if he had joined an eccentric government, and he had begun to help with the lab in a way that made her proud of him, not because he was competent, which he had always been in front of adults, but because his counting had adopted mercy as one of its digits. Anne sent a message to both of them saying she had been offered a role that required her to sing in a dress the color of suspicion and that she had accepted not for the dress but for a scene in which she would be permitted to make a gentleman cry, and he wrote back with seven hearts and a lemon, and after a pause she sent him a photograph of the stage lights like coins thrown in a fountain, and the three of them sat in different rooms being properly fond of one another without requiring proof.\n\nIn the city, weather found an excuse to flex, and a snow decided to matter. It arrived not with scouts but with infantry, fat flakes marching with pomp into the peripheries of plans, and by dark the streets had that purposeful hush that suggests conspiracies of good behavior. The electricity considered its options and chose, for a few hours, to be absent in several neighborhoods, and the corridor in her building filled with candlelight that made everyone look like apparitions summoned by the love lives of furniture. The elevator, which had never been reliable enough to become loved, surrendered with a sigh and trapped a young man on his way to a second date, and the neighbor\u2019s boy, solemn with role, went and fetched Madame Hanriot, who had a key that was not universal but had learned to pretend. People spoke in the tone reserved for recipes and disasters; someone discovered that the stairwell had excellent acoustics, and someone else, without permission but with tact, began to hum a tune that aspired to be a lullaby. The old woman with the fuchsia backpack arrived with a thermos of something medicinal and hopeful, and before anyone could stop them \u00c9lise and the boy were showing an impromptu line of neighbors how to walk silently down a flight in the dark without fearing their ankles. There, in the stairwell that had spent years being merely a place to not linger, a small dance formed\u2014a soft exchange of weight and trust, a mother entrusting a toddler to the banister and being rewarded, a teenager allowed to lead a grandfather without irony. When the lights returned with their blare and apology, no one cheered; they simply looked at each other with that embarrassed gratitude that follows unjustified kindness, and the young man went to his second date smelling faintly of wax and pancakes and having learned that an elevator can be an origin story.\n\nA letter with an eagle printed in blue arrived from the municipal cultural office with the good arrogance of paper that has been handled by many desks, and it informed her, with blameless formulations, that the grant money would be released in two parts, one now and one after counts had been counted, and that she was to spend some of it on something the letter called documentation. She bought a notebook the size of a sandwich and a camera that had been loved by someone else and approved of recording people who had not asked for it. She wrote down the names of songs they did not use and the moments children laughed because someone had tripped on a silence, and she took pictures of shoes lined up like sheep at the edge of a hill and of the corner of the studio where dust performed its quiet occupation. She kept the receipts because the future loves paper, and one afternoon she allowed herself to buy a secondhand coat lined with a fake fur that felt like the kindness of strangers, and she wore it to the market like a person who has admitted winter is not a rumor and has decided to look it in the eye.\n\nToulouse sent him home for a weekend the way long distances sometimes grant parole for good behavior. He arrived with the damp of a different city on his cuffs and a sleep in his eyes that belonged to trains, and in the studio he stood for a minute as if asking the room to remember him. They did not attempt the reckless parts immediately; they walked like people sanely grateful for two legs, then counted without counting because their mouths had missed the numbers, and then marked the turn with that near-religious caution dancers employ around pivots, as if the earth\u2019s patience were not infinite after all. He smelled of metal and sandwiches; she smelled of chalk and ink; they smelled, together, of a place that can be returned to without apology. After an hour, as if obeying a calendar neither had consulted, they put the music on and did the thing their bodies have been instructed to do by months of instruction, and it was messy like happiness and accurate like habit, and when it ended he was laughing and she was not, and then she laughed because the alternative would have involved something too big for an ordinary afternoon.\n\nHe had a new habit of putting his hand on the rail as they walked down the studio steps, as if his wrists were still tender and gravity had become opinionated. She noticed and did not mention it; he noticed that she noticed and did not tell his hands to behave. Over a beer that pretended to be bread, they spoke about the job and the offer of its extension and how a city is always willing to keep you if you prove yourself willing to be lonely there. He asked about the lab and she told him a story about Farid and socks that was not interesting on paper and made him put his head down on his arm and breathe as if rescued. They did not discuss what they were to one another because the table was too small for that kind of furniture and because, more importantly, they had not been able to dance for weeks and no sentence could be trusted not to sabotage that fact. When she walked him back to the train, he carried the suitcase between them with one hand and let the other brush her shoulder high, a touch that had no right to be as serious as it felt. He promised to send a photograph of the first plane trees when they grew foolish at the canal, and she promised to send the sound of her radiator when it began again its spring cluck, and neither commented on how slowly a platform releases a body once a train has left.\n\nThe showcase videos did their rounds and landed, like resigned pigeons, on a page that the students found with the ruthless efficiency of youth. One by one they presented her with her own face between classes like a bouquet with thorns; she accepted it each time with the grin of a woman who has been caught out performing devotion in the open, and fought the urge to apologize for earnestness in a thin sweater. A parent stopped her in the street to say her daughter had begun to walk at home with a small dignity that did not match the family\u2019s furniture, and \u00c9lise nodded and pretended to have this effect all the time. Another parent, this one the kind who makes enemies of ideas before meeting them, sent a message demanding to know exactly how stillness could possibly prepare a child for life, and she responded gently that standing with accuracy is the foundation of almost every useful rebellion she had ever seen, and then she closed her phone and went to the studio and practiced not thinking about proof.\n\nJules sent a photograph of the girls attacking a snowman with political grievances, and beneath it a sentence saying that he had been offered more hours at the bureau in exchange for his weekends, which he did not want to give up because those were the days when he believed in parks and small museums and the act of showing little people how to make soup. She wrote back that money is a liar and that there are values other than rent, then appended, because she is not an idiot, a recipe for a soup that uses potatoes and pride in equal measure and costs less than missing a Saturday. He called that night and they argued the way people argue when money has placed a hand on their shoulders without asking, efficient and unkind and then repentant, and they ended with the sibling truce of insulting each other\u2019s competence and the promise of tea. After, she stood in the kitchen with the coat folded over a chair like a patient animal and stared at the lemons, which had taken on for the moment the look of witnesses.\n\nAt the end of the month, the cultural center staged an end-of-winter gathering of all the strange classes it housed\u2014pottery and pies and Portuguese, a choir with more ambition than pitch, a knitting circle whose members could have intimidated armies. They took to the hall with their shy ferocities, and in a pause between a gavotte and a speech that bullied the word community into doing too much work, she led her adults in a short walk across a floor that had been polished by earnestness. The protest-haired girl did not protest; the retired dancer\u2019s knee performed with the weightless vanity of an old star; the man who had been ordered to reconnect held out his hands with the self-forgiveness of someone at last prepared to drop a weapon. A boy from the pottery class clapped with alarming sincerity, and someone yelled bravo with enough accent to make it a gift. Afterwards, in the crush of people behaving responsibly toward pastries, a woman with a face like a solved mystery told \u00c9lise she had been watching from the door because she was not ready to belong to anything yet, and that watching had made her ribcage less a cage and more an instrument. The phrase was a clich\u00e9 and a miracle. They stood there for a minute breathing like new friends until a tray demanded attention, and then they allowed real life back in.\n\nMarch opened the window by half an inch and dared everyone to be optimistic. The rain changed its handwriting; the butcher\u2019s fennel gave up medicine and returned to mischief; the river decided to resume gossip. She woke one morning to a light that had made its mind up about the future and a message from Toulouse that contained only a photograph of a plane tree doing its obscene green, and she laughed aloud because vulgarity can be moral in moderate quantities. The headmaster sent word that the committee had granted the lab enough money to last through spring provided she supplied testimonials, and she spent an evening calling parents to ask for sentences that did not sound like they had been composed beneath a threatening lamp. The answers came like gifts left on doorsteps\u2014my son is gentler with doors now, my daughter corrected her grandfather\u2019s posture in the queue for croissants, my child breathes as if her own body is a place and not an enemy\u2014and she wrote them down without polishing, because the truth does not need cologne.\n\nOn a Thursday that smelled of new mud, the old woman with the fuchsia backpack invited her to a dance she described as respectable only from a distance. It was one of those Sunday afternoons in a gymnasium hired by people who believe they can charm a linoleum floor, and they could, mostly, because they had learned to bring their own light under their cardigans. The music was both too loud and not loud enough; the men shook hands with their nerves while the women held their chins with the practiced ease of queens of small countries; there was a raffle featuring a ham. \u00c9lise danced with three strangers who were all portions of a man she might once have thought she wanted\u2014gentle, clumsy, certain\u2014and with one woman who offered to lead and did so with an elegance that made her bones applaud. Between numbers she stood with the old woman and watched the couples go by and learned a taxonomy of joy that had nothing to do with youth and everything to do with permission. On their way out, they crossed the car park between puddles that had memorized the boots of the city, and the old woman said that of all the immodest things human beings insist on doing, learning with the body in public is the one she respects most, and \u00c9lise tucked the sentence under her tongue for later like a sugar.\n\nThe studio, when not borrowed by revolving classes, belonged to her in a way that felt almost liturgical. Alone now in the afternoons that could be spared, she arranged the chairs along the wall as if seating donors at a banquet, set the metronome to a compromise, and walked the phrase that had eluded her for a year with the tender patience of someone coaxing a cat from beneath a bed. Without him there to correct and be corrected, she discovered corners she had not known the room possessed. There is a laurel one can rest under that grows even in the absence of victory\u2014you have come back, it says, which is the point\u2014and she accepted its shade without writing a speech about it. Once, in the middle of a turn that had always required an apology, she felt the star press insistently against her sternum right at the moment when her foot would choose, and the choice was sudden and obvious and exactly correct; she laughed alone in the room and bowed to nobody for having decided to remain alive and to perform that aliveness in an unfashionable, inefficient, undignified way.\n\nIn the late afternoons after the lab, the courtyard filled with the kind of arguments that restore faith in the populace\u2014four children disagreeing about the ethics of cutting in line for the water fountain with the vocabulary of a parliament and the volume control of seagulls. She walked home slower because there is a kind of gratitude that demands dawdling, and on the bridge she encountered the headmaster practicing his own dawdle, hands behind his back in the posture of a man examining policy through the lens of birds. He thanked her, with more economy than usual, for the sentences parents had sent, and confessed, as if to a crime, that he had tried standing still for one minute the night before between the refrigerator and the sink and had found the activity shocking. She told him he could start a movement, and he said he had started a movement when he chose a life that contained detention slips, and they laughed with the rare ease of colleagues who have, for an afternoon, misplaced their weariness.\n\nRafa\u00ebl returned for good on a day that pretended not to be triumphant. He came with two bags and an extra line near his left eye that had not been there before and made him look more like himself. The city received him with a shrug that functioned as welcome; the studio, with its indifferent floor and its faithful mirrors, offered him no discount, which was also a form of love. They practiced the piece and then did not, abandoning it for the foolishness of a rhythm neither would ever perform in public because it required too much forgetting. In the pause between tracks, he said there was an offer to go back in summer to a site that promised to pay and to break and asked, in a tone that the bell in her recognized as fear disguised as courtesy, whether she thought he should. She answered with the cruelty of honesty that she did not intend to be cruel, telling him she wanted him here and that she would applaud him if he left, and that for the first time in her entire life she was able to imagine asking someone to stay without confusing the request with a threat, and he listened with the stillness of a man standing under weather and deciding whether it is rain or baptism. They did not solve it; they danced again instead, which is not a solution but is a system, and it kept them from saying the ugly sentences later disguised as noble.\n\nOn the way home that night, the tram made an unplanned halt between stations where the city is all weeds and confessions, and for five minutes a car of strangers did the revolution of accepting each other. A woman removed a paper star from her coat and handed it to a child who had been patient; a man looked up from his phone with the expression of someone realizing his own face is not so bad; two teenagers performed the small tender cruelty of pretending not to be in love. She stood holding the pole and felt the weird mercy of a pause you did not request and could not lengthen, and when the tram started again the city returned to its ungenerous grace and she tagged along as if invited.\n\nAt home, the crooked star lay cooling against her sternum and the gladiators kept their watch over the plant that refused to be a tree but insisted upon hope. She set the new notebook on the table with its pages that looked like certainty and wrote down nothing for a while, letting the pen rest its weight on the paper the way a foot finds the floor and waits for it to respond. The bell at her sternum sounded low and friendly, an old clock that would, she suspected, continue to ring even if the city went briefly mad with spring and then with disappointment. She opened the window, listened to the water dumpsters gossip in the alley, and put on a record that made the kitchen behave like a considerate partner. It was not a victory night or a debt night; it was simply a continuing, and she stood in it the way one stands in a shower that takes a moment to decide who it belongs to and then, benevolently, concedes.",

The air at that hour was damp enough to gather into her hair, a halo of soft frizz that her mothers would once have tut-tutted about. Her mother was dead now, but \u00c9lise still heard her sometimes\u2014This is not how a teacher presents herself\u2014like an old radio left playing somewhere behind there in childhood.\n\nShe tugged her scarf tighter and remembered that she had promised Camille she would look over the new poem, even though the girl would not need it; there was something in Camille that had begun to do its own work, a steady learning like a quiet motor. They were like that at thirteen, sometimes, full of buds that would not open for two or three years and then suddenly, one spring morning, a person. In the staff room, Renaud had already burned the coffee and was pretending, with a kind of brittle enthusiasm, that it had been on purpose to keep them awake.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too early,\u201d he said when she came in. \u201cIt\u2019s unhealthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can split the unhealthiness then,\u201d she said, hanging her coat on the back of a chair and pulling from her bag a plastic container of tiny tangerines, pocked and sweet. \u201cI brought clementines.\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought the smell of burnt.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, a feast,\u201d she said.\n\nThere were chalk dust crumbs on the table and somebody\u2019s forgotten glove. The radiator clicked. It was the first Tuesday after the vacation and everyone had that look, a faint pallor that in six weeks would become fury. Renaud passed her a cup and she took a breath and drank. It was as awful as promised, but it made her heart flicker.\n\nShe taught them Pr\u00e9vert, that morning, and she had them read the lines out loud with their neat mouths because poetry should move through the body, because she had learned to love rhythm before she learned to love meaning. That was not a thing one could tell children without sounding like you were selling them a scented candle. She told them anyway. \u201cSay it like you are not afraid of your own voice,\u201d she said, and Camille raised her head and read, and the boy in the front row whose name always escaped her snapped his gum and tried to hide it in his sleeve, and outside, a truck scratched its way along the street and then was gone.\n\nIt was after lunch, after she had eaten a hard-boiled egg and a heel of bread at her desk, that the message arrived. It came by way of her phone lying among the corrected papers like a lost fish. It came like this: a number she did not recognize, then a voice, caught a moment by the school\u2019s poor reception, and then a name. \u201cMadame Martin? It\u2019s Giraud. From Les \u00c9toiles de la Cit\u00e9.\u201d She had to say pardon twice, and carried the phone into the hall where the tiles helped the signal find its courage.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d she said, and her voice felt too thin.\n\n\u201cYou entered the regionals last month with\u2014\u201d the woman paused, a rustle of paper, \u201c\u2014with a partner, Monsieur Costa? Rafa\u00ebl Costa? I wanted to inform you that due to a disqualification, you are now qualified for the final round. It will be in Paris, the twelfth, at the Carr\u00e9. We\u2019d be delighted to have you. We sent an email yesterday but perhaps it went astray.\u201d\n\nIt had gone astray. All her emails went astray because she did not care for them. She considered them like flies at a picnic, a necessary toleration. She made a sound. It was not quite language.\n\n\u201cMadame Martin?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said again. She had to sit down on the bench under the grim class photos where dozens of children had tried to make their faces into acceptable offerings to the future. \u201cYes. That is\u2014merci.\u201d She could hear her breath. She thought of Rafa\u00ebl\u2019s shoulders and the way his jaw clenched when he laughed. She thought of the tiny trophy they had not won the last time, how she had brushed the dust from its base with a fingertip while they waited for their number to be called. \u201cIt will be\u2014next week?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe twelfth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the train\u2014\" She stopped herself. \u201cNo. Thank you. Yes. We will be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease confirm by email,\u201d said Madame Giraud. \u201cThere\u2019s a small fee to secure the slot, but nothing significant, and you can pay upon arrival. We are, truly, quite delighted. You were radiant. Your bol\u00e9ro\u2014\u201d A tut of pleasure down the line. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive my frankness, it made me cry.\u201d\n\nThe line went dead and \u00c9lise sat there with the phone in both hands and stared at her reflection in it. She looked gray; she always looked gray in the school, as if the walls rubbed their chalk onto her. The twelfth. In Paris. She breathed the words into the hollow of her scarf. A laugh rose in her throat and she smothered it. She could not bear for laughter to escape into a place like this, where it would be eaten by days.\n\n\u201cEverything all right?\u201d said Renaud, who had come to the door with a stack of worksheets and that look of a man carrying a birthday cake that he himself did not want.\n\n\u201cEverything is very well,\u201d she said. \u201cBetter than well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that allowed?\u201d\n\nShe rose, and touched his sleeve impulsively. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later. Imagine, we are quartz. We are shining.\u201d\n\nHe looked at his worksheets as if they might hold an answer. \u201cYou are peculiar, Martin. But it\u2019s good to see you be\u2014what is that word? \u00c9clair\u00e9e.\u201d\n\nShe spent the rest of the afternoon like a woman who had put down something heavy and was trying not to remember it. In 5B, when a boy called Yannis made a joke about Moli\u00e8re that turned his mouth into a little blade, she laughed and took the joke and twisted it into a lesson about farce, and the boy flushed in triumph. On the stairs a parent stopped her to ask about extra practice for exams, and she said yes to everything, and she understood nothing of what she was promising but felt she would pay it all later out of a deep reservoir of grace. The children went home into a rain that had begun precisely at four; the courtyard filled with umbrellas and yelling, and then reduced itself to a few late walkers and the sound of a ball failing to be caught.\n\nShe sent a message to Rafa\u00ebl. It said only: Can we talk? 7 at the studio? It added, in the end, because she could not help herself: Paris.\n\nHis reply came with unreasonable slowness. He worked long hours wherever it was he worked, down in some belly of a building where wires were snakes and insulation was snow. He often had blisters. He often had a look that made her want to press her fingertips to his wrists. It arrived just as she reached her apartment: Affirmative, star. 7. And a small blue star. He had a way with emojis that made them seem like pebbles he had picked up from a beach.\n\nIn her apartment the heat was a stubborn old dog that only came when it was called five, six times. She turned it on and waited. The wall by the door had a stain that looked like Corsica. She kicked off her shoes and put on the kettle and stood in the small kitchen where a single glass was drying on a towel and a bowl of lemons stubbornly refused to sweeten the air. She was not poor, not exactly, and yet she held her breath when she checked the bank app on her phone, the way a swimmer holds a breath before looking through green water for the bottom.\n\nThe numbers were what the numbers always were, a little obtuse. Enough to live. Not enough to play, not without counting. She had been telling herself this for so long it had become a lullaby. She closed the app. She drank her tea standing up. She looked at herself in the mirror that hung above the sink and saw that she was thirty-six, that is, almost forty, that is, not young and not the end of anything, that is, a person who might yet do a thing she cared about. She stuck her tongue out at herself and then laughed and went to find her dance bag.\n\nShe paused at the postcard pinned above her desk, the one of the Palais Garnier at night, and touched the edge of it with her nail. This was what she wanted: to slide into a dress that smelled of oranges and metal and to walk out onto a stage and discover that the floor had the same kind of spring as a kiss. She had started too late, as everyone told you you were not supposed to do, and she knew with an almost sweet clarity that she would never be a professional, never earn anything from this, and that because of that she had to return to it again and again, like a cat to a door it did not believe was closed.\n\nShe put on her coat and went back out, down the stair with its greased wooden banister, across to the street where the night had spread itself like ink. The studio was three tram stops away, down past the bakery that made a baguette with olives that tasted like holidays. Inside the studio the air was warm and sharp with human ambition. There were three couples in a corner working out the mechanics of a turn and a boy with earbuds doing acrobatics in the mirror. The long wall of glass reflected everyone twice, three times, into different versions of themselves.\n\n\u201cStar,\u201d said Rafa\u00ebl, from the bleachers. He wore an old sweater with holes and a grin that lived mostly in his mouth. He did not stand up, but opened his arms and she went into them, because that was their arrangement, an arrangement that had its rules. They were more than friends and less than lovers and exactly partners. They held on longer than was necessary and then let go.\n\n\u201cSay it,\u201d he said. \u201cSay it out loud, so we know if it\u2019s real.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the final round,\u201d she said. \u201cParis. The twelfth. The Carr\u00e9.\u201d\n\nHe let out a shout that made heads turn. Then he kissed the air near her cheek and did a sort of foolish dance that looked like a dance of a man mocked by happiness and grateful for it. \u201cI told you,\u201d he said. \u201cI told you they weren\u2019t blind.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me we were good enough to frighten small dogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I was translating. There is only so much my French can do.\u201d\n\nHis French was fine; he had been here since he was nine. She loved to mock him for his agreeable vowels, the way a Portuguese made everything sound a little tender. He grabbed her bag and carried it as if it weighed nothing. \u201cThe twelfth,\u201d he said, and the word seemed to take up space in his mouth. \u201cWe will kill them.\u201d\n\nShe held his arm. The word kill made her think of knives and judges and the way her heart had stopped in the regionals just before their music began. \u201cWe will not die,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will dance.\u201d\n\nFor an hour they worked, not because it mattered anymore, but because it always mattered. They whooped, they bickered, they counted: five, six, seven, eight. Her feet were fine; it was her head that failed. Sometimes she stood there, looking, and could not move forward into the next thing. He knew that place in her. He stood off the line of her body until she could feel him like a town behind her shoulder, and then she moved. They spoke little. The music did the part that words always do wrong.\n\nWhen they paused, he looked at her. \u201cDo you have\u2014\u201d he had an expression he wore when he was about to say something she would not like, \u201c\u2014you have the train covered?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, quickly.\n\n\u201cBecause I can advance you,\u201d he said, looking away at the mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. They are paying me early for the job near Oullins. The one with the leak.\u201d\n\nShe wiped sweat from her forehead with the collar of her shirt. She had a blue bruise inside her right thigh where their knees had kissed too hard in a dip. She thought of her bank app like a small, square window that opened onto a cliff. \u201cI am not an orphan,\u201d she said. She smiled. The joke was a bit poor. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. He did not believe her. He would bring it up again, because he loved her in the way one loves a dance partner or a lost cousin; he would pretend not to, because he loved her in the second way too, perhaps, and the pretending was tenderer than anything more violent. \u201cWe have to find a dress.\u201d\n\nShe had one, of course, but it had lost some of its power with the season. It had been red once, and now it was that color of a tomato that has had its finest days. She pictured herself in the bright square of the Paris stage, a smudge. She swallowed. \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always manage,\u201d he said, and he meant it as praise, but she heard the other thing in it, the piety of surviving.\n\nThey changed the music and went again. He put his hand at the small of her back and they slipped like two pieces of a machine into the turn that had broken them in the regional. This time the floor would not accept her heel; it slid, and she stumbled and caught herself on his shoulder with a little sound that was not exactly pain and not exactly fear. He laughed once, under his breath. \u201cAgain,\u201d he said.\n\nLater, when the studio had emptied and the boy with the earbuds had gone to wherever boys with earbuds go, they sat on the bleachers and drank from a bottle of water and let their bodies think things over. The window was a plain square of night.\n\n\u201cDo you ever think of stopping?\u201d he asked suddenly, as if the question had been waiting for the right breath to sit on. \u201cIf we win\u2014if we lose\u2014do you ever think of just not having the need any more?\u201d\n\nShe watched the mirror\u2019s empty face. She thought of her mother standing in the doorway of the kitchen with one hand pressed into the small of her back and a beautiful hatred of illness on her mouth. \u201cSometimes I think of stopping,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I think I can\u2019t stop. And sometimes I imagine doing just one thing well and then forgetting it forever. Like being nineteen and kissing someone who will not matter and doing it so completely that you have nothing left, so you cannot ever ask for that from anyone again.\u201d\n\nHe laughed softly. \u201cIt is good we are not nineteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d\n\nOn the tram home the world looked like photographs taken through the bottom of a lake. Her hands smelled of that studio smell, a mix of pine cleaner and breath. She put her head back and closed her eyes and let the word Paris roll through her. She could see the train in her mind, the stupid mouth of it opening, the stupid red seats, the track repeating itself under them, this ordinary miracle of locomotion. She remembered the competition\u2019s lights, how they flicker before they settle, that way the blown dust at the top of an auditorium catches the light so that one imagines falling gold. She imagined applause, but it was always the hush she wanted\u2014the way sound gets thicker when a room waits.\n\nHer phone buzzed. It was Camille. The message was shy. Madame, if you have time tomorrow, will you look at the poem? I added a part. My mother says it is too much but what can you do.\n\nShe wrote back: Yes. Bring your mother\u2019s too-much part. I like too much.\n\nThen, for no good reason, she counted her wallet\u2019s contents on her knees\u2014this childish thing, the way one counts pebbles\u2014twenty, ten, ten, a single two-euro, some coins that had no right to exist. She put them back and felt suddenly as if she were wearing a coat that had been made for someone else. She almost messaged Rafa\u00ebl. She did not.\n\nAt home she made a soup out of the carrots and a sad onion and ate it standing up again, with a little crude pepper so she could pretend it was fierce. She found the email from Les \u00c9toiles, sitting in the junk folder among offers to enlarge things she did not have. It was as Madame Giraud had said. There was a small fee and a form that asked for sizes and for a song and for an emergency contact. She put down no one for that last, and then she did put someone: Jules, her brother, whom she had not spoken to in three months and who had sent her a text that said simply, I can\u2019t continue to watch you do this to yourself. He was a kind man in a way that made him impossible. She put his number and hoped nothing would happen that required kindness.\n\nIt was when she reached the section about travel and accommodations that she paused too long. She did not have to book a hotel\u2014they offered a cheap one\u2014but she would need to secure her ticket to Paris. There were trains every hour, almost, and they were not expensive, not in the way that a dress was expensive or the cost of a mother\u2019s medicine was expensive. And yet she felt as if the numbers might do that thing numbers sometimes did: cease to belong to her.\n\nShe closed the computer and went to fill the bath. The apartment\u2019s pipes were old enough to remember better times. The water came a little brown at first and then it cleared, as if it had made up its mind. She undressed with a briskness she used for many things. She looked down at her stomach as she stepped in and thought, unkindly, almost automatically, of the girls at the studio with their knees like fresh breadsticks, and then she pushed the thought away and sank until the water came up to her ears, where everything sounds faithful.\n\nShe dreamed that night, as she often did after dancing, and the dream was of a hall with floors that refused every foot but hers. She was alone in the center and the chairs were filled with women with her mother\u2019s hair who watched her with faces that could have been either love or contempt. She woke before the applause, with tears that seemed to have been put there by someone else.\n\nThe next day began with a clatter\u2014the neighbor\u2019s young man dropping his bicycle on the landing and swearing in a whisper\u2014and came back to its normal rhythm, as days do. At school the photocopier refused one of her requests, then accepted another with a grudge. The teacher who taught maths wore a tie he had definitely bought to be a joke that had matured into a tragedy. After third period, the headmaster called a short meeting to say that there would be cuts to the field trips this year and that any excursions must be justified with something more than \u201cenrichment.\u201d There was a murmur that was not exactly agreement and not exactly rage; the teachers swam in it like fish in a small bowl.\n\nShe told Renaud at break. The coffee was less burnt but somehow more offensive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the final,\u201d she said, trying to say it as if it were a thing that could be spoken in a staff room. \u201cParis. We go next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014?\u201d For a moment he stood very straight, like someone a conductor has asked to make a noise. \u201cBrava.\u201d He said it the Italian way because last year he had fallen in love with an opera singer and entirely used up the word bravo. \u201cWhat does that entail?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe dance. People watch. There is a trophy with small gladiators on it. Very serious business.\u201d\n\nHe lifted his cup in a toast. \u201cBring a gladiator to the staff room.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will go very well with the burnt coffee.\u201d\n\nIn the afternoon Camille came with the poem and her flushed cheeks. She sat at the edge of the desk with a kind of hunger. \u00c9lise read the poem quickly first, then again slowly. It was not bad. It had one perfect line\u2014my father walks around the house like a jacket that has forgotten the body\u2014and a great many lines that were in love with their own handwriting. They talked about killing darlings without naming it that. They talked about leaving air in the poem for someone else to come in and sit down. Camille nodded like this had been what she\u2019d been trying to do all week and now could not wait to do properly. \u201cYou are too much,\u201d she said as she gathered her paper. \u201cBut I think I like too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother will have to live,\u201d said \u00c9lise.\n\nAfter school she caught the tram two stops too far, distracted by an old man asleep with his mouth open, by a poster that said something to her and then said it again differently. She walked back along the river, which today was green like an inexplicable cup, and through the market where men called apple names to her and women stacked tomatoes like rubies. She wanted everything. She bought two pears and an orange as if they were ideas. At home she weighed the bank app like a word on her tongue that she did not want to pronounce. She waited. There was no sudden influx of money from a benevolent aunt. There was the same ordinary handful of days between now and pay day and the same ledger of bills that had been waiting for her since she became her own person.\n\nShe made a list. It said: rent. electricity. telephone. metro. food. then, in small letters, dance. She stuck it on the fridge and then laughed because of course it had nothing to do with a list. She would go to Paris even if she had to walk. She would go to Paris even if she had to sit in the aisle and pretend she was a bag.\n\nThen she thought of asking Jules. She thought of calling and hearing his voice, the one he had learned to make like a spoon\u2014warm, offering. She thought of refusing the spoon because it would mean something she would hate. She put the phone back down without picking it up.\n\nAt the studio that evening, they worked with a quiet fervor that people who do not know dance might call obsession and people who do know dance might call habitation. She had eaten the orange beforehand and her tongue was sweet. They chose their music. Something Cuban that had a brass that rose like a hand. They argued about the last thirty seconds.\n\n\u201cIt should be risk,\u201d said Rafa\u00ebl, touching his chest where the music entered. \u201cIf it is not risk, it is not art. It is accountancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like accountancy,\u201d she said, smiling, but she did not like it; she liked risk and hated losing.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are not here to be careful.\u201d\n\nThey arranged the last thirty seconds to break them and then brought it back a little so they might live. It was not perfect. Nothing was. \u201cI will have to get a dress,\u201d she said, again, like a woman who says I will have to get a second job, like a woman who says I will have to learn to forgive.\n\n\u201cI can keep the boys at the site late,\u201d said Rafa\u00ebl. \u201cMake them work two more days if necessary. Then I will give you the money and you will be obliged to accept, because you have already accepted my hand and my lead and therefore you accept everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk like a man whose mother loved him too well,\u201d she said, and he laughed at that, a catch in the laugh that was not exactly pain.\n\nAfter, in the cool corridor, an old woman with a bun and a fuchsia backpack stopped \u00c9lise with a hand on her elbow. \u201cMademoiselle?\u201d she said, as if the word had failed and fallen back to the ground of another era. \u201cI saw you. You are\u2014please forgive me\u2014beautiful when you dance. The rest of the time you are ordinary, like the rest of us. But there\u2014\u201d she placed her hand very delicately at \u00c9lise\u2019s sternum, \u201c\u2014there you are like a bell.\u201d\n\nElise smiled. \u201cMerci.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to Paris,\u201d said the woman, as if she knew everything about it. \u201cDo not let anyone stop you.\u201d\n\nAt home, a message waited from her landlord that said simply: Reminder. The rent must be paid by the tenth. It had a smiley face, which felt like a threat. She sat down on the couch that had belonged to her mother and stared at the place where a thread had withstood a thousand sit-downs. She could hear the upstairs couple arguing again, but softly, the way people argue after they have made a vow not to.\n\nShe took the envelope out from under the shelf where she kept envelopes. It contained eighty euros in cash, a number she had been carefully not counting since last month. She put it on the table and laid the coins from her wallet beside it. It was not nothing. It was not enough. She counted them anyway, piling them like stones.\n\nShe thought, with a sudden terrible sweetness, about stealing the money. Not from a person, never from a person; she could not bear taking the softness out of someone else\u2019s day. But from a system that would not notice. She thought of the school\u2019s petty cash box, which you had to sign for, and the way it had not been counted lately because Madame Aujoulat\u2019s father had been ill. She felt the thought and then she threw it from her, a small bird. It went to the window and tapped there and then went away.\n\nShe wrote a message to Jules and then did not send it. It said: This is childish. It said: You are right: I am doing this to myself. It said: If I do not do this, I do not know what I am for.\n\nShe went to bed. She dreamed again\u2014the hall now had a ceiling of glass and rain fell on it like beads on a drum\u2014she went through the turn that had always been a small cruelty and came out of it as if she had not been hurt in any of this. When she woke, she had the taste of pears in her mouth and could not say why.\n\nOn Thursday she took her class to the library and watched them be briefly quiet, which was a miracle she did not even require faith for, because the library had done its work for longer than any of them had been alive. She caught a glimpse, in the glass of a bookcase, of a woman who was not herself, or rather was herself if she had been the person she had thought she would be at twenty. It made her laugh at nothing and made her sad in that way that is not tragedy but is its little cousin.\n\nAt lunch she finally called Giraud to confirm, and the woman\u2019s voice was brisk with the delight of someone whose job was to put ribbons around people\u2019s desire. \u201cWe look forward to seeing you,\u201d she said. \u201cTruly. Bring your music on a USB stick. Bring your papers. Bring your luck.\u201d\n\nShe went then to the ticket site and found the trains. She chose a time that would place them in the capital three hours before they needed to be anywhere and ticked a box for a seat by a window as if this would change the course of her life. When she reached the place where you put your card numbers in, she felt her heart step into some older rhythm. It was like being a child again, balancing on a wall and looking down at gravel. She typed them. The site thought. The site thought longer.\n\nShe had ninety-three euros left until the tenth. The tickets would be seventy-six each if they were not purchased with hope but with reality. She did not have one seventy-six. She had one ninety-three. She cancelled. She closed the computer. She went to the sink and washed a glass that was already clean.\n\nShe would borrow from Rafa\u00ebl. It would be a joke between them that stung less because of their jokes. She would borrow and then pay him back with money earned from invigilation and two weeks of not buying pears. She could do it. The thought sat on her shoulder. It was not a good bird and not a bad bird; it was just a bird.\n\nThe day went on. She taught, she smiled at Renaud when he tried to sing a line from Pr\u00e9vert and came out with something like \u00c9dith Piaf being sad in a hallway. She went to the market and touched the lemons and did not buy them. She returned home and took the envelope out again and counted again and the numbers became tender in their inadequacy, like a man one knows will never love you, no matter how one speaks.\n\nIn the evening she went to the studio and found Rafa\u00ebl not yet there. She stretched, gently, as she was supposed to do, and then less gently, as she always ended up doing, because patience was not the same as virtue. A young couple practiced something furious, all elbows, and the radio tried to sell them a milk. She looked down at her shoes, these faithful leather things, and thought of Paris like a place in a book she had loved at thirteen and not had the money to buy.\n\nWhen Rafa\u00ebl arrived, he smelled of dust and rain and he kissed her cheek quickly, twice, three times as if he had missed and needed to correct. \u201cWe will practice the last second until our feet beg us to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cBut first\u2014\u201d\n\nHe pressed a small envelope into her hand. He had written her name on it in a schoolboy hand, the f choking the i. \u201cBefore you start to protest,\u201d he said, raising his palms, \u201cit is not charity. It is an investment. It is an investment in my own glory, because I have no chance without you, and that makes this transaction very pure. It is more pure than love. It\u2019s geometry.\u201d\n\nShe worked the flap of the envelope back and forth and then put it back in her bag unopened. \u201cIf it is geometry,\u201d she said, \u201cthen you can calculate the angle of my gratitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour gratitude is obtuse,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cIt takes up the whole circle. And it has sharp corners.\u201d\n\nShe did not protest. She would protest later. They danced until the muscles behind her knees trembled like mice. When they finished, the studio\u2019s cleaning woman was waiting, arms folded, to chase them out. In the street, the damp had a hunger. He walked her to the tram stop and then, impulsively, as the tram arrived, pressed his palm once to her cheek. \u201cWe will do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be a story they tell to their children who will not care.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIt will make us furious.\u201d\n\nOn the tram, she touched the place where his hand had been and thought of all the hands that had ever touched her and how they seemed now like a series of emulsions, layers, like the way garlic comes in its small papers. She took out the envelope and opened it and counted quickly: fifty, a hundred, two, two-twenty. It was too much and then not enough and then absolutely right. She felt that stew of shame and relief that sits inside acts of kindness. She sighed. She wanted to tell someone and there was no one to tell who would not make of it a diagnosis.\n\nAt home she booked the tickets. The site hummed itself into action and then spat them into her email like small birds she would have to keep warm. She stood there a long time, watching the spinner, and then felt a happiness so ridiculous, so unshaped, that she had to say something aloud to give it walls. \u201cParis,\u201d she said, to the empty room. \u201cParis, Paris.\u201d\n\nThat night she could not sleep. She lay there and watched the ceiling insist upon itself, that very particular French ceiling with its thin cracks like maps of lost territories. She tried to orchestrate her thoughts: train time, warm up schedule, food, water, sleep, the dress, a contingency plan for the moment her mind might refuse her, as it did sometimes because it was old habit to refuse itself what it wanted most. She imagined writing to Jules and saying I am in the final can you believe and the message coming back with his big-hands words. She turned over and smelled the winter coming in through the window.\n\nIn the morning, a sound like the end of distant construction woke her. She went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, thought about breakfast, decided to be a person who ate yogurt. She wrote an email to Camille about the poem and included an attachment of something by Szymborska that she loved like a secret. She put on the newish sweater she had bought in a moment of optimism in September, and a necklace she did not wear often, because she wanted the day to be heavy around her neck in a good way.\n\nIn the stairwell, the neighbor\u2019s boy was sitting on the step with his bike upside down, working the chain with black fingers. \u201c\u00c7a va?\u201d she said, because that is what you say.\n\n\u201c\u00c7a tient,\u201d he said without looking up, which is the truth of many things.\n\nOn the way to school she passed the big poster of the dance finals that someone had pasted to the wall near the tram. She wasn\u2019t on the poster, of course; it had a woman with a mouth like a promise and a man with arms that looked like good architecture. She stopped and looked, and then she looked away and then she looked back again, like a child not allowed to stare at something delicious. She wrote to Rafa\u00ebl: We must be ridiculous; they will throw flowers and we will break our ankles trying to pick them up. He wrote back a picture of a gladiator.\n\nAt school she was called into the headmaster\u2019s office. He was a neat man who wore his small authority like a jacket he was afraid of dirtying. \u201cMadame Martin,\u201d he said, \u201cI have a favor to ask. The exams require two invigilators this Saturday. We have no one.\u201d\n\nShe thought of the studio, of practicing with the panic of a person who had decided to believe in something. She thought too of the envelope with its bilingual coins. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat time?\u201d\n\n\u201cNine until noon,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew I could rely on you. You are dependable.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t know whether to be pleased or insulted. Dependable is not a word that gets invited to the finals of anything. She said yes again to the universe in general, and then went back to class and drew a diagram of a sentence on the board and made jokes about the way adjectives are like people who arrive late to parties and discover that everything they have to say has already been said.\n\nIn the quiet between classes, the world felt far away. She thought again of the year her mother had been ill and how thick the air had been in that apartment, sweet with syrups and despair, and how the bodies of the nurses had moved through it like ships. She thought of how she had begun then to go to the free salsa in the park, to learn not the dance exactly but the permission to stand in a place and take up space. It was a permission she had never had in the house, where her mother had been the size of everything. It was not a story she ever told now, because people got very close to your face when you told them something like that, and she was not interested in that closeness.\n\nShe stood at the window and watched a boy kiss a girl on the mouth behind the rubbish bins, and she smiled, and then she thought of the little turtle she and Jules had had when they were children, the way it had put its head out of the shell like a question mark, the way it had disappeared one day and never been found. She wrote Jules: I miss you. She did not send it. She put her phone away like a candy she had decided to save for later and then intended to hide from herself.\n\nAs the week turned, she felt the city begin to breathe faster. It was probably only her. The deadline for the rent crept its fingers through the days. She checked her account again, and used the precise part of her mind to divide the money for bread from the money for cow\u2019s milk. She imagined the train with its light like a clean forehead, and the station air, and the way Paris always smelled a little like gasoline and a little like old stone and something else, maybe frankness.\n\nWhen Friday evening came she and Rafa\u00ebl danced as if the floor itself were a person they wanted to seduce. They did not talk much. There is a point at which talk only frightens what must come. When she left the studio she kissed his cheek too and tasted salt and then the city came over her like a shawl. The tram was late. Two girls sang softly that song that everyone was singing and made it sound less like a funeral. The night was full of little red things\u2014tail lights, the last leaves, a scarf someone had dropped.\n\nAt home, the rent notice had come under the door, printed, like a calling card. She picked it up and placed it on the table, as if giving it a chair would civilize it. She took the envelope from her bag and put it alongside the notice. She took the little cash from the jar where she sometimes kept coffee coins. She made a neat stack. She did this as if she were a person in a film who knows that paper will change a life. She calculated the train tickets in her head and felt a small lurch at the bottom of the sum. She would be short. And if she paid the landlord first, she would not get to Paris. And if she paid the train, she would have to go to the landlord and make a shape with her mouth that said, Je vous promets.\n\nShe sat very still. Water in the radiators made a sound like wood remembering fire. The lights of a car moved along the ceiling.\n\nShe thought, for a moment that stretched too long, of not going. Of stepping back from the little precipice she had brought herself to and deciding that the sensible thing, the prudent thing, the grown-up thing, would be to be prudent and grown. That she could be the teacher who never left the city, the woman who lit a candle for herself and read in bed until she was eighty. She thought it and then she put it down, and the putting down was like lifting a piano with two fingers.\n\nShe took her shoes off and set them side by side. She put the notice face down; the white rectangle of it became just paper again. She poured herself a glass of water and drank half of it and put it down and then she stood, because standing sometimes changes the nature of a decision. She picked up her phone and wrote to Rafa\u00ebl: Tomorrow after invigilation, we will practice until no. She did not finish the sentence. He replied with a fist and a star.\n\nShe went to bed smiling at nothing. The radiator clucked. In the space just before sleep, she saw the inside of the train again, and heard the voice that would announce their arrival, the way those voices pretend to be human and then give up.\n\nAnd below the dream, below the moving and the making of lists and the small arithmetic of a life, there was, as always, an image that had come to her when she was a girl: a stage, a light that found her and made her edges crisp, a sound that connected the bones of her feet to the ancient, unnecessary, astonishing drum in her chest. It was foolish. It was not. It had accompanied her through worse than poverty, through grief that had taught her the name of every hour of the night. It was the door she tapped at, at midnight, and sometimes it opened and sometimes it did not, but always, always, she could see the light under it, and that was enough to keep her there, singing a little nonsense tune until someone turned the knob.",

The invigilation box sat squat on the desk in the office with its packet of extra pens and its roll of numbered labels that made every child temporarily a receipt. She signed for the key and took a breath that tasted of yesterday\u2019s photocopies, then walked to the assigned room with the deliberate pace of someone escorting themselves. The windows there had the institutional view she always loved\u2014sky, a portion of a plane tree, the top of a bus stop where someone had written a declaration of love that used up all its vowels.\n\nThey came in holding their fear the way one holds a plate of soup: two hands, high, careful. She greeted them, named the rules, repeated them, set the papers face down like towels, and then they began. Silence arrived in its particular shoes. It was not the silence of churches, nor the silence of deep winter, but that civic pause people enter when they agree, without discussing it, that they will behave as if they, together, can be trustworthy. There was the coughed apology, the scrape of a chair foot across linoleum, the steady saw of the hallway\u2019s distant cleaning machine. For a while, she forgot she wanted anything besides this\u2014a room of people trying with their whole bodies to put a thought into a small square. The hush thickened so pleasantly that she had to stop herself from smiling, in case a child mistook it for cruelty or a trap.\n\nHalfway through, the boy with the deliciously destructive jokes, Yannis, lifted his head, met her eyes with a sort of adolescent honesty, and then let his gaze slide to the left. The girl beside him stiffened in that way the body does when it knows it is about to be offered a sin. \u00c9lise raised her eyebrows and walked as if to the window, pausing so near their desk that they could smell her tea breath. She did not speak. She did not have to. The long corridor of years ahead of them would be full of rooms like this and chances to become either the person who helps or the person who pretends not to see. The boy looked down, the girl exhaled, the small moral city within the school continued to stand.\n\nWhen it was over, there was a sound like discarded armor as the children put down their pens. They filed out blinking, temporarily lighter, like people leaving a cinema. She collected the papers, shuffled them, sealed them with an official sticker that was only glue and yet, apparently, a guarantee that the world would keep its promises. In the staff room, Renaud applauded lazily with his fingers against his own palm and offered her the last brioche from a bag that had failed to keep it tender. They ate in solidarity with themselves. \u201cYou will go this afternoon and make the floor ask for mercy,\u201d he said, and she liked him for understanding that this was a thing one could want.\n\nShe changed at the studio only partially, keeping her school skirt and exchanging her blouse for a tank, and for a moment the half-costume felt like the perfect outfit for her life\u2014one foot in one world and the other insisting on rhythm. Rafa\u00ebl arrived late, hair wet with the rain he had refused to avoid, and his apology was a grin with its hat in its hand. They worked without talking about it, in the way people do who have spent a very long time learning the grammar of each other\u2019s hips. The last thirty seconds, which had been a negotiation with risk, turned into an argument with gravity. Three times they took the turn that held in it the possibility of farce or flight, and three times she felt her heel kiss the floor exactly once like a polite guest. He did not let go of her hand even when they were safe. \u201cYou see,\u201d he said, later, warm breath on her temple, \u201cyou see, star, the body learns even when the mind is trying to pay the rent.\u201d\n\nWhen they stopped, the clocks everywhere seemed to discover that they had been neglected and began to announce themselves. She sat on the bleachers and found that her skirt had acquired a chalk smear that looked like the ghost of a palm. The envelope in her bag felt like a second heart. If she closed her eyes, she could see the sectioned red of the train seats and the smear of countryside that would serve as a thinking place. \u201cWe need a dress,\u201d Rafa\u00ebl said, as if the sentence might conjure one.\n\n\u201cI have been imagining the dress like a country,\u201d she said. \u201cI plan to move there and become a minor official.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be the minister of making people gasp,\u201d he said, making a little courtly bow with his stupid holey sweater, and she wanted to kiss the crown of his head the way one kisses a child before sending him somewhere dangerous.\n\nOn Sunday, the city put on its underclothes and went out anyway. The market along the quai was flapped into shape by wind; the women who sold cheese held knives whose reflections looked like birds. She had made a plan that seemed to her like a good lie\u2014she would find something secondhand that felt like a secret agreeing to be visible. The first shop smelled of starch and old quarrels. A bell announced her and a woman without eyebrows gave her a glance that felt like a sting test. There were dresses in every register of the past: taffeta sighs, beaded sentences, the optimisms of decades she had not been alive for. She touched them the way one touches a dream, with the tips of her fingers. None of them were right, not because they were ugly\u2014they were all beautiful, even the ridiculous ones\u2014but because they were stories that would not be hers to tell.\n\nIn a smaller shop on the side street where the pavement buckled over the roots of an arrogant plane tree, she found a dress that had once been worn by a woman who believed in telephones that connected quickly. It was a dark green that sometimes thought it was black, cut on the bias with the particular intelligence of someone who liked knees. Sequins were absent, which made her feel more honest. The price, penciled on a tag with a cheerful lie, was less awful than she had feared, but not nothing. \u201cTry,\u201d said the woman behind the counter, who was not the kind of woman with eyebrows but was the kind with wrists that had done work.\n\nIn the curtained space where all the mirrors disagreed with each other a little, she put it on. It slid over her like a kind argument. The strap on the left side had seen things and needed a sure needle. The hem would have to learn where her ankle was. But the dress did to her shoulders what she pretended not to know she wanted dresses to do. She stepped out and the woman put her head to one side, appraising with the practice of a person who has watched many strangers come out of many curtains. \u201cIf you were two centimeters taller,\u201d she said, \u201cI would call it destiny. As it is, we will call it work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can pay a deposit,\u201d \u00c9lise said, and the sentence made a clean wound in the air. The woman nodded, as if the air had been bleeding all day, and named a number with the mercy in it already. \u00c9lise counted out bills and felt both humiliated and saved. They made arrangements like people make arrangements about children at the end of parties\u2014when to return, where to meet, what to do if the weather changed its mind. She stepped back into her own clothes and felt as if she had removed not a dress but a version of herself that had reluctantly agreed to exist.\n\nBack at the apartment, the rent notice lay where she had left it, patient, sure of itself in the way only paper seems allowed to be. The tenth would be Monday. She sat down to compose a message to the landlord that would sound the way she needed it to sound: apologetic but dignified, temporary in its request, explicit in its promise. She stared at the empty message and thought of Jules\u2019s spoon-voice. She thought of the envelope in her bag and the cash she had kissed into train tickets and deposit. She called instead of writing, because she had learned that sometimes the sound of a human throat can do what text cannot.\n\n\u201cMadame Hanriot,\u201d she said when the woman answered, and then apologised for calling on a Sunday because she was French and had been raised to respect leisure as if it were a religion. \u201cIt\u2019s Martin. In 3C. I wanted to ask if I might pay on the twelfth. There has been a delay. I can bring it to you, first thing, before I go to work.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, full and businesslike. She could hear, behind the woman, a television that had not decided whether to be tragic or entertaining. \u201cThe twelfth is after the tenth,\u201d said Madame Hanriot, as if mathematics might persuade her that kindness had no place here.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said \u00c9lise, and let her voice show its naked hands. \u201cIt will not be a habit. It will be this once. If it were not\u2014\u201d and here she almost said if it were not the dance but bit the words back because it would only make her sound childish and, besides, not everyone believed in the ways one saved oneself\u2014\u201cif it were not this week, I would not ask.\u201d\n\nAnother pause, then the sound of a woman taking off a pair of glasses and putting them back on. \u201cThe twelfth,\u201d the landlord said at last. \u201cBut you will bring it. You will not slide it under my door at midnight. And you will not make me call you again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will bring it,\u201d said \u00c9lise, who could have gone on saying it like a mantra, because sometimes saying yes is the only proof one can offer.\n\nShe hung up and stood completely still just long enough to feel the tears come and go without lodging. The relief made a kind of space in her that she immediately filled with dread of what she had promised. She opened the window a little and the city sent in a smell of wet leaves and motor oil that did more for her than any perfume.\n\nOn Monday the school returned to its riverbed. Children poured and pooled; grown-ups built small banks with their bodies. Camille came to her at break, poem in hand and a giddiness on her face like a secret she was willing to share. \u201cI took the line about the jacket out,\u201d she said breathlessly, \u201cbecause I thought it was maybe a different poem. But then I made something new with it at home, and maybe it is two poems, and I felt a little like a thief and a little like God.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is writing,\u201d said \u00c9lise, who wanted to say everything else as well, wanted to say I am proud of you and I would like to live in those little seconds where you discover yourself, but who knew not to pack a child\u2019s pockets with adult sentences. \u201cBring both tomorrow. We will see which is which, and they will both be themselves.\u201d\n\nRenaud, later, leaned against her classroom door with a paper cup he had for once not burned and said, \u201cI spoke to Anne this weekend,\u201d with a studied lightness that meant this was a sentence with a heavy core. Anne was the opera singer who had taught him what it was to be both astonished and exhausted by a person. \u201cShe said she would come to Paris if she could get the Sunday train. She said to tell you that a stage is a ship and if you are not a little sick you are not far enough from shore.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnne is a menace,\u201d \u00c9lise said, and they both smiled because love and menace often share a wardrobe. \u201cDoes she have\u2014\u201d she began, and then did not want to say it. \u201cDoes she have, by any chance, opinions about dresses that have holes in their straps?\u201d\n\nRenaud\u2019s look brightened with the relief of someone who has been waiting to be useful. \u201cOpinions are her raw material,\u201d he said, taking out his phone as if opinions could be ordered like bread. \u201cShe will have a sewing kit the size of a pharmacy. She will live for this.\u201d\n\nThe days made their little beads and slid along the string. When the tenth passed like a truck that did not stop at her door, she felt temporarily lightheaded and then, sensibly, went and lay down on the couch for ten minutes to let her blood think. The dress was ready for its trial. The woman at the shop had made the strap suddenly certain and had taught the hem to respect her ankle. When \u00c9lise turned in the mirror, she saw someone who could pass for the kind of person who deserves a trumpet. She held very still and let the feeling pass through without resistance, the way she had learned to let grief pass through years ago, so that it would not settle stubbornly in an organ and declare itself king.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the studio belonged to them. The boy with the earbuds had gone early to a job in a pizzeria; the furious couple had broken up in a way that involved chairs and apologies and then returned to the room pretending to have learned something. The air had that soft electrical smell that studios and power stations share. She warmed her ankles with devotion. He did the ridiculous jumps that made him feel like a boy again and made her feel that the ceiling was only a suggestion. They ran the piece in full, paused, altered the smallest gesture at the ninth second because sometimes it is the ninth second that saves you. When they stopped, a fine trembling had taken up residence in her hands. He looked at her and nodded as if to say yes, this is how we know we are alive.\n\nOutside, the city offered an evening that had been cut slightly too short and mended with neon. They walked without meaning to, past the bakery with its olive bread, past the shop where she had not bought lemons, past a man who was singing a song to himself that had no words. \u201cWhen we get there,\u201d said Rafa\u00ebl, \u201cwe will do our forgetting. We will forget the list, we will forget that there is a name for what we are doing, we will forget that other people have eyes.\u201d He looked at her and had that look he sometimes had, the one that made her think of bridges, not because he wanted to cross, but because he understood the engineering. \u201cWe will not forget each other,\u201d he added, almost as an afterthought, and the afterthought was truer than the sentence.\n\nAt home, there was a message from Jules. It had two parts. The first was a photograph of a turtle shell that had washed up on a beach he had been visiting with his children, the kind of thing the sea gives you like a joke. The second was a sentence that said, simply, I was not kind. The sentence had been written as if it had to be smuggled past guards. She held the phone and walked circles in the small apartment as if planning a parade. She wrote back, finally, I am in the final. There will be a trivial trophy. There will be music. I will be in Paris on Tuesday. She sent it without reading it again, because if she read it again she would begin to make it polite, and nothing has ever been saved by politeness.\n\nThat night, she dreamed of the studio clean and empty. The windows were open on every wall and the river had come in without bothering to use the door and was moving the benches around with the gentle entitlement of an old friend. She stepped into the water in her dress and it did not cling to her; it moved the way seaweed moves, on purpose and with a sense of humor. There were spectators on the bleachers, but their faces were not her mother\u2019s. They were people she did not know, which felt like mercy. When she woke, she could still feel the slight resistance water gives to a calf, and it gave her a confidence she did not accept with her mind but accepted with her ankles.\n\nThe train day arrived at last with the ridiculous precision of a clock whose hands had been chastened. She woke before the alarm because happiness is a good alarm. She ate half a banana and a piece of toast with nothing on it, because stomachs at such times are conservative. She packed the USB stick with the music as if it were a vial of medicine. She put the dress into a bag that made no claim to its grandeur. Her apartment felt suddenly like a stage set for a life she would pick up again on Wednesday, plates standing in little cities on the drying rack, a book on the arm of the chair open to the place where a woman was about to say something foolish. She turned off the radiators as if she were saying goodbye to a pet.\n\nAt the station, the boards with their brittle clatter presented the city with its choices. People took themselves to be delivered. Rafa\u00ebl arrived with a suitcase he had borrowed from a cousin, a square thing with stickers from places neither of them had been. He had shaved, which suited him and made her suspicious. \u201cI did not sleep,\u201d he confessed, and then immediately slept for ten minutes on the plastic seat while she watched their bags and the enormous minutes roll by.\n\nOn the platform, as the train made its long flirtation with stopping, Anne appeared like a person herself late from an aria. She wore a jacket the color of dangerous fruit and had, indeed, a sewing kit. She kissed \u00c9lise with noise and said, \u201cYou will be fine, because you have cheekbones,\u201d and kissed Rafa\u00ebl and said, \u201cYou will be fine because of your regret.\u201d She was everything Renaud had described and also nothing like him, which is how affection tells its truth. In the compartment, she took out a tin of pins and a small jar of jam, which seemed to \u00c9lise like the perfect inventory for a person. \u201cWe will fix anything that is broken,\u201d she said, and said nothing at all about rent or grit or deserving, which endeared her.\n\nThe train conducted them with authority into beginning. Fields performed their trick of changing without leaving. The sky didn\u2019t bother with a thesis. People around them did the ordinary miracles of travel: a woman rode while making a to-do list that included the word happiness underlined twice, a boy slept in a position only boys will trust, a man made eye contact with his own reflection and seemed not to enjoy what he saw. Rafa\u00ebl woke, ate a piece of bread as if bread were an invention he was proud of, and took her hand without looking at her, as if to warm a tool.\n\nParis received them with its usual unintimidated face. The station breathed them out. The taxi delivered them to a side street near the Carr\u00e9, where trucks were being asked to be graceful and men were making good work look like chaos. Backstage, the corridor had that austere smell of clean floor and concentrated dreams. Names were being stuck to doors with tape; everywhere there was the rustling paper sound of people telling themselves they were prepared. Their dressing room was a square of light and a rack. It had a mirror framed with bulbs that told the truth and got away with it.\n\nThey rehearsed their walk from the wings to the mark, because walking is something people forget to study when they are trying to do something else. The stage, unlit, was indifferent to them in a way that comforted her. On the far side, two women practiced quiet violence in heels and did not fall. A small man with a moustache arranged trust into cables. A girl of seventeen, fragile and invincible, put on lashes as if she were laying a road.\n\nAt sound check, their brass rose like a hand in the dark and touched the upper air. The room answered with its own throat. \u00c9lise felt the small trick of the floor beneath its sprung astonishment and thought, absurdly, of soup coolers in school cafeterias with their inexhaustible vats. Anne pinned the dress in two secret places and gave the strap a last bit of encouragement that was technical and also, somehow, maternal. \u201cYou can eat a fruit,\u201d Anne commanded, handing her a plum that did in fact taste like a small decision. \u201cNot more. Your stomach will betray you.\u201d\n\nIn the hour between knowing that something will happen and watching it happen, time sometimes goes to sit in the hallway and is replaced by a simpler cousin. They warmed their backs against a wall; they spoke in a pidgin of their own that did not mention the names of gods. Renaud texted a photo of the staff room with the caption the burnt has been replaced by the overboiled, which made her laugh while making her want to cry. Jules sent two words: Go well. She felt those words like two small weights in each pocket, the kind that keep a woman\u2019s dress from flying up in wind.\n\nWhen they were called, it was like stepping into a smell she had known all her life and could not name. Rafa\u00ebl pressed his mouth once to the top of her head, which their arrangement both allowed and forbade. The lights did their mad insects dance and then settled; the audience became not one large animal but a discipline. She could hear the hush in its shoes. She put her foot on the mark that someone had taped where the world expects feet to go. The music began in exactly the place she had dreamed it would begin, and they did not lose each other even once.\n\nThere is, sometimes, a moment in dancing when the future does not exist and neither does the past, when the body is not a bank account or a mistake or a promise of something better, but only an engine beloved by the matter that surrounds it. She knew she had arrived in that place the way one knows one has closed a door properly\u2014by the lack of any noise from it, by the way the wind ceases to be a question. Their last turn sharpened itself into relief. They ended not at the edge of a laugh but at the bottom of a breath, holding themselves open just long enough that the room could pour something into them that was not audible.\n\nApplause is sometimes a polite rain, sometimes a weather one has no right to. This was the second kind. She looked at him, not because they shared their glory but because they shared the ridiculousness of being people who had asked for that glory aloud. They bowed as if it were a joke they had told themselves, and walked off like waiters who had not dropped a single glass.\n\nBackstage had discovered them and began to make of them a story, the way backstages do because they cannot help themselves. A woman they had never met kissed her cheeks and immediately corrected her posture. A man in a hat told Rafa\u00ebl that his line was clean and then explained to someone standing behind them what a clean line was. Anne dabbed a place on the dress that did not need dabbing and then hugged her so completely that for three seconds she could not have said what direction was.\n\nThey did not wait for the results the way normal people wait for weather. They said a sentence to each other three times\u2014We did not die\u2014and each time it meant something different. When the list went up in its bureaucratic font, she had to stand on her toes to see over a man\u2019s shoulder. Their names were there, not at the top like the kind of story people adore, but not in the middle either, in that place where something like endurance lives. Third. The number looked compassionate and exacting, and it had the side benefit of not asking them to make speeches that would later humiliate them when they remembered what their mouths had done.\n\nThey took their trophy\u2014gladiators as promised, so small and self-serious she loved them\u2014and she felt the way she sometimes felt after kissing, which was that the world was nothing but a surface she now understood better. In the corner of the room, a girl cried for reasons that were either disappointment or the exhausting relief of not having to be hopeful for three hours. Rafa\u00ebl leaned his forehead against hers and said nothing, and the nothing made her think of that year in the house with the sickroom noises and the nurses with ships for bodies, and of the first time she had taken a step toward music without asking anyone for permission.\n\nOn the train back, Anne slept with the sewing kit on her lap like a cat. Outside, the fields used up their remaining green. Rafa\u00ebl held the trophy and made it walk along the edge of the window as if it were brave and on a ledge. They did not talk about money. They did not talk about the twelfth being not a miracle but a day, and the rent waiting like a dog behind a door. Anne woke just enough to say, \u201cWhen you are very old you will remember the feel of your foot at the end of that turn and it will be worth half a lifetime of being sensible,\u201d and fell back into sleep, trusting them to understand that sometimes a blessing arrives wearing a ridiculous hat.\n\nAt the station in Lyon, the air smelled of their own city\u2019s mixture of bread and concrete. They carried the suitcase between them as if it were a cradle. In the taxi, there was a radio program that had invited a philosopher to talk about usefulness and art, and \u00c9lise laughed so abruptly that the driver looked at her in the mirror with the concern of a man who will have to clean the back seat if things go wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said, though it was, in fact, everything. \u201cIt is only that for once I have no argument to make.\u201d\n\nAt home, the apartment greeted her with its water pipes\u2019 frankness. She set the gladiators on the table and placed beside them the rent notice for the morning, and the little pile of cash that would join the rest and make good on a promise. She undressed with the carefulness one uses with borrowed things. In the mirror, she saw a woman whose hair had decided to be ridiculous and a line at the corner of her mouth she had not noticed yesterday. She put her palm to her sternum where the old woman in the fuchsia backpack had touched her and felt that bell still vibrating. It was a low sound, and it made the glasses on the shelf think about moving, and it was hers.",

The gladiators on the table had fallen in the night with a clink so modest that it had crossed into her dream and politely leaned against the wall there, and she righted them with two fingers and told them not to get ideas. The rent notice lay beside them like a cousin who enjoyed being correct. She washed her face at the sink where the mirror always made her a little more gray and a little more industrious, and she tied her hair back with the elastic she had found last week beneath a tram seat, because sometimes luck is simply deciding to pick something up that other people do not want. When she counted the envelope a final time, the bills seemed lighter for having already been promised, like children ready for a school trip who are determined not to cause trouble.\n\nIn the stairwell, the damp smelled like a noncommittal apology, and the neighbor\u2019s boy had left the bicycle in a position that suggested optimism about gravity. On the second floor landing, Madame Hanriot\u2019s door was open a crack, which in that building meant either catastrophe or company, and when she knocked lightly she heard the television\u2019s underfed chatter and the urgent concentration of a cat demanding to be let out of a closed room. The landlord appeared with her glasses on a chain and that expression of someone who has never been late for anything except, perhaps, joy, and \u00c9lise held out the envelope with both hands as if it were a ceremony they had prepared for together. They did the little arithmetic aloud, for the god of exactness, and then Madame Hanriot surprised her by glancing past her shoulder into the corridor and saying, almost confidingly, that when she had been nineteen she had once driven to Marseille on a whim to see a man dance on a table, and that it had been a great waste of petrol and a very important expenditure all the same.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t dance,\u201d the older woman said then, with the investigating curiosity of someone who has seen shoes and shoulders but prefers to be told.\n\n\u201cI dance enough to have to ask you for the twelfth,\u201d said \u00c9lise, and the smile they shared was the kind women share when they have both kept an account no one else has access to. At the end of the exchange, Madame Hanriot put three euros into \u00c9lise\u2019s palm with the crispness of a notary and said they were from the meter downstairs which had begun to work properly again, and the absurdity of the tiny refund made them both laugh a little longer than the amount deserved, because laughter at such a scale is an excuse to like each other without committing to anything.\n\nThe walk to the coll\u00e8ge tasted of tin and bakery, and at the corner by the butcher the fennel smell was practicing for better weather. The school\u2019s front door, painted a municipal green that resisted sophistication, had been propped with a chair, which meant something had broken and custodians were dealing with it by allowing air to pretend to be a hinge. In the staff room, the coffee wore an expression of resigned virtue; Renaud had been beaten to the machine by someone unimaginative, and was stirring a small tub of yogurt with the philosophical attention people give to white substances in early hours. When she lifted the trophy out of her bag, letting the gladiators inspect the crumbs of chalk and the folded newspaper that enumerated tragedies briskly, he made a sound that was nearly a curse and then kissed the top of one small bronze head with a flourish that was entirely unserious and entirely sincere.\n\n\u201cYou brought Rome to us,\u201d he said, and set the figurine on the shelf that held, among other things, three ceramic owls and a plant that had decided to convert dust into a lifestyle. \u201cWe are an empire again. Now the coffee may burn with dignity.\u201d\n\nShe told it all quickly, the way one tells news that has already turned into memory, because otherwise it begins to tell you. She told the hush and the brass and the way the end had felt like holding a breath she could finally release into a room that understood her. Renaud, who would have mocked any word that admitted to being noble, kept his face serious for the duration and then, perhaps realizing he had managed to be grave for too long, announced that an electrician had been reluctant to fix the photocopier because he claimed it had ambitions, and that therefore today\u2019s copies might come out like poetic fragments, which would suit her perfectly. She laughed, and beneath the laughter she felt the small animal of fatigue curl itself against her ribs in a way that felt affectionate rather than predatory, as if her body had decided to protect her by asking only for a chair.\n\nCamille arrived at break with hair that had decided to be bigger than her face, breathless not from running but from being awake in a world that had finally given her two poems. She handed over the pages with a solemnity that warned against jokes and then hovered, pretending to read a poster about a debate club. The first poem had been cut cleanly where it had needed it, not like a martyr but like an adult, and the line about the jacket had, as promised, been given a room of its own, where it had invited a lamp and a silent rug. They talked in the back of the classroom where the light made people honest, about what happens when a metaphor gets tired, about what generosity between lines might look like, and about the kind of bravery it takes to discard something perfectly written because it has hidden the thing you were trying to say. Camille\u2019s mother had written at the top in a pinched hand that she did not understand the thing about the father and the jacket, and they agreed that often the people being written about must be allowed to be wrong.\n\nThe day put on its clothes and stood in front of her the way days always do in schools, stubbornly practical in their shoelaces and their whistles. During the third hour, the headmaster arrived at her door with the dignified flurry of a minor official whose world has developed a leak, and asked, in that way he had of prefacing decisions with the word \u201cunfortunately,\u201d whether she might, what with her success in things pertaining to rhythm, consider organizing a weekly club for students who bore a dangerous quantity of fidgets. There would be no money, of course, except in the budget where money is kept for things seen to be desirable by committees, and perhaps if she wrote a grant application, which was the secular prayer these days, something might be arranged. She kept her mouth from saying something that would taste good and then upset her stomach, and said instead that she would think and draft and find a way to make a floor remember feet. He smiled with relief and moved on like a trolley.\n\nAfter classes, the school emptied itself in a performance that had been rehearsed for decades, and the courtyard let go its racket and then became a place where a solitary ball sought a friend and a woman with a clipboard pretended to be more official than she felt. She took the trophy to show the library, because the librarian loved objects and thought books were better when they had to share the air with things that had weight. He placed it between a dictionary that knew too much and a glass jar of marbles that he used to explain randomness to children who understood it intuitively, and he asked her to write a small label. The word gladiator, handwritten, struck her as both faintly ridiculous and correct, which is probably what the truth looks like when it wears a costume.\n\nShe went home the long way, because she could, because the rent had been paid and the world had not punished her for being absurd. The river was in a green mood and the sky had decided to practice being larger than it needed to be, and on the embankment an old man fed a piece of bread to a dog so tenderly that the bread seemed to become a new organ. The fuchsia backpack appeared to her peripherally before its owner did, as some objects announce their people, and the old woman from the studio called out to her as if greeting a niece she had briefly misplaced. They stood together watching damp swans be overpraised by tourists, and the woman told her that she had once learned every step of a Cha-Cha in a single night because she was trying to forget a man whose name began with M and who had owned a bakery and a darkness. It had worked for three months, which is a result most religions would envy.\n\nAt the apartment, the silence was a kind one, and she set down her bag, unpinned her hair, and did the small domestic trick of making a sandwich feel like an accomplishment. The trophy looked patient and foolish on the table, and when she brushed it with her thumb the dust there gave up its place generously. There was an email from Madame Giraud, whose consonants always felt like a firm hand, congratulating them again and attaching a small, polite request for a two-sentence quote to be used in a local write-up, and she wrote something that she hoped would make her future self less likely to wince. She thanked the stage, which is a sentimental thing to do, and she thanked the people who had invented the screws that made it possible for boards to pretend to be silence.\n\nRafa\u00ebl sent a message that was a photograph of his wrist with a blister the size of a coin and the caption my kingdom for a glove, and she sent back instructions about warm water and ridiculously expensive creams and he replied with a picture of a tin of old-fashioned salve that he claimed could cure both leaks and heartbreak. They met at the studio anyway, because you do not stop touching the door just because it opened once, and there they practiced not the piece but the habit. He did the thing where he put his hand at the small of her back without demand, the way one makes a promise to a wall when one is drunk, and she felt that sore triumphant place in her body where triumph has left a bruise and decided to name it. They tried a step they had abandoned months ago because it had made her feel as if she were a coin being tossed into an uncertain hat, and this time it felt like a leaf returning to a tree; they kept it and were possibly ridiculous for doing so.\n\nThey argued with pleasure about what would come next, as people argue when the thing just done has protected them from the future for a day or two. He wanted to sign them up for a spring festival on a square where the stones had seen men behead fish and women argue the price of apricots, while she wanted to spend a month doing nothing except finding a way to teach Camille to stand with her shoulders where shoulders are supposed to be. He called her a saint with bad knees and she called him an apostle with bandaged wrists, and the boy with earbuds looked up from his acrobatics long enough to grin and then go back to letting gravity teach him and ignoring it anyway.\n\nIn the late evening, when the city begins to withdraw its offers and ask instead for stories, she stood at her window and watched two men carry a sofa across the street without the help of kindness, and she thought how some objects pass through lives like ministers and others like friends. Jules\u2019 message arrived with a pause built into it, as if it had sat by itself on a bench for a while before deciding whether to cross a street. He said he would be in Lyon on Friday with the children, that he had promised them a museum and the funicular, and that if she had time they would like to see her face in the large. He did not mention the word sorry again, which pleased her because repetition makes apology cheap, and he did not threaten to bring a lecture, which pleased her because she was not a child and had no desire to audition for that role. She wrote back that she would meet them near the fountain where pigeons practiced being citizens, and she imagined his daughters counting lions and being unmoved by history.\n\nSleep found her like an afterthought, and she welcomed it like a lover who has learned to knock. In the morning, her ankle did the small complaint that meant she had treated it like a democracy and it had preferred a benevolent dictatorship, and she promised it sympathy in the form of warm water and attention. The day\u2019s lessons involved the subjunctive, which made everyone briefly wish for death and then become dignified, and in the second class a boy asked why one needed to talk about what might not be true, and she answered that without it no one could write a love letter or threaten revenge or imagine their lives into a shape they could bear, and he looked at her with that face children sometimes have when they ask a question for one reason and receive an answer that grows a new room in their house.\n\nIn the afternoon, she went to the headmaster with her draft of a club that did not want to be called a club because that word had sat too long under posters with clip-art. She proposed, instead, a laboratory of movement where feet and sentences could conspire, and he, perhaps unexpectedly, set down his pen and admitted that as a child he had once wished to be a tightrope walker until his father, a man of lists, had convinced him that the world required more men who could sign documents. They worked out a schedule between them like a truce, and she left with the sense of having smuggled a small contraband across a border that had been left, for a moment, unguarded.\n\nOn Thursday evening, the apartment of her childhood sent its ghost in the form of a smell that did not belong to her building\u2014boiled chicken and a kind of institutional orange\u2014and she stood very still until it passed, because memory is a bully until you refuse to give it attention. She took the bus to the shop with the dress to bring the woman a small plant wrapped in paper because gratitude is better worn than spoken, and found the counter attended by a young man with shoulders who called for his mother with the composed irritation of a person who has watched thread his whole life. The woman emerged with a pin in her mouth and kissed both of \u00c9lise\u2019s cheeks without removing the pin, then nodded at the dress where it hung with an expression she seemed to believe reflected well upon herself. They joked about the strap\u2019s behavior onstage, as if it had been a teenager, and in parting the woman said that the dresses that did the least work often did the most good, which \u00c9lise tried to hear as philosophy and not as evidence against her own desire for instruments that glitter.\n\nFriday took on the shape of a plan. Jules texted that they were on the 10:12 and that the children had eaten something sweet that had converted their bones to air, and she prepared herself to receive her nieces with a face that would make them believe in aunts. At the square, the pigeons did their municipal business and the fountain performed its stately nonsense, and the two girls approached with the motion of people who have taught their shoes to love running more than they love feet. The older was lanky and suspicious and the younger was a small justice of the peace; both attached themselves to her waist with the generous greed of family, and Jules arrived with that smile he uses when he does not know how to be forgiven and a day-old beard that made him look like his father, which made her want to kiss and hit him in quick succession.\n\nThey did the things people do when they have not quarrelled about anything that can be fixed by doing things. They rode the funicular and pretended to be unimpressed and failed, and the girls loved a painting because it had a dog in it, and in the cramped lunch hour they ate sandwiches that hurt the gums and pretended they did not, and Jules told her a story about his youngest refusing to accept that rain existed because it had not yet rained on her birthday, and she told him a story about Anne\u2019s sewing kit containing a jam that tasted of confession. Between the jokes there were small plazas where quiet could stand, and in one of those he said he should not have written the sentence about watching her hurt herself, that he had meant he did not know how to help and that watching someone you love not be saved by what they love is the sort of puzzle that ruins men who like solutions.\n\n\u201cI am not a problem,\u201d she said, and they both smiled at the silliness of the sentence because everything is a problem if you look at it from the right angle, and then she took his hand, which was no longer the boy\u2019s hand she remembered and not yet the old man\u2019s hand she did not want to consider, and squeezed once. The girls climbed on the lion\u2019s stone back and declared war on an invisible army, which is the sort of war adults ought to have to fight daily for exercise.\n\nAt the studio that evening, she and Rafa\u00ebl gave themselves the luxury of dancing badly on purpose, which is to say they let themselves laugh at their feet and taught their shoulders that grace is sometimes a matter of timing and sometimes a matter of consenting to be ridiculous. A salsa night had been announced by a flyer with a photograph of a couple whose lips seemed unsure whether to belong to their own faces, and they considered joining the crowd that would later call names of steps to one another as if ordering drinks. In the end they stayed in their familiar square, because even f\u00eates can be a burden, and because among their own mirrors and their own benches they did not have to be received by strangers who might decide to love them for the wrong reasons.\n\nSaturday was the kind of day that hides a needle in a cushion. The morning made itself easy, and she did the useful nothing of errands until the afternoon asked for an accounting. She had promised herself she would not touch the envelope of leftover cash because promises are an architecture and she was tired of rebuilding, but then a bill arrived with the urgency of red ink and the postman\u2019s apology, and she sat with the paper in her hand long enough to give it the shape of something that could kill her if she let it land. She called the company, which presented itself as an idea and a menu, and waited through a version of a song that someone had chosen for its ability to be unnoticed. When a person finally arrived at the other end of the line, breathing had never seemed so significant. The human voice reduced the threat in the paper by half, which is what voices do, and together they negotiated a delay and a reduction and an agreement that she would call again before the calendar did. She hung up and felt exemplary, then immediately humiliated by the smallness of the achievement, and she went to the window and watched the street for a while until a man with a ladder taught her that balance is not a metaphor and then made it one by nearly falling and laughing.\n\nLate in the day, a message from Giraud arrived like a note slid across a table by someone competent. There would be, she wrote with the tidy optimism of a schedule, a small showcase at the end of the month for those who had placed, and a short interview filmed for social channels whose hunger she would not insult by underestimating. If they wished to be included, they need only say yes and bring the dress that had caused a backstage debate among the seamstresses about bias and idiocy. \u00c9lise read the email twice, then a third time with one hand on her chest where the bell had been touched and told the air that she would, yes, continue to say yes because saying no had never saved her from anything worth being saved from. She texted Rafa\u00ebl, who replied first with caution because he had learned to distrust the moment after victory, and then with a photograph of his shoes lined up as if they had somewhere to be.\n\nWhen Sunday came, the city allowed itself a certain laxity in the angles of things. She went to the market and bought two apples that had decided to be old in an elegant way, and a small fish that looked like a confession and would later be delicious with lemon and a stubborn herb. She ran into the librarian buying mushrooms and they discussed the trophy\u2019s placement as if it were a student with needs. On her way home, she paused by the poster for the finals and this time did not look away immediately, allowing herself to see the strangers in their good architecture, and then allowing herself to be a little bored of them because she had come to believe in the usefulness of boredom as a weapon against envy.\n\nThat afternoon she wrote her grant application like a woman writing a love letter to a desk. She used the words people like to see when they must give money they would rather hoard: outreach, community, resilience, inclusivity, scaffolding, measurable. She made it honest where it could bear it and made it clever where honesty would bore, and when she had finished she read it aloud to the plants that had never asked anything of her but water and a certain dignity, and sent it, then stood and practiced not thinking about whether anyone would read the thing she had written. She had learned, over the years, that one cannot live awaiting replies without becoming a person whose face has no patience left in it, and she had decided, perhaps foolishly and certainly stubbornly, that she would rather have lines that showed the work of laughing.\n\nIn the evening, because celebration is a muscle you must use or lose, she put on the dress that was not the dress and went to the bar near the river where an accordion had taken up residence, and there she let herself be taken into three dances with a stranger whose hands were honest and whose breath was noisy, and into a fourth with a woman who led like a promise that wanted to be forgiven. Around her, the city made noises that had nothing to do with her and everything to do with what it means to be in a place with others, and she thought of the girls at the studio with their knees like breadsticks and the boys with their earbud catechisms, and of the way Camille had said she felt like a thief and a little like God. She went home with her ankles doing their commentary, and in the kitchen she ate the fish with lemon and the honest herb and let the juice run onto her wrist, and decided that the evening had been a small success in the direction of not asking every hour to give her a reason for itself.\n\nOn Monday, the laboratory of movement became not a plan but a door someone had opened, and six children walked through it as if they had been waiting outside for weeks. They came in pairs and alone, with shyness like a scarf around the neck and bravado like a hat worn too low. She moved the desks back, which made the room look briefly unemployed, and put on not music but a metronome that had once belonged to a piano teacher who wore pearls in solidarity with order. They began with the scandalous instruction to stand still and feel where their feet were, which made two boys giggle and a girl look dangerous, and then she had them walk to the far wall and back in silence as if the floor were someone who needed to be convinced. Someone asked if there would be prizes and she said yes, but not the kind that glitter, and she did not apologize for being mystical because children live in a world where mysticism is the only politics that makes sense.\n\nThey played the game where one person closes their eyes and another leads with the lightest touch of a finger on a sleeve, and when one of the boys tried to turn it into a slapstick, the girl from 5B who carried herself like a question mark said, without malice, that this was serious, and the boy made the face of someone discovering that seriousness is not a punishment. At the end, sweaty from nothing and flushed from permission, they sat cross-legged and she asked them to say one true thing about their bodies that was not an insult, and at first they resisted and then a small stampede of exhausted truth arrived\u2014my arms are good at carrying, my back hurts when I lie, my feet know the way home\u2014and she felt that bell in her chest move like a creature in a well.\n\nThe week smoothed itself into something like a promise that one could be borne. She and Rafa\u00ebl met in the evenings and developed the kind of confidentiality about exhaustion that people develop when they trust one another with ugliness. He came one night with a story about the job in Oullins in which a pipe had confessed to being older than the men responsible for it, and she came another with a story about a mother whose eyes had asked permission to cry while her mouth asked for grammar exercises for a child who ate paper, and between stories they moved, because that is what bodies do when words have run out of their usefulness.\n\nIn the small hours on Friday, waking because some neighbor\u2019s door had decided to be enthusiastic, she lay in the exact position she had lay in when she was ten and believed the ceiling must need her eyes to stay up, and she listened for the details that separate one insomnia from another. The city sent a siren and a laugh; her radiator rehearsed its clucks; a couple upstairs negotiated a silence; a cat on a wall decided against risk. She thought of the girl who had cried backstage and of Anne\u2019s jam and of the train with its confident face, and of Jules and his daughters with their lion-conquering, and of the old woman\u2019s hand at her sternum, and she began to imagine the room where the showcase would be, and the angle at which she would carry her shoulder into the second turn so that the strap would not argue, and the exact moment at which she would find Rafa\u00ebl\u2019s palm and let herself be led away from the fact that she would always have to ask some version of a stranger to trust her.\n\nBy the time the alarm performed its tiny marvel, her mind had already flown three circuits of a day, and still a kind of contentment was available to her as she dressed, in the form of a sweater that had not yet decided to betray her at the elbows and the knowledge that she had paid what she owed and was not being hunted by a piece of paper. She put the gladiators on the shelf beside the cheap potted plant she had once bought in pity and which now insisted upon being a tree, and she said good morning to both of them with a ridiculous courtesy, and then she went out to find the world in the mood for what she could bear to offer.",

                              "content": "Chapter 6\n\nThe week that followed put on an ordinary coat and then found a rose in its pocket, and the simple discovery made everything else smell faintly of patience. Mornings were back to being assemblies of damp scarves and low clouds with opinions, the Sa\u00f4ne practicing its restrained breathing between the stone shoulders that disciplined it, and her feet learned the winter route again, which involved exactly two puddles, a bakery window with a charitable \u00e9clair, and the butcher\u2019s fennel that insisted on appearing in every season as if it had an appointment with her lungs. The little gladiators took to their shelf in the staff room with an air of having been sent ahead to reserve a table for victory, and the plant beside them, encouraged by this brass companionship, produced one surprised leaf that Renaud claimed to have coaxed with Handel and a speech about excellence. She took pleasure in the stiff routines because they allowed her to hide bits of brightness inside them like postcards slipped into thick books, and because after the kind of night where applause still lives in the body as a new organ, one needs somewhere to put the organ down for a while without breaking it.\n\nThe movement laboratory became a regular appointment, which is to say it became complicated in the way commitments become complicated as soon as they acquire their own furniture. At the second session, a very small boy named Farid, who was the size of an object one might place deliberately on a bookshelf, arrived with a letter from his mother signed with five different loops and an insistence that he would not, could not, should not remove his shoes in public, and she wrote back in the elegant neutral of a teacher\u2019s note that he could keep his shoes on so long as he promised to learn to feel his feet without anyone else seeing him do it. The girl from 5B who had looked dangerous last week arrived wearing defiance that had been ironed, and when the boys made jokes about touching with a fingertip she suggested, with a perfectly pleasant voice, that anyone who giggled at permission would not be included in the part where the music came in. By the end of the hour, the floor had given up its indifference, and when she told them to walk as if the world were listening and they were saying something true with their knees, they tried, and in trying made a sound that could not be heard except by the dust.\n\nAt school as in life, small accommodations took on the look of progress. The headmaster sent a message with the kind of subject line one writes to oneself in hope\u2014funding possibility, movement\u2014and she met him in his office where a bowl of citrus tried to make a philosophy of freshness. Together they coaxed her grant application into a form that did not scare committees and did not disgust her, adding a paragraph about how bodies that understand themselves tend to harm others less, and subtracting a sentence she had loved about the way a metronome can act as a friend. He told her about a boy he had once taught who had taken up the bassoon to avoid violence, and she told him about a girl who had traded silence for a step, and between them the room acquired a temperate hope, which is the only kind that lasts. When she left, he pressed three photocopy tokens into her palm as if they were coins to cross a river, and she thanked him with more feeling than the coins deserved because, often, it is not the object but the shared belief in it that makes it holy.\n\nRafa\u00ebl, meanwhile, acquired an injury with theatrical modesty. At the site near Oullins, a coil of copper, affronted by its own stubbornness, had snapped back and found his wrist with the unerring nose of humiliation, leaving a half-moon bruise that looked like punctuation. He texted a photograph of it that made the hand appear both heroic and ridiculous, and when she met him at the studio he offered up the offended limb with a comic solemnity that made her want to blow on it as if he were a child and she possessed a mother\u2019s breath. The injury was not ruinous, but it asked for respect, and respect in dance is often the difference between pretended leadership and actual listening. They learned, therefore, a slightly different grammar of their partnership, one in which his left hand\u2019s insistence softened into a question and her back, which had long practiced polite obedience, took on a little more decision, and it occurred to her that this was a lesson about more than bones and sinew, though she did not say it because people become unkind when they are offered metaphors about themselves before they have asked.\n\nThe showcase that Giraud had promised became a date that sat up straight on the calendar, and the email with its unmatched fonts and its enthusiastic list of \u201copportunities for visibility\u201d did its best to be both a promise and a threat. She filled out the release forms with a pen that had survived the lives of five faculties, and tried not to be too amused by the phrase \u201cby participating you agree to be seen,\u201d which seemed to her both honest and indecent. Anne wrote to say she would be there with a needle and an opinion, and in the same breath asked, in her majestic way, if she might borrow \u00c9lise\u2019s kitchen on Sunday to make a jam that required the kind of patience none of her lovers could be trusted to demonstrate. \u201cI will pay with sugar and a counsel you will not take,\u201d Anne wrote, and \u00c9lise laughed in the empty room and sent back her address like a performance schedule. It occurred to her that one of the great luxuries of being an adult is deciding which fervent instructions to disobey.\n\nCamille brought both poems and a face that had discovered that ambition does not always look like a horse one can ride; sometimes it looks like a room that has not been aired. They sat with the pages and the invisible lamp they moved between them whenever they used words like tenderness and necessary, and a disagreement about whether brackets should be allowed to exist in a poem took on the contour of a debate about whether a person ought to narrate their own forgiveness while doing the forgiving. Camille, who had a mother with many sentences living inside her and a father who had become a parenthesis, argued for the brackets, and \u00c9lise argued for their absence while confessing to a private love of parentheses, and in the end they invented a compromise that was not really a compromise but an invitation to write two poems again. \u201cYou are exhausting,\u201d Camille declared with a smile that forecast a life of specific insistence, and \u00c9lise told her that exhaustion was simply the name for the feeling of having lived inside one\u2019s work for a while without opening a window, and that it could be survived with fruit and laughter.\n\nOne afternoon, after a lesson in which the subjunctive convinced several children that French was unfair for having invented a mood that punished people for dreaming aloud, she found herself at the cemetery without having planned it, which is often how one comes to see the dead when one intends only a longer walk. The rows of names did the quiet labor of reminding the living that other people have had days, and more than once her feet stopped and her eyes read someone else\u2019s age as if it were a price she might be willing to pay. Her mothers lay under a stone they had chosen together when the younger one was still convinced of a long career in laughter, and the older had insisted on something plain, because even her grief had been allergic to ostentation. She sat on the low wall and told them the news the way a child tells invisible friends a secret, not because she expected an answer but because the act itself made the air less empty. She told them about Paris in the voice she reserved for things that tried to be both miraculous and bureaucratic, she told them about the lab and the boy who had learned not to giggle at being led, she told them about Jules and his apology that had been short and sincere, and then she told them about the rent and how very grown she had felt handing over an envelope like a person in a film. The wind was industrious, moving low branches and small regrets, and when she stood she felt lighter in exactly the way one does when a bag has been taken off the shoulder and forgotten for half a block.\n\nThe interview for the showcase was scheduled for a Thursday night in a room that had been a canteen and now tried to be a studio with the help of three cheap lights and a young woman with a microphone that had opinions. The questions were the kind that want to be short answers and become long if you happen to be honest, and the cameraman, who had hair arranged like a decision, asked them to be more emotional and then less, and then to try something in which they felt \u201cconnected\u201d though not \u201cdependent,\u201d and she and Rafa\u00ebl exchanged the look of two people who have shared an absurdity before and agreed silently to behave. When it was her turn to speak alone, she said a sentence about the way movement had been the boat she had not known she had built, and another about how teaching sometimes felt like taking dictation from a group mind that did not know its own beauty, and when she began to say a third that involved the word salvation she stopped herself because she did not want to frighten the microphone. Rafa\u00ebl, in his turn, admitted to having learned tenderness from wood and wire, and said, with a gentle bravado, that a good lead is a conversation and a poor one an order, and \u00c9lise looked at him and did not say that she had been waiting to hear that from a man since she was the size of an adjective.\n\nOn Friday, Jules arrived with the girls again because they had discovered that a funicular is a machine that can be loved like a pet, and this time he brought their mother\u2014their mother by virtue of the children and the kitchen table, not because the universe had given her any paper to prove it\u2014who had been the cord around which his life had been braided for a decade. She was a woman with a surgical humor and an unreasonable kindness toward chairs, and she received \u00c9lise with a scrutiny that was affectionate and a little dangerous, as if she were measuring her not for a dress but for a future conversation that would include the word stubborn. Over coffees that behaved like citizens, they spoke about the stupid magnificence of cities, and about the school\u2019s decision to cut field trips, and then the woman took the girls to watch a street musician whose instrument accepted griefs for money, and Jules and \u00c9lise were left in a square of afternoon in which they could afford to finish a sentence. He told her he had lain awake the night before thinking about the line in Camille\u2019s poem about the jacket, because even though he did not know the girl he had recognized in it the look their father used to have when he came home from a day spent selling people the idea of certainty and could not find a place for his own uncertainty to sit. She told him she had dreamed of a room full of her mother\u2019s hair and that the dream had not been cruel, only insistent, and he put his hand on the table and she put hers over it and for a moment it was as if they had managed to be their own parents and forgive themselves for the hours they had not managed to save.\n\nThe dress behaved in rehearsal as if it had been raised well. Anne, possessed by a benevolent tyranny, pinned it into obedience with such efficiency that the garment seemed grateful, and she left \u00c9lise\u2019s kitchen smelling like sugar that had reconsidered its life and a citrus that had decided it could not go on unless it was boiled. They ate bread with a jam that tasted like a decision not to apologize, and Anne told stories about stages that had refused to behave and how one must be polite to a board even when it creaks insults, and she gave \u00c9lise a small pin in the shape of a star with one crooked point, saying in a voice that did not mind being theatrical that it had belonged to her grandmother who had danced once in Poland because a man in a hat had told her he could not promise to love her but could promise to watch with kindness. The star was not valuable and its crookedness made it look as if it had survived an argument, and \u00c9lise pinned it to the inside of the dress where only she would know it lived, because there are talismans one must wear close to skin and not advertise to fate.\n\nThe night of the showcase arrived with an edge, the way music halls collect weather around their doors. The Carr\u00e9 had decided to be generous, and backstage the seamstresses conducted their perennial debate about whether bias cuts were the invention of a genius or a saboteur, and several men made it their duty to count cables in different directions. There was a small mishap, because stages have their sense of humor, and twenty minutes before they were called a portion of the lights executed a meaningful flicker and then gave up, forcing a man with a calm moustache to become a hero with a ladder while someone else delivered a speech to the fuse box about perseverance. Anne padded about with her pins like a person charged with keeping planets in their orbits, and when the stage manager came to tell them that the lights could be persuaded to be faithful but not entirely obedient, they looked at each other and agreed in that quiet way that they would dance like people who have learned at last how to be looked at in the dark.\n\nThey were given a slot early, which meant the audience\u2019s attention was still thirsty and not yet sophisticated with expectations. The music came in clean and then disappeared once, as if embarrassed to be caught assisting, and the darkness in that moment was not complete but sufficient to make them more important to themselves, and in the half-light she could see the edge of the stage like a sentence that had been cut short and had to be guessed. He tightened the connection at her back by a shade, and she let her ribs listen to his breath, and together they made the adjustments that all intimacy requires when the room changes its mind about permission. The last turn, their friend and their treachery, arrived at exactly the right moment and accepted their offering of ankles and trust, and when the lights returned entirely at the end, as if apologizing for their earlier whim, they found the two of them in that posture just after the bow where one is both naked and armored, and the applause did not have the frantic stupidity of competition; it had instead the texture of relief, like water after salt.\n\nIn the quiet room afterward where the recorded interviews would be spliced into each other and uploaded to hungry places, a young woman from a local channel asked her what she would say to her younger self if she could go back and advise her before she decided to begin late. She said, carefully and then not careful at all, that she would tell the girl that lateness is a kind of style and that shame is a poor instructor, and that if you wait to be invited you will spend your life holding your breath in doorways, and the girl with the microphone made a noise of polite enthusiasm and then a real noise, the kind people make when an answer reminds them of a thing they have been pretending not to want. Later, when the video appeared in a corner of the internet that was not inhospitable, she watched herself in the brightness and felt both deadly earnest and ridiculous, and she decided to love herself in the clip with the same practiced generosity she extended to the children when their mouths forgot how to be brave.\n\nThe week after, a man from the municipal cultural center called with a question that sounded like an opportunity wearing comfortable shoes. Would she, he asked with the brisk humility of someone who has been told \u201cno\u201d very often, consider leading a short series of movement sessions for adults who had misplaced their bodies somewhere in the years between chores and catastrophe? There was not much money, there was never much money, but there was enough to buy peaches for a month and to pay for a pair of shoes that did not make the knees regret hope, and the classes would be on a Tuesday evening in a room that had once been used to teach circle dances and then used to store chairs and would now be pressed into service as mercy. She said yes because the part of her that makes lists nodded and because the part of her that lives in ankles clapped, and then she hung up and let herself be foolish in the hallway, weaving between the shadow of the coat rack and the washing machine with a move that had no name and did not need one.\n\nAt school, the movement laboratory discovered that children enjoy teaching more than being taught, and she spent a joyful session watching a boy instruct a girl in the art of not flinching when someone places a hand between your shoulder blades to tell you which way the music goes, a lesson that should be taught in every school by law. The librarian moved the gladiators to a higher shelf because a younger class had tried to use them as chess pieces and invented, in the process, a war between verbs and nouns that ended with the verb fleeing on a dinosaur, and he asked her if she wanted the trophy back and she told him to keep it hostage a little longer so that she might collect the pleasure of seeing it during passing moments when she needed to remember that brass can be a kind of kindness. Renaud was still in love with the idea of being of use, and began, spontaneously, to bring her small presents of competence\u2014a sharpened pencil at the exact time she lost her own, a photocopy that had collated itself, a cap on a pen that matched\u2014until she told him, with an affection that bordered on gratitude, that she could survive without being rescued so long as he continued to tell her stories in which he, by accident, became a hero in the medley of administrative incompetences.\n\nThere was, of course, a bill that wanted to be the antagonist in a story that did not require one, and on a Tuesday afternoon the envelope that arrived with the modest thud of bureaucracy demanded money for something she had not known she was using\u2014some line of internet that had been attached to something else, or a charge that had been explained in a tone that frightened her into agreement. She felt the old vertigo and sat on the edge of the bed to make the room sit down with her, then did the grown thing of calling and waiting and negotiating without crying, and in the silence between the hold music and the human voice she recited to herself the declaration Anne had made about old boards and the way one must be polite even to the things that ruin your heels. When a person finally answered, he turned out to be a boy who loved football and who admitted, after three minutes, that the fee was designed to discourage despair and could be removed if one remembered to ask, and she thanked him so sincerely that he laughed and told her she could call back any time to talk about chickens, which she decided not to analyze.\n\nOn a Thursday that tasted like metal, she watched the video of the showcase at her desk between classes, and a girl who was supposed to be finding the subjunctive instead found the clip and, seeing her teacher moving like someone with permission, put her hand to her mouth and asked, in a whisper that had disobedience and admiration in it, how one acquired such a back. \u201cBy carrying too many books and then deciding to carry none,\u201d she said, and the girl nodded as if this were practical. A parent wrote a polite message asking whether the club encouraged \u201cexpressiveness that might distract from examination rigor,\u201d and she wrote back that expressive people tend to survive examinations with their souls intact and that a child who can stand still when asked will not, in fact, ruin a classroom by discovering the metronome that lives in their ribs. The parent responded with a line about budgets and standards that had surely been copied from a publication, and \u00c9lise put the phone down and went to the lab and taught six children how to walk a line without looking at their feet.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the cultural center held a small orientation that involved pastries behaving like ambassadors, and she sat in a circle of folding chairs with a shy retired dancer who had a knee like an old door, a man who had come because he had been told by a doctor to \u201creconnect\u201d and had decided that the word, if not the act, appealed to him, a young woman whose hair was a protest and who wore anger like a borrowed coat, and two mothers who wanted to discover whether there was space beneath duty for breath. They began by sitting silently until someone laughed because silence in groups is offensive to the human appetite, and then she spoke about what the floor asked for from them and what it did not, and about what bravery looks like when no one is watching, and then they stood and took four steps and stopped and took two steps back, and in the disorder of the small moves she saw people being generous with their injuries and with their pride. At the end, the man with the knee asked if the exit would be painful, and she told him yes, but that the pain would teach them the way home, and he nodded as if he had been waiting for someone to make even one promise that was not an advertisement.\n\nThat evening, a rain came that thought itself more important than it was, and the city became glossy and melancholy in the way of things that have performed this trick too often and still get away with it. She and Rafa\u00ebl practiced the section they had abandoned years ago because it had humiliated them in front of a mirror, and this time the mirror, having watched them suffer other humiliations with grace, decided to be cordial. He told her about a cousin who had phoned from a job site in Toulouse where they needed men who could be trusted to find leaks that did not want to be found, and she heard in his voice the preparation for leaving that some men carry around like a toolkit. He did not ask her to tell him not to go; she did not tell him she would be angry if he stayed out of habit; they simply measured the space between his wrist and the idea of a new city, and then they danced the kind of practice that says we will survive this conversation later without a stage.\n\nOn Sunday, the old woman with the fuchsia backpack appeared like an appointment kept by fate, her bun tighter than her arguments, and insisted on taking \u00c9lise for a coffee she could not afford and for which she paid with a grand gesture that made the coins look like theater. She told \u00c9lise she had once had a pin that brought her luck until she lost it on the bus to Charpennes and that afterward everything in her life had continued as normal and yet a small door had remained closed for a long time because objects sometimes carry the permission that people refuse to give themselves. \u00c9lise told her about the crooked star and the woman who had bequeathed it, and the old woman, pleased as if twins had discovered each other in a shop, took her hand without warning and pressed her palm to the table and tapped once with her finger where the bell lived. \u201cIt is still ringing,\u201d she said in a tone that admitted an almost superstitious satisfaction, and \u00c9lise, surprised to find that this assessment comforted her, agreed.\n\nAt the end of the month, when the cultural center sent a poster with her name in a font that had not been made to flatter the poor and the brave, she stuck it to her refrigerator with a magnet shaped like a pear and felt, for a moment, the kind of pride that does not brag because it is too busy preparing the chairs. She had the laboratory on Mondays, the adults on Tuesdays, her own practice on Fridays because Wednesday and Thursday belonged to being tired, and on Saturdays the invigilations would come like slow trains, and she could see a season arranged not like a trap but like a scaffolding. In the spaces left between, there were children who asked if the future could be written in a tense they liked, and a brother who was learning how to owe and be owed affection without turning that into mathematics, and a man who might go to Toulouse and whose wrist had healed sufficiently for him to be negligent of it again, and a city that persisted in being a place where women could walk at night with a small fear and a small joy and arrive home with both.\n\nWhen sleep was slow to find her, she lay on her back and let her ankles tell the story of the day to her knees while the radiator rehearsed its jokes, and she thought about the problem of deserving and the solution of persistence, and about how sometimes a life feels like a hall that refuses your shoes and then, by way of some administrative error or grace, admits you with an apology and a chair. She did not make plans bigger than a month because everything larger than that has always felt like hubris and budget, but she let herself picture a year in which the lab survived inspection and the adults laughed at their own seriousness and she bought lemons without looking at their price, and in which she allowed herself to imagine that the bell at her sternum would continue to ring not with the clang of alarms but with the low, friendly insistence of a town clock that knows everyone\u2019s names. Outside, a bus sighed and a woman laughed at a joke the night had told her, and the sound slid in through the small opening in the window and made a place for itself on the shelf beside the gladiators, and she slept with her hand on the crooked star through the thin fabric as if she were a girl who had smuggled home a secret and intended, stubbornly, to keep it.",

                              "content": "Chapter 8\n\nWinter did not ask permission; it clamped itself over the city with the quiet certainty of a lid finding its pot, and the Sa\u00f4ne took on that particular fatigue that makes water look like metal. In the mornings, the damp became less tender, choosing instead to be factual; her scarf learned a new tightness and the fennel behind the butcher turned suddenly medicinal, as if it had been hired for its virtues. The bell at her sternum did not stop; it lowered its note until it could be felt in the bones of her wrists when she lifted her mug. On a Tuesday that had more gray than hours, Rafa\u00ebl told her in the studio with his hands at his pockets as if he had been instructed to behave himself that the job in Toulouse had turned from rumor to train ticket. He spoke with that deliberate cheerfulness some men build when they have dragged a decision across every room in their heads, and she listened with the particular kind of attention she reserves for people she is determined not to make into enemies. \u201cSix weeks,\u201d he said, and the number was both small and unbearable. They considered, in the way dancers measure distances without moving, how far six weeks is for a body that is used to being found by the same palm between the shoulder blades, and then they began to talk about times and trains, and who would take care of the plants in his kitchen, and whether he should try the place with the inexpensive rooms near the station or accept his cousin\u2019s offer of a couch and a constant argument.\n\nAt the coll\u00e8ge, the laboratory acquired a visitor\u2019s chair and a visitor to sit in it, because the headmaster had mentioned the word \u201coversight\u201d in a meeting and the word had grown fruit. The woman from the committee wore a navy dress that had been asked to look impartial and a scarf that had been asked to look like a personality, and she smiled with a firmness that dared you to disappoint her. \u00c9lise had put away her metaphors and lined up her verbs; she plastered the walls with the language of outcomes, and on the board drew the skeleton of her hour so that a person who mistrusted the art might at least appreciate the architecture. At the beginning, the children were loud and then not; Farid refused to remove his shoes in a way that was dignified rather than defensive, and the older girl, whose defiance had become a garment she wore with increasing accuracy, took the boy\u2019s hand in the eyes-closed walk and led him with such fierce delicacy that the committee scarf drooped. Halfway through, while they practiced the scandal of standing still and feeling where their feet were without naming it confession, the woman\u2019s pen stopped moving as if someone had pressed a finger to its mouth. In the little debriefing that followed, the visitor said she had expected \u201cmovement\u201d to be more exhausting and less quiet, and \u00c9lise, resisting the invitation to witty cruelty, spoke instead about how a body is a city of negotiations and that teaching a child to read their own signals reduces the need to shout later. The next day, an email arrived with the committee\u2019s boiled language approving a pilot extension, and Renaud pinned it to the noticeboard with a flourish as if it were the declaration of a small republic, adding a doodle of a pair of feet in the margin that made the headmaster wince and then pretend not to have seen.\n\nThe adults on Tuesday evenings brought with them the smell of their days, which were varied and specific\u2014metal and flour and antiseptic and the ghost of cigarettes that had not, in fact, been smoked. The young woman with protest for hair stood at the edge as if daring the floor to humiliate her personally, and when she was asked simply to walk she burst into a laugh that was too bright to be a laugh. They did not coo at her, because pity is nothing but a mirror held too close; instead, they let her walk badly until her shoulders felt the indecency of carrying so much, and then she allowed, in a tiny surrender that felt like a secret, to be led for three steps by the retired dancer with the knee as if the old woman\u2019s years could be borrowed for a minute like a cardigan against a draft. After class, the man ordered by a doctor to reconnect stayed to wash the cups as if paying reparations to the sink, and told her, without looking up, that his wife had wanted to learn tango and then had instead learned how to die, and he wanted to know if a person who had never held a body properly could still earn the right to try. She answered that permission is not a prize awarded for excellence but a fact one asserts and honors, and that the floor had no memory of their previous failures, and he nodded with that brittle gratitude of people who have built whole afternoons on the hope that someone will not scold them.\n\nCamille arrived one morning with eyes that had decided to be new. She said she had shown the poem to her mother and to her father separately and that in between the two showings she had written another poem that had no jacket in it at all, and that afterwards she had vomited because the body sometimes refuses to be interrupted while it is becoming. There was a small contest at the municipal library with a glass prize that made books look like a religion, and Camille had put her name down with an indifference that betrayed her blood. They discussed nerves as an animal one can feed wisely; they practiced reading the lines aloud at different temperatures, and \u00c9lise tried to assume the expression that would make the girl believe in her own mouth. On the day of the reading, the child stood on a low platform with a potted fern that resembled a minor judge and said the line about the jacket in a voice that did not apologize for its audacity, and a woman in the third row who had come primarily to argue with the prizes dabbed her eyes and later pretended the air had been dusty. Camille did not win; she came second to a boy who had written a beautiful lie about a city he had never visited, and on the way out she whispered to \u00c9lise that even not winning had felt good in her throat.\n\nThey did the practical work of departure without naming it grief. He brought the suitcase to her apartment one evening because its wheels were better on her stairs than his, and because handing a person weight is a way of asking them to bless you without saying the word. He gave her a key that did not belong to him but to a cabinet in the studio where he kept a hoard of things people who are always mending must hoard\u2014electrical tape and bandages and a string that believed itself useful\u2014and told her to take whatever she needed without asking because leaving sometimes requires you to pretend that generosity is a system. On the platform, the train made that show of being coy before opening its mouth to accept him; he kissed her once on each cheek and once in the middle of the air, and then he put his forehead to hers in a gesture that would have made a romance out of them if it had belonged to different people. \u201cI will send you a picture of every leak,\u201d he said, and she said she would send him a picture of her ankle whenever it behaved itself, and then they laughed too loudly because there was water very near the rim of both of them and anyone can see it when the surface trembles. When the train did its trick of leaving while making you believe you were the one who moved, she felt a single foolish tear make an expedition down her nose and onto her lip, and she licked it away with the mindless practicality of a person who has decided to survive.\n\nAlone on the floor, the mirror became less forgiving and more faithful. Without the specific conversation of his hand asking and her back answering, she found that the room had become populated by pasts\u2014errors she had catalogued and resentments she had managed like pot plants. She practiced the first six bars with the minimal civility of a person doing their duty and found herself stalled at the place where the turn had always been a problem, as if problems have their own gravity. There is a comedy in practicing with absence; she could feel the ghost of his palm and almost turn into it, and then she had to teach her muscles not to anticipate charity. The crooked star pressed against her skin under the ordinary shirt like a punctuation mark reminding a sentence of its job; she moved and the star moved and a friendship formed between them that had nothing to do with belief and everything to do with continuity. After an hour, when the body is done pretending it will not cooperate, when the knees have filed their complaints and been heard, she made the turn alone with the precision of a woman placing a cup on a saucer in a room where the child sleeps, and the relief was so unreasonable that she leaned her forehead for a second against the cold mirror and thanked the stupid wall for its attention.\n\nIn the small bureaucratic theater of her life, a pleasing farce occurred: the grant came through. It arrived with an email that confessed itself unexpectedly enthusiastic and a PDF that had been saved too many times with different names, and it promised an amount that did not suggest wealth but did suggest persistence might yet be rewarded in this century. She took the news to the librarian because some men can be trusted with joy, and he made her a coffee that did not offend her tongue and said he had always suspected committees were capable of mercy if they were presented with the right adjectives. Renaud threw an arm in the air and declared himself Treasurer of Something, and they laughed because words have always been richer than budgets. She walked home and bought lemons without her breath changing and allowed herself, in so small a decadence it felt almost like a trick, to add a bunch of parsley to the basket because one should teach the refrigerator that color is not an emergency. That evening she wrote to Anne that they ought to waste sugar again, and Anne replied with three ideas and an insult about a critic that promised an afternoon of pleasure.\n\nBecause the universe enjoys both symmetry and mischief, she lost the star. It was a mean, quick loss; she had pinned it as always to the inside of her practice shirt and then, after a class in which the boys had discovered the word \u201csuspension\u201d and made it into a physical comedy she had admired against her will, she found her fingers touching only cotton. The panic was not dignified; she searched the bag and the floor and the cruel gap between bench and wall where small objects go to become historical. She retraced her steps through the studio and then to the tram and then to her kitchen, where she looked in the sink because one always looks in the sink, as if the metal might confess to harboring a saint. She went to bed with that hollow between ribs that arrives when a thing you have chosen to believe in goes out without leaving a note, and in the morning she made herself put on her shoes without ceremony and went down to the landlady\u2019s, because courage sometimes looks like doing the day\u2019s stupid things while remembering to say good morning. In the afternoon, while hanging a shirt to dry, she found the star clinging to the inside seam with the ridiculous tenacity of a flea, and she laughed so loudly that the neighbor\u2019s boy peeked through the stair rail to confirm she was alone. She pinned it back with a ferocity that would have frightened a larger jewel, and she scolded it because scolding amulets is foolish and unresisted, and she wore it for the rest of the day even while teaching about prepositions, a fact of which the children were cheerfully ignorant and which improved her mood to an indecent degree.\n\nRenaud, who had fallen in love with competence and then with an opera singer, fell out of love with ease not at all. He arrived one morning in a tie that had not been bullied into cleverness and the eyes of a man who had received a sentence without a verb. Anne had decided that the part of her life in which he had been central must now be remodeled without him, and in the staff room he wavered between eulogy and joke with that dangerous charm people cling to when their grief is new and frightened. She made him tea that tasted of the alphabet and sat with him while he invented versions of himself he might become\u2014ascetic, lothario, beekeeper\u2014and when he had finished she suggested librarian as a temporary vocation and movement assistant as a permanent one. He said the second was absurd and then, to her mild surprise, changed his mind halfway to the bin to throw away the tea bag, because watching children tell the truth with their shoulders had done something to the part of him that usually performed competence until it became a mask. Later that week, he appeared at her lab with a playlist that did not apologize for existing and an offer to count, and she allowed him to, and the numbers he said aloud had a steadiness that made the children taller.\n\nThe first snow came mid-lesson like a rumor that turned out to be exact. Someone shrieked the way people do when the air gives them an excuse, and they all went to the window as if it had been written in the curriculum. The flakes were not serious; they were the scouts of an army that might or might not be interested in laying siege to the city, and the courtyard responded by becoming briefly very handsome. She looked at the headmaster through the glass of his office door and he looked back at her and made the small face that principals make when asked for permission to break a rule that is not meant to protect anything important. \u201cFive minutes,\u201d he said, as if the number could contain joy, and she took them all outside and made them walk in a line along the edge of the gritted path with exaggerated slowness while their boots wrote a sentence the snow half-read. The girl with the dangerous shoulders declared that snow itself was a kind of silence that wanted to be listened to, and Farid announced that he had decided to remove his shoes when he felt like it and not a second before, and she told them to breathe because nothing improves an afternoon more cheaply than breathing together in cold air.\n\nAt night, when the world goes quiet over debts and dinners, Toulouse came to her telephone, and the phone lit her face the way all lonely cities resemble each other. He called from a room with a curtain that no one had ever meant to buy, and in the square of the screen his smile did its best to be sure of itself. He showed her a blister on a finger that had been bitten by a wire with opinions, and a sandwich so inadequate it had begun to apologize in advance, and an apartment block across the courtyard where a couple argued so patiently it made him want to applaud. Sometimes they spoke with scarecrow lightness, and sometimes they allowed the thread to carry quiet over hundreds of kilometers without insisting on filling it, and then she would walk with the phone pressed to her ear to her window, and he would listen to the sound of her radiator\u2019s arrogance as if it were proof that he would be permitted to come back. The first Sunday, he sent a photograph of a leak that had given up its location with theatrical reluctance, annotated with arrows and a drawing of a fish, and she replied with a video of her ankle behaving itself in a circle and the star lying on her palm like an accomplice. They hung up when the connection began to fragment his vowels into birds, and afterwards she stood with her face close to the cold of the window until the city gave her back to herself.\n\nThere were days when the bell at her sternum rang so low she worried she\u2019d mistaken it for a dull ache; there were days it chimed at a pitch that made the glass on the shelf hum along, which is a ridiculous thing to say out loud and entirely true. The cultural center\u2019s posters appeared in the world and she saw her own name next to words like \u201ccommunity\u201d and \u201cembodiment,\u201d and she felt both flattered and hunted. An old man came to class wearing a suit because the idea of exercise offended him and left wearing a sweater because the idea had apologized and then been permitted to enter; a woman confessed to having danced at weddings only behind pillars and was witnessed out in the open by strangers who did not make a joke of her. After one such class, the protest-haired girl approached and asked what to do when she looked at herself and hated the arrangement of things in an almost professional way, and \u00c9lise told her to make the mirror work for its wage and to stand so close to the glass it could not find all of her at once, and that in the end a person must decide who is the customer in that transaction. They laughed, and the girl tried, and afterward she wrote a message that said only \u201cI am still here,\u201d which was either nothing or the thing itself.\n\nA small embarrassment went round the staff room when a parent complained that the laboratory had resulted in their child\u2019s unusual determination to walk too slowly in supermarkets, as if the aisles had become an audience. The headmaster forwarded the message with a subject line scaffolding\u2014concern, which made her fond of him because everyone deserves a little theater in their caution. She wrote back to the parent with all the charm she could afford that there were worse rebellions than making the world wait for a person who was learning to take up their own time, and the parent replied, unexpectedly, that the boy had started making tea and that perhaps the connection was not coincidental. Renaud made a poster for the lab that featured a drawing of feet reading a book, and he hung it under a crooked notice about detentions that had remained crooked for such a long time that the crookedness had become part of the aesthetic. She made him straighten it because there are rules one must obey even when one is busy inventing others.\n\nOn a Thursday near the end of term, when everyone is too tired to pretend they like each other and therefore can be liked, she found herself in the park under the chestnuts just before evening, because she had taken the long way home in order to prove she did not belong entirely to the grids of the day. She watched a boy teach his father how to throw a paper plane with the correct sticking-out tongue, and a woman argue with a dog about mud as if the animal understood the politesse of flooring, and she thought about the year that had been too much of everything and somehow also parsimonious with miracles. The star lay obediently against her sternum; the gladiators had collected a thin layer of dust in the staff room, which made them look older and therefore more credible; the lab had a budget that would not survive a hungry committee but might survive careful stapling; Camille had a new poem that refused to behave and might become a life. When she got home, she found a package under the door from Anne containing two jars of jam labeled with handwriting that had a bias toward melodrama\u2014one read Winter Citrus for Courage, the other read Bitter Peel for Truth\u2014and a note that said, simply, eat the second when you are infuriated by the first.\n\nThat night the dream arrived again, with the hall and the floor that tolerated only her feet, but this time the chairs were occupied by her living\u2014the librarian, Renaud, the girl with the protest hair, the old woman with the fuchsia backpack, the headmaster pretending not to be moved, Jules with a child on each knee, Anne with her pins like medals, and, in a deep shadow where one is not expected to identify one\u2019s devils, her mother, who looked neither approving nor discouraging but attentive in a way that felt more like friendship than review. She woke in the place just before her clock had been asked to perform its small act of heroism, and lay with the knowledge that sleep had not betrayed her by telling her unuseful truths. The radiator argued with itself without taking sides; the city outside made its quiet inventory of lamps and cats and buses; her body rehearsed the mild ache of being a person who has used it. She put her hand to her sternum, felt the bell\u2019s long note, and considered, briefly and then persistently, that perhaps the door she had spent her life tapping at had not been opened by someone else but by her knuckles having knocked a groove into it at last. She got up because mornings hold their own kind of ceremony, and because tea does not make itself, and because there would be children to teach to walk slower and a man to call in another city where the curtains still had not chosen to be beautiful, and because cost and joy had their account to reconcile in the ledger she carried around like a private book of hours.",

                              "content": "Chapter 10\n\nFebruary had a way of arranging itself like a badly folded map, all creases in the wrong directions, and she walked through it with the tolerant irritation one reserves for furniture that cannot be moved. The river took on the posture of a patient in a waiting room, determined to appear untroubled, and the air acquired that taste of wet keys that winter dispenses when it wants to remind you who is in charge of locks. She tied her scarf with the firmness of someone closing an argument and counted, without admitting it to herself, the mornings until the first daffodil would be reckless on the quai. The bell at her sternum continued its plain work, so steady now that she could measure the day by its hum, and she had the absurd thought that if she put her ear against the window she would hear the city ring back.\n\nThe laboratory had become a country with customs and, inevitably, smuggling. A boy tried to bring swagger across the border and had it confiscated at the door but, uninspected, kindness slipped through in his pockets; a girl attempted, unsuccessfully, to hide her need for applause inside disdain, and another girl spotted it and held it up to the light like a jewel in a pawnshop. On the third Monday, they attempted the technique of leaving space between steps not as negligence but as offer, and it turned into a minor theology when Farid, who had finally taken off his shoes in a silent ceremony that involved knotting his laces with dignity and placing them side by side as if they were friends, declared that the empty parts were the best because you could sit down inside them without anyone seeing. She wanted to clap and did not, because you must not reward children for discovering something they cannot yet protect; instead she taught them the practical trick of counting silence as if it were a note. The committee lady returned, scarf subdued, and stayed longer than her schedule would have wished, her pen making more pauses than words.\n\nCamille arrived one morning with a bruise under her sleeve that was not a bruise but a blue ink stain from a pen that had exploded while she was writing in bed, and her face had that satisfied exhaustion of someone who has argued with themselves and not lost. She produced a poem that refused to end where she had meant it to, and they laughed over its insubordination and agreed to let it have the last word for a while. When the municipal library published the list of finalists for the glass prize, Camille\u2019s name had mischief in its vowels, and her mother sent a message to say she would attend with a stoic coat and a resolve not to say anything injurious about metaphors in public. The reading itself was lit with that inexpensive brightness that makes everyone look briefly like someone else, and Camille\u2019s voice had found the height at which it could speak without arousing the suspicion of the ceiling. She did not win, which was correct because winning would have made her insufferable for a fortnight, but afterward a woman with hair like punctuation came and told her she had done something honest to an afternoon, and the girl measured the sentence as if it were fabric she could use later.\n\nToulouse tattooed itself into Rafa\u00ebl\u2019s messages with the cheap ink of temporary lodgings\u2014curtains the color of disappointment, a kettle that took offense if filled past its line, a neighbor who sang softly and could not carry a tune even through a thin wall. He called from streets with names that had opinions, and once from a bar where a man told a joke about electricity that could not be translated without being killed. The job, of course, tried to grow; it insisted on an extra two weeks in a tone of voice the foreman called unavoidable and that reminded her of the phrase we have no choice used politely as an instrument. He rehearsed leaving again without complaint, and she practiced the art of not making a friend into a martyr by praising his absence too eloquently. When he sent a photograph of his wrist healed to the color of a lesson learned, she replied with a photograph of the crooked star resting on her sternum like a punctuation mark that had decided not to move, and he texted back a small constellation made of dots and dashes and a fish because there are love languages that are not languages and ought not to be named.\n\nThere are, inside schools, small storms that never make the news, and one gathered in the staff room over paper cups and the smell of coffee that was trying to forgive itself. A parent wrote to the committee to say the laboratory had emboldened her child to sway in the aisle of the supermarket while choosing yogurt, which she found extravagant and, perhaps, communist. The headmaster, who had learned from years of bats in attics that fear can climb through any crack, forwarded the message with a sigh that had practiced being dignified. \u00c9lise drafted a reply that used words like proprioception and attention economy and then deleted it because both words would turn into weapons when repeated in kitchens and on buses, and instead wrote that the boy would grow up into a person who could stand in a line without resenting the stranger in front of him, and that the country would be better for it. The parent, unexpectedly, responded that he had, in fact, helped an old woman reach the top shelf where the jam lived, and that perhaps this was what they were paying for after all, and she printed the missile and pinned it under the gladiators because not all victories have trumpets and most deserve shelves.\n\nA small celebration in late afternoon was arranged by accident when the librarian produced a pan of something that had once been cake and now had ambitions to be history, and Renaud arrived with a bottle of apple juice that he insisted was festive and which tasted like an orchard with anxieties. They ate and called it a committee meeting and laughed the way people laugh when they have believed a thing and been rewarded enough to make superstition reasonable. Renaud wore a new tie with tiny bicycles that made him look as if he had joined an eccentric government, and he had begun to help with the lab in a way that made her proud of him, not because he was competent, which he had always been in front of adults, but because his counting had adopted mercy as one of its digits. Anne sent a message to both of them saying she had been offered a role that required her to sing in a dress the color of suspicion and that she had accepted not for the dress but for a scene in which she would be permitted to make a gentleman cry, and he wrote back with seven hearts and a lemon, and after a pause she sent him a photograph of the stage lights like coins thrown in a fountain, and the three of them sat in different rooms being properly fond of one another without requiring proof.\n\nIn the city, weather found an excuse to flex, and a snow decided to matter. It arrived not with scouts but with infantry, fat flakes marching with pomp into the peripheries of plans, and by dark the streets had that purposeful hush that suggests conspiracies of good behavior. The electricity considered its options and chose, for a few hours, to be absent in several neighborhoods, and the corridor in her building filled with candlelight that made everyone look like apparitions summoned by the love lives of furniture. The elevator, which had never been reliable enough to become loved, surrendered with a sigh and trapped a young man on his way to a second date, and the neighbor\u2019s boy, solemn with role, went and fetched Madame Hanriot, who had a key that was not universal but had learned to pretend. People spoke in the tone reserved for recipes and disasters; someone discovered that the stairwell had excellent acoustics, and someone else, without permission but with tact, began to hum a tune that aspired to be a lullaby. The old woman with the fuchsia backpack arrived with a thermos of something medicinal and hopeful, and before anyone could stop them \u00c9lise and the boy were showing an impromptu line of neighbors how to walk silently down a flight in the dark without fearing their ankles. There, in the stairwell that had spent years being merely a place to not linger, a small dance formed\u2014a soft exchange of weight and trust, a mother entrusting a toddler to the banister and being rewarded, a teenager allowed to lead a grandfather without irony. When the lights returned with their blare and apology, no one cheered; they simply looked at each other with that embarrassed gratitude that follows unjustified kindness, and the young man went to his second date smelling faintly of wax and pancakes and having learned that an elevator can be an origin story.\n\nA letter with an eagle printed in blue arrived from the municipal cultural office with the good arrogance of paper that has been handled by many desks, and it informed her, with blameless formulations, that the grant money would be released in two parts, one now and one after counts had been counted, and that she was to spend some of it on something the letter called documentation. She bought a notebook the size of a sandwich and a camera that had been loved by someone else and approved of recording people who had not asked for it. She wrote down the names of songs they did not use and the moments children laughed because someone had tripped on a silence, and she took pictures of shoes lined up like sheep at the edge of a hill and of the corner of the studio where dust performed its quiet occupation. She kept the receipts because the future loves paper, and one afternoon she allowed herself to buy a secondhand coat lined with a fake fur that felt like the kindness of strangers, and she wore it to the market like a person who has admitted winter is not a rumor and has decided to look it in the eye.\n\nToulouse sent him home for a weekend the way long distances sometimes grant parole for good behavior. He arrived with the damp of a different city on his cuffs and a sleep in his eyes that belonged to trains, and in the studio he stood for a minute as if asking the room to remember him. They did not attempt the reckless parts immediately; they walked like people sanely grateful for two legs, then counted without counting because their mouths had missed the numbers, and then marked the turn with that near-religious caution dancers employ around pivots, as if the earth\u2019s patience were not infinite after all. He smelled of metal and sandwiches; she smelled of chalk and ink; they smelled, together, of a place that can be returned to without apology. After an hour, as if obeying a calendar neither had consulted, they put the music on and did the thing their bodies have been instructed to do by months of instruction, and it was messy like happiness and accurate like habit, and when it ended he was laughing and she was not, and then she laughed because the alternative would have involved something too big for an ordinary afternoon.\n\nHe had a new habit of putting his hand on the rail as they walked down the studio steps, as if his wrists were still tender and gravity had become opinionated. She noticed and did not mention it; he noticed that she noticed and did not tell his hands to behave. Over a beer that pretended to be bread, they spoke about the job and the offer of its extension and how a city is always willing to keep you if you prove yourself willing to be lonely there. He asked about the lab and she told him a story about Farid and socks that was not interesting on paper and made him put his head down on his arm and breathe as if rescued. They did not discuss what they were to one another because the table was too small for that kind of furniture and because, more importantly, they had not been able to dance for weeks and no sentence could be trusted not to sabotage that fact. When she walked him back to the train, he carried the suitcase between them with one hand and let the other brush her shoulder high, a touch that had no right to be as serious as it felt. He promised to send a photograph of the first plane trees when they grew foolish at the canal, and she promised to send the sound of her radiator when it began again its spring cluck, and neither commented on how slowly a platform releases a body once a train has left.\n\nThe showcase videos did their rounds and landed, like resigned pigeons, on a page that the students found with the ruthless efficiency of youth. One by one they presented her with her own face between classes like a bouquet with thorns; she accepted it each time with the grin of a woman who has been caught out performing devotion in the open, and fought the urge to apologize for earnestness in a thin sweater. A parent stopped her in the street to say her daughter had begun to walk at home with a small dignity that did not match the family\u2019s furniture, and \u00c9lise nodded and pretended to have this effect all the time. Another parent, this one the kind who makes enemies of ideas before meeting them, sent a message demanding to know exactly how stillness could possibly prepare a child for life, and she responded gently that standing with accuracy is the foundation of almost every useful rebellion she had ever seen, and then she closed her phone and went to the studio and practiced not thinking about proof.\n\nJules sent a photograph of the girls attacking a snowman with political grievances, and beneath it a sentence saying that he had been offered more hours at the bureau in exchange for his weekends, which he did not want to give up because those were the days when he believed in parks and small museums and the act of showing little people how to make soup. She wrote back that money is a liar and that there are values other than rent, then appended, because she is not an idiot, a recipe for a soup that uses potatoes and pride in equal measure and costs less than missing a Saturday. He called that night and they argued the way people argue when money has placed a hand on their shoulders without asking, efficient and unkind and then repentant, and they ended with the sibling truce of insulting each other\u2019s competence and the promise of tea. After, she stood in the kitchen with the coat folded over a chair like a patient animal and stared at the lemons, which had taken on for the moment the look of witnesses.\n\nAt the end of the month, the cultural center staged an end-of-winter gathering of all the strange classes it housed\u2014pottery and pies and Portuguese, a choir with more ambition than pitch, a knitting circle whose members could have intimidated armies. They took to the hall with their shy ferocities, and in a pause between a gavotte and a speech that bullied the word community into doing too much work, she led her adults in a short walk across a floor that had been polished by earnestness. The protest-haired girl did not protest; the retired dancer\u2019s knee performed with the weightless vanity of an old star; the man who had been ordered to reconnect held out his hands with the self-forgiveness of someone at last prepared to drop a weapon. A boy from the pottery class clapped with alarming sincerity, and someone yelled bravo with enough accent to make it a gift. Afterwards, in the crush of people behaving responsibly toward pastries, a woman with a face like a solved mystery told \u00c9lise she had been watching from the door because she was not ready to belong to anything yet, and that watching had made her ribcage less a cage and more an instrument. The phrase was a clich\u00e9 and a miracle. They stood there for a minute breathing like new friends until a tray demanded attention, and then they allowed real life back in.\n\nMarch opened the window by half an inch and dared everyone to be optimistic. The rain changed its handwriting; the butcher\u2019s fennel gave up medicine and returned to mischief; the river decided to resume gossip. She woke one morning to a light that had made its mind up about the future and a message from Toulouse that contained only a photograph of a plane tree doing its obscene green, and she laughed aloud because vulgarity can be moral in moderate quantities. The headmaster sent word that the committee had granted the lab enough money to last through spring provided she supplied testimonials, and she spent an evening calling parents to ask for sentences that did not sound like they had been composed beneath a threatening lamp. The answers came like gifts left on doorsteps\u2014my son is gentler with doors now, my daughter corrected her grandfather\u2019s posture in the queue for croissants, my child breathes as if her own body is a place and not an enemy\u2014and she wrote them down without polishing, because the truth does not need cologne.\n\nOn a Thursday that smelled of new mud, the old woman with the fuchsia backpack invited her to a dance she described as respectable only from a distance. It was one of those Sunday afternoons in a gymnasium hired by people who believe they can charm a linoleum floor, and they could, mostly, because they had learned to bring their own light under their cardigans. The music was both too loud and not loud enough; the men shook hands with their nerves while the women held their chins with the practiced ease of queens of small countries; there was a raffle featuring a ham. \u00c9lise danced with three strangers who were all portions of a man she might once have thought she wanted\u2014gentle, clumsy, certain\u2014and with one woman who offered to lead and did so with an elegance that made her bones applaud. Between numbers she stood with the old woman and watched the couples go by and learned a taxonomy of joy that had nothing to do with youth and everything to do with permission. On their way out, they crossed the car park between puddles that had memorized the boots of the city, and the old woman said that of all the immodest things human beings insist on doing, learning with the body in public is the one she respects most, and \u00c9lise tucked the sentence under her tongue for later like a sugar.\n\nThe studio, when not borrowed by revolving classes, belonged to her in a way that felt almost liturgical. Alone now in the afternoons that could be spared, she arranged the chairs along the wall as if seating donors at a banquet, set the metronome to a compromise, and walked the phrase that had eluded her for a year with the tender patience of someone coaxing a cat from beneath a bed. Without him there to correct and be corrected, she discovered corners she had not known the room possessed. There is a laurel one can rest under that grows even in the absence of victory\u2014you have come back, it says, which is the point\u2014and she accepted its shade without writing a speech about it. Once, in the middle of a turn that had always required an apology, she felt the star press insistently against her sternum right at the moment when her foot would choose, and the choice was sudden and obvious and exactly correct; she laughed alone in the room and bowed to nobody for having decided to remain alive and to perform that aliveness in an unfashionable, inefficient, undignified way.\n\nIn the late afternoons after the lab, the courtyard filled with the kind of arguments that restore faith in the populace\u2014four children disagreeing about the ethics of cutting in line for the water fountain with the vocabulary of a parliament and the volume control of seagulls. She walked home slower because there is a kind of gratitude that demands dawdling, and on the bridge she encountered the headmaster practicing his own dawdle, hands behind his back in the posture of a man examining policy through the lens of birds. He thanked her, with more economy than usual, for the sentences parents had sent, and confessed, as if to a crime, that he had tried standing still for one minute the night before between the refrigerator and the sink and had found the activity shocking. She told him he could start a movement, and he said he had started a movement when he chose a life that contained detention slips, and they laughed with the rare ease of colleagues who have, for an afternoon, misplaced their weariness.\n\nRafa\u00ebl returned for good on a day that pretended not to be triumphant. He came with two bags and an extra line near his left eye that had not been there before and made him look more like himself. The city received him with a shrug that functioned as welcome; the studio, with its indifferent floor and its faithful mirrors, offered him no discount, which was also a form of love. They practiced the piece and then did not, abandoning it for the foolishness of a rhythm neither would ever perform in public because it required too much forgetting. In the pause between tracks, he said there was an offer to go back in summer to a site that promised to pay and to break and asked, in a tone that the bell in her recognized as fear disguised as courtesy, whether she thought he should. She answered with the cruelty of honesty that she did not intend to be cruel, telling him she wanted him here and that she would applaud him if he left, and that for the first time in her entire life she was able to imagine asking someone to stay without confusing the request with a threat, and he listened with the stillness of a man standing under weather and deciding whether it is rain or baptism. They did not solve it; they danced again instead, which is not a solution but is a system, and it kept them from saying the ugly sentences later disguised as noble.\n\nOn the way home that night, the tram made an unplanned halt between stations where the city is all weeds and confessions, and for five minutes a car of strangers did the revolution of accepting each other. A woman removed a paper star from her coat and handed it to a child who had been patient; a man looked up from his phone with the expression of someone realizing his own face is not so bad; two teenagers performed the small tender cruelty of pretending not to be in love. She stood holding the pole and felt the weird mercy of a pause you did not request and could not lengthen, and when the tram started again the city returned to its ungenerous grace and she tagged along as if invited.\n\nAt home, the crooked star lay cooling against her sternum and the gladiators kept their watch over the plant that refused to be a tree but insisted upon hope. She set the new notebook on the table with its pages that looked like certainty and wrote down nothing for a while, letting the pen rest its weight on the paper the way a foot finds the floor and waits for it to respond. The bell at her sternum sounded low and friendly, an old clock that would, she suspected, continue to ring even if the city went briefly mad with spring and then with disappointment. She opened the window, listened to the water dumpsters gossip in the alley, and put on a record that made the kitchen behave like a considerate partner. It was not a victory night or a debt night; it was simply a continuing, and she stood in it the way one stands in a shower that takes a moment to decide who it belongs to and then, benevolently, concedes.",
