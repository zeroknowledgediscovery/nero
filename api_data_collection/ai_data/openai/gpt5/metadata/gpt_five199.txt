The first time Mason Kline said the word hippo aloud in the studio, everyone laughed because they thought it was a bit, a thing to keep viewers hanging between an advertisement for flooring and the local weather. He said it into the foam top of the mic, careful with the p’s. “Hippopotamus,” he said again, slower, and drew a childish shape in the air with his finger as if the animal could be summoned by a cartoon outline. They cut to a pre-recorded reel of a breakfast diner owner flipping pancakes in slow motion while Mason kept drawing his imaginary animal in the space between his face and the camera. Dina, his producer, slid into his peripheral vision and sliced her finger across her throat to tell him to stop. He smiled at the lens, the smile his mother called charming and his sister called imported. He did not stop thinking about the word.

Paramus, if you don’t know it the way he did, doesn’t love to be televised. It’s malls and family lawns and minivans and people who wave in a tight circle with their hand instead of actually committing to a wave. But “Morning Paramus” had three solid advertisers and a stealthy audience that texted Dina after each broadcast with suggestions and complaints about the color of Mason’s tie. He would get out of his car in the lot behind the low brick building where the show lived, and a man from the deli next door would say, “Saw you last week, Kline, you said gran-nular instead of granular,” and pat him on the shoulder as if he had saved the county.

The hippo was not a bit. Mason didn’t know that at first. He knew he had trouble sleeping in April because everything was breathing new green, violent color, and his apartment still smelled like reporter notebooks, burnt coffee, and onion bagel. He knew he kept waking with images of a body like a boulder lifting from muddy water. In his dreams the animal spooled out of the river like a moon. When he sat up and tapped his phone to check the time, the after-image stayed behind his eyes. He’d go back to sleep saying, “hippo, hippo, hippo” the way a camp counselor might say “calm down” to children, and somewhere wars were happening and people were falling in love and the stadium lights on route 17 lit the highway like bones.

“You don’t even like animals,” Leah said, when he told her during blueberry pancakes at Sammy’s, and she had her hair up like she always did, because she worked in pediatric cardio and didn’t like hair in a place where blood might splash. “You jumped a foot when that dog sniffed your shoulder in the elevator.”

“I don’t like surprise dogs,” Mason said, defensive. “And I like animals. I had a hermit crab.”

“You put a dumb sticker on its shell that said Go Mets, it walked in circles for days. It probably still is, somewhere. Why a hippo. Why not, I don’t know, a gerbil. A gerbil is room sized.”

“I don’t know,” Mason admitted, and the not knowing felt enormous and delicious. “I keep seeing them. They’re weird. They’re ancient. They open their mouths like cathedrals.”

“I think they also murder people,” Leah said, pouring too much syrup and letting it spill into a lake on the plate. “Which, knowing you, is part of the appeal. You’re going to get yourself killed by a hippo in the same town where you begged me to come help you when your smoke alarm battery beeped at 3 a.m.”

The waitress came and refilled their coffee and said, “Mason! You forgot your jacket last time, I hung it on the hook by the office.” He got up, the waitress’s apron smelling like onion and hot metal, and took the jacket on his way back, feeling the weight of it like a new idea. Hippo, he thought. Not as a gag, not as a thing to write on a whiteboard and then erase. Not as a segment in which he would stand in front of a green screen while video of a hippo in a clean zoo pond played behind him to the right. The word dug in.

There was a traveling wildlife talk that afternoon at Van Saun, part of the spring fair, the kind with teacup rides and a tent that sold stuffed animals that looked like bigger stuffed animals. Dina sent Mason, with Owen, who had been a camera operator in Afghanistan and now wore his baseball cap backwards like a boy, to cover the event. “Kids,” Dina said through the earpiece as they walked under the bunting and the bright helium animals straining to fly away. “Moms like to see their kids squeal on TV. Get faces, get squeal. Smile more than you’re feeling.”

Under the striped top of the tent, the air thick with hay and popcorn and a sweet smell like cigar boxes, a woman with a gentle voice introduced the animals. A falcon with eyes like arguments. A ferret that slept curled in its own tail. A tortoise that accepted a strawberry with the clinical dignity of a judge. No hippo, which disappointed Mason even though he had never expected one. Then the woman said somebody’s name and a slide flicked onto the sheet of white at the back of the tent. A photo, low-res and too bright, of a calf-sized shape rising from grey water. “We don’t have her, obviously,” the woman said, and the people laughed, including Mason, because how could a hippo be here. “This is Mirella. She was found after a flood last year in the Okavango, separated from her group. Because the water receded so fast, she ended up in a channel with a fence in the wrong place. A rescue group got her out.”

The murmur around him changed shape, the way a room does when a violin starts. The photo shifted to a short video: the small hippo’s ears fluttering like two absurd seashells, her mouth opening to show pink unrealness, a woman’s hand holding a bottle the size of a baseball bat. The word adopted appeared on the slide in big letters that were meant to be playful, like something you would put on a cake. “We’re partnered with the rescue, and we’re sponsoring her rehab,” the woman said. “Twenty dollars gets your child’s name on her stand. We call it adoption, symbolically.”

Owen nudged Mason with his elbow while the camera rolled. “Get a mom, get you with a mom,” he said. “Ask about the, the symbolism. Moms cry if you say the word symbolism, I swear.”

Instead, Mason stepped closer to the stage, listened to the way the woman from the rescue shaped her mouth around Mirella when she said it, hard r in the middle, a little rustle of Italian even though the river the little animal belonged to was on the other side of the world. He was thinking, No, not symbolic. Not a certificate you hang on a magnet board and then let curl in the dry air of a kitchen. He could see the hippo’s eye in the video, weirdly human, baleful, alive and taking it all in with a judgment that felt older than the town, the county, older than his own idea of himself as a person who presented things to other people.

When the talk ended and the handler started lifting the ferret to let a line of careful children touch its back, Mason went up to the woman and flashed his press badge like it meant something. “Hi,” he said. “I’m Mason, we’re local media, could I—Do you have five? And, if I ask you something insane, could you please not tell my producer until we’re off-site?”

The woman laughed. “Sure,” she said. “I’m Talia. That’s my cell on the flyer, don’t put it on your website. You look like you need to nap.”

“Do you know what it would take,” Mason said, ridiculous, “to adopt a hippo? I mean, not just symbolically. Like legally. Like bring-her-home adopt.”

Owen made a sound, a little cough like a transmission slipping. The woman blinked, then her mouth tilted into a grin that wasn’t unkind. “It would take a lot,” she said, “and also possibly a helicopter, a continent, several laws, like twelve, and a water feature bigger than your car. Also, it’s…we don’t relocate them. Not when they’re healthy. This is a rehab, she’ll go back.”

“So there are ways,” Mason said, and heard how absurd he sounded and did not care. “There are laws, and laws can be read. Read and, not broken, but… reinterpreted. I’m a presenter,” he added, as if this implied he knew anyone powerful. “For a show. In Paramus.”

“I grew up over the bridge in Hackensack,” she said. “I know what Paramus is. I know about the parking lots that join hands.” Her face softened. “Why a hippo?”

He wanted to say because his life had gotten too flat, like somebody had rolled it with a pin. He wanted to say because a hippo is impossible and he wanted to do an impossible thing while his hairline still held. Because he had never married and had no dog and had a mother who kept calling to ask about doctors because her friends had started saying the word oncology like a weather report. Instead he said, “Because they’re beautiful and everyone thinks they’re not.”

“Everyone thinks nothing at all,” she said. “They think about thighs and driving. They don’t think about hippos.”

“Then I want them to.”

He got what he needed for the segment. Talia held the tortoise and said the names of two organizations. A small girl explained that she loved Mirella even though she had never seen her in person. Owen got his mom-cry. Mason, in his outro, said something about connecting the local to the global and Talia smiled politely and said, “This is sponsored by the county parks department,” which was the only sentence the county would later quote when they posted it on their website.

That night, he typed “hippo adoption” into his laptop and received a thousand bright green forms for symbolic packages. He bought one, impulsively, because the money went to Mirella’s rescue and because he wanted to stop being the person who never clicked the final button. For twenty dollars they would send him a bent-paper certificate with his name on it and a soft toy shaped like something that resembled no hippo. He filled his shipment address with one finger and then refilled his wine.

Then he typed, “Can you actually adopt a hippo,” without a question mark because punctuation felt like permission. He found a chain of pages that ranged from very official to a man named Dan in Wisconsin who claimed he had a lynx in his house with a photo of large cat that was clearly photoshopped on top of a burgundy sofa. He found lists of permits and rules and a paragraph so dense it looked like a city skyline. He read about large exotic animals and dangerous wildlife and exceptions and sanctuaries and a word he loved instantly: custodian. He read until he could feel the Finder window of his brain refuse to open one more tab.

“You’re high,” Leah said when he called her after eleven. Her voice in the dark, muffled: she was probably brushing, Morse code against molars. “On the idea, I mean. Do not crash like with the time you were going to go to culinary school for mushroom sauces. Go to bed.”

“I bought a certificate,” he said.

“Of course you did. Mason, listen to me.”

He listened because she was his older sister and because she’d lifted him out of bathtubs as a child and out of worse, later. “Please do a segment,” she said. “Do a good one. Get the animal people money. And then fix your blinds and get a plant you can’t kill.”

He was going to hang up, say goodnight, but the word was still in his throat like a seed he needed to spit into his palm. “I think I’m going to try,” he said. “I’m going to try to adopt a hippo. Not symbolic. A real one.”

Leah didn’t answer for a moment, and he could hear the electric buzz of her bathroom light. “It won’t happen,” she said, not cruel, just true. “And if it did, you would die. And if you didn’t die, Mom would. If you get a hippo you can only invite people over who you hate.”

“I don’t hate anyone,” he said, too quickly, and thought of Brett Harrow like a taste in his mouth he had never gotten rid of.

Brett had been Mason’s rival since high school when Brett decided one morning that Mason’s face, his tone, his careful pencils, were exactly the kind of things he despised. Brett went into radio and then into a internet channel that ate his radio show and then somehow into a job in Newark that had the word Director in it. The last time Mason had run into him was in the cold aisle of the ShopRite at Bergen Town Center when both of them were reaching for oat milk for reasons neither could believe.

“Look at us,” Brett had said, and there was a tiny spittle at the corner of his mouth like his body thought it was still on air and needed to lubricate. “You ever going to get on a real network or you like being king of suburbia?”

“I enjoy my job,” Mason had lied, and Brett had grinned, wide and mean, and said, “You always did like the easy ones.” Which was rich because Brett had made a career out of being the loudest man in the room.

He didn’t tell Leah he was thinking about Brett. He hung up and watched a video on mute of Mirella lifting her head out of a tub where someone was hosing the mud off her back. The caption was written like a letter from the hippo, which irritated him more than it should have. The girl writing the copy meant well. He put his phone face down. He stared into the rectangle of his window where the sky moved, unseen, built of concrete, lights, planes, night.

In the morning, the station smelled like new marker and the old dust of things that don’t sell. Dina had a bagel in her hand and a plastic water bottle tucked in her armpit and said, “Don’t be mad but I put up the clip and I used a still of you with the tortoise because you look like you’re crying in it and it tested well with the people who follow us. Did you cry. If you cried tell me so I can write something pure.”

“Symbolically,” Mason said. “I symbolically cried.”

“I have three pitches,” she said, ignoring him because she had to. “A piece on the sewage project on Midland Ave, a piece on the closing of the trampoline park because the owner ran a pyramid scheme, and another animal thing because that did numbers. Guess which you’re doing?”

“I want to do my own thing,” he said, his heart tapping at the inside of his throat like a moth at a light, trying to outfly his caution. “An adoption story.”

“We did one last month,” Dina said. “Cat named Ghost with one eye. Girl with a band poster in every shot, loved Ghost in a way that made me worry for adulthood.”

“Hippo,” he said. He didn’t say the name, because it felt like saying the name would make it too sweet, and then Dina would bite it and spit it out. “Real adoption. Legal, filings. The process. The reasons.”

Dina blinked her black liner eyeliner at him. She could look disbelieving without moving any part of her face except for the tiny hinge of her left eyebrow. “Mason. Are you in love again. Did you meet a woman who can bench press you and also lives with a hippo and I should have her on after the dog that does math.”

“File it under an oddball expose,” he said. “What the law says about large animals. People want to see me fail. Let them watch. Or, I don’t fail and we get the biggest numbers we’ve had since we accidentally aired the shot of the man falling on his face at the street fair.”

“You got so many emails about that,” she said, dreaming. “Alright. Fine. But you have to do two in the can this week first. Sewage and the trampoline crook. And I have to meet the hippo person. And if I catch even a sniff of you doing something stupid like going to the airport with a duffel and a passport and a t-shirt that says Save Mirella I will call your sister and she will break both your kneecaps because she has access to better hammers than I do.”

“She really does,” Mason said. “She has hammers that are also computers.”

“Go,” Dina said, and pointed to the hallway like a general.

The plan was a plan the way a paper boat is a boat. He would do the morning’s taping, then he would research. He would find out the full shape of the rules. He would talk to the county. He would call Talia and ask for introductions to somebody who worked within the thing he was thinking of. He would start with a symbolic adoption and then he would move toward another word altogether, one he didn’t have. Guardian maybe, or, steward, or host. He’d get laughed at and then not laughed at. He would, he would.

At lunch he walked to the small patch of trees behind the studio where people pretended to get fresh air while they scrolled through their phones. He sat on a bench that a Boy Scout had donated before either of them were born and took out the printouts he had made of the rules that might apply. Large animal. Exotic. Dangerous. Native. He looked for loopholes like a kid looks for shapes in clouds. He found a clause about zoos and a clause about educational institutions and a clause about permits for temporary import for the purposes of, and a lot of words like subject to and provided that and notwithstanding. He circled them with a pen the color of cherries. He wrote parody next to one, and then crossed it out because he didn’t want to make fun of the law. He wanted to court it.

It was there that his phone pinged with a notification from a local page that he followed because it was dumb—an account that posted videos of people parallel parking badly. A new post had popped up and the caption said, “Our guy is back.” Mason tapped it because his thumb loved to be tricked, and Brett’s face appeared in the middle of the screen.

He was standing in front of a municipal building in Newark, his hair more expensive than it used to be, his jaw stiffer. The video was him and a man in a suit that didn’t fit. It took Mason a moment to realize that the second man was an actual official, and that the video was not on the parking account at all but was being served to him as an ad in the middle of his scrolling. He put his hand on his chest, steadying something inside him. Brett was framing his shot, ear piece in, talking. “We’re here today because this town needs someone,” he said, the kind of vague you put over mush. “I’m not a politician,” Brett said, and Mason snorted in spite of himself. “I’m a citizen. A father—”

“You don’t have kids,” Mason said aloud.

“—and a voice for people who are tired of not being listened to. They have their rules. We have our rules.”

The sentence planted itself in the dirt of Mason’s afternoon. Brett was going to run for something. Mason had the weird thought that he should call him, make a truce, ask him whether he felt sick to his stomach at night when the red light went off, like Mason sometimes did, as if someone had jerked him off a horse. Instead he closed the ad, put his phone on its face. The bench creaked. A blackbird landed on the low iron fence and looked at him with bright eyes.

At four, his mother called because a friend of hers had sent her a screenshot of the “Morning Paramus” page with the still of him holding the tortoise. “You looked soft,” she said. “Are you okay?”

“I’m fine,” he said. “Hi, Mom.”

“I don’t like turtles,” she said. “They live too long.” There was a little static. “Did Leah tell you we’re going to Florida in July because Aunt Dana thinks she’s going to die in August. I said to her, Dana, we can get you to August just fine without Florida. The way she dramatizes.”

“You’re dramatizing the dramatizer,” he said, and leaned his head against the phone. “I’m going to adopt a hippo,” he said, and then he smiled because he hadn’t meant to say it, couldn’t help it.

“Oh,” she said, and he could hear her pour water into a glass, her bracelets chiming. “Like a child. Mason, it’s too late to do international adoption and also I don’t, I don’t think they would let you, you don’t have a yard.”

“Like a hippo,” he said gently.

He listened to her laugh, a bird sound he loved. “Okay,” she said. “Call me when you get it.”

He printed the word HIPPO and taped it to the cork board above his desk. He wrote the other words around it: Mirella. Adopter. Alley-of-laws. Water feature. He wrote his own name and thought it looked like the name of someone who could pilot this.

When he told the crew at the afternoon meeting, nobody stopped him, but they grinned in a way that felt like a classroom. Owen said, “What if you adopt a fish. We could put a camera on the fish. Fish Cam.” Tammy from graphics said, “I can draw a hippo that looks like you.” Dina said, “Get me experts. I don’t want a letter from a person with an acronym after their name that could be a pest control company and also a state agency.” The intern said, “We had hippos on my island,” and then blushed and explained that his grandmother’s stories from the old country weren’t about hippos so much as water buffalo, and everyone in the room agreed that water buffalo were very different and, also, possibly exactly the same.

He called Talia. It rang three times and he was ready to leave the script he had written—hi, it’s Mason from earlier, no pressure, I wanted to ask about info—and she picked up. “I wondered if you’d call,” she said. He asked if he could meet her somewhere without hay and she said yes.

They sat at a cafe that had more plants than tables and she ordered an espresso and stained the cup in a way that made Mason wish he had an espresso cup to stain in his own apartment. He told her, in words that he had decided to make plain, that he was going to pursue the adoption of a hippopotamus. He kept his voice steady. She listened. “I’m not going to help you get a wild animal out of its river,” she said, after he finished, because sentences like that were why he liked her. “Even a rehabbed one. What I can do is tell you who keeps the rules. And what they look like. And why nothing on earth is only what it looks like.”

He wrote the names down. A state department office. A Federal one. An organization that sounded like a benevolent cult but was just an accreditation body. Another rescue, not hers. A woman who had been a vet for thirty years and could tell you things about hippo incisors that would make you feel you hadn’t learned a single useful thing in your whole life. He asked questions and she answered them. “They’re dangerous as anything,” she said. “Not because they’re angry all the time. Because their bodies do one thing and they do it very well. They are heavy and alive in a way that makes everything else seem like paper in a breeze. They don’t understand chairs. You cannot teach a hippo to respect your couch.”

“I don’t respect my couch,” he said.

She laughed. “Get this in your story: what they are in the water is not what they are on land. And people always assume one or the other will prevail.”

When he left, he had the names of more strangers than he’d had in months. He called Leah again but didn’t tell her he had a list. He called his mother to ask about dinner and not mention the word hippo once, as if he could prove he had impulse control by not saying something for one entire hour. He went home and touched the corner of the certificate that had already arrived unbelievably fast, the mail like magic when you wanted it to be slow. He put the soft toy on the chair in his kitchen and found himself standing over it, like an altar he had made and could not fully believe in.

The next morning, he put on his blue tie, because he liked how blue lay against his throat, and he drove to the county office and asked to speak with someone about a classification. The security guard looked at his badge, the show’s logo small and neat, and said, “I love your cooking segments.” A woman in an olive sweater came to the glass and said, “Do you have an appointment.” He said, “This is Mason Kline, Morning Paramus. Can I ask you a question about the permits required to legally adopt and house a—” and he said the word hippo but softer in the middle, like prayer.

The woman put her hands on the ledge of the window as if she were going to vault it. “No,” she said. “But I’d love to hear why you’re asking.”

“Because it’s my job,” he said, “and also because it’s my job,” and she smiled and said, “Go around.” He sat in a conference room that had a painting of a mountain that was either Alaska or brown New Jersey with clouds. A man with little white half moons of hair above his ears came in with a folder and put it down and said, “This week?”

“We’re doing a series on local adoption laws,” Mason lied. “You know, goldfish and snakes,” he added, aware that he was insulting them and also prepared to lean into it if it got him somewhere. “And I wanted to include a segment on the extreme. What is too big. Who says.”

The man with the half moons opened his folder as if he did this every day, and maybe he did. “Sir,” he said, “we have rules for a reason. We have to consider the welfare of the animal, the public, the environment.”

“Hypothetically,” Mason said, and watched the way the man’s eyes changed when he said the word, as if it held a charge or a smell. “If someone wanted to pursue this.”

The man told him. Not straight, not no. Words like facility, containment, standard, liability. He could hear the shape of yes inside the haystack of the no. The man said, “You would need a partner. An accredited institution.”

“Like a zoo,” Mason said, and the man nodded at whatever the definition of zoo was that allowed it to be many things. “Useful.”

When he left the building, the sky was the kind of blue that makes you dislike metaphor because it feels like a cliché and also exactly the right thing. He got into his car and his phone buzzed on the seat. A message from Dina, yelling in text. A message from Leah that just contained a cartoon of a hippopotamus that was so wrong it felt like a personal insult. And a message that made his finger twitch like a muscle spasm.

It was a link to a news story. “Radio Personality Announces Bid For Office,” it read, and the photo was Brett again, grinning at a lectern, three flags behind him as if they were going to anoint him with stars. The article said he was running for a county seat and had real money behind him and some people liked him. The comments under the story had two hundred entries before noon and they were the kind that make you feel both less alone and more depressed. Mason read one aloud in his car. “Finally, someone who will tell the truth,” said one. “Harrow is the only person who hates corruption more than he hates himself,” said another, which made Mason laugh too loud.

He could feel the way the world was tilting. He could feel the architecture of the month. He thought of a pool, the deep end always calling you to make a dive you haven’t trained for.

He drove to the zoo. Bergen County’s little one, small and neat, no hippo. He went because he wanted to be near animals who knew what they were. He stood and watched the capybaras like they were an argument in his favor. They looked like hippos if you squinted with your brain and took away three thousand pounds. A child in a red hat said, “They look like rocks with hearts,” and Mason wanted to turn to the child’s mother and say, “You’re raising that person, good job.” He wanted to call Talia again. He wanted to call Brett, which was insane and a little delicious. He wanted coffee.

Instead he did the thing he has learned he must do in order to keep his head out of the shoals: he took a small step. He called the vet whose name Talia had given him, and when she picked up and said her name in a voice that had been honed on hard days, he said his—and he said hippo—and he listened to her sigh.

“They’re not yours,” she said after he talked. “They’re not mine. But there’s a reason people want to bring them close. They have this—what’s the word—density. Of living. You want to stand next to it and feel that you are heavy, too.”

“Yes,” Mason said, shocked by his own yes.

He went home with a folder of papers and his head playing the newscast he would give when he had to explain these papers to his audience and also to his own heart. He answered three emails from men named Greg who wanted to sell him advertising space and ignored one from a man who said he could get him a permit “no questions asked.” He cooked eggs and threw out the shells and then took them out of the trash to check that he could compost them if he had, as he thought he might someday, a yard. He stood by the window and looked at the rectangle of late light falling on his kitchen floor and stood in the rectangle until the light moved and he had to move too.

He saw Brett twice more that week, not in the flesh but on his phone in videos where Brett went to a diner that used to be a gas station and filmed himself pouring syrup on pancakes he did not eat. “People first,” Brett said into the camera, and Mason said, “Hippo first,” under his breath, like a prayer or a dare. He did his scheduled segments and the sewage project smelled more metaphorical than it should have and he laughed too hard in the trampoline park because the kid on the sign behind him looked like he was cheering on the pyramid scheme.

He told Dina he wanted to roll. “Give me a slot,” he said. “Let me start with a cold open with me saying hippopotamus. We can build a graphic, you can put me in a boat in post, whatever makes you feel alive.”

“I never feel alive,” she said. “Fine. Tuesday. We’ll tease it Monday. No crazy. No airports. No going to a river unless it’s in Westwood.”

On Monday he woke before the alarm, the sky lighter than his kitchen blinds could manage, the word in his mouth. He had a dream in which Mirella had come up his apartment stairs and stood in his hallway, taking up all the air. In the dream he had thought, Oh, I didn’t think about the floor load of my life.

He got into his car and drove to work and the radio told him the weather, and then, as he took the ramp onto route 17 he heard a voice he knew too well. Brett was talking about safety, about bringing back something lost, his tone like a man leading a scout into a cave he’d been in before. “They want to say no to everything,” Brett said, and Mason could feel him smile. “But I’m not a no person. I’m not even a yes person. I’m a, let’s see, let’s try, let’s make our own rules. If there’s a wall, I go over it. If you put a river in front of me, I find a hippo and ride it across.”

Mason snorted at the windshield, and the snort turn into something else, a sound that was almost a laugh and almost a sob. “You don’t even know how to pronounce Mirella,” he said to no one. He signaled, he checked his blind spot, he changed lanes. Behind him a truck honked, loud and disapproving. In front of him the day opened up like a mouth. He thought, I’m doing this. He thought, I’m not. He thought, no one is going to support me, which was maybe, already, part of why he had chosen it.

At the studio, Dina said, “You have lipstick on your collar, whose,” and he said, “Who wears lipstick anymore,” and then wiped at nothing. He stood in front of the green screen and looked straight into the camera as if he were telling a secret only to one person, which was what he had learned to do all along. He said, “Hippopotamus,” and felt the room become a river. He said, “Paramus,” and he said, “This town has rules,” and then he smiled like a man who has decided to walk into a wall to see if it is, in fact, there. Later, when he watched the clip, he would hate the way his left eye twitched. He would love the way he didn’t apologize.

After the segment, Mason went out back and stood by the air conditioning units that shuddered in their cages, put his hand on the metal that hummed and thought, This is nothing like a river, good. He thought of the shape of what he wanted again, and he could feel how the people he knew would push back, how they would call him foolish and sometimes something worse. He could see Leah’s mouth flatten. He could see Dina’s eye doing the thing. He could see the old men at the deli making jokes about hippos in the parking lot. He could feel the approach of something he could not name yet. He had once heard someone say, “Every good story begins with someone wanting something impossible,” and he had rolled his eyes because he rolled them a lot, a reflex. He didn’t roll them now.

The phone in his pocket buzzed. He thought it would be Leah or Dina or an acronym from a state office calling to tell him please stop asking or start asking the right people. He pulled the phone out, and it was none of them. The name on the screen was a number he did not have in his contacts and then a voice that felt like a fist in his chest.

“Kline,” the voice said. “It’s Brett.” The silence after his name was like a smirk, thick with memory and the smell of cold grocery store aisles and teenage sweat. “I saw your hippo bit.”

“It wasn’t a bit,” Mason said, but too fast, which made it sound like he knew he was lying.

“Cute,” Brett said. “Listen. Be careful. People think you’re silly when you say things like that. And there are, you know, laws.”

“I know,” Mason said. He looked up at the white sky and thought, I’m speaking to a man who wants to be elected to a chair with rules and he is warning me about rules as if I hadn’t learned to read already in the first grade.

“I’ll be at the diner Thursday,” Brett said. “I’ll buy you eggs. We can talk about your, your thing. Maybe there’s a way to make it work for both of us.”

“For who,” Mason asked, but Brett had already hung up.

It wasn’t a victory. It wasn’t anything he could put in a closing segment. But that moment, the thick voice in his ear, the offer of eggs, felt like a new hinge in the architecture of what he was trying to build. He put the phone away. He went back inside and smiled at Owen and smiled at Dina and took the script for the segment they had to tape next and barely read it. He walked onto the set like someone who had just picked a fight with a river and was waiting to see whether the river would bother to fight back. He said his words. He looked into the lens. The small red light came on and his mouth moved, sure and strange, in a life he had chosen and that was now, a little, choosing him back.Chapter 3

By Thursday the word had worn a path through his mouth, a groove like something put there by a small persistent river. He woke in the dark to his phone shuddering and thought it was Leah calling from a supply closet at the hospital, then saw the glow and the soft reminder he had set for himself that said Breakfast with Harrow and felt his stomach move the way a fish does when it is brought too near the surface. He made coffee and it smelled like scorched pennies because the machine needed to be descaled, and he told himself he would descale it, he would descale everything. He put on the blue tie again because there was a superstition building that the blue made people say yes, and he smooth-palmed his hair and watched himself in the mirror have a man-to-man with his own face about tone. Do not be sweet, he told his face, and also do not be cruel. Be local, be factual, be the person who can read a paragraph that looks like a skyline and then tell a child in a red hat that rocks have hearts.

The diner was one of those that had metal dented by decades of elbows and coffee rings that would not be persuaded by napkins. He liked it for its honesty and because the waitress always called him hon without knowing it meant something to him. The air smelled as it always did here, onion and hot metal and syrup that had tried to be wiped and refused. Brett was early, or else he was late and had decided he would pretend he was early by standing already with a cup and a grin when Mason came through the door. He was wearing a jacket the color of car leather and his haircut was precise enough to make you think of line levels and carpenters. His smile found Mason and it was exactly as remembered, the smile of a boy who had learned to show teeth as a method of possession.

“Kline,” he said, red, white and blue in his voice even when he said only four letters. “You look good on the morning light. It suits the soft ones.”

“Eggs,” Mason said, because he was not going to let himself answer the insult with a compliment, and also because he actually wanted eggs, which felt honest. “You said eggs.”

They sat in a booth where the vinyl made the kind of small sigh that only vinyl makes when you sit down on it as if you were interrupting a conversation the seat was having with itself. The waitress materialized and listed the specials, and Brett snapped in the air where her nameplate would have been if the diner had nameplates. He ordered something that used the word skillet twice and asked for hot sauce with a tone that turned hot sauce into a referendum. Mason asked for scrambled, wheat toast, dry, and then immediately undid the modesty of dry by asking for butter on the side.

“I saw your hippo,” Brett said, folding his hands like a person in a pamphlet about negotiations. “You leaned. You said the word like it was a secret. That’s your thing, yeah, the secret pitch.”

“I like to think my thing is telling people something they don’t think they need to know yet,” Mason said, and then felt the sentence was too pretty and added, “Also bagels.”

Brett laughed in the soundless way of television people who have learned to turn the laugh down so it can be turned up later. “You know this town,” he said. “They don’t like big. They bought the houses with the roofs that slope like they’re apologizing. But they like a fair. A fair is a manageable large. I’m saying there’s a way to turn your hippopotamus into a fair forever.”

He reached into his jacket and produced a folder that was the kind of folder that has weight on its own, like the folder itself had passed a test. Mason watched the folder sit there between the salt and the small pyramid of white sugar packs like a casket someone had forgotten to close. He did not put his hand on it because his hands had decided they were going to behave. He watched Brett enjoy the folder before he slid it across the table with a tiny flick as if it were a trophy puck.

“Land,” Brett said. “Out in Sussex. Not mine,” he added, and smiled in a way that told Mason it would be his soon. “But a friend. He’s looking for a way to turn it into something that sings. A trail, a water feature. An educational partner. People love the word partner. We could get the county interested if there’s an attraction. Everything is an attraction if it has a parking lot and a banner. With the right help, with the right message, you could do it. We put your face on it. We put our name on it. Everybody wins.”

The waitress slid plates onto the table in a choreography that made Mason love her and the world more than he had moments before. The eggs smelled like eggs should smell and the toast reached a fragile compromise between burnt and bread. Brett picked up his fork in a way that suggested he was about to conduct an orchestra that had not agreed to play. “I can get you in the room with the board,” he said as if boards were rooms and not tables with many people and rules. “You can stand there and say steward and custodian and all the soft words that make them feel less scared about giant mouths full of stone teeth. I can stand there and say jobs. We do the old dance, you say heart, I say number. We’re a team for a moment.”

“And in exchange,” Mason said, because he needed to hear him say it even though he could feel the shape of the exchange in the way Brett’s eyes moved over the diner like it belonged to him.

“In exchange,” Brett said, “you stop doing the gotcha thing when it’s me. You don’t cut the part where the guy called me a slur and I said thank you. You give me ten minutes every other week to talk about the county like it’s a family that needs a dad. You say words like common sense and safety. You teach the ladies who like your tie that I am not dangerous unless you’re scared of a man who gets things done.”

Mason chewed and listened to his mouth, because sometimes his mouth told truths his brain was trying to unhear. The food went down like information, which was how a certain kind of food goes down, not pretty or pleasurable so much as steady. “You want my hippo to be your parade,” he said, and when Brett smiled he thought about a high school hallway and two lockers and a hand he had watched once, long ago, push a smaller hand.

“You always make it uglier than it has to be,” Brett said, and dabbed his mouth with a napkin in a way that made Mason imagine that his mouth was a stain he was constantly trying to contain. “I want to be associated with impossible things that become possible. It’s good for you too. People like to watch a guy finally pick a lane.”

Mason took the folder and opened it because he had come to open the folder and that was the rule he had set for himself. There were glossy photos of a field that was green in the way green knows how to perform in June, with trees that had decided to stand and a low stretch of water that might have been a pond if you believed in ponds. There were schematic drawings of curves that suggested paths and fences that pretended not to be fences. The words in the packet were careful words, the kind that avoided saying enclosure by saying view. There was a rendering of a building with glass that wanted to be lake. At the bottom, in the corner, a logo that was not yet a logo but might become one, letters that could become HHH and the H’s meant to stand for someone’s name but easily convertible to Harrow Hippopotamus Habitat if you lacked imagination.

“You think I’m as vain as you are,” Mason said, and regretted the sentence but did not take it back. “You think I want my name on a fence.”

“I think you want to get it done in your lifetime,” Brett said, and used lifetime like a knife you buy because the ad said it would never dull. “I think you want to feel heavy, not just pretend heavy on television. This does that. You just have to stop pretending that ethics are a thing you do alone in a room. Ethics are a team sport. You know where the teammates are.”

The waitress poured more coffee into Mason’s cup without asking and squeezed his shoulder as if she knew his blood sugar was not the only thing that needed help. He could see Leah’s face in his mind, the way it would arrange itself to tell him he was a moron in a way that would keep him alive. He could see Dina’s eyebrow. He could see Talia folding her arms across her chest and thinking about rivers that had not asked to be made into banners.

“I’ll look,” he said, and then to punish himself slightly for the word look, he added, “But I won’t be for sale.”

“You’re already for sale, pal,” Brett said, cheerful. “You just don’t like to admit that you also need to buy.”

They ate and Brett left without really leaving, the air in the diner still holding him, the chairs still a little to the side as if they had made room for shoulders that took more than they needed. Mason stayed with the check, his hands touching it, not for money but for the physical reassurance of an amount. He paid and tipped too much and when he left a child at the next table lifted up a placemat they had been coloring and showed him a purple shape with tiny ears and a giant smile that suggested a future meekness. “Hippo,” the child said, and Mason said, “Yes,” and had to swallow because the word had reached his throat unexpectedly from another mouth and made something old inside him stir.

Outside, the day was the kind of day that would be described on a weather channel with a graphic that looked like a sweater. He called Leah because there are moments when you must call someone who will jab you with a needle and not apologize. She picked up and he heard the hospital in the background, a kind of hum made of wheels and worry, and she said, “Are you dead,” as hello.

“Not dead,” he said. “Breakfast with Brett. He has land and a logo and he wants to help me adopt something if I help him adopt the county.”

He heard her exhale and thought about the shape of her mouth around the exhale, a habit of his since they were children and he would watch her explain to their mother why the toothpaste cap should be tightened. “Why are you always surprised when the boy who showed you his teeth shows you his teeth,” she said. “He’s doing the thing he does. Do not let him wrap his hand around your idea and pretend it’s your idea he’s holding when we all know it’s just your wrist.”

“I know,” Mason said. “But I opened the folder.”

“I knew you would,” Leah said, not unkind. “Listen, I had a kid this morning. Tiny. I held a plastic heart in my hand for twenty minutes while someone else did the stitching and I had this thought that I will be chasing all day. We fix the little tubes and the blood acts like it’s been waiting all this time to make its own decision again. If you do this hippo thing, you cannot just move a problem. You have to build the little tubes. You have to be the boring thing. You have to be the filter. The pump. If you think he is going to buy you a pump without buying you, then you are cuter than I remember, and you were very cute in second grade.”

“I do want to be the pump,” he said, and he laughed because what else are you going to say when your sister calls you a pump. “You know anybody on a board who is not for sale.”

She made a sound like moving a chair. “Marjorie Velasquez,” she said. “PT mom. Her kid has a valve that likes to sing at the wrong time. She sits on the parks committee and she makes a list before she goes to the bathroom because she likes to make lists of lists. She could show you the steps. She likes steps. She lives in a house with six different staircases for no reason.”

“Will you text me her number,” he said, and Leah said yes and told him to buy a plant he could not kill, pothos or snake, and to stop wearing shirts that pretended they weren’t blue when they were very blue, and then she had to go because the hum in the background had shifted to a pitch that meant someone needed to run.

By afternoon he had a message from Marjorie that contained three exclamation points and the words big fan in a way that did not make him regret asking. She liked the show in the way that meant she could tell him which sponsor had the worst jingle. She agreed to meet him by the turtle pond at the county zoo because that was where she ate pretzels when her brain required salt and something slowly moving in water. Mason went because he had started to learn that if you put your body near other bodies doing the thing they were meant to do, you got smarter without trying.

Marjorie was the kind of person who had a clipboard even when she was just a person being a person. She had hair that she arched into practical and sneakers that had climbed more stairs than he had walked this month. She shook his hand and then handed him a pretzel and said, “If you’re going to tell me you’re trying to bring a hippopotamus to Paramus, pick another p-word for God’s sake. Even I can’t.” He laughed because he liked her immediately. She gestured to the pond where the turtles acted like old men sitting in a shade with their shirts unbuttoned.

“Okay,” she said. “Here’s your problem. The thing you want is not just big. It’s wide. It touches a dozen committees and an alphabet soup that we pretend tastes good because it makes us feel like adults. You can’t do the thing unless you are the thing. You get me? You need an entity that is not you but that is like you. A foundation. A partner with letters. The zoo cannot do it. Not this zoo. We do capybaras and goats and we do like, lemurs sometimes. Do I look like a woman who has room for a river? However, we could support a partnership. The AZA people will have opinions. There are Species Plans. Hippos are not a bring-one-home animal even if you had ten helicopters and seven laws made of soft butter. But if what you want is to light the county on fire in a helpful way, there are other things. A traveling something. A watching something. A big wicked smart education exhibit that makes people hand their money over because they feel we handed them a gift.”

He looked at the turtles because the turtles were honest, and he said, “I want the animal,” and then he heard himself and thought that if he could go back five minutes he would pat himself on the head. “I want to bring the density close. I want to stand next to it and let this town understand that all the things they think about big and heavy are more complicated than trucks.”

Marjorie nodded in the way of a person who has a husband or partner who does not listen to what she says until four years later. “Then we start with watching,” she said. “We start with the river and we let the animal stay in the river because, truly, sir, the river is not a street you can rename because your cousin died. You stream it. You partner with the rehab. You build a room with light like lake light. You find a civil engineer who likes fish. You build a toy mouth the size of a Honda and kids can stand inside it and count the teeth while you talk to them about how nothing that wants to live is gentle when it eats. You put sinks where kids can wash their hands and you make the sinks low and you unscrew the soap pumps and collect their cranked donations one sticky palm at a time. You let me run the volunteer list. I will grow you an army you do not deserve.”

He had not expected to be moved by the description of soap pumps, but here he was with the sap running, the idea of sticky coins making him think about the small economies of afternoons with Leah at the pool, of quarters turned into grape pops and victory. “What if that is the thing,” he said. “What if that is the way to honor an animal without dragging it across a map.”

Marjorie smiled a smile that was small but so confident it could pull a truck. “Then I can help you,” she said. “I cannot help you if you want to say zoo and mean I get to have a beast because I bought leggings that say Beast Mode. But if you want to spend your mornings making careful people slightly uncomfortable in a generous way, I can help. And I will even stand next to you at meetings with old men who measure their opinion in decibel.”

By the capybaras, a child dropped a grape into the moat and the grape bobbed like a green planet that had lost its orbit. Mason watched the animal look at the grape as if it might be an email and then decide it did not need to respond. He decided something small and named it a decision, because calling things decisions sometimes helps them become one: he would do the boring thing in the exciting way. He would call Talia and tell her he needed the stream, the feed, the permission to put a little black camera near Mirella’s mud in a manner that would make nobody in Botswana hate him. He would build a room where the water would lift and the light would go glass-blue and people would sit and let the density come to them like weather.

He called Talia in the parking lot with the faux river rocks by his shoes and told her about the exhibit pretend and the mouth and the sinks and the soap. She listened and said, “Yes,” in the way of a person who recognizes a switch flipping in a friend’s throat. “You can’t have her,” she said, because she needed to say it to keep her own bones aligned. “But you can help. I have a guy. He could rig a camera that can survive this kind of mud and this kind of child who thinks he is a man. We would need to ask four levels of permission because we do not flout rivers. But it is possible. Also, if you are going to say her name on television, you have to say our names too. The people who hold her bottle. The people who clean the algae. Names are the only thing we have when the lights go out.”

“I can say names,” he said. “I am good at names. I will say them like prayers and not like slogans.”

“You will sometimes slip,” she said. “But you will try.”

He went back to the studio with his car full of the smell of pretzel and the sense of being on a small boat that had found a current. Dina looked up when he came in and said, “You didn’t get arrested at the diner, shame, we could have used the tape,” and he put the packet from Brett on her desk without comment. She did not open it because she had learned that some things only get more dangerous if you hold them. He told her about Marjorie and about soap and mouths. She cocked her head the way a sparrow does when it hears an insect behind bark. “We can sell a room full of mouth,” she said. “We can sell sinks. We can sell live mud. You get me the river and I will stack that river so tall with corporate love that your little hippo will be basking in a beam.”

“What about Brett,” he said, because even when you have a river plan you still have a man who wants to ride your animal across the county.

“Let him come to the sink and try to put his face on it,” Dina said, and she picked up the packet then and put it in her bottom drawer like a Bible in a hotel. “We take his calls because he will be in front of our faces for the rest of our lives. But we do not take his help when his help is a tangle. You want a grant. Not a check. You want grandma money, not uncle money. You want a million small hands.”

That night the building smelled like somebody had tried to sauté a shoe. He stood in his kitchen with the toy that did not look like a hippo on the chair and said, “I am sorry for the part of me that wanted your body and not your life,” which was ridiculous and also felt necessary. He called his mother and told her nothing because telling her would make her tell Aunt Dana and Aunt Dana would make a group text and he would be in a quilt he could not climb out of. He returned an email from Dr. Bhandari, who had finally sent her actual name and a paragraph about incisors that made him weak. She was willing to be on television as long as nobody asked her to smile, which he promised solemnly as if he could control the muscles of a stranger. She wrote, “Design for filtration is where people fail,” and sent him a link to a photo of a hippo pool being drained somewhere that looked like a version of hell where angels wore knee boots.

The first draft of the proposal looked like two people arguing in the margins of a high school yearbook. He wrote sentences like community density and Dina drew little skulls next to them and wrote no. He put in a line about Brett because he was still too in love with his own fear, and she crossed his name out so hard it made a little tear in the paper. They wrote in costs they made up and then crossed them out and replaced them with costs that a woman named Charlotte at the zoo told them would make their eyes bleed. They made a list of sinks. They made a list of possible names and then crossed them all off because the room should not be named for someone who had never met the animal.

There were emails. There were calls. The county sent a polite letter that said under no circumstances and then at the bottom one line that said unless and then three clauses that could be opened like little doors if you were willing to bring cookies. He texted Leah photos of faucets for children and she wrote back, “The whale one is cute but whales are not hippos, we are not animals,” which made him laugh in his kitchen at a noise level that concerned the upstairs neighbor. He turned off his lamp and the window became a TV for the night. He watched a plane make a white line across the slice of sky he could claim and he wondered if people on the plane were looking down at the grid and making up lives for the lights. He hoped someone would make up his and get to the part where he was not stupid quicker than he had.

On Friday morning they shot the piece with the cold open that made him sweat his collar. He stood in front of the green screen and he did not put a boat behind him even though Owen desperately wanted to put a boat behind him, and he said, “We want to stand by something heavy and stay alive.” He said, “This is about the things we do when we cannot have the thing we want.” He said, “I am going to build a room where you can put your hands in water and feel the pull of a place you will never touch,” and when he was done Dina said, “You’re getting churchy,” and he said, “I know,” and she said, “Fine,” and chose a thumbnail for the online posting where his mouth did not look like it was arguing with itself.

By noon Brett had posted a video where he poured fake mud onto a tarp behind his office and said, “We bring the world here,” and Mason put his head down on his desk for a full minute and thought about quitting and then he sat up and emailed Marjorie instead. Talia texted him a photo of a river the color of tea and said, “The guy says he can do it,” and he texted back three heart emojis because he has become a person who uses emojis, and then amended with actual words, because the rules of his life still required sentences.

The call came at four from a number he did not know. When he answered, a man told him that his request for a meeting with the accreditation body had been granted, provided he did not bring cameras and did not bring any words he had not read twice. Mason said, “I can read,” as humbly as he could make it sound, and the man said, “I’m sure,” in a way that suggested he had been disappointed by people who had said they could read before. After he hung up, he stood by the photocopier and watched the light pass under glass like a small ocean, and he held his proposal to the machine as if light alone could approve him.

That night he sat at his table and spread the pages like a tarot. He saw in the spread a tower and a river and a woman with a clipboard and a man with a bad haircut and a turtle. He fell asleep with his head on his arm and dreamed that he had to carry water in a sieve to a mountain, and in the dream he did not cry or rage; he just walked the slope and let the water fall and walked again, and the dream gave him the gift of waking with his mouth relaxed.

Saturday he went to his mother’s apartment with a pothos and a bag of soil that smelled like the kind of woods that have the agreement with mosquitoes. She made eggs in a pan that had belonged to his grandmother and told him that Aunt Dana had decided not to die in August after all because she had remembered the Hallmark sale in September, and he felt the relief like a small dog sleeping in another room. He did not say hippo once. She pointed to his tie—he wore a tie on Saturdays occasionally because it made old women in elevators smile—and asked him if he was in love, and he said, “With water,” and she said, “Be careful, water wears rock,” and he said, “That’s what I’m hoping.”

Sunday Talia called and said, “Mirella had a visitor. A boy with a scar and a borrowed shirt,” and he asked if the boy respected the fence and she said, “Yes,” and he breathed out a breath that had been living in him since he started saying the word out loud. He sat on his couch that he did not respect and he sorted receipts into a plastic bag, not because he needed them but because he needed the ritual of making a pile into a smaller pile. He went online and read what he could legally bring into a room where children would be encouraged to put their hands in water, and he watched three videos of hippos in zoos and felt sadder than he meant to, and then he watched one of Mirella turning in brown water like a planet rolling, and he felt the old ache arrange itself more kindly around his ribs.

He had thought the week would deliver him a single yes or a single no, but instead it had done what weeks do and given him twenty small before’s. He wrote them on a legal pad in his easiest handwriting: call the camera guy, make the room name a verb not a noun, ask Charlotte about filtration systems in winter, ask Leah about the heart exhibit at the science museum and whether we can steal it, write an email to the county that has gratitude in it and not apology. He wrote, “Do not eat with Brett again,” in the margin and drew two boxes next to it and filled one with a check because he had managed at least one thing already.

He went to bed with the window open just enough to let the night in without letting in the noise of the parking lot. He listened to the sound of someone upstairs draw a bath and the water rushing made him think of everything that was not a river and wanted to be. He said Mirella softly into his own room and wondered if the word had learned his mouth and would miss him when he stopped speaking it someday. He pictured the room he wanted to build, kids standing in the metal mouth, their faces open in the way faces only are when the thing in front of them has nothing to sell except itself. He traced the outline of something not yet made with his finger in the air and felt foolish and then purely, strangely happy. He closed his eyes. He did not dream of helicopters or fences. He dreamed of sinks, thousands of small, stubborn dispensers, and a shore of hands that knew how to turn and turn and turn.Chapter 5

The accreditation office lived on the ninth floor of a building that used to be a bank, the kind of place where marble makes you walk quieter, as if money is still in the walls and listening. They had told him no cameras, no Owen, no charming smile turned into gif, and so he went alone and wore a suit he only wore to funerals and meetings with acronyms. The waiting room had a ficus that was pretending to do well. A woman at the desk with a brooch shaped like a beetle nodded him into a conference room where the table was a long lane and the chairs had the punishing proportions that tell you to keep your spine in the right century.

There were three of them. A man with a shirt that was too crisp to trust. A woman with hair cut to match the angle of her jaw. Another man whose face had learned to soften people and who would not soften Mason because it was his job not to. They introduced themselves and their letters—curated and planned and management and humane; their vocabulary was a park with hedges you could not step through. He shook hands and felt his own palm try to sweat. He did not begin with hippo. He began with sink.

“Education first,” he said, because he had promised himself he would be the filter, not just the faucet. “A room in the county that streams a live feed from a rehabilitation site overseas. We want to build understanding that isn’t built on possession. The room will be staffed by people who can explain why captivity and care are not synonyms. We will name the names of the people who make actual things happen.”

They listened. They did the thing where their pens wrote down nothing and made you feel like they did. He told them about the mouth kids could stand inside and count teeth with gloved hands and instructions printed in typeface big enough to shame. He said filtration the way Dr. Bhandari had told him to say it: as if it were a prayer to pipes. He said that if the room happened, then perhaps, later, they could consider a partner thing, a temporary thing, an approved thing that would touch the Species Plan lightly with a finger that had washed itself first.

“The Hippopotamus is not a prop,” the man with the crisp shirt said as if he said that sentence every Thursday to people with bright eyes. “You would need to understand that nothing you build is about your town. It would be about her.”

“I do,” Mason said, afraid he didn’t and loving the fear because it kept him at an angle that made him careful.

The woman asked about money. The soft-faced man asked about insurance. They asked about winter, which in this office was a metaphor for everything you forgot because you believed in the light. Mason told them what Charlotte had told him about pumps and chlorine and children who would try to drink the exhibit if left alone. He told them about the county letter with its tiny door disguised as unless. He did not say Brett’s name. He did not say Paramus in the singsong way he did on television that made old ladies feel they had a host over for tea. He kept his mouth in the room.

It wasn’t a yes. It was a list. They handed it to him like a book he had to memorize before they would discuss the test. If he could get the rescue to agree to a schedule of streaming that would not stress the animal. If he agreed to several layers of signage that used words like never and do not and in no case. If he could demonstrate that the mouth would not encourage children to put their own mouths where mouths should not be. If he would accept that at any time the river could go dark and he could not demand light.

“I can accept that,” he said, surprised to hear how quickly he meant it.

The day had that color of light that pretends to be warmer than it is when he came out, and he walked two blocks as if the distance would take something off him, and then he sat on a bench with a plaque for a woman named Beatrice who had liked pigeons and did not have visitors today. He texted Dina a photo of the list. She wrote back, “I love a list. I want to wrap it around me like a blanket and call it safety.” He texted Talia and she wrote, “I can do the schedule as long as we do not put a camera where a person could trip over it and land in a mouth.” He texted Leah, and she sent him a heart and a photo of a sink at the hospital with a sign that said Foam In/Foam Out in sad font.

He met the camera guy on a Tuesday at ten because the camera guy’s world was in a different sunrise. His name was Sipho, and his voice came through the laptop like weather you respect. He was in a small room under a tin roof that made the rain talk a lot, and the connection faded and returned like a kid in and out of a pool. He had eyes that laughed at the right times and did not laugh when Mason told him what he hoped. Sipho held up a tube that was attached to a black square and said words that made Mason love words more than he had in weeks: low-light, ruggedized, IR dome, solar array, redundancy. He talked about batteries like bodies. He said, “Mud wants to win,” and Mason wrote it down and circled it until the paper got a bruise.

“We will need a small tower,” Sipho said, “but not a tower that says, we make money here. A modest pole. Something that looks like it belongs to birds. People do not like to feel watched by machines when they are already watching an animal. You know?”

“I do,” Mason said, thinking about his own face on televisions in diners where people are already only half looking.

“Also,” Sipho said, checking a sheet of paper with columns that looked like a calendar and a poem, “there are times when the water becomes a private matter. We will cut the feed then. You will pull from other days. I do not make the river perform.”

The budget for the camera and the modest pole and the small box that would send the pictures upward like prayers was enough to make his stomach make an opinion. He forwarded it to Dina, and she wrote back in five minutes with three sponsors she believed could be seduced by the word stream, a plumber, a water company with a commercial that currently featured an otter that had never seen their product, and the county hospital because Leah had promised to invite the person who signs the checks to the room and let her wash her hands publicly in the hippo sinks.

Marjorie had turned into a person who existed in his phone at all hours, like a hurricane alert that says there is nothing to fear precisely because there is so much you will eventually need to fear. She sent him photos of faucets shaped like leaves that were too precious and of a stainless steel basin that looked like it belonged in a spaceship and that she loved because thirteen kids could fight to use it at once and nobody would die. She showed him a sample plaque she wanted to put by the door that read, In Here We Do Not Pretend. He told her yes before he consulted Dina, who would want words that sounded like words you could sponsor. He was learning how many decisions he could make and how many he could let go of until someone else held them. He was learning the difference between holding and hoarding.

Brett called during a segment about a thrift shop that was closing because the landlord had decided he was suddenly in love with artisanal olive oil. He silenced him because he was on camera and also because silencing him while on camera felt like a sacrament. The voicemail was short, the kind that reads like a who you are. “Your little thing is getting bigger,” he said, his voice sweet like a trap that smells like cookies. “Press wants to know if you’re coming to the ribbon-cutting for the youth center. I told them maybe. I told them you had a conflict with the zoo people. Call me.”

He did not call because he could feel in the small of his back the way calling would tilt the week. He went to the youth center and stood at the edge of the guild of microphones and smiled at the kids who knew they were in b-roll and didn’t mind. He let a boy tell him about a mural, and the boy’s hands moved in a way that let you see the wall. He waited to be ambushed by a grin with hair, and Brett did not show because Brett had found another door to walk through and leave Mason staring at the one he had chosen. In the car after, his mother left a message that she had bought a new blouse with shoulder pads because she had always wanted to look like a person who knows where the meeting is, and he promised himself he would take her to a meeting soon, even if it was only a town hall where the chairs complained when you folded them.

Leah called at nine the next night and did not say hello. “He was three months old,” she said, and the pronoun was a weight he felt distinctly. He went quiet and she talked quietly, and the two quiets sat together like old people on a bench. “We stitched. We pumped. We filtered. We did everything you say you want to do. Sometimes the design has a hole you do not see until the day that takes the hole seriously. I sat with his mother after and she told me about his tiny socks and I thought: nothing we do is big enough to hold this.”

He said he was sorry three times because this was one of the times that sorry meant I know you were there while it happened, which is a different kind of grief from the one you have in a kitchen with a glass of water. She told him to keep building a room for sinks. She told him he was allowed to feel small before he tried to feel large again. When he hung up he stood in his own bathroom with the light off and listened to the pipes hide and then release their rivers. He put his hands under the faucet and did not turn it and waited for the muscle memory of water to push air against his palms by mistake.

The county scheduled a public comment night because there are rules and the rules include letting the people who do not leave their houses except to talk talk about the things other people are doing. The room smelled like coffee that had been overruled and cookies that came in packs of ten and tasted like flour plus ten. There was a sign at the door asking everyone to be kind and two men already not being kind in line by the sign. Mason sat next to Marjorie, who had her clipboard and a sweater the color of storms. Dina sat behind them and wrote notes on her thigh with a pen because she had forgotten paper in her rush to remember everything else. Charlotte from the zoo wore a scarf that looked like wisdom and leaned against the back wall like a woman who knows where to stand.

There were the usuals. A man who begins every sentence with As a taxpayer and then says the sentence in a way that suggests he has forgotten what he pays for. A woman who believes that every new project is a gate bent toward her dog. A kid who asked a question that disarmed the room: “Will the water be loud in the room because my brother can’t do loud.” Marjorie wrote down that question and then wrote it in the margin and then wrote it on her hand as if it were a verse.

A man Mason didn’t know stood and ran a finger under a print-out of a story from a website that had turned indignation into a font. He read with relish a headline that suggested Mason had a private plane to Africa and a plan to release crocodiles into the Saddle River for authenticity. He said, “This gentleman plans to bring a wild hippo into Paramus, my cousin works at the pet store and says you need a license to own a parrot, for God’s sake,” and looked around with the smile people use when they have won a laugh for a joke they didn’t write. Mason stood up slowly because he had learned a long time ago that the speed at which you rise gives people permission to clap. He did not ask for permission.

“I don’t,” he said, and his voice did the unexpected thing he still did not trust, which was to make a joke sound like a lesson without being smug. “I am not bringing a hippo here. I am bringing the fact of one here, which is different, and I know the difference because I have learned it from people who have gotten mud on themselves in the right way. I want a room where we can share a screen with a river in another place and think about how we own nothing. We will have sinks. We will have rules. We will have a mouth that cannot bite.”

They murmured, the way rooms murmur when you tell them that you are not stupid and that maybe they aren’t either. Charlotte spoke about the word accreditation with a patience that would have passed a test on patience. A dad stood and said, “My kid likes hippos. He likes trucks too. He’s allowed to like two things.” A woman from the parks department explained that if you let schools book an hour and stagger the buses, you could make a thousand kids wash their hands in a week, which was a metric that made the board member with the pink tie visibly soften.

The vote was not a vote. It was a motion to allow them to present a formal plan to another committee with a rhyming name. It was a nod around a table, two head shakes that were not complete no’s, a comment from a lawyer about indemnification that made Mason write the word on his list of words that sound like liquor but are in fact punishment. After, in the hallway, the man with the print-out shook his head at Mason and said, “I don’t know why you people have to make everything big,” and Mason wanted to say, we aren’t, we’re making a room, we’re making a sink, but he could feel his own spirit get hot and that heat would fog the glass for nothing. He smiled instead and said, “Thanks for coming out,” as if this were a fair and he had just sold him cotton candy by accident.

Brett sent a text after midnight. It was a screenshot of a donation page from a website that had his face up top and a graphic of a river in the banner that was wrong because the water moved like a cartoon. The text on the page said Help Us Bring the World Here, and underneath the button it said, “Partnering with local media to build habitats of understanding.” He tasted metal. He called Dina and woke her up and she said, “Leave it for me,” and he could hear her sit up in the dark and start typing in her head. In the morning her email was already out: “We are not partnering with anyone who crowds a child’s curiosity out of the room. We will show you how to give without being eaten.” Her sentences had the right bite.

He and Owen went to the wastewater plant two days later because it turns out that if you intend to build a room that involves water and children you must visit more places where water goes to be corrected. The foreman was a woman named Jo with a tattoo of a fish on her forearm that moved when she pointed. She wore a hard hat like a crown and told them where to stand so they would not fall into something that would require five forms to get them back out. She loved her pipes as much as anyone he had met loved their work. “People think it’s gross,” she said, pride in her voice like perfume. “Not a lot of them want to see the back of the house. But I’ll tell you a secret: back of the house is where the respect lives. You don’t respect what a thing goes through, you shouldn’t be allowed to use it.”

Owen shot the river of not-river moving under grates and over teeth of metal that chewed and spat in perfect measure. Mason stood in front of the camera and said the word filtration and thought about the other room where Leah would be doing the same, her hands inside a child’s chest where pumps had to be convinced to keep believing. He filmed a line about how many gallons of pulp of life pass through the plant in a day and how none of us write a letter of thanks to the people who make it bearable. When he was done, Jo wiped her hands and said, “So what’s this about the hippo,” with a smile that said she already knew and was testing his version of the story. He told her. She said, “Good,” and then she said, “Don’t cheap it out. Everything rots. Buy the good metal.”

The first test of the mouth happened on a Saturday in a borrowed gym where the floor lines made the animal look like a field. They had commissioned a sculptor with a calm center to build them the mouth from blue foam and then skin it in something that later would be steel and enough cushion. For now it was a blue planet split into two, with teeth gentle as peaches. Kids came because kids always come when you say please and snacks, and they lined up in crooked form and put sneakered feet and light-up shoes into the space. A little boy put both hands on the giant lower gum and closed his eyes as if he had found a church. A girl counted in a voice that loved numbers and said, “Forty. Not counting the little bit ones.” Marjorie stood with a heat gun and softened edges. Dina filmed on her phone and asked a dad if he would sign a release that didn’t cover the world, just this gym.

Mason watched a child put a finger gently against a foam tusk and then pet it the way you pet a thing you might be afraid of and wish you weren’t. He felt something intimate move through the room, a correcting energy, the way a pool corrects a day. Talia showed up like a bird shows when you think of birds, as if she could smell the word river from counties away, and she stood with her arms folded and then unfolded and said, “Okay,” which was her way of saying, you have made a piece of sense.

He went home with the blue dust on his cuffs and brushed it into his sink and watched it collect like sky. He was eating a sandwich over the counter because he had told himself to stop eating over the sink and had managed to move five feet. His phone lit up and he did not pick it up because he had decided to start making the phone wait. It lit again, and he looked, and he did not move for a second because sometimes an image does that to you, pares you into a waiting thing.

It was the test signal from Sipho. There was no subject line. There was only a rectangle that opened when he touched it and gave him a small square of morning that was not his. The light in the square was tea and new. You could hear insects making dictation and the low intention of a bird. The camera was not on Mirella, not yet, it looked across the shape of the water to where reeds thought vertical thoughts and the river made small sentences. Then the water lifted behind the reeds, not large, just a shoulder, a slow blister. An ear. An orbit of sound that meant breath. It was so ordinary that it argued with every stupid word he had said when he was being poetic. It was a head, a small head compared to the idea of the animal, and it was a miracle.

He did not cry. He did that other thing where your face is not sure if it will be asked to be a face much longer and prepares to become only a container. He heard his own breath and thought, Am I making a sound. He touched the counter with his free hand because he had the feeling he should hold something that belonged to his kitchen while he watched something that belonged to a place he would never stand. Mirella blinked. She opened her mouth in a way that revealed dark and then light and then a pink that made him think of cathedrals because maybe he was not done saying that word. She closed it, and her ear did the small shiver you could put in your pocket if you were allowed to keep it, which you are not. Then the feed went to a wider shot, reed, water, a person’s knee and a bottle and a laugh far away.

He sent the clip to no one because he wanted to give himself one hour where the thing belonged only to the muscle between his lungs. Then he sent it to Dina, who wrote back an expletive and then said, “We will never not be live again,” and he sent it to Leah, who sent him the word oh in lowercase, which was the heart he needed, and then a skull because she is a sister. He waited to send it to his mother because he knew she would call him and ask if he needed a jacket where he was going, and he wanted to stay still and not be anywhere for a minute.

The first live test from the rescue was scheduled for a Thursday at ten so that the sun would be in the right place there and at the wrong place here. They set up a screen in the studio and did rehearsals where Owen would switch them from his face to the river and back to Mason’s face without letting the black room get in between. Dina wore a headset and developed a tick where she touched her eyebrow every time she thought, which meant her eyebrow touched itself to death. The county’s streaming portal had new words that Marjorie had written. There was a widget in the corner where people could donate five dollars without getting a certificate that would shame their refrigerator.

On Wednesday Brett posted a video of himself standing on a bridge in a polo shirt the color of boiled chicken and said, “When I say bring the world here, I mean bring it here,” and cross-faded to a rendering of a complex with flags and families and a hippo on a flag because no one had told the designer to stop. The comments were a soup. Mason found himself spooning at it with his thumb, tasting each reply as if it would tell him if he would live. He closed the app and texted Dina a sentence he hadn’t sent often in his life: “Tell me what to do.”

“Do your job,” she wrote. “Be fair. Be very clear. Don’t let his face make you forget your own on live television. Also, get a haircut.”

He went to the barber who had been cutting his hair since his hair agreed to be cut. The barber said, “My wife likes the hippo thing,” and cleaned the back of his neck as if it were a window. He went home and put on the blue tie and took it off and put on another blue tie because the shade of blue had started to carry a weight he didn’t want to admit to. He slept and dreamed of a room that had water in the walls like an aquarium without fish, only light. He woke and his phone was a list. He breathed. He drank coffee that tasted less like pennies because he had descaled, a small victory that pleased him more than reasonable.

At nine-fifty-eight he stood in front of the green screen and did the little rabbit bounce he did when he had to shake the nerves out of his calves. Owen pointed two fingers at him like a man shooting a show into existence with his index. The red light came on. He said, “We’re going to let a river inside our small town this morning,” and felt the studio hear him. He said, “We’re doing it with permission,” because he had learned how to say that, and he said, “We are not the center of the story, but we are a place the story is going to stop for a moment,” and Owen threw the switch.

For a breath the studio was a room that did not make things. The light that arrived had traveled continents and bounced off metal and been argued with by clouds and cached and decoded and still, somehow, it was a light that brought the water to their floor. The sound came not like the ocean but like grammar in the background, insects and breath and the little laughs people make when the job is going well. The comments on the screen below the picture were a scroll of ohs and hearts and a woman who typed MY SON SAYS HELLO MIRELLA in a size that suggested she believed the animal could read a chat.

“Hi,” Mason said to nothing because sometimes talking to nothing is what you do for a living. He said, “We are guests,” and the ear flicked in the corner of the frame and his heart did a small violent thing that made him put a hand on his tie as if to keep it on. He watched the bottle move and the mouth open and the pink that had been designed by no one.

Then the image lifted and shivered and came apart for a second into familiar squares. The sound steadied and then lost language. Owen’s hand hovered over the panel like he was deciding whether or not to catch something falling. A line cut through the picture, diagonal, like a teacher’s correction. The screen went to gray, the kind of gray that is not an absence but a pause. For a long three seconds the studio was their small room again, with lights and wires and the dust of local on every surface. Then the audio returned without the picture, a rushing sound that made Marjorie come to the door of the control room with her clipboard like a shield. In the ear of his head set, Dina said, “We’re good, we’re good,” in the tone people use when they are reminding you to believe them.

The picture came back, off-angle, pointed at reeds only, and a hand—Sipho’s?—entered the frame and patted a cable with the casual authority of a person who touches hungry things on purpose. Mason smiled into the camera because he had to and because he wanted to. He said, “Sometimes rivers do what they want,” and the comments became a sea. His phone in his pocket buzzed, a small insistent insect. He did not check it because he was on air and because there is a discipline to not knowing for a minute. He finished the segment in the room without the river and took a breath and gestured to the weather because that is always the next thing and let Tammy’s graphics roll like a comforter.

In the control room, in the pocket, in the hall, when he finally dug the phone free, there was a message from Talia. No words, just a photo that was not the angle he had seen, closer, in the secret place where pictures go before they become television. Mirella standing in mud like a miracle with a boy next to the fence who had the exact posture of a creature learning to let an impossible thing be near and not step wrong. Talia followed with text as if she had to soften the picture with language: “Flood upstream. Everyone okay. We moved the pole. Your mouth is good. Don’t make the mouth too big. We are all right.”

He put his head against the wall of the hallway the way a tired man does when he cannot find a chair. People moved by him with clipboards and cups, and nobody asked if he was okay because he had made a habit of telling them he always was. He laughed because sometimes laughter is the thing your body does when the room is too full of water and you need to make a spout. He wiped his face with his sleeve. He walked back into the studio and did a segment about a high school senior who could dunk, which was a different kind of miracle, and he made sure to ask the kid who taught him first and to say the coach’s name on air, and when he said the kid’s name he said it like a sentence he had practiced because he had.

On the way home he drove the long way past the empty trampoline park because sometimes ritual helps you pretend choice is a friend. On the roof of the building a banner that had once said OPEN NOW said nothing. He rolled down his window and smelled the plain air that belongs to nobody and everybody. His phone buzzed again as if it had a small need.

It was Brett. “Nice feed,” the text read. “Shame about the glitch. We can fix glitches. You know that, right?”

There was a second text from Leah right under it, as if the phone could feel your blood and make choices. “I watched,” she wrote. “I said oh badly in front of the new guy who thinks surgeons are gods. Keep going. Also the sinks need foot pedals. Children touch too much.”

He texted Brett nothing because sometimes nothing is the sentence. He texted Leah a thank you with the hollow of the k a kind of cave he wanted to sit in. He called his mother at a red light and she said, “I saw you talk to water,” in a voice that made the light of the brake around him seem ceremonial. He went home and fed himself an egg and the egg broke wrong and he did not call it a sign. He sat at his table with the list from the accreditation office and a pen and his own ordinary hand and he put small check marks next to things because he had learned that this was joy too. He opened the video again and let the quiet of the river be the loudest thing in his kitchen and didn’t say hippo out loud once because he did not need to name it to make it exist.Chapter 6

By the next week the river had learned the way to their studio and the town had, improbably, learned the way to the river. Teachers called and asked what days were quietest so that children who didn’t like suddenness could come when the light was soft on the screen. A grandmother wrote a letter longhand with loops as wide as windows to ask if her bridge club could sit in the room and knit while they watched because “we want to see a thing that isn’t ours behave itself.” Dina pinned the letter to the cork board and underlined behave itself in red because it made her want to invent an entire segment called Things That Refuse Behavior. The plumber sponsor delivered a catalog thicker than a cookbook and circled the foot-pedaled sinks with a pen that left grease on the page in a way that convinced Mason this was a blessing. Marjorie grew an email list into a nation. She named the volunteers Riverminders and then pretended she hated the name while secretly making them lanyards.

The first time he met Dr. Bhandari in person she carried a plastic case with a handle and set it on the table like a stage magician setting down a rabbit. In the studio, away from cameras, she clicked the latches and lifted out a tooth wrapped in linen as if it were a christening. It was a lower incisor, unremarkable as an object until she laid its length along his palms and his bones understood weight as a sentence. It was not sharp; it was architecture, a pale pillar with the suggestion of church at the base and something like farm tool in the middle. She watched his face the way doctors watch a pupil for dilation. “It grows like a tusk,” she said. “They sharpen them on one another, a tired marriage making knives. Don’t say that on air unless you have earned it.” He laughed and handed the tooth back and felt the absence in his hands like a new kind of hunger. She talked about water chemistry the way Leah talked about electrolytes, with a tenderness that made math kind. “If you want to sell anything,” Dr. Bhandari said, tucking the tooth back into its house, “sell the fact that miracles are mostly maintenance. People can love that if you teach them how.”

He taught himself how to love it too. He loved Jo’s list of valves in a notebook that had fingerprints in the margins shaped like maps. He loved the email from Sipho’s assistant that said the phrase lightning likes metal and then suggested three ways to humble the pole so the sky wouldn’t notice. He loved looking at the budget and catching himself not flinching at line items called redundancy, which in a certain family signifies failure but here means survival. When someone from a foundation with a name like a lake called and offered half the build if the room would be named for a board member’s investment company, Dina put her phone on speaker and said, “We prefer verbs to investors,” and after a silence that sounded like two people deciding whether to be offended, the caller said, “We can do verbs,” and they did, because sometimes money likes to be told what it is allowed to be.

Brett’s face appeared in the margins of things the way mildew shows up in bathrooms whose vents are lazy. He posted a clip of himself standing in front of the Sussex field that was not his with a drone shot that swooped like a vaudeville bow and a caption that said, “Imagine a family day that teaches your kids to dream big without leaving home,” and in the corner of the render the triple H sat like a little throne. He messaged Mason with a photograph of a check made out to “H.H.H. Friends” in an amount that would make a person’s kidneys tingle. The memo line said for your sinks, which made Mason want to wash the phone. He did not answer because silence had become his most adult word, but the silence came with a cost he paid in jaw pain.

His mother, who had a knack for placing herself next to the thing without stepping in it, called to ask him whether he still had the scarf with the tiny birds because it looked nice on television and also her friend had told her that sometimes pain in the back was nothing and sometimes it was something, and did he remember Dr. Feldman’s first name because she didn’t want to call and say “hello doctor who I do not know.” He told her the name, and he told her he would come with her to the appointment because he could sit in a chair and ask questions as well as anyone, and she said, “You always were good at the chair,” which made his chest heat in a way that made him want to clean something.

He and Marjorie went to the field in Sussex alright, not with Brett but with a map and a thermos of coffee and the kind of bright optimism you pack like sunscreen. The land was lovely like brochures lie, rolling in green with a necklace of water that was mostly reflection. A man with too many belt loops walked them out and talked about viewsheds and enhancers and “experience capture.” When Mason told him that the capture part made his throat itch, the man said, “It’s just a word,” and smiled a realtor’s smile. Marjorie refused to look at him while he wrote and instead looked at the way the wind moved in the ash leaves. “It’s a parade ground,” she said when they were back at the car, “not a room,” and he knew what he knew, which is that there is a difference between spectacle and attention. They returned to their smaller town and went back to the screws and the signs and the foot pedals, and it felt like choosing a garden over fireworks.

The room began to exist the way good things do, with jokes about how heavy the boxes were and tape measure arguments in low voices. Charlotte came with a binder and a small smile that admitted she had been wrong when she had said it could not happen here. Tammy from graphics made stencils that said In Here We Do Not Pretend in a font that begged not to be cute and did not quite succeed. The mouth arrived in two pieces that reminded Mason of a house his friend in kindergarten had made from blue blocks and pretended was a ship. Men and women in shirts that could be mistaken for uniforms lifted the jaw into place, and the hinges sighed like old ladies glad to sit. The inside was painted a kind of inside color and the teeth were pale as the idea of piano. A boy from the high school art club painted a line along the base of the wall that became reeds and then became grasses and then became only uneven green, and if you looked just right you could read in the reeds the words MUD WANTS TO WIN because someone had slipped it in and nobody took it out.

They argued about the sound, because they had promised the boy in the cap and his brother who could not do loud that they would think of him while they made the room. Owen brought in speakers and stood in different corners like a strapping choir and played the river at four different volumes while Marjorie stood with a meter that she bought for twenty dollars and this gave her intense pleasure. They found the level where the water felt like grammar again and promised themselves they would hold that line in the face of donors who would beg for roar. The sinks arrived with foot pedals and a line of small people laid their feet on the pedals and worked them as if breaking in a new prayer, the aerators sending a polite rope of water into the basins that rang like bowls. In ten minutes the donation tally in the corner of the screen turned from pretend numbers to the sort of number that makes a chair rattle a little if you sit on it too hard. “We’re going to afford filters,” Dina said, and then, because she is not one to let sweetness sit in her mouth, she added, “You’re going to have to speak at the rotary and say septic, please do not smile when you say it.”

It wasn’t all a stream. The accreditation list had a line about insurance that made him google words and then call Leah because she understood the way liability sits on a room like a quiet bird. She came to a meeting with a woman from the hospital whose nails were immaculate and whose brain gleamed sharper than they did, and the woman walked through the room and said “risk” in three different dialects. She told them where the wet could creep if they kept the drains thoughtless and told them to put the wipes higher than they thought they needed to because adults were children when it came to wipes. She stood at a sink and washed her hands as if they were a small patient who needed to feel they were being cared for, and Mason watched and understood that he had never really washed his hands in his life, just flirted with water.

Talia FaceTimed into the first staff training, the Riverminders huddled with clipboards and muffins because nothing starts in this county without a pastry. Her face was a square of bright against the wall and her voice was the kind of clear you get when you have had to speak to rooms who think they know more about animals than the animals do. “Speak about her as a thing that will leave you,” she said. “That is the reality. If you let them love the leaving as much as the staying, you will be doing something good. If you make this room a pantry to store her in, you will have made a terrible mistake. We don’t do pantries, we do doors.”

The feeding schedule over the river had moved slightly because rain had made its own plan. Sipho sent him a clip of men dragging the modest pole across mud like a stretcher and texted, “We do not fight water, we date it,” which Mason wanted to tattoo on his boatless chest. The feed hiccuped twice in a way that made his heart practice stopping and then he learned not to let the glitch own the story. They cut to a recorded segment about the false idea of hippos as good swimmers, about buoyancy and walking and how grace is sometimes just good design in slow water, and when the live picture returned it did so with a wobble that felt human. He said the names of the people in the frame into his mic the way he said the names of the sponsors at the end of a show, and it felt like he was doing his job.

Leah showed up on a Tuesday with a scrub top under a jacket and a look that meant she had seen three beginnings and two ends before lunch. She stood in the mouth and put her hand on a tooth and said, “I’m worried I might love this. I’m worried you’ve done something that will make it harder for me to keep my hands where my hands need to be.” He told her the sign-in table had hand sanitizer with a smell that did not offend and that the sinks had foot pedals like she requested, and she nodded with the deep satisfaction of a person whose opinion has transmogrified into metal. They sat on the bench by the door where the plaque that said In Here We Do Not Pretend had finally been screwed into the wall, and she told him about a family that had put stickers on a machine because the stickers made the machine look as harmless as the thing it was pretending to be. “We’re always trying to make it not what it is,” she said. “The success is when you accept that it is what it is and love it anyway. Don’t make cartoon teeth.” He pointed to the mouth and said, “These are the opposite of cartoon teeth,” and she took a photo for her boss with a caption that said, “Outreach, but make it honest.”

At the first soft open a troop of small children in identical t-shirts stood in a loose ellipse like a choir being assembled. Mason watched them from the side the way you watch weather through a window. A kid with a hearing protector the color of highlighter yellow put his hands on the steel lip and let the water sound fill the space around his face and then turned to his aide and gave two quiet thumbs up that looked like review and blessing at once. A teacher whispered a map out loud to another teacher, “We do sinks first, then mouth, then we sit, then we read the sign that says never,” and Mason wanted to hug her. A boy turned a foot pedal as if it were a gas and laughed when the water came steady, and his father said, “It’s like magic,” and the boy corrected him, “No, it’s like a machine,” and Mason clutched that sentence like a coin.

He made his segment that night the way people make soup after a funeral, careful to stir and not announce anything new. He showed the room, and he showed the screen, and he said the word steward without apology. He said, “We are not making a zoo here,” and did not say the names of the people who had sued in his inbox because their parrot had been taken by a girlfriend in 2001 and they had never recovered. He said the plumber’s name, and he said the make of the foot pedal, and he said Sipho because names are how you throw rope over water. Dina cried at her desk in the way of a person whose tears are more salt than theater and then posted the clip, and a woman with three followers wrote “I felt calm for the first time since my divorce,” and Mason read it and sat very still because sometimes small confessions are a bigger award than the acrylic things that gather dust on shelves.

Brett showed up on the fourth day like a seagull from a highway, his hair a flag and a boy at his elbow with a phone already pointed. He put a hand on the frame of the door as if to bless and claim, and Dina eased herself between the hand and the wood with the ease of a person who had been a bouncer for better bars than this. “You can walk through like everybody else,” she said in a voice as sweet as a strand of light but set with hooks. “You can make a donation with the foot pumps. You cannot put your banner on our verbs.” Brett smiled like an oil commercial and said, “I’m here as a citizen,” and Mason said, “Enjoy the sinks,” which in this new life had become both benediction and shiv. He watched Brett step into the room and pale just slightly, that tiny breath people take when the thing in front of them refuses to be entirely held by language. The boy kept filming and panned across the room and caught an old woman’s hands moving under water and Mason thought, you’re going to be surprised which image your people use, you’re going to be surprised which thing you can’t own.

The county called with language about indemnification and the bond that sits like a fat cat on the chest of any public effort. The number was a number that made Dina say, “I need to lay down,” and then not lay down. Charlotte found a man whose whole life was translating risk into yes at a cost less than a kidney. Leah’s hospital made good on its foot pedal money and then added a crib of dollars for the years to come, which came with no plaque, which made Mason love the hospital in a way that stunned him. He went on air and said, “Thank you for your small hands,” and then went home and sat in the dark of his kitchen with the window open to air that knew nothing of any of this and let himself be tired without assigning meaning to the tired.

Talia called on a Tuesday when he was in the supermarket staring at peaches as if they might confess. Her voice had a tone that he recognized from Leah, a low honed calm that tells you the next sentence will require the part of yourself that isn’t theater. “We’re moving her,” she said, and he braced his body on the cart handle which squeaked like a joke. “The river did its thing last week and the next bend is doing its thing this week and the plan is to take her to a larger backwater where she can practice not knowing us. It may be the place where she learns the last thing she has to learn. We may lose the feed for a day or three or ten while we carry poles like old men. I’m telling you so the people in the room will not think their love made the river cruel.”

He felt the cart’s wheel decide it would carry him no further, and he took a breath that put him at the bottom of himself and said, “We’ve been telling them goodbye is the point,” and then, because he had also learned to ask the question that sounded selfish in service to those in his care, he said, “Do we get to see it.” She laughed softly in a way that did not make a sound. “Maybe a tilt,” she said. “Maybe a hand and a sound and a wave that will make your mouth stupid. We are not choreographing her, Mase. We are even less choreographing water. But if there is a way to let your town witness a piece of the world doing the oldest thing it does, I will send you what I can. And if I can’t, then you will have the nicer job, of teaching people to love something they cannot see.”

He went to the register with peaches he did not put in the cart and paid for them because that felt like the adult thing to do, and he carried them home in a bag that tried to tear and felt grateful for the handles because they kept his hands busy while his brain tried to be brave. That night he stood in the room after closing, when only the night cleaning man was pushing a wheel that sang and the mouth in the middle of the floor was just a piece of sculpture and a fight with gravity. He put his palm on the steel lip and it was cold and he said out loud to nobody because nobody sometimes listens best, “I will not make this about me,” and for once he meant it riskless.

He wrote a version of goodbye for the teleprompter that did not use goodbye, and then he wrote another without the word we, and then he deleted both because the sentences felt like people who had put on outfits too early. Dina told him to think of it like a weather report, and he did, and the sentences calmed. He stood with Owen on the morning Talia had circled on texts and they spoke like men who had once narrated parades and now were bringing the lens to the edge of the road. The feed held longer than he had a right to hope, a ribbon of water and reeds and the occasional necessary arm. A body, smaller in the frame than his desire, moved with that density he had come to understand, and then the picture wobbled and he said, “They’re at work,” and then the picture held again and—just for long enough for a person to change the shape of their face—Mirella turned her head to the lens as if to say, I do not care who this is for. There were hands, and the low animal sound that is not a cry so much as air with intention, and then the picture became reeds because that was the time for reeds to be what you look at when you want to watch the thing you love leave.

The room was quiet in the peculiar way rooms can be when the most excitable people have decided to be good. A mother with a baby in a sling pressed her mouth to the baby’s hair and did not breathe in, as if trying to keep the scene in the room with her. Marjorie stood with her list under her arm and didn’t look at it, and you could tell how much love she was emitting by how still she held her clipboard. Mason said, “We are going to step away for the weather,” because the weather is the contract you sign with the clock, and afterward in the hall he pressed his forehead to the cool paint and thought to himself that he had just experienced a sacrament and his only congregation had been Minh the cleaner and three kids on a field trip and a panicless engineer in Botswana whose text came through five minutes later: “Fine. Mud everywhere. Pole alive. She will not wave.”

Brett’s people tried to make the silence into conspiracy, a small spitting article with ellipses where sentences should have been and an image of a crocodile that was not a crocodile but a very deflated pool toy. The comment section did its bloom and Talia texted a line she must have typed with one finger while she balanced a thing heavier than a phone: “Do not feed the thing that eats time,” and he did not. Instead he fed the room. He posted the boring update with a photograph of a sink foot pedal and a sentence about filters that was almost smug and not quite. He went on air and said, “She is doing a thing the book says and the river is being the river,” and then said the names of the three men who had to move the pole and the small stipend they made and where you could send cookies if you wanted to make men in boots happier in a torrential place.

The day after the move, he took his mother to the doctor because she had never liked going into rooms where names are worn on coats. She held his arm like she was helping him and not the other way around, and in the exam room she told the nurse about the sinks as if she were talking about a grandson, and the nurse promised to visit because the sign In Here We Do Not Pretend sounded like church. The doctor said a word that was not new for the country but was new for the part of the body in question, and they made a plan with the coolness of people who had learned to use calendars as weapons. In the parking lot his mother adjusted his collar with her thumb and said, “Do you remember when you cried because the goldfish ate its baby,” and he said he did not and then he did, vividly, the flakes and the light and his own outrage at nature’s choice. “You learned then that the world does not care for your schedule,” she said. “You picked a good job to teach that. Help me into the car, I am going to live until I am ninety just to spite your aunt.”

He brought her to the room on a Tuesday when there were fourth graders and retired men and a couple on their first date too shy to face each other. She stood by the mouth and patted the tooth like a shoulder and then sat with Leah on the bench and criticized his tie in whispers and made a list of the ladies she would bring from her building who needed to be unlonely for the length of a river. Leah watched a boy in a dinosaur sweatshirt pump his feet on the pedal like he was powering a boat and said, “Maybe this is what I meant about the little tubes,” and he said, “You always mean several things at once,” and she said, “That is why I am so exhausting and so useful.”

When the feed came back fully three days later it did so with a view that had shifted left as if someone had decided to frame the world more honestly. In the distance a wild shape loomed that was not a man and not a hippo and not a log, and Sipho’s note said, “Far neighbor, no danger, this is a place where everyone is trying to be water,” and Mason read the note aloud because it was the poem he wanted the town to carry. He learned, again, the practice of showing up and not taking. He learned the pleasure of saying filtration on camera and feeling the town nod because they had learned to love pumps. He learned to get in his car after and take the long way home by the trampoline park that had become a small monument to consequence and think about the difference between jumping and standing and why both should be learned.

When the first grant check arrived in an envelope thick enough to alter the weight of a day, he took it out and held it in both hands and then put it back like he was zipping a sleeping bag around a child. He photocopied it at the machine with the light that swims and then handed it to Dina who said, “No one should have access to this except me and the man with the belt,” and then she laughed, because she trusts almost no one and still shows up every day with a bagel and a plan. He walked into the room and stood in the mouth, and a child came and stood next to him and asked, “Are you the guy who says hippopotamus,” and he said, “Yes,” and the child said, “Good job,” and it was not a certificate but it might as well have been.

That night, with the window a rectangle of temperate dark and his table a map of lists, he drafted the statement he would have to make the day the river asked him to say goodbye properly. He wrote about the shape of a life lived near a thing you cannot own. He wrote about the people who would take the camera down and wash it clean and pretend it had not been crying. He wrote about sinks and pumps and plates of cookies and the quiet knowledge of the boy with the hearing protector who had given him a thumbs up and a new religion. He threw away the first three versions because they sounded like a man trying to be a man, and he settled for the one that sounded like a person with a job.

On the stove a pot of water hissed at a slow boil and he thought of all the water in all the pipes he had not thanked before this month, and he felt his chest do that soft shifting thing Leah calls arranging. He took the pot off the heat and imagined giving it to Jo as an offering, and then laughed because you do not bring a pot to a person with a plant full of pipes. He washed the pot in his sink and counted to twenty and then kept going because it felt good and because he finally liked washing his hands. He stood in the quiet of his apartment and said nothing to no one and loved that the thing he was doing with his days made the air feel like it had a weight he could stand next to. He did not write Brett back, and he did not look at the polls, and he put his phone face down like a man who has learned that quiet is not an enemy.Chapter 8

It turned out that rooms collect names the way cats collect sun. They had promised each other no plaques, no monikers that sounded like a line of athleisure, but people could not stop calling it something when they met at the sinks. The kids called it the Mouth because kids are literal and generous. The retirees called it the Quiet Room because it allowed them an hour in which no one demanded a story they didn’t want to tell. Marjorie, who pretended to hate that she was sentimental, started writing “Wash Room” in her emails as a joke and then not as a joke. Mason tried to never call it any one thing on air. He said, “the room with the sinks” like a charm against meaning too much, and on his legal pad under the list that never ended he wrote: names arrive when you stop fighting them.

He learned the weight of a foot pedal in his palm. Jo came on a Wednesday with a tool bag that had belonged to someone’s uncle and taught him the art of unsqueezing a fitting without unsqueezing the universe. “Don’t torque it like a hero,” she said, and made him hold the wrench with his hand halfway down the handle so his ego would have a harder time showing off. He loved the way the metal admitted defeat, the soft sigh that meant no child would be scalded by the pressure change. He loved, to his surprise, the smell of thread sealant, which sat at the top of his brain in the same place his grandmother’s perfume lived. It felt like the kind of knowledge that, once learned, becomes part of the body. He washed his hands after at the sink with the foot pedal and laughed because the water had the temperature of a thing he had earned.

Brett held a “Family Wild Day” three towns over and mailed flyers to the houses that still allowed flyers to enter their lives. The render showed a hippo larger than a church standing under three flags while a line of white children in perfect shirts pointed with open mouths. The fine print declared “no actual hippos,” and a bullet list promised “water buffalo petting” and “touch-a-gator” that, if you read to the end, became “inflatable gator.” Dina said they should cover it the way they would cover a bake sale—a simple minute, a fact and a goodbye. Mason went because he had promised himself he would not make enemies he hadn’t met, and because he suspected there would be kids who didn’t deserve to be turned into anyone’s B-roll.

It smelled like funnel cake and small ambition. A water buffalo stood with an expression Mason recognized from certain relatives after two hours of brunch, patient and beyond you. A man in a polo explained in a voice that had been rinsed in radio that buffalo were cousins to nothing you could own, and a kid in a dinosaur shirt petted the hide with two fingers and said, “Warm,” with reverence. In the corner, a bouncy house gator sagged in a way that made Mason want to lie down beside it and whisper that it didn’t have to be everything to everyone. Brett arrived fifteen minutes late with a camera and a smile you could hang banners from. He looked at Mason while addressing the crowd, the way boys learn to address a mirror they hate. “This is about bringing the world here,” he said, and a woman near the churro stand yelled, “How much,” which Mason wrote in a notebook the way you copy a poem you will need later.

On air, he said the time, the town, the species in attendance and the sentence “no actual hippos,” and then he said, “Our room doesn’t pet,” and moved on. Dina kissed two fingers and tapped her monitor like a blessing after the segment. “Good,” she said. “You let him hold his own rope.”

The doctor’s office his mother chose had chairs that looked like muffins and a view of a tree that was either trying to be optimistic or stubborn. He went with her because he had promised to be the person who asked, and he learned that his mother had an entirely different set of jokes she told in exam rooms. “My son is trying to adopt a hippopotamus,” she said to the nurse while rolling up her sleeve. “He’s very local.” The doctor was kind in the way of a person who had been trained to deliver severity and had decided, on balance, that kindness did not lessen truth. There was a spot. There was a plan. There was a calendar and words with quiet endings. On the drive home, his mother adjusted the radio until it found a Sinatra and said, “I get to say oncology to Dana in a way that will make her soothe me instead of the other way around. This is my version of winning,” and he laughed and gripped the wheel and thought of Leah’s hands holding the pump that keeps a person’s day in their body.

Mirella’s feed changed in a way that would have broken him a month ago and now felt like a lesson he could teach the room. The camera tilted low, the water rose to the half, the reeds did a lot more of the work. “That’s good,” Dr. Bhandari said when she came to stand inside the mouth for a talk that made people remove their hats. “You should love more reed than hippo. It means you’re becoming people who can wait.” She brought the tooth again and let three children hold it at once and none of them dropped it because some things you know how to balance without practice. On air she said, “We do not keep love,” and Mason didn’t put graphics under that line because sometimes words need to stand in their underwear to work.

Someone left a smear of mud on the plaque that said In Here We Do Not Pretend and stuck a campaign sticker over the first word so that it read Here We Do Not Pretend. It was so artful that part of him admired the vandal’s effort before he hated the mess. Marjorie took off her glasses like a general removing jewelry and handed them to him. “Do not make a post,” she said, already holding a rag and a bottle with a spray top that had seen more indignities than this. “We do not feed. We clean.” Dina in the doorway rolled the thought in her mouth like a jawbreaker and then nodded. “Fine,” she said. “We will quietly zoom on the sink foot and make our donors orgasm.” They cleaned. They did not film themselves cleaning. The sticker came off in a tearful way that reminded Mason of a bandage on a child’s thigh. They put a small paper out for the volunteers that read: If you see mud where it should not be, congratulations you are alive. Also, here is a rag.

Owen told him, sitting on a milk crate in the equipment room between coils of cable that smelled faintly of dust like churches, about a feed he had tried to hold steady from a roof while men did things he would never film again by choice. “You learn,” he said, his hands making a box in the air because muscle memory is strong, “to ride the signal you get and not invent what you think you deserve. You learn that sometimes the cut is mercy. You learn that people think the glitch is their right to be angry when it is actually their way out of being brave.” Mason listened and felt something fundamental recalibrate in him. “You ever regret staying,” he asked, and Owen smiled without teeth. “Staying is where you get the good shots,” he said. “Even here.”

The accreditation people sent a letter in a font that was the bureaucratic cousin of friendly. Provisional approval to continue the stream in a public education context, provided the list was respected and the signs were larger than a child’s foot. No live animals. No suggestion that this was a zoo. It was what they had asked for with their mouths and their principal secret hope under it. Charlotte brought donuts that were somehow the exact temperature of permission and told him he had done the work that made the work possible. Dina stapled the letter to her heart metaphorically and then literally put it under magnets on the break room fridge where old pizza coupons went to be ignored.

The deli man, who had once corrected Mason’s pronunciation of granular like it would save them all, came in late one afternoon with a white envelope he had folded three times and then unfolded and then folded again. “A few of the guys,” he said, name-dropping himself and three men who spent two hours a day and all their best ideas leaning on the corners of counters, “we wanted to give it to the filters. We like the thing with the feet,” and he mimed a pump with his sneaker. The check was for an amount that would not impress a parade but would feed a pump a winter, and it had the deli’s name in shaky script. Mason shook his hand and said, “I will say your last name on television like a prayer,” and the man laughed and said, “Don’t curse, my mother watches.”

Mason did not avoid Brett so much as refuse to give him new rooms. Outside the room one afternoon, Brett leaned against a city tree as if the tree had been put there to hold him. “You could have had it bigger,” he said, as if size were morality, as if showing up slowly were failure. Mason thought of the boy in the hearing protection and said, “We chose water we can clean.” Brett smiled in the way that made people mistake contempt for charm. “Poll’s closing,” Brett said. “You should have my ten minutes next week.” Mason thought of the letter on the fridge and the foot pedals and the checks that came folded and he said, “I’m not giving you ten minutes, Brett. I’m giving you the sink.” Brett blinked, because the sentence did not mean anything until it did, and then he smiled and let it roll off him as if it were water and he were still trying to discover what kind.

They planned the morning of the possible release like a church plans Easter without assuming resurrection. Mason wrote lines that read like weather, and Dinah practiced the cut-away to the map as if the map were a kindness, and Marjorie sent an email to the Riverminders that said: we will be quiet today even if we are not. He bought muffins as if they were talismans and cut fruit because Leah had once yelled at him that men who bring only pastries do not understand blood sugar. Then none of it happened on schedule because the river’s idea of a clock and a man’s are cousins who don’t speak. Talia texted: later, in her shorthand that had unhidden meanings he trusted, and Dina put the tray of fruit in the fridge and Mason laughed because it was so wonderfully ordinary to put grapes back on a shelf when a river had decided to run again too slow.

The release didn’t reveal itself as a moment until it had already started. At eleven-thirteen, after a class of second graders had done a respectful turn at the foot pedals as if revving an engine, the picture widened without anyone touching it. The reeds moved in a schoolteacher way, firm and not unkind. The sound was breath, then more breath, then a noise you don’t hear unless you are near it, the suction of a body letting water go. There were hands in the frame in the way hands appear when they are needed and not looking for credit. The shape they loved did not wave, as promised. It slid, in the slow right way, and then it was just the water making grammar again. One child said “bye,” not loud, not owned, and the room did not clap because no one had told them to or because they had learned not to. Marjorie had the good sense not to cry where anyone could see her and then failed at her good sense in a way that made the room feel allowed. Mason said, “That was it,” into the mic and then didn’t talk for the length of a whole weather report.

After, he went into the hall because sometimes your body needs a wall to agree with it. The phone vibrated. At the top, Leah’s text: that was right, with a heart that was the exact color of curbed blood. Under it, Sipho: alive. He stared at the word until it stopped being abstract and became a fact. He walked back into the room and children were washing their hands because they had been told to, and he thought, I want to learn to obey certain sentences without thinking. He thought, This may be the only applause I will need for a while.

Brett held a press conference at two with flags that clashed with the sky and said the phrase “government capture,” which was a kind of art. His people posted a video with a crocodile in it that was not this hemisphere’s crocodile. Ina in the back room wrote drafts of small blistering replies to glories of nonsense, then put her pen down and wrote, “Our filter needs to be changed next week, can you give me the schedule,” and Mason wrote back, “Yes,” and meant yes to more than the schedule. He did the piece at five with language that borrowed from school. “What you saw today,” he said, looking at a lens he could almost forgive for being glass, “was the world doing its job. We’re doing ours. There will be days with only reeds. There will be days with mud. Our job is to keep the water moving where it should here, and to say their names there.” The comments were a soup that tasted more like soup and less like a fight that night.

His mother’s second appointment had the triumph of a good plan defended in the arena of bad luck. Leah came in with her hospital badge and ate a muffin in the corner, which is what surgeons do when they are not surgeons. They made a list, and they made an appointment, and his mother held his hand and squeezed in time to the elevator music like she was trying to teach him rhythm he had never had. In the parking lot she told him she did not like the word lesion, it sounded like a man who owes you money, and he promised to call it any word she chose as long as she let him drive her on Wednesdays. She said, “I want to come to the room when no one is there and sit with the sink,” and he realized that in his head he had been building the place for everyone but her and this was a mistake he easily corrected.

He took her on a Sunday afternoon when the town napped unknowingly. They sat on the bench under the sign and said very little, which has its own virtuosity. She pressed the foot pedal and watched the water come and go and said, “I like it that it obeys me,” and then, “I like it when it doesn’t,” and he felt the exact shape of what had brought him to build a place like this for strangers and for himself. When they left, she took the long way around the mouth as if walking by a body at a funeral with affection and not with fear. “You’re doing something boring,” she said, “and I’m proud of that,” and he contemplated having that carved into a ring.

They put on a program at the library because the volunteers needed to be fed in a way muffins couldn’t satisfy. Dr. Bhandari brought slides of teeth and startling facts about water chemistry and a sentence about aggression that had less to do with anger than with geometry. Sipho Zoomed in with a background noise of rain that made the patrons look at the ceiling and love him. Jo stood in front of the projector screen where people usually show travel slides and listed the signs of a filter crying and how to stop the crying without making the whole system collapse. Marjorie had a diagram of the room with the arrows pointing in and arrows pointing out and the frame around the arrows that read: We do not fake it. Dina sat in the back and made a list of titles, all of them better than the ones they used.

An older man stood during questions and told a story about a ship that came to Ellis Island with a name, and the man at the desk changed the name to something that fit better in a ledger, and how his father never forgave the paper but still learned to sign it with a flourish. He had tears on his cheeks and an embarrassed handkerchief in his hand and he said, “Thank you for not bringing the thing here while still bringing it here,” and Mason thought, I am never going to explain this job to anyone who has not seen it with their own eyes.

He went home to a kitchen that smelled like garlic because sometimes the world is good on the nose just for the pleasure of it. The machine on the counter hummed like a creature having its own small life, and under the sink there was a bead of water on a joint like a tear. He found the wrench without thinking and tightened with the humility Jo had taught him and the bead reluctantly vanished. He texted Leah a photograph of the now-dry joint because sibling pride is a strange creature, and she sent back a sticker of a surgeon flexing because her sense of humor had never matured past stickers, for which he was grateful. He stood with his palms under the faucet and counted to twenty and then to twenty again because he liked the new math of this life.

At the studio the next morning they did a segment on a quilting club that had started sewing fish and reeds into a giant banner that would hang in the room until someone told them to stop. Owen shot the needles in macro and made the thread look like a river thinking about becoming a road. Dina said yes to an invite she would usually say no to—a rotary breakfast—because she wanted to stand in a room with men who say taxpayer and teach them to say filter. Mason went, he wore the right blue, he did not wear the wrong blue, and he told three jokes that made old men think he was their grandson and then told one sentence that made them respect the way he said mouth. After, a man came up and put a check on the table without looking at him like it was a tip for a good lunch.

The polls behaved like polls behave, which is to say badly. The signs in front of houses multiplied and did not correspond to the faces at the sinks. Brett found a way to be on a bridge every day and to make the bridge seem like a chaplain. Mason found a way to make a plumber seem like a poet and did not apologize for it. The river stayed on their screen, less often now, and then again, in a way that demanded they accept days with nothing but light on water. He learned to love the nothing. He learned to let the sound of insects be the thing he left on in the studio for an hour after they cleared the room, a kind of secular vespers.

A boy came in from a class with a folded piece of paper and asked to give it to the hippo. His teacher explained in a tone that wanted to do no harm that there was no mail slot to the river, but the boy stood with such seriousness that Marjorie took the paper and said, “We have a special place for messages that cannot be delivered.” It turned out to be a Tupperware on a shelf behind the desk. Mason peeked later, shameless in the way of a man who has built a temple and still wants to see the votive prayers. The boy’s letter was ten words, each a planet: I love you. Please be safe. I am trying, too. He put the lid back on and told nobody because some things require no amplification larger than a lid.

He met Talia at the cafe with the plants when she came to deliver the hard news with soft voice. “There will be a white space,” she said, stirring sugar into her coffee with the dignity of a chemist. “She will not be on the feed as much and then at all for a while. She will be learning not to love us,” and Mason, who had prided himself for a decade on staying off obvious sentences, said, “This is the point,” and didn’t feel the need to make it prettier. Talia nodded and told him the names of the new calves that would not be named by the internet, and he wrote them down with the care he gave to sponsors because words and money both ask for the same attention. When they parted at the door she tapped the sign taped to a chair with a plant on it, the one that read “Please don’t sit here.” “You should put that in your room somewhere,” she said, and he laughed and told her they already had—right by the mouth, a small polite request to keep the tooth free of hands, which half the people obeyed and half did not.

He went home past the empty trampoline park because rituals are still rituals even when the excitement has bled out of them. The banner on the roof had finally been taken down, and the blankness where instructions had been felt like a kind of relief. The stadium lights on route 17 made the night look like bones again, and he thought of the sentence he had made months ago about bones and was not embarrassed to be the man who repeats himself when the repetition had earned the right to be true. In his kitchen he turned the faucet on and off, on and off, the way a child might enjoy a switch, except he was testing, except he was learning, except he was loving something that did not know it was being loved.

He said hippo into his own collar like a man who had a secret still, even now that the town had seen his river. The word did not feel like possession anymore; it felt like weather he had learned to predict well enough to carry an umbrella. He put his phone facedown because he had learned to make waiting a discipline and because he knew that when he picked it up the morning would have arrived in another place on earth and a person he cared about would have sent him a line that began with alive, or mud, or fine, and all three were the best words he had come to know. He turned off the light and sat in the dark for a count of ten, and then twenty, and let the water in the pipes hum a little, knowing now what had to be tightened, what had to be replaced, and what had to be allowed to run.Chapter 9

By the time the town admitted to itself that the summer had slipped away, a changeable light slid down the long wall of the room in a way that made the steel of the sinks look briefly like river skin. The kids came with sleeves over their hands and noses pink from their own weather and put their feet on the pedals as if revving their mornings, and the volunteers had started to say “reed” in the same tone they said “rain,” a shared weather everyone could nod at. The feed had become mostly grasses with breath behind them, which was its own species of truth, and it turned out that a room full of reeds and a steady thread of insect grammar could hold a group of second graders in good attention for seven minutes, which, as Marjorie observed in an email she titled nothing sexy, was a civic achievement. There were new signs that weren’t really new, refinements of what they had already learned to say: do not climb the tooth; hands with gloves only; the water is for washing not gulping, even if your mouth wants to feel part of the picture. Mason had begun to recognize the smell of the place as not just soap and wet vinyl but a quieter perfume of metal that had been touched by many cautious hands; it was what he imagined a town would smell like if you could distill collective intention.

His mother’s schedule pinned itself to his days like a benevolent insistence. He learned the nurse’s names in the infusion room without pretending that made him belong, sat with his mother while the pump spoke a steady logic that reminded him of Jo’s catalog of valves, and watched his mother’s bracelets sit obediently on a side table as if good behavior were contagious. Leah was there when she could be and there in the way of people who know which texts to send; she taught their mother how to press her thumb on a small device like a pilot and said sentences about neu­trophils that made Mason nod and not hide that some science still hummed in him as if it had always wanted to be translated into television. In those waiting chairs that try to be chairs and end up being more like assignments, he wrote copy in a notebook that his mother had brought because she does not trust screens to be moral, phrases that tried to take the fever out of longing and put the work back in: there will be days where we will see nothing and still be in the right place; there will be days where we will turn the pedal and the water will come like sense.

Brett did what men like him have always done with rooms they can’t own; he suggested a different one. A candidates’ night appeared on a flyer that used fonts like fists, and within a day someone in his office had called the station and said, with a graciousness that looked nice on paper, that they would be honored if Mason would moderate. Dina slid the invitation across his desk the way you slide bills to a friend you know will pay and rolled her chair back to see if he flinched. “You could,” she said, which in her language meant, you can do this if you do not forget who you are. “If you do, we choose the venue, we choose the lights, and if the word hippo gets put in anybody’s mouth but yours, you have permission to cut the mic.” He told Leah, who made a sound like she was checking a stitch, and she reminded him, “You’re good with unfair weather. You don’t have to make it sunny.”

He chose a school auditorium whose stage had seen its share of recitals and apologies and asked the janitor to leave the house lights a touch too bright because people are less likely to perform when they can see themselves. He wrote rules that were boring on purpose and said them like he was reading a beloved grandmother’s recipe card. On the night, the candidates took their turns at the podium the way men and women take turns at a family table, with a certain defensiveness about the dish they brought. Brett kept looking at Mason while addressing the room, which made a few old men in the front row look at their shoes; he tried twice to turn a question about drainage into a speech about “hunting trips to Africa he’d never take,” and Mason halted him with a raised finger he’d learned on air, polite and unarguable. “We’re staying local,” he said, and the room did the small pleased hum people do when fairness is attempted. A woman in a floral dress whose voice could silence roosters stood and asked in that voice, “Will you fund maintenance before ribbon cuttings,” which was a better question than anything he had in his stack. Brett smiled his smile and said words about leverage; another candidate talked about salt trucks like he loved them more than his own shoes. The night ended without a clip that could be weaponized, which in this town was a small miracle, and as he gathered his papers, Brett leaned too close and said, “You held the rope,” as if this were praise. “I like ropes,” Mason said, and then went to shake the janitor’s hand because it felt important to thank a man for the light.

If the town had needed a reminder that mud wants to win, it got it the following Tuesday when the leftmost sink decided to express itself more fully than anyone had planned. A bead, a bulge, then a warm lace of water down the baseboard set off a chain of small human behaviors that were almost choreography: a Riverminder braced a mop bucket like a midwife, Jo materialized with a wrench and said, “Nobody panic, I’ve been waiting for you,” to the pipe, and Marjorie redeployed foot traffic as if she were at an airport with no planes. They closed the room for an afternoon not because anyone was in danger but because boredom demanded it, posted a note that said: today we learned how to mop together, and put a picture of a rag folded like origami in the corner. The next morning people came with towels because sometimes a town would rather be asked to bring towels than be asked to vote. The tower of folded terry by the door, half floral, half hotel plain, was the prettiest gift pile Mason had seen, ridiculous and perfect, and the plumbers’ sponsor sent a man with hands the size of his face who grinned at the foot pedals as if they were his grandchildren. He tightened a fitting, told them their thread sealant was “an honest choice,” and left smelling faintly of glue and pride.

Sipho arrived on a Thursday when the light had that watery quality that makes parking lots feel kind. He had been flown by a foundation with a name like a lake and a board member who loved verbs, and he walked into the room like a person walking into an idea he had once dared someone to try. He had the kind of face that convinces rooms that they were good to think of this in the first place, and when he put his palm on the steel lip of the mouth he did it with the care of a person who has been hurt by metal and uses that hurt properly. “Your mud,” he said, looking at the shallow tray they had built for the handwashing demonstration where kids could stir and watch sediments settle, “is very clean,” and Jo, who had appeared by his elbow as if conjured by the word, bowed slightly as if a priest had complimented her Latin. He ate a sandwich in the break room and taught Owen a trick for rebalancing a tripod in wind and stood in front of a map and put his finger where the camera was presently arguing with a reed. He said in the library that night, in front of a row of quilted fish and a librarian who had bought a special cardigan to wear to this talk, “We do not make the world come here. We pay attention to how it moves where it is,” which was the closest to a motto any of them had dared to pronounce.

The knock from the accreditation office came in a polite email that felt like the tap of a pencil on a long wooden desk. They would be visiting, of course they would, because provisional does not mean forever, and Mason scrubbed the baseboards with a ferocity that made even Marjorie put a hand on his arm and say, “They are not going to check under your sink at home.” The inspectors were exactly as expected: crisp collars, pens that made a certain noise, and a habit of looking at signs one letter at a time as if their eyes had shutters. Dr. Bhandari met them with the tooth wrapped and unwrapped like a ceremony, Charlotte shadowed them with scarf and good sense, and Mason answered questions at the speed of respect. “No live animals,” he said, perhaps for the five hundredth time in his life, and said it with love. When they asked him why the room didn’t have more of Mirella in it since surely that would “improve engagement,” he said, “Because nothing we build is about ownership,” and one of them let him see a corner of a smile as if to say, fine, you’re allowed. They left behind a letter on letterhead that could be framed and forgotten at the same time, and Dina printed it on thick paper and slid it behind the sink schedule on the bulletin board where mothers wrote notes to each other about playdates and filters and where to find good boots for kids with wide feet.

Election Day put itself on the calendar with its own gravity, and the town behaved like a person pacing in a small apartment. Signs in lawns bloomed in the wrong colors for the leaves, hands were shaken as if hands were a currency, and the deli men argued in a tone that suggested they loved each other enough to fight properly. Dina refused a watch party because she believed in controlling rooms and you can’t control rooms where people bring their own banners, but she let Mason put a carafe of coffee on a folding table by the bench and say, into the camera two hours before the first numbers blinked, “If you need a place where nothing will shout at you for five minutes at a time, the sinks are on.” His mother wanted to go there rather than to anyone’s television, and Leah met them with her hospital badge flipped and the kind of blanket she used to bring to bleachers. They sat, the three of them, while the river did reeds and the kids on a late field trip did foot tap-tap and then went away with hands that were cleaner than they had arrived with. When Mason’s phone finally buzzed in the pocket he’d put it in on purpose and he read the narrow victory for Brett in a tone that didn’t let the consonants sharpen into weapon, his mother made the sound New Yorkers make when the cab doesn’t stop and then adjusted her bracelets as if rolling up her sleeves. “We will see if he learns to change a filter,” she said, and Leah said, “We will make him,” and Mason thought—not for the first time—that the only difference between a family and a town is how many people bring muffins.

The morning after, the campaign office put out a statement about “bringing the world here” that used the photograph of an old woman washing her hands without asking; Dina called and asked them not to do it again in a tone a person uses when they are on a first name basis with good lawyers, and the photograph came down as if it had been tired. Brett himself did not call because winning is a language that makes men quiet for a day, but his people sent an invitation to a breakfast about “Partnerships for Tomorrow,” which Mason forwarded to Charlotte and then to the trash. He worked his list instead, checked the box about the winterization supplies arriving, called Jo to schedule a lesson on heat tape that he approached like a craft, and wrote three notes to small donors who had written their names oddly shy on their checks.

In the downshift of attention that always follows a civic contest, a different kind of attention grew in the room like moss. The boy with the hearing protection came back and took a turn at the welcome desk with a fluorescent lanyard that dwarfed him and said “please” and “thank you” with a formality that made all the old women pat his shoulder and mean it. A girl from the high school brought in a binder full of lamination and offered to make a “word wall” of the new vocabulary the room had taught her—accreditation, turbidity, tussle, redundant—and Mason said yes with the sincerity of a man who loves index cards. The muck tray by the demonstration sink collected fingerprints and silt and three small stones that no one had the heart to throw out, and every night Minh wiped everything down with the same composure he had used since the first day as if all this were perfectly normal, because it was.

Talia called with news that was not new and therefore felt larger. “She’s in the part where we do not see her,” she said, and the line carried the sound of a radio three huts over and a laugh that could have been hers or an egret’s. “We think we have seen the list of everything we can teach. I will let you know if she uses the path in a manner that will make sense to a camera. But mostly, now, it is her. This is what we promise when we say rehab.” He said he understood and didn’t try to give the understanding a metaphor because sometimes metaphors feel like rinsing your mouth when there is someone’s blood on your tongue. After they hung up, he wrote a sentence on his pad—what if this room becomes about watching reeds on purpose—and underlined on purpose until the page looked tattooed.

He made a piece that night with a tone he was still learning, neither elegy nor advertisement, in which he said the names of the people who had held the bottle and built the pole and carried the camera when the bank swallowed shoes. He did not say good-bye because that belonged to someone else, and he did not say hello because he had been saying that all along; he said, “This is the quiet part,” and let the picture do most of the talking, a practice he had avoided his whole career in favor of words. The comments were softer than usual, praise with elbows tucked in, and a man whose username suggested he sold tires asked if there was a way to buy just the filters without the plaque, because he didn’t want one, and Mason sent him a link as if delivering medicine.

On a Thursday, after they had learned to love a week of reeds and a day of rain and an hour where the camera found only sky because someone had leaned a little too hard on a cable and not died, Mason drove his mother to radiation in a car that smelled gently of citrus because he had finally bought the stubborn air freshener the deli man swore by. In the waiting room a woman in a coat the color of jawbreaker candy asked if he was the man from the morning who said hippopotamus without making fun of himself, and he said he was, and she put her hand on his sleeve and said, “Thank you for making something boring into something important,” and he went to the bathroom and stood in a stall and laughed as quietly as he could until the laugh decided to be a sob and then wasn’t.

There was a Saturday when the quilting club hung the banner and the river sound was at the lowest setting they had established for the boy who started it all. The banner, once unfurled, was more than fabric; it was a record of fingers speaking, reeds in stubborn stitches, a hippo in negative space as if the animal were present by what you didn’t fill in. A woman with a thimble on a chain cried in a way that looked familiarly like the way Marjorie tried not to, and Mason taped a small index card to a table and wrote in his neatest handwriting: we will wash our hands and we will wait. In the corner, in the Tupperware for messages that cannot be delivered, ten more notes had arrived, folded politely, a little nation of paper trying to be boats.

Snow threatened the way it does here, like a rumor, and the town talked about salt and school closings and which plow guy takes bribes of coffee. Jo taught him how to drape heat tape around a vulnerable curve as if tucking a baby in, and he held the plug like a promise, and when the first real cold came it did not find a way inside. He sat in his apartment one night, the radiators making their commentary, and put his palms under his faucet and counted to twenty and then didn’t stop counting until he had followed the water to the hallway in his head, down to the fifth floor where a man he called Mr. Newspaper always left the Sunday paper on the ledge, into the street where ice would scare older women, into the plant where Jo understood every rattle, and then, as ever, back to a river that had learned not to miss them. He did not write to Brett, and when Brett wrote to him to ask for ten minutes in the next week’s show, he sent back a sentence that had cost him months to be able to type: “Come wash your hands.” He went to bed with the word done not as a trumpet but as a tool, and he put it in the drawer where he keeps wrenches and waited for the morning like a person who has built something boring and found it difficult and worth it.
