     "novel_text": "The morning the gulls learned my name, the Auckland sky was the colour of cold butter, and my kitchen window had the kind of condensation that makes everything beyond it blur into a kinder world. Steam curled from the pot where passionfruit pulp simmered and popped; a yellow riot turning itself into curd while the radio whispered news about delays on the motorway and a ferry that had left without someone important on it. I hummed a few bars of something I didn\u2019t know, tapping my spoon against the lip of the saucepan\u2014one, two, three\u2014and then checked the temperature again as if I could will it into place by staring.\n\nThe stove ran slightly hot, a fact that mattered to me more than it should. The curd thickened like it had been waiting for my attention all along, so I drew the pot off the heat and whisked in the butter. It was a slow bright spell of stirring, the kind that holds my head above water. I had a feeling the gulls across the street could smell sugar when the day was still deciding itself. They shrieked and flapped past the lamppost where flyers curled damply, where kids had taped an ad for a missing skateboard and a flatmate who didn\u2019t mind cats.\n\nMy flatmate, Kahu, padded in barefoot, hair springing into the sort of halo that defies gravity and fashion. He stretched, yawned, then flinched theatrically as the smell hit him.\n\n\u201cDamn, Nia, that\u2019s criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to anger the weather gods with something that good this early.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them come,\u201d I said, and tried not to grin. \u201cWant some on toast?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t. I absolutely should.\u201d He held out a plate, and I swiped a spoonful of curd onto the heel of a slice. He bit it, eyes rolling back. \u201cKiller. Sweet as. What\u2019s the occasion? Don\u2019t tell me\u2014just a Wednesday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Tuesday,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, there it is. The twinkle.\u201d He leaned against the benchtop, cocked a hip. \u201cIs this plan called \u2018inventing breakfast\u2019 or \u2018beating a bunch of very nice television people with your whisk\u2019?\u201d\n\nHeat crept up my neck. I liked that my friends were merciless; I liked it more than anything, in secret. \u201cBoth. Neither,\u201d I said. \u201cMrs. Healy is coming down from the hospice this afternoon. She claims to be bringing coconut.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour hospice gang is more exciting than my thesis committee.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s more exciting than your thesis committee.\u201d I scraped the last of the curd into a jar and pressed clingfilm onto its skin. Across the street, the gulls played something that sounded like laughter. \u201cDid your car start this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now,\u201d he said, wincing. \u201cShe coughed like a chain-smoker but she got there. I\u2019m taking her to Tasi this week. He\u2019ll yell at her and she\u2019ll straighten herself out, like me after my mother rings.\u201d\n\n\u201cTasi is a miracle worker,\u201d I said. \u201cCherry could use a stern talking-to as well.\u201d\n\nCherry was not so much a car as a stubborn red blister on wheels, a 2002 Mazda with a cracked dashboard and a temper. The back left window didn\u2019t roll down anymore, the radio sometimes sang only in static, and the passenger door required you to push it with both hands to close. But she had been mine since the summer I turned nineteen and scraped together enough from coffee shop tips and selling muffins at the markets, so maybe she lived on out of pure loyalty.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking Cherry to Tasi, too?\u201d Kahu asked. \u201cWhen\u2019s your next shoot? You told me yesterday and I forget. My brain is oatmeal.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo shoots,\u201d I said, though my voice didn\u2019t sound like mine for half a breath. \u201cThere\u2019s no next. I mean\u2014there is. But not like that. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWaiting,\u201d he repeated, drawing the word into something silly and significant. \u201cFor a call.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor an email,\u201d I said. \u201cThey always email before they call.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd do you have your phone volume up? Because if it\u2019s not loud enough, the email fairies can\u2019t get through.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have that lucky spoon you said you would never ever wash again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWashed it last night,\u201d I admitted. \u201cAccidents happen.\u201d\n\nHe put a hand to his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re a braver woman than I. Okay, I\u2019m off to prostrate myself in front of the gods of grading. Kai later?\u201d\n\n\u201cLater,\u201d I said, and listened to him throw a hoodie over his head, trip on the mat at the door, bark a laugh at himself, and gone. The apartment exhaled with him. The curd cooled. The radio man said something about a painter whose works were found in a thrift store for three dollars. The day began again.\n\nWhen my phone chimed\u2014just an email, just a ping\u2014the spoon in my hand knocked the counter. It was ridiculous, the freefall in my chest, the way the world narrowed to a crackling rectangle of glass. The sender line said what I knew it would: Production. The subject line was as simple as a heartbeat.\n\nWe would love to see you in the final, if you\u2019re willing.\n\nI had not known how much I was braced for a different sentence until then. I read it once, twice, a dozen times; I read it out loud to the kettle, to the sticky ring of sugar on the stovetop. The little black letters did not rearrange themselves into anything else. They were themselves, which meant I was a person standing in a crumby kitchen in Mount Roskill who had just been asked to step inside a white tent where flour behaved like confetti and somebody\u2019s grandmother was watching me through a television screen, thinking, Girl, try the lemon zest.\n\nI pressed my palms flat on the counter as if I could steady the world by pinning it down. My phone chimed again: a follow-up with the schedule, the list of requirements, the little hiragana of what lenses we were on and what we were to bring. And there, at the end, as casual as you like: Please drive to the location by 6:45 a.m. sharp. Directions attached.\n\nI laughed, the kind that noses against a sob. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me,\u201d I told the email. \u201cYou can and you did.\u201d\n\nI should have called Kahu back but picked Lena instead. She was at the caf\u00e9 in Eden Terrace by seven most days; we\u2019d worked together for years and held each other up through long shifts, through the summer a pipe burst and turned our backroom into a swamp, through my first episode where my hands shook so hard I thought the camera would catch me out. She answered on the second ring.\n\n\u201cNia. I was about to burn a batch of banana bread for you. You stopped me in the nick of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always put too much cinnamon in it,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s slander. You love my cinnamon. What\u2019s wrong? Your voice is strange.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey emailed,\u201d I said, and the smile split my face. \u201cThey want me in the final.\u201d\n\nThere was a noise in my ear that could have been Lena squealing or the coffee machine pitching a fit. \u201cYou\u2014what\u2014holy\u2014Nia. Oh my god. I knew it. I knew it. Of course. You\u2019re gonna be on the telly again, in the last one? The big one? Do you need me to come over there and fan you with a baking sheet?\u201d\n\n\u201cGas oven tray,\u201d I said, breathless. \u201cKahu says it has more surface area.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to Kahu, he\u2019s wise. I\u2019m making a chocolate roulade right this second and it\u2019s going to dance for you. And you\u2019re going to make\u2014what are you going to make? You can\u2019t tell me, can you. Because they\u2019ll sue you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell you some. They want a showstopper that tells a story,\u201d I said softly, like speaking it could shatter it. \u201cAnd a technical where we all cry. And a signature where I\u2019ll probably cut myself and pretend like I meant to. Or burn the sugar into a new element.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always say that and then you pull something out of yourself like it\u2019s been there since you were small.\u201d\n\nI was small once, smaller than I like to admit. In those days, before I knew proper ovens or the name for a soft peak or the patience to wait for butter to soften on its own, I baked in microwaves, in toaster ovens, in a cracked communal oven that devoured cookies and spit out grit with a grin. The home in Avondale had six of us then: two girls who braided my hair too tight, a boy who spoke only in hotspots of silence, a couple who loved each other in a way that made the whole house tilt. Renee was the house manager, a woman with hands that never stopped moving. She baked the way my mother might have\u2014I never knew; I don\u2019t guess out loud\u2014but there were scones that made everything warmer than it had been before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make something for her,\u201d I said now, into Lena\u2019s ear and also into the bigger listening space my life had become. \u201cFor Renee. For me. There\u2019ll be feijoa. Everyone will hate it except me.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone loves feijoa, shut up. I\u2019ll start stockpiling fruit. Hey. Proud of you. Proper proud. I\u2019d hug you but that would involve leaving the machine and then the world might stop, so I\u2019ll hold it for later.\u201d\n\nThe world did not stop. It changed angles. I poured coffee into the chipped mug with the fading picture of the Sky Tower, the one I\u2019d rescued from a box at the community centre because it felt like a talisman against the bigness of the city and the ache of being alone in it. I set the mug next to the jar of curd and, like a madwoman, opened the email again. They were filming the final in a vineyard outside Matakana. I knew the place; we\u2019d driven past on a school trip once, the vines held in neat tight rows like someone who had smoothed a hand over the earth. It would mean taking the motorway north, past Onewa Road where the trees showed their roots after a storm, the bridge arching like it was used to carrying much heavier stories than me. I tried to picture Cherry making it, her laugh of an engine keeping up. I could do it. I had done much harder things. Right?\n\nRight, I told myself, and the word had a wobble.\n\nBy midday I had told the people who would either show up with flowers or with the right kind of silence. Kahu blew me a kiss from the doorframe; Lena sent a picture of herself holding a piping bag like a dagger. Mrs. Healy messaged a long row of heart emojis that looked like a flock of odd birds. I made lunch I could not taste and, later, went to the hospice with two boxes: one for the staff, one for the women who helped me understand grief as a kind of second language. The hospice smelled like lemon hand gel and hope. The windows framed an ordinary blue day that seemed aware of itself, and the kitchen was blessedly empty save for the low hum of an overfed fridge.\n\n\u201cHallo, sweetheart,\u201d said Mrs. Healy, coming in with her stick thumping politely. She was tall and sharp and would not have looked out of place warning sailors about rocks. \u201cYou\u2019ve brought sun.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust curd,\u201d I said, and set the jar on the counter like an offering. \u201cAnd some little shortbreads. How are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cFull of mischief and pills,\u201d she said. \u201cI went hard at physiotherapy and now I can raise my arm like this.\u201d She lifted it to shoulder height and winced with triumph. \u201cTonight I will reach a little higher. And you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey asked me to be in the final,\u201d I said. The words had begun to fit my mouth.\n\nShe peered at me over the top of her glasses. \u201cMy pretty girl,\u201d she said, satisfied. \u201cOf course they did.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Healy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, I know, looks aren\u2019t everything, but a pretty girl is a girl who is loved. And you are that now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t always.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you are now is what you are,\u201d she said, in a voice that belonged to both our mothers. She reached out and pinched my cheek, very lightly. \u201cYou are going to make those judges weep. Are you bringing your notebook? Are you bringing a plan? Are you going to remember to eat? Don\u2019t get thin on me. You always try to get thin when you get nervous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never try,\u201d I said. \u201cIt happens by accident. But I brought two sandwiches today.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmart,\u201d she said, clearly pleased. Then softer: \u201cI won\u2019t see it, you know. You\u2019ll have to tell me. When they announce it, when you stand there, give me the story. You\u2019re my eyes.\u201d\n\nI swallowed. We didn\u2019t say the rest aloud. Coco, the nurse with lavender on her wrists, drifted in and leaned against the counter, eyes bright.\n\n\u201cIs it true? Did you make it?\u201d she asked me. \u201cLily said she saw you in the paper last week and they were calling you \u2018our Auckland hopeful\u2019. I told her, Nah, she\u2019s our hopeful.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I made it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGirl, you\u2019re going to be world famous in Ponsonby,\u201d Coco said. \u201cPut me down for a pack of your biscotti now. When you get your own bakery and you forget the rest of us, I\u2019m going to show up with this spoon and bang on the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a key,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd your own seat.\u201d\n\nIt was a good afternoon. The ladies of the Tuesday knitting group tasted the curd with the reverence given to manna and then critiqued it with the ferocity given to injustice. Too sharp, said Nora; not sharp enough, said Lily; just right, said Mrs. Healy, because she knew when to back me and when to push. I brought out a second jar and a third, things I had not planned to make but somehow had on hand because that\u2019s the sort of person I am when I\u2019m afraid. We talked recipes and pronkt with the yarn, all of it, and when I walked back into the slightly cooler evening, my heart had found a place to stand where it didn\u2019t shake.\n\nOn the way home, Cherry rattled like someone with a secret. At the lights on Dominion Road, she coughed once, then twice, like a warning. I patted the steering wheel and talked to her like a horse. \u201cNot yet,\u201d I said. \u201cWait for me. I\u2019m almost there.\u201d\n\nThe email had attached directions to the vineyard; I printed them at the library, because paper settles me, because the act of folding it twice and tucking it beneath a magnet on my fridge made the world real. I put asterisks next to the lines about showstopper notes and labelled plastic containers. I wrote a list on the back:\n\n- candied feijoa peel\n- puff pastry test batch #3\n- new piping nozzles, maybe the leaf one?\n- call Tasi for cherry\n\nI wrote cherry, lowercase, like a fruit. Then I crossed it out and wrote Cherry, like a promise.\n\nI practiced. I practiced until the apartment smelled like sugar, burned and redeemed, until the floor was a white map of mistakes, until my fingers were blistered from the whisk and I was talking to myself, which is to say, I was talking to Renee. She used to say, \u201cIt\u2019s all in the wrist, baby,\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t you dare throw that batch away\u2014there are no saints who aren\u2019t sinners first,\u201d and I could hear her voice now\u2014smoke(d) and honey\u2014holding up the edges of me. I made a rough sketch of a croquembouche disguised as a pohutukawa tree, then threw the sketch away on account of madness. I test-drove a lamington sponge so light it forgave me for everything I\u2019d done to it. I folded feijoa into cream and sugar and the memory of summer. When the curd ran away from me, I coaxed it back. When the caramel seized, I ignored the camera in my head and swore, quietly, then louder, then with relief.\n\nOn the third day, with my kitchen turned into a full armed conflict between flour and sanity, Kahu stuck his head around the door, blinked, and said, \u201cEver thought of opening an industrial bakery and moving your bed in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an option,\u201d I said, hair anchored with a tea towel. \u201cI\u2019m making four things at once. It\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a lie or a sacred chant.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and then, because he looked at me gently, I let the secret out. \u201cSometimes I think, if I win, it changes everything. And if I don\u2019t, it changes nothing. And both of those are frightening.\u201d\n\nKahu came in, stepping around a saucepan like it was a small animal with teeth. \u201cTell me your other fear, the one you\u2019re not saying,\u201d he said.\n\nI ran water over my fingers, watched the sugar dissolve. \u201cDriving,\u201d I said. \u201cOn the day. It\u2019ll be early. There\u2019s the bridge, and the motorway, and the thought keeps gnawing. What if Cherry decides to throw a fit. What if I\u2019m late and they throw me out and that\u2019s the story I tell for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be early,\u201d he said, like it was a blessing. \u201cWe\u2019ll take Cherry to Tasi on Friday. He\u2019ll do the thing with the screwdriver and the swearing, and she\u2019ll purr. Don\u2019t look at me like that. Trust him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cI just\u2014money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little. You\u2019ve got a lot of cake. We\u2019ll start a black market in shortbread. Also, I know your secret fans. They\u2019ll pay whatever you tell them to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have fans,\u201d I said, and we laughed until it was true.\n\nLater, alone, I stood at the sink with the window open to the evening and watched a bus hum past, yellow seats bobbing with passengers. A couple on the sidewalk argued softly but kept their hands stitched together by a finger. The sky went belly-up salmon pink. I had the impulse to call Jules, which scared me because of what it meant. Jules had been in the tent with me once, early, the episode where we made things that melted if you looked at them sideways. They were from Christchurch, they wore bracelets their little sister had made, and they had a way of swearing with tenderness that settled me down. We had not been allowed to be friends in the way that lasts; rules and timing stole that from us. But after the episode aired, we\u2019d called anyway. And then sometimes, when the weight lay across my chest like a cat refusing to move, I\u2019d call and they\u2019d pick up and talk about nothing until it shifted.\n\nI pressed their name with my thumb; when they answered, their voice landed in my ear like a hand on my arm.\n\n\u201cHey, baker,\u201d Jules said. \u201cHow\u2019s the world of butter and tears?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey asked me to the final,\u201d I said. It still felt like a dare when I said it.\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re obscene,\u201d Jules said, without missing a beat. \u201cI mean that in a nice way. Congratulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I shifted the phone to the other side. \u201cI\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll mess the lamingtons. How embarrassing would that be.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo embarrassing,\u201d they said solemnly. \u201cI mean, you\u2019d have to move to Australia. Witness protection. It\u2019s over for you.\u201d\n\nI snorted. \u201cWow, thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to make something that tastes like the first lemonade you ever drank in summer,\u201d Jules said, gentler. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be annoying about it. And then you\u2019re going to call me afterward, and we\u2019re going to debrief on who cried and what jokes the hosts made that didn\u2019t land. And if you don\u2019t win\u2014listen to me now\u2014if you don\u2019t, we\u2019re still going to do that. Okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou have your list?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich one? I\u2019ve got about seven.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one with the practical shit. Petrol, spare tyre, snacks, Spotify playlist labelled \u2018don\u2019t cry on the bridge\u2019.\u201d\n\nI looked at my fridge where a magnet held my paper life together. \u201cWorking on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWork faster,\u201d they said. \u201cYou can control that. The rest\u2014nope. That\u2019s for ghosts and editors. You\u2019re too alive for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you to be this kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a menace,\u201d they said. \u201cGo sleep. The secret is sleep.\u201d\n\nThe secret had always been sleep, and there had always been not enough of it. I dreamed of butter melting in my hands and woke to my pillow being too warm. I put on old sneakers and ran down to the dairy on the corner in the dim half-light, bought milk and eggs and bananas and let Mr. Singh tell me about the cricket as if the score mattered to the sugar in my veins. On the way back, my phone buzzed again with a text from Production with more instructions and a caution about the early start and a reminder to bring ID and a smile. The smile I could do. The ID I could find. The rest of it, I would hold like a bowl full to the lip, steadying each move.\n\nFriday came, and with it a sky like steel and the thin threat of rain. Kahu drove with me to Tasi\u2019s garage in Sandringham, the one with the painted mural of a sea turtle on the roller door and a bench made from old tyres. Fa\u2019amasino was his last name, Tasi what everyone called him because he was the first son and carried that with a grin that could turn a wrench. He had been fixing everyone\u2019s car since the nineties and was the only person I\u2019d ever seen talk a radiator into behaving.\n\n\u201cNi sa bula, sis,\u201d he said, when I rolled Cherry in. \u201cShe\u2019s still red? Good. Red cars never quit, they just sulk.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a little cough,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s... I\u2019ve got to drive to Matakana.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me and then at the car and then at me again, and his eyebrows did the exact thing that meant he wasn\u2019t going to make me feel bad about money. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure she sings,\u201d he said. \u201cLeave her with me. You go get a pie. You look like a broom.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolite,\u201d I told him. \u201cThank you. Don\u2019t let her forget me.\u201d\n\nHe patted the bonnet. \u201cShe knows your hand. Go on.\u201d\n\nWe waited in the little office that smelled like oil and corrugated iron and coffee burned until it came good. There were magazines about boats and men in shorts, and a calendar with kittens in hard hats, and a sign that said No we do not fix computers. Kahu tapped a rhythm on the arm of the chair. I pretended to read worth less nothing of a brochure on windscreen replacements and watched the rain decide, then not decide, then fall.\n\nTasi came back out with a rag over his shoulder and a look that said he had found something and he wasn\u2019t going to be alarmed about it. \u201cYour girl\u2019s got a worn belt and a battery keen to retire,\u201d he said. \u201cNeeds tender love and a little cash. How deep\u2019s your love?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do the belt,\u201d I said, before I could stop myself, because poor and proud are cousins. \u201cThe battery\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t bake on the side of the road,\u201d he said, not unkind. \u201cYou need both. Lucky for you, I like lamingtons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring you six dozen,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThree,\u201d he said, smug. \u201cAnd a loaf of whatever that bread is that smells like angels.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrioche,\u201d Kahu supplied. \u201cShe makes the price of property rise when she bakes it.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsider it done,\u201d I said.\n\nWe bartered until I felt stupid and then steady again. Tasi called me girl twice and sister once; it is the kind of love I can stand. I left Cherry there with a kiss to the steering wheel and walked home in the drizzle with Kahu\u2019s umbrella handle hooked over my wrist. The day had a chill through it; the air smelled like rain on tarmac and damp jacaranda. My shoes squelched. A gull escorted us for a block and then gave up.\n\nThe apartment was a set of lists. I lay them out on the table and picked them up, one by one, like cards in a game where the stakes were not my life and also were. I placed bowls where I would want them, as if I could practice the final from a distance, as if my hands could learn without the heat or the eyes on them. The truth is, the tent had felt like home. I had flour on my lips and butter in my hair and a silly smile I couldn\u2019t not wear, and the producers had moved like careful moths around us, trying not to startle anything. I had learned the rhythm of the jokes and the tap of the judges\u2019 shoes. I had learned to breathe when the timer sounded like it was mocking me. I was ready\u2014except for the parts of me that never would be. Which is to say: the parts of me that had lived through late nights counting chairs in the community centre to make rent; the parts of me that had sat in the kitchens of houses that were not mine and learned to wipe counters so I could stay; the parts of me that, when I am honest, still flinch at sudden kindness as if from a blow.\n\nWhen I couldn\u2019t bake anymore, I went down to the water. It was what I do when my head buzzes, when the city feels like a jar with the lid screwed on too tight. At Devonport, the wind tried to jam itself into my ears, and the sea held the shore in its mouth, and people who weren\u2019t me walked past very alive. A couple took wedding photos and then looked like children who had been dressed up by their mothers. The ferry churned up a long ribbon of white that wrinkled the blue. I told the sea the same thing I always tell it: that I am small, that I am afraid of disappearing, that I am also, stubbornly, something like a woman made of eggs and sugar and heat.\n\nWhen I got home, there was a note under my door, in a spidery hand that nearly fell off the page with the effort of being read:\n\nMuffin girl\u2014don\u2019t make those fancy people forget where you came from. Make one thing that tastes like an afternoon on the back steps. And if you need a ride, say so. We don\u2019t have to be proud all the time. \u2014Mrs. Kline, 3B.\n\nMrs. Kline was ninety if she was a day and had a cat named Beethoven who hated everyone but me because once I fed him a little sliver of ham. She took the stairs one at a time and died in my nightmares, but for now she lived in a world where she crocheted covers for kettles and put her hand through my open window to leave me notes.\n\nI put the note on my fridge next to the directions. In case of literal disaster, she had written, in smaller letters. Phone me.\n\nCherry came back to me the following afternoon, purring like a cat after cream. I drove her around the block and then around the next one and then as far as Onehunga and back just to feel the motor stretch, line by line. I filled her tank. I vacuumed the crumbs under the driver\u2019s seat and found a bobby pin I\u2019d lost and two dollars. I put a little square of old towel on the dashboard so I could rest my phone there for the directions, like a ninety-year-old, like the child I was. On the morning before the final, I put my hands on Cherry\u2019s hood and said thank you, because I have learned to thank things I expect to hold me.\n\nThe last night before, I slept. Properly. The sort of sleep that arrives like a friend on a warm afternoon and insists you lie down on the couch with your feet tucked under and your eyes turned to a place where light leaks through your closed lids. Morning came cool and clean. I stood under the shower until the hot water sighed its last. I pulled on jeans and a T-shirt and a light jumper and tied my hair up and down three times and settled on up, because of cameras, because of the relentlessness of the wind at Matakana. I ate two slices of toast and half a banana and could not remember if either had tasted of anything. I checked my lists. I put the spare tyre on my list though it was already in the boot. I kissed the magnet that held the directions on my fridge and did a stupid little dance at the door because there was no one to see me and because my body needed to celebrate something, anything.\n\nThe city at five was not my city. It belonged to men in high-vis vests and women in quiet shoes walking dogs that glowed under the streetlights. The motorway sighed. The gulls were asleep. The radio played a song that promised me I was not alone and then forgot me immediately. I drove the way you do when you are not sure if you have permission; I touched my shoulder to check the seatbelt out of an old superstition; I whispered the names of exits like a prayer.\n\nA few minutes before six, my phone vibrated on the towel where it sat. I glanced down. Production had texted: See you soon! Coffee is hot. The tent is a dream. Drive safe.\n\nI put the phone face down. I breathed. I could do this. The bridge rose up ahead like a spine. The harbor unrolled itself like a sheet behind. I tightened my grip on the wheel until my knuckles had their own ideas, and I sang, badly, on purpose, the song my mother never sang me, the one that goes, You are your own home. I believed it. I tried to.\n\nThere were so many ways to tell this story. There was the version where I delivered on the promise of the girl in the paper. There was the version where I made small neat mistakes and smiled and no one noticed and the world kept turning and later we ate cake on the couch and laughed. There was the version where I didn\u2019t make it at all. There were so many roads.\n\nI took the one that was in front of me. I breathed in between each exit, in between each flicker of taillight, in between the billboards that told me to be a better person and buy a better vacuum and remember my insurance renewal. The sky was pink again, but this time there was a bruise of cloud in the west, and I tried to convince my heart it wasn\u2019t an omen, just water where the light hadn\u2019t got yet. On Onewa, the trees held their roots quiet under the earth; on Constellation, a bus hissed like it had relieved itself; on Oteha, a sign told me to slow down for some reason or other and I did.\n\nWhen the motorway opened out into the stretch that takes you north of the city, where the hills roll like lazy seals and the sea can\u2019t quite make up its mind to come closer, Cherry hummed a steady rhyme. I patted the dashboard once, twice, three times\u2014one for luck, one for old times, one for Mrs. Healy. The sun came up clean. For a breath, I forgot my mouth was dry.\n\nYou\u2019d think, if the world were kind or at least consistent, that would be the end of it, the simple little start of a morning that would file itself under Nice Days. You\u2019d think the yellow cone of light on the road was some sort of blessing, and the radio talking about bees was a sign that sweetness had a plan. In another telling, maybe it was. In the one that happened, I breathed, I drove, I thought of dough and hands and heat and faces I loved, and I felt the very faintest stutter under my foot that could have been nothing and could have been the beginning of everything. I told myself not yet, not yet, not yet.\n\nI drove on. I drove as if the story remembered how to be kind. I drove into a day that had teeth and laughter both, and my hands on the wheel were steady enough to convince me that I belonged to myself, which is all any of us ever get. I drove toward the white tent, and to the place I had made for myself, and if I was also driving toward a crack in the road where the whole thing might catch\u2014well.\n\nWhoever said being an orphan means you don\u2019t have a family never ate cake on this island. We make our families out of sugar and salt and the messy way we show up at each other\u2019s doors. That morning, with the sun lifting and the road obliging and my heart behaving for once, I believed it with a ferocity that warmed my skin. I believed in flour as an instruction manual for resurrection. I believed in the church of kitchens and the prayer of a well-timed timer. I believed in my hands.\n\nAnd before the day was over, I would need all of that belief, the whole basket of it, stacked high and leaning, wobbling but refusing to fall. For now, the curd sat in its jars. For now, the women at the hospice slept or didn\u2019t. For now, the city shrugged on its jacket. For now\u2014still\u2014there was this bright line of road. I took it, and the gulls, if they watched me from their lamppost councils, squawked like my name was made of sugar and salt and something hard as bone.Chapter 3\n\nThe motorway unspooled like ribbon from a gift you open too slowly, and I kept my hands where they had learned to be, thumbs light, shoulders down, jaw unclenched by force. Dawn did that shy trick where it pretends not to have been planning this all night, and the dark let go of the edges of the hills in stages. Trucks moved like deliberate animals, their taillights blinking a language I had almost learned. I had been a passenger most of my childhood, and then for a long time a walker, and then briefly the kind of girl who thought buses were a kind of moving church because they delivered you somewhere that was not where you started. When I finally learned to drive, it was in a parking lot behind a decommissioned video store, with a volunteer named Mike who smelled like peppermint and had one good joke about parallel parking he refused to ruin by explaining. He taught me to breathe through the merges, to look where I wanted to go instead of where I was afraid I might end up, to trust my hands the way I trusted a whisk. I remembered him now when the lane split at Oteha and I chose the right-hand fork, the one that would take me to a day I had imagined like a cathedral.\n\nCherry\u2019s little stutter returned once, then thought better of becoming an incident, and flattened out into a hum that steadied me more than the coffee I had only half-finished. The new stretch of motorway rippled under us, and I could feel where the tar had been hot enough to smell new last summer. A sign with cheerful green letters pointed toward P\u016bhoi, and then Warkworth, and the smaller white sign beneath it whispered Matakana in letters that felt familiar enough to be a promise. The radio told me about bees and then about a finance minister I had no feelings left for, and then\u2014it could have been coincidence\u2014played a song my mother never played, a lullaby disguised as pop, and I let myself sing long low notes on the vowels because sometimes that is the only way to loosen the thread that strangles you.\n\nI stopped once, at a service station that had lived the same life in a hundred towns. I parked under a lamp that blinked like it was bored of its own job and went in to buy water and the kind of barley sugar my grandmother in my head would approve of. The girl at the till had green eyeliner like a deliberate mistake and a badge that said SERA even though she looked like a Sarah who didn\u2019t want to be. She smiled like she had been taught to and then like she meant it when she saw the nervous way I was tapping my fingers against my thighs. There was a rack of pamphlets about wine tours and a poster for a raffle to support a local rugby team, and someone had taped a sign under the EFTPOS machine that said You\u2019re doing great, sweetie. I believed them all for a minute and then pushed the feeling into my pocket with my change. When I came back out, the wind had done something interesting with my hair, and the gull on the roof of the building next door tilted its head at me like we were in on the same long-running joke.\n\nThe turn-off to Matakana arrived like a friend pretending to be casual about an important meeting. The road narrowed and then sighed, and the scenery made up its mind to be vineyards and orchards and hills that rolled themselves into the horizon and fell asleep. I drove past a sign for a farmers\u2019 market I\u2019d visited once when my life was more about the price of carrots than the price of flour, and then past a stand selling honey in jars that looked like spare suns, and then a child with a lemon stand that made my whole chest ache with a memory of wanting enough to make things for strangers. The vineyard was only half-hidden; you could see the neat rows of vines from the road like good handwriting, and between them the pale, stubborn gleam of a white tent that had become, for the last months, a symbol that could undo me. Production had overrun the gravel drive with a choreography of vans, cables, and determined people in headsets who all looked like they knew where they were going even when they didn\u2019t.\n\nSecurity waved me in with a clipboard and a smile that softened at the edges when I said my name. It is one of my secret pleasures to be expected in a place that is not a hospital. A woman with a lanyard that said Poppy in block letters and a pen tucked behind her ear materialized at my window and leaned down like a friendly crane. The smell of wet grass and coffee wove together around her.\n\n\u201cNia?\u201d she asked, even though my car was labeled and my face was on a sheet somewhere. \u201cKia ora. You made it. Park over there by the cones, please. Lovely. How are you feeling? Don\u2019t answer that, everyone\u2019s answer is \u2018weird\u2019. We\u2019ve got you checked in, temperature today\u2019s perfect for chocolate, and we hid the bees.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can hide bees,\u201d I said, because my mouth had to say something, and there was more of me in that question than I meant there to be.\n\n\u201cWe have a guy who whispers to them,\u201d she said, as deadpan as a judge. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet him in a minute. Come on. We\u2019ll get you mic\u2019ed up and in out of this breeze.\u201d\n\nIn a small, temporary building that had the audacity to pretend it was permanent, I was measured for my day in whispers. A woman with a belt full of tiny miracle machines clipped something to the back of my jeans and ran a wire up under my jumper so that the mic sat just at the hollow of my throat like a necklace that wasn\u2019t allowed to be pretty. I watched my hands while she worked and tried not to swallow because the cord tickled and I didn\u2019t want to be the person who choked on her own hype. In the mirror across the room, a person who looked like me stood in the light and smoothed her eyebrows and tried not to think about how many people would see the shine on her nose. I had dressed without a thought to cameras, except that I had, in a hundred small ways\u2014no stripes too small, no white that would ruin the exposure, the good apron in my bag as if an object could anchor me.\n\nPoppy handed me a laminated schedule that was both a map and a dare. The fonts were too cheerful for what they contained. Signature first, then a break that would be the length of three breaths, then the technical that would separate those of us who had sleep and steel from those of us who had grace, then interviews, then the long slow march to the showstopper that would either crown me or teach me something I would pretend to be grateful for later. She walked me out into the tent and the air lifted a little in my lungs like a relief. Nothing was a surprise and everything was. The long rows of benches were cleaner than any kitchen has a right to be, the equipment gleamed like we were in a catalogue for a life I couldn\u2019t afford, and the sides of the tent bellied in and out with the breeze as if the whole structure was breathing faster than it meant to. Outside, the vines waited like an audience with tans.\n\nMy bench was third from the left. Someone had written my name in thick, confident marker on a card taped to the counter, and beneath it someone else had corrected the spelling to include the macron and drawn a tiny smiley face next to the a. It undid me in a quiet, constructive way. I touched the card like it was a little banner, then set my box of ingredients where my hands would reach for them on instinct. The feijoas nestled in the tea towel I had wrapped them in; they smelled like my first summer that didn\u2019t hurt. My piping nozzles checked themselves against the list I had written with a stern voice in my head, and even though I had forgotten the leaf nozzle like a person sleepless about a small thing will always forget the exact small thing she was sleepless about, I felt the jolt of panic and then let it go. I could improvise leaves. I had been improvising leaves since I learned what green tasted like.\n\nArjun arrived at the bench to my right, wearing an apron that had the tidy, useful stains of someone who treated flour with a level of respect bordering on flirtation. He had once made a puff pastry that looked like it had read the manual first. He moved like a baker in his own kitchen even when the room was full of lenses, and it made me want to stand up straight. To my left, Maia set down a cooler bag with a thump that said she had brought enough butter to issue as rations. Her hair was braided into a plait that had survived a life of weather, and the moko kauae I had seen her get last month was healed now, elegant and sure. It was nice to be stood between a pair of people who understood something about food as a language, and something about stubbornness as a way to be polite to the world.\n\n\u201cMorning, team,\u201d Arjun said, in the muttered way we all said it, like a spell we shouldn't wake up.\n\n\u201cMorena,\u201d Maia said, and squeezed my shoulder once. \u201cYou sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a person who forgot,\u201d I said, and she grinned like the little lie had not fooled her. \u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a log on a boat,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is to say, I moved, but I stayed where I was.\u201d\n\nWe were shepherded to the front of the tent for a little about-to-happen that would later look like spontaneity. The hosts bounced in with a rush of cold air that made everyone smile because it let us know we were still here, and they did their jokes about us smelling good and being gluttons for punishment. They were kind, and that more than anything loosened my ribs. The judges were the other kind of kind, the kind that doesn\u2019t soften itself down for you because it trusts you enough to take the edges. One had fingers that could tell if a dough was lying; the other had eyes that could see if a cake had decided to be proud. They told us the brief and pretended we didn\u2019t know it already, and I felt the exact level change in the room when everyone found their rhythm inside the rules.\n\nThe Signature was what I had been afraid of and also what I had wanted: six lamingtons, elevated but true to their heart, almost identical in size and spirit, with a filling that could tame a stubborn judge. We had two hours, which is the kind of time that seems long until you watch it set itself on fire. I had made a list for this moment, and it was as good as a breath. Eggs, sugar, whip until they remember they were once a little bit sky; flour sifted like mercy; butter folded in like you\u2019re saying sorry and meaning it; bake, cool, don\u2019t cut corners, literally, because crumbs will betray you in the chocolate; curd at body temperature so it will spread like it lives there; coconut toasted because this is a tent and you need every layer of flavour to stand up and be counted when the cameras look at it. I had already decided against jam in a moment that had felt like treason at the time. Instead, I would use the feijoa curd and a line of lime-leaf sugar that had sat in a jar on my counter for a week, learning how to be itself.\n\nThey said go and the room changed colour. I beat eggs until they were pale enough to think of themselves as something else, and the sound of the whisk on metal was a rhythm I could set a life to. Pans into the oven, a flick of fingers I didn\u2019t label lucky but was, a glance at the oven thermometer because the numbers on the dial had lied to me before and would do it again if I let them. The tent breathed in and out and we breathed with it, and the camera crew moved around us like they were on a ski slope, all slick glides and unbothered balance. Arjun had his sponge in before I did and was melting chocolate with a seriousness he normally saved for his maths. Maia hummed, and the song was one my bones knew, and because of it I remembered to check the corners of my pan and loosen them with a knife so the sponge would not tear when I tipped it out.\n\nThe curd did the thing where it wants to be a sauce, then remembers that you love it, then thickens into the kind of pour that can be trusted. I tasted it the way my grandmother would have, with a finger I pretended not to stick in my mouth, and rolled the sharpness around like a coin. The feijoa had come through. The lime leaf sat like a complicated friend, interesting in the after. I cut squares and tried not to look mournful at the offcuts even though there is a part of me that wants to save everything. I slid them into the blast chiller like a thief returning treasure and stood still for a breath because stillness is an ingredient too.\n\nChocolate and coconut asked for the kind of attention I\u2019d long been bad at giving. I tempered by eye because my thermometer had a way of scolding me I didn\u2019t appreciate, and I trusted the way the chocolate felt under my spoon when it was ready to behave. I folded in a little cream to soften the snap because lamingtons are not meant to break a tooth, no matter how impressive the shine. The first dip will always tell you your future; mine went in, came out glossy, and caught its snow of coconut with a sigh that made me want to write a poem. That moment doesn\u2019t last, and I knew it, so I set myself to the repeatable actions, building a little assembly line as if I had invented industry. Knife, cut, curd, lid, dip, drip, roll, set, breathe. I kept thinking of Renee standing by the sink in the Avondale kitchen, her cigarette left unlit for ten minutes while she watched me whisk like my life depended on it, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t look at the bowl like it did you wrong. It\u2019s trying its best.\u201d\n\nWhen the hosts swung by, I found the version of myself that could talk without losing count of breaths. They wanted to know about the feijoa, if I was prepared to fight for it, if I knew half the country loved it and half thought it tasted like potpourri. I smiled like the old woman in me would have when the church ladies said her dress was too red. I said the fruit had raised me, that I was just doing right by it, that the coconut would act like a neighbour who softened the edges of a morning with a loaf delivered wearing a tea towel. They asked if I was worried about the time and I lied so sweetly I almost believed myself.\n\nAcross the bench, Arjun was doing a clever thing with pistachios and a cardamom syrup that made the tent smell like a holiday. His lamingtons were square in spirit even if the edges melted into the coconut like they wanted to join another shape, and he had a plan for how to crown them with a little shard of caramel that would look like light caught on the tongue. Maia stayed as true as a compass pointed to her own north. She cooked down wild blackberry jam she had foraged for last summer and carried back like contraband in jars wrapped in old socks. She wiped the edges of each square like a mother wiping a face, and then she did something I loved and would have feared: she rolled the coconut with kawakawa sugar, which let it look like sand that had grown up into a forest.\n\nThey laid a shot of the three of us like it was a school picture day where everyone turned up exactly who they were. Nobody said it aloud, but the air held the kind of quiet that meant we all understood what we were doing\u2014trying to speak our names out loud in a room that would always be bigger than us. When the judges came to taste, the tent found another, deeper stillness. The pastry queen cut into mine with a knife that looked like it had been sharpened by the sea, and her eyes did the thing they do when she has decided to be pleased. The other judge did that maddening, wonderful pause like he was writing the sentence in his head so he wouldn\u2019t say it wrong when it came out. They told me my sponge was tender, which in this context is not an insult but a knighthood, and that the feijoa had been handled with respect. One of them tilted their head and said perhaps the chocolate could have been a hair thinner, but then said a thing that folded me open, which was that my lamington tasted like a particular afternoon that could be named if you were brave. I didn\u2019t cry, but the part of me that likes corners more than the middle of rooms considered it.\n\nWe stood back and clapped for each other because this was not a war and we had learned what it would mean to make it one. Arjun got praise for balance and a nudge about his corners; Maia got a small lecture about the generosity of her jam and a compliment about courage. The hosts did a joke about coconut in their socks that did not land, and then another about rolling with it that did, and the tent exhaled as one organism. After they had what they wanted from our faces, we were released to the little corner where they had assembled snacks as if to remind us we were animals. I ate a handful of almonds like they had personally offended me and forced my mouth to drink water as if I were apologizing to it with each swallow.\n\nMy phone, which I had put face-down in the bag they allowed on the chair by the back of the tent, got to me anyway with its small insistence. In a moment between reality and its filming, I checked it, and there was a message the length of a breath from Coco at the hospice with a picture of Mrs. Healy\u2019s hand making a V that could have been victory or vigilance. Under it was a line that said, Eat, my girl, and remember you can always bake again tomorrow. The way my heart answered could not be called polite. It was a kind of shout that did not make a sound. I ate two more almonds, then a cube of cheese that had sweated itself into honesty, and then I let myself sit for a minute on the step at the back of the tent to look out at the vines and the sky that had already worked through three moods this morning.\n\nFor the technical, they took away the scaffolding we\u2019d built around ourselves. The brief was a sheet of paper with instructions designed to look helpful and actually teach you about your beliefs about God. We were told we would be making a mille-feuille, which is French for \u201ca thousand chances to fail\u201d and also for \u201cif you get the lamination right, you will feel a private joy you can\u2019t tell anyone about without sounding smug.\u201d There was going to be pastry cream, which seems easy until it decides to be scrambled eggs; there would be puff pastry from scratch, which would demand everything we had and then ask for a little more; there would be cutting, which is like translation\u2014you could have all the right words and still say something wrong if your knife wandered. We had two hours and forty-five minutes and the kind of cameras that can see through walls.\n\nI looked down at the butter and flour and water that were meant to become layers you could count and then not count. The tent had changed its breathing. People talk about miracles like they are big and obvious, but in kitchens they are small and absolute. Butter at the exact point it can be coerced without broken pride is one. The right amount of water to bring flour together without riling up the gluten is another. The way a bench can hold the cold until your hands learn it is the kind of quiet you only get when you\u2019ve made a friend of a surface. I measured with my eyes and then with the scale because I have learned that my eyes are romantic and the scale is stern. I kept my movements clean and sure, the way Mike had taught me to signal and merge, and I pressed the butter into a rectangle that asked not to be judged too early.\n\nWe folded like prayer. Single fold, chill, double fold, turn, chill, the kind of repetition that either bores you or saves you. Arjun muttered numbers under his breath and I watched the way his hands have become less precise and more sure over the past months; Maia sang something under hers and you could hear the paper of it, the way the sound laid itself down in sheets. Between folds, I cooked pastry cream with a whisk that has to be called faithful. Someone\u2019s cream split in the other row and a gentle panic rose like steam and then fell, because the judge leaned in and said two words\u2014cold bowl\u2014and the cream came back to itself like a girl deciding to try again.\n\nThe tent did a thing then that I love. It felt like a room where the rules were strict and the people were not cruel. You could feel us wanting each other to succeed because there is nothing interesting about being the best if the people next to you are ruined. I moved my dough to the oven and asked the universe to be reasonable about heat. This particular oven has a personality that can\u2019t be fixed; it thinks it is funny to be bright on the left and shy on the right, and if you do not know how to turn your tray at exactly the right moment, you will cry into a tea towel later. I did my turn, not because of anything I could prove but because my body had learned the timing. When the butter released little breaths, I let myself look pleased for exactly the length of a heartbeat.\n\nThere is a point in the technical where no one breathes properly. It\u2019s the cutting. I found the sharpest knife they had provided us, which is to say a knife sharp enough for chopping onions but not for slicing something that demands clean geometry. I heated the blade in hot water and wiped it dry and made a first cut that decided the other cuts. It was almost okay. It was okay enough that a person who loved me would see what I wanted and forgive what I couldn\u2019t make obey me. I stacked cream between pastry with the kind of care reserved for handling a baby or a bomb, and I dusted the top with sugar the way you finish a sentence you hope will land. When the judges came by, I felt the old schoolchild in me want to explain my mistakes before I was asked. I didn\u2019t. I let the sugar speak until it was time for me to say what I meant, which is that this was a technical but also a confession.\n\nMaia\u2019s layers were poems stacked on each other. Arjun\u2019s were a single sonnet that thought it was ten. Mine were tidy enough for a woman who has had to be tidy to live. The comments were the kind that see you from two angles and still hold you in the middle. I got a nod about lamination and a raised eyebrow about a pastry cream that had wanted to go grainy in its hour of pride; I took the criticism like a spoon and stirred it into the stew of myself for later. When we were released for ten minutes that felt like ten seconds, I walked back behind the tent to where the grape leaves stood like a thousand green tongues, and I let myself picture the showstopper without getting too cocky about it.\n\nThe sketch in my head for the final bake had gone through several evolutions, many of them crimes. It had wanted to be a croquembouche disguised as a p\u014dhutukawa tree, and then a lamington tower that would inevitably fall like a politician, and then a sensible tart that tasted like home without trying to be clever. In the end, I had found a shape that felt like a handshake with myself. I would make a reef of little cakes and crisp things and gooey things, a low, wide celebration instead of a height contest. There would be feijoa sabl\u00e9 cookies pressed with a floral pattern my body remembered from a plate at a house I left when I was ten. There would be tiny brul\u00e9e\u2019d tartlets filled with a curd that married lemon and feijoa without making a sound about it. There would be fingers of sponge dipped in a chocolate that didn\u2019t bite, a little ripple of meringue that had behaved itself under a torch, shards of sugar spun thinner than my patience and stuck in place like a vow. It would build outwards like an afternoon on the back steps, the way Mrs. Kline had told me to, and I would not apologize for any of it.\n\nBefore they called us back, Poppy came to stand next to me like a person who remembers the exact shape of your bubble. She checked my mic with a practiced flick, then asked if I needed water or a joke or a different life. I asked for the joke, and she told me one about a croissant walking into a bar and being told to leave because the bar was gluten-free, which did not make me laugh until it did. She adjusted the wire at the back of my neck like she was gentling an animal, then let me have one of the small private moments no one tells you are the thread that hold these days together. I put my hand in my pocket to touch the note Mrs. Kline had slipped under my door, and the paper crackled like a dare. There was a smear of butter on it now so faint you\u2019d miss it, and I wondered if everything I loved would eventually carry that mark.\n\nWe were called to places and the room narrowed back down to the exact size of my bench. The hosts said something lively that would later be intercut with music that made us sound braver than we were, and the judges looked like they were prepared to be moved and not put up with nonsense. I rolled my shoulders like an athlete in a body that forgot it was one, and I reached for the first thing I needed to bring my idea into the day\u2019s light. Outside the tent, the vines lifted their hands a little in the breeze like they were trying to get a question in. In my head, I could hear Jules saying, Control what you can, and the rest is for ghosts and editors, and I thought, Not today, friends. Today, everything I can hold, I will.\n\nThe first hour went the way you pray for without calling it prayer. Butter behaved, flour didn\u2019t sulk, sugar took the hint, and my hands moved in a rhythm that must have been in me from the days before I knew the names for things. I stamped the sabl\u00e9 cookies with the little ceramic press I had borrowed from Lena, the one that made a pattern like the lace on the dress I wore to the fancy fundraiser at the caf\u00e9 where we auctioned off croissants to rich people who didn\u2019t know how to eat them. I filled the tart shells with the curd that had learned me and set them on a tray like an army that wanted to be loved. I whipped egg whites with the calm that only comes when you have already cried about meringue enough times that it cannot surprise you, and I leaned my head into the heat of the torch like a cat visiting an altar and kissed the tips of each swirl with gold.\n\nThen the tent did a small trick, the one that turns the second hour into a test of breath. The wind picked up, the side of the marquee belled in, and something in the generator made a sound that could only be described as thoughtful. The lighting flickered like it wanted drama and then remembered the insurance. The hosts did a walk-through of how much time we had left and managed not to make it sound like a threat. The judges toured the room with their eyes and maybe a small part of their hearts. The sound man at my elbow whispered sorry as he adjusted a thing that had migrated across my shoulder blade, and I smiled like I was a person who could carry anything.\n\nI spun sugar because I am occasionally a fool. I heated it to that hard crack stage with the attention you would give a confession, then let it fall in threads off the fork onto the back of a greased ladle, forming little transparencies that would stand where I asked them to like obedient glass. It clumped in one corner when I got cocky and paid the price by burning half a pot that will smell like the end of the world until the end of time. I moved to the stove to rescue the caramel from becoming a weapon, and I bumped elbows with Arjun as he marched past with a tray of choux he had decided at the last minute to add because some people cannot help but be extra. We apologized in a choreography we have practiced for months. I assembled what I could and kept half an eye on the clock that is always a liar and always right.\n\nCherry flickered in my mind then, in the exact moment a patch of sugar cooled too much to bend to my will. It was the memory of the stutter, the suggestion of the little cough that had made me say not yet, not yet. I placed the sugar aside and reminded that part of my brain that there is no version of this day where going back to the car will fix anything except the way I talk to myself. The hosts swung by again with a comment about how pretty the sugar looked like winter on a glasshouse, and I told them I didn\u2019t believe in winter and they pretended to be scandalized and I laughed, which is to say I performed a small exorcism on the panic.\n\nWhen the third hour hit, it didn\u2019t ask for permission. Chocolate had to be melted again because it had gone off to sulk in a corner; coconut, which had been waiting politely, suddenly wanted attention like a toddler at a funeral; the curd asked to be trusted one more time and coasted over the line like a girl crowd-surfing. I placed the last tartlet and then moved three things half a centimetre like that would save us all. Behind me, Maia put her hand on her hip and closed her eyes for a second as if hearing an answer to a question she had not asked aloud. To my right, Arjun swore in a language that sounded like home to him, then grinned because sometimes it is a relief to hear yourself swear in your own words.\n\nWe did the final tidy the way you tidy the room where you were kissed for the first time\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter, but also it matters. The call came with that fake-chipper tone to put down our tools, and I did, even the part of me that thought I could stick one more little shard of sugar in and not have it collapse did. I stepped back from the bench and looked at the thing I had made, and it looked back at me with the face of every kitchen I have ever stood in. It was imperfect and glorious and had my fingerprints all over it, as every true thing does. When they asked me what it was, I said the sentence I had been afraid of saying because of what it gives away. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s a backyard afternoon with a mother I don\u2019t remember and a woman who taught me to say please to butter, and it\u2019s mine, and it wants you to sit down and stay.\u201d\n\nThey took their time. The cameras leaned in from their leashes. The judge cut one of the tartlets and let the curd sigh onto the plate, and the other judge broke a sabl\u00e9 between his fingers and listened to the sound like it could tell him my name. The hosts did their job and got out of the way in a way that deserves medals. I let the breath out of my body and did not take another one until they nodded at something I could not yet read as blessing or lesson.\n\nAnd then the thing happened that I had been waiting for without admitting it. A runner from Production appeared at the side of the tent as if conjured from a prayer, her face that particular calm that only ever means one of two things. She crossed to me with that delicate, unflappable walk you learn from carrying plates of hot food through rooms full of people looking at you. She touched two fingers to the place on my arm where skin is thinnest and spoke quietly enough that the microphones had to strain. \u201cNia,\u201d she said, gentle but with the weight of her being paid to tell the truth. \u201cBefore we do the judging. It\u2019s Mrs. Healy. They rang through. She asked that if we could find you, we would. She says she\u2019s fine and she\u2019s not fine, and she says to tell you to say what you meant to say anyway.\u201d\n\nThe tent, which had been a single sound all day, seemed to stand back to let me hear that sentence. There is a way that news moves through a body; it doesn\u2019t ask for your heart first. It goes straight for your knees and your taste and the little muscles in your face that keep you upright when the tide pulls. I nodded and then I shook my head and then I remembered how to hold my neck. \u201cIs there\u2014\u201d I started, and the runner, whose badge said TARA in looping letters, shook her head once like a person who had been told to be careful with the spirit she was handling.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s being looked after,\u201d Tara said, and when she said looked after it held a universe. \u201cShe wanted me to say, Make sure they smell the lemon. She was very clear on that. Do you want to call? Not now, but\u2014she wanted you to know before, not after.\u201d\n\nIf I had been alone, I would have become one of those people who kneel on kitchen floors. There is a tile back in Avondale that knows the shape of my knees. In the tent, with a camera pretending not to watch and a judge pretending not to care that they were watching, I did the thing I have learned to do. I built a little room inside myself and put the news in it with water and a blanket and said, I will be back in a minute, my love. I looked at the showstopper like it could tilt the world back into order, and then I looked at Tara and said, \u201cTell them I\u2019m ready,\u201d and meant it, which surprised me enough that I smiled.\n\nThe judging went on, because judging always goes on, because this is the deal we make with narrative. They ate our afternoons and our stubbornness and our faith in butter. They spoke in sentences that tried to hold the shape of fairness. They looked at us like we were trying to add something to the vocabulary of sugar and they were prepared to hear us out. When they got to me and asked what I called it, I didn\u2019t repeat the speech I had practiced because I am not a person who was built to say anything twice the same way. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s called Back Steps,\u201d and when they asked me why I told them about Mrs. Kline\u2019s note, about Renee\u2019s hands, about a girl who stood at the edge of a room and counted the plates in case there weren\u2019t enough, and about the first time I learned that you can feed a person and make them less alone for ten minutes. I said it like I was allowed to be a person who speaks in tents with lights on her face.\n\nThey nodded, and the pastry queen did that thing where she presses her lips together to keep something from escaping that might be mistaken for too much feeling. The other judge looked down at his notes and then up like he had remembered there was a person attached to the food. They said the curd was daring and the sabl\u00e9 carried the pattern like a secret, and they teased me about spinning sugar without a safety net like I believed in angels. They gave me one tiny fix I would make every time for the rest of my life\u2014the chocolate on the sponge could have been thinner still, like the line between being proud and being arrogant\u2014and then they handed me back my own afternoon, slightly rearranged but intact.\n\nAfter, when they sent us to be filmed pretending we were not about to be told our fates, I found a corner of the vineyard that had been left alone by humans for the morning. It was a little place behind a low wall where weeds had elected a council and a spider had written a letter to someone I will never meet. I pressed my phone between my hands until it warmed like a living thing and called the number for the hospice that I had learned without meaning to, the way you know the rhythm of your name spoken by someone who loves you.\n\nCoco answered because Coco always answers. The sound of the fluorescent lights came through like a gentle reprimand. She said my name like she was smoothing a tablecloth. She told me two things at once\u2014you did good, and she is thinking of you\u2014and then filled in all the little places between them with details so that I wouldn\u2019t have to imagine the wrong ones. Mrs. Healy had had a dip. The kind that makes the nurses speak softly and the day move sideways. She had refused being fussed over and then accepted a glass of water like a queen. She was letting the pills pull her into a place where she might see someone who has been waiting for her. She had, Coco said, asked me to listen very carefully when I heard whatever I was about to hear.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come tonight,\u201d I said, already counting the exits home in my head.\n\n\u201cCome if you can,\u201d Coco said, always practical. \u201cDrive like you have sense. Eat something. She hates it when you don\u2019t eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ate almonds,\u201d I said, which is not food, and Coco made the noise she makes when she doesn\u2019t agree but will let you make your own mistakes until you are ready to confess and be fed.\n\nBack in the tent, the air had found a new shape again. Someone had righted a light that had wanted to tilt into metaphor. The hosts were practising a line that would carry the right weight without sinking the room. Arjun flicked a crumb off the corner of his shirt with the kind of concentration normally reserved for tying knots, and Maia looked out at the vines and then back at her hands like she had just remembered where her power lives. We stood in the little semi-circle they had told us to stand in like a day care for grown-ups with oven burns, and we did the thing we had promised ourselves we would do a hundred times: we breathed and we did not let our faces give away every room inside of us.\n\nThey told us, because they must, who had stood a little taller today. They used the language that is decorous and decided by committees, and inside of it there were words that were for us alone. When they said my name in the way that meant I had done what I came to do, the world tilted but did not fall. I did not drop my face into my hands because I had been taught to be polite in public, but it would be a lie to say I did not picture doing it. They put a hand on my shoulder and did not hold on too hard. Arjun and Maia hugged me in a sandwich that smelled like sugar and clean steel, and I hugged them back in the exact way that meant I would buy their first books and send them messages when their babies were born, whether those babies were bread or breathing.\n\nAfter, when the images had been gathered and the people with the clipboards said we could be human beings again, I found a bench outside the tent where the sun had warmed a patch just for me. I sat down and put my head in my hands and then lifted it right back up because I could hear Renee in my bones telling me to mind my hair if I wanted to look like myself on camera later. I drank water until my ribs felt like they had been asked to stop being instruments and become a house. My phone buzzed again, and there was a message from Lena that was all caps and exclamation points and a picture of a tray of meringues that had been burned by a love that was too hot and then rescued anyway. There was one from Kahu that said simply, You did it? and another that said, I told the gulls, which made me laugh on a sound that startled a bee.\n\nThe day was not over, not by a long stretch. There would be interviews where I would tell the story like I had known all along what I was doing, and there would be shots of me walking down a row of vines that would make me look like a person who thinks in neat rows. There would be the packing away of the little kitchen I had built in an hour and a half, and the moment where everyone goes quiet for five seconds for a sound thing, and the way the tent looks when it is only a big, silly piece of fabric and not the inside of a dream. There would be the drive back through the afternoon, when the traffic would forget it remembered me this morning, and the stop at the dairy where the same man would sell me milk and I would tell him the cricket score he already knew. There would be the hospice in the blue hour, and the smell of lemon hand gel and hope, and the seat by the bed where I would put my elbows and fold my hands and say what I had meant to say to Mrs. Healy even if she was watching from a little ways away.\n\nI stood because standing seemed like a new thing to try. I walked because it would mean I might eventually get to the door. I put my hand on the tent pole at the edge of the world they had built and felt the whole structure shiver the way it does when a gust runs through, and I remembered the first time the gulls learned my name. They are not sentimental birds, gulls. They will take what you hold if you leave it on a table. They screamed my name like it was something to do to fill the morning. Today, they could have it. I had enough names for myself to share.Chapter 5\n\nIn the weeks between the tent and the television, the secret sat in my pocket like a hot stone I didn\u2019t know whether to hold onto or put down. I carried it past the caf\u00e9 counter where Lena double-checked her cinnamon to make a point, past the noticeboard at the dairy where someone had thumbtacked a flyer for a missing budgie named Shrek, past the hospice where the windows practiced being kind to everyone who looked through them. Production took me to a room with too much white and told me how to be myself, on message. Poppy put a fresh lanyard around my neck like it was a medal and showed me where to stand so the light forgave me. I smiled next to a pyramid of lemons that had been wiped to within an inch of their dignity and lifted a whisk with an expression that belonged on a saint who\u2019d been told the carving would last longer if she stopped moving. They needed photos of me that didn\u2019t look like anyone who had taken off their shoes in the kitchen at midnight to talk to a jar of curd, so I tried to imagine I was the kind of woman who could predict the weather by the sound the oven made when it settled.\n\nMrs. Healy began to drift like a boat untethered from a wharf she\u2019d been born beside and had always meant to leave. I went in the mornings with scones too soft inside and just proud enough on the outside to be forgiven, and in the afternoons with citrus tarts that looked like the sun had taken its hat off and stayed. Some days she woke sharp and clear and told me stories about a boy who had loved her once and brought her peaches so ripe they made the kitchen blush, about a garden where beans had climbed up into the roof and taught her that you can coax anything if you plant it with your whole chest. Other days, she floated somewhere gentle and let my voice fill the room like a radio left on low in another flat. Coco kept lavender at her wrists because she understood what it was to trick the air into thinking everything was less hard than it was, and she showed me how to tuck a blanket in at the corners like you were promising something you could keep. When pain came, it dropped its anchor and didn\u2019t pretend otherwise. Mrs. Healy would watch it like it was an uninvited guest at a party, then wave it into the kitchen and tell it there was tea, and if it wanted to stay it would have to listen to three jokes first.\n\nThe night I drove across town fast for no reason I could name, the sky was that thin indigo that reminds you how big it gets when you\u2019re not looking. Cherry hummed like a woman pretending to hum who is really pleading. The hospice doors opened with the hush of something practiced, and the nurse at the desk looked up and knew my name like she was expecting me, which, as it turned out, she was. The room was dim in the way of rooms that have decided to be kind by being quiet, and the lemon on the hand gel walked the line between hospital and heaven. Mrs. Healy\u2019s breath did the soft, stubborn work it had learned, and her hair was a crown of wild white spun sugar against the pillow. I sat where I always sat and told her everything about the tent except the part I wasn\u2019t allowed to say, and that made her smile, because the woman loved a rule that bent a little for the right person. When she woke enough to press my fingers with hers, she said, Don\u2019t get thin, remember to salt your butter, and when they cut you open with kindness, say thank you and then eat. I told her there was a tart cooling on my counter with her name on it. She said, Let it be for the living, then closed her eyes like a door that knows exactly where it is on its hinges.\n\nGrief has its own tight little chores. I buttered toast I didn\u2019t want and ate it because Coco\u2019s face told me I would be watched if I didn\u2019t. I went out to the car and cried in the exact shape of the steering wheel because sometimes that is the only place you can hold the sob and not spill it on someone else\u2019s shoes. Kahu turned up on the steps after sunup with two coffees and a bag of mandarins and a way of leaning his shoulder against mine that reminded my bones they were not hollow. We made lists even then\u2014death requires them as much as television does\u2014and put things on them we could tick off with a hand that shook less when it had something to do. The hospice women took my cake and turned it into a table that looked like a quilt. The knitting ladies put their spiky love into a blanket with a mistake in the corner on purpose so nothing would be asked to be perfect. Someone from the Tuesday group sang a song I didn\u2019t know I knew the words to, and when we carried Mrs. Healy out on a morning that had decided to be ordinary despite everything, the gulls went quiet at the window as if even they had a gentle bone.\n\nIt is strange, to lift a win that won\u2019t be public for weeks alongside a loss that is loud right now. I walked through days with my tongue caught between my teeth to keep from spilling, and every so often the secret would warm my pocket and threaten my mouth. Lena kept me on the machine and off the internet. People came into the caf\u00e9 and said things like, Are you that girl, and I\u2019d prefer an oat flat white if you have it, and my cat has developed a taste for brioche, and anyway, we\u2019re all proud of you, hun, and I took the coins and gave the change and tried to imagine every mouth had sugar in it. A man with paint under his nails who fixed fences for a living told me he\u2019d never watch a baking show on purpose, then asked if lamingtons had rules, and when I said they did, he nodded like it was good to know there were laws somewhere. I went to Tasi\u2019s with lamingtons and a brioche and he told me that Cherry was singing like a choir that had been paid in pies. He wiped his hands on a rag, said the word sister the way a man says it when he means more than blood, and offered to paint the tyres bench if I ever needed somewhere to sit people down and feed them for money.\n\nOn the day the episode would finally air, Auckland put on a sky as thin as muslin that let the light through anyway. We put a sign on the community centre door that said Bring a plate and a story, and the people showed up with both like they had been told there were only enough chairs for those who remembered who they were. Kahu borrowed the hospice projector because the hospice is generous in both directions, and wrangled an extension cord that had opinions about being tripped over. Tasi arrived with a tray of panipopo that made the air reconsider itself and a look like he had done something smug he wasn\u2019t going to brag about. Mrs. Kline came down the stairs with Beethoven in a little harness she had knit out of unlikely yarn and an expression that said she did not plan on asking permission to be present. Arjun texted a picture of three bowls he\u2019d set out on his kitchen table labelled salt, sugar, tears, and Jules called from Christchurch and propped their phone against a jar of pickles so I could watch the dance the light made across their wall when they laughed.\n\nThe room smelled like garlic bread, cheap paper plates, and a dozen secrets lightly salted. A boy I remembered from a house I left when I was eight turned up taller and softer and said, Do you remember the dog we weren\u2019t supposed to have, and I said, I remember the dog we had anyway. Lena organized people the way she organizes sugar on a bench, which is to say with efficiency and an eye for where sweetness is needed most. I put the Back Steps platter on a table near the wall with the peeling paint like a set piece for a life I recognized. The sabl\u00e9 had kept their pattern; the little tartlets sat like good children pretending not to be clever, and the meringue had not wept in the car, which felt like a personal miracle. We turned the volume up too loud at first because we were afraid of missing anything, then turned it down because the sound of ourselves was a better soundtrack than anything that had been edited for us.\n\nWatching yourself is an out-of-body experience if the body you leave behind is holding a plate of sausage rolls. I saw my hand before I saw my face, saw the way flour clung to the heel of my palm and the way I set a bowl down like it could startle. The tent looked cleaner and sillier than it had felt, and my bench looked like a place I had grown up by accident and only realized when I had to say goodbye. The hosts made jokes we had laughed at already and then again because they had been given a nicer home. The judges said words I knew they had said and they still felt like a hand on my shoulder when I needed it. The lamingtons didn\u2019t crumble under the chocolate this time, on screen. The mille-feuille cut clean as a sentence with no apologies. My mouth on camera said, It\u2019s called Back Steps, and I heard the ripple in the room behind me before the show heard it, and it sounded like a little neighbourhood saying we see you.\n\nWhen the moment came, they made an entire country hold its breath for exactly the length of time that makes you hate everyone with a clipboard and then forgive them all at once. They said my name. They said it without mangling it, with the a the way it is written, and someone had remembered the macron, and I felt that thing again that is not quite being born and not quite being undressed. The room went up like a pan deglazed with wine. The sound was a cheer and a laugh and a sob and the brittle clatter of cutlery hitting plates and not breaking. I was hugged from six directions by people who all thought they were the only one who knew to hold me under the ribs where it counts, and Beethoven screamed at the ceiling because that is how he expresses joy at scale. Lena cried like a kettle and pretended she\u2019d got something in her eye; Kahu stood on a chair and nearly fell off and then stood on it again because he liked being taller than a moment for once; Mrs. Kline whacked me on the arm with a bonne chance nobody asked her to translate, and Tasi slipped three savoury pies into my bag with a wink because he is a man who plans your hunger before you feel it.\n\nMy phone forgot how to be silent. Messages arrived like cicadas. Some were friends who had been holding their breath in other rooms. Some were strangers who wanted to tell me about the first time their grandmother had let them stir the batter and how they had never felt worthy since, and would I send them the recipe for feeling needed. One was from a woman named Beth who said she had sat in a kitchen with a woman named Renee who used to talk about a girl who whisked like she was trying to beat life into something that had forgotten itself, and was that possibly me. It was as if a match had been struck and left burning in my chest. Another was a number I didn\u2019t recognize that said simply, You made it taste like afternoons. The hospice sent me a picture of the TV in the staff room and three nurses pretending not to cry. The caf\u00e9\u2019s page tagged me in a post that said, Our girl, and a photo of a lamington that had tried its best and mostly succeeded.\n\nI took my plate of tartlets out onto the back steps because I had promised Mrs. Kline and because I needed air that had not been breathed by a hundred beloveds. The concrete held the heat like a lap. The alley smelled like jasmine and the world\u2019s oldest mop. A cat that was not Beethoven drifted past with the disposition of a poet trying to remember a rhyme for hunger. Down on the street, a gull stood on the bonnet of a stranger\u2019s car and contemplated its life with an admirable seriousness, then screamed two notes that somehow added up to my name. Jules\u2019 face wobbled on my phone in that way of video calls and then stilled, their smile big enough to tilt the moon. They didn\u2019t say Well? because friends who have the right kind of manners don\u2019t ruin a good question, but their eyes did the asking for them. I held up the last tart and bit into it and held the other half to the screen like a sacrament, and we both laughed for a while before we remembered what crying\u2019s for.\n\nBy the end of the night, the tables looked like a dozen small festivals had been held on them and everyone had gone home full. I wiped them down with water that turned flour to thick little ghosts under my cloth and put the chairs back where they would pretend to live until next time. People came and went in waves and left me with words I kept picking up later to see how they felt in the hand. A woman I didn\u2019t recognize hugged me and said, You\u2019ve changed nothing and everything, which I plan to embroider on the nearest tea towel. When almost everyone had left, Mrs. Kline tottered over with something wrapped in waxed paper and a look like she had been saving this too long and might break if she didn\u2019t pass it on. Inside was a photograph bleached at the edges and softened by too many summers, and in it, a younger me stood on a bench in a kitchen I had not visited in years, holding a wooden spoon like it was a microphone, while a woman with a scar at her eyebrow and hands like weather laughed behind me. On the back, in a blunt pencil, someone had written NIA + RENEE\u2019S SCONES\u2014FIRST TRY, and the year that made my stomach make a sound of its own.\n\n\u201cHow\u2014\u201d I tried, but Mrs. Kline was already nodding her head like a small, smug metronome.\n\n\u201cCommunity centre clear-out, long time ago,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one claimed the box. I don\u2019t like things that get lost. You can\u2019t keep every stray, but some of them will just live under the bed if you let them.\u201d\n\nI took the picture like it would jump. \u201cDo you know if\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s alive?\u201d Mrs. Kline\u2019s eyes were as kind as they have ever been and sharp as I have ever known them. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I know somebody who keeps track of people who keep track of people. I also know the way you said her name.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, the air tasted like it had rained without the sky admitting it. I woke to seventeen requests to make a cake that looked like a lighthouse and one to make biscuits shaped like a cat named Tango, and a very serious email from a morning show asking if I could be cheery at a time of day when I normally look like a cautionary tale. I said yes to what I could and no to the things that made my stomach clench, and I put the kettle on and sent a message to a market manager in Matakana asking about stall fees and whether you could share a power point without starting a family feud. Kahu came out of his room with his hair doing that thing where it looks like a hero fresh from a wind tunnel and waved a printout that said Business Plan Template as if it were a seashell he\u2019d found and wanted to teach to sing. He insisted his thesis brain could carry a bakery as easily as it could carry the price of water under colonialism, and I let him because it made him happy to have a new river to argue with.\n\nI went for a walk down to the shops because I wanted the world to confirm it had noticed nothing and also everything. A girl on a scooter grinned at me and said, Nice cakes, and didn\u2019t stop. The dairy man told me the cricket score before I asked and slid an extra barley sugar into my hand like I was a child who had managed not to cry at the hairdresser. Mr. Singh\u2019s wife told me in a whisper that she had started putting coconut on everything and that her husband now thought he was allergic to success. The florist two doors down had copied out a quote about living deliberately and hung it upside down in the window because the tape had ideas. The city kept being itself, which is to say, it carried me whether I knew it or not.\n\nAt home, I cleared the table with the reverence of someone laying out tools. The photograph went in the centre like a small altar. I wrote two lists\u2014one called Back Steps and one called People Who Knew Renee\u2014and I let the pencil choose how big the letters would be. On the Back Steps list, I wrote things like find a cheap oven that will not explode, learn how to say no to people who bring you avocados and expect cake, ask Tasi about a kettle big enough to bathe a baby in, file forms even if they feel like they are asking for pieces of you you need. On the other, I wrote names that tasted old on my tongue, a neighbour who had known everyone and had a memory like a recipe box, a social worker with soft shoes who had once cried in a hallway and thought no one had seen, a woman at the community centre who had kept her hair in a tight bun that could have been a weapon if you were foolish, and a boy who had called himself an only child even when he wasn\u2019t.\n\nAnd then\u2014because when life gives you a day you start a thing that will fail without witness\u2014I baked. Not for anyone who would pay me or write about me or hand me a ribbon, but for the back steps I could see from my kitchen window, the concrete sun-warmed and unglamorous and waiting. I made the scones from the old recipe whose card I had copied with the indecent care of a thief. I cut in the butter until the flour looked like it had been snowed on without malice, and I added the milk in the careful measure that sits somewhere between parsimony and love, and I patted the dough out with an open hand, which is really the only way to make it behave. I stamped circles with a glass that had once held cheap beer at a party I still haven\u2019t forgiven, brushed the tops with cream like a blessing, and baked them until they had the colour of good shoes. I took them outside with a jar of jam I had been saving and a tin of condensed milk nobody admits to but everyone uses when they have something to say in sugar.\n\nI sat on the step and split a scone and the steam made a point, and I put jam and milk on it and ate with my eyes closed because there are times when that is the only way to register your life. The alley hummed. The sun slid itself up over the roofline with the laziness of a cat at noon. A gull landed on the fencepost and looked at me like a judge. I held out the last bite because I am not above bribing the wild, and it took it and made a sound that would have been a laugh in any other animal. My phone buzzed in my pocket with a new message from an unknown number that began, I think I know where she is, and the blood rushed to the places inside me that usually only open for hot water and weather. I licked the jam off my thumb and looked at the photograph again and believed the thing hard enough that sometimes you get what you want. I believed that the steps you take because you promised someone you'd do a thing you said out loud are the kinds that make a small path appear where it wasn\u2019t before, and if you\u2019re lucky, and if you\u2019re stubborn, and if the gulls have learned your name, the path doesn\u2019t vanish when you stop looking.\n\nIn the days that followed, I learned to turn down some offers with a grace I know I didn\u2019t grow myself. A magazine wanted me to stand in a dress that would not forgive me if I ate lunch and hold a whisk like a baton; I said no with thanks and offered them a recipe that came with a paragraph about a woman with a scar in her eyebrow and a laugh that could teach a spoon its job. A radio show asked me to come on and talk about resilience, which I almost did until I remembered I am not a story you can bottle for commuting. The morning television took me anyway, a woman painted until I recognized myself only in the corners, and Poppy stood where I could see her and tipped her head when I started to talk too fast. I told the country to salt their butter and to stop being ashamed of their sweet tooth and to meet their neighbours because there is no recipe that doesn\u2019t start with that. Back at the caf\u00e9, Lena put me on dishes and told the staff that fame had not softened me, and I told her to tell them I had hidden my spine in the cutlery drawer.\n\nEvenings found me in front of cupboards with a phone tucked under my chin, calling numbers that had been given to me by numbers who remembered other numbers. People who keep track of people had been kinder to me than I deserved for most of my life; sometimes they were busy and sometimes they were weary, and mostly, they had stories that made us both sit down. A woman at a shelter told me Renee had taught a girl she wasn\u2019t related to how to tell the difference between the smell of soap and the smell of lies, and we were quiet for a bit because sometimes all you can do when given a detail like that is let it change the tilt of the room. An old landlord told me he\u2019d liked the way she always lined up her shoes by the door, ready to run if someone needed running after. A boy who had become a man with tattoos like declarations told me she had let him sleep on her couch and had made him pancakes she\u2019d called flapjacks with a voice that made him fill the sink to wash up like he could save something.\n\nThe lead from the message that had started with I think I know where she is pulled like a kite string. A nurse in Tauranga had heard a story about a woman who\u2019d moved down the coast to help a cousin and had stayed to look after a woman she had found crying on a bus. A man in a bar in \u014chope said his aunt had bought scones from someone who made them so right you remembered your dead when you ate them, and he was not a man who had meant to remember anyone that day. A library volunteer in Whakat\u0101ne sent me a photograph of a noticeboard where a flyer with a blunt pencil had advertised a Saturday baking class, Gold coin donation, No fuss, Don\u2019t be rude about my oven. The email came with a second photo of a woman\u2019s hands rolling a dough you could almost smell. She had a scar at her eyebrow. Her hair had gone silver like a mercy. The kind of hope that makes the ribs sore set up camp and started boiling water for tea.\n\nI asked Kahu if he wanted a road trip and he said he had an academic meeting and then laughed like that was a joke. We packed the car with bananas, a bag of scones that Lena had insisted on making though she swore she would never be sentimental in pastry again, two thermoses, a blanket that had seen better beaches, and the photograph in a plastic sleeve like it was a passport. Tasi checked Cherry\u2019s tyres and put his hand on the bonnet and told her to behave and then told me to call if she didn\u2019t and not to be proud about it. Mrs. Kline gave me a list of things to say to strangers if they looked at me like a feral child and reminded me that people in other cities are also people, which I accused her of knowing firsthand and she admitted quietly. Jules called to say, If it\u2019s not her, it is someone else someone will need you to bake for, and the sentence was a map.\n\nWe took the road east like we meant it. The city loosened its grip and the land remembered water, and the radio did that thing where it forgets your mood and then gets it right by accident. The sky decided to be neither spectacular nor sulking, the exact kind you can drive under without imagining anyone is watching you from behind it. On the Paeroa stretch, billboards told us who to vote for and where to buy tyres and how to get rid of a mould problem with vinegar and something that absolutely wasn\u2019t bleach, promise. At the big L&P bottle, we got out and took a picture we pretended not to take because we are not tourists even when we are, and Kahu said the thing about lemon and Paeroa and secret recipes in a voice that made even the sign look like it was tired of being asked. The gulls, somehow, had come east ahead of us and were waiting on a roof in the main street like a meeting had been called.\n\nWe found the community hall with the noticeboard without having to ask. The flyers on it were sun-faded except for the one with the blunt pencil\u2014a Saturday baking class with a date that suggested she had been here long enough for people to expect her on Saturdays. Inside, the hall smelled like varnish and shoes and something baked last week. A whiteboard announced a meeting of the midweek walkers and a raffle for a hamper that contained two kinds of chutney and a bottle of wine with a label that had birds on it. There were stacks of chairs that had known a hundred meetings where nothing happened and two where everything did. I stood in the doorway as if I could step into my own photograph. The room did not turn into a cathedral. It was just a room. You want that for your lives, if you are lucky: for things to be exactly themselves when you arrive in them.\n\nA woman came in from the kitchen with flour at the hinge of her thumb and a face I had learned in a place that smelled like rain and cheap deodorant. She stopped moving, briefly, in the way that points are made. The scar at her eyebrow lifted as if it wanted to be counted among the present. She said my name like it had never been mispronounced by a teacher and I hadn\u2019t left it behind anywhere, and I said hers like it couldn\u2019t have belonged to anyone else ever. We looked at each other with the caution you give something fragile that has forgotten it is also made of bone. Then she crossed the room with a dishtowel in one hand and a spoon in the other because no one who loves as their first language arrives empty, and she put her hand against my cheek the way she had put it there in a different kitchen in a different suburb on a day when the power had gone out and the gas oven had been a miracle.\n\n\u201cI taught you to cut butter with two knives,\u201d she said, and the knife in her voice had softened in the places where knives need to do that.\n\n\u201cAnd you told me not to throw away a batch,\u201d I said. \u201cEven the sinners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all of us saints sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you bring your own apron?\u201d\n\nI had. It was in the bag because I am a woman who prepares for polite ambushes. We went into the kitchen because it is the room where we know what to say. Kahu stood in the doorway like a cousin who understands this is not his scene and also entirely is, and he found a kettle and put it on because tea is an act of love too short to be misinterpreted. Renee took out one bowl, and then another, and put them down with a rhythm I recognized from rooms where I\u2019d had to count chairs and fights and silences. She handed me a bag of flour and said, Show me, and I showed her, and we did not speak for the length of time it takes to rub in butter with your fingertips until it disappears and reappears as weather.\n\nLater, we would say all the things that hurry to the edge of the mouth in reunions and decide which ones to let jump. We would lay out the years like towels on a fence and look at the stains and decide which ones mattered and which ones were simply proof we had lived. She would tell me where she had gone when she left the house in Avondale and why. I would tell her about Mrs. Healy and the tent and the gulls and the feeling of holding the wheel and telling the car not yet. She would tell me about the girls and the boys and the not-quite-grown she had taught to boil water without burning it and to make rice without breaking into pieces when it stuck. I would tell her about Back Steps and how a photograph you handed in a kitchen could become a place on a map you\u2019d been making with your whole body.\n\nFor now, we made scones because there are times when language has to be eaten before it can be understood. The oven in the hall was older than any of us and had the temperament of an auntie who would lend you money and call you at six in the morning to ask about it in a voice that actually wanted to know if you were warm enough. We put the tray in and crouched in front of the glass like hopeful children watching a trick, and when the tops browned and rose and leaned into each other like neighbours, we smiled with half our faces, the half that remembered each other from another life. We took them out and split one open and put butter on it and watched it melt, and then we put our tongues on the past and found it could be sweet without being untrue. We sat on the back steps of that hall, the same concrete as every hall in every town, and ate what we had made and looked at the road as if it had been waiting for us to sit down so it could continue.\n\nOutside, a child yelled something that didn\u2019t need translating. The gulls, late to the party for once, arrived in a ragged little cloud and argued about nothing on the roof. The sun found a way through the clouds like it always had a plan to arrive and was only being dramatic. It would be a long drive home, and then a longer run of days with forms and flour and the terrible joy of telling people where to stand and where to find the bathroom. There would be a market with a stall that would be mine and not mine because nothing we make is ever only ours. There would be a sign that said Back Steps in letters I would probably paint wrong the first time and then leave like that because perfection is boring. There would be mornings when the stove ran hot and evenings when the curd lined up in jars like good soldiers and nights when the gulls forgot my name and I learned not to mind because I had enough other names to answer to.\n\n\u201cAre you happy?\u201d Renee asked, not as an accusation but as a line you could tie a boat to.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d I said. \u201cMore often when there\u2019s butter.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmart girl,\u201d she said. \u201cBring your people here on Saturdays if you like. We can teach a lot of ladies with sharp elbows how not to cut scones like murderers.\u201d\n\nWe laughed because it was the right noise. We ate another scone because life is short and then long and then complicated, and you need to have something in your hands for all of it. The day didn\u2019t clap or bow or take our picture. It did the better thing. It stayed.Chapter 7\n\nThe week after we found each other in a hall that smelled like varnish and old biscuits, the world began to behave as if it had been watching us decide. Papers appeared that wanted my full name in block letters and my grandmother\u2019s maiden name like a test I hadn\u2019t studied for. The market manager in Matakana sent a cheery email with a PDF attached that looked friendly until it mentioned food safety, access to potable water, and whether I owned a gazebo that wouldn\u2019t murder a child if the wind got ambitious. Kahu put his thesis into a drawer like a lover he\u2019d promised to call and pulled out a dry-erase marker with the lust of a man who\u2019d been waiting his whole life to draw a Gantt chart. He wrote Back Steps across the top of the whiteboard on our fridge in letters that got bolder with each loop, then stood back with his arms crossed like a small, pleased god.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bakery,\u201d he said, as if correcting a child. \u201cIt\u2019s a project. A kaupapa. A moving kitchen. A way to make people less annoyed at mornings.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a table,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd my job is to make sure there\u2019s enough to put on it.\u201d\n\nHe nodded with the seriousness of a man who did not plan to let gravity get in the way of his enthusiasm. He assigned himself the task of sign procurement and logo design with a flourish, then reached for his phone to text three friends who all had opinions about fonts. We learned that there are arguments you cannot avoid if you love anything: what to call the shade of green that says leaf and not toothpaste, whether a macron should sit above a letter if you cannot guarantee the printer will respect it, how many gulls you can draw before it becomes a children\u2019s book. The sign arrived a week later, painted by someone in Grey Lynn who\u2019d done bands and barbershops and one wedding he refused to be held responsible for. BACK STEPS, it said, in a hand that looked like it would swear for you if necessary. The S leaned into the P as if sharing a secret.\n\nRenee travelled up on a Friday with a sack of lemons from a tree that had decided to be generous and a list of people she thought we should ask for help. She wrote their names on an envelope with her thumb pressed against the paper like she could steady the future through friction. She had a way of leaning on the bench with her hip that made every kitchen she entered look like it had been waiting; when the kettle boiled, she tilted her head to listen as if it were about to sing something particular for her. We worked through the food safety check with the sort of laughing that makes inspectors less inclined to reject you. The man from the council was gentle and alarmingly thorough. He wanted to know if my thermometers were calibrated, whether I had a handwashing setup that would function even if the power cut without warning, whether my wiping cloths were of a colour that wouldn\u2019t hide blood if I did something stupid to myself. He watched me wash my hands as if he had been asked to write a sonnet about it. By the time he left, he had a bag of lemon slices and the knowledge that we would not poison anyone on purpose.\n\nThe first Saturday was a rehearsal for a life. We loaded Cherry with tables, an Esky full of curd and cream and butter that had all the excitement of a hen party on a ferry, a stack of brown paper bags we\u2019d stamped with the new logo until the kitchen smelled like ink, and three dozen scones Renee called insurance. The sign fit in the backseat like a passenger, and I buckled it in because I didn\u2019t trust physics. At the market, the air had the feel of a poem that had been rewritten until it could be read out loud without making its owner blush. Stalls lined up and pretended to be orderly. Someone sold candles with names like Quiet Field and Monday Morning; someone else had knitted child-sized hats with ears that would ruin them for life in the best way; a beekeeper stood behind a run of jars like he was offering parts of the sun for a reasonable price and told everyone who paused that his girls were in a good mood today. The woman at the end wore a T-shirt that said BREAD IS MY LOVE LANGUAGE and thick socks and a smile that made me want to hand her all my secrets.\n\nWe set up the gazebo with the clumsiness of people who have never triangulated anything. The wind came across the vines with the intention of reminding us it had been here first. A man appeared as if conjured, tightened a knob Kahu had been wooing for fifteen minutes, drove a peg into a patch of ground that had ideas about staying inviolate, and faded back into the general population with a nod. I made a chalkboard menu in handwriting that would have made my year ten teacher sigh. Back Steps: feijoa lemon tartlets, scones with jam and condensed milk, hyped-up lamingtons, shortbread like you forgot to behave, coffee from Lena\u2019s machine if the power fairy stays with us. Renee added and a slice of something if we don\u2019t eat it first in a neat slope to the corner. We put the plate of samples at the front and the spoon in the jar of curd within my arm\u2019s reach as if I were offering communion. The gulls did a low reconnaissance pass, then decided we were either not generous or not interesting and went to harass a child who had unwrapped a muesli bar with the assurance of the unafraid.\n\nPeople came. That first hour tasted like a childhood birthday party where everyone actually turns up. The early risers with their canvas bags and opinions on tomatoes stopped and nodded as if we had met somewhere else in a life with better lighting. The kids came for the lamingtons and stayed to argue about what feijoa tastes like to people who think they hate it. One woman bought six tartlets and told me they were for a book club that read crime novels but always ended up talking about neighbours, and that she had once tried to kiss a man while holding a pavlova and it had ended in tragedy. An old man with a cap that had seen carbon-something war asked if I sold custard squares and when I said not yet, he bought shortbread as if forgiving me. Lena turned up with her hair tucked under a cap because the wind refused to play nice, set up a plug-in coffee exterior to our stall, and began issuing flat whites like absolution. By mid-morning, I had the specific ache in my lower back that means you are alive and doing something that matters to you, and my hands had begun to smell permanently like lemon, sugar, and something like courage.\n\nA woman with a lanyard that said HEALTH in capital letters came by and summarized our business plan by the way she kept her mouth soft while her eyes did their inspections. She asked me about temperature logs and holding times and whether I had a separate utensil for raw and cooked, and my heart did not climb into my throat because I had kept my promise to myself about control where there is control to be had. She told me her favourite dessert was jelly that pretends it\u2019s grown-up, then bought a lamington and ate it like she had earned it. I tucked the first real stack of notes into the little tin we kept in a paper bag under the table and did not think too hard about whether this was security or superstition. Kahu ran crowd control for us with a clipboard and a smile that made people say yes to standing where he put them. He had made a pre-order list that made me want to cry from relief. He had also, I discovered later that afternoon, quietly told two teenagers who had turned feral in the queue that if they wanted to fight, they could fight him, and then made them hold our spare pegs while he told them they were hired.\n\nAfter lunch, the sky remembered that weather in this country does not ask for permission. The marquee line shivered like a thing having a thought, and a single, fat drop landed on the corner of my chalkboard and smudged the word lemon into something that looked briefly like lonely. I wanted to call it an omen and then told myself to grow up. Then the wind came sideways, ambitious and rude, and lifted one leg of the gazebo with a smoothness that made my spine behave like a wire. The teacups rattled like a warning. The scones considered committing seppuku. Renee said, without raising her voice, \u201cHand me that spoon and the guy rope,\u201d in a way that made me grin even while I ran for both. The beekeeper appeared at my elbow with a weight that had once been a brick and now was a solution. Between us, and the helpful man who had pegged us earlier and now materialized with a face like a farmer\u2019s weather report, we battened the thing down with the confidence of people who had been blown around by bigger forces and were still here to tell stories.\n\nIt rained properly for seven minutes. Properly as in loudly and with an enthusiasm generally reserved for baptisms and late trains. We laughed in the way you do when you can hear your own ridiculousness and can\u2019t do anything about it. People queued anyway; there is nothing more stubborn than a New Zealander in wet socks looking at a pastry. The shortbread kept its dignity. The lamingtons did what they always do and took on the weather like it was a personality trait. A child in a yellow raincoat that made them look like a lemon with opinions announced to the line at large that they were five and had eaten four lamingtons and their mother was not to be told, and seven strangers conspired to become complicit. At some point, someone put a hot hand around my upper arm and when I turned, Jules was there, rain squinting into their eyes, a beanie flattened against their head like a bird that had made peace with being wet. They had flown up in the morning because they had never learned the trick of resisting a good story that needed a pair of hands.\n\n\u201cYour tent is flirting with me,\u201d they said. \u201cIt keeps lifting its skirt and showing me its ankles. I brought secret brownies. They\u2019re for you and nobody else because I\u2019m stingy about my love.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve come all this way to bribe me,\u201d I said, taking the Tupperware like I had never been given anything worth holding.\n\n\u201cI came to work,\u201d they said, already taking a towel to the counter the way a good friend will put their hands on a thing without being asked. \u201cAnd to tell you, because I remember how it feels, that you\u2019re allowed to sit down for exactly five minutes right now and you will not die and the world will not catch fire.\u201d\n\nI sat. I did not die. The world continued to go on being too much and just enough. The brownies were obscene and restorative and tasted like dark chocolate married to salt in a way that made me consider writing a congratulations card. Jules ran interference with a woman who wanted to argue about whether the coconut should be toasted and parried her in two languages until she was smiling like a person who remembered she had come here because food makes mornings kind. We closed with the sort of relief that is not unmixed, because relief never is in lives like this. The last tartlet went to a girl with a skateboard under her arm who said lemon tasted like the part of the afternoon where you don\u2019t have to be anywhere yet. The last scone went to a man in hi-vis who told us he\u2019d been on night shift and didn\u2019t trust the sun anymore, and we told him to trust butter instead and he said he\u2019d give it a go.\n\nAt home that night, I counted money in little stacks as if numbers looked better in tidy groups and could be convinced of their manners. The take would not save us from the price of Auckland, but it would pay for next Saturday\u2019s butter without my stomach becoming a knot that woke me at three. There were messages on the Back Steps page from people who wanted us at their school fundraisers and their office parties and their aunties\u2019 birthdays. There were also two notes offering to tell me what I should have done differently, and I read them with the careful attention you give your own bad dreams, then told them to wait their turn and shut the door. I ran a bath that convinced me I could forgive my feet for their day, and I thought about the room at the hospice where Mrs. Healy had told me to salt my butter and eat even when I did not want to, and I ate anyway because ghosts are right about so many things. When I came out, the sign leaned against the wall like it had learned how to hold the room, and Kahu was asleep on the couch under a blanket Mrs. Kline had knit with a pattern she refused to reveal.\n\nOn Tuesday, there was a memorial in the hospice courtyard that smelled like lemon gel and cut grass and the hard sweetness of chrysanthemums. We put Mrs. Healy\u2019s name on a sheet and the pen left a line that would be permanent in a book someone\u2019s grandchild would hold in fifty years and say, Who was she. I spoke about scones and about a woman who would tell pain to sit down and have some tea if it wanted to stay. I said grief was a second language I had learned at the age when you are supposed to be learning your times tables and that I was tired and grateful in equal measure. The knitting ladies sat in a row like a choir and one of them sang a grace in a voice that had rubbed against a lot of air. Coco stood by the table where we put our plates and said, Take as much as you can carry, because food is the only appropriate inheritance we offer here. When we went back inside to the small bustle of the living, the hallway seemed to widen to let us through. I stood in the kitchen for a minute and put my hands on the bench and thought, as I always do in kitchens where the air has held grief, about what comes next that is small and doable.\n\nAfter, business grew like a scruffy hedge that no council would discourage because it kept the wind off the neighbours. We made markets a habit and then, to our alarm, a reputation. People started saying we were their Saturday on the way to something else, which is a compliment you should write on your wall if you get it. I learned how to say no to the man who wanted me to bake his girlfriend a cake shaped like a jet ski, and yes to the nan in Sandringham who wanted me to show her mokopuna how to cut butter into flour without making it cross. Renee drove up every second weekend with a bag of lemons that made my back complain and a list of stories she had stored up like fruit in a pantry. She told me she had been in a house with a girl called Rua who had taught her how to braid bread with eyes shut, and in another house where she had taught a boy called Sam to make a roux that didn\u2019t clump and he had cried when it did what it was supposed to because he was twenty-three and no one had believed him about anything else.\n\nWe started the Saturday classes with a budget like a thrift shop and a thirst like a drought. The hall in Whakat\u0101ne agreed to let us use the kitchen if we cleaned it better than we found it and left scones for the caretaker. In Auckland, the community centre unlocked the doors with the kind of generosity that comes from being used to your own heart being broken. The first class, a handful of women arrived with sharp elbows and sharper laughter, a man who had come because his grandkid had called him out on burning toast, two teenagers with chipped nail polish and eyes that did not leave the counter because they had learned that looking up could make you a target, and a lawyer who whispered to me that she ate biscuits in her car because she could not go home yet, sometimes, and is that a normal thing to admit to a stranger. We put flour on everyone\u2019s hands because there is no way to keep flour off you that doesn\u2019t involve lies. Mangling a dough together is both skill and rite, and watching people learn the texture of togetherness makes you feel like a thief who has been allowed to keep what she stole.\n\nRenee and I developed a patter that would have been a double act if we had rehearsed it. She did the part where she told them to fold it like you meant the apology, and I did the part where I made them stop when their faces turned into the faces of their mothers. We handed people a knife who had not been handed anything sharp with trust, ever, and watched their shoulders come down when nothing bad happened and the butter behaved. We did a class at the hospice for the nurses and the women who had been there longer than the nurses, a class where salt was measured by sentence and sugar by story. Coco rolled pastry like she was smoothing people into their beds, and Mrs. Kline showed up with Beethoven in the harness only to direct traffic from a chair and tell everyone to watch their corners like a general. At the end of the first cycle, we stood on the back steps with paper plates and the kind of look between us that says we are doing a thing we meant to do and how ridiculous is that.\n\nThe practicalities behaved in their own messy way. I learned how to order butter wholesale without crying, how to asterisk my invoices so they would be seen by people whose inboxes were always on fire, how to speak to the woman in Council who held the power to deny me electricity with the respect due to a queen. Tasi built me a box that held the generator like a spoiled child and could be locked with a look. He came to the market one Saturday with his niece and bought two lamingtons and one scone and a coffee he pronounced good in the way you do when you love someone and are not going to lie to them. Kahu\u2019s thesis came back with comments and he wrote them like a man who had been asked to sand a floor for the third time and decided to do it barefoot. He told me in the kitchen at midnight that sometimes he counted the chairs in our flat still, reflexive and unnecessary, and we laughed because neither of us needed the number anymore and that felt like winning something.\n\nThe letter turned up on a Wednesday that was tired of pretending to be Tuesday. It was in an envelope that had been addressed by someone with a long-standing love affair with cursive. The stamp was a wahine with hair like a wave. No return address. Inside, a single sheet of paper, blue-inked and careful, that began with my name and did not commit to any claims about me beyond that. It said, in a hand that had learned long ago how to be careful with its loops, that there had once been a woman in Ponsonby who baked quietly and hoped loudly, who had loved scones as if they could save people and believed that flour did not ask too many questions. It said the woman\u2019s name as if I would recognize it and I did not, and then it said a second name, one my bones knew: Aunty Moana had kept other names for other people, and if I wanted to find the woman who had laughed at the gas oven like a miracle, I might try the block of flats on Norfolk Street where the man at Number Five collected bottle caps and left them on his windowsill in neat rows. It was not a promise. It was a nudge. Sometimes that is better. The signature at the bottom was a squiggle that belonged to someone who had not decided if she would be known.\n\nI held the letter and thought about what it costs to go backwards. You don\u2019t get to take the body you have now into a room where you were small. You must decide whether you are old enough to disappoint someone who might expect a child. I rang Jules and told them I had been given a puzzle in a country already full of puzzles, and they told me to remember that grief and joy both think they own the letterbox. I put the letter on the fridge behind the magnet that held the directions to the vineyard once and now held a list of who needed to be called about the next class. Then I called the number at the bottom, and it rang twice and then someone\u2019s breath answered like a door opening in a house I had never lived in.\n\n\u201cIs this Nia,\u201d she asked, in a voice that smelled like tea, \u201cNia who bakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I said, and the sound I made was not a laugh but had the honesty of one. \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who told your Renee she didn\u2019t know what she was doing,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAnd then watched her do it. My name is very old and not interesting. My nephew lives downstairs and he watches your show repeatedly. I live upstairs and I watch my neighbours. If you want to come sit and watch me watch them, bring biscuits. If you don\u2019t, then disregard. I am not above being ignored by the young.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never been good at ignoring instruction,\u201d I said. \u201cI can come Thursday. Is there anything you hate besides raisins?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate men who talk during the notices at the beginning of the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd people who put fondant on cakes when what cake wants is frosting or nothing. Bring whatever you bring. The man at Number Five won\u2019t answer the bell. He\u2019s shy because he pretends he smoked once when he didn\u2019t. Knock on the door to the right. I\u2019m the one with too many plants and an opinion on everything.\u201d\n\nWe went on Thursday. Kahu insisted on coming because he likes to meet the narrators of my life, and because he had a superstition about me walking into places with long hallways alone. Norfolk Street was that part of the city that remembers when it was more tired and less expensive. The block of flats had seen people arrive with suitcases and leave with debts and love. The stairwell smelled like damp carpet and curry and bleach that had done its best. On the landing, the bottle caps shone like small moons. A cat that had not signed a lease tried to trip us and then decided against it. A woman opened the door before we knocked and stood with her hand on her hip as if balancing the block with that one hinge in her body. Bo, she said her name was, Bo like a tie, Bo like a tilt of the head, Bo like a person who would keep a secret for the right reasons.\n\nShe had a couch that had held six lives. She had plants that had learned to grow toward a window that did not promise them anything. She had a photograph on a shelf of a woman with a scar by her eyebrow laughing at a girl holding a spoon like a joke. She made us tea and poured it high, and called me girl twice and child once and Kahu boy in a way that wasn\u2019t diminishment, only a reminder that we were not as old as our worries. She told me she had known a man who had been in love with my mother once, long ago, and that this was not a story that ended with me at her door. She told me my mother had a way of leaving that looked like arriving because she always turned when she went, and sometimes that confused people into thinking she had stayed. She told me she had seen her ten years back on a bus going to Henderson with a bag of oranges and a look like she\u2019d been told she could raise someone else\u2019s child for a week.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to say she was good,\u201d Bo asked, not unkind. \u201cDo you want to hate her? Do you want me to tell you the shape of her mouth when she said your name because the truth is I don\u2019t know if she ever did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want the part that is true,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd maybe a direction to face when I wake up at three.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing about mothers is they are people,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that\u2019s blasphemy in some countries. She stood outside herself and didn\u2019t always go back in. Renee went back in. Some people do. It is not noble. It is a choice. That is worse. You can\u2019t blame a disease for it.\u201d\n\nWe ate the biscuits I had brought, which had been meant to be shortbread and had turned into something else because I had been thinking too hard about the butter. Bo approved with the severity of a teacher and then leaned on her window sill to watch a man in a hat feed pigeons outside the dairy. She gave me two more names and the advice that if I got to a door and the person behind it wouldn\u2019t look me in the face, I could look at their hands instead because hands don\u2019t lie without telling on themselves. She told me if I found her, my mother, to not expect her to be grateful for being found, and if I didn\u2019t, to stop thinking that failing to find a person is the same as failing to be one.\n\nWhen we left, the gulls were arguing with a rubbish bin like the bin had started it. Kahu stood under the Norfolk pine that had done time as a Christmas tree in a hundred letterboxes and looked at me like he was asking if I was a house he could check the weatherboards on. I leaned against him because my legs weren\u2019t sure who they were supposed to be at that hour. We went to Lena\u2019s and stood behind the machine while she made three coffees with the concentration of a surgeon and pretended not to want to ask what the woman had said. I told her anyway, in pieces that had to be fitted together to make any sense. The world did not clap. It did the better thing and kept being itself. The afternoon turned into the kind where the clouds take up a strong opinion about who the sky belongs to, and I put my apron on and my list down and let my hands do what they know while my head went somewhere with a letter and a staircase and a photo and a woman who laughed as if failure could be baked out of flour if you loved it hard enough.\n\nBusiness got busier and then got complicated in ways money has a way of inventing. An influencer with teeth like an advertisement came to a market and took photographs with our sign and my hands and announced to a world I was not in the habit of visiting that Back Steps was the new thing and that I seemed \u201cauthentically local, like a pie on a long bus trip.\u201d Orders exploded in a way that would have looked perfect in a montage. I spent nights counting eggs and lost the thread on three conversations in a day because the part of my brain that tracks almond deliveries was shouting over the part that noticed people\u2019s faces. Kahu said the words hire someone with the gravity some men use to say I love you and I pretended to ignore him and then did it, because he was right and because my shoulders had started to forget down. Our someone was a woman named Sila who smelled permanently of coriander, had a laugh that removed splinters, and could balance six plates on her forearm like a circus act while telling a story about a man who had come into her restaurant every Friday for a year to order the same thing and how when he died, she had made a plate for him anyway and put it on the corner table and let it get cold.\n\nWe let Back Steps be more than the stall. We made Wednesday nights at the hall something, too, a place where you could come with nothing and leave with a biscuit and maybe a recipe that would make you less afraid of yourself for ten minutes. We put a little jar by the door with a sign that said Give if you can, Take if you need, and a list of things we would trade baking for: a ride to the hospice, a guitar lesson for the kid with the skateboard, an hour of babysitting for the lawyer who needed a date with no law in it, a crochet lesson for Kahu because he had decided his thesis would be better if his fingers learned new patience. The jar behaved like a tide. Some weeks it was too full to lift. Some weeks it was empty and so were we and then someone would put two coins in it in a way that made me look away and think about jamming and generosity and how close they sit together in the mouth.\n\nThe night the power went out just as I was about to pull the tart shells and the kitchen filled with the kind of pitch that makes your bones hum, Jules lit three candles with the solemnity of a priest and said the sentence that heard the room take a breath: \u201cWe know how to bake by feel.\u201d We finished by touch and by ear and stood on the back steps with a tray of tarts that had survived their own making and ate them with fingers and we remembered the old trick of licking sugar off our knuckles like we had invented it. When the lights came back on, everyone clapped in that automatic way people clap for electricity, as if apologizing to it for forgetting it is a miracle.\n\nThings kept arriving. A letter from a school in \u014ctara asking if I\u2019d speak to a class about finding a life you don\u2019t have to apologize for on Mondays. A message from a man in Australia who watched me on television while he fed his daughter at three a.m. and cried into her hair because his mother had made lamingtons for funerals and nobody did anymore where he was. A small, serious boy in a Star Wars T-shirt who came to the stall three weeks running with a coin exactly counted out and asked if I had ever thought of putting Milo in biscuit dough, and when I laughed and said we could try, he looked at me like I had given him a spare room. A woman with a shaved head who listened to me explain feijoa curd and then leaned across the table and told me in the voice you use when you\u2019re brave that she hadn\u2019t tasted anything in six months and maybe this would be the thing that brought her back to herself. It did. She came back the next week and cried so quietly about it that the world didn\u2019t notice. We did.\n\nWhen we went back to the vineyard for a charity event, I put my hand on the same tent pole just to see if it remembered me. It shivered like a friend you pass in a supermarket who\u2019s trying to work out where you know each other from. The air had different names and the vines had grown like people who\u2019d made decisions. Someone asked me to speak into a microphone and I did it like I hadn\u2019t once been the girl who learned to make herself as small as a spoon. Later, standing by the car with the boot open and the night finally remembering to be dark, Arjun called from a place with snow in the corner of the window and told me he had a kitchen with a bench that didn\u2019t wobble and a child who had decided bread was both food and toy. Maia sent a photo of a tray of fried bread her aunties had commandeered and said, Come over; and promised me a corner of a table to sit in while the women told me things I could not hear anywhere else.\n\nOn a Sunday afternoon that had decided to be a bowl rather than a plate, I sat on our own back step with my knees up and the city doing that low hum it does when it is not trying to impress anybody. Renee called from Whakat\u0101ne to tell me she\u2019d burned a batch of jam and salvaged it with whiskey because life is nothing if not an argument with sugar. Kahu read me a paragraph of his thesis that made my breath do a trick and then pretended he had made me cry by accident. I licked a smear of curd off my thumb and looked at the line of ants investigating a crumb and thought, with the calm of a person who has had enough and not enough, that I had made a place that looked like me and that the world had decided, for the moment, to sit down. The gull on the fencepost opened its beak with malice and affection both and screamed in two notes that were almost, but not quite, my name. Somewhere in the pile of papers on the table behind me, a letter waited with a name on it that had always been mine. Somewhere down the street, a woman was hanging out washing and thinking about bread. Somewhere in a hall that smelled of varnish and old biscuits, someone would come on Saturday with their sharp elbows, and I would put flour on their hands, and together we would turn a bowl of ingredients into something you could eat, which has always been my favourite magic.Chapter 9\n\nBy late winter, the city had decided to practice spring in little bursts, like a child testing the water with a toe and fleeing squealing. The morning light came early enough to catch me peering into mixing bowls like they had advice to give. Back Steps had settled into a rhythm that made sense to my ribs. Mondays were inventory and lists and accepting that butter cost what it cost no matter how nicely you asked. Tuesdays were deliveries and the kind of cleaning you do when you pretend you\u2019re thinking about something else. Wednesdays were the hall classes that turned strangers into people who corrected each other\u2019s flour measurements gently. Thursdays were for experimenting and burning a tray of something on purpose just to remember it happens. Fridays, Renee would arrive with a bag of lemons and a story, and Saturdays were the market, where we put on our best selves and then forgave each other when we were our second-best.\n\nThe school in \u014ctara wrote again and did the thing I respect most in a request: they put times and names and a room number in the subject line. I said yes because I wanted to plant a seed in a building that knew about storms. Kahu pretended he wasn\u2019t coming and then turned up in the doorway of my room with a stack of handouts he had designed that made the act of cutting butter look like a religious rite. We loaded the car with bowls and a bag of flour and two boxes of shortbread that had turned out odd because the oven had run hotter than usual and would therefore be radical and unforgettable. Cherry, having been spoken to sternly and bribed with a new air freshener that smelled more like laundry than lies, started obediently on the second try.\n\nThe classroom smelled exactly like every classroom I have ever loved and resented: whiteboard marker, too many backpacks, and somebody\u2019s lunch trying to make friends. The kids were a mix of sharp elbows and practiced slouches, hoodies and hair gel and eyes with the old look. The teacher had the tolerance of a woman who had chosen this life on purpose and leaned on the back bench with her hands, not her hip, as if the room were a boat and she knew where to stand. We talked about baking like it was a language that would let you visit without embarrassment. I told them the secret of scones was to treat the dough like a creature you could startle and that the way you hold a knife tells the world how you\u2019ve been held. A boy at the back who wore his hair like he had cut it himself asked if I was on that show, and when I admitted it, he grinned with too many teeth and said, \u201cMy nan hates you for what you said about jam,\u201d and I told him to tell his nan that I would duel her with curd anytime and he laughed so hard he fell off his chair and then put himself back on it with dignity.\n\nWe rubbed butter into flour, and the room got quiet in that way that means everyone\u2019s hands are occupied and the body remembers that stillness is not laziness. A girl with bitten nails pressed the dough with the heel of her hand and then looked at me like she\u2019d been caught, and I said, \u201cGentler,\u201d and her shoulders dropped three centimeters like I\u2019d handed her a warmer coat. We took the trays to the canteen oven and the lunch lady, who had seen more chaos than any of us, told me she\u2019d never liked scones because they were dry and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s make you a liar.\u201d When the smell moved through the corridor, a man in a tie appeared at the door with the look of someone who often has to ask for money and is sometimes given it, and we fed him with the rest. The children ate and licked their thumbs and tried the word \u201csable\u201d on their tongues and discovered it tasted like sand if you said it as if you didn\u2019t respect French. When it was time to go, a girl with plaits counted out exact change for a lamington as if paying me gave her permission to enjoy it, and the teacher put her hand on my arm and said, \u201cCome back,\u201d and I said I would and meant it with my whole chest.\n\nBack at the hall that evening, Jules leaned their hip against the bench and told a story about a caf\u00e9 that had installed a slide instead of stairs because the owner thought fun and coffee should be adjacent and how within a week everyone had broken a tailbone and no one could tell if it was because of joy or bad design. They had decided to stay in Auckland for a while because Christchurch had been hard on them in a quiet, efficient way. There was a spare room in a flat in Kingsland where the shower was either arctic or hell and the neighbours played the saxophone at reasonable volumes, which somehow makes it worse. I wanted them closer the way you want someone else to turn up to a thing you\u2019re nervous about without having to ask. We baked a batch of biscuits with Milo just because a boy had asked, and they came out the exact shade of school lost property, a taste like the quiet part of the afternoon on a carpet you used to hate. When we put them on a plate, Kahu stole one, pronounced it a cultural moment, and drafted a plan to letterbox the recipe around the neighbourhood like urgent political literature.\n\nThe letter from the council about the stall permit renewal arrived with a form attached that seemed to have been designed by a man who had never stepped outside. Somewhere between the sections titled HYGIENE PRACTICES and APPROVED WATER SOURCE ASSURANCES was a line that asked if I had access to inclement weather. I wrote yes because there was nowhere to write obviously. The health inspector came again, less stern this time, and admired our handwashing station like a friend. She told me someone had complained to her that our lamingtons were too generous and she had written back, \u201cFind a better adjective,\u201d which made me trust her for life. She also told me there\u2019d been a butter shortage brewing like a quiet storm and advised me to spread my orders across suppliers in a way that suggested she had rescued more stalls than mine. I started buying butter like canned peaches in wartime and learned my wrists could carry more than I had given them credit for.\n\nBo phoned on a Wednesday when I was halfway through burning a batch of candied peel. The sound of her voice on my mobile made my spine think I was at a payphone. She had that calm that sometimes means there\u2019s a sting at the end. \u201cYour mother,\u201d she said, dispensing with the part where we pretend this is casual gossip about a neighbour\u2019s boyfriend, \u201chas been seen at the op shop at the end of Richmond Road. Mondays. Helping with the bags no one wants to carry. She wears a scarf even when it\u2019s warm. The girl who told me has the kind of memory I don\u2019t argue with. If you go, don\u2019t expect anything that tidy. And eat first, so you don\u2019t behave like a person who hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI put the phone down and stood in the kitchen for longer than the situation warranted, but grief and hope both ask for stillness where you might give them movement. I told Kahu by leaving the kettle on and sitting at the table without touching a pencil. He made tea and didn\u2019t ask if I was sure, because neither of us had the right to that question. I told Renee by sending her three lemon emojis and a picture of my left hand, the one with the knuckle I busted when I was thirteen and slammed it into a door that was not the problem. She replied with a single word\u2014Steady\u2014and a photo of her own hand with the scar by the eyebrow in the background. Jules arrived without knocking because doors mean different things to people who have had to hold them shut. They sat with me and made a list that had exactly six items: eat an actual meal, don\u2019t go alone, bring very small biscuits, say your name out loud first, don\u2019t rescue anyone, breathe even if it feels like you\u2019re stealing air.\n\nWe went on a Monday because spell and habit are cousins. The op shop had the smell of old coats and the generosity of old ladies making do. The racks were packed with clothes that had seen better rooms and were willing to try again. A staff member with purple hair and a nose ring that said she\u2019d probably volunteer at three different things told us that if we were here to dump a bag outside after hours, we could go straight to jail. I told her we were here to buy a teapot with a chip and she laughed like she was pleased to meet a liar. The scarves were in a basket, the kind you have to rustle to let them know you mean it. She was there, not as a miracle and not as an apparition, but as a woman folding jeans on a table the way you fold conversations you can\u2019t have anymore. Her hair had that half-gone look bleach gives when it refuses to flatter you. The scarf was green with little white flowers like punctuation.\n\nThere weren\u2019t trumpets. There was a carefulness. I said her name like it was a word I had checked the pronunciation of, and she looked up like a person who has learned to expect their name to be spoken when something needs doing. Her face did the computations you do when a stranger arrives carrying half of you in their eyes. She took a step and then a half-step back like the floor had changed levels and didn\u2019t warn her. I held the bag of biscuits too tight and then loosened my hands because my fingers are not responsible for other people\u2019s choices. We went outside because op shops are poor places to let a history unfold. On the street, we were two women with nothing to hide behind except a bin and the sky. She said, \u201cNia,\u201d and I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and that took the breath out of me more than anything else would have.\n\nShe told me she had left because she had thought it was kinder to stop trying when trying hurt. She told me there was a day she\u2019d stood outside a house and counted to ten a hundred times and gone home without knocking because she didn\u2019t have anything to put in the room that wouldn\u2019t stain. She told me she had lied about where she was so long her mouth had worn a groove, and she was trying to wear a new one now. She said my name again like she was learning how old I\u2019d become without the benefit of watching. I told her about Renee without giving away what wasn\u2019t mine to tell. I told her about Mrs. Healy and the tent and the market and the hall and the gulls. I didn\u2019t give her the small facts that would let her think she knew me without doing the work, like the way I sleep with one foot out of the duvet because it feels like a compromise. She told me she worked mornings and sometimes afternoons and always slept with the radio on. She did not promise me anything and I did not ask.\n\nI gave her the biscuits because my hands needed to do something that wasn\u2019t tuck a child into bed years too late. She laughed when she saw them because they were Milo and she had a story about leaving a boy with a mug and a spoon and a warning about ants and coming back to find him sleeping on his arm at the table with a moustache that would not wipe away. Then the laugh and the story turned back into the air, where they came from. She had a room, she said, off Ponsonby Road, a place you can hear other people\u2019s lives through a wall, and it kept her honest. She asked if this was where I wanted to stop or start, and I said I didn\u2019t know, which was true. We agreed to pick a day and an hour and not to give it too much shape. On the way home, I spoke to the wind, because it would not tell anyone, and told it that I had done the brave thing without knowing if I would get a reward. It told me, in that way that weather talks, that the reward is a different question.\n\nThe next weeks bled like a nose you forgot to tilt your head forward for. We met once in a caf\u00e9 where the seats were bolted down as if someone had tried to leave with a bench before. We drank tea and talked around the edges. She had my eyelashes and a way of not finishing a sentence that made me want to pick it up and put it back in her mouth, which I didn\u2019t, because I am not a surgeon and the wound didn\u2019t belong to me. She told me a story about the time she had saved a cake by pretending she always meant for it to be a trifle. I told her I make curd like it\u2019s a way to smuggle summer into winter. We parted like colleagues at the end of a shift, polite without being false. I went home and made marmalade until my kitchen looked like a science experiment, and when it set, I wrote her name on a jar and put it at the back of the cupboard and told myself she would ask for it one day and also that she might not.\n\nIn the middle of all that, life kept insisting on itself rudely. Kahu defended his thesis on a Wednesday morning with a fever that would have made a wiser man reschedule. He wore a shirt I recognized from a party we\u2019d gone to where the chips had been stingy and people had been stingier. He stood in a room with bad carpet and explained the price of water and the ways it gets into a body and the language we use to pretend we don\u2019t know who it belongs to, and he did not once use the word journey even when they gave him an opening the size of a paddock. He came out with a look on his face like he had been holding up a roof and now someone else had finally got a hand under it. We went straight from the university to the market and made the kind of scones that get confused for communion, and he told everyone who would listen that the planet had not been saved by his document and that was not the point.\n\nMrs. Kline had a fall on a Thursday, the kind that looks small until the next morning. She left me a note under my door in handwriting that wobbled but made it across the page like a determined canoe. It said, in the way a general might tell you to fix your hair, that she\u2019d had a disagreement with the rug and the rug had won and could I please go to the dairy and tell Mr. Singh to let her pay him later for the eggs because she did not intend to stop making pancakes at her age just to please time. I went up. Beethoven blinked at me with the disdain of a creature who has never fallen, then put his paw on my knee as if to remind me of my role on this earth. We made pancakes together, the kind with too much baking soda because she insists it keeps you upright, and she told me about a girl who\u2019d come to her door at midnight seven years ago crying and how she\u2019d made that girl sit down and eat toast and then washed the girl\u2019s hair like it was a spell. It was new information and old. She told me she had written to a cousin in Napier who once knew how to find a man in a pub in Tauranga, because that\u2019s how you find people in this country, and did I want her to put out the word or was that me taking too much in both hands. I said to put out the word. She nodded and said, \u201cGood girl,\u201d and the words landed on my bones like a blanket.\n\nSila took to Back Steps like she\u2019d been waiting to be told where to put the trays. She organized the Esky with the ruthless thoughtfulness of someone who had raised three children and one teenager who wasn\u2019t hers on a budget that would make anyone else mean. She told me I didn\u2019t charge enough for the tartlets and I told her to stop being my father, and she looked at me like I had revealed more than I meant to and then told me I was doing the math wrong and I knew that she was right so I printed new cards with numbers that made me feel like a thief and then remembered that paying rent does not make you a villain. Sila brought her sister one Saturday, a nurse with hands that could hypnotize a child, and between them they moved the queue so gracefully people thought they were dancing and put money in the jar.\n\nWind found us again the day we were invited to set up on a corner of the farmers\u2019 market where the fancy stalls were. The vendor who sold very good salt with words on the packet came over and introduced herself without a single insult, which made me suspicious. We had just got the gazebo to stop behaving like a kite when the sky changed clothes. The stall ropes sang like people who don\u2019t know the words and the air moved through the vines like gossip. The wind took the chalkboard and sent it three stalls down. Jules chased it and came back with it under their arm, hair in their eyes, yelling that the wind had asked for a discount and they had told it to get bent. We held the tent down with everything that wasn\u2019t nailed to the soil. The beekeeper showed up with more weights because apparently he lives for bad weather. A teenage boy from the stall that sells apples put his shoulders under one leg of our gazebo and stood there for seven minutes and never mentioned it later, which is how you know someone has been raised to think being useful is a language.\n\nAfter the storm, the air felt like a drunk who had decided to apologize. The customers came back in that way where they pretend they weren\u2019t waiting across the road calculating the risk of damp coconut. We sold out of shortbread because everyone in a five-kilometre radius had decided they were owed sugar for surviving. I put a pair of lamingtons aside because a boy had come early with exact change and asked me to save them, and when he came back three hours later with a bandage on his knee and a look like he\u2019d lost a race with a kerb, I handed them over as if we had planned this together. He told me he had stood in the rain because lamingtons taste better if your socks are wet, and I told him I would put that on a T-shirt and he said to make sure I credited him, and we shook on it.\n\nThe television people called about a segment on small businesses with not enough money and too much heart. I told them to bring their own extension cord. Poppy came along with a lanyard even though we weren\u2019t on her show anymore because she had caught the disease and couldn\u2019t stop being helpful. She pointed their cameras at Sila, at the Esky, at the jar by the door that said Give if you can, Take if you need, and a microphone at my mouth that tried to make me say things I didn\u2019t mean. I talked about butter and grief and why toast is sometimes the only dinner that does the job, and then they filmed a slow shot of honey dripping off a spoon as if it were a metaphor and I tried not to roll my eyes. When I got home, there was a message from a woman in Balclutha with a photo of her kitchen and a paragraph about her mother\u2019s hands and the way her mother had taught her to count in a language the radio never used. She had never thought to put feijoa in curd, she said. She had always thought it would taste like an argument. She tried it and said it tasted like her auntie telling her to be brave and not look foolish. I wrote back and told her that was sometimes the same thing.\n\nOn a Sunday, I went to the hall in Whakat\u0101ne because I had promised and because promises are a kind of axle. Renee was there with the oven that has opinions and a class that had signed up because word had gotten around that we were rude about fondant. There were four aunties at the bench with the competence of women who have fed boats and funerals, and a boy with a breathless look who wanted to fold pain into pastry and didn\u2019t say that aloud. We made a pie that didn\u2019t leak and a biscuit that did, and we decided the tidy thing was not always the goal. An old man came to the door with a cardboard tray of oranges from a tree that had forgiven him, and he put it down and said, \u201cFor the girls,\u201d and I didn\u2019t correct him. After, I sat on the steps out back with Renee and told her about my mother like I was describing weather. She put her hand on the back of my neck and squeezed once like a mechanic testing a bolt. She said, \u201cIf she comes, let her sit. You know how. If she goes, let her go. You know how,\u201d and then she told me about a woman named Tia who had taken a bus to Gisborne and met a man at a fish and chip shop and decided, over battered tarakihi, to stay one more day, and the next, and then two decades later to come home and teach a class on how not to waste your life pretending fat is a sin.\n\nThat week, the woman with the shaved head came back for more tartlets. This time she brought her mother, whose head still had hair, and they stood together in front of the table and told me that taste had returned like a memory out of order. They bought scones and then sat on the curb because the benches were full and ate in a silence that was not grim. When they left, the mother squeezed my fingers and told me I\u2019d done a kindness no doctor had managed, and I thought she overestimated me wildly and decided not to correct her because sugar can do better things when it\u2019s not interrupted.\n\nWe had a night in the hall where we tried to make kouign-amann because sometimes you need to look God in the eye. We drew butter into flour and the room smelled like a church for people who love a challenge. The first tray was a crime, and we ate it to hide the evidence. The second tray sang the right note, and the room made that small moan people do when dopamine knows it has a role. Jules leaned on the counter in the afterwards and said, \u201cDo we remember how to be small?\u201d and I said, \u201cWe are already small,\u201d and they said, \u201cNot like that,\u201d and I said, \u201cAsk me again when my mother sings to me or doesn\u2019t,\u201d and they nodded like I had told them the weather report for the kind of day that has both beach and windscreen wipers.\n\nThe day of the meeting I did not call a meeting, I put on a clean T-shirt and a jumper without sugar welded to it and wore my hair down because I wanted to look like a person who had made choices and not just been chosen by the kitchen. We met at a laundromat because the caf\u00e9 felt like too much and the park felt like a trick. The washing machines made their fluent arguments, and the smell of detergent did its best to tidy what it could. She came in with a plastic bag of clothes she didn\u2019t put down. She looked better than the first time, which is to say she looked like she had slept a little and had not argued with the mirror. We put coins in machines and watched fabric try to forgive sins. She asked me if I wanted to know the names of men who had tried to be father enough for a day. I said no because I couldn\u2019t keep them and she nodded like I\u2019d passed a test she hadn\u2019t meant to set. She told me about a job she had for a few months where she washed sheets in a hotel and the way she learned not to imagine the lives that had happened in them because she would drown. I told her about the hospice without saying the word dying and she understood without needing me to be brave.\n\nWhen the spin cycle hit that part where it feels like the world is going to leave the bench, she said, \u201cI am not good,\u201d and I said, \u201cNeither am I,\u201d and then we both corrected ourselves, because \u201cgood\u201d is a word that has been used against us for too long. She said, \u201cI am trying,\u201d and I said, \u201cMe too,\u201d which felt like giving each other a handshake in a dark room. When we parted, she touched my arm the way you touch a cat you don\u2019t know yet, light, and asked if I would send a photo of my stall because she wanted to see the sign. I sent it on the way home. She replied with a picture of a plate with three scones on it that were not mine and a caption that just said, Second try, and I sat in the car with the engine off and cried for four minutes with the clean grief of someone who has been waiting for a sentence exactly that length.\n\nPaperwork began to wear me out in new ways. The grant for the classes needed four references and a budget that made sense even in daylight. Poppy wrote one like a person used to being generous with stationery. The nurse from the hall wrote one that made me blush in the kitchen when I read it alone. Tasi wrote one that spoke about me as if I were an engine that could be tuned and he was profoundly impressed by the torque. The fourth came from the school in \u014ctara and it said, without weeping, that the scones had been soft and so had the way I had spoken to the kids and that these are related, which is the sort of sentence that should be allowed to be stapled to your person as a charm. I sent the packet off with a breath and a joke in the subject line because sometimes you can bribe the universe with tone.\n\nA woman named Lani came to the stall and asked if she could bring her Twins\u2014capital T\u2014to a class. She said it with the delicate smile of someone who has fielded too many jokes about twins and is not here for your comedy. The boys turned up with haircuts that had been negotiated and the carefulness of kids who have been told they are a handful and have decided to become one. We set them up at the end of the bench and I gave them the job of zesting lemons because it involves knives and adults are cowards. They zested with the concentration of surgeons and the kindness of people who split the good part of a biscuit without being asked. On the way out, one of them put fifty cents in the jar and the other took a fifty-cent piece out. Lani pretended not to see and then asked me on the phone later if that was stealing and I said it was balance and she said she had been raised strict and I said to raise them kind.\n\nSila got a call about her sister\u2019s baby and left a trail of tea towels and promises. She came back with photos that made us all fall over with the right kind of envy. We sent a box of scones and a jar of curd to a hospital ward where a new life had entered a room that smelled like sanitizer and sweat and someone swearing love through their teeth. In the group chat for the hall classes, a woman sent a picture of her first pie that didn\u2019t slump, and we all told her she was a god. The boy with the skateboard turned up with his mother, who bought a tart as if rewarding him for not getting detention, and then told me quietly she had been learning to bake from YouTube because sometimes talking to a person was too much, and I told her to come to class and stand at the back and leave if it was loud and she said she had been hoping I would tell her that.\n\nOn the day the grant email arrived, I was in the car outside the wholesaler calculating the per-scone cost of cream like I was being paid to do math. The subject line had the name of the council and then the word Congratulations, which should come with a medical warning. I read it twice and then out loud to the steering wheel, and then I sent a message to Renee which was only exclamation points and a lemon, and she replied with a photo of her hands and the elbow scar and a loaf of bread she had decided to teach the girls on Saturday because now we could afford more flour. I drove home with butter in the boot and hope on the passenger seat and got a parking ticket I refused to hate because sometimes you have to let the city take a coin out of your pocket and call it a tax for being alive.\n\nThat night, the community centre hall filled with people who had smelled something happen. We put a sign on the door that said FREE BISCUITS, FUNDING JOY, and the room did the thing where it grows another wall to make room. The knitting ladies came with their elbows and their opinions. The school teacher brought the boy who had accused me of treason against jam. The aunties from Whakat\u0101ne arrived with a plastic container of fried bread like a bribe. The beekeeper turned up with a jar labelled most polite this season. The health inspector came in civvies and refused to talk about hygiene more than once and then ate a lamington like she had been practicing not to for a month. Jules stood by the urn and poured tea with a flourish that made people put money in the jar even though it was a free biscuits night.\n\nI told them the grant had come through and that we could pay the hall without me having to decide whether butter or electricity mattered more. I told them we were going to run a class on Tuesdays for anyone who had ever been told off for making crumbs, and that the rule would be that if one person came we would teach one person and if thirty came we would teach thirty and if no one came we would sit in the kitchen and make biscuits for the Thursday drop-offs. People clapped and then began to mill around like molecules learning a new structure. Mrs. Kline sat in a chair near the door so she could direct traffic, Beethoven in his harness like a prisoner who had charmed his guard. Bo came in late with the kind of entrance you make when you know the room will make a space for you and told me she had written down the name of a woman who might tell me something I hadn\u2019t asked the right question for. I took the paper and put it between my fingers the way you do with a wafer at a church you attend sometimes.\n\nWhen the night was ebbing and the dishes were piled in a way that would make tomorrow yell my name, I went outside to the back steps, where the air knows you. The city had chosen to be quiet, which happens so rarely you should sit when it does. The gull on the fencepost had three feathers out of order and did not care. I thought about the tiny seam between acts of love and acts of labour. I thought about my mother\u2019s second-try scones and the way I had not yet decided if I would bring her a jar of curd or make her ask. I thought about Mrs. Healy and the way Coco\u2019s voice had held me in the doorway of that room, and about the way the hospice had loaned us a projector like it was the most normal thing. I thought about the boy with the exact change and the girl with the bitten nails and the twins who didn\u2019t steal, they balanced, and about how every room I had stood in had taught me to count chairs until I could stop.\n\nInside, someone yelled my name in a tone that meant there was either an emergency or a cake that had turned out prettier than expected. I stood up, felt a pull in the back of my calf that told me I was human and not built entirely from stubbornness, and went in. The next morning there would be a meeting with a woman at a bank who would speak to me like I was a ship in shallow water and offer me a loan with teeth. There would be a letter to write to a boy in Dunedin who wanted to know how to bake without waking his father. There would be a shopping list for butter and lemons and the green cord that goes on the gazebo that always disappears, and a call to Tasi to ask if the new sound Cherry was making was a joke or a threat. There would be all the small practical magic that keeps a life from coming apart at its seams. For now, the room put its hand on my back and moved me where I needed to be. For now, the biscuits cooled. For now, the gull shrieked two notes that didn\u2019t sound like my name and I decided I didn\u2019t mind.",

                              "content": "The morning the gulls learned my name, the Auckland sky was the colour of cold butter, and my kitchen window had the kind of condensation that makes everything beyond it blur into a kinder world. Steam curled from the pot where passionfruit pulp simmered and popped; a yellow riot turning itself into curd while the radio whispered news about delays on the motorway and a ferry that had left without someone important on it. I hummed a few bars of something I didn\u2019t know, tapping my spoon against the lip of the saucepan\u2014one, two, three\u2014and then checked the temperature again as if I could will it into place by staring.\n\nThe stove ran slightly hot, a fact that mattered to me more than it should. The curd thickened like it had been waiting for my attention all along, so I drew the pot off the heat and whisked in the butter. It was a slow bright spell of stirring, the kind that holds my head above water. I had a feeling the gulls across the street could smell sugar when the day was still deciding itself. They shrieked and flapped past the lamppost where flyers curled damply, where kids had taped an ad for a missing skateboard and a flatmate who didn\u2019t mind cats.\n\nMy flatmate, Kahu, padded in barefoot, hair springing into the sort of halo that defies gravity and fashion. He stretched, yawned, then flinched theatrically as the smell hit him.\n\n\u201cDamn, Nia, that\u2019s criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to anger the weather gods with something that good this early.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them come,\u201d I said, and tried not to grin. \u201cWant some on toast?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t. I absolutely should.\u201d He held out a plate, and I swiped a spoonful of curd onto the heel of a slice. He bit it, eyes rolling back. \u201cKiller. Sweet as. What\u2019s the occasion? Don\u2019t tell me\u2014just a Wednesday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Tuesday,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, there it is. The twinkle.\u201d He leaned against the benchtop, cocked a hip. \u201cIs this plan called \u2018inventing breakfast\u2019 or \u2018beating a bunch of very nice television people with your whisk\u2019?\u201d\n\nHeat crept up my neck. I liked that my friends were merciless; I liked it more than anything, in secret. \u201cBoth. Neither,\u201d I said. \u201cMrs. Healy is coming down from the hospice this afternoon. She claims to be bringing coconut.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour hospice gang is more exciting than my thesis committee.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s more exciting than your thesis committee.\u201d I scraped the last of the curd into a jar and pressed clingfilm onto its skin. Across the street, the gulls played something that sounded like laughter. \u201cDid your car start this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now,\u201d he said, wincing. \u201cShe coughed like a chain-smoker but she got there. I\u2019m taking her to Tasi this week. He\u2019ll yell at her and she\u2019ll straighten herself out, like me after my mother rings.\u201d\n\n\u201cTasi is a miracle worker,\u201d I said. \u201cCherry could use a stern talking-to as well.\u201d\n\nCherry was not so much a car as a stubborn red blister on wheels, a 2002 Mazda with a cracked dashboard and a temper. The back left window didn\u2019t roll down anymore, the radio sometimes sang only in static, and the passenger door required you to push it with both hands to close. But she had been mine since the summer I turned nineteen and scraped together enough from coffee shop tips and selling muffins at the markets, so maybe she lived on out of pure loyalty.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking Cherry to Tasi, too?\u201d Kahu asked. \u201cWhen\u2019s your next shoot? You told me yesterday and I forget. My brain is oatmeal.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo shoots,\u201d I said, though my voice didn\u2019t sound like mine for half a breath. \u201cThere\u2019s no next. I mean\u2014there is. But not like that. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWaiting,\u201d he repeated, drawing the word into something silly and significant. \u201cFor a call.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor an email,\u201d I said. \u201cThey always email before they call.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd do you have your phone volume up? Because if it\u2019s not loud enough, the email fairies can\u2019t get through.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have that lucky spoon you said you would never ever wash again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWashed it last night,\u201d I admitted. \u201cAccidents happen.\u201d\n\nHe put a hand to his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re a braver woman than I. Okay, I\u2019m off to prostrate myself in front of the gods of grading. Kai later?\u201d\n\n\u201cLater,\u201d I said, and listened to him throw a hoodie over his head, trip on the mat at the door, bark a laugh at himself, and gone. The apartment exhaled with him. The curd cooled. The radio man said something about a painter whose works were found in a thrift store for three dollars. The day began again.\n\nWhen my phone chimed\u2014just an email, just a ping\u2014the spoon in my hand knocked the counter. It was ridiculous, the freefall in my chest, the way the world narrowed to a crackling rectangle of glass. The sender line said what I knew it would: Production. The subject line was as simple as a heartbeat.\n\nWe would love to see you in the final, if you\u2019re willing.\n\nI had not known how much I was braced for a different sentence until then. I read it once, twice, a dozen times; I read it out loud to the kettle, to the sticky ring of sugar on the stovetop. The little black letters did not rearrange themselves into anything else. They were themselves, which meant I was a person standing in a crumby kitchen in Mount Roskill who had just been asked to step inside a white tent where flour behaved like confetti and somebody\u2019s grandmother was watching me through a television screen, thinking, Girl, try the lemon zest.\n\nI pressed my palms flat on the counter as if I could steady the world by pinning it down. My phone chimed again: a follow-up with the schedule, the list of requirements, the little hiragana of what lenses we were on and what we were to bring. And there, at the end, as casual as you like: Please drive to the location by 6:45 a.m. sharp. Directions attached.\n\nI laughed, the kind that noses against a sob. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me,\u201d I told the email. \u201cYou can and you did.\u201d\n\nI should have called Kahu back but picked Lena instead. She was at the caf\u00e9 in Eden Terrace by seven most days; we\u2019d worked together for years and held each other up through long shifts, through the summer a pipe burst and turned our backroom into a swamp, through my first episode where my hands shook so hard I thought the camera would catch me out. She answered on the second ring.\n\n\u201cNia. I was about to burn a batch of banana bread for you. You stopped me in the nick of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always put too much cinnamon in it,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s slander. You love my cinnamon. What\u2019s wrong? Your voice is strange.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey emailed,\u201d I said, and the smile split my face. \u201cThey want me in the final.\u201d\n\nThere was a noise in my ear that could have been Lena squealing or the coffee machine pitching a fit. \u201cYou\u2014what\u2014holy\u2014Nia. Oh my god. I knew it. I knew it. Of course. You\u2019re gonna be on the telly again, in the last one? The big one? Do you need me to come over there and fan you with a baking sheet?\u201d\n\n\u201cGas oven tray,\u201d I said, breathless. \u201cKahu says it has more surface area.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to Kahu, he\u2019s wise. I\u2019m making a chocolate roulade right this second and it\u2019s going to dance for you. And you\u2019re going to make\u2014what are you going to make? You can\u2019t tell me, can you. Because they\u2019ll sue you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell you some. They want a showstopper that tells a story,\u201d I said softly, like speaking it could shatter it. \u201cAnd a technical where we all cry. And a signature where I\u2019ll probably cut myself and pretend like I meant to. Or burn the sugar into a new element.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always say that and then you pull something out of yourself like it\u2019s been there since you were small.\u201d\n\nI was small once, smaller than I like to admit. In those days, before I knew proper ovens or the name for a soft peak or the patience to wait for butter to soften on its own, I baked in microwaves, in toaster ovens, in a cracked communal oven that devoured cookies and spit out grit with a grin. The home in Avondale had six of us then: two girls who braided my hair too tight, a boy who spoke only in hotspots of silence, a couple who loved each other in a way that made the whole house tilt. Renee was the house manager, a woman with hands that never stopped moving. She baked the way my mother might have\u2014I never knew; I don\u2019t guess out loud\u2014but there were scones that made everything warmer than it had been before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make something for her,\u201d I said now, into Lena\u2019s ear and also into the bigger listening space my life had become. \u201cFor Renee. For me. There\u2019ll be feijoa. Everyone will hate it except me.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone loves feijoa, shut up. I\u2019ll start stockpiling fruit. Hey. Proud of you. Proper proud. I\u2019d hug you but that would involve leaving the machine and then the world might stop, so I\u2019ll hold it for later.\u201d\n\nThe world did not stop. It changed angles. I poured coffee into the chipped mug with the fading picture of the Sky Tower, the one I\u2019d rescued from a box at the community centre because it felt like a talisman against the bigness of the city and the ache of being alone in it. I set the mug next to the jar of curd and, like a madwoman, opened the email again. They were filming the final in a vineyard outside Matakana. I knew the place; we\u2019d driven past on a school trip once, the vines held in neat tight rows like someone who had smoothed a hand over the earth. It would mean taking the motorway north, past Onewa Road where the trees showed their roots after a storm, the bridge arching like it was used to carrying much heavier stories than me. I tried to picture Cherry making it, her laugh of an engine keeping up. I could do it. I had done much harder things. Right?\n\nRight, I told myself, and the word had a wobble.\n\nBy midday I had told the people who would either show up with flowers or with the right kind of silence. Kahu blew me a kiss from the doorframe; Lena sent a picture of herself holding a piping bag like a dagger. Mrs. Healy messaged a long row of heart emojis that looked like a flock of odd birds. I made lunch I could not taste and, later, went to the hospice with two boxes: one for the staff, one for the women who helped me understand grief as a kind of second language. The hospice smelled like lemon hand gel and hope. The windows framed an ordinary blue day that seemed aware of itself, and the kitchen was blessedly empty save for the low hum of an overfed fridge.\n\n\u201cHallo, sweetheart,\u201d said Mrs. Healy, coming in with her stick thumping politely. She was tall and sharp and would not have looked out of place warning sailors about rocks. \u201cYou\u2019ve brought sun.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust curd,\u201d I said, and set the jar on the counter like an offering. \u201cAnd some little shortbreads. How are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cFull of mischief and pills,\u201d she said. \u201cI went hard at physiotherapy and now I can raise my arm like this.\u201d She lifted it to shoulder height and winced with triumph. \u201cTonight I will reach a little higher. And you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey asked me to be in the final,\u201d I said. The words had begun to fit my mouth.\n\nShe peered at me over the top of her glasses. \u201cMy pretty girl,\u201d she said, satisfied. \u201cOf course they did.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Healy\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, I know, looks aren\u2019t everything, but a pretty girl is a girl who is loved. And you are that now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t always.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you are now is what you are,\u201d she said, in a voice that belonged to both our mothers. She reached out and pinched my cheek, very lightly. \u201cYou are going to make those judges weep. Are you bringing your notebook? Are you bringing a plan? Are you going to remember to eat? Don\u2019t get thin on me. You always try to get thin when you get nervous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never try,\u201d I said. \u201cIt happens by accident. But I brought two sandwiches today.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmart,\u201d she said, clearly pleased. Then softer: \u201cI won\u2019t see it, you know. You\u2019ll have to tell me. When they announce it, when you stand there, give me the story. You\u2019re my eyes.\u201d\n\nI swallowed. We didn\u2019t say the rest aloud. Coco, the nurse with lavender on her wrists, drifted in and leaned against the counter, eyes bright.\n\n\u201cIs it true? Did you make it?\u201d she asked me. \u201cLily said she saw you in the paper last week and they were calling you \u2018our Auckland hopeful\u2019. I told her, Nah, she\u2019s our hopeful.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I made it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGirl, you\u2019re going to be world famous in Ponsonby,\u201d Coco said. \u201cPut me down for a pack of your biscotti now. When you get your own bakery and you forget the rest of us, I\u2019m going to show up with this spoon and bang on the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a key,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd your own seat.\u201d\n\nIt was a good afternoon. The ladies of the Tuesday knitting group tasted the curd with the reverence given to manna and then critiqued it with the ferocity given to injustice. Too sharp, said Nora; not sharp enough, said Lily; just right, said Mrs. Healy, because she knew when to back me and when to push. I brought out a second jar and a third, things I had not planned to make but somehow had on hand because that\u2019s the sort of person I am when I\u2019m afraid. We talked recipes and pronkt with the yarn, all of it, and when I walked back into the slightly cooler evening, my heart had found a place to stand where it didn\u2019t shake.\n\nOn the way home, Cherry rattled like someone with a secret. At the lights on Dominion Road, she coughed once, then twice, like a warning. I patted the steering wheel and talked to her like a horse. \u201cNot yet,\u201d I said. \u201cWait for me. I\u2019m almost there.\u201d\n\nThe email had attached directions to the vineyard; I printed them at the library, because paper settles me, because the act of folding it twice and tucking it beneath a magnet on my fridge made the world real. I put asterisks next to the lines about showstopper notes and labelled plastic containers. I wrote a list on the back:\n\n- candied feijoa peel\n- puff pastry test batch #3\n- new piping nozzles, maybe the leaf one?\n- call Tasi for cherry\n\nI wrote cherry, lowercase, like a fruit. Then I crossed it out and wrote Cherry, like a promise.\n\nI practiced. I practiced until the apartment smelled like sugar, burned and redeemed, until the floor was a white map of mistakes, until my fingers were blistered from the whisk and I was talking to myself, which is to say, I was talking to Renee. She used to say, \u201cIt\u2019s all in the wrist, baby,\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t you dare throw that batch away\u2014there are no saints who aren\u2019t sinners first,\u201d and I could hear her voice now\u2014smoke(d) and honey\u2014holding up the edges of me. I made a rough sketch of a croquembouche disguised as a pohutukawa tree, then threw the sketch away on account of madness. I test-drove a lamington sponge so light it forgave me for everything I\u2019d done to it. I folded feijoa into cream and sugar and the memory of summer. When the curd ran away from me, I coaxed it back. When the caramel seized, I ignored the camera in my head and swore, quietly, then louder, then with relief.\n\nOn the third day, with my kitchen turned into a full armed conflict between flour and sanity, Kahu stuck his head around the door, blinked, and said, \u201cEver thought of opening an industrial bakery and moving your bed in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an option,\u201d I said, hair anchored with a tea towel. \u201cI\u2019m making four things at once. It\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a lie or a sacred chant.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and then, because he looked at me gently, I let the secret out. \u201cSometimes I think, if I win, it changes everything. And if I don\u2019t, it changes nothing. And both of those are frightening.\u201d\n\nKahu came in, stepping around a saucepan like it was a small animal with teeth. \u201cTell me your other fear, the one you\u2019re not saying,\u201d he said.\n\nI ran water over my fingers, watched the sugar dissolve. \u201cDriving,\u201d I said. \u201cOn the day. It\u2019ll be early. There\u2019s the bridge, and the motorway, and the thought keeps gnawing. What if Cherry decides to throw a fit. What if I\u2019m late and they throw me out and that\u2019s the story I tell for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be early,\u201d he said, like it was a blessing. \u201cWe\u2019ll take Cherry to Tasi on Friday. He\u2019ll do the thing with the screwdriver and the swearing, and she\u2019ll purr. Don\u2019t look at me like that. Trust him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cI just\u2014money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little. You\u2019ve got a lot of cake. We\u2019ll start a black market in shortbread. Also, I know your secret fans. They\u2019ll pay whatever you tell them to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have fans,\u201d I said, and we laughed until it was true.\n\nLater, alone, I stood at the sink with the window open to the evening and watched a bus hum past, yellow seats bobbing with passengers. A couple on the sidewalk argued softly but kept their hands stitched together by a finger. The sky went belly-up salmon pink. I had the impulse to call Jules, which scared me because of what it meant. Jules had been in the tent with me once, early, the episode where we made things that melted if you looked at them sideways. They were from Christchurch, they wore bracelets their little sister had made, and they had a way of swearing with tenderness that settled me down. We had not been allowed to be friends in the way that lasts; rules and timing stole that from us. But after the episode aired, we\u2019d called anyway. And then sometimes, when the weight lay across my chest like a cat refusing to move, I\u2019d call and they\u2019d pick up and talk about nothing until it shifted.\n\nI pressed their name with my thumb; when they answered, their voice landed in my ear like a hand on my arm.\n\n\u201cHey, baker,\u201d Jules said. \u201cHow\u2019s the world of butter and tears?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey asked me to the final,\u201d I said. It still felt like a dare when I said it.\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re obscene,\u201d Jules said, without missing a beat. \u201cI mean that in a nice way. Congratulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I shifted the phone to the other side. \u201cI\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll mess the lamingtons. How embarrassing would that be.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo embarrassing,\u201d they said solemnly. \u201cI mean, you\u2019d have to move to Australia. Witness protection. It\u2019s over for you.\u201d\n\nI snorted. \u201cWow, thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to make something that tastes like the first lemonade you ever drank in summer,\u201d Jules said, gentler. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be annoying about it. And then you\u2019re going to call me afterward, and we\u2019re going to debrief on who cried and what jokes the hosts made that didn\u2019t land. And if you don\u2019t win\u2014listen to me now\u2014if you don\u2019t, we\u2019re still going to do that. Okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou have your list?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich one? I\u2019ve got about seven.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one with the practical shit. Petrol, spare tyre, snacks, Spotify playlist labelled \u2018don\u2019t cry on the bridge\u2019.\u201d\n\nI looked at my fridge where a magnet held my paper life together. \u201cWorking on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWork faster,\u201d they said. \u201cYou can control that. The rest\u2014nope. That\u2019s for ghosts and editors. You\u2019re too alive for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you to be this kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a menace,\u201d they said. \u201cGo sleep. The secret is sleep.\u201d\n\nThe secret had always been sleep, and there had always been not enough of it. I dreamed of butter melting in my hands and woke to my pillow being too warm. I put on old sneakers and ran down to the dairy on the corner in the dim half-light, bought milk and eggs and bananas and let Mr. Singh tell me about the cricket as if the score mattered to the sugar in my veins. On the way back, my phone buzzed again with a text from Production with more instructions and a caution about the early start and a reminder to bring ID and a smile. The smile I could do. The ID I could find. The rest of it, I would hold like a bowl full to the lip, steadying each move.\n\nFriday came, and with it a sky like steel and the thin threat of rain. Kahu drove with me to Tasi\u2019s garage in Sandringham, the one with the painted mural of a sea turtle on the roller door and a bench made from old tyres. Fa\u2019amasino was his last name, Tasi what everyone called him because he was the first son and carried that with a grin that could turn a wrench. He had been fixing everyone\u2019s car since the nineties and was the only person I\u2019d ever seen talk a radiator into behaving.\n\n\u201cNi sa bula, sis,\u201d he said, when I rolled Cherry in. \u201cShe\u2019s still red? Good. Red cars never quit, they just sulk.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a little cough,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s... I\u2019ve got to drive to Matakana.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me and then at the car and then at me again, and his eyebrows did the exact thing that meant he wasn\u2019t going to make me feel bad about money. \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure she sings,\u201d he said. \u201cLeave her with me. You go get a pie. You look like a broom.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolite,\u201d I told him. \u201cThank you. Don\u2019t let her forget me.\u201d\n\nHe patted the bonnet. \u201cShe knows your hand. Go on.\u201d\n\nWe waited in the little office that smelled like oil and corrugated iron and coffee burned until it came good. There were magazines about boats and men in shorts, and a calendar with kittens in hard hats, and a sign that said No we do not fix computers. Kahu tapped a rhythm on the arm of the chair. I pretended to read worth less nothing of a brochure on windscreen replacements and watched the rain decide, then not decide, then fall.\n\nTasi came back out with a rag over his shoulder and a look that said he had found something and he wasn\u2019t going to be alarmed about it. \u201cYour girl\u2019s got a worn belt and a battery keen to retire,\u201d he said. \u201cNeeds tender love and a little cash. How deep\u2019s your love?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do the belt,\u201d I said, before I could stop myself, because poor and proud are cousins. \u201cThe battery\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t bake on the side of the road,\u201d he said, not unkind. \u201cYou need both. Lucky for you, I like lamingtons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring you six dozen,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThree,\u201d he said, smug. \u201cAnd a loaf of whatever that bread is that smells like angels.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrioche,\u201d Kahu supplied. \u201cShe makes the price of property rise when she bakes it.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsider it done,\u201d I said.\n\nWe bartered until I felt stupid and then steady again. Tasi called me girl twice and sister once; it is the kind of love I can stand. I left Cherry there with a kiss to the steering wheel and walked home in the drizzle with Kahu\u2019s umbrella handle hooked over my wrist. The day had a chill through it; the air smelled like rain on tarmac and damp jacaranda. My shoes squelched. A gull escorted us for a block and then gave up.\n\nThe apartment was a set of lists. I lay them out on the table and picked them up, one by one, like cards in a game where the stakes were not my life and also were. I placed bowls where I would want them, as if I could practice the final from a distance, as if my hands could learn without the heat or the eyes on them. The truth is, the tent had felt like home. I had flour on my lips and butter in my hair and a silly smile I couldn\u2019t not wear, and the producers had moved like careful moths around us, trying not to startle anything. I had learned the rhythm of the jokes and the tap of the judges\u2019 shoes. I had learned to breathe when the timer sounded like it was mocking me. I was ready\u2014except for the parts of me that never would be. Which is to say: the parts of me that had lived through late nights counting chairs in the community centre to make rent; the parts of me that had sat in the kitchens of houses that were not mine and learned to wipe counters so I could stay; the parts of me that, when I am honest, still flinch at sudden kindness as if from a blow.\n\nWhen I couldn\u2019t bake anymore, I went down to the water. It was what I do when my head buzzes, when the city feels like a jar with the lid screwed on too tight. At Devonport, the wind tried to jam itself into my ears, and the sea held the shore in its mouth, and people who weren\u2019t me walked past very alive. A couple took wedding photos and then looked like children who had been dressed up by their mothers. The ferry churned up a long ribbon of white that wrinkled the blue. I told the sea the same thing I always tell it: that I am small, that I am afraid of disappearing, that I am also, stubbornly, something like a woman made of eggs and sugar and heat.\n\nWhen I got home, there was a note under my door, in a spidery hand that nearly fell off the page with the effort of being read:\n\nMuffin girl\u2014don\u2019t make those fancy people forget where you came from. Make one thing that tastes like an afternoon on the back steps. And if you need a ride, say so. We don\u2019t have to be proud all the time. \u2014Mrs. Kline, 3B.\n\nMrs. Kline was ninety if she was a day and had a cat named Beethoven who hated everyone but me because once I fed him a little sliver of ham. She took the stairs one at a time and died in my nightmares, but for now she lived in a world where she crocheted covers for kettles and put her hand through my open window to leave me notes.\n\nI put the note on my fridge next to the directions. In case of literal disaster, she had written, in smaller letters. Phone me.\n\nCherry came back to me the following afternoon, purring like a cat after cream. I drove her around the block and then around the next one and then as far as Onehunga and back just to feel the motor stretch, line by line. I filled her tank. I vacuumed the crumbs under the driver\u2019s seat and found a bobby pin I\u2019d lost and two dollars. I put a little square of old towel on the dashboard so I could rest my phone there for the directions, like a ninety-year-old, like the child I was. On the morning before the final, I put my hands on Cherry\u2019s hood and said thank you, because I have learned to thank things I expect to hold me.\n\nThe last night before, I slept. Properly. The sort of sleep that arrives like a friend on a warm afternoon and insists you lie down on the couch with your feet tucked under and your eyes turned to a place where light leaks through your closed lids. Morning came cool and clean. I stood under the shower until the hot water sighed its last. I pulled on jeans and a T-shirt and a light jumper and tied my hair up and down three times and settled on up, because of cameras, because of the relentlessness of the wind at Matakana. I ate two slices of toast and half a banana and could not remember if either had tasted of anything. I checked my lists. I put the spare tyre on my list though it was already in the boot. I kissed the magnet that held the directions on my fridge and did a stupid little dance at the door because there was no one to see me and because my body needed to celebrate something, anything.\n\nThe city at five was not my city. It belonged to men in high-vis vests and women in quiet shoes walking dogs that glowed under the streetlights. The motorway sighed. The gulls were asleep. The radio played a song that promised me I was not alone and then forgot me immediately. I drove the way you do when you are not sure if you have permission; I touched my shoulder to check the seatbelt out of an old superstition; I whispered the names of exits like a prayer.\n\nA few minutes before six, my phone vibrated on the towel where it sat. I glanced down. Production had texted: See you soon! Coffee is hot. The tent is a dream. Drive safe.\n\nI put the phone face down. I breathed. I could do this. The bridge rose up ahead like a spine. The harbor unrolled itself like a sheet behind. I tightened my grip on the wheel until my knuckles had their own ideas, and I sang, badly, on purpose, the song my mother never sang me, the one that goes, You are your own home. I believed it. I tried to.\n\nThere were so many ways to tell this story. There was the version where I delivered on the promise of the girl in the paper. There was the version where I made small neat mistakes and smiled and no one noticed and the world kept turning and later we ate cake on the couch and laughed. There was the version where I didn\u2019t make it at all. There were so many roads.\n\nI took the one that was in front of me. I breathed in between each exit, in between each flicker of taillight, in between the billboards that told me to be a better person and buy a better vacuum and remember my insurance renewal. The sky was pink again, but this time there was a bruise of cloud in the west, and I tried to convince my heart it wasn\u2019t an omen, just water where the light hadn\u2019t got yet. On Onewa, the trees held their roots quiet under the earth; on Constellation, a bus hissed like it had relieved itself; on Oteha, a sign told me to slow down for some reason or other and I did.\n\nWhen the motorway opened out into the stretch that takes you north of the city, where the hills roll like lazy seals and the sea can\u2019t quite make up its mind to come closer, Cherry hummed a steady rhyme. I patted the dashboard once, twice, three times\u2014one for luck, one for old times, one for Mrs. Healy. The sun came up clean. For a breath, I forgot my mouth was dry.\n\nYou\u2019d think, if the world were kind or at least consistent, that would be the end of it, the simple little start of a morning that would file itself under Nice Days. You\u2019d think the yellow cone of light on the road was some sort of blessing, and the radio talking about bees was a sign that sweetness had a plan. In another telling, maybe it was. In the one that happened, I breathed, I drove, I thought of dough and hands and heat and faces I loved, and I felt the very faintest stutter under my foot that could have been nothing and could have been the beginning of everything. I told myself not yet, not yet, not yet.\n\nI drove on. I drove as if the story remembered how to be kind. I drove into a day that had teeth and laughter both, and my hands on the wheel were steady enough to convince me that I belonged to myself, which is all any of us ever get. I drove toward the white tent, and to the place I had made for myself, and if I was also driving toward a crack in the road where the whole thing might catch\u2014well.\n\nWhoever said being an orphan means you don\u2019t have a family never ate cake on this island. We make our families out of sugar and salt and the messy way we show up at each other\u2019s doors. That morning, with the sun lifting and the road obliging and my heart behaving for once, I believed it with a ferocity that warmed my skin. I believed in flour as an instruction manual for resurrection. I believed in the church of kitchens and the prayer of a well-timed timer. I believed in my hands.\n\nAnd before the day was over, I would need all of that belief, the whole basket of it, stacked high and leaning, wobbling but refusing to fall. For now, the curd sat in its jars. For now, the women at the hospice slept or didn\u2019t. For now, the city shrugged on its jacket. For now\u2014still\u2014there was this bright line of road. I took it, and the gulls, if they watched me from their lamppost councils, squawked like my name was made of sugar and salt and something hard as bone.",

Dawn did that shy trick where it pretends not to have been planning this all night, and the dark let go of the edges of the hills in stages. Trucks moved like deliberate animals, their taillights blinking a language I had almost learned. I had been a passenger most of my childhood, and then for a long time a walker, and then briefly the kind of girl who thought buses were a kind of moving church because they delivered you somewhere that was not where you started. When I finally learned to drive, it was in a parking lot behind a decommissioned video store, with a volunteer named Mike who smelled like peppermint and had one good joke about parallel parking he refused to ruin by explaining. He taught me to breathe through the merges, to look where I wanted to go instead of where I was afraid I might end up, to trust my hands the way I trusted a whisk. I remembered him now when the lane split at Oteha and I chose the right-hand fork, the one that would take me to a day I had imagined like a cathedral.\n\nCherry\u2019s little stutter returned once, then thought better of becoming an incident, and flattened out into a hum that steadied me more than the coffee I had only half-finished. The new stretch of motorway rippled under us, and I could feel where the tar had been hot enough to smell new last summer. A sign with cheerful green letters pointed toward P\u016bhoi, and then Warkworth, and the smaller white sign beneath it whispered Matakana in letters that felt familiar enough to be a promise. The radio told me about bees and then about a finance minister I had no feelings left for, and then\u2014it could have been coincidence\u2014played a song my mother never played, a lullaby disguised as pop, and I let myself sing long low notes on the vowels because sometimes that is the only way to loosen the thread that strangles you.\n\nI stopped once, at a service station that had lived the same life in a hundred towns. I parked under a lamp that blinked like it was bored of its own job and went in to buy water and the kind of barley sugar my grandmother in my head would approve of. The girl at the till had green eyeliner like a deliberate mistake and a badge that said SERA even though she looked like a Sarah who didn\u2019t want to be. She smiled like she had been taught to and then like she meant it when she saw the nervous way I was tapping my fingers against my thighs. There was a rack of pamphlets about wine tours and a poster for a raffle to support a local rugby team, and someone had taped a sign under the EFTPOS machine that said You\u2019re doing great, sweetie. I believed them all for a minute and then pushed the feeling into my pocket with my change. When I came back out, the wind had done something interesting with my hair, and the gull on the roof of the building next door tilted its head at me like we were in on the same long-running joke.\n\nThe turn-off to Matakana arrived like a friend pretending to be casual about an important meeting. The road narrowed and then sighed, and the scenery made up its mind to be vineyards and orchards and hills that rolled themselves into the horizon and fell asleep. I drove past a sign for a farmers\u2019 market I\u2019d visited once when my life was more about the price of carrots than the price of flour, and then past a stand selling honey in jars that looked like spare suns, and then a child with a lemon stand that made my whole chest ache with a memory of wanting enough to make things for strangers. The vineyard was only half-hidden; you could see the neat rows of vines from the road like good handwriting, and between them the pale, stubborn gleam of a white tent that had become, for the last months, a symbol that could undo me. Production had overrun the gravel drive with a choreography of vans, cables, and determined people in headsets who all looked like they knew where they were going even when they didn\u2019t.\n\nSecurity waved me in with a clipboard and a smile that softened at the edges when I said my name. It is one of my secret pleasures to be expected in a place that is not a hospital. A woman with a lanyard that said Poppy in block letters and a pen tucked behind her ear materialized at my window and leaned down like a friendly crane. The smell of wet grass and coffee wove together around her.\n\n\u201cNia?\u201d she asked, even though my car was labeled and my face was on a sheet somewhere. \u201cKia ora. You made it. Park over there by the cones, please. Lovely. How are you feeling? Don\u2019t answer that, everyone\u2019s answer is \u2018weird\u2019. We\u2019ve got you checked in, temperature today\u2019s perfect for chocolate, and we hid the bees.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can hide bees,\u201d I said, because my mouth had to say something, and there was more of me in that question than I meant there to be.\n\n\u201cWe have a guy who whispers to them,\u201d she said, as deadpan as a judge. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet him in a minute. Come on. We\u2019ll get you mic\u2019ed up and in out of this breeze.\u201d\n\nIn a small, temporary building that had the audacity to pretend it was permanent, I was measured for my day in whispers. A woman with a belt full of tiny miracle machines clipped something to the back of my jeans and ran a wire up under my jumper so that the mic sat just at the hollow of my throat like a necklace that wasn\u2019t allowed to be pretty. I watched my hands while she worked and tried not to swallow because the cord tickled and I didn\u2019t want to be the person who choked on her own hype. In the mirror across the room, a person who looked like me stood in the light and smoothed her eyebrows and tried not to think about how many people would see the shine on her nose. I had dressed without a thought to cameras, except that I had, in a hundred small ways\u2014no stripes too small, no white that would ruin the exposure, the good apron in my bag as if an object could anchor me.\n\nPoppy handed me a laminated schedule that was both a map and a dare. The fonts were too cheerful for what they contained. Signature first, then a break that would be the length of three breaths, then the technical that would separate those of us who had sleep and steel from those of us who had grace, then interviews, then the long slow march to the showstopper that would either crown me or teach me something I would pretend to be grateful for later. She walked me out into the tent and the air lifted a little in my lungs like a relief. Nothing was a surprise and everything was. The long rows of benches were cleaner than any kitchen has a right to be, the equipment gleamed like we were in a catalogue for a life I couldn\u2019t afford, and the sides of the tent bellied in and out with the breeze as if the whole structure was breathing faster than it meant to. Outside, the vines waited like an audience with tans.\n\nMy bench was third from the left. Someone had written my name in thick, confident marker on a card taped to the counter, and beneath it someone else had corrected the spelling to include the macron and drawn a tiny smiley face next to the a. It undid me in a quiet, constructive way. I touched the card like it was a little banner, then set my box of ingredients where my hands would reach for them on instinct. The feijoas nestled in the tea towel I had wrapped them in; they smelled like my first summer that didn\u2019t hurt. My piping nozzles checked themselves against the list I had written with a stern voice in my head, and even though I had forgotten the leaf nozzle like a person sleepless about a small thing will always forget the exact small thing she was sleepless about, I felt the jolt of panic and then let it go. I could improvise leaves. I had been improvising leaves since I learned what green tasted like.\n\nArjun arrived at the bench to my right, wearing an apron that had the tidy, useful stains of someone who treated flour with a level of respect bordering on flirtation. He had once made a puff pastry that looked like it had read the manual first. He moved like a baker in his own kitchen even when the room was full of lenses, and it made me want to stand up straight. To my left, Maia set down a cooler bag with a thump that said she had brought enough butter to issue as rations. Her hair was braided into a plait that had survived a life of weather, and the moko kauae I had seen her get last month was healed now, elegant and sure. It was nice to be stood between a pair of people who understood something about food as a language, and something about stubbornness as a way to be polite to the world.\n\n\u201cMorning, team,\u201d Arjun said, in the muttered way we all said it, like a spell we shouldn't wake up.\n\n\u201cMorena,\u201d Maia said, and squeezed my shoulder once. \u201cYou sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a person who forgot,\u201d I said, and she grinned like the little lie had not fooled her. \u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a log on a boat,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is to say, I moved, but I stayed where I was.\u201d\n\nWe were shepherded to the front of the tent for a little about-to-happen that would later look like spontaneity. The hosts bounced in with a rush of cold air that made everyone smile because it let us know we were still here, and they did their jokes about us smelling good and being gluttons for punishment. They were kind, and that more than anything loosened my ribs. The judges were the other kind of kind, the kind that doesn\u2019t soften itself down for you because it trusts you enough to take the edges. One had fingers that could tell if a dough was lying; the other had eyes that could see if a cake had decided to be proud. They told us the brief and pretended we didn\u2019t know it already, and I felt the exact level change in the room when everyone found their rhythm inside the rules.\n\nThe Signature was what I had been afraid of and also what I had wanted: six lamingtons, elevated but true to their heart, almost identical in size and spirit, with a filling that could tame a stubborn judge. We had two hours, which is the kind of time that seems long until you watch it set itself on fire. I had made a list for this moment, and it was as good as a breath. Eggs, sugar, whip until they remember they were once a little bit sky; flour sifted like mercy; butter folded in like you\u2019re saying sorry and meaning it; bake, cool, don\u2019t cut corners, literally, because crumbs will betray you in the chocolate; curd at body temperature so it will spread like it lives there; coconut toasted because this is a tent and you need every layer of flavour to stand up and be counted when the cameras look at it. I had already decided against jam in a moment that had felt like treason at the time. Instead, I would use the feijoa curd and a line of lime-leaf sugar that had sat in a jar on my counter for a week, learning how to be itself.\n\nThey said go and the room changed colour. I beat eggs until they were pale enough to think of themselves as something else, and the sound of the whisk on metal was a rhythm I could set a life to. Pans into the oven, a flick of fingers I didn\u2019t label lucky but was, a glance at the oven thermometer because the numbers on the dial had lied to me before and would do it again if I let them. The tent breathed in and out and we breathed with it, and the camera crew moved around us like they were on a ski slope, all slick glides and unbothered balance. Arjun had his sponge in before I did and was melting chocolate with a seriousness he normally saved for his maths. Maia hummed, and the song was one my bones knew, and because of it I remembered to check the corners of my pan and loosen them with a knife so the sponge would not tear when I tipped it out.\n\nThe curd did the thing where it wants to be a sauce, then remembers that you love it, then thickens into the kind of pour that can be trusted. I tasted it the way my grandmother would have, with a finger I pretended not to stick in my mouth, and rolled the sharpness around like a coin. The feijoa had come through. The lime leaf sat like a complicated friend, interesting in the after. I cut squares and tried not to look mournful at the offcuts even though there is a part of me that wants to save everything. I slid them into the blast chiller like a thief returning treasure and stood still for a breath because stillness is an ingredient too.\n\nChocolate and coconut asked for the kind of attention I\u2019d long been bad at giving. I tempered by eye because my thermometer had a way of scolding me I didn\u2019t appreciate, and I trusted the way the chocolate felt under my spoon when it was ready to behave. I folded in a little cream to soften the snap because lamingtons are not meant to break a tooth, no matter how impressive the shine. The first dip will always tell you your future; mine went in, came out glossy, and caught its snow of coconut with a sigh that made me want to write a poem. That moment doesn\u2019t last, and I knew it, so I set myself to the repeatable actions, building a little assembly line as if I had invented industry. Knife, cut, curd, lid, dip, drip, roll, set, breathe. I kept thinking of Renee standing by the sink in the Avondale kitchen, her cigarette left unlit for ten minutes while she watched me whisk like my life depended on it, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t look at the bowl like it did you wrong. It\u2019s trying its best.\u201d\n\nWhen the hosts swung by, I found the version of myself that could talk without losing count of breaths. They wanted to know about the feijoa, if I was prepared to fight for it, if I knew half the country loved it and half thought it tasted like potpourri. I smiled like the old woman in me would have when the church ladies said her dress was too red. I said the fruit had raised me, that I was just doing right by it, that the coconut would act like a neighbour who softened the edges of a morning with a loaf delivered wearing a tea towel. They asked if I was worried about the time and I lied so sweetly I almost believed myself.\n\nAcross the bench, Arjun was doing a clever thing with pistachios and a cardamom syrup that made the tent smell like a holiday. His lamingtons were square in spirit even if the edges melted into the coconut like they wanted to join another shape, and he had a plan for how to crown them with a little shard of caramel that would look like light caught on the tongue. Maia stayed as true as a compass pointed to her own north. She cooked down wild blackberry jam she had foraged for last summer and carried back like contraband in jars wrapped in old socks. She wiped the edges of each square like a mother wiping a face, and then she did something I loved and would have feared: she rolled the coconut with kawakawa sugar, which let it look like sand that had grown up into a forest.\n\nThey laid a shot of the three of us like it was a school picture day where everyone turned up exactly who they were. Nobody said it aloud, but the air held the kind of quiet that meant we all understood what we were doing\u2014trying to speak our names out loud in a room that would always be bigger than us. When the judges came to taste, the tent found another, deeper stillness. The pastry queen cut into mine with a knife that looked like it had been sharpened by the sea, and her eyes did the thing they do when she has decided to be pleased. The other judge did that maddening, wonderful pause like he was writing the sentence in his head so he wouldn\u2019t say it wrong when it came out. They told me my sponge was tender, which in this context is not an insult but a knighthood, and that the feijoa had been handled with respect. One of them tilted their head and said perhaps the chocolate could have been a hair thinner, but then said a thing that folded me open, which was that my lamington tasted like a particular afternoon that could be named if you were brave. I didn\u2019t cry, but the part of me that likes corners more than the middle of rooms considered it.\n\nWe stood back and clapped for each other because this was not a war and we had learned what it would mean to make it one. Arjun got praise for balance and a nudge about his corners; Maia got a small lecture about the generosity of her jam and a compliment about courage. The hosts did a joke about coconut in their socks that did not land, and then another about rolling with it that did, and the tent exhaled as one organism. After they had what they wanted from our faces, we were released to the little corner where they had assembled snacks as if to remind us we were animals. I ate a handful of almonds like they had personally offended me and forced my mouth to drink water as if I were apologizing to it with each swallow.\n\nMy phone, which I had put face-down in the bag they allowed on the chair by the back of the tent, got to me anyway with its small insistence. In a moment between reality and its filming, I checked it, and there was a message the length of a breath from Coco at the hospice with a picture of Mrs. Healy\u2019s hand making a V that could have been victory or vigilance. Under it was a line that said, Eat, my girl, and remember you can always bake again tomorrow. The way my heart answered could not be called polite. It was a kind of shout that did not make a sound. I ate two more almonds, then a cube of cheese that had sweated itself into honesty, and then I let myself sit for a minute on the step at the back of the tent to look out at the vines and the sky that had already worked through three moods this morning.\n\nFor the technical, they took away the scaffolding we\u2019d built around ourselves. The brief was a sheet of paper with instructions designed to look helpful and actually teach you about your beliefs about God. We were told we would be making a mille-feuille, which is French for \u201ca thousand chances to fail\u201d and also for \u201cif you get the lamination right, you will feel a private joy you can\u2019t tell anyone about without sounding smug.\u201d There was going to be pastry cream, which seems easy until it decides to be scrambled eggs; there would be puff pastry from scratch, which would demand everything we had and then ask for a little more; there would be cutting, which is like translation\u2014you could have all the right words and still say something wrong if your knife wandered. We had two hours and forty-five minutes and the kind of cameras that can see through walls.\n\nI looked down at the butter and flour and water that were meant to become layers you could count and then not count. The tent had changed its breathing. People talk about miracles like they are big and obvious, but in kitchens they are small and absolute. Butter at the exact point it can be coerced without broken pride is one. The right amount of water to bring flour together without riling up the gluten is another. The way a bench can hold the cold until your hands learn it is the kind of quiet you only get when you\u2019ve made a friend of a surface. I measured with my eyes and then with the scale because I have learned that my eyes are romantic and the scale is stern. I kept my movements clean and sure, the way Mike had taught me to signal and merge, and I pressed the butter into a rectangle that asked not to be judged too early.\n\nWe folded like prayer. Single fold, chill, double fold, turn, chill, the kind of repetition that either bores you or saves you. Arjun muttered numbers under his breath and I watched the way his hands have become less precise and more sure over the past months; Maia sang something under hers and you could hear the paper of it, the way the sound laid itself down in sheets. Between folds, I cooked pastry cream with a whisk that has to be called faithful. Someone\u2019s cream split in the other row and a gentle panic rose like steam and then fell, because the judge leaned in and said two words\u2014cold bowl\u2014and the cream came back to itself like a girl deciding to try again.\n\nThe tent did a thing then that I love. It felt like a room where the rules were strict and the people were not cruel. You could feel us wanting each other to succeed because there is nothing interesting about being the best if the people next to you are ruined. I moved my dough to the oven and asked the universe to be reasonable about heat. This particular oven has a personality that can\u2019t be fixed; it thinks it is funny to be bright on the left and shy on the right, and if you do not know how to turn your tray at exactly the right moment, you will cry into a tea towel later. I did my turn, not because of anything I could prove but because my body had learned the timing. When the butter released little breaths, I let myself look pleased for exactly the length of a heartbeat.\n\nThere is a point in the technical where no one breathes properly. It\u2019s the cutting. I found the sharpest knife they had provided us, which is to say a knife sharp enough for chopping onions but not for slicing something that demands clean geometry. I heated the blade in hot water and wiped it dry and made a first cut that decided the other cuts. It was almost okay. It was okay enough that a person who loved me would see what I wanted and forgive what I couldn\u2019t make obey me. I stacked cream between pastry with the kind of care reserved for handling a baby or a bomb, and I dusted the top with sugar the way you finish a sentence you hope will land. When the judges came by, I felt the old schoolchild in me want to explain my mistakes before I was asked. I didn\u2019t. I let the sugar speak until it was time for me to say what I meant, which is that this was a technical but also a confession.\n\nMaia\u2019s layers were poems stacked on each other. Arjun\u2019s were a single sonnet that thought it was ten. Mine were tidy enough for a woman who has had to be tidy to live. The comments were the kind that see you from two angles and still hold you in the middle. I got a nod about lamination and a raised eyebrow about a pastry cream that had wanted to go grainy in its hour of pride; I took the criticism like a spoon and stirred it into the stew of myself for later. When we were released for ten minutes that felt like ten seconds, I walked back behind the tent to where the grape leaves stood like a thousand green tongues, and I let myself picture the showstopper without getting too cocky about it.\n\nThe sketch in my head for the final bake had gone through several evolutions, many of them crimes. It had wanted to be a croquembouche disguised as a p\u014dhutukawa tree, and then a lamington tower that would inevitably fall like a politician, and then a sensible tart that tasted like home without trying to be clever. In the end, I had found a shape that felt like a handshake with myself. I would make a reef of little cakes and crisp things and gooey things, a low, wide celebration instead of a height contest. There would be feijoa sabl\u00e9 cookies pressed with a floral pattern my body remembered from a plate at a house I left when I was ten. There would be tiny brul\u00e9e\u2019d tartlets filled with a curd that married lemon and feijoa without making a sound about it. There would be fingers of sponge dipped in a chocolate that didn\u2019t bite, a little ripple of meringue that had behaved itself under a torch, shards of sugar spun thinner than my patience and stuck in place like a vow. It would build outwards like an afternoon on the back steps, the way Mrs. Kline had told me to, and I would not apologize for any of it.\n\nBefore they called us back, Poppy came to stand next to me like a person who remembers the exact shape of your bubble. She checked my mic with a practiced flick, then asked if I needed water or a joke or a different life. I asked for the joke, and she told me one about a croissant walking into a bar and being told to leave because the bar was gluten-free, which did not make me laugh until it did. She adjusted the wire at the back of my neck like she was gentling an animal, then let me have one of the small private moments no one tells you are the thread that hold these days together. I put my hand in my pocket to touch the note Mrs. Kline had slipped under my door, and the paper crackled like a dare. There was a smear of butter on it now so faint you\u2019d miss it, and I wondered if everything I loved would eventually carry that mark.\n\nWe were called to places and the room narrowed back down to the exact size of my bench. The hosts said something lively that would later be intercut with music that made us sound braver than we were, and the judges looked like they were prepared to be moved and not put up with nonsense. I rolled my shoulders like an athlete in a body that forgot it was one, and I reached for the first thing I needed to bring my idea into the day\u2019s light. Outside the tent, the vines lifted their hands a little in the breeze like they were trying to get a question in. In my head, I could hear Jules saying, Control what you can, and the rest is for ghosts and editors, and I thought, Not today, friends. Today, everything I can hold, I will.\n\nThe first hour went the way you pray for without calling it prayer. Butter behaved, flour didn\u2019t sulk, sugar took the hint, and my hands moved in a rhythm that must have been in me from the days before I knew the names for things. I stamped the sabl\u00e9 cookies with the little ceramic press I had borrowed from Lena, the one that made a pattern like the lace on the dress I wore to the fancy fundraiser at the caf\u00e9 where we auctioned off croissants to rich people who didn\u2019t know how to eat them. I filled the tart shells with the curd that had learned me and set them on a tray like an army that wanted to be loved. I whipped egg whites with the calm that only comes when you have already cried about meringue enough times that it cannot surprise you, and I leaned my head into the heat of the torch like a cat visiting an altar and kissed the tips of each swirl with gold.\n\nThen the tent did a small trick, the one that turns the second hour into a test of breath. The wind picked up, the side of the marquee belled in, and something in the generator made a sound that could only be described as thoughtful. The lighting flickered like it wanted drama and then remembered the insurance. The hosts did a walk-through of how much time we had left and managed not to make it sound like a threat. The judges toured the room with their eyes and maybe a small part of their hearts. The sound man at my elbow whispered sorry as he adjusted a thing that had migrated across my shoulder blade, and I smiled like I was a person who could carry anything.\n\nI spun sugar because I am occasionally a fool. I heated it to that hard crack stage with the attention you would give a confession, then let it fall in threads off the fork onto the back of a greased ladle, forming little transparencies that would stand where I asked them to like obedient glass. It clumped in one corner when I got cocky and paid the price by burning half a pot that will smell like the end of the world until the end of time. I moved to the stove to rescue the caramel from becoming a weapon, and I bumped elbows with Arjun as he marched past with a tray of choux he had decided at the last minute to add because some people cannot help but be extra. We apologized in a choreography we have practiced for months. I assembled what I could and kept half an eye on the clock that is always a liar and always right.\n\nCherry flickered in my mind then, in the exact moment a patch of sugar cooled too much to bend to my will. It was the memory of the stutter, the suggestion of the little cough that had made me say not yet, not yet. I placed the sugar aside and reminded that part of my brain that there is no version of this day where going back to the car will fix anything except the way I talk to myself. The hosts swung by again with a comment about how pretty the sugar looked like winter on a glasshouse, and I told them I didn\u2019t believe in winter and they pretended to be scandalized and I laughed, which is to say I performed a small exorcism on the panic.\n\nWhen the third hour hit, it didn\u2019t ask for permission. Chocolate had to be melted again because it had gone off to sulk in a corner; coconut, which had been waiting politely, suddenly wanted attention like a toddler at a funeral; the curd asked to be trusted one more time and coasted over the line like a girl crowd-surfing. I placed the last tartlet and then moved three things half a centimetre like that would save us all. Behind me, Maia put her hand on her hip and closed her eyes for a second as if hearing an answer to a question she had not asked aloud. To my right, Arjun swore in a language that sounded like home to him, then grinned because sometimes it is a relief to hear yourself swear in your own words.\n\nWe did the final tidy the way you tidy the room where you were kissed for the first time\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter, but also it matters. The call came with that fake-chipper tone to put down our tools, and I did, even the part of me that thought I could stick one more little shard of sugar in and not have it collapse did. I stepped back from the bench and looked at the thing I had made, and it looked back at me with the face of every kitchen I have ever stood in. It was imperfect and glorious and had my fingerprints all over it, as every true thing does. When they asked me what it was, I said the sentence I had been afraid of saying because of what it gives away. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s a backyard afternoon with a mother I don\u2019t remember and a woman who taught me to say please to butter, and it\u2019s mine, and it wants you to sit down and stay.\u201d\n\nThey took their time. The cameras leaned in from their leashes. The judge cut one of the tartlets and let the curd sigh onto the plate, and the other judge broke a sabl\u00e9 between his fingers and listened to the sound like it could tell him my name. The hosts did their job and got out of the way in a way that deserves medals. I let the breath out of my body and did not take another one until they nodded at something I could not yet read as blessing or lesson.\n\nAnd then the thing happened that I had been waiting for without admitting it. A runner from Production appeared at the side of the tent as if conjured from a prayer, her face that particular calm that only ever means one of two things. She crossed to me with that delicate, unflappable walk you learn from carrying plates of hot food through rooms full of people looking at you. She touched two fingers to the place on my arm where skin is thinnest and spoke quietly enough that the microphones had to strain. \u201cNia,\u201d she said, gentle but with the weight of her being paid to tell the truth. \u201cBefore we do the judging. It\u2019s Mrs. Healy. They rang through. She asked that if we could find you, we would. She says she\u2019s fine and she\u2019s not fine, and she says to tell you to say what you meant to say anyway.\u201d\n\nThe tent, which had been a single sound all day, seemed to stand back to let me hear that sentence. There is a way that news moves through a body; it doesn\u2019t ask for your heart first. It goes straight for your knees and your taste and the little muscles in your face that keep you upright when the tide pulls. I nodded and then I shook my head and then I remembered how to hold my neck. \u201cIs there\u2014\u201d I started, and the runner, whose badge said TARA in looping letters, shook her head once like a person who had been told to be careful with the spirit she was handling.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s being looked after,\u201d Tara said, and when she said looked after it held a universe. \u201cShe wanted me to say, Make sure they smell the lemon. She was very clear on that. Do you want to call? Not now, but\u2014she wanted you to know before, not after.\u201d\n\nIf I had been alone, I would have become one of those people who kneel on kitchen floors. There is a tile back in Avondale that knows the shape of my knees. In the tent, with a camera pretending not to watch and a judge pretending not to care that they were watching, I did the thing I have learned to do. I built a little room inside myself and put the news in it with water and a blanket and said, I will be back in a minute, my love. I looked at the showstopper like it could tilt the world back into order, and then I looked at Tara and said, \u201cTell them I\u2019m ready,\u201d and meant it, which surprised me enough that I smiled.\n\nThe judging went on, because judging always goes on, because this is the deal we make with narrative. They ate our afternoons and our stubbornness and our faith in butter. They spoke in sentences that tried to hold the shape of fairness. They looked at us like we were trying to add something to the vocabulary of sugar and they were prepared to hear us out. When they got to me and asked what I called it, I didn\u2019t repeat the speech I had practiced because I am not a person who was built to say anything twice the same way. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s called Back Steps,\u201d and when they asked me why I told them about Mrs. Kline\u2019s note, about Renee\u2019s hands, about a girl who stood at the edge of a room and counted the plates in case there weren\u2019t enough, and about the first time I learned that you can feed a person and make them less alone for ten minutes. I said it like I was allowed to be a person who speaks in tents with lights on her face.\n\nThey nodded, and the pastry queen did that thing where she presses her lips together to keep something from escaping that might be mistaken for too much feeling. The other judge looked down at his notes and then up like he had remembered there was a person attached to the food. They said the curd was daring and the sabl\u00e9 carried the pattern like a secret, and they teased me about spinning sugar without a safety net like I believed in angels. They gave me one tiny fix I would make every time for the rest of my life\u2014the chocolate on the sponge could have been thinner still, like the line between being proud and being arrogant\u2014and then they handed me back my own afternoon, slightly rearranged but intact.\n\nAfter, when they sent us to be filmed pretending we were not about to be told our fates, I found a corner of the vineyard that had been left alone by humans for the morning. It was a little place behind a low wall where weeds had elected a council and a spider had written a letter to someone I will never meet. I pressed my phone between my hands until it warmed like a living thing and called the number for the hospice that I had learned without meaning to, the way you know the rhythm of your name spoken by someone who loves you.\n\nCoco answered because Coco always answers. The sound of the fluorescent lights came through like a gentle reprimand. She said my name like she was smoothing a tablecloth. She told me two things at once\u2014you did good, and she is thinking of you\u2014and then filled in all the little places between them with details so that I wouldn\u2019t have to imagine the wrong ones. Mrs. Healy had had a dip. The kind that makes the nurses speak softly and the day move sideways. She had refused being fussed over and then accepted a glass of water like a queen. She was letting the pills pull her into a place where she might see someone who has been waiting for her. She had, Coco said, asked me to listen very carefully when I heard whatever I was about to hear.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come tonight,\u201d I said, already counting the exits home in my head.\n\n\u201cCome if you can,\u201d Coco said, always practical. \u201cDrive like you have sense. Eat something. She hates it when you don\u2019t eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ate almonds,\u201d I said, which is not food, and Coco made the noise she makes when she doesn\u2019t agree but will let you make your own mistakes until you are ready to confess and be fed.\n\nBack in the tent, the air had found a new shape again. Someone had righted a light that had wanted to tilt into metaphor. The hosts were practising a line that would carry the right weight without sinking the room. Arjun flicked a crumb off the corner of his shirt with the kind of concentration normally reserved for tying knots, and Maia looked out at the vines and then back at her hands like she had just remembered where her power lives. We stood in the little semi-circle they had told us to stand in like a day care for grown-ups with oven burns, and we did the thing we had promised ourselves we would do a hundred times: we breathed and we did not let our faces give away every room inside of us.\n\nThey told us, because they must, who had stood a little taller today. They used the language that is decorous and decided by committees, and inside of it there were words that were for us alone. When they said my name in the way that meant I had done what I came to do, the world tilted but did not fall. I did not drop my face into my hands because I had been taught to be polite in public, but it would be a lie to say I did not picture doing it. They put a hand on my shoulder and did not hold on too hard. Arjun and Maia hugged me in a sandwich that smelled like sugar and clean steel, and I hugged them back in the exact way that meant I would buy their first books and send them messages when their babies were born, whether those babies were bread or breathing.\n\nAfter, when the images had been gathered and the people with the clipboards said we could be human beings again, I found a bench outside the tent where the sun had warmed a patch just for me. I sat down and put my head in my hands and then lifted it right back up because I could hear Renee in my bones telling me to mind my hair if I wanted to look like myself on camera later. I drank water until my ribs felt like they had been asked to stop being instruments and become a house. My phone buzzed again, and there was a message from Lena that was all caps and exclamation points and a picture of a tray of meringues that had been burned by a love that was too hot and then rescued anyway. There was one from Kahu that said simply, You did it? and another that said, I told the gulls, which made me laugh on a sound that startled a bee.\n\nThe day was not over, not by a long stretch. There would be interviews where I would tell the story like I had known all along what I was doing, and there would be shots of me walking down a row of vines that would make me look like a person who thinks in neat rows. There would be the packing away of the little kitchen I had built in an hour and a half, and the moment where everyone goes quiet for five seconds for a sound thing, and the way the tent looks when it is only a big, silly piece of fabric and not the inside of a dream. There would be the drive back through the afternoon, when the traffic would forget it remembered me this morning, and the stop at the dairy where the same man would sell me milk and I would tell him the cricket score he already knew. There would be the hospice in the blue hour, and the smell of lemon hand gel and hope, and the seat by the bed where I would put my elbows and fold my hands and say what I had meant to say to Mrs. Healy even if she was watching from a little ways away.\n\nI stood because standing seemed like a new thing to try. I walked because it would mean I might eventually get to the door. I put my hand on the tent pole at the edge of the world they had built and felt the whole structure shiver the way it does when a gust runs through, and I remembered the first time the gulls learned my name. They are not sentimental birds, gulls. They will take what you hold if you leave it on a table. They screamed my name like it was something to do to fill the morning. Today, they could have it. I had enough names for myself to share.",

I carried it past the caf\u00e9 counter where Lena double-checked her cinnamon to make a point, past the noticeboard at the dairy where someone had thumbtacked a flyer for a missing budgie named Shrek, past the hospice where the windows practiced being kind to everyone who looked through them. Production took me to a room with too much white and told me how to be myself, on message. Poppy put a fresh lanyard around my neck like it was a medal and showed me where to stand so the light forgave me. I smiled next to a pyramid of lemons that had been wiped to within an inch of their dignity and lifted a whisk with an expression that belonged on a saint who\u2019d been told the carving would last longer if she stopped moving. They needed photos of me that didn\u2019t look like anyone who had taken off their shoes in the kitchen at midnight to talk to a jar of curd, so I tried to imagine I was the kind of woman who could predict the weather by the sound the oven made when it settled.\n\nMrs. Healy began to drift like a boat untethered from a wharf she\u2019d been born beside and had always meant to leave. I went in the mornings with scones too soft inside and just proud enough on the outside to be forgiven, and in the afternoons with citrus tarts that looked like the sun had taken its hat off and stayed. Some days she woke sharp and clear and told me stories about a boy who had loved her once and brought her peaches so ripe they made the kitchen blush, about a garden where beans had climbed up into the roof and taught her that you can coax anything if you plant it with your whole chest. Other days, she floated somewhere gentle and let my voice fill the room like a radio left on low in another flat. Coco kept lavender at her wrists because she understood what it was to trick the air into thinking everything was less hard than it was, and she showed me how to tuck a blanket in at the corners like you were promising something you could keep. When pain came, it dropped its anchor and didn\u2019t pretend otherwise. Mrs. Healy would watch it like it was an uninvited guest at a party, then wave it into the kitchen and tell it there was tea, and if it wanted to stay it would have to listen to three jokes first.\n\nThe night I drove across town fast for no reason I could name, the sky was that thin indigo that reminds you how big it gets when you\u2019re not looking. Cherry hummed like a woman pretending to hum who is really pleading. The hospice doors opened with the hush of something practiced, and the nurse at the desk looked up and knew my name like she was expecting me, which, as it turned out, she was. The room was dim in the way of rooms that have decided to be kind by being quiet, and the lemon on the hand gel walked the line between hospital and heaven. Mrs. Healy\u2019s breath did the soft, stubborn work it had learned, and her hair was a crown of wild white spun sugar against the pillow. I sat where I always sat and told her everything about the tent except the part I wasn\u2019t allowed to say, and that made her smile, because the woman loved a rule that bent a little for the right person. When she woke enough to press my fingers with hers, she said, Don\u2019t get thin, remember to salt your butter, and when they cut you open with kindness, say thank you and then eat. I told her there was a tart cooling on my counter with her name on it. She said, Let it be for the living, then closed her eyes like a door that knows exactly where it is on its hinges.\n\nGrief has its own tight little chores. I buttered toast I didn\u2019t want and ate it because Coco\u2019s face told me I would be watched if I didn\u2019t. I went out to the car and cried in the exact shape of the steering wheel because sometimes that is the only place you can hold the sob and not spill it on someone else\u2019s shoes. Kahu turned up on the steps after sunup with two coffees and a bag of mandarins and a way of leaning his shoulder against mine that reminded my bones they were not hollow. We made lists even then\u2014death requires them as much as television does\u2014and put things on them we could tick off with a hand that shook less when it had something to do. The hospice women took my cake and turned it into a table that looked like a quilt. The knitting ladies put their spiky love into a blanket with a mistake in the corner on purpose so nothing would be asked to be perfect. Someone from the Tuesday group sang a song I didn\u2019t know I knew the words to, and when we carried Mrs. Healy out on a morning that had decided to be ordinary despite everything, the gulls went quiet at the window as if even they had a gentle bone.\n\nIt is strange, to lift a win that won\u2019t be public for weeks alongside a loss that is loud right now. I walked through days with my tongue caught between my teeth to keep from spilling, and every so often the secret would warm my pocket and threaten my mouth. Lena kept me on the machine and off the internet. People came into the caf\u00e9 and said things like, Are you that girl, and I\u2019d prefer an oat flat white if you have it, and my cat has developed a taste for brioche, and anyway, we\u2019re all proud of you, hun, and I took the coins and gave the change and tried to imagine every mouth had sugar in it. A man with paint under his nails who fixed fences for a living told me he\u2019d never watch a baking show on purpose, then asked if lamingtons had rules, and when I said they did, he nodded like it was good to know there were laws somewhere. I went to Tasi\u2019s with lamingtons and a brioche and he told me that Cherry was singing like a choir that had been paid in pies. He wiped his hands on a rag, said the word sister the way a man says it when he means more than blood, and offered to paint the tyres bench if I ever needed somewhere to sit people down and feed them for money.\n\nOn the day the episode would finally air, Auckland put on a sky as thin as muslin that let the light through anyway. We put a sign on the community centre door that said Bring a plate and a story, and the people showed up with both like they had been told there were only enough chairs for those who remembered who they were. Kahu borrowed the hospice projector because the hospice is generous in both directions, and wrangled an extension cord that had opinions about being tripped over. Tasi arrived with a tray of panipopo that made the air reconsider itself and a look like he had done something smug he wasn\u2019t going to brag about. Mrs. Kline came down the stairs with Beethoven in a little harness she had knit out of unlikely yarn and an expression that said she did not plan on asking permission to be present. Arjun texted a picture of three bowls he\u2019d set out on his kitchen table labelled salt, sugar, tears, and Jules called from Christchurch and propped their phone against a jar of pickles so I could watch the dance the light made across their wall when they laughed.\n\nThe room smelled like garlic bread, cheap paper plates, and a dozen secrets lightly salted. A boy I remembered from a house I left when I was eight turned up taller and softer and said, Do you remember the dog we weren\u2019t supposed to have, and I said, I remember the dog we had anyway. Lena organized people the way she organizes sugar on a bench, which is to say with efficiency and an eye for where sweetness is needed most. I put the Back Steps platter on a table near the wall with the peeling paint like a set piece for a life I recognized. The sabl\u00e9 had kept their pattern; the little tartlets sat like good children pretending not to be clever, and the meringue had not wept in the car, which felt like a personal miracle. We turned the volume up too loud at first because we were afraid of missing anything, then turned it down because the sound of ourselves was a better soundtrack than anything that had been edited for us.\n\nWatching yourself is an out-of-body experience if the body you leave behind is holding a plate of sausage rolls. I saw my hand before I saw my face, saw the way flour clung to the heel of my palm and the way I set a bowl down like it could startle. The tent looked cleaner and sillier than it had felt, and my bench looked like a place I had grown up by accident and only realized when I had to say goodbye. The hosts made jokes we had laughed at already and then again because they had been given a nicer home. The judges said words I knew they had said and they still felt like a hand on my shoulder when I needed it. The lamingtons didn\u2019t crumble under the chocolate this time, on screen. The mille-feuille cut clean as a sentence with no apologies. My mouth on camera said, It\u2019s called Back Steps, and I heard the ripple in the room behind me before the show heard it, and it sounded like a little neighbourhood saying we see you.\n\nWhen the moment came, they made an entire country hold its breath for exactly the length of time that makes you hate everyone with a clipboard and then forgive them all at once. They said my name. They said it without mangling it, with the a the way it is written, and someone had remembered the macron, and I felt that thing again that is not quite being born and not quite being undressed. The room went up like a pan deglazed with wine. The sound was a cheer and a laugh and a sob and the brittle clatter of cutlery hitting plates and not breaking. I was hugged from six directions by people who all thought they were the only one who knew to hold me under the ribs where it counts, and Beethoven screamed at the ceiling because that is how he expresses joy at scale. Lena cried like a kettle and pretended she\u2019d got something in her eye; Kahu stood on a chair and nearly fell off and then stood on it again because he liked being taller than a moment for once; Mrs. Kline whacked me on the arm with a bonne chance nobody asked her to translate, and Tasi slipped three savoury pies into my bag with a wink because he is a man who plans your hunger before you feel it.\n\nMy phone forgot how to be silent. Messages arrived like cicadas. Some were friends who had been holding their breath in other rooms. Some were strangers who wanted to tell me about the first time their grandmother had let them stir the batter and how they had never felt worthy since, and would I send them the recipe for feeling needed. One was from a woman named Beth who said she had sat in a kitchen with a woman named Renee who used to talk about a girl who whisked like she was trying to beat life into something that had forgotten itself, and was that possibly me. It was as if a match had been struck and left burning in my chest. Another was a number I didn\u2019t recognize that said simply, You made it taste like afternoons. The hospice sent me a picture of the TV in the staff room and three nurses pretending not to cry. The caf\u00e9\u2019s page tagged me in a post that said, Our girl, and a photo of a lamington that had tried its best and mostly succeeded.\n\nI took my plate of tartlets out onto the back steps because I had promised Mrs. Kline and because I needed air that had not been breathed by a hundred beloveds. The concrete held the heat like a lap. The alley smelled like jasmine and the world\u2019s oldest mop. A cat that was not Beethoven drifted past with the disposition of a poet trying to remember a rhyme for hunger. Down on the street, a gull stood on the bonnet of a stranger\u2019s car and contemplated its life with an admirable seriousness, then screamed two notes that somehow added up to my name. Jules\u2019 face wobbled on my phone in that way of video calls and then stilled, their smile big enough to tilt the moon. They didn\u2019t say Well? because friends who have the right kind of manners don\u2019t ruin a good question, but their eyes did the asking for them. I held up the last tart and bit into it and held the other half to the screen like a sacrament, and we both laughed for a while before we remembered what crying\u2019s for.\n\nBy the end of the night, the tables looked like a dozen small festivals had been held on them and everyone had gone home full. I wiped them down with water that turned flour to thick little ghosts under my cloth and put the chairs back where they would pretend to live until next time. People came and went in waves and left me with words I kept picking up later to see how they felt in the hand. A woman I didn\u2019t recognize hugged me and said, You\u2019ve changed nothing and everything, which I plan to embroider on the nearest tea towel. When almost everyone had left, Mrs. Kline tottered over with something wrapped in waxed paper and a look like she had been saving this too long and might break if she didn\u2019t pass it on. Inside was a photograph bleached at the edges and softened by too many summers, and in it, a younger me stood on a bench in a kitchen I had not visited in years, holding a wooden spoon like it was a microphone, while a woman with a scar at her eyebrow and hands like weather laughed behind me. On the back, in a blunt pencil, someone had written NIA + RENEE\u2019S SCONES\u2014FIRST TRY, and the year that made my stomach make a sound of its own.\n\n\u201cHow\u2014\u201d I tried, but Mrs. Kline was already nodding her head like a small, smug metronome.\n\n\u201cCommunity centre clear-out, long time ago,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one claimed the box. I don\u2019t like things that get lost. You can\u2019t keep every stray, but some of them will just live under the bed if you let them.\u201d\n\nI took the picture like it would jump. \u201cDo you know if\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s alive?\u201d Mrs. Kline\u2019s eyes were as kind as they have ever been and sharp as I have ever known them. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I know somebody who keeps track of people who keep track of people. I also know the way you said her name.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, the air tasted like it had rained without the sky admitting it. I woke to seventeen requests to make a cake that looked like a lighthouse and one to make biscuits shaped like a cat named Tango, and a very serious email from a morning show asking if I could be cheery at a time of day when I normally look like a cautionary tale. I said yes to what I could and no to the things that made my stomach clench, and I put the kettle on and sent a message to a market manager in Matakana asking about stall fees and whether you could share a power point without starting a family feud. Kahu came out of his room with his hair doing that thing where it looks like a hero fresh from a wind tunnel and waved a printout that said Business Plan Template as if it were a seashell he\u2019d found and wanted to teach to sing. He insisted his thesis brain could carry a bakery as easily as it could carry the price of water under colonialism, and I let him because it made him happy to have a new river to argue with.\n\nI went for a walk down to the shops because I wanted the world to confirm it had noticed nothing and also everything. A girl on a scooter grinned at me and said, Nice cakes, and didn\u2019t stop. The dairy man told me the cricket score before I asked and slid an extra barley sugar into my hand like I was a child who had managed not to cry at the hairdresser. Mr. Singh\u2019s wife told me in a whisper that she had started putting coconut on everything and that her husband now thought he was allergic to success. The florist two doors down had copied out a quote about living deliberately and hung it upside down in the window because the tape had ideas. The city kept being itself, which is to say, it carried me whether I knew it or not.\n\nAt home, I cleared the table with the reverence of someone laying out tools. The photograph went in the centre like a small altar. I wrote two lists\u2014one called Back Steps and one called People Who Knew Renee\u2014and I let the pencil choose how big the letters would be. On the Back Steps list, I wrote things like find a cheap oven that will not explode, learn how to say no to people who bring you avocados and expect cake, ask Tasi about a kettle big enough to bathe a baby in, file forms even if they feel like they are asking for pieces of you you need. On the other, I wrote names that tasted old on my tongue, a neighbour who had known everyone and had a memory like a recipe box, a social worker with soft shoes who had once cried in a hallway and thought no one had seen, a woman at the community centre who had kept her hair in a tight bun that could have been a weapon if you were foolish, and a boy who had called himself an only child even when he wasn\u2019t.\n\nAnd then\u2014because when life gives you a day you start a thing that will fail without witness\u2014I baked. Not for anyone who would pay me or write about me or hand me a ribbon, but for the back steps I could see from my kitchen window, the concrete sun-warmed and unglamorous and waiting. I made the scones from the old recipe whose card I had copied with the indecent care of a thief. I cut in the butter until the flour looked like it had been snowed on without malice, and I added the milk in the careful measure that sits somewhere between parsimony and love, and I patted the dough out with an open hand, which is really the only way to make it behave. I stamped circles with a glass that had once held cheap beer at a party I still haven\u2019t forgiven, brushed the tops with cream like a blessing, and baked them until they had the colour of good shoes. I took them outside with a jar of jam I had been saving and a tin of condensed milk nobody admits to but everyone uses when they have something to say in sugar.\n\nI sat on the step and split a scone and the steam made a point, and I put jam and milk on it and ate with my eyes closed because there are times when that is the only way to register your life. The alley hummed. The sun slid itself up over the roofline with the laziness of a cat at noon. A gull landed on the fencepost and looked at me like a judge. I held out the last bite because I am not above bribing the wild, and it took it and made a sound that would have been a laugh in any other animal. My phone buzzed in my pocket with a new message from an unknown number that began, I think I know where she is, and the blood rushed to the places inside me that usually only open for hot water and weather. I licked the jam off my thumb and looked at the photograph again and believed the thing hard enough that sometimes you get what you want. I believed that the steps you take because you promised someone you'd do a thing you said out loud are the kinds that make a small path appear where it wasn\u2019t before, and if you\u2019re lucky, and if you\u2019re stubborn, and if the gulls have learned your name, the path doesn\u2019t vanish when you stop looking.\n\nIn the days that followed, I learned to turn down some offers with a grace I know I didn\u2019t grow myself. A magazine wanted me to stand in a dress that would not forgive me if I ate lunch and hold a whisk like a baton; I said no with thanks and offered them a recipe that came with a paragraph about a woman with a scar in her eyebrow and a laugh that could teach a spoon its job. A radio show asked me to come on and talk about resilience, which I almost did until I remembered I am not a story you can bottle for commuting. The morning television took me anyway, a woman painted until I recognized myself only in the corners, and Poppy stood where I could see her and tipped her head when I started to talk too fast. I told the country to salt their butter and to stop being ashamed of their sweet tooth and to meet their neighbours because there is no recipe that doesn\u2019t start with that. Back at the caf\u00e9, Lena put me on dishes and told the staff that fame had not softened me, and I told her to tell them I had hidden my spine in the cutlery drawer.\n\nEvenings found me in front of cupboards with a phone tucked under my chin, calling numbers that had been given to me by numbers who remembered other numbers. People who keep track of people had been kinder to me than I deserved for most of my life; sometimes they were busy and sometimes they were weary, and mostly, they had stories that made us both sit down. A woman at a shelter told me Renee had taught a girl she wasn\u2019t related to how to tell the difference between the smell of soap and the smell of lies, and we were quiet for a bit because sometimes all you can do when given a detail like that is let it change the tilt of the room. An old landlord told me he\u2019d liked the way she always lined up her shoes by the door, ready to run if someone needed running after. A boy who had become a man with tattoos like declarations told me she had let him sleep on her couch and had made him pancakes she\u2019d called flapjacks with a voice that made him fill the sink to wash up like he could save something.\n\nThe lead from the message that had started with I think I know where she is pulled like a kite string. A nurse in Tauranga had heard a story about a woman who\u2019d moved down the coast to help a cousin and had stayed to look after a woman she had found crying on a bus. A man in a bar in \u014chope said his aunt had bought scones from someone who made them so right you remembered your dead when you ate them, and he was not a man who had meant to remember anyone that day. A library volunteer in Whakat\u0101ne sent me a photograph of a noticeboard where a flyer with a blunt pencil had advertised a Saturday baking class, Gold coin donation, No fuss, Don\u2019t be rude about my oven. The email came with a second photo of a woman\u2019s hands rolling a dough you could almost smell. She had a scar at her eyebrow. Her hair had gone silver like a mercy. The kind of hope that makes the ribs sore set up camp and started boiling water for tea.\n\nI asked Kahu if he wanted a road trip and he said he had an academic meeting and then laughed like that was a joke. We packed the car with bananas, a bag of scones that Lena had insisted on making though she swore she would never be sentimental in pastry again, two thermoses, a blanket that had seen better beaches, and the photograph in a plastic sleeve like it was a passport. Tasi checked Cherry\u2019s tyres and put his hand on the bonnet and told her to behave and then told me to call if she didn\u2019t and not to be proud about it. Mrs. Kline gave me a list of things to say to strangers if they looked at me like a feral child and reminded me that people in other cities are also people, which I accused her of knowing firsthand and she admitted quietly. Jules called to say, If it\u2019s not her, it is someone else someone will need you to bake for, and the sentence was a map.\n\nWe took the road east like we meant it. The city loosened its grip and the land remembered water, and the radio did that thing where it forgets your mood and then gets it right by accident. The sky decided to be neither spectacular nor sulking, the exact kind you can drive under without imagining anyone is watching you from behind it. On the Paeroa stretch, billboards told us who to vote for and where to buy tyres and how to get rid of a mould problem with vinegar and something that absolutely wasn\u2019t bleach, promise. At the big L&P bottle, we got out and took a picture we pretended not to take because we are not tourists even when we are, and Kahu said the thing about lemon and Paeroa and secret recipes in a voice that made even the sign look like it was tired of being asked. The gulls, somehow, had come east ahead of us and were waiting on a roof in the main street like a meeting had been called.\n\nWe found the community hall with the noticeboard without having to ask. The flyers on it were sun-faded except for the one with the blunt pencil\u2014a Saturday baking class with a date that suggested she had been here long enough for people to expect her on Saturdays. Inside, the hall smelled like varnish and shoes and something baked last week. A whiteboard announced a meeting of the midweek walkers and a raffle for a hamper that contained two kinds of chutney and a bottle of wine with a label that had birds on it. There were stacks of chairs that had known a hundred meetings where nothing happened and two where everything did. I stood in the doorway as if I could step into my own photograph. The room did not turn into a cathedral. It was just a room. You want that for your lives, if you are lucky: for things to be exactly themselves when you arrive in them.\n\nA woman came in from the kitchen with flour at the hinge of her thumb and a face I had learned in a place that smelled like rain and cheap deodorant. She stopped moving, briefly, in the way that points are made. The scar at her eyebrow lifted as if it wanted to be counted among the present. She said my name like it had never been mispronounced by a teacher and I hadn\u2019t left it behind anywhere, and I said hers like it couldn\u2019t have belonged to anyone else ever. We looked at each other with the caution you give something fragile that has forgotten it is also made of bone. Then she crossed the room with a dishtowel in one hand and a spoon in the other because no one who loves as their first language arrives empty, and she put her hand against my cheek the way she had put it there in a different kitchen in a different suburb on a day when the power had gone out and the gas oven had been a miracle.\n\n\u201cI taught you to cut butter with two knives,\u201d she said, and the knife in her voice had softened in the places where knives need to do that.\n\n\u201cAnd you told me not to throw away a batch,\u201d I said. \u201cEven the sinners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all of us saints sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you bring your own apron?\u201d\n\nI had. It was in the bag because I am a woman who prepares for polite ambushes. We went into the kitchen because it is the room where we know what to say. Kahu stood in the doorway like a cousin who understands this is not his scene and also entirely is, and he found a kettle and put it on because tea is an act of love too short to be misinterpreted. Renee took out one bowl, and then another, and put them down with a rhythm I recognized from rooms where I\u2019d had to count chairs and fights and silences. She handed me a bag of flour and said, Show me, and I showed her, and we did not speak for the length of time it takes to rub in butter with your fingertips until it disappears and reappears as weather.\n\nLater, we would say all the things that hurry to the edge of the mouth in reunions and decide which ones to let jump. We would lay out the years like towels on a fence and look at the stains and decide which ones mattered and which ones were simply proof we had lived. She would tell me where she had gone when she left the house in Avondale and why. I would tell her about Mrs. Healy and the tent and the gulls and the feeling of holding the wheel and telling the car not yet. She would tell me about the girls and the boys and the not-quite-grown she had taught to boil water without burning it and to make rice without breaking into pieces when it stuck. I would tell her about Back Steps and how a photograph you handed in a kitchen could become a place on a map you\u2019d been making with your whole body.\n\nFor now, we made scones because there are times when language has to be eaten before it can be understood. The oven in the hall was older than any of us and had the temperament of an auntie who would lend you money and call you at six in the morning to ask about it in a voice that actually wanted to know if you were warm enough. We put the tray in and crouched in front of the glass like hopeful children watching a trick, and when the tops browned and rose and leaned into each other like neighbours, we smiled with half our faces, the half that remembered each other from another life. We took them out and split one open and put butter on it and watched it melt, and then we put our tongues on the past and found it could be sweet without being untrue. We sat on the back steps of that hall, the same concrete as every hall in every town, and ate what we had made and looked at the road as if it had been waiting for us to sit down so it could continue.\n\nOutside, a child yelled something that didn\u2019t need translating. The gulls, late to the party for once, arrived in a ragged little cloud and argued about nothing on the roof. The sun found a way through the clouds like it always had a plan to arrive and was only being dramatic. It would be a long drive home, and then a longer run of days with forms and flour and the terrible joy of telling people where to stand and where to find the bathroom. There would be a market with a stall that would be mine and not mine because nothing we make is ever only ours. There would be a sign that said Back Steps in letters I would probably paint wrong the first time and then leave like that because perfection is boring. There would be mornings when the stove ran hot and evenings when the curd lined up in jars like good soldiers and nights when the gulls forgot my name and I learned not to mind because I had enough other names to answer to.\n\n\u201cAre you happy?\u201d Renee asked, not as an accusation but as a line you could tie a boat to.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d I said. \u201cMore often when there\u2019s butter.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmart girl,\u201d she said. \u201cBring your people here on Saturdays if you like. We can teach a lot of ladies with sharp elbows how not to cut scones like murderers.\u201d\n\nWe laughed because it was the right noise. We ate another scone because life is short and then long and then complicated, and you need to have something in your hands for all of it. The day didn\u2019t clap or bow or take our picture. It did the better thing. It stayed.",

Papers appeared that wanted my full name in block letters and my grandmother\u2019s maiden name like a test I hadn\u2019t studied for. The market manager in Matakana sent a cheery email with a PDF attached that looked friendly until it mentioned food safety, access to potable water, and whether I owned a gazebo that wouldn\u2019t murder a child if the wind got ambitious. Kahu put his thesis into a drawer like a lover he\u2019d promised to call and pulled out a dry-erase marker with the lust of a man who\u2019d been waiting his whole life to draw a Gantt chart. He wrote Back Steps across the top of the whiteboard on our fridge in letters that got bolder with each loop, then stood back with his arms crossed like a small, pleased god.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bakery,\u201d he said, as if correcting a child. \u201cIt\u2019s a project. A kaupapa. A moving kitchen. A way to make people less annoyed at mornings.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a table,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd my job is to make sure there\u2019s enough to put on it.\u201d\n\nHe nodded with the seriousness of a man who did not plan to let gravity get in the way of his enthusiasm. He assigned himself the task of sign procurement and logo design with a flourish, then reached for his phone to text three friends who all had opinions about fonts. We learned that there are arguments you cannot avoid if you love anything: what to call the shade of green that says leaf and not toothpaste, whether a macron should sit above a letter if you cannot guarantee the printer will respect it, how many gulls you can draw before it becomes a children\u2019s book. The sign arrived a week later, painted by someone in Grey Lynn who\u2019d done bands and barbershops and one wedding he refused to be held responsible for. BACK STEPS, it said, in a hand that looked like it would swear for you if necessary. The S leaned into the P as if sharing a secret.\n\nRenee travelled up on a Friday with a sack of lemons from a tree that had decided to be generous and a list of people she thought we should ask for help. She wrote their names on an envelope with her thumb pressed against the paper like she could steady the future through friction. She had a way of leaning on the bench with her hip that made every kitchen she entered look like it had been waiting; when the kettle boiled, she tilted her head to listen as if it were about to sing something particular for her. We worked through the food safety check with the sort of laughing that makes inspectors less inclined to reject you. The man from the council was gentle and alarmingly thorough. He wanted to know if my thermometers were calibrated, whether I had a handwashing setup that would function even if the power cut without warning, whether my wiping cloths were of a colour that wouldn\u2019t hide blood if I did something stupid to myself. He watched me wash my hands as if he had been asked to write a sonnet about it. By the time he left, he had a bag of lemon slices and the knowledge that we would not poison anyone on purpose.\n\nThe first Saturday was a rehearsal for a life. We loaded Cherry with tables, an Esky full of curd and cream and butter that had all the excitement of a hen party on a ferry, a stack of brown paper bags we\u2019d stamped with the new logo until the kitchen smelled like ink, and three dozen scones Renee called insurance. The sign fit in the backseat like a passenger, and I buckled it in because I didn\u2019t trust physics. At the market, the air had the feel of a poem that had been rewritten until it could be read out loud without making its owner blush. Stalls lined up and pretended to be orderly. Someone sold candles with names like Quiet Field and Monday Morning; someone else had knitted child-sized hats with ears that would ruin them for life in the best way; a beekeeper stood behind a run of jars like he was offering parts of the sun for a reasonable price and told everyone who paused that his girls were in a good mood today. The woman at the end wore a T-shirt that said BREAD IS MY LOVE LANGUAGE and thick socks and a smile that made me want to hand her all my secrets.\n\nWe set up the gazebo with the clumsiness of people who have never triangulated anything. The wind came across the vines with the intention of reminding us it had been here first. A man appeared as if conjured, tightened a knob Kahu had been wooing for fifteen minutes, drove a peg into a patch of ground that had ideas about staying inviolate, and faded back into the general population with a nod. I made a chalkboard menu in handwriting that would have made my year ten teacher sigh. Back Steps: feijoa lemon tartlets, scones with jam and condensed milk, hyped-up lamingtons, shortbread like you forgot to behave, coffee from Lena\u2019s machine if the power fairy stays with us. Renee added and a slice of something if we don\u2019t eat it first in a neat slope to the corner. We put the plate of samples at the front and the spoon in the jar of curd within my arm\u2019s reach as if I were offering communion. The gulls did a low reconnaissance pass, then decided we were either not generous or not interesting and went to harass a child who had unwrapped a muesli bar with the assurance of the unafraid.\n\nPeople came. That first hour tasted like a childhood birthday party where everyone actually turns up. The early risers with their canvas bags and opinions on tomatoes stopped and nodded as if we had met somewhere else in a life with better lighting. The kids came for the lamingtons and stayed to argue about what feijoa tastes like to people who think they hate it. One woman bought six tartlets and told me they were for a book club that read crime novels but always ended up talking about neighbours, and that she had once tried to kiss a man while holding a pavlova and it had ended in tragedy. An old man with a cap that had seen carbon-something war asked if I sold custard squares and when I said not yet, he bought shortbread as if forgiving me. Lena turned up with her hair tucked under a cap because the wind refused to play nice, set up a plug-in coffee exterior to our stall, and began issuing flat whites like absolution. By mid-morning, I had the specific ache in my lower back that means you are alive and doing something that matters to you, and my hands had begun to smell permanently like lemon, sugar, and something like courage.\n\nA woman with a lanyard that said HEALTH in capital letters came by and summarized our business plan by the way she kept her mouth soft while her eyes did their inspections. She asked me about temperature logs and holding times and whether I had a separate utensil for raw and cooked, and my heart did not climb into my throat because I had kept my promise to myself about control where there is control to be had. She told me her favourite dessert was jelly that pretends it\u2019s grown-up, then bought a lamington and ate it like she had earned it. I tucked the first real stack of notes into the little tin we kept in a paper bag under the table and did not think too hard about whether this was security or superstition. Kahu ran crowd control for us with a clipboard and a smile that made people say yes to standing where he put them. He had made a pre-order list that made me want to cry from relief. He had also, I discovered later that afternoon, quietly told two teenagers who had turned feral in the queue that if they wanted to fight, they could fight him, and then made them hold our spare pegs while he told them they were hired.\n\nAfter lunch, the sky remembered that weather in this country does not ask for permission. The marquee line shivered like a thing having a thought, and a single, fat drop landed on the corner of my chalkboard and smudged the word lemon into something that looked briefly like lonely. I wanted to call it an omen and then told myself to grow up. Then the wind came sideways, ambitious and rude, and lifted one leg of the gazebo with a smoothness that made my spine behave like a wire. The teacups rattled like a warning. The scones considered committing seppuku. Renee said, without raising her voice, \u201cHand me that spoon and the guy rope,\u201d in a way that made me grin even while I ran for both. The beekeeper appeared at my elbow with a weight that had once been a brick and now was a solution. Between us, and the helpful man who had pegged us earlier and now materialized with a face like a farmer\u2019s weather report, we battened the thing down with the confidence of people who had been blown around by bigger forces and were still here to tell stories.\n\nIt rained properly for seven minutes. Properly as in loudly and with an enthusiasm generally reserved for baptisms and late trains. We laughed in the way you do when you can hear your own ridiculousness and can\u2019t do anything about it. People queued anyway; there is nothing more stubborn than a New Zealander in wet socks looking at a pastry. The shortbread kept its dignity. The lamingtons did what they always do and took on the weather like it was a personality trait. A child in a yellow raincoat that made them look like a lemon with opinions announced to the line at large that they were five and had eaten four lamingtons and their mother was not to be told, and seven strangers conspired to become complicit. At some point, someone put a hot hand around my upper arm and when I turned, Jules was there, rain squinting into their eyes, a beanie flattened against their head like a bird that had made peace with being wet. They had flown up in the morning because they had never learned the trick of resisting a good story that needed a pair of hands.\n\n\u201cYour tent is flirting with me,\u201d they said. \u201cIt keeps lifting its skirt and showing me its ankles. I brought secret brownies. They\u2019re for you and nobody else because I\u2019m stingy about my love.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve come all this way to bribe me,\u201d I said, taking the Tupperware like I had never been given anything worth holding.\n\n\u201cI came to work,\u201d they said, already taking a towel to the counter the way a good friend will put their hands on a thing without being asked. \u201cAnd to tell you, because I remember how it feels, that you\u2019re allowed to sit down for exactly five minutes right now and you will not die and the world will not catch fire.\u201d\n\nI sat. I did not die. The world continued to go on being too much and just enough. The brownies were obscene and restorative and tasted like dark chocolate married to salt in a way that made me consider writing a congratulations card. Jules ran interference with a woman who wanted to argue about whether the coconut should be toasted and parried her in two languages until she was smiling like a person who remembered she had come here because food makes mornings kind. We closed with the sort of relief that is not unmixed, because relief never is in lives like this. The last tartlet went to a girl with a skateboard under her arm who said lemon tasted like the part of the afternoon where you don\u2019t have to be anywhere yet. The last scone went to a man in hi-vis who told us he\u2019d been on night shift and didn\u2019t trust the sun anymore, and we told him to trust butter instead and he said he\u2019d give it a go.\n\nAt home that night, I counted money in little stacks as if numbers looked better in tidy groups and could be convinced of their manners. The take would not save us from the price of Auckland, but it would pay for next Saturday\u2019s butter without my stomach becoming a knot that woke me at three. There were messages on the Back Steps page from people who wanted us at their school fundraisers and their office parties and their aunties\u2019 birthdays. There were also two notes offering to tell me what I should have done differently, and I read them with the careful attention you give your own bad dreams, then told them to wait their turn and shut the door. I ran a bath that convinced me I could forgive my feet for their day, and I thought about the room at the hospice where Mrs. Healy had told me to salt my butter and eat even when I did not want to, and I ate anyway because ghosts are right about so many things. When I came out, the sign leaned against the wall like it had learned how to hold the room, and Kahu was asleep on the couch under a blanket Mrs. Kline had knit with a pattern she refused to reveal.\n\nOn Tuesday, there was a memorial in the hospice courtyard that smelled like lemon gel and cut grass and the hard sweetness of chrysanthemums. We put Mrs. Healy\u2019s name on a sheet and the pen left a line that would be permanent in a book someone\u2019s grandchild would hold in fifty years and say, Who was she. I spoke about scones and about a woman who would tell pain to sit down and have some tea if it wanted to stay. I said grief was a second language I had learned at the age when you are supposed to be learning your times tables and that I was tired and grateful in equal measure. The knitting ladies sat in a row like a choir and one of them sang a grace in a voice that had rubbed against a lot of air. Coco stood by the table where we put our plates and said, Take as much as you can carry, because food is the only appropriate inheritance we offer here. When we went back inside to the small bustle of the living, the hallway seemed to widen to let us through. I stood in the kitchen for a minute and put my hands on the bench and thought, as I always do in kitchens where the air has held grief, about what comes next that is small and doable.\n\nAfter, business grew like a scruffy hedge that no council would discourage because it kept the wind off the neighbours. We made markets a habit and then, to our alarm, a reputation. People started saying we were their Saturday on the way to something else, which is a compliment you should write on your wall if you get it. I learned how to say no to the man who wanted me to bake his girlfriend a cake shaped like a jet ski, and yes to the nan in Sandringham who wanted me to show her mokopuna how to cut butter into flour without making it cross. Renee drove up every second weekend with a bag of lemons that made my back complain and a list of stories she had stored up like fruit in a pantry. She told me she had been in a house with a girl called Rua who had taught her how to braid bread with eyes shut, and in another house where she had taught a boy called Sam to make a roux that didn\u2019t clump and he had cried when it did what it was supposed to because he was twenty-three and no one had believed him about anything else.\n\nWe started the Saturday classes with a budget like a thrift shop and a thirst like a drought. The hall in Whakat\u0101ne agreed to let us use the kitchen if we cleaned it better than we found it and left scones for the caretaker. In Auckland, the community centre unlocked the doors with the kind of generosity that comes from being used to your own heart being broken. The first class, a handful of women arrived with sharp elbows and sharper laughter, a man who had come because his grandkid had called him out on burning toast, two teenagers with chipped nail polish and eyes that did not leave the counter because they had learned that looking up could make you a target, and a lawyer who whispered to me that she ate biscuits in her car because she could not go home yet, sometimes, and is that a normal thing to admit to a stranger. We put flour on everyone\u2019s hands because there is no way to keep flour off you that doesn\u2019t involve lies. Mangling a dough together is both skill and rite, and watching people learn the texture of togetherness makes you feel like a thief who has been allowed to keep what she stole.\n\nRenee and I developed a patter that would have been a double act if we had rehearsed it. She did the part where she told them to fold it like you meant the apology, and I did the part where I made them stop when their faces turned into the faces of their mothers. We handed people a knife who had not been handed anything sharp with trust, ever, and watched their shoulders come down when nothing bad happened and the butter behaved. We did a class at the hospice for the nurses and the women who had been there longer than the nurses, a class where salt was measured by sentence and sugar by story. Coco rolled pastry like she was smoothing people into their beds, and Mrs. Kline showed up with Beethoven in the harness only to direct traffic from a chair and tell everyone to watch their corners like a general. At the end of the first cycle, we stood on the back steps with paper plates and the kind of look between us that says we are doing a thing we meant to do and how ridiculous is that.\n\nThe practicalities behaved in their own messy way. I learned how to order butter wholesale without crying, how to asterisk my invoices so they would be seen by people whose inboxes were always on fire, how to speak to the woman in Council who held the power to deny me electricity with the respect due to a queen. Tasi built me a box that held the generator like a spoiled child and could be locked with a look. He came to the market one Saturday with his niece and bought two lamingtons and one scone and a coffee he pronounced good in the way you do when you love someone and are not going to lie to them. Kahu\u2019s thesis came back with comments and he wrote them like a man who had been asked to sand a floor for the third time and decided to do it barefoot. He told me in the kitchen at midnight that sometimes he counted the chairs in our flat still, reflexive and unnecessary, and we laughed because neither of us needed the number anymore and that felt like winning something.\n\nThe letter turned up on a Wednesday that was tired of pretending to be Tuesday. It was in an envelope that had been addressed by someone with a long-standing love affair with cursive. The stamp was a wahine with hair like a wave. No return address. Inside, a single sheet of paper, blue-inked and careful, that began with my name and did not commit to any claims about me beyond that. It said, in a hand that had learned long ago how to be careful with its loops, that there had once been a woman in Ponsonby who baked quietly and hoped loudly, who had loved scones as if they could save people and believed that flour did not ask too many questions. It said the woman\u2019s name as if I would recognize it and I did not, and then it said a second name, one my bones knew: Aunty Moana had kept other names for other people, and if I wanted to find the woman who had laughed at the gas oven like a miracle, I might try the block of flats on Norfolk Street where the man at Number Five collected bottle caps and left them on his windowsill in neat rows. It was not a promise. It was a nudge. Sometimes that is better. The signature at the bottom was a squiggle that belonged to someone who had not decided if she would be known.\n\nI held the letter and thought about what it costs to go backwards. You don\u2019t get to take the body you have now into a room where you were small. You must decide whether you are old enough to disappoint someone who might expect a child. I rang Jules and told them I had been given a puzzle in a country already full of puzzles, and they told me to remember that grief and joy both think they own the letterbox. I put the letter on the fridge behind the magnet that held the directions to the vineyard once and now held a list of who needed to be called about the next class. Then I called the number at the bottom, and it rang twice and then someone\u2019s breath answered like a door opening in a house I had never lived in.\n\n\u201cIs this Nia,\u201d she asked, in a voice that smelled like tea, \u201cNia who bakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I said, and the sound I made was not a laugh but had the honesty of one. \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who told your Renee she didn\u2019t know what she was doing,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAnd then watched her do it. My name is very old and not interesting. My nephew lives downstairs and he watches your show repeatedly. I live upstairs and I watch my neighbours. If you want to come sit and watch me watch them, bring biscuits. If you don\u2019t, then disregard. I am not above being ignored by the young.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never been good at ignoring instruction,\u201d I said. \u201cI can come Thursday. Is there anything you hate besides raisins?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate men who talk during the notices at the beginning of the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd people who put fondant on cakes when what cake wants is frosting or nothing. Bring whatever you bring. The man at Number Five won\u2019t answer the bell. He\u2019s shy because he pretends he smoked once when he didn\u2019t. Knock on the door to the right. I\u2019m the one with too many plants and an opinion on everything.\u201d\n\nWe went on Thursday. Kahu insisted on coming because he likes to meet the narrators of my life, and because he had a superstition about me walking into places with long hallways alone. Norfolk Street was that part of the city that remembers when it was more tired and less expensive. The block of flats had seen people arrive with suitcases and leave with debts and love. The stairwell smelled like damp carpet and curry and bleach that had done its best. On the landing, the bottle caps shone like small moons. A cat that had not signed a lease tried to trip us and then decided against it. A woman opened the door before we knocked and stood with her hand on her hip as if balancing the block with that one hinge in her body. Bo, she said her name was, Bo like a tie, Bo like a tilt of the head, Bo like a person who would keep a secret for the right reasons.\n\nShe had a couch that had held six lives. She had plants that had learned to grow toward a window that did not promise them anything. She had a photograph on a shelf of a woman with a scar by her eyebrow laughing at a girl holding a spoon like a joke. She made us tea and poured it high, and called me girl twice and child once and Kahu boy in a way that wasn\u2019t diminishment, only a reminder that we were not as old as our worries. She told me she had known a man who had been in love with my mother once, long ago, and that this was not a story that ended with me at her door. She told me my mother had a way of leaving that looked like arriving because she always turned when she went, and sometimes that confused people into thinking she had stayed. She told me she had seen her ten years back on a bus going to Henderson with a bag of oranges and a look like she\u2019d been told she could raise someone else\u2019s child for a week.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to say she was good,\u201d Bo asked, not unkind. \u201cDo you want to hate her? Do you want me to tell you the shape of her mouth when she said your name because the truth is I don\u2019t know if she ever did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want the part that is true,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd maybe a direction to face when I wake up at three.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing about mothers is they are people,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that\u2019s blasphemy in some countries. She stood outside herself and didn\u2019t always go back in. Renee went back in. Some people do. It is not noble. It is a choice. That is worse. You can\u2019t blame a disease for it.\u201d\n\nWe ate the biscuits I had brought, which had been meant to be shortbread and had turned into something else because I had been thinking too hard about the butter. Bo approved with the severity of a teacher and then leaned on her window sill to watch a man in a hat feed pigeons outside the dairy. She gave me two more names and the advice that if I got to a door and the person behind it wouldn\u2019t look me in the face, I could look at their hands instead because hands don\u2019t lie without telling on themselves. She told me if I found her, my mother, to not expect her to be grateful for being found, and if I didn\u2019t, to stop thinking that failing to find a person is the same as failing to be one.\n\nWhen we left, the gulls were arguing with a rubbish bin like the bin had started it. Kahu stood under the Norfolk pine that had done time as a Christmas tree in a hundred letterboxes and looked at me like he was asking if I was a house he could check the weatherboards on. I leaned against him because my legs weren\u2019t sure who they were supposed to be at that hour. We went to Lena\u2019s and stood behind the machine while she made three coffees with the concentration of a surgeon and pretended not to want to ask what the woman had said. I told her anyway, in pieces that had to be fitted together to make any sense. The world did not clap. It did the better thing and kept being itself. The afternoon turned into the kind where the clouds take up a strong opinion about who the sky belongs to, and I put my apron on and my list down and let my hands do what they know while my head went somewhere with a letter and a staircase and a photo and a woman who laughed as if failure could be baked out of flour if you loved it hard enough.\n\nBusiness got busier and then got complicated in ways money has a way of inventing. An influencer with teeth like an advertisement came to a market and took photographs with our sign and my hands and announced to a world I was not in the habit of visiting that Back Steps was the new thing and that I seemed \u201cauthentically local, like a pie on a long bus trip.\u201d Orders exploded in a way that would have looked perfect in a montage. I spent nights counting eggs and lost the thread on three conversations in a day because the part of my brain that tracks almond deliveries was shouting over the part that noticed people\u2019s faces. Kahu said the words hire someone with the gravity some men use to say I love you and I pretended to ignore him and then did it, because he was right and because my shoulders had started to forget down. Our someone was a woman named Sila who smelled permanently of coriander, had a laugh that removed splinters, and could balance six plates on her forearm like a circus act while telling a story about a man who had come into her restaurant every Friday for a year to order the same thing and how when he died, she had made a plate for him anyway and put it on the corner table and let it get cold.\n\nWe let Back Steps be more than the stall. We made Wednesday nights at the hall something, too, a place where you could come with nothing and leave with a biscuit and maybe a recipe that would make you less afraid of yourself for ten minutes. We put a little jar by the door with a sign that said Give if you can, Take if you need, and a list of things we would trade baking for: a ride to the hospice, a guitar lesson for the kid with the skateboard, an hour of babysitting for the lawyer who needed a date with no law in it, a crochet lesson for Kahu because he had decided his thesis would be better if his fingers learned new patience. The jar behaved like a tide. Some weeks it was too full to lift. Some weeks it was empty and so were we and then someone would put two coins in it in a way that made me look away and think about jamming and generosity and how close they sit together in the mouth.\n\nThe night the power went out just as I was about to pull the tart shells and the kitchen filled with the kind of pitch that makes your bones hum, Jules lit three candles with the solemnity of a priest and said the sentence that heard the room take a breath: \u201cWe know how to bake by feel.\u201d We finished by touch and by ear and stood on the back steps with a tray of tarts that had survived their own making and ate them with fingers and we remembered the old trick of licking sugar off our knuckles like we had invented it. When the lights came back on, everyone clapped in that automatic way people clap for electricity, as if apologizing to it for forgetting it is a miracle.\n\nThings kept arriving. A letter from a school in \u014ctara asking if I\u2019d speak to a class about finding a life you don\u2019t have to apologize for on Mondays. A message from a man in Australia who watched me on television while he fed his daughter at three a.m. and cried into her hair because his mother had made lamingtons for funerals and nobody did anymore where he was. A small, serious boy in a Star Wars T-shirt who came to the stall three weeks running with a coin exactly counted out and asked if I had ever thought of putting Milo in biscuit dough, and when I laughed and said we could try, he looked at me like I had given him a spare room. A woman with a shaved head who listened to me explain feijoa curd and then leaned across the table and told me in the voice you use when you\u2019re brave that she hadn\u2019t tasted anything in six months and maybe this would be the thing that brought her back to herself. It did. She came back the next week and cried so quietly about it that the world didn\u2019t notice. We did.\n\nWhen we went back to the vineyard for a charity event, I put my hand on the same tent pole just to see if it remembered me. It shivered like a friend you pass in a supermarket who\u2019s trying to work out where you know each other from. The air had different names and the vines had grown like people who\u2019d made decisions. Someone asked me to speak into a microphone and I did it like I hadn\u2019t once been the girl who learned to make herself as small as a spoon. Later, standing by the car with the boot open and the night finally remembering to be dark, Arjun called from a place with snow in the corner of the window and told me he had a kitchen with a bench that didn\u2019t wobble and a child who had decided bread was both food and toy. Maia sent a photo of a tray of fried bread her aunties had commandeered and said, Come over; and promised me a corner of a table to sit in while the women told me things I could not hear anywhere else.\n\nOn a Sunday afternoon that had decided to be a bowl rather than a plate, I sat on our own back step with my knees up and the city doing that low hum it does when it is not trying to impress anybody. Renee called from Whakat\u0101ne to tell me she\u2019d burned a batch of jam and salvaged it with whiskey because life is nothing if not an argument with sugar. Kahu read me a paragraph of his thesis that made my breath do a trick and then pretended he had made me cry by accident. I licked a smear of curd off my thumb and looked at the line of ants investigating a crumb and thought, with the calm of a person who has had enough and not enough, that I had made a place that looked like me and that the world had decided, for the moment, to sit down. The gull on the fencepost opened its beak with malice and affection both and screamed in two notes that were almost, but not quite, my name. Somewhere in the pile of papers on the table behind me, a letter waited with a name on it that had always been mine. Somewhere down the street, a woman was hanging out washing and thinking about bread. Somewhere in a hall that smelled of varnish and old biscuits, someone would come on Saturday with their sharp elbows, and I would put flour on their hands, and together we would turn a bowl of ingredients into something you could eat, which has always been my favourite magic.",

The morning light came early enough to catch me peering into mixing bowls like they had advice to give. Back Steps had settled into a rhythm that made sense to my ribs. Mondays were inventory and lists and accepting that butter cost what it cost no matter how nicely you asked. Tuesdays were deliveries and the kind of cleaning you do when you pretend you\u2019re thinking about something else. Wednesdays were the hall classes that turned strangers into people who corrected each other\u2019s flour measurements gently. Thursdays were for experimenting and burning a tray of something on purpose just to remember it happens. Fridays, Renee would arrive with a bag of lemons and a story, and Saturdays were the market, where we put on our best selves and then forgave each other when we were our second-best.\n\nThe school in \u014ctara wrote again and did the thing I respect most in a request: they put times and names and a room number in the subject line. I said yes because I wanted to plant a seed in a building that knew about storms. Kahu pretended he wasn\u2019t coming and then turned up in the doorway of my room with a stack of handouts he had designed that made the act of cutting butter look like a religious rite. We loaded the car with bowls and a bag of flour and two boxes of shortbread that had turned out odd because the oven had run hotter than usual and would therefore be radical and unforgettable. Cherry, having been spoken to sternly and bribed with a new air freshener that smelled more like laundry than lies, started obediently on the second try.\n\nThe classroom smelled exactly like every classroom I have ever loved and resented: whiteboard marker, too many backpacks, and somebody\u2019s lunch trying to make friends. The kids were a mix of sharp elbows and practiced slouches, hoodies and hair gel and eyes with the old look. The teacher had the tolerance of a woman who had chosen this life on purpose and leaned on the back bench with her hands, not her hip, as if the room were a boat and she knew where to stand. We talked about baking like it was a language that would let you visit without embarrassment. I told them the secret of scones was to treat the dough like a creature you could startle and that the way you hold a knife tells the world how you\u2019ve been held. A boy at the back who wore his hair like he had cut it himself asked if I was on that show, and when I admitted it, he grinned with too many teeth and said, \u201cMy nan hates you for what you said about jam,\u201d and I told him to tell his nan that I would duel her with curd anytime and he laughed so hard he fell off his chair and then put himself back on it with dignity.\n\nWe rubbed butter into flour, and the room got quiet in that way that means everyone\u2019s hands are occupied and the body remembers that stillness is not laziness. A girl with bitten nails pressed the dough with the heel of her hand and then looked at me like she\u2019d been caught, and I said, \u201cGentler,\u201d and her shoulders dropped three centimeters like I\u2019d handed her a warmer coat. We took the trays to the canteen oven and the lunch lady, who had seen more chaos than any of us, told me she\u2019d never liked scones because they were dry and I said, \u201cLet\u2019s make you a liar.\u201d When the smell moved through the corridor, a man in a tie appeared at the door with the look of someone who often has to ask for money and is sometimes given it, and we fed him with the rest. The children ate and licked their thumbs and tried the word \u201csable\u201d on their tongues and discovered it tasted like sand if you said it as if you didn\u2019t respect French. When it was time to go, a girl with plaits counted out exact change for a lamington as if paying me gave her permission to enjoy it, and the teacher put her hand on my arm and said, \u201cCome back,\u201d and I said I would and meant it with my whole chest.\n\nBack at the hall that evening, Jules leaned their hip against the bench and told a story about a caf\u00e9 that had installed a slide instead of stairs because the owner thought fun and coffee should be adjacent and how within a week everyone had broken a tailbone and no one could tell if it was because of joy or bad design. They had decided to stay in Auckland for a while because Christchurch had been hard on them in a quiet, efficient way. There was a spare room in a flat in Kingsland where the shower was either arctic or hell and the neighbours played the saxophone at reasonable volumes, which somehow makes it worse. I wanted them closer the way you want someone else to turn up to a thing you\u2019re nervous about without having to ask. We baked a batch of biscuits with Milo just because a boy had asked, and they came out the exact shade of school lost property, a taste like the quiet part of the afternoon on a carpet you used to hate. When we put them on a plate, Kahu stole one, pronounced it a cultural moment, and drafted a plan to letterbox the recipe around the neighbourhood like urgent political literature.\n\nThe letter from the council about the stall permit renewal arrived with a form attached that seemed to have been designed by a man who had never stepped outside. Somewhere between the sections titled HYGIENE PRACTICES and APPROVED WATER SOURCE ASSURANCES was a line that asked if I had access to inclement weather. I wrote yes because there was nowhere to write obviously. The health inspector came again, less stern this time, and admired our handwashing station like a friend. She told me someone had complained to her that our lamingtons were too generous and she had written back, \u201cFind a better adjective,\u201d which made me trust her for life. She also told me there\u2019d been a butter shortage brewing like a quiet storm and advised me to spread my orders across suppliers in a way that suggested she had rescued more stalls than mine. I started buying butter like canned peaches in wartime and learned my wrists could carry more than I had given them credit for.\n\nBo phoned on a Wednesday when I was halfway through burning a batch of candied peel. The sound of her voice on my mobile made my spine think I was at a payphone. She had that calm that sometimes means there\u2019s a sting at the end. \u201cYour mother,\u201d she said, dispensing with the part where we pretend this is casual gossip about a neighbour\u2019s boyfriend, \u201chas been seen at the op shop at the end of Richmond Road. Mondays. Helping with the bags no one wants to carry. She wears a scarf even when it\u2019s warm. The girl who told me has the kind of memory I don\u2019t argue with. If you go, don\u2019t expect anything that tidy. And eat first, so you don\u2019t behave like a person who hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI put the phone down and stood in the kitchen for longer than the situation warranted, but grief and hope both ask for stillness where you might give them movement. I told Kahu by leaving the kettle on and sitting at the table without touching a pencil. He made tea and didn\u2019t ask if I was sure, because neither of us had the right to that question. I told Renee by sending her three lemon emojis and a picture of my left hand, the one with the knuckle I busted when I was thirteen and slammed it into a door that was not the problem. She replied with a single word\u2014Steady\u2014and a photo of her own hand with the scar by the eyebrow in the background. Jules arrived without knocking because doors mean different things to people who have had to hold them shut. They sat with me and made a list that had exactly six items: eat an actual meal, don\u2019t go alone, bring very small biscuits, say your name out loud first, don\u2019t rescue anyone, breathe even if it feels like you\u2019re stealing air.\n\nWe went on a Monday because spell and habit are cousins. The op shop had the smell of old coats and the generosity of old ladies making do. The racks were packed with clothes that had seen better rooms and were willing to try again. A staff member with purple hair and a nose ring that said she\u2019d probably volunteer at three different things told us that if we were here to dump a bag outside after hours, we could go straight to jail. I told her we were here to buy a teapot with a chip and she laughed like she was pleased to meet a liar. The scarves were in a basket, the kind you have to rustle to let them know you mean it. She was there, not as a miracle and not as an apparition, but as a woman folding jeans on a table the way you fold conversations you can\u2019t have anymore. Her hair had that half-gone look bleach gives when it refuses to flatter you. The scarf was green with little white flowers like punctuation.\n\nThere weren\u2019t trumpets. There was a carefulness. I said her name like it was a word I had checked the pronunciation of, and she looked up like a person who has learned to expect their name to be spoken when something needs doing. Her face did the computations you do when a stranger arrives carrying half of you in their eyes. She took a step and then a half-step back like the floor had changed levels and didn\u2019t warn her. I held the bag of biscuits too tight and then loosened my hands because my fingers are not responsible for other people\u2019s choices. We went outside because op shops are poor places to let a history unfold. On the street, we were two women with nothing to hide behind except a bin and the sky. She said, \u201cNia,\u201d and I said, \u201cYes,\u201d and that took the breath out of me more than anything else would have.\n\nShe told me she had left because she had thought it was kinder to stop trying when trying hurt. She told me there was a day she\u2019d stood outside a house and counted to ten a hundred times and gone home without knocking because she didn\u2019t have anything to put in the room that wouldn\u2019t stain. She told me she had lied about where she was so long her mouth had worn a groove, and she was trying to wear a new one now. She said my name again like she was learning how old I\u2019d become without the benefit of watching. I told her about Renee without giving away what wasn\u2019t mine to tell. I told her about Mrs. Healy and the tent and the market and the hall and the gulls. I didn\u2019t give her the small facts that would let her think she knew me without doing the work, like the way I sleep with one foot out of the duvet because it feels like a compromise. She told me she worked mornings and sometimes afternoons and always slept with the radio on. She did not promise me anything and I did not ask.\n\nI gave her the biscuits because my hands needed to do something that wasn\u2019t tuck a child into bed years too late. She laughed when she saw them because they were Milo and she had a story about leaving a boy with a mug and a spoon and a warning about ants and coming back to find him sleeping on his arm at the table with a moustache that would not wipe away. Then the laugh and the story turned back into the air, where they came from. She had a room, she said, off Ponsonby Road, a place you can hear other people\u2019s lives through a wall, and it kept her honest. She asked if this was where I wanted to stop or start, and I said I didn\u2019t know, which was true. We agreed to pick a day and an hour and not to give it too much shape. On the way home, I spoke to the wind, because it would not tell anyone, and told it that I had done the brave thing without knowing if I would get a reward. It told me, in that way that weather talks, that the reward is a different question.\n\nThe next weeks bled like a nose you forgot to tilt your head forward for. We met once in a caf\u00e9 where the seats were bolted down as if someone had tried to leave with a bench before. We drank tea and talked around the edges. She had my eyelashes and a way of not finishing a sentence that made me want to pick it up and put it back in her mouth, which I didn\u2019t, because I am not a surgeon and the wound didn\u2019t belong to me. She told me a story about the time she had saved a cake by pretending she always meant for it to be a trifle. I told her I make curd like it\u2019s a way to smuggle summer into winter. We parted like colleagues at the end of a shift, polite without being false. I went home and made marmalade until my kitchen looked like a science experiment, and when it set, I wrote her name on a jar and put it at the back of the cupboard and told myself she would ask for it one day and also that she might not.\n\nIn the middle of all that, life kept insisting on itself rudely. Kahu defended his thesis on a Wednesday morning with a fever that would have made a wiser man reschedule. He wore a shirt I recognized from a party we\u2019d gone to where the chips had been stingy and people had been stingier. He stood in a room with bad carpet and explained the price of water and the ways it gets into a body and the language we use to pretend we don\u2019t know who it belongs to, and he did not once use the word journey even when they gave him an opening the size of a paddock. He came out with a look on his face like he had been holding up a roof and now someone else had finally got a hand under it. We went straight from the university to the market and made the kind of scones that get confused for communion, and he told everyone who would listen that the planet had not been saved by his document and that was not the point.\n\nMrs. Kline had a fall on a Thursday, the kind that looks small until the next morning. She left me a note under my door in handwriting that wobbled but made it across the page like a determined canoe. It said, in the way a general might tell you to fix your hair, that she\u2019d had a disagreement with the rug and the rug had won and could I please go to the dairy and tell Mr. Singh to let her pay him later for the eggs because she did not intend to stop making pancakes at her age just to please time. I went up. Beethoven blinked at me with the disdain of a creature who has never fallen, then put his paw on my knee as if to remind me of my role on this earth. We made pancakes together, the kind with too much baking soda because she insists it keeps you upright, and she told me about a girl who\u2019d come to her door at midnight seven years ago crying and how she\u2019d made that girl sit down and eat toast and then washed the girl\u2019s hair like it was a spell. It was new information and old. She told me she had written to a cousin in Napier who once knew how to find a man in a pub in Tauranga, because that\u2019s how you find people in this country, and did I want her to put out the word or was that me taking too much in both hands. I said to put out the word. She nodded and said, \u201cGood girl,\u201d and the words landed on my bones like a blanket.\n\nSila took to Back Steps like she\u2019d been waiting to be told where to put the trays. She organized the Esky with the ruthless thoughtfulness of someone who had raised three children and one teenager who wasn\u2019t hers on a budget that would make anyone else mean. She told me I didn\u2019t charge enough for the tartlets and I told her to stop being my father, and she looked at me like I had revealed more than I meant to and then told me I was doing the math wrong and I knew that she was right so I printed new cards with numbers that made me feel like a thief and then remembered that paying rent does not make you a villain. Sila brought her sister one Saturday, a nurse with hands that could hypnotize a child, and between them they moved the queue so gracefully people thought they were dancing and put money in the jar.\n\nWind found us again the day we were invited to set up on a corner of the farmers\u2019 market where the fancy stalls were. The vendor who sold very good salt with words on the packet came over and introduced herself without a single insult, which made me suspicious. We had just got the gazebo to stop behaving like a kite when the sky changed clothes. The stall ropes sang like people who don\u2019t know the words and the air moved through the vines like gossip. The wind took the chalkboard and sent it three stalls down. Jules chased it and came back with it under their arm, hair in their eyes, yelling that the wind had asked for a discount and they had told it to get bent. We held the tent down with everything that wasn\u2019t nailed to the soil. The beekeeper showed up with more weights because apparently he lives for bad weather. A teenage boy from the stall that sells apples put his shoulders under one leg of our gazebo and stood there for seven minutes and never mentioned it later, which is how you know someone has been raised to think being useful is a language.\n\nAfter the storm, the air felt like a drunk who had decided to apologize. The customers came back in that way where they pretend they weren\u2019t waiting across the road calculating the risk of damp coconut. We sold out of shortbread because everyone in a five-kilometre radius had decided they were owed sugar for surviving. I put a pair of lamingtons aside because a boy had come early with exact change and asked me to save them, and when he came back three hours later with a bandage on his knee and a look like he\u2019d lost a race with a kerb, I handed them over as if we had planned this together. He told me he had stood in the rain because lamingtons taste better if your socks are wet, and I told him I would put that on a T-shirt and he said to make sure I credited him, and we shook on it.\n\nThe television people called about a segment on small businesses with not enough money and too much heart. I told them to bring their own extension cord. Poppy came along with a lanyard even though we weren\u2019t on her show anymore because she had caught the disease and couldn\u2019t stop being helpful. She pointed their cameras at Sila, at the Esky, at the jar by the door that said Give if you can, Take if you need, and a microphone at my mouth that tried to make me say things I didn\u2019t mean. I talked about butter and grief and why toast is sometimes the only dinner that does the job, and then they filmed a slow shot of honey dripping off a spoon as if it were a metaphor and I tried not to roll my eyes. When I got home, there was a message from a woman in Balclutha with a photo of her kitchen and a paragraph about her mother\u2019s hands and the way her mother had taught her to count in a language the radio never used. She had never thought to put feijoa in curd, she said. She had always thought it would taste like an argument. She tried it and said it tasted like her auntie telling her to be brave and not look foolish. I wrote back and told her that was sometimes the same thing.\n\nOn a Sunday, I went to the hall in Whakat\u0101ne because I had promised and because promises are a kind of axle. Renee was there with the oven that has opinions and a class that had signed up because word had gotten around that we were rude about fondant. There were four aunties at the bench with the competence of women who have fed boats and funerals, and a boy with a breathless look who wanted to fold pain into pastry and didn\u2019t say that aloud. We made a pie that didn\u2019t leak and a biscuit that did, and we decided the tidy thing was not always the goal. An old man came to the door with a cardboard tray of oranges from a tree that had forgiven him, and he put it down and said, \u201cFor the girls,\u201d and I didn\u2019t correct him. After, I sat on the steps out back with Renee and told her about my mother like I was describing weather. She put her hand on the back of my neck and squeezed once like a mechanic testing a bolt. She said, \u201cIf she comes, let her sit. You know how. If she goes, let her go. You know how,\u201d and then she told me about a woman named Tia who had taken a bus to Gisborne and met a man at a fish and chip shop and decided, over battered tarakihi, to stay one more day, and the next, and then two decades later to come home and teach a class on how not to waste your life pretending fat is a sin.\n\nThat week, the woman with the shaved head came back for more tartlets. This time she brought her mother, whose head still had hair, and they stood together in front of the table and told me that taste had returned like a memory out of order. They bought scones and then sat on the curb because the benches were full and ate in a silence that was not grim. When they left, the mother squeezed my fingers and told me I\u2019d done a kindness no doctor had managed, and I thought she overestimated me wildly and decided not to correct her because sugar can do better things when it\u2019s not interrupted.\n\nWe had a night in the hall where we tried to make kouign-amann because sometimes you need to look God in the eye. We drew butter into flour and the room smelled like a church for people who love a challenge. The first tray was a crime, and we ate it to hide the evidence. The second tray sang the right note, and the room made that small moan people do when dopamine knows it has a role. Jules leaned on the counter in the afterwards and said, \u201cDo we remember how to be small?\u201d and I said, \u201cWe are already small,\u201d and they said, \u201cNot like that,\u201d and I said, \u201cAsk me again when my mother sings to me or doesn\u2019t,\u201d and they nodded like I had told them the weather report for the kind of day that has both beach and windscreen wipers.\n\nThe day of the meeting I did not call a meeting, I put on a clean T-shirt and a jumper without sugar welded to it and wore my hair down because I wanted to look like a person who had made choices and not just been chosen by the kitchen. We met at a laundromat because the caf\u00e9 felt like too much and the park felt like a trick. The washing machines made their fluent arguments, and the smell of detergent did its best to tidy what it could. She came in with a plastic bag of clothes she didn\u2019t put down. She looked better than the first time, which is to say she looked like she had slept a little and had not argued with the mirror. We put coins in machines and watched fabric try to forgive sins. She asked me if I wanted to know the names of men who had tried to be father enough for a day. I said no because I couldn\u2019t keep them and she nodded like I\u2019d passed a test she hadn\u2019t meant to set. She told me about a job she had for a few months where she washed sheets in a hotel and the way she learned not to imagine the lives that had happened in them because she would drown. I told her about the hospice without saying the word dying and she understood without needing me to be brave.\n\nWhen the spin cycle hit that part where it feels like the world is going to leave the bench, she said, \u201cI am not good,\u201d and I said, \u201cNeither am I,\u201d and then we both corrected ourselves, because \u201cgood\u201d is a word that has been used against us for too long. She said, \u201cI am trying,\u201d and I said, \u201cMe too,\u201d which felt like giving each other a handshake in a dark room. When we parted, she touched my arm the way you touch a cat you don\u2019t know yet, light, and asked if I would send a photo of my stall because she wanted to see the sign. I sent it on the way home. She replied with a picture of a plate with three scones on it that were not mine and a caption that just said, Second try, and I sat in the car with the engine off and cried for four minutes with the clean grief of someone who has been waiting for a sentence exactly that length.\n\nPaperwork began to wear me out in new ways. The grant for the classes needed four references and a budget that made sense even in daylight. Poppy wrote one like a person used to being generous with stationery. The nurse from the hall wrote one that made me blush in the kitchen when I read it alone. Tasi wrote one that spoke about me as if I were an engine that could be tuned and he was profoundly impressed by the torque. The fourth came from the school in \u014ctara and it said, without weeping, that the scones had been soft and so had the way I had spoken to the kids and that these are related, which is the sort of sentence that should be allowed to be stapled to your person as a charm. I sent the packet off with a breath and a joke in the subject line because sometimes you can bribe the universe with tone.\n\nA woman named Lani came to the stall and asked if she could bring her Twins\u2014capital T\u2014to a class. She said it with the delicate smile of someone who has fielded too many jokes about twins and is not here for your comedy. The boys turned up with haircuts that had been negotiated and the carefulness of kids who have been told they are a handful and have decided to become one. We set them up at the end of the bench and I gave them the job of zesting lemons because it involves knives and adults are cowards. They zested with the concentration of surgeons and the kindness of people who split the good part of a biscuit without being asked. On the way out, one of them put fifty cents in the jar and the other took a fifty-cent piece out. Lani pretended not to see and then asked me on the phone later if that was stealing and I said it was balance and she said she had been raised strict and I said to raise them kind.\n\nSila got a call about her sister\u2019s baby and left a trail of tea towels and promises. She came back with photos that made us all fall over with the right kind of envy. We sent a box of scones and a jar of curd to a hospital ward where a new life had entered a room that smelled like sanitizer and sweat and someone swearing love through their teeth. In the group chat for the hall classes, a woman sent a picture of her first pie that didn\u2019t slump, and we all told her she was a god. The boy with the skateboard turned up with his mother, who bought a tart as if rewarding him for not getting detention, and then told me quietly she had been learning to bake from YouTube because sometimes talking to a person was too much, and I told her to come to class and stand at the back and leave if it was loud and she said she had been hoping I would tell her that.\n\nOn the day the grant email arrived, I was in the car outside the wholesaler calculating the per-scone cost of cream like I was being paid to do math. The subject line had the name of the council and then the word Congratulations, which should come with a medical warning. I read it twice and then out loud to the steering wheel, and then I sent a message to Renee which was only exclamation points and a lemon, and she replied with a photo of her hands and the elbow scar and a loaf of bread she had decided to teach the girls on Saturday because now we could afford more flour. I drove home with butter in the boot and hope on the passenger seat and got a parking ticket I refused to hate because sometimes you have to let the city take a coin out of your pocket and call it a tax for being alive.\n\nThat night, the community centre hall filled with people who had smelled something happen. We put a sign on the door that said FREE BISCUITS, FUNDING JOY, and the room did the thing where it grows another wall to make room. The knitting ladies came with their elbows and their opinions. The school teacher brought the boy who had accused me of treason against jam. The aunties from Whakat\u0101ne arrived with a plastic container of fried bread like a bribe. The beekeeper turned up with a jar labelled most polite this season. The health inspector came in civvies and refused to talk about hygiene more than once and then ate a lamington like she had been practicing not to for a month. Jules stood by the urn and poured tea with a flourish that made people put money in the jar even though it was a free biscuits night.\n\nI told them the grant had come through and that we could pay the hall without me having to decide whether butter or electricity mattered more. I told them we were going to run a class on Tuesdays for anyone who had ever been told off for making crumbs, and that the rule would be that if one person came we would teach one person and if thirty came we would teach thirty and if no one came we would sit in the kitchen and make biscuits for the Thursday drop-offs. People clapped and then began to mill around like molecules learning a new structure. Mrs. Kline sat in a chair near the door so she could direct traffic, Beethoven in his harness like a prisoner who had charmed his guard. Bo came in late with the kind of entrance you make when you know the room will make a space for you and told me she had written down the name of a woman who might tell me something I hadn\u2019t asked the right question for. I took the paper and put it between my fingers the way you do with a wafer at a church you attend sometimes.\n\nWhen the night was ebbing and the dishes were piled in a way that would make tomorrow yell my name, I went outside to the back steps, where the air knows you. The city had chosen to be quiet, which happens so rarely you should sit when it does. The gull on the fencepost had three feathers out of order and did not care. I thought about the tiny seam between acts of love and acts of labour. I thought about my mother\u2019s second-try scones and the way I had not yet decided if I would bring her a jar of curd or make her ask. I thought about Mrs. Healy and the way Coco\u2019s voice had held me in the doorway of that room, and about the way the hospice had loaned us a projector like it was the most normal thing. I thought about the boy with the exact change and the girl with the bitten nails and the twins who didn\u2019t steal, they balanced, and about how every room I had stood in had taught me to count chairs until I could stop.\n\nInside, someone yelled my name in a tone that meant there was either an emergency or a cake that had turned out prettier than expected. I stood up, felt a pull in the back of my calf that told me I was human and not built entirely from stubbornness, and went in. The next morning there would be a meeting with a woman at a bank who would speak to me like I was a ship in shallow water and offer me a loan with teeth. There would be a letter to write to a boy in Dunedin who wanted to know how to bake without waking his father. There would be a shopping list for butter and lemons and the green cord that goes on the gazebo that always disappears, and a call to Tasi to ask if the new sound Cherry was making was a joke or a threat. There would be all the small practical magic that keeps a life from coming apart at its seams. For now, the room put its hand on my back and moved me where I needed to be. For now, the biscuits cooled. For now, the gull shrieked two notes that didn\u2019t sound like my name and I decided I didn\u2019t mind.",
