     "novel_text": "Before the first light smudged the edges of the coast, Alec was already out among the sheep with a thermos of cheap coffee and a fleece he\u2019d pulled from the nail in the tack room. Fog lay in folds over the mid-slope, as if the hills had thrown blankets up to their chins and were pretending to sleep. He rubbed his hands together, breath pluming, and listened to the invisible Pacific pounding somewhere beyond the eucalyptus and the pale rise of grass. The smell of salt drifted inland on a slow wind, furled with the ammoniacal sweetness of the flock and the mineral damp of dew. He spoke softly into it all, to the dog, to the wary ewes and lambs, to himself.\n\n\"Easy,\" he said, though nothing was happening. \"We got time.\"\n\nHe\u2019d never thought he\u2019d end up shepherding. That was a story for people with a family tract and a bible of irrigations, not a boy who\u2019d left San Luis at nineteen to forget one thing after another. Yet here he was, on a leased patch outside Cayucos, where grass grew brittle in summer and washed back into luminous green by January, and where the year buckled itself around the tides and the market price per head. He had a decent eye for sick animals and a better hand with fences. The rest he\u2019d learned by listening to old men at the auction yard, by making mistakes and then quietly doing something harder the morning after.\n\nThe dog\u2019s name was Madrone, a rust-bellied mix with a solemn intelligence, and she ghosted at his heel until he sent her wide. \"Keep \u2019em tight, Mo.\" She swung like a hinge, and the sheep drew together with the reluctance of sleepy schoolchildren.\n\nWhen the sun finally nudged up, it cut through the fog and made it luminous, layers of milk and gold. The fence line along the eastern boundary ran down toward a dry arroyo and then back up toward his house, a low-slung barn swallow of a building that had once been a shack for pickers. Before he\u2019d leased, a realtor had shown him listings with ocean views and banked decks, all the predictable glass. He\u2019d said no, feeling strange even as he said it. He wanted this: the smell of dirt that had been turned over, a roof that could peel back shingle by shingle until he relearned weather.\n\nBelow the house, an acre or so of ground lay stubborn and matted with fennel and bristly ox-tongue, a piece he\u2019d promised himself he\u2019d fix \"next week\" for three months. He imagined rows of brassicas, a little pocket of kitchen herbs, whatever didn\u2019t roll over and die when the north wind got personal. But his hands always ended up with hay twine in them instead of seeds. He had an agreement with the landowner to tend the old apple trees along the driveway too, which had suffered from someone\u2019s bright idea to let the grass grow tall around them. He\u2019d meant to learn about pruning angles and was instead learning how to drink coffee at one in the morning without noticing it.\n\nHe finished the pass along the low pasture and stood with his palm on the fence post, feeling the vibration of Madrone\u2019s body as the dog pressed against him for praise. The road was still except for a single pickup moving slow as a prayer, and beyond it the ocean, a flat bruise.\n\nBy eight the fog had climbed to a high ceiling and turned thin. He was in the lower garden with a borrowed spade, cutting along the border to see if he could coax it into a shape that didn\u2019t look like a crime scene. His phone buzzed in his pocket and he ignored it, thinking it might be a feed delivery, or his vet, or someone selling something. It stopped. Started again. Stopped.\n\nA voice carried down the drive, unexpectedly close. \"You Alec?\"\n\nHe looked up, blinking, and the woman on the other side of the fence raised her hat in lieu of a handshake. She had the kind of hat people wore in old pictures: straw, frayed, a blood-orange ribbon threaded through the crown. Her hair was tucked under it, but a wing of it had come loose at her temple. Her jeans were scuffed, her shirt was printed with lemons that had faded to ghost-citrus. She was not young-but-old, or old-but-young; she had that look people who\u2019ve worked outside get, as if the air had carved them a little.\n\n\"I am,\" he said, pushing the spade into the soil with the side of his boot. \"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" she said. \"I\u2019m Marin.\"\n\n\"Like the county?\"\n\n\"Like the sea.\" She rested her forearms on the top rail, making the boards creak. The air around her smelled like wet rosemary and wood smoke, and he realized she\u2019d carried it with her, not the morning carrying it for her. \"I heard you were looking. For someone to smack your weeds around. A gardener.\" She said the last word in a different tone, half teasing, as if it were something you bought at a roadside stand.\n\nHe wiped his hand on his jeans and offered it, and she took it without flinching. \"I am,\" he admitted. \"Or I was, and then I started to believe maybe the weeds were winning and that this was their land anyway.\"\n\n\"They do that,\" she said. \"It makes them happy, you know, the lying down in mass graves.\" She pointed with her chin at the fennel and the burrs and the scutch grass that had thrummed up overnight, or so it seemed. \"This is honest soil. It just wants you to understand what it\u2019s capable of.\"\n\nThat made him smile, despite himself. \"How\u2019d you hear?\"\n\n\"Maya, at South Bay Nurseries. I worked there a while, through winter. She said you were the shepherd with a soft spot for apples and a sore back.\"\n\n\"Maya,\" he said, with an involuntary fondness. She\u2019d given him two ragged flats of kale like a blessing and told him the secret to avocados was not to try to raise them in an argument with the wind. \"I do have a sore back.\"\n\n\"Let me walk it,\" Marin said. \"I don\u2019t do chemicals. I get mad at Roundup like it did something to me personally. I do hand weeding, sheet mulching, tricks, conversation, sometimes music if the dirt wants it. I like being paid in cash, we can be grown-ups about it. I work Wednesdays elsewhere and I\u2019m at the harbor on Fridays, so Mondays and Thursdays for you if you like me. I have references. I saw your apples, by the way; the short answer is, those need a day and a ladder and someone unafraid of metaphor. The long answer is, oh boy.\"\n\n\"The harbor,\" he said. \"You sail?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\" She shrugged. \"I like looking at lines. I help with a little boat that needs always fixing. Don\u2019t look at me like that. It\u2019s almost; it\u2019s almost not stupid.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of the ocean,\" he said, though he\u2019d been thinking of her mouth when she said almost, the way certain words tilted the corners of her lips. He was not a man who studied mouths.\n\n\"Well, that too. It\u2019s big. Sometimes it\u2019s blue. I\u2019m Marin, like I said. You are\u2026 what did Maya say\u2026 Alec-of-the-hills.\"\n\n\"She did not say that,\" he said, alarmed.\n\n\"She did,\" Marin reported, delighted. \"In her inside voice. Listen. Pay me sixty-five an hour. Pay me seventy when it\u2019s trees because I don\u2019t like arguing with ladders. I\u2019ll bring a truck and tools, because yours look like they have feelings and I don\u2019t want to hurt them.\"\n\n\"You didn\u2019t ask me if I was going to hire you.\"\n\n\"That would be assuming no,\" she said. \"And I don\u2019t like living in futures that don\u2019t want me.\" Then her face went a little softer, the joke taking its coat off. \"I need work, and I like land that\u2019s been looked at honestly. You didn\u2019t put in fake lawn. You didn\u2019t call it a lawn ironically and then it turns out to be fake-corn in spring and fake-snow in winter. You put fence up yourself; see how this nail bends. You care. So I want to work here. I want to get dirt under my nails and say hello to the dog and not get yelled at for drinking water on the job.\"\n\n\"Pay at the end of the day,\" he said, as if he were laying a board on firm supports. \"Cash is fine. I should probably look at references. Not because. You know. But because.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Write this number down. There\u2019s a woman named Esperanza, over in Los Osos. I took a yard of oxalis and made it cry, she\u2019ll tell you. There\u2019s also a guy named Wyatt who thinks I\u2019m a witch. He\u2019ll tell you that too. It\u2019s because I talk to his squash.\"\n\n\"I talk to my sheep,\" he said. \"We\u2019ll get along.\"\n\nShe cut him a look then, one of those starboard-tilting looks, amused and measuring, and then she took her hat off and wiped her forehead with the back of her wrist. Her hair came down a little. It was brown, and in it there was a streak of something like iron, or a mistake.\n\n\"Can you start now?\" he asked. He heard himself, the eagerness in it, and immediately wanted the ground to take him down a rung.\n\n\"I can,\" she said. \"Give me an hour, though. I left a trowel in my van and the van in Morro Bay, which is a long story involving a bird and a piece of toast.\" She tipped the hat back on. \"Tomorrow then? Seven? It\u2019s cooler. And I get to watch your dog take himself seriously.\"\n\nHe agreed to seven. After she\u2019d gone, the place felt like it had inhaled and then held it, waiting.\n\nHe spent the afternoon cutting thistle by the arroyo and hauled out three stumps he\u2019d promised the landowner he\u2019d deal with before last month\u2019s rent. He ate a sandwich over the sink, watching the ceiling fan stutter. The phone buzzed again. He looked: Evelyn. He swung his thumb over the accept button and then he didn\u2019t. He set the phone down, picked it up, took his breath like a drink and hit call.\n\n\"You finally alive?\" she said. He could hear her smile, the old one, the one she had used to soften everything from a traffic ticket to a too-brutal truth.\n\n\"Been alive all day,\" he said. \"How are you, Evie.\"\n\n\"You don't call me that,\" she said. It was automatic. Not unkind. They were in the tender place after a divorce where labels were suddenly knives handed to children. \"Sorry. You can. I have a thing I need. If you\u2019re willing.\"\n\n\"What kind of thing.\"\n\n\"Paperwork,\" she said. \"Dried hell. The registration for the Subaru, because you\u2019re still listed, and the DMV is what it is. If you could sign something without bleeding, I would be grateful. I can come up. I know the dog will roll over and pretend he\u2019s never met me, but I\u2019ll bring something stinky.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m here,\" he said. \"Tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"At\u2026?\"\n\n\"Seven,\" he said, and then he flinched. \"Seven-thirty? Eight? I\u2019ll be around. Early is okay.\"\n\n\"Alec,\" she said quietly, and he was suddenly terrified of what she might say next. But she went somewhere else. \"You\u2019re eating?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re not making Max eat beans out of a can.\"\n\n\"Max is a dog,\" he said. It was stupid, and they both laughed a little, the way once in a while the body laughs to show the heart what walking could be like. \"Come when you like. There\u2019ll be coffee. The cheap stuff.\"\n\n\"We drink cheap coffee now?\"\n\n\"I drink it at all hours,\" he said. \"The sheep don\u2019t care.\"\n\n\"Sheep never did care,\" she agreed, and then they fell silent in a way that was kind of a blessing. \"See you,\" she said, and hung up before either of them could do anything wrong.\n\nThat night, he lay awake on the couch, not because his bed was uncomfortable, but because the couch faced the window and the window was a rectangle of black that held in it the idea of the sea. Sometimes, late, he turned off every light and walked out to the fence line and listened to the whales when they came through, hearing them as rumors the water told the air. You could pick out something exquisite from the emptiness if you stood still long enough. He did not do that tonight. He stared at the shadow shapes until they softened and brightened, until dawn came and the dog nosed his knee and said in her useless, beautiful way, hey.\n\nHe had the kettle on when Marin\u2019s van pulled in, a white beater with a dangling mirror and a new tire. She jumped out as if she had been thrown by something glad. Madrone went to meet her as if they\u2019d been planning this reunion for weeks. In five minutes Marin had set up her tools along the fence: a fork, a long hoe, a coil of drip line like a sleeping snake, a bundle of cardboard cut into sheets.\n\n\"Today we\u2019re going to make your weeds think twice,\" she announced, rubbing her palms together as if she were about to install a heart in a whale. \"We\u2019re going to feed your soil. We\u2019re going to inflate your sense of possibility. Shall we.\"\n\nHe watched her work. You could learn a person by the way they moved one thing to make space for another. She knelt and pushed her hand under the mat of grass like someone reaching under a bed. She lifted it like a rug, laughing breathlessly when it gave, and the smell that came up was dark and mushroomy. She layered cardboard, soaked it, laid wood chips, adjusted the hose as if it were a living thing with preferences. She hummed under her breath. Not a song he recognized. Something made of three notes and a path between them.\n\n\"You should plant broad beans here,\" she said, pointing with her elbow. \"Let them do your heavy lifting. Let them flirt with the earth.\"\n\n\"Is that a phrase you can use,\" he asked, \"with beans.\"\n\n\"If I can talk to someone\u2019s squash, yes.\"\n\nAt eight-thirty, Evelyn\u2019s car came up the driveway, and Marin stood, shading her eyes, and Alec felt, in the slop of his chest, something like childhood panic. The old life meeting the new. The two parts of himself who did not share language except in the way bodies face each other, reluctantly, with honor.\n\nEvelyn got out with a manila folder and nothing else. She had cut her hair short since he\u2019d last seen her, and it made her neck look like something out of a painting. She wore a knitted sweater the color of over-steeped tea, and it made her skin look like something a person might take care of. She held herself in check until she saw Madrone, and then she crouched and the dog washed her hands with her tongue and whirled against her, thudding, whining in that way dogs have that sounds like a complaint and is not.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said, looking up at him, not getting up yet. \"You look like you\u2019ve been eating. Which is good.\"\n\n\"You look like someone who goes inside to make a phone call,\" he said, which was something she used to say to him when he had tested the limits of network coverage more than the limits of patience. He bent down too, rubbed the dog\u2019s neck, his hand bumping into hers and then not. \"This is Marin. She\u2019s\u2014\" He hesitated, aware of the oddness of the introduction. Boss? Worker? Another word, older than both of those, not appropriate in the place they were.\n\n\"Gardening,\" Marin supplied, standing and dusting her knees. \"I mean, staring at dirt and telling it stories until it agrees to still be dirt.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Evelyn said, straightening. \"I\u2019m Ev\u2014. I\u2019m Evelyn. Hi. This place\u2026 looks. It looks good. It really does.\" She was careful, and he was grateful. She handed him the folder. \"Sign where the tabs are. I brought each page because last time we guessed wrong.\"\n\nHe took the papers into the kitchen because the wind at the edge of the day was busy with them and they could turn the world into confetti in a minute. Evelyn followed, and Marin stayed out with the dog, bending a hose around her forearm like a lasso.\n\n\"Do you want coffee?\" he asked.\n\n\"I\u2019m a little jittery,\" she said. \"I had a dentist appointment and then I didn\u2019t go. Because I\u2019m a child. Sorry. You don\u2019t need to hear that.\" She leaned against the counter. \"I heard you lost a ewe last week. Maya told me. Sorry. Is that appropriate? I\u2019m sorry about you losing a sheep. This is not a greeting I ever imagined practicing, but here we are.\"\n\n\"It happens,\" he said, and the words were stones that fell cleanly without making a new dent in the earth. \"You learn to respect weakness without letting it run the show. You learn to watch.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I am trying to learn.\"\n\nHe signaled the line with a finger, and she heard the old language in it and handed him a pen without looking. He signed twice. She said thank you in a tone that was almost nothing, but that had in it a small room with a chair. A place to rest.\n\n\"Who\u2019s the gardener?\" she asked, after a minute. \"She\u2019s\u2026\"\n\n\"She\u2019s Marin. She knows everything about dirt. She has opinions about beans. She talks to squash. She works at the harbor on Fridays.\"\n\n\"The harbor.\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t start,\" he said, unexpectedly flushed. \"I don\u2019t mean. She\u2019s a person. I hired a person.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Evelyn said, her face perfect. \"You should. Hire as many people as you need. You\u2019ve always needed a crew. You think you\u2019re a lone cowboy because you watched movies on Saturday afternoons and then went for drives without telling anyone where you were going, but you need people. Just\u2014\" She stopped. Something like pain crossed her face, very fast, like a shadow of a fast bird. \"Just be careful with your heart, okay? It\u2019s made of the same stuff as everyone else\u2019s. Despite your theories.\"\n\n\"Hypothesis,\" he said, because he was a fool. \"It was a hypothesis.\"\n\nShe laughed despite herself, and the laugh did something to his insides that was both good and terrible. \"Sign the back too,\" she said. And then, more gently: \"She\u2019ll be good for the place. It looks, already. I don\u2019t know. Different. Like the land knows you\u2019re watching.\"\n\n\"You always say things like that.\"\n\n\"I happen to believe we are observed. By the things we own or think we own. And by the things we can\u2019t see.\" She held the pen for a second longer than was necessary before sliding it into her sweater pocket. \"Do you need anything? Money? No? You\u2019ll tell me, right?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he lied, and then didn\u2019t.\n\nThey went back outside. Marin had built a low wall of mulch and cardboard like an altar. She showed him the way to tuck the edges in. She showed him how the soil felt when you stopped fighting it. Evelyn stood by, her hands in her pockets, watching with the careful, deliberate interest of someone who had left and was still allowed to be here. It was awkward as rain on a wedding day. It was also exactly the right weather for what was happening.\n\n\"I should go,\" Evelyn said, when Marin stood and stretched and the dog flopped under the apple tree and became a long yellow line. \"It\u2019s a long drive and I forgot breakfast.\"\n\n\"Do you want a peach?\" Marin asked. \"I have a peach. It\u2019s not good. It\u2019s a little mealy. It\u2019s honest about it, though. You can have it anyway.\"\n\n\"I have this thing about peaches,\" Evelyn said, smiling. \"They taste like promises. I break promises with my teeth. Thank you but no.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" Marin said, and took a bite that left her with juice on her chin. She wiped it with the back of her hand and looked like a child for exactly a second. She turned to the tree and said, with complete seriousness, \"Paper around your trunk. You\u2019ll feel better.\"\n\n\"She talks to trees,\" Evelyn whispered, as if this required him to be at risk, and Alec felt a surprising anger rise, then pass.\n\n\"She listens to them too,\" he whispered back.\n\nThey said goodbye in the driveway in increments. Evelyn put her hand out to shake Marin\u2019s and Marin held it with both of hers like she was reading something through skin.\n\n\"If you need help with anything green at your place, I do community rates for ex-wives and nieces and people who have thin dogs,\" Marin said. \"I like making things more livable. It\u2019s my fatal flaw, besides rocks.\"\n\n\"I live in a small apartment with a basil plant that hates me,\" Evelyn confessed. \"If I hire you, it will be to talk to it so it stops singing my failures back to me.\"\n\n\"Ah, basil,\" Marin said gravely. \"The most judgmental herb.\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" Evelyn said, and they both laughed, and Alec had to put his hands in his pockets to keep himself from reaching out to both of them in different old and new ways. When Evelyn drove away, she rolled down her window and threw him a waiter\u2019s wave, a flick of two fingers off the steering wheel. He took it. He let it stick to him.\n\nHe turned back to the yard. Marin had peeled off her flannel and tied it around her waist. There was a tattoo on her forearm he hadn\u2019t noticed: a small boat, almost a child\u2019s drawing, nothing dramatic\u2014but it had ropes and a little mast and a black edge to its hull like a promise. The word under it was almost unreadable. He squinted. Not a name. Two words.\n\nShe caught him looking. \"It\u2019s fine,\" she said. \"People can look. It\u2019s only a story I wrote once and then had to put somewhere.\"\n\n\"What does it say.\"\n\n\"It says \u2018stay small\u2019.\"\n\n\"People always tell you to dream big.\"\n\n\"They do,\" she said, bending to fix the hose. \"And it breaks too many hands.\"\n\nThey worked until the sun was high and the fog had burned off and the sheep had moved into an area that had nothing left to recommend it. At noon he made sandwiches and they ate sitting on the low back step with their feet in the dirt. Without intending to, he asked her what brought her to the harbor.\n\n\"A boat,\" she said, through bread. \"A ketch with a soft deck and a loud engine that\u2019s in love with the attention it needs. Some of us are fixing her. Some of us only pretend to. The man who owns her says we\u2019ll see Mexico by winter. The sea says: we\u2019ll see about that.\" She drank water straight from the hose. \"I like working with what keeps trying to kill you. Very polite. Very true. Also I like the way rope feels when you coil it right. The way a knot, a good knot, remembers itself.\"\n\n\"You leave Fridays,\" he said. \"You come back.\"\n\n\"I come back,\" she said, and then her eyes did something: flickered away and back. \"I have some things in storage. I have a plant that needs me to say the names of its hallways. I have debts and a dog I don't have and a hunk of land now that is going to give me a stomach muscle. I have whatever this is. If I leave, I\u2019ll tell you. I won\u2019t let your apples wake up to a stranger.\"\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t asking,\" he said. He was.\n\n\"I know,\" she said. After a minute: \"You were married.\"\n\n\"I was.\"\n\n\"A long time?\"\n\n\"Long enough to make the hardest mistakes. Not long enough to fix them.\"\n\nShe nodded and ate slowly. She didn\u2019t tell him it would be different with her. She didn\u2019t say anything that made a promise where none could live. She said, \"Watch your step,\" when the dog rolled over into the path like a log.\n\nThe afternoon was a soft ache of work. They built an edge to the garden with scavenged bricks and a patience that felt like prayer. Marin taught him how to plant garlic by tucking each clove into the soil as if it were sleeping. She asked him the names of his sheep and he pretended he didn\u2019t name them and then said two anyway: Penny. Star.\n\n\"You are too sentimental for ranching,\" she said, gently.\n\n\"I\u2019m a shepherd,\" he corrected. \"Which means sentiment is my only tool besides fences and hope.\"\n\nAt three, a wind came up the canyon that was scented with wildfire even though there wasn\u2019t one, not that day. The summer before, smoke had made everything look like a bad dream. He looked at the hills the way you look at a sleeping baby with a fever. Marin looked too. She put her hand on his forearm without thinking, then took it away as if she\u2019d behaved badly.\n\n\"Sorry. I\u2014\"\n\n\"It\u2019s fine,\" he said. It was better than fine. It was a hand. It was a thing in the world that said you exist.\n\nShe turned away and picked up the fork and went on doing battle with the burdock. He watched her shoulders. He wanted to say something about the sea she liked, and the way it accrued all our leaving. He wanted to tell her about the night he\u2019d driven to Big Sur in a storm and slept in the cab of his truck, listening to rain like a riot on the roof, and how sometimes he still dreamed of that roof failing. He didn\u2019t say any of it. He told her instead to watch out for the sprinkler head over there by the rock. She said thank you. That was enough for then.\n\nBy evening, the rough lines of a garden had emerged: beds that logic could walk into, a path that didn\u2019t fight you. He paid her in cash and she counted it once and then tucked it into the front pocket of her jeans without ceremony. She took a plastic bag with some rosemary and a handful of figs. She leaned against the van and tilted her head.\n\n\"We did good,\" she said. \"Better than good. The dirt is less angry with us. Your apples are simmering down. And you, shepherd? You look like you slept while your body was awake.\"\n\n\"I feel like I\u2019ve been seen by\u2026 something,\" he said. \"An animal I want to know the name of.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s just work,\" she said, though her eyes were soft. \"It\u2019s the only god I got.\"\n\nShe left, and the air seemed to unbutton itself into evening. He poured dry food into Madrone\u2019s bowl and then stood at the sink and ate half a fig straight from the tree, the sweetness intrusive after a day of salt and dirt. The phone buzzed again. He looked. Unknown number. He let it ring out.\n\nLater, after he\u2019d made his one good thing\u2014black beans with garlic and some kind of pepper he\u2019d bought at the market because the man who\u2019d grown it had a story\u2014and after he\u2019d walked the fence line and once more admired the neat edges they\u2019d made, he sat on the porch with a beer and watched the sky lay down and tuck itself in. Stars came late on the coast when the fog stayed, and early when it didn\u2019t. Tonight they came one by one like someone arriving to a party with perfect timing.\n\nHe thought of Evelyn\u2019s face, and the way she had watched Marin with an amazement that had nothing to do with jealousy and everything to do with disbelief in her own continued ability to be surprised by other people. He thought of Marin\u2019s tattoo. Stay small. He thought of the sea beyond the ridge and the man who said Mexico by winter. He thought of knots remembering themselves. He had once believed love to be a knot like that. Maybe it was. Maybe you just had to give it slack and time and the right palm to run it through.\n\nHe fell asleep in the chair, his head tilted back, mouth open. He woke cold and went inside. He dreamed of fences becoming water and sheep swimming, their eyes like little planets, calm.\n\nIn the morning, the cardboard had started to drink the world. He knelt in the damp and pressed his hand flat on it the way you might put a palm to someone\u2019s forehead to check for fever. He felt heat, the heat of decomposition, and it delighted him in a way that felt childish, shameless.\n\nAround eleven, when the air was already a cupped hand of heat, a truck came up the drive too fast. He stood, alarmed, wiping dirt on his thigh. It wasn\u2019t a truck; he corrected himself. It was a boat of a car with a hood big enough to sleep on, the paint oxidized into a lizard skin of red and pale. The driver door opened with a sound, and a man stepped out with grey in his hair and a coat too heavy for the season. He had hands that had spent time on rope. He had the practiced squint of people who measure distances in waves.\n\n\"You Alec?\" the man asked. It was becoming the refrain of his week.\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m Owen,\" the man said. \"Friend of Marin. She thought maybe you\u2019d have a second for an old fool with a gasket problem.\"\n\nAlec blinked. \"On the\u2026 car?\"\n\n\"On the boat,\" the man said, pointing behind him, and only then did Alec see, cresting the hill like a wrong moon, the mast of a ketch strapped to a flatbed. It was ridiculous. It was also somehow right.\n\n\"We\u2019re bringing her over to a man with a shop who owes me two favors,\" Owen said. \"She didn\u2019t want to go without saying hello to the land that\u2019s paying for her varnish.\"\n\nAlec said something like, \"Ah,\" and then found English again. \"She can come say hello. I have no varnish but I have water.\"\n\nOwen grinned, and it made him younger. \"That will do. Marin told me you\u2019re the shepherd. That you listen.\"\n\n\"I try.\"\n\n\"Good. Boats need that.\"\n\nThey walked up to the flatbed and the boat, high out of water, seemed both proud and embarrassed, like a ballet dancer at the grocery store in costume. Alec put his hand on the hull without thinking and it was warm as a body. He felt, in his palm, the steady, patient courage of a thing built to move. He understood for a moment something he had never cared to understand about people who go away from shore on purpose.\n\n\"She\u2019s leaving in the fall,\" Owen said, as if this were the part of the conversation Alec had signed up for. \"God willing and the creek don\u2019t rise. We\u2019ll need hands. Marina tells me you\u2019ve got strong ones.\"\n\n\"Marin,\" Alec corrected, because the specificity mattered. \"I have sheep.\"\n\n\"So you do,\" Owen said. \"And sometimes the thing you tend tells you who you are. Sometimes it ate your mother, and you keep feeding it anyway. Come down to the harbor Friday. Just to look. You can put your hand on something that has failed and then fixed itself.\"\n\nAlec said he would, which meant he would go and he would stand with his hands in his pockets and stare at ropes and gulls and the ribs of boats and wonder what possessed him. The boat tilted slightly on the flatbed as if to nod to him. Owen got back in the big car and swung it\u2014gently now\u2014back toward the road. Madrone chased it for exactly ten yards and then sat down as if to say, okay, enough.\n\nHe texted Marin after, a message that said: Your boat came up to flirt with my hill. She sent back: She does that. Then: Friday. Come and I\u2019ll buy you a fish taco that will make you change your religion.\n\nHe typed: I don\u2019t have a religion. Then he didn\u2019t send it. He put the phone in his pocket and went to move the sheep to the upper pasture, where the grass was taller and the breeze was kinder. The dog moved easy. The sheep did what sheep do, which is to say, they defied prediction while obeying all the laws of sheep.\n\nHe went to bed early, sunburned on the nose and forearms. He slept and woke twice in that quick, hard way that feels like drowning though you know it isn\u2019t. He went to the kitchen for water, drank from the tap, and in the black window he saw himself and the small yellow kitchen and the ghost of a boat\u2019s mast like a twig against the sky of his memory. He touched his throat as if he had said something aloud.\n\nIn the morning, he met Marin at the gate. She lifted a bag of compost off her shoulder like it was a thing light enough to be reasonable. The dog danced. The sun was in the business of making a day. Somewhere down the hill, he could hear the long horn of a ship turning, sounding its body to other bodies.\n\n\"You look like you thought about boats,\" she said.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Did you think about seasick? Because that\u2019s fair.\"\n\n\"I thought about coiling rope,\" he said. \"And about how knots might help a person tell the truth.\"\n\nShe nodded as if this were not far-fetched. \"We tie ourselves on purpose so we don\u2019t fly away in wind. That\u2019s all.\"\n\nHe wanted to tell her he was already tied to a hill, to a dog, to an apple tree with scab he was trying to solve with sudden tenderness. He wanted to say he was not free, and that this made him happy in a way he didn\u2019t know how to trust. Instead he handed her the hose. She picked it up like an instrument, and the water made a music of its own.\n\nThe days passed then, the way days do when someone has arrived to stand with you inside them. They built and planted and watered together, and sometimes they didn\u2019t speak for an hour and it didn\u2019t matter. He went with her to the harbor on Friday and watched her climb a ladder to the boat with a fluidity that made him feel he had too many knees. He held lines when asked and tried to love the smell of diesel because she did. He ate a taco and almost changed his mind about god.\n\nEvelyn sent him a picture of the basil plant with a caption that said: still judging. He sent back a picture of a row of beans coming up like punctuation. She wrote: promises. He didn\u2019t argue.\n\nIn the third week of Marin working for him, the wind shifted and a fire fifty miles away decided to come their direction, not as flame but as ash. The sky went new. They put masks on and watered things they could not save and then stopped, because water had other jobs. The sheep stood watching with the particular boredom of prey animals who know panic is a currency you cannot spend all at once. Marin\u2019s eyes were flints, lighting without tinder, and he thought, briefly, that there are people made for all the different weather, and he had somehow found one who didn\u2019t laugh at the sky for being itself.\n\nBy the time the ash had settled and the news had moved on, a new thing had happened inside his chest. It didn\u2019t have a name. It wasn\u2019t love because love is a word we use for too many things. It was attention, paid without interest, with a kind of ritual. It was watching someone tie her hair up with a hemp string and wanting to be worthy of that string. He was not good at this. He had been married and been bad at this. He was trying to be better by being still and letting his face be readable.\n\nOne late afternoon, with the light slanting like someone had tilted the whole world, Marin sat on the fence and swung one boot. \"Do you ever think about leaving?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Leaving what.\"\n\n\"This,\" she said, gesturing at the hill, the dog, the sheep that looked like rocks until they moved and the rocks that looked like sheep until they didn\u2019t. \"The way you live inside of this geography. The loops. The mornings.\"\n\n\"Every day,\" he said. \"And then I think about the first thing the sheep do when I open the gate just right, and it\u2019s a thing that feels like music, and I don\u2019t go.\"\n\n\"I thought you might say that.\"\n\n\"And you,\" he said. \"Do you think about not leaving. At the end of fall.\"\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer for a long time. The silence put down a blanket. \"I have a debt,\" she said finally. \"To the boat, to the version of me that keeps getting smaller and is happier for it. There\u2019s something I need to meet out there. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be haunted by my own ankles, the way they itch. But I don\u2019t want to go like a thief. I don\u2019t want to go without planting garlic for someone.\"\n\n\"You\u2019ll tell me,\" he said. He meant: don\u2019t leave me like a weather change.\n\n\"I\u2019ll tell you,\" she said, and then she slid off the fence and into the work again, and the conversation went away like a tide that had come up to your knees but not higher.\n\nThe next morning, Evelyn called and did not bother with the usual mutter of apology that had grown between them like moss. \"I\u2019m on my way up,\" she said. \"Don\u2019t panic. I have a thing I need to bring you, and a thing I need to ask you to do if you can.\"\n\n\"You know you can always come,\" he said, and then wished he could take it back. The invitation was a rope that had to be thrown and then reeled in.\n\n\"I crashed my bike last night,\" she said, with a laugh that wasn\u2019t. \"Not like\u2014don\u2019t. I\u2019m okay. But the world spun at a weird speed for a while and my neighbor, Mrs. Patel, freaked out and now I have\u2026 alerts. I also have a business card of a neurology clinic that looks like a dentist, and I need you to come with me to be someone who hears things and can say what was said back to me. I know it\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s two o'clock in SLO. Can you. And can I leave the car at your place to remind me you\u2019re real.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, already lacing boots in his head. \"Leave the car, take me. I\u2019ll drive. It\u2019s a deal.\"\n\n\"You don\u2019t need to be kind,\" she said. \"But thank you.\"\n\nHe stood on the porch and waited for her. The fog had called in sick that day, and the sun was already showing its teeth. Marin arrived with a bag of seed and saw Evelyn\u2019s car already there and looked at him with something like a question and something like a resignation that belonged to older people. He wanted to say: I\u2019m not going backward. He wanted to say: I am still, always, the sum of my people. He said: \"I have to go to SLO with her. She hit her head.\"\n\nMarin\u2019s hand came half up between them and then down again. She said, thinly, \"Of course. Go. Don\u2019t worry about\u2014\"\n\n\"I\u2019ll pay you for the day, even if you have to leave.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not a contractor with a fragile heart,\" she said, and almost smiled. \"I\u2019m a person who can see your hands are shaking. Go be useful. I\u2019ll water the beans and pretend to be you. I\u2019ll talk to the sheep about music, they won\u2019t understand a word.\"\n\nHe laughed despite himself and the fear riding him. He put his hand on her shoulder as he went past, a little unsteady. She leaned in just enough to tell him she had noticed. Then he was in the passenger seat, and then the driver, because Evelyn insisted, and then they were on Highway 1, the ocean to their right blue like rumor, the radio playing nothing the way a good radio sometimes does. She kept touching her temple, and he kept wanting to pull over and hold her head and breathe for her as if he could.\n\nHe drove her to the clinic and sat with her in a room that smelled like lemon and old carpet and listened to a doctor with a voice like a kind bell. He wrote things down for her. He didn\u2019t say good when there was nothing good to be said, only probable and careful. He brought her a cup of water and made it seem like he did not need to watch her drink it. He walked her to the restroom and waited outside like a new father, stupid with love and terror that he told himself was only muscle memory. When it was done, when she was allowed to go and call someone tomorrow and sleep on her left side and not take stairs two at a time, he helped her into the car, and she said, out of nowhere, \"I\u2019m so angry at my brain for being the thing you touched today.\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t be,\" he said. \"It\u2019s the organ that brought you basil to fight with. It brought you every one of your words.\"\n\n\"It also brought me to you,\" she said, and then shook her head. \"That\u2019s not\u2014 I\u2019m not\u2014 I know what I\u2019m saying. Don\u2019t panic.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not,\" he said, and looked away at a stoplight that was ripening. He was panicking in a slow, organized way, like someone packing a bag for a trip he knew very well.\n\nHe took her home, or to what home meant now: a second-floor apartment in a building with a name that tried too hard, a view of a parking lot with a jacaranda in it that had decided to be a celebration despite the car alarms and the teenagers and the heat. He walked her up. He wrote down the phone number of the neighbor. He put a glass of water where she could reach it and made sure the basil plant had its little saucer filled like a tiny, dignified request met.\n\nWhen he drove back, the light was low and the trees along the creek were practicing being black. He pulled into the driveway and saw that the beans had twined twice around the string Marin had set and that the apple tree had paper at its base like a skirt. He found her behind the shed washing mud off her tools. She looked up, eyebrows askew.\n\n\"She okay?\" she asked, no ceremony of competitive feeling. Just asking.\n\n\"She will be,\" he said. \"I think. I hope.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Marin. \"Would you like to hear about your garlic? Or do you want to sit and let your heart take its boots off first.\"\n\nHe sat on the step and the dog put her head on his knee. Marin came over and sat near him and did not touch him and did not look at him and stayed in the same space as him until the sound in his chest returned to something he recognized. Then she said, \"The garlic is a genius,\" and they both laughed in the dusk, the way people laugh when they have found, for a minute, a ground that does not wobble.\n\nNight came again, and with it the old noises and new questions. He stood by the window, looking at the place the sea would be if the hill would sit down for a minute and let him see. He thought of the boat and the way the mast had looked like a pencil line against his morning. He thought of Marin\u2019s unarguable leaving, written somewhere already in careful, small script. He thought of Evelyn lying on her couch, one hand on her temple as if holding a roof on.\n\nHe did not yet know that everything he loved would align itself along a single day\u2019s axis later that year; that he would be asked to do something that even his stubbornness would call brave; that the way you save one person is sometimes a message delivered to another in a language made entirely of tide. For now he slept, and in the night a fox came and sat at the edge of the garden and watched the cardboard steam in its slow making of soil, its quiet beginning again.The morning after the fox, the garden wore a new grammar. Cardboard had softened as if someone had whispered to it all night, and when Alec pressed his hand to it he felt the sweet heat of undoing traveling into his palm. Madrone found the small prints by the compost and sneezed at them like old gossip. A row of broad beans, which yesterday had been only an idea under wet paper, had pried up their first hooks of green, pale and brave. He walked the fence line as the sun made a pale smear in the east and thought how newly alive the insult of fennel looked when you began to win against it. He could smell the ocean under the usual eucalyptus and sheep and rusted-wire tang of old nails, and for once the smell did not make him want to go anywhere, only to stand with the dog and feel a place claim him like a slow tide.\n\nMarin came with an armful of loppers and a ladder over one shoulder, the whole arrangement casual as laundry. She wore a plain shirt and the lemon one in a bundle, for later, because she said you either ended the day in a flannel or in the sun itself if you were doing trees. The hat was the same; the ribbon looked like a line someone had drawn between summer and fall. They went up the drive where the apples threw long patient shade and Marin leaned her cheek lightly to a tree the way you do with an animal you are about to set a hand on. She talked as she placed the ladder and clipped back the first watersprout, her voice full of practical myth. The tree is an animal pretending to be a fountain, she said. We are here to help it remember which way fruit is supposed to hang. The cuts were small and precise; she showed him the angle with her own forearm, the way a body makes a better tool when it remembers what it\u2019s built to do. He climbed behind her, feet careful on rungs, and she held the ladder with one hand and the story of his foolishness with the other until he did not feel foolish anymore. When a limb fell, fat with bad decisions, Madrone hauled it like a trophy and the two of them laughed because joy was not, strictly speaking, against any regulations.\n\nBy midmorning the trees looked less like a rumor and more like intentions. Marin had resin on her wrist that glinted like honey, and when she pulled the kerchief off to wipe her face he saw that the streak in her hair was not iron after all but something more like salt. She charged him the tree rate without blinking, and he handed her two extra bills in a way that tried to say both thank you and do not run your ladder alone on my account. She shrugged the thanks away like a burr and set herself to laying the paper around each trunk as if it were a blessing. He fetched the hose and stood back to watch the water sheet over cardboard and settle into a shimmer before disappearing. The smell that rose was like a remembered promise about rain.\n\nEvelyn texted a picture of a foam helmet and three question marks, and he called her and forced himself to make jokes first and inventory second. She sounded small and frustrated in the way smart people do when their bodies remind them they are mortal. He offered to bring soup and then laughed at himself, because when had he last made soup; she said she had learned to accept mercy without grading it and would take anything except cream of mushroom. Marin listened from the other side of the yard with her head down, the hose making its own valley along the mulch, and when he hung up she looked at him with one of her listening looks, the kind that asks nothing because it wants the answer to arrive from its own desire to be said. He told her the basics because there is a line between basic and betrayal and he was learning to stay on his side of it. Marin nodded and said that the brain is a sassy organ and then asked if basil had been watered, because this was how you cared for someone you had not met in the precise part of their life that was not your business.\n\nFriday at the harbor turned out to be a collage of metal sounds and shadows of gulls and old men in hats that were not jokes. The ketch sat against the pier like a tired queen and Owen stood on the deck with one hand on the shroud and the other gesturing toward a future you could not see if your eyes were too literal. Alec had never been good at ladders that were not touching earth, but he made himself climb because Marin did not ask him to. Up close the boat had a smell he had learned to name from a distance, the conversation between old salt and old oil. A young person with a welded ear cuff and a hammer introduced themself as Hana and handed him a coil of line without apology, as if the world already knew his palms and had a use for them. He held what he was given and watched how rope arced and fell when convinced with a flick of the wrist, admired a knot that sat down in itself and held, and thought of the dozen knots he had learned because sheep will find an exit you never even daydreamed. Owen had the kind of bad-tempered kindness that sailors wear like a ring, and his swearing about the engine was inventive enough to seem like poetry. He showed Alec the shape of the hull from beneath where it was up in a sling and told him the story of a reef off Santa Rosalia as if it were a relative, and Alec realized men become geography when they live with water long enough.\n\nThey ate tacos at a picnic table splintered with history, the hot sauce like an argument that ends well. Marin sat facing the water with her heel hooked on the bench in a way that made him feel he\u2019d never quite had a body until someone else sat in one near him. She had smears of something on her forearm that was either blood or paint; she licked a thumb and rubbed at it and it still didn\u2019t go which made her smile. She told him the boat\u2019s name as if she were telling him hers and it didn\u2019t sound foolish, only ordinary and proud. He didn\u2019t ask why stay small lived under a vessel christened to go elsewhere; he could see the logic in contradiction from here. When a boy in a sweatshirt too big came by to sell abalone shells polished by a cousin, Marin bought one for two dollars and said it was for the apples, which made no sense until she tucked it into the fork of a pruned limb later and the whole tree seemed to receive the joke.\n\nThe landowner showed up the following week in a car that looked like it had known romance in another decade and now just wanted decency. She was a woman with a braid like a cable and the look of someone for whom shock had been a bad use of time once and so she\u2019d stopped offering it to the world. Ruth, she said, and stood with one boot on a post and looked along the fence line in a way that made him straighten. They walked the orchard and he showed her the places apples had started to shape themselves into confessions. She told him about a cousin sniffing around with a developer\u2019s brochure and how she had told him to go pitch his tents in hell, but a niece had a way of liking glossy paper that made Ruth nervous in the nights when she listened to coyotes make their democratic noise. He felt the lease like a piece of paper in his shirt pocket that wanted a lamination he couldn\u2019t afford. She told him she liked the smell of the place again and that the old man down the hill had asked who\u2019d put their hand on the dirt and finally meant it. He offered her a fig and she took it and ate it half like medicine, half like a memory; when she left she thumped the side of his mailbox as if to make it ring true.\n\nThey had their first little emergency two days later and it did not kill anything, which felt like mercy. He found Penny on her side with distension that was too much like a balloon for his heart and he went that quiet that allowed the part of him with competence to put on its coat. He called Madrone to face what needed facing and sent for the trochar and stopped breathing long enough to make the small precise hole that lets ridiculous air become the world again. Marin was there because she had been placing bricks like syllables and when he said hold she held the ewe\u2019s head with a stillness that made her look carved. He did what he had learned from old men and mistakes and the dog had the wisdom to be a statue until it was good to play fool again. The sound the ewe made as she found a new angle against gravity was obscene and decent at once; Marin flinched and then breathed deliberately as if she were coaching her own lungs. Afterward they sat on the grass because sitting is what bodies ask for after you stab an animal out of love, and Marin said that she could do blood but not brains, which made him think of Evelyn and the way mercy takes shapes you don\u2019t choose. He rinsed the tool slow and careful and put it away clean because respect is a habit you build when you expect to need a thing again the next day.\n\nOn a Thursday they went to the DMV because there is always one government office and it is everywhere. Evelyn had set an appointment, which was a prayer in that building, and they took a number anyway which made them laugh, the number and the prayer holding hands like bored children. He had never seen his name look so capable of punctuation until it sat in triplicate under fluorescent light. They signed places that had been colored for them because color is how the state gets compassion onto paper. Evelyn wore her hair pulled back with something that might have been meant for one use only and now got two, and she had that look again that made her neck seem like a place someone had painted a sky. They sat with their shoulders not touching and their humor touching everything. When a woman at the counter said \u201csir\u201d in a way that had almost a lemon tart sweetness to it, he thought about the parts of himself that only came up when strangers asked everything too quickly. Outside, under a palm with the wrong idea about itself, they stood by her Subaru and said goodbye in a good grammar: she touched two fingers to her temple to prove she wasn\u2019t broken, he nodded in a way meant to say both go and stay. Marin drove past going the other direction with the bed of her truck full of straw and honked twice in a rhythm that felt like a secret handshake. Evelyn smiled without turning and said, \u201cYour witch has decent aim,\u201d and he said, \u201cShe\u2019s not mine,\u201d and it sounded like all the words people say when they are busy not saying the obvious.\n\nEvenings began to carry a weight he liked, the way bowls of fruit have weight when someone is coming over. Sometimes he and Marin ate together on the back step and sometimes he took his sandwich to the fence and pretended he had opinions a fence could use. She did not ask the kinds of questions that require confession for their entertainment; she asked what the wind had been like and he understood that meant she wanted the state of his self, not his secrets. She told him the story under her tattoo one night when the fog had been turned on low like a lamp and the dog had rolled herself into something the temperature could not discover. There had been a time, she said, when she had mistaken big for good and hunger for love; she had set out to become horizon and ended up mostly weather. She had stayed in rooms she should have left because music was playing, and she had left rooms she should have stayed in because music wasn\u2019t. A woman on a boat with hands steadier than God\u2019s had said try small, not as an insult, but as an accurate map, and Marin had taken a pen and written it on the inside of her wrist and then looked up while someone else needled it in. She did not tell him the names of anyone who had handed her either sorrow or salvation, which felt like proof of something you could trust.\n\nHe began to learn the currents of the harbor as if they were new paths for the dog. Friday mornings, Madrone watched him leave with a look that was almost complicated; he told himself she was composing an essay about how rope had claimed her person. He brought back to the hill words that did not originally belong to dirt\u2014tabernacle cleat, deadeye, jackline\u2014and put them down among sheet mulch and posts until they sounded like they had always lived there. He found a piece of nautical hardware in his pocket one night, grease black, dense as a threat, and set it on the windowsill like a shrine to all things that hold under strain. The apples started to blush and the garlic put up green that meant business. The beans found their way without asking for help and when he watched them he felt forgiveness for parts of himself he could not shepherd. Marin took a morning off to go to a dentist after months of saying the word like a hex and came back with a new gleam to her smile and three tiny black-and-white pictures of her teeth like moons, which she stuck under a magnet on his fridge for no reason beyond the fact she liked to put proof under cold things.\n\nAsh visited again for two days without the actual insult of flame. The light went to amber and the dog smelled like memory. He filled the stock tank twice and then went inside and did not turn on the news because there are only so many things you can make holy and information isn\u2019t one. Marin worked with a bandanna over her mouth and made jokes with her eyes only, and when she took the cloth down to drink she looked like the photographs of women at strikes he had seen on a calendar once, beautiful in the way that work makes a face plain and plain makes a face truer than hello. Owen showed up with Hana in a truck that did not believe in the concept of mufflers and asked to borrow the hose and left a bag of bolts that could have been coins in a more fortunate kingdom. Hana wandered to the fence with their hands in their pockets and whistled at the sheep in an accent entirely their own, and the ewes pretended not to notice because that is a sheep\u2019s spiritual practice. By afternoon the ash let go like someone who\u2019d remembered a different plan, and he went to the orchard and ran his finger along a leaf and thought of handwriting.\n\nThe first time he saw whales that year he did not tell anyone because he wanted a thing that felt like a secret that was all presence and no story. He walked out at midnight wrapped in old flannel and fog and sat on a half-rotted stump and heard the part of the world that holds everything else inhale. The sound came through the hill with a patience that made his own heart feel like an animal that might someday be trained by kindness. In the morning he told Marin anyway, unable not to, and her face changed to the seriousness that certain gifts demand. She said she had been out once on a friend's skiff when a grey had surfaced without any ceremony and looked like real estate, and how after that the idea of faith became less abstract. They stood by the gate and did not plan anything with that in mind; they simply had better reasons, which it turns out is how you leave a day less cruel than you found it.\n\nWyatt, who thought Marin was a witch, came up the drive one afternoon with the expression of a man whose garden had called him out. He held a zucchini under his arm like a baby he was trying not to admit he adored and asked if witches did house calls for afflicted squash. Marin took his case without offense and sent him home with a lesson on powdery mildew and the suggestion that he name the plant something embarrassing to increase their intimacy. Alec laughed and then wished he hadn\u2019t because Wyatt\u2019s dignity shone like a coin and he admired it. When they were alone again, Marin said that the only people she minded being accused of witchery by were the ones who did it as an excuse to withhold their own responsibility. She flicked a spider the size of a period off her shirt and went back to moving stones as if she\u2019d spoken to a committee.\n\nSummer remembered itself and then forgot and then remembered again. He sold four wethers for a price that made him stand the way a person stands to count what is still in his pockets after a movie with too many explosions. He sat on his kitchen floor and read a pamphlet about drought forgiveness for small agriculture that had been stapled crooked and made dignity miserable by accident. Ruth brought him a clipping about some county board meeting and he promised to go and then didn\u2019t and felt the smallness of that failure like a pebble in his boot and then went the following week instead and sat through two hours of men explaining math to women who had taught it. He spoke once, about fences and hope, and Marin later that night called his voice a tool he\u2019d been hiding behind a paint can, which made him want to buy a shelf for the things he meant to use more.\n\nOn a day with winds from the north that tried to make a quarrel of everything, Owen told him there would be a night test run and not to come unless he planned on either staying on land or seeing the inside of his own fragility. He went anyway, of course he did, because fragility is an animal you either meet or it meets you. They pushed off into a harbor that had decided to be a mixing bowl of black glass and breath. The boat moved like a horse that had been taught to wait until you meant it. He held to a rail he trusted and counted the steps between his dignity and his knees. Marin did not coo or encourage; she put his hand where it needed to go and said careful only when careful was an order from physics. Far out, beyond where the pier light made its small human halo, the water\u2019s rules changed in a way he had never asked to learn, and he learned anyway. He did not get sick. He did not become a sailor. He watched Marin grin into wind and thought of debt not as money but as promises you make to parts of yourself that were starving and you fed on purpose. Coming back in, the boat nosed past the working boats with their names like prayers to bills, and he thought not for the first time that he understood why people leave and why they come back and how sometimes it is the same reason wearing two different shirts.\n\nHe took Evelyn to her follow-up and they sat in another room with other lemon-scented air and a different doctor who said the same things with slightly rearranged commas. He spent an afternoon fixing her kitchen sink because it dripped in a way that made his shoulder ache by empathy and because he could, and because mercy that takes shape in wrenches is easier to accept at first than the kind that sits and stares at your face until you cry. She told him about a coworker who kept calling her Evie in an awful attempt to be part of the club of her, and he promised to come down to the bookstore and leer while buying three copies of an atlas to make a point. They did not touch except when the wrench slipped and she put her palm against his back to steady him and took it away before anyone could accuse that touch of anything. The basil had finally consented to behave and looked smug, and he told it so, and Evelyn laughed and said look at us, giving names and power to leaves.\n\nSeptember slid down the hills like something forgiving. The apples were light as hands on a face. The beans had made opinions about trellises irrelevant. He woke in the night sometimes with the surety that he had left a gate standing open, and went out in boots and pajamas to count, and found everything where it had promised itself it would be. Marin began to coil her words about leaving into smaller and smaller circles, the way you put rope away when it has earned rest. There was a list on her dashboard with boxes next to it: pharmacy, post office, oil change, Wyatt, Ruth, apples, beans, Owen, harbor gear, shoes, garlic, shepherd. He pretended not to see his name but he saw it and it both wounded and healed him because this is what being seen does if you are honest. She told him she would not go without a blessing from the dog, which seemed both ridiculous and like the only rule that mattered.\n\nOn a weeknight that decided to be a weekend early, Ruth hosted a small party that was not a party; people stood in her yard with cups and light on their shoulders and the sound of the ocean doing arithmetic behind the eucalyptus. Someone brought a fiddle that had been taught to make both joy and grief behave and played what it knew, and the old men from the auction yard became younger as they remembered steps they had sworn not to remember. Marin danced a little in place with her eyes closed and then stopped like she had been caught by something she had been trying not to love too much too soon. Evelyn came late, carrying a pie that had clearly argued with her and lost just enough to be perfect, and for an hour Alec stood in a geography of past and future that did not collapse but layered itself like geology. People he had chosen and people who had chosen him and people who had merely tolerated him all mixed until he could not tell which was which and did not need to. Owen told a story about a night off Punta Banda that made someone\u2019s aunt cross herself without remembering she did not do that anymore. Hana taught a kid who had never liked adults to tie a bowline around his own waist and be both caught and free at once. Ruth stood by a fence post and watched everything as if she were keeping weather.\n\nThe night after the not-party, the wind died like a toy that had been played with properly. Alec lay on the couch because the couch was where sleep came easiest now and because it faced the rectangle of window where everything that mattered seemed to practice arriving. He thought of all the pieces of rope in his life and the people who had put his hands on them; he thought of his own throat scarred inside by words he had said wrong and the way it still managed to carry water and coffee and breath without needing to let him know how it was doing it. He went to the door and stepped out and the air was clean in the way air is clean when its work for the day has been done and its result is not spectacular but no one has died. On the hill, something moved that was not a sheep and not a dog and not a person and he did not need to name it to know he should not alarm it. The garden breathed as a body breathes when it has learned that change is not always an assault; the cardboard was turning into soil where in a month he would kneel to pull a carrot that had done what no human had asked it to do. In the distance, down beyond what his eyes could hold, a horn sounded across water the way a message moves in a community: not for you alone, but for you too.\n\nHe did not know it yet, but by the time the apples were mostly a memory and the garlic heads were hung in braids like old wisdom, the day he had been warned about would walk up the drive as if it was asking for help with a map. He would stand with his palms open and accept and fail and accept again, and the saving would be a physics problem dressed as love. For now there was the smell of rosemary on his hands and the scrape of ladder feet that he had learned to set just so, and the dog sighing into sleep like a tide letting go of its own amazement. For now there was Marin\u2019s van turning into the driveway in the morning, the ribbon on her hat faded almost to a color the sky could only make by accident, and Evelyn\u2019s basil putting up a flower she would be told to pinch back and not and then call repentant over later. For now there was the ordinary holiness of work, and the way it made his body a house he might stay in without being lonely.Chapter 5\n\nThe hint of fall arrived the way all honest things do on that coast, by degrees and without an announcement you could put on the calendar. Nights stretched themselves over the shoulders of the hills and stayed there a little longer each morning. The apples took on their last colors with a seriousness that resembled modesty more than show. The harbor started to talk about windows, and how weather lets you out the door sometimes like a mother with her keys already in her hand and sometimes like a bouncer who wants to feel your bones for weapons. Owen\u2019s voice, on the days Alec went down to coil and learn, had a new edge that wasn\u2019t fear so much as arithmetic; he was measuring distances between wishes and facts. Marin began to do that thing with her lists where she stopped pretending they were for someone else to see. She crossed out an item about oil and wrote good rope and drew a box next to Ruth that she shaded in slowly over three separate mornings, as if shading were a way of saying thank you.\n\nThe wind shifted from the northwest to a dry chatter out of the inland canyons and every eucalyptus on the hill prepared its flammable gossip. Ruth came up in a truck whose bed had been taught what hay feels like and told him the county had muttered something about shutting the power when the gusts found their business hats. He filled stock tanks as if he were storing quiet. Marin walked the orchard with him and laid her palms against bark like someone speaking into an animal\u2019s better ear; they tucked more paper around the trunks because paper can be a prayer if you give it a job. Owen called from the harbor to say that a man named Shorty with hands like ropes had looked at the engine and said, in a voice like a spoon, that if they didn\u2019t go by the next Friday, they would go a month from now or not at all. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d Owen said, and it sounded both fine and like a cliff. Marin stood nearby with a coil of drip line over one shoulder and made a face that was almost a smile and then wasn\u2019t, and she didn\u2019t look at Alec because looking is a pressure you don\u2019t put on a thing that\u2019s already got a knot in it.\n\nThat night the whales came loud enough that the hill couldn\u2019t pretend not to hear. He went out and sat with his back against the cool of a post and let the sound move his ribs around like furniture. The fox came again and slid along the garden edge like a sentence he would someday be glad to have spoken; it paused by the cardboard that had turned sweet and looked toward the house with the indifference of royalty. Madrone lay down beside him with her head near his knee and sighed in a way that made him think of old men at the auction yard when a good price finally shook out of a stubborn afternoon. He had the thought, not for the first time, that if he stood very still, the land would tell him what it planned to ask. The answer was not words, but he knew it when it came: be ready to be still and to move both, and don\u2019t confuse one for an apology for the other.\n\nThe red flag warning went up on a Tuesday, and it was the kind of Tuesday that had forgotten it was not already August. The power snapped off around noon, indecorous, and did not do that coy thing where it comes back on to reassure you and then leaves you again; it meant it. The sky had that thin tin glare that makes everything you own look rude or too bright. Ruth asked if he would mind setting a line of sprinklers along the edge that faced the road because sometimes fire comes to the party you\u2019ve thrown for it, and sometimes it comes through the neighbor\u2019s yard. He minded only the way all people mind water when it has work and they would prefer it to be the kind of friend that just comes by to tell you a joke. He did it anyway. Marin was at the harbor wrapping the last brittle business of departure into duffels and plastic tubs and the kind of old coffee tins everyone thinks they threw away. She sent him a picture of a coil of three-strand laid down good enough to make a priest nod and he wrote back an obedient heart, which looked wrong on the screen until she sent a fish, which made the whole exchange human again.\n\nBy midafternoon the north had dropped a handkerchief none of them wanted to pick up. The far ridge put up a column the color of a bruise that had taken a class in theater. Ash traveled the way gossip does when someone is bored and mean. The ewes stood and did their slow calculus about heat and remembered water and the places on their bodies where flies would most like to have opinions. He ran the hose along the fence line and then turned it on his own neck because the body requests cool like it requests truth when it is out of it. Madrone brought the sheep in with that easy authority that made strangers forget how work is built on work and not on the cooperation of fate. Alec was not panicking on the surface; underneath, a patient animal was pacing, and he kept talking to it with words that did not require either of them to be wrong.\n\nHis phone buzzed with the old stubbornness of something that wants to be let in. There was a text from Evelyn that began with a name that wasn\u2019t his and ended with his, as if she had been trying on all the beginnings and none fit. The lines were short\u2014dizzy not the cute kind, can you be voice\u2014and then a sentence about the neighbor being gone and a cat who would not leave her shin alone. He felt his chest make that trapdoor motion that ends with your heart on the floor and then climbed down to pick it up and put it back where a heart belongs. He looked at the smoke and then at the flock and then at the dog and then he did the thing he had learned to do since he was nineteen, which is choose and hope choosing isn\u2019t the beginning of the explanation you\u2019ll have to keep offering to no one for years.\n\nHe called Marin because he knew the harbor was listening to other music and would be cruel if he asked it to hear his. She answered on the second ring with the sound of something metal arguing with another metal behind her and a voice that was breathless and intent and pointed at someone else until he said her name and then the point turned toward him. He told her the short version, and it was very short because he did not have time to decorate the truth. She said I can go in a way that did not sound like charity, only like the map her day could be folded into without tearing. He gave her the address and the apartment name that tried too hard, and something about a jacaranda tree that had decided to be a parade no matter how many Subarus wore dents beneath it. She said, \u201cI know the building. I know the jacaranda,\u201d and he believed her. He did not say please because he was at the mercy of enough things; she went anyway.\n\nOn the hill he cut the fence that was between him and a scrap of Ruth\u2019s lower paddock where the ground went naked and unremarkable, which is exactly what you want when you have animals that wear sweaters in a world full of sparks. He felt the burr of the wire through his gloves and it was a familiar small pain that made him grateful because he knew what to do with it. He whistled the way he whistles when his mouth isn\u2019t interested in being pretty. Madrone moved around the flock like a thought you keep having because it is right. They went through and down, the sound of their feet on dirt like dry beans in a metal bowl, and he closed the opening behind them with a crooked grace that would have made a true carpenter roll his eyes and a true shepherd nod. He used the bowline he had learned from Hana\u2019s hands on a Thursday when the harbor had been in a good mood, and the way it sat in itself did something to his breath. He ran lines from the old oak to the truck and then from the truck to the post because he had become someone who saw rope as both answer and question. When he tied off, he put his palm on the knot the way you touch a shoulder to say we\u2019re not done speaking, but you can rest.\n\nWyatt arrived with a plastic trash can that had become water for the hour and an expression on his face that announced he had no interest in the narrative but had brought what the narrative required. He said nothing helpful and everything helpful; he said, \u201cWhere,\u201d and then he put the water exactly where the hands would be if hands had time to be everywhere at once. Together they moved the last stubborn ewes that had found a reason to be offended by the angle of a shadow. The heat took a breath and then let it out in his face like a dare. The smoke did that thing where it makes a second sky out of the one you will have to miss later. He kept his brain on a short leash in the part of its yard where competence lived and told it to stay inside the fence.\n\nMarin\u2019s van made a noise like a promise going downhill, and she drove it not like a person with somewhere to be but like a person with something to deliver that should not be jostled. In the passenger seat, where a box of bolts or persimmons often rode, sat Evelyn with color in her face that did not belong there. The two women looked like soldiers in a small war that had not made the newspapers yet. Marin had one hand on the wheel and one on Evelyn\u2019s wrist not to measure a pulse but to hand one over if a loan would do any good. They had collected the basil out of superstition, and it sat between them judging everyone as was its right. Marin had said, with the very lightest tone, \u201cI am not your husband and you are not my boss, but I am a person who can say you are not allowed to apologize during the next forty minutes,\u201d and Evelyn had said, with more breath than voice, \u201cYou can say that,\u201d and that had been that. They slid into the clinic\u2019s lot and then into a space that someone was kind enough to leave with a hand motion that did not cost them, and the room inside still smelled like lemon and old carpet and authority you could trust.\n\nBack on the hill, it became the kind of midafternoon where time lies down like a dog and kicks its legs because the dream is too much for its body. The fire on the ridge became good television; it made shapes that meant something to the part of the brain that loves a story, and he refused it that comfort because comfort is for later and not for the parts of the day that need you to be accurate. He moved hose and soaked the mulch along the apple trees that had been given their paper skirts, and the steam that came up was like relief learning how to speak. He watered the cardboard because decomposition is a job too, and he would not let it be laid off. Madrone drank and then took a mud bath in exactly the place where he had just put his best work, which is how love makes sure you are still capable of forgiving. Wyatt stayed long enough to make refusing thanks rude, then left because men like him have arranged their lives so they can leave before anyone starts explaining why they came.\n\nHe did not check his phone for as long as you can reasonably refuse someone you love, and then he did check, and there were two messages. The first said checked in, and the second said scan okay, short watch, then rest, then soup? The question mark was aggressive and sweet. He realized his whole face had been doing battle with its own muscles and let it give in, which made his mouth feel like a small room you can finally sit down in. He wrote back with one hand while turning a valve with the other, telling her he had black beans and something to pretend at broth and that he had found tortillas that promised a talent they did not possess and made up for it with sincerity. He wrote to Marin a thank you that was unshowy and got back a picture of a vending machine that had refused a dollar three times and then accepted it as if it had been the machine\u2019s idea all along.\n\nBy late afternoon the wind\u2019s outline softened and the smoke behaved like a person who has remembered their manners. The power did not come back because power likes to make sure we remember who knows where the switches are. He took the dog to the upper edge of the paddock, and they stood looking at the line where wildland had almost decided to misbehave and then, for reasons none of them could take credit for, had not. He tried to let the part of him that hoards fear empty out through the toes of his boots. Ruth drove by slow and rolled down her window to show her face and the braid like a cable and the look of someone counting the cost of the last two hours in fence posts and invoices and sleep. He lifted a hand and she lifted hers, and they made the smaller kind of agreement that makes the larger kind possible.\n\nThe harbor had not been patient, which is not in a harbor\u2019s nature, and the things that could have gone wrong did not, except for one small part of the engine which behaved like an uncle who always tells the story about the time he almost did a brave thing. Owen swore and then made a joke about prayer that would have offended a different God than the one that lived in the business of work. Hana banged their head lightly against a winch and said they were courting wisdom. Marin came back around sunset with salt on her arms as if she had been dipped and set up to cure, and she drove directly to the hill as if there were nothing else a road could do but end where his fence began. She climbed out and leaned on the gate and looked at him with a face that said she had stored facts for him the way refrigerators store mercy. He set a pot on the stove and the flame made its earnest blue, and the beans behaved like beans do when you have told them a story about wanting them to be more than beans.\n\nHe did go down to the harbor after he had handed a bowl to a person who could taste appetite again. The sky between the hill and the water chose a peculiar purple that made him think of bruises with opinions. He stood on the pier with his hands in his jacket pockets because jackets were back in fashion by appointment with evening, and Owen pointed at a dozen things and used two dozen words that were new to Alec and three that were not and one that had nothing to do with the topic and was there for love. They cast off for a brief run, not for courage but to remind the boat that it could move without asking permission from the superstition that likes to gather around dry hulls. As they nosed past the end of the breakwater, the ocean made its simple, inscrutable face. He felt the boat underneath him the way you feel another person\u2019s breath when both of you are trying to pretend you\u2019re only sharing a bench, and he smiled because sometimes pretending has the same shape as faith.\n\nThere was a horn that night, because there\u2019s always a horn, and it sounded across the fat water like a message sent to anyone who had ears. He thought, stupidly and exactly, of his hill and of the tether he had put on the new gate and of the bowline\u2019s willingness to sit without complaint and be what it had promised. He thought of Evelyn on a couch under a lamp not designed for this, and the way her hand had insisted on being useful even when its person would have forgiven it for not. He thought of Marin\u2019s knuckles with resin stuck in their maps and the word under her boat tattoo that had rearranged the volatility of his days. He touched the rail because touching something keeps your body inside of itself when it is tempted to go flying.\n\nThey tied up again without insult or flourish, which is the only way to land if you ask anyone who has landed more than twice. Owen said the window was going to hold and then did the dance all men do when they are trying to predict a person they love who cannot be predicted; he smoked a cigarette that he had already told himself he hadn\u2019t, and then told Alec not to copy him. Hana handed Alec a coil and said, \u201cShow me,\u201d and Alec did, and when the rope lay down like a well-trained dog, Hana said, \u201cLook at you,\u201d in a way that made his ears hot and his hands feel like they belonged on the ends of his arms.\n\nThe power came back after midnight with the immodesty of something that gets paid no matter its performance. He woke to the hum like a pot of insects in another room and felt both grateful and amused by the ease with which a house returns to the illusion that it has always had nerves singing under its skin. He found his phone on the counter where it had slept out of courtesy and saw a message from Marin that said soup cured and a message from Evelyn that said basil judge recants and a picture of a plant with its one small flower pinched back and the stubbornness of life still written all over it. He stood at the sink with a glass and watched the water be water and thought about the simple honor of an element doing what it is.\n\nMorning after, the place had put on its clean shirt. The ash had settled into unhelpful corners. The towels on the line looked like flags from a country where everything is domestic and brave in the same hour. He walked the fence line and tightened the thing he\u2019d tied with the knot he could finally trust because he had learned to trust his own hands tying it. Madrone went ahead and then came back, the way good friends do when a conversation gets interesting. He found the cut wire and made it honest again and considered the places on the land where a gate could be a door and a door could be a boundary that didn\u2019t need to apologize for itself.\n\nRuth came up with coffee in a thermos that had stopped trying to look young three presidents ago, and they drank some leaning on opposite sides of the same post like a marriage that had lasted and not all for good reasons. She grunted at the orchard in a way that meant she noticed and was not going to flatter its progress into arrogance. \u201cYour girl\u2019s leaving,\u201d she said without a question in it. He stared at the apple he had his thumb pressed against and said, \u201cYes,\u201d and did not attempt nobility. Ruth squinted as if trying to make out a shore in fog. \u201cPeople leave,\u201d she said. \u201cLeaves leave. Water leaves. Some of it comes back and some of it comes back as a different thing. I find that insulting and then I get over it and then I get insulted again on schedule. You and your dog will be all right. Your sheep are bored enough to live forever.\u201d He laughed and then the laugh turned sideways and did the other thing laughs do when a day has already had a lot in it.\n\nAt the harbor the boat took on water in the good way, the way that means barrels of it for tanks and not the other kind. Owen did sums with diesel and patience. Hana kissed the deck once, lightly, because there are gods of small blasphemies and it is best to keep them on your side. Marin made a list the size of a palm and stuck it under the edge of a toolbox and did not show it to anyone because sometimes you perform better when the only audience is the part of you that knows what your hands can do. She came up to the hill in the late morning like someone who has been underwater and is pleased, for a minute, by how the air insists. She walked the garden and the beans, cosmically unconcerned with departure, looped themselves insultingly around their lines and offered blossoms with the humility of a thief returning what he stole with interest.\n\n\u201cFriday,\u201d she said, because the word had been measured and could now be said without jinx and without lies. \u201cWe\u2019ll be off sometime after the fog remembers it\u2019s supposed to show off for tourists. We\u2019ll go down past points you know and points I have decided to know, and we\u2019ll wave at people who won\u2019t see us and at people who will take out their phones because this is a country that believes a wave is something to store for later. I will send you the shape of a horizon as often as this stupid box will let me.\u201d She tapped her phone with her forefinger like a farmer lecturing seed. \u201cAnd I will come back when I have done the thing I owe the part of me that believes in rope more than luck.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to say a thing that would make both of them less defenseless, and so he said work, because it was the god she\u2019d named and the one he had also, secretly, found room for. \u201cWork,\u201d he repeated, and it was permission and benediction and the kind of foolish masculinity he would be forgiven for because he was resisting it even while using it as shelter. She put her hand flat in the air between them, not touching his chest and also touching it, because that is how bodies get brave without making a contract and breaking it in the same minute. \u201cStay small,\u201d she said, and the words did not feel like a command but like a compass. He nodded because a nod is the simplest honest punctuation.\n\nThe day of leaving came with fog thick as wool and the kind of quiet in the orchard that happens when the last of the small work is done. He moved the sheep early and they did not argue, which made him suspicious and grateful. He put a note for Ruth on her gate that said the water was set and that he\u2019d walk the upper line at noon and again at evening. He stood with his hands in his pockets a full five minutes before getting into the truck because standing still is a skill and he was trying to deserve it. He drove down to the harbor with Madrone in the passenger seat because she had opinions too and because he didn\u2019t know how to say goodbye to a person and a boat without something in the cab with him that loved him enough to sneeze at his collar.\n\nThe pier had become a bless-and-curse parade, which is to say, a normal day with costumes. Owen moved like a man whose bones had agreed to cooperate with his plans for a set number of hours. Hana wore a life vest like an apology for daring to live. There was a woman with a thermos and a sweater and a laugh like a gull who pressed a muffin into Alec\u2019s hand as if all departures required carbohydrates. Marin was not on deck because of course she was not; she was under, checking a thing with a sound that made sense to her and not to the rest of them. When she came up, it was with her hair rope-loosed and the flannel tied around her waist and a smudge on her cheek that had nothing to do with anything except narrative. She saw Madrone and made the sound a human makes when she recognizes a god she respects that has no interest in being worshipped.\n\nThey did not touch like lovers or like saints. They touched like people who have been working side by side and are about to stop for the length of a season and do not want to lie to each other about what that will cost and what it will pay. He handed her a length of line because handing is safer than asking. She took it and it was then both a line and a thing the two of them had used at the same time for the same reason and therefore a sentence that did not require a verb. Owen yelled a thing that sounded like profanity and caution braided together, and Marin laughed into the wind that had finally decided to come to its job.\n\n\u201cTell your apples I\u2019ll check their papers in winter,\u201d she said, and climbed.\n\n\u201cTell your boat I like her better from above than below,\u201d he said, which is a way of saying we will not glamorize any of this and will love it for real.\n\nThey moved off like a thought that had been sitting at the back of the brain for months and finally came forward and said, listen. The fog lifted its hem to let them under and then dropped it again as if embarrassed by its own sentimentality. He stood on the pier until the last of the mast marks [dis]appeared not in a dramatic vanishing but in a gentle losing that felt more accurate than a cut would have. Madrone sat and then lay down and then put her head on her paws and allowed her ears to interpret the last horn as an instruction to rest.\n\nDriving up the hill, he passed the jacaranda in the parking lot and it had let go the last of its purple and was preparing to go back to a sensible green. He watched the building where he had carried a woman with a bandaged dignity up a flight of stairs and thought about the parts of his body that are useful precisely because they are not excited by the idea of being useful. On his own driveway he stopped the truck halfway up and sat with the engine off and his hands on the wheel and listened to the house make the sounds houses make when you give them a chance to confess their pipes.\n\nIn the afternoon, with the fog thinking about leaving its job early, he walked the orchard and did the small work of touching fruit to see who would come in and who would be left to sweeten a day or two more. He tied up a branch that had decided to prove its generosity by breaking under the weight of its ambition. He used a knot he had not known a month ago and it held with the ease of a thing that had been waiting for him to be ready to use it. In the distance, beyond the eucalyptus and the pale grass and the sign that someone had stuck up properly for the first time in years, he could hear a horn sound not to him and to him both, and he lifted his head as if his neck had been taught to obey a tide. He said, to no one and to everyone that had made him, \u201cWork,\u201d and then he went back to it because work is what holds you until the new shape of your life is no longer something you are only practicing in private.Chapter 6\n\nThe hill wore her absence like a shawl someone forgot on a chair: not tragic, just present, and softer than he would have expected. The mornings didn\u2019t argue; the sheep did what sheep do, which is to entertain the possibility of cooperation while reserving their right to misunderstand. He found that his hands went to the places hers had been without asking him first\u2014the hose hung back on its nail properly, the cardboard tucked with the corners squared, the loppers put away with their jaws closed like a sleeping animal. The apples gave up their last bright stubbornness in a week that pretended to be summer again and wasn\u2019t, and the garlic shouted its intention up through the mulch like arrows deciding to become grammar. In the kitchen he found resin on a glass and left it there two days, an altar to a day with ladders, and then scrubbed it with vinegar and an old brush and felt ridiculous for feeling solemn about success.\n\nTexts arrived from numbers he had given permission to enter his life. From Marin: a horizon drawn as a single line and below it a deck with evidence of breakfast that could have been any ocean\u2019s version of toast, with the caption \u201cgalley admits defeat and then recovers.\u201d The next day, a coil of rope tucked into itself with such satisfaction that it made his palms itch to mess it up, with \u201cShorty approves. I need you to be jealous of this knot to keep balance in the universe.\u201d A sound file he played with his phone held to his ear like something that would leak: water on hull, a pan clinking, someone saying a sentence with calm profanity in the background, a gull laughing the way gulls laugh at our devotion to anything. Then nothing for two days and then two words\u2014\u201cfairgoing, sleepy\u201d\u2014that weren\u2019t technically words but worked because the ocean forgives grammar if the spirits obey physics.\n\nHe brought soup to Evelyn and came away with books to return on the honor system because the honor system had always suited him until it didn\u2019t. At the store he stood in the back while a young poet in a shirt that looked like rain read four pages about a bird that wanted a name for its particular flight and refused them all. He watched Evelyn be the kind of courteous that would prevent cruelty from being comfortable and thought of a life composed of small rescues that no one posts about because they do not look like victory even when they are. They ate dumplings from a place with a menu that seemed to have been translated from joy, sitting on the curb behind the shop because the air was decent and his knees didn\u2019t mind that kind of humility. When he drove back up, the jacaranda had decided it was a sober tree again, and he found he missed the ridiculousness of purple and was ashamed of that for exactly the length of time it takes a dog to decide to nap on the wrong shirt.\n\nRuth\u2019s niece did come, as forecast by the expression on Ruth\u2019s face two weeks earlier, and she was neither villain nor savior, which made the business of resisting her more complicated. Mariah had cheekbones like ambition and a softness around the mouth that meant she had not yet decided if she would be kind and was willing to be persuaded. She walked the fence with Alec and looked at the work the way you look at a thing you have been told is valuable when you are not yet sure how to appraise value. \u201cThere\u2019s money in it,\u201d she said, meaning the land, and he said, \u201cThere\u2019s also time in it,\u201d and watched her flinch at the notion that time could be currency and not be immediately exchangeable. He did not make speeches because speeches invite rebuttal and he wasn\u2019t asking for a debate; he showed her instead how the paper at the base of the apple trees made everything under it taste like rain, and he told her the names of two sheep as if they were neighbors rather than product. When she left, she returned the wire he had unclipped for her like someone who had borrowed a spoon and didn\u2019t want to be accused of bad manners, and he took that as a small win on a board where no points would be recorded.\n\nThe weather leaned, then, the way it does when it is considering doing something memorable. The inland threw back heat for old time\u2019s sake, the sky went blue to the edge of exaggeration, and then the first storm of the year bloomed green on a weather map he scrolled with his finger like someone democracy had placed in charge. Owen called from a number that wasn\u2019t saved because he liked to make sure humans were paying attention, and said the words \u201cwindow\u201d and \u201cbar\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re making our run,\u201d and Alec said, \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d not because he had a right to tell water people what to do but because love will try an imperative even when it prefers permission. Owen said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d with that masculine prayer that pretends not to be a prayer because it swears. When the call ended, the sea at the edge of his hearing lifted in his head like he\u2019d bent down too fast and stood up too quick; he took a breath so deliberate it could have been photographed for instructional purposes and went to check the stock tank because the world insists.\n\nThe morning of the crossing looked like it had been arranged by a production designer who had worked fifteen long years in the church of subtlety and had been fired and replaced by an enthusiastic nephew. The fog tried to hang low and theatrical and then got yanked like a curtain; the swell was long and honest and then, in an hour, had teeth. He put the dog in the truck without saying why, which is how the two of them managed their politics. At the harbor the local men had their hats set at angles that meant they disapproved of the present and of the future besides; the women had thermoses and saw everything and said only what would be of use. The bar\u2014that shallow tantrum between the ocean and the mouth of safe water\u2014wore patches of white like spills and then arranged itself into something that was almost a rhythm and then insulted anyone who tried to name it. He saw the ketch nose out past the last mooring and felt, more than saw, the moment where courage can\u2019t distinguish itself from faith and so, to be safe, calls in a favor from skill.\n\nThe boat rose and fell in a way that made sense to the part of his body that had watched horses test their riders and hills test their hikers and sheep test every fence post he had ever nailed. It went up a green wall and came down the quiet behind it and then met a cross pulse like a lie told by a friend. The engine announced its existence the way engines announce their existence when they are being asked to reconcile their self-image with physics. Hana stood just abaft the mast with a line coiled like a polite threat, and Owen\u2019s legs were braced in a stance that was nothing at all like dancing and had all of dance\u2019s honesty. He did not see Marin on deck and knew better now than to say her name into the wind inside his skull like a spell. The boat made the bar\u2019s middle and found a seam and slid along it like someone who knows how to move through a room where they are both loved and resented, and then a set came in with the timing of a party crasher and stood up. The nose lifted and then the whole world went the color of a bottle and the boat did not fall off her line so much as accept a slap with dignity\u2019s back teeth clenched.\n\nHe realized he had his arm around Madrone\u2019s neck in a way that implied he needed the dog more than the dog needed oxygen and made his hand open because he was trying to be better in the small ways first. The ketch came down into the harbor\u2019s safety with the gracelessness that makes real life seem virtuous, and the pier\u2019s voice changed from collective inhale to the kind of exhale that comes with a muttered critique of daring. Owen flashed the briefest look to the end of the pier where people had been standing with the attention of gamblers and then took a breath he wasn\u2019t going to admit to and pointed the boat toward a slip he had no business owning and every right to take if he could manage it. Alec had not noticed he\u2019d walked until he found himself on the fuel dock where the men whose hats had decided on pessimism were now generously agreeing to help. He had rope in his hands before he had earned it; Hana threw and he caught, and it was the easiest thing the day had asked anyone to do.\n\nIt should have ended there in the comparative boredom of tying up and swearing at cleats. The storm, bored with bureaucracy, stiffened a gust just as Hana stepped nowhere that was floor, and it wasn\u2019t a dramatic fall in theatrical blue water, just the invention of a gap between deck and dock at the wrong second. They slid and vanished with a sound that was all syllable and no language, and the part of Alec that had made the hole in Penny\u2019s side months ago without letting his hand shake because he had chosen competence over panic put on its boots without asking his permission. He was on his stomach before his brain bothered to object, rope around his forearm the way Hana had taught him with their ridiculous patience, and the cold hand of the harbor slapped him in the face with its old joke about consequence. Someone yelled in a tone that had too much neighbor in it and not enough command, and a woman reached for a ring buoy like a saint reaching for her icon, but Nikolai physics was already in the room and demanded a different old story.\n\nHana\u2019s face came up where the dock doesn\u2019t love anyone; their eyes had the rolled-back white of a horse\u2019s for half a second and then came forward like a man who has remembered his wallet. Alec got the rope under ribs and around without asking consent because there are times when consent is not a form signed but an equation solved and the only number you need is two human bodies not drowning. He did the bowline the way you do the prayer you learned from a parent you argued with for twenty years; it sat the way a good dog sits when company comes. He leaned out too far, too stupidly, the water got his chest and found out what fear tastes like, and he used the angry strength of a person who has had enough of apologizing to pull a human being whose breath he wanted to hear again to where other hands could be hands without taking a college class first.\n\nThere were hands, thank God there were hands, and the kind of shouted instruction that does not question its own authority. Owen appeared on the dock without the geometry that gets a man there from a moving deck with dignity, and it didn\u2019t matter because he had the swearing voice and the eyes that make fragile people obey and sturdy people try. The knot, the good knot, held, and Hana came up on the dock like a fish that had agreed to become an anecdote and coughed in a way that made the old woman with the thermos start to cry with relief and annoyance. Alec discovered he was bleeding from a very honest place on his elbow and laughed, which is not a sign of comedy but of a body using air to prove its point. Madrone had been sent back by a reasonable part of a reasonable man at the last second and stood now with her whole body pointed at what she would have done if she had been allowed, and it was enough to make everyone involved pretend they were more competent than they felt.\n\nThere was no grand conclusion. The engine sulked and then settled, the lines lay down like animals convinced, the swells kept having their opinions and no one argued with them any longer. Hana, blanketing a shiver with vulgarity, touched the knot and said, ridiculously, \u201cThat\u2019s tidy,\u201d and Alec could not make his face do anything sensible for a minute. Owen clapped him on the shoulder and then realized he had clapped the wrong shoulder for a man who had a cut on his arm and then clapped the other shoulder because you do not undo a thank you by apologizing for its form. A paramedic with a soft voice that had seen bigger lunacies put a dry blanket where it would be useful and made sure Hana\u2019s teeth were the kind that chatter and not the other kind. Someone tried to tell the story already and got it wrong, and someone else told it better, and the whole thing settled as quickly as a version of an event can, which is to say, not very, but enough to get on with the rest of the day.\n\nLater, back on the hill, the dog did not let him take off his boots without inspecting the new geography of his elbow, and he let the inspection happen because she had come from a long line of beings who had been denied too much honesty by traps and fences and leashes and humans who wanted their obedience without promising their steadiness. He washed the cut in the sink like a child and put a clean cloth on it that would not pass for professionalism and would pass for care. The garden smelled like billowed paper and mushroom breath and his own shirt, stupidly, smelled like harbor, like diesel and rope and panic that had done its work and been demoted. He got a text from an unknown number that said \u201cYou saved my kid,\u201d which was moving and wrong because Hana had been saving themselves for twenty years and had only allowed him to interrupt that with a rope when the math required it, but he let the gratitude land like a small coin you don\u2019t spend because you like the shape.\n\nA message came from Marin after midnight when the house had remembered what electricity sounds like and he had not, \u201cWe cleared and then got slapped twice for our sins. All good. A feeling made me breathe like someone running and not running. Did the land move under you? Did you tell it to wait?\u201d He stared at the little bright lies on the screen that feel like stars if you\u2019re lonely enough and wrote back, \u201cPulled someone out of a mistake with your knot. They did most of the work and we yelled good things at physics. Dog supervised. Apples pretending not to be proud.\u201d There was a pause long enough to respect distance and then, \u201cLanguage received. Tide says hi. Proud of you and of the bowline. Stay small,\u201d and a picture of something that could have been dawn or weed cloth, which was fitting.\n\nHe slept for a piece of an hour and woke to the sound of a truck that wasn\u2019t his on the drive and the discipline, newly minted, to let the visitor make their noise before composing a defense. It was Ruth with the niece again, more paper that had too much color and a face that had been introduced to the reality that the county does not read poetry. They sat at the table and the dog offered her head in installments to new hands, and he found himself speaking about floodplains and feed bills and the market price for wool like a man who had decided to use all the long words in his store on one day. Mariah watched the small muscle at his jaw jump and then stop jumping because he made it stop, and something in her expression shifted the way a field does when you finally lay in some water and it stops pretending it is nothing but dust. She said, surprising herself, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s that I am trying to decide if what I know is allowed to matter where I live,\u201d and he said, surprising himself, \u201cIt\u2019s allowed to matter where you stand, and the trick is to stand long enough that the permission becomes boring.\u201d\n\nHe went to see Evelyn after lunch because she had sent the kind of message people send when they are trying to be light and cannot resist the gravitational pull of truth. She had a bruise blooming on her temple that looked like the kind of flower the basil would have disapproved of, and she had a look like someone who had been told to rest for legitimate reasons and had only a kindergarten\u2019s worth of experience doing so. He set a kettle on and made a tea that had no right to be soothing and was, and when she asked if he had gone to the harbor the way a person asks a single question to mean a dozen, he said he had and then didn\u2019t say the other names because loyalty sometimes looks like omission. She told him about a customer who had cried in the stacks without apology and how she had taken him to the maps section and asked him to pick a place and he had chosen Nova Scotia because his grandfather had been from there and because the word comforted him even if the latitude did not. He told her he liked the idea that saying a word could warm a person and made a grocery list in his head for more beans and dog food and aspirin and then remembered that life is not a list, no matter how many lists keep it from becoming unbearable.\n\nThe storm worked itself out over two days, like a couple that argues properly, and left everything cleaner and meaner. The hills went the color of secrets right before the person you love decides to tell you one, and the fences shone in a way that made them seem new despite being exactly as crooked as before. The sheep found a limb someone had left too low and stripped it of its dignity, and he laughed because it felt good to be angry at a small thing again after considering the size of the water. He walked the orchard with a roll of tape and a pocket of clips and the sigh of a man who has broken and mended the same thing four times and still believes in the virtue of preparation. He tied up a limb not because it was in danger today but because the habit of rescue is a muscle that is either trained or not, and he had decided he wanted that muscle to be honest.\n\nA week later the boat sent a picture of a cove that looked invented, and then another of a gas station with pelicans on the sign as if they were advertising fuel for birds. Owen called long enough to say they\u2019d had a row with a customs official that was resolved with paperwork and humility, and that the engine had stopped being offended by the way it was constantly being asked to do the one thing it had been built to do. Hana sent a photograph of their forearm with a welt in the shape of a cleat and the caption \u201cit tried to name me and failed, as all gods will,\u201d and he laughed aloud in the kitchen and startled the dog, who does not believe in gods except the ones who carry beef jerky.\n\nHe did the thing Ruth had asked in the old, uncomfortable way of women who expect competence and do not need gratitude to give them courage. He went to a meeting and said a sentence about water rights that made a man with a good suit and an unsubtle watch look at him like he had said a thing in a language that was not supposed to be spoken at public microphones. He went to a different meeting and said nothing and listened to a neighbor with bad knees and an acre of goats talk about loneliness in a way that allowed the room to look at their phones less and their hands more. He came home from both meetings feeling like he had sat through the first half of a movie with a score too earnest and decided to be the person who does not give up on art or policy just because evening comes.\n\nOctober remembered itself and became the kind of month that arranges light like people arrange knives and forks for a meal that is meant to be decent. The garlic took itself seriously and the beans refused to stop even when the nights told them they were being ridiculous. The apples became a chore that was also a gift and then a memory, as all good chores are. He picked the last of them with Madrone watching like a superintendent and took a bag down to the bookstore and set it on the counter with the note \u201cfor staff and basil\u201d because humor is a way to request forgiveness for your generosity. Evelyn set one aside and said she would take it home and leave it where she could see its bruises and perhaps learn something about mercy for produce and for herself.\n\nOn a morning that did not try to be anything but a morning, the day on the hill stood in front of him with its map folded wrong. A car he did not know came up slow with its turn signal still clicking from the main road like a nervous habit; a woman he did not know stepped out wearing a uniform that had already taught her that people will attempt to make it a costume when they want to argue. She had a folder and a face that had been trained to deliver news in sizes, and he had the immediate impulse to say \u201cno\u201d before he knew what it was he was refusing. She looked past him at the fence and the dog and the shape of a hill that believes in privacy and said, \u201cAre you Alexander Jameson,\u201d and he said, \u201cI am, but try Alec,\u201d and she said, \u201cSometimes I can try, and sometimes I am not allowed,\u201d which made him like her even as he began to dislike everything else that was about to happen.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the worst thing and it wasn\u2019t the best because those are category errors; it was the truth, on paper, that a storm farther south had made a choice and then made it again and that choices have consequences even for the competent. A man at a harbor with a different name had called a line too loud and a hand had slipped on metal and the water had done its work and then apologized to no one, because water does not apologize. It was not fatal, which sentence sits in the mouth like dry bread and does not soften for tea, and it was not nothing. It was the kind of news that requires driving and whispering and a phone call at two in the morning when you don\u2019t trust anyone to tell you what happened unless you can hear their breath misbehaving while they do. She handed him the papers like someone handing a person ghostweights and he set them on the hood of his truck because he was not ready to let them into the house where coffee had happened and laughter had been stored.\n\n\u201cWho,\u201d he said, and she gave a name that was almost familiar and then clicked into the place where familiarity becomes grief. It wasn\u2019t Marin and he tried to put the \u201cnot\u201d into the right part of his body without it doing damage on the way. It was a man who had taught Marin to hold the shroud with soft hands and who had said the thing about knots remembering themselves and had a laugh like a crow bragging; it was someone he wanted to have a beer with later and now would have to settle for using a word like memorial without feeling like a politician. \u201cWe need to notify next of kin,\u201d she said, and he heard in the way she said kin that she did not mean it only legally, and he knew that the word is wider than blood when a body has given its labor to a community. He took a breath and then he took another and then he said, \u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d He had the ridiculous thought that he should bring apples and then felt grateful for the part of his heart that reaches for fruit before reaching for formal speech.\n\nThe dog did the practical thing and got into the truck because that is who she was when the world couldn\u2019t decide which version of itself to be. He made three calls in the kind of order that you can only hope makes sense in hindsight. Ruth said, \u201cI will tell who needs telling up north,\u201d because land has its own phone tree, and a man at the harbor answered on the second ring with a sound that required a stillness Alec did not know he could require from himself and then said, \u201cI know,\u201d and \u201cI am with his sister,\u201d and \u201cYes, yes,\u201d and then an exhale that was not approval and not complaint, something else. He drove with the officer because she had to be there and because it is wrong to make people go alone into rooms where others will become different forever. He did not speak in the cab except when a nonsense syllable escaped and that nonsense, for once, was what language had been designed for; she let it exist and did not ask it to present its papers.\n\nThe rooms that held the people who needed to know were not dramatic. A kitchen with magnets that had ideas about vacations and a bowl with a few apples past their prime that made him want to steal them to spare someone\u2019s pride; a living room with a couch that had been held down properly for years; a porch with a chair that had seen all weathers. He said a name over and over like a person tilling hard ground, and each time the sound made a different halo in the air and then fell. Grief has a paperwork that humiliates everyone it touches because it insists on spelling; they signed things in triplicate and the women around him kept putting water where it would do good and a man kept trying to fix something that did not need fixing at this moment because his hands were built to be of use and could not accept that the work right now was to be useless. He drove back up the hill when it was dark enough that every other car looked like a confession that had decided to leave town, and the dog put her head on his thigh and left it there until his fingers remembered the shape of her ear and so did the rest of him.\n\nHe wrote to Marin, in the middle of the night, when the part of the world that had gotten the news by siren and document finally went to sleep and the part that gets it by tide was awake. He did not craft. He said, \u201cI am told you know already but I couldn\u2019t not say it. I am here for the sister, and the women are here for me and for themselves, and the knot did not fail, which is not the point. I have apples. I have soup in an arrogant pot. I have your line of paper around the trees and I am sitting near them because stillness is the only way I have to listen as far as where you are.\u201d He did not expect an answer because expecting anything from a body in a storm is a small sin; he got one at dawn that said, \u201cWe heard it. We felt the hole. It isn\u2019t a hole the way a map shows you them; it is the other kind. We are coming in. Not to leave, to speak to water in a way that does not require forgiveness. Keep the dog. Keep the apples. Keep your hands clean and your rope handy.\u201d\n\nBy noon the sky had become the color of a bruise in its late, bragging stage. Owen called him and said nothing but his name twice and then an address and then hung up, which is efficient and which Alec appreciated and which made his heart speed up in a way that got old and new fear to shake hands. He drove again and found Owen standing outside the harbor office looking both like a man who had spent too many nights not sleeping and a boy who had learned a new word in a dangerous language and wanted to say it in the wrong room. They stood like men whose bodies had been built to absorb weather and whose faces had been built to give women less to worry about than they deserved to have; they failed, which was good. Owen said, \u201cWe could use someone who knows what a fence is for,\u201d and Alec laughed, unexpected, because what do you call the work of standing between your people and the version of the world that wants to behave like a weapon if not fencing.\n\nThey wrapped rope around posts that had not been designed for this exact load and made them accept it; they hung tarps where the sky had given up on the notion of privacy; they moved boxes that had tried to become oceans and put them into rooms that had not been built to hold them. Hana came up the dock with their mouth set in a line like a thread ready to be threaded and said, \u201cI will not tell this story yet, but when I do I will only use new words,\u201d and he saluted them in a stupid way that did the work anyway. He found a boy with a hat too clean and taught him the knot he had used because the boy would either be needed for it later or not, and either way Alec would be able to pretend he had done one thing correctly today. He found places for hands to rest so they would not shake. He found water for a mouth that would not accept wine until the wine was required. He found quiet where people could do the thing grief requires in a country that does not forgive it: nothing.\n\nThe first night after the news, he slept on the couch because it had become the piece of furniture that agreed to his arrangements with the dark. He woke at three to a silence that rang, and for a second he thought he had become an idea a person had had about how men should be when the world uses them as tools and then felt the weight of his foot on the floor and realized he still was. He went out into the yard and stood by the cardboard turned soil and said the only prayer he knew that did not feel like a letter to a stranger: thank you for work. He could not feel the sea from here in the same way as sometimes; it had decided to be its own weather and had gone somewhere else with its noise. He put his hand on the place where the rope cuts into his palm when it is doing what it was made to do, and he felt the fibers that were not there and accepted that memory is a way a body injures itself in exchange for keeping a person you loved alive long enough to finish one sentence.\n\nIn the days after, the hill settled back into doing the part of living that no one rewards because it involves very few parentheses. Ruth came up with her braid tired and looked at him for a long time without asking him to perform a competence he did not possess; she nodded once and said, \u201cAll right then,\u201d which is the kind of benediction landowners can give to the men who mind their fence lines. Evelyn came with soup that had pretended to be ambitious and then remembered the virtue of being itself, and she left it on the counter without demanding he say anything besides its temperature. Wyatt brought a zucchini in November because plants do not know when to stop and neither do a lot of people, and when Alec laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of that particular green, he felt like someone had placed a hand on his chest in the exact right spot and told his heart to keep doing its job.\n\nMarin came up in a borrowed car because of course she did, who else but a person who believes in knots enough to leave would borrow a car rather than pretend the act of returning didn\u2019t require other people\u2019s engines. She wore a jacket that had seen three kinds of weather in one day and had salt on it that the hill did not understand and resin on a sleeve the kitchen was already familiar with and a face that had been asked by geography to provide a larger map than she had had the audacity to think she owned. She stood at the fence. He came to the fence. They did not perform obligation or romance; they performed the exact pressure of hands on wood and then on cloth and then on skin that makes a human admit the day is, in fact, real. She said his name like an address where she had been before and he said hers like a compass that had stopped being a suggestion. The dog made the sound a dog makes when she\u2019s glad and neutral and knows everyone is trying their best.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not done with him,\u201d Marin said, not about the dead exactly, but not not, and he understood she meant more than his body and more than memory and more than the water\u2019s tendency to make everything it touches equally its own. \u201cWe will tell it right,\u201d she added, and he nodded, because the telling is either the saving or it is insult, and there are no other options that keep you the kind of person you can live with. They went to the orchard because standing in rooms is something you do when you are done for the day with the difficult work of being seen in daylight, and it wasn\u2019t yet time to go inside anywhere. They walked between trees that had shed their jobs for the season and looked like old men at a bus stop, and they spoke of nothing you could put on paper and everything you could keep for later in the place in the chest people keep for nuts and nails and photographs.\n\nWhen she left that night, she put her hand on the knot of his elbow where the cut had just learned not to be offended by movement, and he felt something rearrange that was not desire and not duty and had the shape of both, which is to say the shape of a thing you can safely build around. He stood by the gate and watched her taillights go down the drive and felt not abandoned and not attended, but held in a conversation the land had considered him worthy of overhearing. The sea sent a sound along the low places between houses and fences, and he heard it as the only language that never lies: something large continuing to exist.\n\nHe slept some hours without interruption and woke to the kind of morning the coast allows after indulgence, plain and almost severe. He took the dog out and they walked the new piece of fence he had built to appease his own nervous system and found a place where the wire wanted better and made it so. He went to the garden and pressed his palm flat on what had been paper and was now nearly a substrate and thought, uselessly and accurately, \u201cWe did that,\u201d meaning the three of them\u2014woman, man, dog\u2014and a handful of worms who had signed no contracts and made more difference than anyone else. He made coffee that tasted like the end of a monologue and then, because the day had asked nothing too large yet, he went to the sink and washed the bowl that had held the soup and the knife that had cut the zucchini and did not put the knife down until it shone like reason. He did not look at his phone for an hour because he had decided that attention, paid without interest, is the only wealth he will not be ashamed to leave to anyone after all this is done.Chapter 9\n\nThe first rain came like an apology written neatly in the margin of a page the year had already filled with other plans. It rained in a way that reminded him of childhood, when water still knew how to go where it had been taught, and the creek in the arroyo remembered its groove and praised it. The second rain came harder and forgot its manners altogether. By the third, the sky had stopped doing anything as polite as weather and had started in on a project. The radio called it an atmospheric river with the kind of earnest authority that made you forgive its fondness for metaphors, and the eucalyptus threw down their leaves the way bored men toss cards in a game they didn\u2019t mean to win. The hill took it at first, patient, sucking like a dry sponge until the sponge learned how to leak.\n\nHe had been waiting for this since he stapled his lease to the inside of a kitchen cabinet a year ago and wrote the numbers down on a piece of tape like talismans: the water, the water, the water. He walked fence and checked posts that looked sturdy when sober and less so when the ground under them started to think about other careers. He moved the ewes before they asked, which is a courtesy they do not recognize, and still he offered it because dignity in animals is contagious if you let it be. Madrone wore the rain with that resigned optimism all good dogs keep for days when every smell gets turned up to the kind of volume that makes sense only if you are built for it. He covered the woodpile and then uncovered it because the wind persuaded him his system of ropes needed revision, and he found himself thanking Hana under his breath for a lesson about half-hitches and leverage that had seemed like a game under a sunny mast and now moved his hands as if they had been taught long before he was born.\n\nTexts came like bottles thrown from a party. From Marin: \u201csouth of Ensenada. Boat and crew pretending at wisdom. Rain everywhere, different style. You?\u201d From Owen: \u201cbar is a rumor down here, different insults. You\u2019d hate it and love it. Keep your head, goats in our street down here, everywhere is everywhere.\u201d From Ruth: \u201cpower probably going down. Tanks full? niece convinced rain is opportunity. you\u2019ll like her better this week.\u201d From Evelyn: a picture of the bookstore door propped with a milk crate and mop water making a series of sincere lakes just inside. He told her to close and to go home and to let the jacaranda decide what season it was without her; she wrote back bossy and good, okay Dad, and sent a second photo of basil cut down before flowering like proof that she could be taught.\n\nThat night, the wind stopped negotiating and started taking. The hill became the kind of instrument you only touch if you both want to play and are prepared to be played. Down along the arroyo, where he\u2019d spent half of summer cutting thistle and cursing whoever had planted pampas grass as if it were a pet, the brown water lifted itself over its banks with a smoothness that made violence look elegant. It went through the fences like a rumor through a town where no one can afford to ignore gossip. He went out with a headlamp and an optimism he did not insult himself by naming courage and checked his corners. The cardboard in the garden swelled until it looked like pillows under a quilt; he pressed his hand down and felt the busy heat of undoing still going to work under all that indifference. He told the dog not to be a hero. The dog listened because she knew that heroes get themselves killed when no one needs them to, and the world\u2019s already full.\n\nAt two in the morning his phone sang the blunt note of something that had not waited its turn. It was Ruth\u2019s number but Mariah spoke in the clipped sentences of someone who had sat in a car with the wipers going full speed and only seen their own fear in the glass. \u201cThe road above the lower gate just\u2026 a piece went. Aunt Ruth won\u2019t let me say slide like the news says. But that\u2019s what it is. There\u2019s a sedan there. They tried to turn around and they\u2019re nose down. Lights on. No one hurt yet. I think. I think there\u2019s a woman inside.\u201d The part of him that had loved tricks\u2014that had once believed you could get away with living as if people didn\u2019t care if you went missing for an afternoon\u2014left the room, and the part that knew what to do with rope took its chair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d he said, and he was already putting on the boots that had only just stopped believing they were wet. He grabbed the coil he had kept by the door since the harbor taught him that rope within reach is a friend you won\u2019t betray. He took the old rescue bag with the ring buoy he had thought a joke when he bought it at a yard sale and had kept because fate likes tidy circles. Madrone stood at the truck door with the complaint dogs use when they intend to forgive you if you behave; he pointed at her bed and said \u201cstay,\u201d and she went the way disciplined love goes, reluctantly, without sulking.\n\nThe road to Ruth\u2019s lower gate had been paved by a man who loved his work and compromised when he had to. Tonight, a piece of it had decided to return to the idea of gravity. He parked before the place where the berm had given up and the shoulder had become the bright mud that knows how to laugh at plans. The sedan sat nose down in what had been a drainage ditch and was now a small river with ambitions. Its rear tires spun in a black shine every few seconds because panic has its own schedule. Inside, in the light that made faces look like masks, a woman held the wheel with both hands as if it were telling the truth. The current pushed at the car with the persuasion of someone with time. Beyond it, the lower pasture was a new lake, and his fence there had become a line of ideology.\n\nHe took the coil and fed it to himself around his shoulder the way Hana had shown him so a pull on the rope would not be a pull on the brain stem. He tied a bowline to his own belt because his hands knew that prayer now. He set the other end around the base of the old oak that had outlived three landlords and two significant weather events and had a root system philosophy books had written about in secret. The knot was not art\u2014it was the kind of clove hitch you put on when time is offended by your preferences\u2014and it held because it had to. He shouted into rain, felt ridiculous, and did it again because ridiculous is sometimes what a person is before competence changes their voice. The woman inside turned her head toward him and in the moving light he recognized Mrs. Patel from down in Evelyn\u2019s building, the one who had freaked out at the last concussion and had brought soup in jars and scolded everyone for not owning slippers.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t open the door!\u201d he yelled, feeling his mouth make shapes like kindergarten. \u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019m going to put a line on your car.\u201d The water tugged at his thighs with that muscular, intimate offense only water has when you have told it you intend to argue. He moved like he was in tall grass and found the hook on the sedan\u2019s rear frame by faith and touch and the anger of a man who has had to untie too many things for other people. He got the rope around and cinched it with a trucker\u2019s hitch he had learned from a video at two in the morning once when sleep had said no and thought, stupidly, bless every bored night I ever lived through. He pointed at Mariah, who had appeared at his shoulder with her hair plastered to her skull like a sermon, and said, \u201cTake a wrap on the oak. When I say take, take, and when I say hold, hold,\u201d and she did, because inclination toward argument dies in the blood in certain weather.\n\nHe went forward, boots sliding toward the impossible. The ditch was deeper near the culvert and the water there did the persuasive thing of trying to move his feet apart and take him down by suggesting he had ankles he didn\u2019t need. He leaned into the rope, the way he had leaned into the dock that day, and the memory burned through his body like instruction. Hana had said, \u201cKeep your body a line,\u201d in a different place, and he did. He got to the driver\u2019s side and the woman inside shook her head because everyone knows that opening a door in a river is the way you drown in it. He pounded on the glass the way you do to a neighbor you love who won\u2019t get out of bed in a fire. \u201cWindow!\u201d he shouted. \u201cJust the window.\u201d She put the button down and the water came in with the long-prepared dignity of an invited guest who has been insulted by delay. He shoved the ring buoy at her and she took it in both hands like a hymnbook and held on. \u201cOut!\u201d he said, and touched her elbow, because contact, when gentle, is a bridge shame can cross without complaint.\n\nShe was smaller than her voice, which no one had ever told her, and the cold made her breath a stuck machine. He kept her face up and his own mouth above the idiot insistence of the water and said nonsense syllables because nonsense is how you make the body allow the brain to stay. Mariah took when he said take and held when he said hold, and the rope said nothing about any of it and obeyed. He got her to the lip where the ditch had become road again, and the two of them slid in a long, expensive scrape along gravel and mud and ended in a pile of limbs and curses and tears that all belonged to the day and to none of them in particular. He lay there because lying down makes gravity seem like a friend, and the rain put cold coins on his face until he chose breath and sat up.\n\nThey got Mrs. Patel into the cab of his truck and turned the heat on like it had been invented for them personally. She kept apologizing to God and to him and to the culvert, which seemed fair, and to nobody in particular for the state of her hair, which was not. He made a joke about slippers to prove the world was intact enough to afford nonsense and she said a thing in Gujarati that meant either idiot or son and rested her head against the window like a child who will never tell anyone who saved her because she does not want to be accused of gratitude.\n\nHe drove her down to Evelyn\u2019s because that was where her spare key lived and because the jacaranda, even out of bloom, knows where bodies need to be laid down. Evelyn opened her door before he knocked because the rain had told her there would be knocking and who. She put Mrs. Patel on the couch with a blanket that had never forgiven college students for how they use couches and set a kettle on because kettles are what women who have run out of hands set on. She did not cry in the doorway; she cried in the kitchen where the dog couldn\u2019t see and came back with tea and a look on her face like the surface of a lake when a small fish jumps and no one else saw it.\n\nHe called Ruth from the landing and told her about the oak and the rope and where the car was and what the county would need to call that culvert now, and Ruth said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell them it was always like that; it will save us an argument,\u201d which was love, too.\n\nOn the way back to the hill, the roads looked like they had been drawn in pencil on wet paper, and the wipers worked like penitent men. He stopped by the lower gate and stared at the cut in the earth because awe is what you owe efficient destruction. The water would carve a new path whether he argued or not. He marked the posts with flags like priest work and told himself to pretend he enjoyed being an acolyte. Madrone met him at the door with the outrage of a being kept from work and then forgave him in a single leaning gesture that meant we are as good as we could be today.\n\nThe power went the way everyone had promised and the house forgot it had nerves. He lit the stove by match like an apology and warmed the kitchen until it felt like a temporary church. In the morning the rain paused long enough for people to think they had earned it and then took another breath, and he used the reprieve to move the flock farther up, to a pocket where water would have to explain itself to Devonian strata before it could get rude. On the way, Penny tried to convince him she had earned one last graze on a patch that wanted to be a pond, and he used a tone he had used only twice before in his life to say no.\n\nOut beyond the eucalyptus, a sound came that had never made him think of anything but time until recently: a horn, long and low, a thing thrown across space for the purpose of tidying up a distance. He stopped and listened and pictured a deck going up and down in a long pulse and hands around a mug and a rope coiling itself because a person with salt on her sleeves had told it to. He carried that sound into the afternoon like a coin in his pocket and didn\u2019t spend it on worry. At noon the rain lost interest in itself, and a light came through like good news in a family that is used to news of a different kind. He walked the orchard and found a limb that had tried to be generous under a foot of water and failed; he tied it up with a new piece of rope that did not yet know his house and told it to stay. It did.\n\nBy evening the road above the lower gate had a sawhorse with the county\u2019s signature on it, and men in jackets that implied competence stood in the rain and gestured at the hole like it was a patient who needed encouragement. The sedan had been hauled out and sat on the side with mud like a rough new paint job; he ran his hand down it like a horse and felt shame for the affection he felt for an object that had been persuaded into a kind of heroism. Mrs. Patel sent a text that had only emojis and two words, \u201cmy slippers,\u201d and he realized he was going to love her for the exact reason he had always loved women who worry about small things while the house burns down: because someone has to keep the room polite until we can again.\n\nThe storm moved south in the way important things occasionally remember other people exist. The hills exhaled. Fences leaned back into their old arguments. The dogs in the county slept because they\u2019d earned it. He slept too, hard and low, until the hour the whales sometimes make him awake, and when he woke he did not hear them because the sea had tasks that did not involve applause. He listened instead to the new creek where the old pasture had been and decided he could stand to learn a different map in his head without feeling as if he had betrayed the one he had memorized.\n\nIn the days after, the work acquired a cleanliness unusual for winter. Mud took on the moral qualities of stubbornness. He repaired the lower run from scratch because sometimes the thing to do is to refuse achievement and choose good. Mariah arrived with gloves and an apology for the way she had once used the phrase \u201cuntapped potential\u201d in a sentence about land and used herself up that afternoon pulling new line while he held staples in his teeth like a cartoon he had sworn never to become. She did not say sorry for previous brochures. She said, when they paused and the weather remembered how to warm a human face, \u201cYou were right. Time is currency. I had no idea how expensive decent things are,\u201d and he said nothing, because accepting an apology on behalf of the world is a power he does not trust himself with. She stayed until dark put its coat on and then stayed another twenty minutes because staying is how you tell someone you are learning who you are.\n\nNews from the south came in postcards of pixels. A bay so quiet it made you suspicious. A taco he could smell through a screen. A rope burn on a wrist that had been asked to hold something heavier than the wrist had believed it could. Marin sent the name of a cove that sounded like a woman who knows she can get away with a crime and does not have to try. \u201cWe anchored,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe fixed things that were not broken to make sure they knew who was in charge. We named a gull. The gull ignored us. Stay small?\u201d He wrote back, \u201cSaved a woman with a ring buoy. I will not accept hero as a job title. Dog disapproves of my restraint,\u201d and she wrote, \u201cTell the dog I have no use for heroes either, only for people who can carry water without making it about their backs.\u201d\n\nHe took Evelyn bread and got back his ring buoy with a sticker of a whale on it because Mrs. Patel had insisted that a thing that has saved a person should be decorated like a child\u2019s cast. He and Evelyn sat on the floor of her kitchen instead of the chairs because old knees are young when you treat them with humility. She told him a thing about her father he had never heard because he had always loved her in the part of her life where she didn\u2019t tell family stories unless anger made her feet move faster. He told her he had decided to forgive himself for not becoming the version of a man he had imagined at nineteen because he had never liked that man and had made him up to use as an excuse, and she said, \u201cGood,\u201d with the quiet of someone who had been waiting for a sentence for years and had decided not to nag the person who owed it. They washed dishes together because even two plates looks like ceremony when there has been water everywhere.\n\nThe hill greened in a way that was not shy. The beans, which had no business remaining alive, attempted another argument with the calendar, and he told them kindly to accept the world as it is and let him pull them. The garlic meant business in a way that would have made a sensible person sigh with relief and frightened him a little instead because competence in plants can look like arrogance if you don\u2019t watch your tone. He laid more paper around trunks because he had become the kind of man who believes in cardboard, which meant he had become the kind of man who believes in slow magic, which meant he had become the kind of man who could attend his own life properly.\n\nAt the harbor, Owen had built a shrine out of the useless pieces left from a fix that had finally become more fix than story. It wasn\u2019t a shrine, he\u2019d say; it was a box of spares. But someone had put a photograph under plexiglass and someone else had left a thermos with the lid off and a third person had stuck a little carved fool on the edge who looked like every man they knew who still believed the sea was just a large lake with better publicity. Hana wore their welt like a new tattoo and pretended to be annoyed when anyone asked. They cornered Alec by the ice machine and said, \u201cYou pulled me. Don\u2019t practice humility all the way into lying about it,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou saved yourself,\u201d and they said, \u201cI would like both things to be true,\u201d and he said, \u201cAll right,\u201d and in that moment something about his face shifted in a way even the dog noticed.\n\nHe and Ruth and Mariah went to a county meeting where men who had never leaned over a fence argued about watersheds like they were arguing about novels, and the women in the back row traded glances and weather reports. Alec said less than he had brought, which is a kind of wealth. After, in the parking lot, Mariah told a staffer in a green jacket the names of the three houses that had nearly been lost, and the staffer wrote them down like rare birds, which made Alec feel both ridiculous and seen. The staffer asked Alec what he needed and he said, \u201cGravel and time,\u201d and the staffer laughed in that bureaucratic way that means I know and I can\u2019t and sometimes I can, and then, a week later, a truck came with a load exactly large enough to make faith seem temporarily practical.\n\nThere was a morning when the fog came low and warm and the whales were audible and he had the petty impulse to keep it to himself like a sweet he\u2019d promised to share. He texted Marin anyway, because love, in its cleanest version, is a thing you give from the pantry and not from the last piece of candy you hid. She sent back, \u201cSaw a thing I will never say out loud because the ocean will hear and make me pay. Tell your dog I saw three dogs that are seals and one seal that is a dog.\u201d\n\nOn a Tuesday he found a lamb in trouble with pneumonia that had not announced itself the way books say it will, and he did the sharp work of deciding something about suffering before lunch and hated himself only a little for how easily the hands followed orders once the orders had been written. He buried it under the oak that had held his rope because contracts are made in sets. He said a sentence out loud none of his people would ever hear and felt stupid and decent simultaneously. That afternoon he went down to the bookstore and stood in the maps aisle and traced a line from the bay where the ketch might be to any point where land became inevitable, and he thought, the world is too large; then he remembered stay small and thought, all right, and chose instead a book about knots with pictures that made him want to go drink a beer with the photographer.\n\nThe day that arranged itself along a single axis, the one that had been promised by an earlier paragraph in a life that liked to foreshadow, did not start special. It began with a sock that would not dry even though the rest of the laundry had obeyed the laws of linen. It moved into a dog with a burr in an indecent place and a man and a pair of scissors negotiating whose embarrassment was owed to whom. He was halfway through fencing the east line by noon, the part that had become a theory because the earth did not agree with its own angles anymore, and he would have told anyone who asked that heroism was a vocabulary he had no intention of practicing in public again this month. The text came from a number he didn\u2019t save because he doesn\u2019t save numbers that he believes belong to situations that will go away: a ranger in Los Osos who had been at the county meeting and looked at his hands while he spoke like he was a man who could be given a job without asking for a receipt. \u201cWe have a car in the culvert under South Bay. Two inside. Fire en route but slow. We have rope and not enough of it. Someone said you know what a fence is for,\u201d the text said, and he laughed once, unwisely, because familiar phrases make the body pretend it is being blessed.\n\nHe went. Of course he went. He did not think of what people would say. He thought of water, which was no longer his enemy because enemies are a luxury he had stopped carrying along with extra pride. The culvert was exactly what anyone who has spent enough time saying that word imagines: dark water and a concrete mouth practicing a sermon about how much it could hold and still be hungry. The car had been persuaded by logic and panic to go where it could not exist; it lay pinned at an angle terribly fond of the exact mistake it had made, and inside were two faces bleached by the light of their own bad luck. The fire truck sat huffing like a tired animal, and the men and women around it moved efficiently inside the choreography they had drilled. A ranger with a rain-faded patch on his shoulder was shouting about upstream and downstream and whether or not we believe in miracles on a Tuesday.\n\nAlec took in the geometry the way his hands had learned to scan a fence line for the lie in its stance. The water ran chest high in the best imagination and over the head of any person who believed in humility. The rope on hand was good but fixed wrong; someone had made lovely knots in the wrong place with the right tenderness. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and he pointed, and no one argued because there wasn\u2019t time and his voice had learned something in the last months about where to find its own authority. He set anchors on railings that had not deserved to be useful and made them swear to God by way of a clove hitch that had seen worse and not complained. He threaded a second line under the first so a person could be a pulley and not a martyr. He tied himself without anyone offering him a dry opinion and looked at a firefighter with eyebrows that asked permission only as a courtesy. The firefighter nodded and put a hand on the rope the way a mother puts a hand on a stroller in traffic\u2014loving and possessive of the right to yank.\n\nHe went into water that tasted like every rusted thing he had considered beautiful at one point in his life and every lie he had believed about his own buoyancy. He went past the edge where a man who has been teaching himself kindness stops going and remembers he was built to be a different tool for ten minutes. He reached the rear of the car and found the glass already broken because someone else had thought ahead and thought right and cut themselves for no good reason except that they were willing. He found hair and the hard curve of a shoulder and a small voice saying I can\u2019t that made him say yes you can in a tone his body had heard in other rooms and obeyed. He did not know their names. He did not ask. He did the one thing he could do\u2014make a knot hold fast around another human\u2019s stubbornness\u2014and then he was pulled in the right direction by competent strangers, which is the closest thing to a religious experience he is willing to admit to.\n\nThey came out of the culvert into light that had the gall to be grey instead of gold. The faces of the people around him arranged themselves into that good shape, the one that is not a smile and not a sob but the place in the middle that means we continue. He went back once more because her husband, or brother, or the man who had promised something he meant at the time, was still trapped by a belt he would have mocked all last week, and he cut it because sometimes safety is a threat when it persists past its usefulness. He did not think he could do it twice. He did it twice. He came up a second time feeling like a rope himself, chafed and mean, and someone caught him under the arms and someone else held his head the way you hold a bird you are about to teach not to die. On the bank, the ranger with the patch that had been at the meeting put a hand on his shoulder and pressed with a pressure that meant both stay and go and said, in the middle of twelve other instructions shouted to the rest of the day, \u201cFence,\u201d and Alec laughed like a man who would cry later in a room by himself or not.\n\nHe did cry, later, because this is a life in which tears happen in rooms that have nothing to do with the reason. He cried in the tack room where the smell of old leather made every decision feel older and wiser than it had been when made. He cried with the dog\u2019s nose at his knee and the sound of rain in the gutters improving no one\u2019s mood. He cried like a man whose hands had finally been formally introduced to his heart, and both had been decent at the meeting.\n\nThat evening, Ruth came up with a bottle of something that had the word rye on it and the look of something that had been distilled by a grandfather who claimed to have learned it in the war. She poured two fingers into cups unworthy of the job and said nothing at first because she is a woman who knows when to stop saving her words. \u201cHeard,\u201d she said at last. \u201cSaw.\u201d She knocked her knuckles against the table like she was impressing good luck into its old wood. \u201cIt won\u2019t always be you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be. But once in a while I\u2019d like it to be. I\u2019d like to live in a county where men who know how to tie knots don\u2019t pretend they only know chores.\u201d He raised his cup without humor and took a sip that made his throat decide whether to forgive him, and it did.\n\nA message came from the south after midnight. It was only a photograph at first\u2014the kind that ocean people take when the light passes through the thin part at the horizon and makes a blue that land doesn\u2019t know how to pronounce. Then, text: \u201cCrossed between islands I did not know had names. Saw water misbehave and behave with equal skill. Heard your county gossip from a pelican. It says you argued with a culvert and won. I am making you a knot when I get back, not for rope, for your wall. I will teach it to remember itself without you. Stay small,\u201d she wrote, and below it, as if her thumb had decided truth needed punctuation, \u201cProud of you, shepherd.\u201d\n\nHe went outside because walls made his skin too careful just then. The stars were doing what they could. The hill smelled like what happens when a long argument ends because both parties remember the other has a right to exist. He put his hand on the post that had the smallest rope burn from the storm and the rescue and thought not of heroism but of repetition, and not of fame but of habit, and of how habit can be the honest version of love if you are stubborn about where you build it. Down in the dark, the new creek held to its course like a vow, and out beyond his hearing the sea wrote its letter to the coast in long hand. He stood in the clean night and let the animal called fear, which he had taught as best he could, come and sit, and then lie down, and then stay. He was, for a minute that did not need measuring, a man inside his life with a dog beside him and rope burns on his hands that would look like nothing tomorrow and feel like everything now, and that was exactly the right size for a god.Chapter 10 did not announce itself; it unfolded the way a good knot does when you pull on the right end\u2014quietly, with a logic that feels like relief. The creek that had moved into the lower pasture decided to keep its new address and stopped arguing at the fence line; it hummed like a sewing machine in the hours when light turns animal. The hill grew the thin green that makes a person think they are generous just for getting out of bed and not stepping on anything too tender. On the first morning of the month, a rabbit sat in the open like confidence with ears and the dog did not chase it because Madrone had begun to understand the difference between a thing you want and a thing you will forgive yourself for wanting later. Alec made coffee that tasted like he had remembered how much water wanted to be involved in small, decent rituals, and he stood by the sink and watched the fog pretend to be smoke and then stop pretending.\n\nHe had never been a man who marked anniversaries properly, but the county had been putting dates on his calendar without asking, and he had learned to read them whether he wanted to or not. He took a length of cotton rope from the hook by the door and set it on the table and smoothed it with the heel of his hand like hair before a photograph. He made a knot in it\u2014not a bowline, which had become a prayer he didn\u2019t say for sport, but a carrick bend whose shameless beauty had been shown to him by a sailor with a tenderness for complicated truths. He flattened it and made sure it sat like a tidy piece of honesty, and then he hung it on a nail by the window where the first slant of morning would find it and then leave it alone. He did not tell anyone he had put it there; he liked the idea of a thing that understood him without asking to be seen.\n\nWork came the way work always does when the weather begins to consider changing its mind; it came in notes tucked under rocks and trucks that eased into the drive and people who stood with their hands in their pockets and their shoulders offering apology in one direction and demand in the other. A man from the county with a green jacket, the one who had written down the names like rare birds, arrived with a smile that had learned to be useful. He brought cones and a sign and two laborers who had opinions about the correct density of gravel and enough patience to listen while the oak told them who had lived here before all of them. Mariah showed up with a shovel and the kind of focus you get when you have recently chosen a side and are still checking your choice against the weather. Ruth stood with her weight on one hip and her braid defiant and told the men where to put the rock and where to keep their boots off the root flare, and the men listened because she had the air of a person who knows the difference between authority and a performance of it in a borrowed coat.\n\nThey filled in the bite the storm had taken with something that would keep the road honest until the county could pretend to afford permanence. Alec ran guide lines from fence post to fence post so that trucks with an exaggerated sense of their own width would behave like models for a day. He handled rope in public now without pretending he had stumbled into its company by mistake; he tied and untied like a person who had made peace with being good at a thing that could make him useful in the kind of way that scares a man into becoming more or less himself. When the day was dull enough to disguise the satisfaction of completion, they stood and looked at the repaired edge, and the rain that threatened and didn\u2019t come hung over them like gossip. Mariah kicked the toe of her boot at the line of gravel where it met earth and said she had brought too little thanks for too large a day. Ruth said the thanks had been in the showing up, and the man in the green jacket nodded because sometimes the truth is so plain it takes three different kinds of hands to make it believable.\n\nShearing came like a drumbeat in the middle of a week that had otherwise decided on whispering. The shearer was a man with a back that had made its agreements long ago; he folded himself to the work with that particular grace that people who are always close to the ground develop and do not show off. The sheep became less themselves and then more; Penny shot him a look she had acquired the previous year, the one that said she did not forgive the negotiation but would resume friendship very soon. Madrone moved slow in the shed and kept her eye in that soft out-of-focus the dog knows how to wear when the animals need to forget there is a predator in the room. The wool came away in living blankets that looked like something a proper god might have been born on, and the lanolin made his hands smell like a promise he could not keep but wanted to try at. He bagged fleeces and laid them out, admiring the way a body makes a map of itself without asking for applause. In the afternoon, he washed with a sliver of homemade soap Ruth had left in his mailbox last spring, and the smell of sheep left him slowly, the way a day leaves your clothes when you had done it right.\n\nHe drove one of the bags down to the bookstore because it turns out a store that sells ideas can also sell the way animals remember winter. Evelyn had, of course, already cleared a corner and put down a sign written in her small, bossy hand: \u201cLocal Wool for People Who Like To Be Warm on Purpose.\u201d She teased him about his sudden confidence with notions, and he told her not to say notions in a town with as many old men as this one, and they laughed until a child with beautiful and impossible hair told them to quiet down so she could listen to the sound the wool made when she touched it. Evelyn\u2019s bruise had faded into a coloration that made her look like a person who had earned a story and was not going to overuse it. The basil plant had accepted winter without complaint and had become the kind of tidy death that makes you like plants again; she had put the pot on a high shelf and stuck in it the plastic fork from a dinner three apartments ago with a note that read \u201cSpring.\u201d He liked the way the word looked, a private dare tucked into ordinary life.\n\nThe memorial for the man the water had taken was what these towns do when they are trying to keep their faces still and useful: a collection of thermoses, a song sung badly and with devotion, a board with photographs that had been printed on a machine that smelled like hot plastic and provided proof of being loved. It happened at the harbor under a sky that had decided to cooperate for once, and the people who kept boats and kept grudges and kept faith all wore their hats either too tight or too loose and no one made a rule about it. Owen gave a speech that started as a denial and became a confession and ended with a joke young enough that it made the old men grab their knees. Hana stood without the armor of irony and read three sentences written in a hand that had been taught to behave by engineering school and ruined by the sea in exactly the right way, and when they said the man\u2019s name the gulls laughed because gulls don\u2019t know anything except how to remind you you are not the center. Alec stayed to the side because the side is where he can see everything without making anyone do the work of noticing him; he accepted paper cups of coffee and nodded at men who needed nods, and when it was over he took a coil no one needed, untied the terrible knots some stranger had made, and put it away right, a private prayer in three motions.\n\nShe wrote from a weather that had decided to allow postcards again. The messages were not long and that made them better; she sent him the name of a town that tasted like dust in his mouth and promised a harbor and delivered a haul-out yard where men swore in two languages and the gossip knit everyone\u2019s mistakes into something almost noble. She sent a picture of a hand\u2014hers, he knew it now by the way the knuckles argued with work\u2014holding a fish scale in sunlight, whole as a coin. She wrote once in a mood he recognized now, the one where leaving has been renamed continuing because no one can survive the drama of it otherwise, and said the engine had finally made a virtue of humility and that Shorty had told a story about a hurricane that sounded like a sermon translated into a better religion. He carried his phone in his shirt pocket, close enough to hear it scold him when it wanted to, and sometimes he brought it out in the orchard and set it on a fence post as if it were a bird he had trained. He spoke out loud less often than he had the month before, but when he did it sounded like the version of him he had decided to protect.\n\nThe creek kept making itself respectable and then reminded him it hadn\u2019t gone to school for it. He went down with a shovel on a day that threatened to be golden and dug a small channel where a ridiculous eddy kept pulling branches into a private conversation; he encouraged the water the way you encourage a child who wants to become opinionated about doorways. He built a footbridge because he had always wanted to and because it was wrong to ask the dog to make a leap every time he needed eggs from the neighbor\u2019s birds. He made it out of salvaged cedar and bolts he had found in an old coffee tin with a label that said \u201cSummer 2004\u201d in a handwriting he didn\u2019t recognize. The first time he walked across it, it made the sound of a polite cough; the second time, it said nothing, which meant it had accepted its purpose. He thought briefly of naming it and then didn\u2019t because names for bridges are like names for tools; the only ones that matter are the names you say when something goes wrong.\n\nHe took more to carrying a small coil looped at his hip like a man in a cartoon he\u2019d promised himself he wouldn\u2019t become and had become anyway. It turned out rope makes strangers into the same kind of person for a while; men who would not otherwise speak asked him how he liked the lay and whether he preferred manila for beauty even though it rots or poly for its soulless stubbornness. He said he liked what worked and then told them why, and the telling made a sound like citizens learning to settle their own disputes without the sheriff. Women asked him to tie things and then watched his hands and then asked him to teach them to tie things, and he did, because he wanted someone to haul him off a plan later without having to give a speech about equality first. He tied a climber\u2019s hitch for a girl on a bicycle whose smile had the problem of being bigger than her face and watched her bind a ridiculous load of cardboard in a way that would make gravity ashamed of itself.\n\nOn a fogless Saturday that had no business pretending to be any other day, a man with a pickup that had almost forgiven the last twenty years of its life pulled in with a trailer and three panels of used hog wire, and it took Alec a second to recognize Owen without the boat under him rearranging his angles. Owen had the look of someone close to salt who has been cheated of it; he stood there blinking as if he\u2019d taken off sunglasses he\u2019d finally learned to wear and did not know where to put his eyes. They shook hands in a way that said I saw you when your mouth was making a strange shape and chose not to punish you for it, and then Owen pretended to need wire cutters and Alec pretended to find some, and they repaired a stupid length of fence that did not need repairing before noon. After, they sat on the tailgate with their feet in the dirt and drank something brown that belonged in better cups. Owen said as little as a man can and still keep a friend, and Alec did not demand more. He learned that the boat had learned a new noise and then another and that both had been wooed into quiet. He learned that the town with the harbor with no patience had the best beans he\u2019d ever eaten and that Marin, who had always taken sun like a woman taking a dare, had acquired a hat she now wore without apology. Owen did not ask about the river or the culvert or what it feels like to make choices in the dark; he stared at the lower pasture and said the new creek looked like it had found work it liked.\n\nHe let himself be within arm\u2019s reach of Evelyn again in ways that would have made him nervous a year ago and now made him proud because fear is an animal you can tack a saddle to if you treat it properly. She came up with a galley book that fell apart in the car and asked for tape, and he watched her find the end of it the way he watched the dog find the scent when scent had gone cruel and he learned nothing from either that he could explain. She had stopped naming the basil plant in a way that made him avoid the window, and she had begun referring to a travel book no one bought as \u201cabsurdly brave,\u201d which made him say quietly that perhaps the book only had a terrible title and she said, fine, all right, perhaps that is what we are all calling it now. They did not talk about the night at the clinic and he did not talk about the culvert, and between those two silences something that had been loose for years quietly learned to sit.\n\nThere were small mercies in the mail and small insults too, because the world is very fond of being thorough. He got an envelope with a return address that looked like a lighthouse and inside was a permit that had learned to approve him and his bridge on a probationary basis; it was signed by a man whose shoes had never seen this dirt, and Alec laughed anyway because wearing a name printed by a bureaucracy feels like being blessed by a bored god. He also got a thin letter from a woman in an office with a photograph of a plant on her desk advising him that his lease would need to be renegotiated by a person who had not yet been hired, with a list of meetings attached that read like tests. He took the letters down to the shed because the shed had become a place where paper surrendered its arrogance; he wrote two drafts of something he needed to say to Mariah and two drafts of something he needed to not say to himself and then went back to the day which did not care about any of it but made provision for his mood in the way the day does when it thinks you are trying in good faith.\n\nOne afternoon that had been assigned to errands and thus improved by being abandoned to work, he found a ewe with a peculiar tilt to her head and an expression that suggested either new hearing or old infection. He took the antibiotics out into the field like a disgrace and delivered the dosage with more apology than medicine can usually tolerate. He sat with her afterward because a person can apologize with their body after they have asked a body to accept the indignity of becoming better. The dog lay in a slump with her chin on her paws and watched the part of the sky where hawks like to browse, and when the ewe stood up and shook in the way a sheep shakes, which makes the animal look as if it is trying to become multiple and failing cheerfully, Alec laughed out loud and did not take it back.\n\nHe did not intend to build a bench, but he built one, because the place by the apples had been hinting for weeks that it was selfish to keep making a person stand. The bench was made out of two halves of something else and a slab that had once believed itself to be a shelf; it was too heavy and not heavy enough, which is a respectable way to be a seat. He placed it where the branches would know the weight of someone thinking, and he sat and discovered that from here you could see the place where the ridge blacked against the sea on days when the fog was in a generous mood, and on other days you could see nothing but the interior of a thought and the way the dog checked back every third minute in case sitting had become distress. He imagined people who were not him sitting here when he was not here; he pictured Ruth\u2019s niece with her arms folded in calculation and Owen with salt in his eyebrows again in a season where the boat had returned, and Evelyn with a book, reading out loud by accident when the sentence in front of her surprised her into lending it her mouth. He pictured Marin with her hat in her hands because the wind is a thief even in this little hollow and only thieves treat thieves well.\n\nThe fox came back and did what foxes do, which is to sit in the boundary between ownership and accident and pretend to ignore you while being very interested indeed. Madrone regarded the fox with the respect one professional gives another, and Alec took his hands out of his pockets because he had recently learned that his hands have better manners when they are allowed to make themselves useful. He checked the garlic and found it too confident by half, which pleased him; he pinched back the flower heads and felt the plant insist on its project anyway, which is the only way anything earns your respect. The beans he had told to give up months ago sent one last green question mark into the air and he answered it with a laugh and a thumb and a promise that he would give it its due in the spring when the soil decided to accept liberally again.\n\nSometimes the sea disappeared for days in his head, and he decided this was health and not neglect. It came back in noises that had arranged themselves into meaning without his asking. It came back in a gull flung resembled less a bird than a brag. It came back in a call from Owen who rarely called, because calling is a naked act and men who have been cold do not undress easily. \u201cLa Paz,\u201d he said, and Alec could hear the beginning of a smile that had not asked permission. \u201cThey have a band that plays every song as if it is about the moon, and the moon agrees to the arrangement. She ate something that claimed to be ceviche and was not, and did not complain like a child for once. We are going to fix a thing that isn\u2019t yet broken and I am going to pretend it\u2019s about prudence.\u201d Alec said he hoped for fairgoing and that if Owen saw a man with a tattoo of a shrimp reading a book to a cat, he should not follow him, and Owen swore in a pleased way and said it was good to have a person who knew how to lie properly into a telephone.\n\nWord went around that a kid from up the road had begun to come by at dusk to pat the sheep and explain to them about letters, and Alec decided that children talking to animals about the alphabet was either nonsense or the exact way to develop a better county in fifteen years. He watched the boy, who had the posture of an apology and a laugh like someone had already given him permission to be proud, and he said nothing. He let the teaching happen and made sure the gate was shut behind it, and when the boy went home with his hair static and the dog following him half to the road, Alec stood for a minute and practiced being grateful without making a ceremony of it.\n\nThe first blossom on the earliest apple opened without noise and with the kind of nerve only small things get away with. He bent to it and inhaled in a way that made sense to his mother\u2019s ghost and probably to no one else, and he tasted a sweetness that had nothing to do with courtship and everything to do with effort. He did not text the picture to anyone, which was a new privacy he did not bother to compliment himself for; he held it with his eyes and then put it down where he knew he would find it later, the way a person puts down a tool they will need when the light has gone and the hands expect to be guided.\n\nHe set himself to learning two new knots because there is no virtue in sticking with the ones that have recently saved you. He learned a constrictor knot because it is what you use when you want to say no without a speech and to be believed, and he learned a zeppelin bend because what an arrogant name, and because sometimes you tie two ends that don\u2019t want to admit they are equal and you have to make them shake hands. He practiced on the bench and on the kitchen chair and around the leg of the table with the gouge in it from a night ten years ago that had not gone well; he practiced on the fence post by the old oak until his fingers could make the pattern without him looking, and then he left the rope there in a lazy curve and went to check the salt lick because leaving work on purpose is a way of saying you respect the animal of yourself that never, ever clocks out.\n\nOn a morning when birds tried on their spring voices like suits in a mirror and kept some and put others back, he found Mariah at the orchard with a notebook and a face that suggested she had made a list she was embarrassed to share. She told him her cousin had called twice and had used the phrase \u201chighest and best use\u201d like a clean towel to wipe his hands on after dirtying them with imagination. She said she had thought for a day and a night and half the next day and had come up here to see how garlic complicates a person\u2019s positions. She said that the highest use of a place might be the slowest use, and that she had begun to inventory the kinds of wealth that still work if the power goes out, and he did not congratulate her because a body making up its mind deserves not to be clapped for while it does it. He pointed out where the creek had decided to be and the way the trees had accepted the new grammar without whining, and he asked her to sit, and she did, and the bench did not complain; it held both their weight and the weight of the part of the conversation that will probably always be heavier than two people are good for.\n\nHe tried the bridge in the dark because bridges ought to pass their own tests. He took the dog and a flashlight and the kind of attention you spend like currency when a day wants a premium. The creek spoke in full sentences now and said rude things about erosion and the way humans behave with tools, and he listened without thinking he could improve the water\u2019s manners. They crossed, dog first and then man, and on the way back the sky broke open just enough to show him a gap through which something bright reminded him that even in months when the sea stays far in the ear, a person has access to light. He turned off the flashlight and stood very still and let his body discover how valuable a small motion can be when the rest of the world is finally in its chair.\n\nHe woke to the smell of a letter from the south before he heard the phone do its little cough. She had sent a photograph of a fish scale again, this one balanced on the back of her hand in a way that made him want to ask the world whether it would mind holding still another minute. She wrote, \u201cI watched a man tie a bend with his eyes closed because the light was too honest and he didn\u2019t want to embarrass himself in front of his own hands. I thought of your bench. I thought of the hill. Tell the dog there are pelicans who are trying to become dogs and need supervision.\u201d He wrote back, \u201cDog reports readiness to inspect pelicans for intention. Bridge holds. Garlic brags. County making a face like a man who\u2019s agreed to do better. Stay small,\u201d and she answered, \u201cNothing else fits,\u201d and sent a picture of a hat hung on a bulkhead like a temporary flag.\n\nHe did not miss the shape of crisis, which is worrisome, and he said so to the dog, who stared back and licked her nose because dogs know that language is a leash and a bone and a promise to get it right next time. He missed the attention he had learned to pay, and so he found new ways to pay it: by being first to the gate in the morning and last to the sink at night, by counting his posts without letting repetition become a narcotic, by teaching the boy from up the road how to coil rope in an oval and not a circle because different shapes keep different memories. He allowed boredom to flirt with him and then told it he was busy, and boredom, being dignified in its way, found someone else.\n\nThe fox left two prints on the step and a leaf as if delivering late mail. A coyote sang behind the shed in a voice that made him think of first wives and promises that had been made in a tone entirely correct for the moment and wrong for the year. He sent a bag of apples, the last, down to the harbor with a note that said \u201cfor hands and for Shorty\u2019s bad temper,\u201d and he got back a photograph of a loaf that had no right to be that proud in that weather and he could smell it through the screen for a minute and no more. The whales made themselves uncertain again and then very certain and then went on, because creatures with good maps don\u2019t need you to clap for them.\n\nHe found himself in the shed one afternoon when the light made every spider web a criticism and every tool a confession, and he picked up the rope from the hook and tied two lengths together and then untied them again and again until he felt his breath stop arguing. He thought maybe heroism was a scarecrow he had been asked to stand up in a field that didn\u2019t need one, and maybe what he had instead was the kind of decency that gets built into ligaments by repetition. He thought of a boat moving south with a woman on it who knew how to make a knot behave, and he thought of a bookstore where a woman he had not yet learned how to be useful to in all the necessary ways nonetheless let him carry a box without comment. He thought of a county that would keep coming to his door because it had learned his name and his habit of answering even when he should not, and he reminded himself to sit on the bench and feel the wood threaten to go soft one day and that there is no insult in that.\n\nToward the end of the month the hills went the particular green that makes you reckless, and the old men at the auction yard began telling the same jokes they\u2019d told last year, which is what passes for liturgy in a place where lots of things still have to be done by hand. He drove down to the pier on a weekday no one had thought to decorate with a holiday and stood at the end with his palms on the rail and his eyes trying to see beyond the place where sight likes to submit. The water had a face like a person who has learned to share a house and still insists on rearranging the furniture. A gull landed nearby with the confidence of a councilman and eyed his pockets in case any of them had decided to become fish. Alec had nothing for the bird and the bird had nothing for him except its refusal to be ashamed of wanting; it was a fair trade.\n\nOn his way back up he stopped at a hardware store that had never forgiven itself for letting you find anything on the first try and bought a handful of bolts and two lengths of chain and a little brass bell he told himself was for the gate so he would stop spending afternoons wondering whether it was open. He put the bell up that evening while the dog hunted for frogs with the careful enthusiasm of an amateur, and when the wind pushed through in its mild evening personality and the bell made its practical sound, he felt the day settle the way a dog settles before sleep\u2014two turns, a sigh, a set of small adjustments no one has any right to criticize.\n\nHe slept unevenly that night and woke twice thinking he had left something alive in the wrong place. He got up both times and went out with a flashlight and found exactly what should have been where it should have been, which did not cure the habit but allowed it to feel less powerful. On the second waking, the sky was so full of stars it looked like a fabric he had seen once in a shop full of dresses he could not afford for a person he had not married, and he laughed in the yard because history sometimes shows up dressed in clothes you thought you\u2019d burned. The creek spoke less like a lecture now and more like an old person who is making sense only if you know them well, and he did, so it did, and he went back in and slept until the dog pawed his shoulder to say it was morning.\n\nThe day that showed up next looked like nothing from a distance and like everything up close, which is, if he was being honest, the kind of day he had once fled. He made a sandwich and a list and left the list on the table and took the sandwich out to the bench and ate it while a bee disrespected the rules and worked in a blossom it had not paid to get into. He put his hand on the knot hanging by the window when he went back inside because it had started to feel like a bell rope inside his chest\u2014pull, and the day sings; leave it, and the day hums anyway. He looked around the small room where his life had the nerve to be happening well and thought, briefly and accurately, that he was being allowed to stay. He told the rope thank you and did not tell anyone he had said it, and he went out to put his hands where the land had insisted they go when he signed that paper under the cabinet a year ago, which turned out to be the best handwriting he possessed.",

                              "content": "Before the first light smudged the edges of the coast, Alec was already out among the sheep with a thermos of cheap coffee and a fleece he\u2019d pulled from the nail in the tack room. Fog lay in folds over the mid-slope, as if the hills had thrown blankets up to their chins and were pretending to sleep. He rubbed his hands together, breath pluming, and listened to the invisible Pacific pounding somewhere beyond the eucalyptus and the pale rise of grass. The smell of salt drifted inland on a slow wind, furled with the ammoniacal sweetness of the flock and the mineral damp of dew. He spoke softly into it all, to the dog, to the wary ewes and lambs, to himself.\n\n\"Easy,\" he said, though nothing was happening. \"We got time.\"\n\nHe\u2019d never thought he\u2019d end up shepherding. That was a story for people with a family tract and a bible of irrigations, not a boy who\u2019d left San Luis at nineteen to forget one thing after another. Yet here he was, on a leased patch outside Cayucos, where grass grew brittle in summer and washed back into luminous green by January, and where the year buckled itself around the tides and the market price per head. He had a decent eye for sick animals and a better hand with fences. The rest he\u2019d learned by listening to old men at the auction yard, by making mistakes and then quietly doing something harder the morning after.\n\nThe dog\u2019s name was Madrone, a rust-bellied mix with a solemn intelligence, and she ghosted at his heel until he sent her wide. \"Keep \u2019em tight, Mo.\" She swung like a hinge, and the sheep drew together with the reluctance of sleepy schoolchildren.\n\nWhen the sun finally nudged up, it cut through the fog and made it luminous, layers of milk and gold. The fence line along the eastern boundary ran down toward a dry arroyo and then back up toward his house, a low-slung barn swallow of a building that had once been a shack for pickers. Before he\u2019d leased, a realtor had shown him listings with ocean views and banked decks, all the predictable glass. He\u2019d said no, feeling strange even as he said it. He wanted this: the smell of dirt that had been turned over, a roof that could peel back shingle by shingle until he relearned weather.\n\nBelow the house, an acre or so of ground lay stubborn and matted with fennel and bristly ox-tongue, a piece he\u2019d promised himself he\u2019d fix \"next week\" for three months. He imagined rows of brassicas, a little pocket of kitchen herbs, whatever didn\u2019t roll over and die when the north wind got personal. But his hands always ended up with hay twine in them instead of seeds. He had an agreement with the landowner to tend the old apple trees along the driveway too, which had suffered from someone\u2019s bright idea to let the grass grow tall around them. He\u2019d meant to learn about pruning angles and was instead learning how to drink coffee at one in the morning without noticing it.\n\nHe finished the pass along the low pasture and stood with his palm on the fence post, feeling the vibration of Madrone\u2019s body as the dog pressed against him for praise. The road was still except for a single pickup moving slow as a prayer, and beyond it the ocean, a flat bruise.\n\nBy eight the fog had climbed to a high ceiling and turned thin. He was in the lower garden with a borrowed spade, cutting along the border to see if he could coax it into a shape that didn\u2019t look like a crime scene. His phone buzzed in his pocket and he ignored it, thinking it might be a feed delivery, or his vet, or someone selling something. It stopped. Started again. Stopped.\n\nA voice carried down the drive, unexpectedly close. \"You Alec?\"\n\nHe looked up, blinking, and the woman on the other side of the fence raised her hat in lieu of a handshake. She had the kind of hat people wore in old pictures: straw, frayed, a blood-orange ribbon threaded through the crown. Her hair was tucked under it, but a wing of it had come loose at her temple. Her jeans were scuffed, her shirt was printed with lemons that had faded to ghost-citrus. She was not young-but-old, or old-but-young; she had that look people who\u2019ve worked outside get, as if the air had carved them a little.\n\n\"I am,\" he said, pushing the spade into the soil with the side of his boot. \"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" she said. \"I\u2019m Marin.\"\n\n\"Like the county?\"\n\n\"Like the sea.\" She rested her forearms on the top rail, making the boards creak. The air around her smelled like wet rosemary and wood smoke, and he realized she\u2019d carried it with her, not the morning carrying it for her. \"I heard you were looking. For someone to smack your weeds around. A gardener.\" She said the last word in a different tone, half teasing, as if it were something you bought at a roadside stand.\n\nHe wiped his hand on his jeans and offered it, and she took it without flinching. \"I am,\" he admitted. \"Or I was, and then I started to believe maybe the weeds were winning and that this was their land anyway.\"\n\n\"They do that,\" she said. \"It makes them happy, you know, the lying down in mass graves.\" She pointed with her chin at the fennel and the burrs and the scutch grass that had thrummed up overnight, or so it seemed. \"This is honest soil. It just wants you to understand what it\u2019s capable of.\"\n\nThat made him smile, despite himself. \"How\u2019d you hear?\"\n\n\"Maya, at South Bay Nurseries. I worked there a while, through winter. She said you were the shepherd with a soft spot for apples and a sore back.\"\n\n\"Maya,\" he said, with an involuntary fondness. She\u2019d given him two ragged flats of kale like a blessing and told him the secret to avocados was not to try to raise them in an argument with the wind. \"I do have a sore back.\"\n\n\"Let me walk it,\" Marin said. \"I don\u2019t do chemicals. I get mad at Roundup like it did something to me personally. I do hand weeding, sheet mulching, tricks, conversation, sometimes music if the dirt wants it. I like being paid in cash, we can be grown-ups about it. I work Wednesdays elsewhere and I\u2019m at the harbor on Fridays, so Mondays and Thursdays for you if you like me. I have references. I saw your apples, by the way; the short answer is, those need a day and a ladder and someone unafraid of metaphor. The long answer is, oh boy.\"\n\n\"The harbor,\" he said. \"You sail?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\" She shrugged. \"I like looking at lines. I help with a little boat that needs always fixing. Don\u2019t look at me like that. It\u2019s almost; it\u2019s almost not stupid.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of the ocean,\" he said, though he\u2019d been thinking of her mouth when she said almost, the way certain words tilted the corners of her lips. He was not a man who studied mouths.\n\n\"Well, that too. It\u2019s big. Sometimes it\u2019s blue. I\u2019m Marin, like I said. You are\u2026 what did Maya say\u2026 Alec-of-the-hills.\"\n\n\"She did not say that,\" he said, alarmed.\n\n\"She did,\" Marin reported, delighted. \"In her inside voice. Listen. Pay me sixty-five an hour. Pay me seventy when it\u2019s trees because I don\u2019t like arguing with ladders. I\u2019ll bring a truck and tools, because yours look like they have feelings and I don\u2019t want to hurt them.\"\n\n\"You didn\u2019t ask me if I was going to hire you.\"\n\n\"That would be assuming no,\" she said. \"And I don\u2019t like living in futures that don\u2019t want me.\" Then her face went a little softer, the joke taking its coat off. \"I need work, and I like land that\u2019s been looked at honestly. You didn\u2019t put in fake lawn. You didn\u2019t call it a lawn ironically and then it turns out to be fake-corn in spring and fake-snow in winter. You put fence up yourself; see how this nail bends. You care. So I want to work here. I want to get dirt under my nails and say hello to the dog and not get yelled at for drinking water on the job.\"\n\n\"Pay at the end of the day,\" he said, as if he were laying a board on firm supports. \"Cash is fine. I should probably look at references. Not because. You know. But because.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Write this number down. There\u2019s a woman named Esperanza, over in Los Osos. I took a yard of oxalis and made it cry, she\u2019ll tell you. There\u2019s also a guy named Wyatt who thinks I\u2019m a witch. He\u2019ll tell you that too. It\u2019s because I talk to his squash.\"\n\n\"I talk to my sheep,\" he said. \"We\u2019ll get along.\"\n\nShe cut him a look then, one of those starboard-tilting looks, amused and measuring, and then she took her hat off and wiped her forehead with the back of her wrist. Her hair came down a little. It was brown, and in it there was a streak of something like iron, or a mistake.\n\n\"Can you start now?\" he asked. He heard himself, the eagerness in it, and immediately wanted the ground to take him down a rung.\n\n\"I can,\" she said. \"Give me an hour, though. I left a trowel in my van and the van in Morro Bay, which is a long story involving a bird and a piece of toast.\" She tipped the hat back on. \"Tomorrow then? Seven? It\u2019s cooler. And I get to watch your dog take himself seriously.\"\n\nHe agreed to seven. After she\u2019d gone, the place felt like it had inhaled and then held it, waiting.\n\nHe spent the afternoon cutting thistle by the arroyo and hauled out three stumps he\u2019d promised the landowner he\u2019d deal with before last month\u2019s rent. He ate a sandwich over the sink, watching the ceiling fan stutter. The phone buzzed again. He looked: Evelyn. He swung his thumb over the accept button and then he didn\u2019t. He set the phone down, picked it up, took his breath like a drink and hit call.\n\n\"You finally alive?\" she said. He could hear her smile, the old one, the one she had used to soften everything from a traffic ticket to a too-brutal truth.\n\n\"Been alive all day,\" he said. \"How are you, Evie.\"\n\n\"You don't call me that,\" she said. It was automatic. Not unkind. They were in the tender place after a divorce where labels were suddenly knives handed to children. \"Sorry. You can. I have a thing I need. If you\u2019re willing.\"\n\n\"What kind of thing.\"\n\n\"Paperwork,\" she said. \"Dried hell. The registration for the Subaru, because you\u2019re still listed, and the DMV is what it is. If you could sign something without bleeding, I would be grateful. I can come up. I know the dog will roll over and pretend he\u2019s never met me, but I\u2019ll bring something stinky.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m here,\" he said. \"Tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"At\u2026?\"\n\n\"Seven,\" he said, and then he flinched. \"Seven-thirty? Eight? I\u2019ll be around. Early is okay.\"\n\n\"Alec,\" she said quietly, and he was suddenly terrified of what she might say next. But she went somewhere else. \"You\u2019re eating?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re not making Max eat beans out of a can.\"\n\n\"Max is a dog,\" he said. It was stupid, and they both laughed a little, the way once in a while the body laughs to show the heart what walking could be like. \"Come when you like. There\u2019ll be coffee. The cheap stuff.\"\n\n\"We drink cheap coffee now?\"\n\n\"I drink it at all hours,\" he said. \"The sheep don\u2019t care.\"\n\n\"Sheep never did care,\" she agreed, and then they fell silent in a way that was kind of a blessing. \"See you,\" she said, and hung up before either of them could do anything wrong.\n\nThat night, he lay awake on the couch, not because his bed was uncomfortable, but because the couch faced the window and the window was a rectangle of black that held in it the idea of the sea. Sometimes, late, he turned off every light and walked out to the fence line and listened to the whales when they came through, hearing them as rumors the water told the air. You could pick out something exquisite from the emptiness if you stood still long enough. He did not do that tonight. He stared at the shadow shapes until they softened and brightened, until dawn came and the dog nosed his knee and said in her useless, beautiful way, hey.\n\nHe had the kettle on when Marin\u2019s van pulled in, a white beater with a dangling mirror and a new tire. She jumped out as if she had been thrown by something glad. Madrone went to meet her as if they\u2019d been planning this reunion for weeks. In five minutes Marin had set up her tools along the fence: a fork, a long hoe, a coil of drip line like a sleeping snake, a bundle of cardboard cut into sheets.\n\n\"Today we\u2019re going to make your weeds think twice,\" she announced, rubbing her palms together as if she were about to install a heart in a whale. \"We\u2019re going to feed your soil. We\u2019re going to inflate your sense of possibility. Shall we.\"\n\nHe watched her work. You could learn a person by the way they moved one thing to make space for another. She knelt and pushed her hand under the mat of grass like someone reaching under a bed. She lifted it like a rug, laughing breathlessly when it gave, and the smell that came up was dark and mushroomy. She layered cardboard, soaked it, laid wood chips, adjusted the hose as if it were a living thing with preferences. She hummed under her breath. Not a song he recognized. Something made of three notes and a path between them.\n\n\"You should plant broad beans here,\" she said, pointing with her elbow. \"Let them do your heavy lifting. Let them flirt with the earth.\"\n\n\"Is that a phrase you can use,\" he asked, \"with beans.\"\n\n\"If I can talk to someone\u2019s squash, yes.\"\n\nAt eight-thirty, Evelyn\u2019s car came up the driveway, and Marin stood, shading her eyes, and Alec felt, in the slop of his chest, something like childhood panic. The old life meeting the new. The two parts of himself who did not share language except in the way bodies face each other, reluctantly, with honor.\n\nEvelyn got out with a manila folder and nothing else. She had cut her hair short since he\u2019d last seen her, and it made her neck look like something out of a painting. She wore a knitted sweater the color of over-steeped tea, and it made her skin look like something a person might take care of. She held herself in check until she saw Madrone, and then she crouched and the dog washed her hands with her tongue and whirled against her, thudding, whining in that way dogs have that sounds like a complaint and is not.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said, looking up at him, not getting up yet. \"You look like you\u2019ve been eating. Which is good.\"\n\n\"You look like someone who goes inside to make a phone call,\" he said, which was something she used to say to him when he had tested the limits of network coverage more than the limits of patience. He bent down too, rubbed the dog\u2019s neck, his hand bumping into hers and then not. \"This is Marin. She\u2019s\u2014\" He hesitated, aware of the oddness of the introduction. Boss? Worker? Another word, older than both of those, not appropriate in the place they were.\n\n\"Gardening,\" Marin supplied, standing and dusting her knees. \"I mean, staring at dirt and telling it stories until it agrees to still be dirt.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Evelyn said, straightening. \"I\u2019m Ev\u2014. I\u2019m Evelyn. Hi. This place\u2026 looks. It looks good. It really does.\" She was careful, and he was grateful. She handed him the folder. \"Sign where the tabs are. I brought each page because last time we guessed wrong.\"\n\nHe took the papers into the kitchen because the wind at the edge of the day was busy with them and they could turn the world into confetti in a minute. Evelyn followed, and Marin stayed out with the dog, bending a hose around her forearm like a lasso.\n\n\"Do you want coffee?\" he asked.\n\n\"I\u2019m a little jittery,\" she said. \"I had a dentist appointment and then I didn\u2019t go. Because I\u2019m a child. Sorry. You don\u2019t need to hear that.\" She leaned against the counter. \"I heard you lost a ewe last week. Maya told me. Sorry. Is that appropriate? I\u2019m sorry about you losing a sheep. This is not a greeting I ever imagined practicing, but here we are.\"\n\n\"It happens,\" he said, and the words were stones that fell cleanly without making a new dent in the earth. \"You learn to respect weakness without letting it run the show. You learn to watch.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I am trying to learn.\"\n\nHe signaled the line with a finger, and she heard the old language in it and handed him a pen without looking. He signed twice. She said thank you in a tone that was almost nothing, but that had in it a small room with a chair. A place to rest.\n\n\"Who\u2019s the gardener?\" she asked, after a minute. \"She\u2019s\u2026\"\n\n\"She\u2019s Marin. She knows everything about dirt. She has opinions about beans. She talks to squash. She works at the harbor on Fridays.\"\n\n\"The harbor.\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t start,\" he said, unexpectedly flushed. \"I don\u2019t mean. She\u2019s a person. I hired a person.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Evelyn said, her face perfect. \"You should. Hire as many people as you need. You\u2019ve always needed a crew. You think you\u2019re a lone cowboy because you watched movies on Saturday afternoons and then went for drives without telling anyone where you were going, but you need people. Just\u2014\" She stopped. Something like pain crossed her face, very fast, like a shadow of a fast bird. \"Just be careful with your heart, okay? It\u2019s made of the same stuff as everyone else\u2019s. Despite your theories.\"\n\n\"Hypothesis,\" he said, because he was a fool. \"It was a hypothesis.\"\n\nShe laughed despite herself, and the laugh did something to his insides that was both good and terrible. \"Sign the back too,\" she said. And then, more gently: \"She\u2019ll be good for the place. It looks, already. I don\u2019t know. Different. Like the land knows you\u2019re watching.\"\n\n\"You always say things like that.\"\n\n\"I happen to believe we are observed. By the things we own or think we own. And by the things we can\u2019t see.\" She held the pen for a second longer than was necessary before sliding it into her sweater pocket. \"Do you need anything? Money? No? You\u2019ll tell me, right?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he lied, and then didn\u2019t.\n\nThey went back outside. Marin had built a low wall of mulch and cardboard like an altar. She showed him the way to tuck the edges in. She showed him how the soil felt when you stopped fighting it. Evelyn stood by, her hands in her pockets, watching with the careful, deliberate interest of someone who had left and was still allowed to be here. It was awkward as rain on a wedding day. It was also exactly the right weather for what was happening.\n\n\"I should go,\" Evelyn said, when Marin stood and stretched and the dog flopped under the apple tree and became a long yellow line. \"It\u2019s a long drive and I forgot breakfast.\"\n\n\"Do you want a peach?\" Marin asked. \"I have a peach. It\u2019s not good. It\u2019s a little mealy. It\u2019s honest about it, though. You can have it anyway.\"\n\n\"I have this thing about peaches,\" Evelyn said, smiling. \"They taste like promises. I break promises with my teeth. Thank you but no.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" Marin said, and took a bite that left her with juice on her chin. She wiped it with the back of her hand and looked like a child for exactly a second. She turned to the tree and said, with complete seriousness, \"Paper around your trunk. You\u2019ll feel better.\"\n\n\"She talks to trees,\" Evelyn whispered, as if this required him to be at risk, and Alec felt a surprising anger rise, then pass.\n\n\"She listens to them too,\" he whispered back.\n\nThey said goodbye in the driveway in increments. Evelyn put her hand out to shake Marin\u2019s and Marin held it with both of hers like she was reading something through skin.\n\n\"If you need help with anything green at your place, I do community rates for ex-wives and nieces and people who have thin dogs,\" Marin said. \"I like making things more livable. It\u2019s my fatal flaw, besides rocks.\"\n\n\"I live in a small apartment with a basil plant that hates me,\" Evelyn confessed. \"If I hire you, it will be to talk to it so it stops singing my failures back to me.\"\n\n\"Ah, basil,\" Marin said gravely. \"The most judgmental herb.\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" Evelyn said, and they both laughed, and Alec had to put his hands in his pockets to keep himself from reaching out to both of them in different old and new ways. When Evelyn drove away, she rolled down her window and threw him a waiter\u2019s wave, a flick of two fingers off the steering wheel. He took it. He let it stick to him.\n\nHe turned back to the yard. Marin had peeled off her flannel and tied it around her waist. There was a tattoo on her forearm he hadn\u2019t noticed: a small boat, almost a child\u2019s drawing, nothing dramatic\u2014but it had ropes and a little mast and a black edge to its hull like a promise. The word under it was almost unreadable. He squinted. Not a name. Two words.\n\nShe caught him looking. \"It\u2019s fine,\" she said. \"People can look. It\u2019s only a story I wrote once and then had to put somewhere.\"\n\n\"What does it say.\"\n\n\"It says \u2018stay small\u2019.\"\n\n\"People always tell you to dream big.\"\n\n\"They do,\" she said, bending to fix the hose. \"And it breaks too many hands.\"\n\nThey worked until the sun was high and the fog had burned off and the sheep had moved into an area that had nothing left to recommend it. At noon he made sandwiches and they ate sitting on the low back step with their feet in the dirt. Without intending to, he asked her what brought her to the harbor.\n\n\"A boat,\" she said, through bread. \"A ketch with a soft deck and a loud engine that\u2019s in love with the attention it needs. Some of us are fixing her. Some of us only pretend to. The man who owns her says we\u2019ll see Mexico by winter. The sea says: we\u2019ll see about that.\" She drank water straight from the hose. \"I like working with what keeps trying to kill you. Very polite. Very true. Also I like the way rope feels when you coil it right. The way a knot, a good knot, remembers itself.\"\n\n\"You leave Fridays,\" he said. \"You come back.\"\n\n\"I come back,\" she said, and then her eyes did something: flickered away and back. \"I have some things in storage. I have a plant that needs me to say the names of its hallways. I have debts and a dog I don't have and a hunk of land now that is going to give me a stomach muscle. I have whatever this is. If I leave, I\u2019ll tell you. I won\u2019t let your apples wake up to a stranger.\"\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t asking,\" he said. He was.\n\n\"I know,\" she said. After a minute: \"You were married.\"\n\n\"I was.\"\n\n\"A long time?\"\n\n\"Long enough to make the hardest mistakes. Not long enough to fix them.\"\n\nShe nodded and ate slowly. She didn\u2019t tell him it would be different with her. She didn\u2019t say anything that made a promise where none could live. She said, \"Watch your step,\" when the dog rolled over into the path like a log.\n\nThe afternoon was a soft ache of work. They built an edge to the garden with scavenged bricks and a patience that felt like prayer. Marin taught him how to plant garlic by tucking each clove into the soil as if it were sleeping. She asked him the names of his sheep and he pretended he didn\u2019t name them and then said two anyway: Penny. Star.\n\n\"You are too sentimental for ranching,\" she said, gently.\n\n\"I\u2019m a shepherd,\" he corrected. \"Which means sentiment is my only tool besides fences and hope.\"\n\nAt three, a wind came up the canyon that was scented with wildfire even though there wasn\u2019t one, not that day. The summer before, smoke had made everything look like a bad dream. He looked at the hills the way you look at a sleeping baby with a fever. Marin looked too. She put her hand on his forearm without thinking, then took it away as if she\u2019d behaved badly.\n\n\"Sorry. I\u2014\"\n\n\"It\u2019s fine,\" he said. It was better than fine. It was a hand. It was a thing in the world that said you exist.\n\nShe turned away and picked up the fork and went on doing battle with the burdock. He watched her shoulders. He wanted to say something about the sea she liked, and the way it accrued all our leaving. He wanted to tell her about the night he\u2019d driven to Big Sur in a storm and slept in the cab of his truck, listening to rain like a riot on the roof, and how sometimes he still dreamed of that roof failing. He didn\u2019t say any of it. He told her instead to watch out for the sprinkler head over there by the rock. She said thank you. That was enough for then.\n\nBy evening, the rough lines of a garden had emerged: beds that logic could walk into, a path that didn\u2019t fight you. He paid her in cash and she counted it once and then tucked it into the front pocket of her jeans without ceremony. She took a plastic bag with some rosemary and a handful of figs. She leaned against the van and tilted her head.\n\n\"We did good,\" she said. \"Better than good. The dirt is less angry with us. Your apples are simmering down. And you, shepherd? You look like you slept while your body was awake.\"\n\n\"I feel like I\u2019ve been seen by\u2026 something,\" he said. \"An animal I want to know the name of.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s just work,\" she said, though her eyes were soft. \"It\u2019s the only god I got.\"\n\nShe left, and the air seemed to unbutton itself into evening. He poured dry food into Madrone\u2019s bowl and then stood at the sink and ate half a fig straight from the tree, the sweetness intrusive after a day of salt and dirt. The phone buzzed again. He looked. Unknown number. He let it ring out.\n\nLater, after he\u2019d made his one good thing\u2014black beans with garlic and some kind of pepper he\u2019d bought at the market because the man who\u2019d grown it had a story\u2014and after he\u2019d walked the fence line and once more admired the neat edges they\u2019d made, he sat on the porch with a beer and watched the sky lay down and tuck itself in. Stars came late on the coast when the fog stayed, and early when it didn\u2019t. Tonight they came one by one like someone arriving to a party with perfect timing.\n\nHe thought of Evelyn\u2019s face, and the way she had watched Marin with an amazement that had nothing to do with jealousy and everything to do with disbelief in her own continued ability to be surprised by other people. He thought of Marin\u2019s tattoo. Stay small. He thought of the sea beyond the ridge and the man who said Mexico by winter. He thought of knots remembering themselves. He had once believed love to be a knot like that. Maybe it was. Maybe you just had to give it slack and time and the right palm to run it through.\n\nHe fell asleep in the chair, his head tilted back, mouth open. He woke cold and went inside. He dreamed of fences becoming water and sheep swimming, their eyes like little planets, calm.\n\nIn the morning, the cardboard had started to drink the world. He knelt in the damp and pressed his hand flat on it the way you might put a palm to someone\u2019s forehead to check for fever. He felt heat, the heat of decomposition, and it delighted him in a way that felt childish, shameless.\n\nAround eleven, when the air was already a cupped hand of heat, a truck came up the drive too fast. He stood, alarmed, wiping dirt on his thigh. It wasn\u2019t a truck; he corrected himself. It was a boat of a car with a hood big enough to sleep on, the paint oxidized into a lizard skin of red and pale. The driver door opened with a sound, and a man stepped out with grey in his hair and a coat too heavy for the season. He had hands that had spent time on rope. He had the practiced squint of people who measure distances in waves.\n\n\"You Alec?\" the man asked. It was becoming the refrain of his week.\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m Owen,\" the man said. \"Friend of Marin. She thought maybe you\u2019d have a second for an old fool with a gasket problem.\"\n\nAlec blinked. \"On the\u2026 car?\"\n\n\"On the boat,\" the man said, pointing behind him, and only then did Alec see, cresting the hill like a wrong moon, the mast of a ketch strapped to a flatbed. It was ridiculous. It was also somehow right.\n\n\"We\u2019re bringing her over to a man with a shop who owes me two favors,\" Owen said. \"She didn\u2019t want to go without saying hello to the land that\u2019s paying for her varnish.\"\n\nAlec said something like, \"Ah,\" and then found English again. \"She can come say hello. I have no varnish but I have water.\"\n\nOwen grinned, and it made him younger. \"That will do. Marin told me you\u2019re the shepherd. That you listen.\"\n\n\"I try.\"\n\n\"Good. Boats need that.\"\n\nThey walked up to the flatbed and the boat, high out of water, seemed both proud and embarrassed, like a ballet dancer at the grocery store in costume. Alec put his hand on the hull without thinking and it was warm as a body. He felt, in his palm, the steady, patient courage of a thing built to move. He understood for a moment something he had never cared to understand about people who go away from shore on purpose.\n\n\"She\u2019s leaving in the fall,\" Owen said, as if this were the part of the conversation Alec had signed up for. \"God willing and the creek don\u2019t rise. We\u2019ll need hands. Marina tells me you\u2019ve got strong ones.\"\n\n\"Marin,\" Alec corrected, because the specificity mattered. \"I have sheep.\"\n\n\"So you do,\" Owen said. \"And sometimes the thing you tend tells you who you are. Sometimes it ate your mother, and you keep feeding it anyway. Come down to the harbor Friday. Just to look. You can put your hand on something that has failed and then fixed itself.\"\n\nAlec said he would, which meant he would go and he would stand with his hands in his pockets and stare at ropes and gulls and the ribs of boats and wonder what possessed him. The boat tilted slightly on the flatbed as if to nod to him. Owen got back in the big car and swung it\u2014gently now\u2014back toward the road. Madrone chased it for exactly ten yards and then sat down as if to say, okay, enough.\n\nHe texted Marin after, a message that said: Your boat came up to flirt with my hill. She sent back: She does that. Then: Friday. Come and I\u2019ll buy you a fish taco that will make you change your religion.\n\nHe typed: I don\u2019t have a religion. Then he didn\u2019t send it. He put the phone in his pocket and went to move the sheep to the upper pasture, where the grass was taller and the breeze was kinder. The dog moved easy. The sheep did what sheep do, which is to say, they defied prediction while obeying all the laws of sheep.\n\nHe went to bed early, sunburned on the nose and forearms. He slept and woke twice in that quick, hard way that feels like drowning though you know it isn\u2019t. He went to the kitchen for water, drank from the tap, and in the black window he saw himself and the small yellow kitchen and the ghost of a boat\u2019s mast like a twig against the sky of his memory. He touched his throat as if he had said something aloud.\n\nIn the morning, he met Marin at the gate. She lifted a bag of compost off her shoulder like it was a thing light enough to be reasonable. The dog danced. The sun was in the business of making a day. Somewhere down the hill, he could hear the long horn of a ship turning, sounding its body to other bodies.\n\n\"You look like you thought about boats,\" she said.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Did you think about seasick? Because that\u2019s fair.\"\n\n\"I thought about coiling rope,\" he said. \"And about how knots might help a person tell the truth.\"\n\nShe nodded as if this were not far-fetched. \"We tie ourselves on purpose so we don\u2019t fly away in wind. That\u2019s all.\"\n\nHe wanted to tell her he was already tied to a hill, to a dog, to an apple tree with scab he was trying to solve with sudden tenderness. He wanted to say he was not free, and that this made him happy in a way he didn\u2019t know how to trust. Instead he handed her the hose. She picked it up like an instrument, and the water made a music of its own.\n\nThe days passed then, the way days do when someone has arrived to stand with you inside them. They built and planted and watered together, and sometimes they didn\u2019t speak for an hour and it didn\u2019t matter. He went with her to the harbor on Friday and watched her climb a ladder to the boat with a fluidity that made him feel he had too many knees. He held lines when asked and tried to love the smell of diesel because she did. He ate a taco and almost changed his mind about god.\n\nEvelyn sent him a picture of the basil plant with a caption that said: still judging. He sent back a picture of a row of beans coming up like punctuation. She wrote: promises. He didn\u2019t argue.\n\nIn the third week of Marin working for him, the wind shifted and a fire fifty miles away decided to come their direction, not as flame but as ash. The sky went new. They put masks on and watered things they could not save and then stopped, because water had other jobs. The sheep stood watching with the particular boredom of prey animals who know panic is a currency you cannot spend all at once. Marin\u2019s eyes were flints, lighting without tinder, and he thought, briefly, that there are people made for all the different weather, and he had somehow found one who didn\u2019t laugh at the sky for being itself.\n\nBy the time the ash had settled and the news had moved on, a new thing had happened inside his chest. It didn\u2019t have a name. It wasn\u2019t love because love is a word we use for too many things. It was attention, paid without interest, with a kind of ritual. It was watching someone tie her hair up with a hemp string and wanting to be worthy of that string. He was not good at this. He had been married and been bad at this. He was trying to be better by being still and letting his face be readable.\n\nOne late afternoon, with the light slanting like someone had tilted the whole world, Marin sat on the fence and swung one boot. \"Do you ever think about leaving?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Leaving what.\"\n\n\"This,\" she said, gesturing at the hill, the dog, the sheep that looked like rocks until they moved and the rocks that looked like sheep until they didn\u2019t. \"The way you live inside of this geography. The loops. The mornings.\"\n\n\"Every day,\" he said. \"And then I think about the first thing the sheep do when I open the gate just right, and it\u2019s a thing that feels like music, and I don\u2019t go.\"\n\n\"I thought you might say that.\"\n\n\"And you,\" he said. \"Do you think about not leaving. At the end of fall.\"\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer for a long time. The silence put down a blanket. \"I have a debt,\" she said finally. \"To the boat, to the version of me that keeps getting smaller and is happier for it. There\u2019s something I need to meet out there. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be haunted by my own ankles, the way they itch. But I don\u2019t want to go like a thief. I don\u2019t want to go without planting garlic for someone.\"\n\n\"You\u2019ll tell me,\" he said. He meant: don\u2019t leave me like a weather change.\n\n\"I\u2019ll tell you,\" she said, and then she slid off the fence and into the work again, and the conversation went away like a tide that had come up to your knees but not higher.\n\nThe next morning, Evelyn called and did not bother with the usual mutter of apology that had grown between them like moss. \"I\u2019m on my way up,\" she said. \"Don\u2019t panic. I have a thing I need to bring you, and a thing I need to ask you to do if you can.\"\n\n\"You know you can always come,\" he said, and then wished he could take it back. The invitation was a rope that had to be thrown and then reeled in.\n\n\"I crashed my bike last night,\" she said, with a laugh that wasn\u2019t. \"Not like\u2014don\u2019t. I\u2019m okay. But the world spun at a weird speed for a while and my neighbor, Mrs. Patel, freaked out and now I have\u2026 alerts. I also have a business card of a neurology clinic that looks like a dentist, and I need you to come with me to be someone who hears things and can say what was said back to me. I know it\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s two o'clock in SLO. Can you. And can I leave the car at your place to remind me you\u2019re real.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, already lacing boots in his head. \"Leave the car, take me. I\u2019ll drive. It\u2019s a deal.\"\n\n\"You don\u2019t need to be kind,\" she said. \"But thank you.\"\n\nHe stood on the porch and waited for her. The fog had called in sick that day, and the sun was already showing its teeth. Marin arrived with a bag of seed and saw Evelyn\u2019s car already there and looked at him with something like a question and something like a resignation that belonged to older people. He wanted to say: I\u2019m not going backward. He wanted to say: I am still, always, the sum of my people. He said: \"I have to go to SLO with her. She hit her head.\"\n\nMarin\u2019s hand came half up between them and then down again. She said, thinly, \"Of course. Go. Don\u2019t worry about\u2014\"\n\n\"I\u2019ll pay you for the day, even if you have to leave.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not a contractor with a fragile heart,\" she said, and almost smiled. \"I\u2019m a person who can see your hands are shaking. Go be useful. I\u2019ll water the beans and pretend to be you. I\u2019ll talk to the sheep about music, they won\u2019t understand a word.\"\n\nHe laughed despite himself and the fear riding him. He put his hand on her shoulder as he went past, a little unsteady. She leaned in just enough to tell him she had noticed. Then he was in the passenger seat, and then the driver, because Evelyn insisted, and then they were on Highway 1, the ocean to their right blue like rumor, the radio playing nothing the way a good radio sometimes does. She kept touching her temple, and he kept wanting to pull over and hold her head and breathe for her as if he could.\n\nHe drove her to the clinic and sat with her in a room that smelled like lemon and old carpet and listened to a doctor with a voice like a kind bell. He wrote things down for her. He didn\u2019t say good when there was nothing good to be said, only probable and careful. He brought her a cup of water and made it seem like he did not need to watch her drink it. He walked her to the restroom and waited outside like a new father, stupid with love and terror that he told himself was only muscle memory. When it was done, when she was allowed to go and call someone tomorrow and sleep on her left side and not take stairs two at a time, he helped her into the car, and she said, out of nowhere, \"I\u2019m so angry at my brain for being the thing you touched today.\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t be,\" he said. \"It\u2019s the organ that brought you basil to fight with. It brought you every one of your words.\"\n\n\"It also brought me to you,\" she said, and then shook her head. \"That\u2019s not\u2014 I\u2019m not\u2014 I know what I\u2019m saying. Don\u2019t panic.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not,\" he said, and looked away at a stoplight that was ripening. He was panicking in a slow, organized way, like someone packing a bag for a trip he knew very well.\n\nHe took her home, or to what home meant now: a second-floor apartment in a building with a name that tried too hard, a view of a parking lot with a jacaranda in it that had decided to be a celebration despite the car alarms and the teenagers and the heat. He walked her up. He wrote down the phone number of the neighbor. He put a glass of water where she could reach it and made sure the basil plant had its little saucer filled like a tiny, dignified request met.\n\nWhen he drove back, the light was low and the trees along the creek were practicing being black. He pulled into the driveway and saw that the beans had twined twice around the string Marin had set and that the apple tree had paper at its base like a skirt. He found her behind the shed washing mud off her tools. She looked up, eyebrows askew.\n\n\"She okay?\" she asked, no ceremony of competitive feeling. Just asking.\n\n\"She will be,\" he said. \"I think. I hope.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Marin. \"Would you like to hear about your garlic? Or do you want to sit and let your heart take its boots off first.\"\n\nHe sat on the step and the dog put her head on his knee. Marin came over and sat near him and did not touch him and did not look at him and stayed in the same space as him until the sound in his chest returned to something he recognized. Then she said, \"The garlic is a genius,\" and they both laughed in the dusk, the way people laugh when they have found, for a minute, a ground that does not wobble.\n\nNight came again, and with it the old noises and new questions. He stood by the window, looking at the place the sea would be if the hill would sit down for a minute and let him see. He thought of the boat and the way the mast had looked like a pencil line against his morning. He thought of Marin\u2019s unarguable leaving, written somewhere already in careful, small script. He thought of Evelyn lying on her couch, one hand on her temple as if holding a roof on.\n\nHe did not yet know that everything he loved would align itself along a single day\u2019s axis later that year; that he would be asked to do something that even his stubbornness would call brave; that the way you save one person is sometimes a message delivered to another in a language made entirely of tide. For now he slept, and in the night a fox came and sat at the edge of the garden and watched the cardboard steam in its slow making of soil, its quiet beginning again.",

                              "content": "The morning after the fox, the garden wore a new grammar. Cardboard had softened as if someone had whispered to it all night, and when Alec pressed his hand to it he felt the sweet heat of undoing traveling into his palm. Madrone found the small prints by the compost and sneezed at them like old gossip. A row of broad beans, which yesterday had been only an idea under wet paper, had pried up their first hooks of green, pale and brave. He walked the fence line as the sun made a pale smear in the east and thought how newly alive the insult of fennel looked when you began to win against it. He could smell the ocean under the usual eucalyptus and sheep and rusted-wire tang of old nails, and for once the smell did not make him want to go anywhere, only to stand with the dog and feel a place claim him like a slow tide.\n\nMarin came with an armful of loppers and a ladder over one shoulder, the whole arrangement casual as laundry. She wore a plain shirt and the lemon one in a bundle, for later, because she said you either ended the day in a flannel or in the sun itself if you were doing trees. The hat was the same; the ribbon looked like a line someone had drawn between summer and fall. They went up the drive where the apples threw long patient shade and Marin leaned her cheek lightly to a tree the way you do with an animal you are about to set a hand on. She talked as she placed the ladder and clipped back the first watersprout, her voice full of practical myth. The tree is an animal pretending to be a fountain, she said. We are here to help it remember which way fruit is supposed to hang. The cuts were small and precise; she showed him the angle with her own forearm, the way a body makes a better tool when it remembers what it\u2019s built to do. He climbed behind her, feet careful on rungs, and she held the ladder with one hand and the story of his foolishness with the other until he did not feel foolish anymore. When a limb fell, fat with bad decisions, Madrone hauled it like a trophy and the two of them laughed because joy was not, strictly speaking, against any regulations.\n\nBy midmorning the trees looked less like a rumor and more like intentions. Marin had resin on her wrist that glinted like honey, and when she pulled the kerchief off to wipe her face he saw that the streak in her hair was not iron after all but something more like salt. She charged him the tree rate without blinking, and he handed her two extra bills in a way that tried to say both thank you and do not run your ladder alone on my account. She shrugged the thanks away like a burr and set herself to laying the paper around each trunk as if it were a blessing. He fetched the hose and stood back to watch the water sheet over cardboard and settle into a shimmer before disappearing. The smell that rose was like a remembered promise about rain.\n\nEvelyn texted a picture of a foam helmet and three question marks, and he called her and forced himself to make jokes first and inventory second. She sounded small and frustrated in the way smart people do when their bodies remind them they are mortal. He offered to bring soup and then laughed at himself, because when had he last made soup; she said she had learned to accept mercy without grading it and would take anything except cream of mushroom. Marin listened from the other side of the yard with her head down, the hose making its own valley along the mulch, and when he hung up she looked at him with one of her listening looks, the kind that asks nothing because it wants the answer to arrive from its own desire to be said. He told her the basics because there is a line between basic and betrayal and he was learning to stay on his side of it. Marin nodded and said that the brain is a sassy organ and then asked if basil had been watered, because this was how you cared for someone you had not met in the precise part of their life that was not your business.\n\nFriday at the harbor turned out to be a collage of metal sounds and shadows of gulls and old men in hats that were not jokes. The ketch sat against the pier like a tired queen and Owen stood on the deck with one hand on the shroud and the other gesturing toward a future you could not see if your eyes were too literal. Alec had never been good at ladders that were not touching earth, but he made himself climb because Marin did not ask him to. Up close the boat had a smell he had learned to name from a distance, the conversation between old salt and old oil. A young person with a welded ear cuff and a hammer introduced themself as Hana and handed him a coil of line without apology, as if the world already knew his palms and had a use for them. He held what he was given and watched how rope arced and fell when convinced with a flick of the wrist, admired a knot that sat down in itself and held, and thought of the dozen knots he had learned because sheep will find an exit you never even daydreamed. Owen had the kind of bad-tempered kindness that sailors wear like a ring, and his swearing about the engine was inventive enough to seem like poetry. He showed Alec the shape of the hull from beneath where it was up in a sling and told him the story of a reef off Santa Rosalia as if it were a relative, and Alec realized men become geography when they live with water long enough.\n\nThey ate tacos at a picnic table splintered with history, the hot sauce like an argument that ends well. Marin sat facing the water with her heel hooked on the bench in a way that made him feel he\u2019d never quite had a body until someone else sat in one near him. She had smears of something on her forearm that was either blood or paint; she licked a thumb and rubbed at it and it still didn\u2019t go which made her smile. She told him the boat\u2019s name as if she were telling him hers and it didn\u2019t sound foolish, only ordinary and proud. He didn\u2019t ask why stay small lived under a vessel christened to go elsewhere; he could see the logic in contradiction from here. When a boy in a sweatshirt too big came by to sell abalone shells polished by a cousin, Marin bought one for two dollars and said it was for the apples, which made no sense until she tucked it into the fork of a pruned limb later and the whole tree seemed to receive the joke.\n\nThe landowner showed up the following week in a car that looked like it had known romance in another decade and now just wanted decency. She was a woman with a braid like a cable and the look of someone for whom shock had been a bad use of time once and so she\u2019d stopped offering it to the world. Ruth, she said, and stood with one boot on a post and looked along the fence line in a way that made him straighten. They walked the orchard and he showed her the places apples had started to shape themselves into confessions. She told him about a cousin sniffing around with a developer\u2019s brochure and how she had told him to go pitch his tents in hell, but a niece had a way of liking glossy paper that made Ruth nervous in the nights when she listened to coyotes make their democratic noise. He felt the lease like a piece of paper in his shirt pocket that wanted a lamination he couldn\u2019t afford. She told him she liked the smell of the place again and that the old man down the hill had asked who\u2019d put their hand on the dirt and finally meant it. He offered her a fig and she took it and ate it half like medicine, half like a memory; when she left she thumped the side of his mailbox as if to make it ring true.\n\nThey had their first little emergency two days later and it did not kill anything, which felt like mercy. He found Penny on her side with distension that was too much like a balloon for his heart and he went that quiet that allowed the part of him with competence to put on its coat. He called Madrone to face what needed facing and sent for the trochar and stopped breathing long enough to make the small precise hole that lets ridiculous air become the world again. Marin was there because she had been placing bricks like syllables and when he said hold she held the ewe\u2019s head with a stillness that made her look carved. He did what he had learned from old men and mistakes and the dog had the wisdom to be a statue until it was good to play fool again. The sound the ewe made as she found a new angle against gravity was obscene and decent at once; Marin flinched and then breathed deliberately as if she were coaching her own lungs. Afterward they sat on the grass because sitting is what bodies ask for after you stab an animal out of love, and Marin said that she could do blood but not brains, which made him think of Evelyn and the way mercy takes shapes you don\u2019t choose. He rinsed the tool slow and careful and put it away clean because respect is a habit you build when you expect to need a thing again the next day.\n\nOn a Thursday they went to the DMV because there is always one government office and it is everywhere. Evelyn had set an appointment, which was a prayer in that building, and they took a number anyway which made them laugh, the number and the prayer holding hands like bored children. He had never seen his name look so capable of punctuation until it sat in triplicate under fluorescent light. They signed places that had been colored for them because color is how the state gets compassion onto paper. Evelyn wore her hair pulled back with something that might have been meant for one use only and now got two, and she had that look again that made her neck seem like a place someone had painted a sky. They sat with their shoulders not touching and their humor touching everything. When a woman at the counter said \u201csir\u201d in a way that had almost a lemon tart sweetness to it, he thought about the parts of himself that only came up when strangers asked everything too quickly. Outside, under a palm with the wrong idea about itself, they stood by her Subaru and said goodbye in a good grammar: she touched two fingers to her temple to prove she wasn\u2019t broken, he nodded in a way meant to say both go and stay. Marin drove past going the other direction with the bed of her truck full of straw and honked twice in a rhythm that felt like a secret handshake. Evelyn smiled without turning and said, \u201cYour witch has decent aim,\u201d and he said, \u201cShe\u2019s not mine,\u201d and it sounded like all the words people say when they are busy not saying the obvious.\n\nEvenings began to carry a weight he liked, the way bowls of fruit have weight when someone is coming over. Sometimes he and Marin ate together on the back step and sometimes he took his sandwich to the fence and pretended he had opinions a fence could use. She did not ask the kinds of questions that require confession for their entertainment; she asked what the wind had been like and he understood that meant she wanted the state of his self, not his secrets. She told him the story under her tattoo one night when the fog had been turned on low like a lamp and the dog had rolled herself into something the temperature could not discover. There had been a time, she said, when she had mistaken big for good and hunger for love; she had set out to become horizon and ended up mostly weather. She had stayed in rooms she should have left because music was playing, and she had left rooms she should have stayed in because music wasn\u2019t. A woman on a boat with hands steadier than God\u2019s had said try small, not as an insult, but as an accurate map, and Marin had taken a pen and written it on the inside of her wrist and then looked up while someone else needled it in. She did not tell him the names of anyone who had handed her either sorrow or salvation, which felt like proof of something you could trust.\n\nHe began to learn the currents of the harbor as if they were new paths for the dog. Friday mornings, Madrone watched him leave with a look that was almost complicated; he told himself she was composing an essay about how rope had claimed her person. He brought back to the hill words that did not originally belong to dirt\u2014tabernacle cleat, deadeye, jackline\u2014and put them down among sheet mulch and posts until they sounded like they had always lived there. He found a piece of nautical hardware in his pocket one night, grease black, dense as a threat, and set it on the windowsill like a shrine to all things that hold under strain. The apples started to blush and the garlic put up green that meant business. The beans found their way without asking for help and when he watched them he felt forgiveness for parts of himself he could not shepherd. Marin took a morning off to go to a dentist after months of saying the word like a hex and came back with a new gleam to her smile and three tiny black-and-white pictures of her teeth like moons, which she stuck under a magnet on his fridge for no reason beyond the fact she liked to put proof under cold things.\n\nAsh visited again for two days without the actual insult of flame. The light went to amber and the dog smelled like memory. He filled the stock tank twice and then went inside and did not turn on the news because there are only so many things you can make holy and information isn\u2019t one. Marin worked with a bandanna over her mouth and made jokes with her eyes only, and when she took the cloth down to drink she looked like the photographs of women at strikes he had seen on a calendar once, beautiful in the way that work makes a face plain and plain makes a face truer than hello. Owen showed up with Hana in a truck that did not believe in the concept of mufflers and asked to borrow the hose and left a bag of bolts that could have been coins in a more fortunate kingdom. Hana wandered to the fence with their hands in their pockets and whistled at the sheep in an accent entirely their own, and the ewes pretended not to notice because that is a sheep\u2019s spiritual practice. By afternoon the ash let go like someone who\u2019d remembered a different plan, and he went to the orchard and ran his finger along a leaf and thought of handwriting.\n\nThe first time he saw whales that year he did not tell anyone because he wanted a thing that felt like a secret that was all presence and no story. He walked out at midnight wrapped in old flannel and fog and sat on a half-rotted stump and heard the part of the world that holds everything else inhale. The sound came through the hill with a patience that made his own heart feel like an animal that might someday be trained by kindness. In the morning he told Marin anyway, unable not to, and her face changed to the seriousness that certain gifts demand. She said she had been out once on a friend's skiff when a grey had surfaced without any ceremony and looked like real estate, and how after that the idea of faith became less abstract. They stood by the gate and did not plan anything with that in mind; they simply had better reasons, which it turns out is how you leave a day less cruel than you found it.\n\nWyatt, who thought Marin was a witch, came up the drive one afternoon with the expression of a man whose garden had called him out. He held a zucchini under his arm like a baby he was trying not to admit he adored and asked if witches did house calls for afflicted squash. Marin took his case without offense and sent him home with a lesson on powdery mildew and the suggestion that he name the plant something embarrassing to increase their intimacy. Alec laughed and then wished he hadn\u2019t because Wyatt\u2019s dignity shone like a coin and he admired it. When they were alone again, Marin said that the only people she minded being accused of witchery by were the ones who did it as an excuse to withhold their own responsibility. She flicked a spider the size of a period off her shirt and went back to moving stones as if she\u2019d spoken to a committee.\n\nSummer remembered itself and then forgot and then remembered again. He sold four wethers for a price that made him stand the way a person stands to count what is still in his pockets after a movie with too many explosions. He sat on his kitchen floor and read a pamphlet about drought forgiveness for small agriculture that had been stapled crooked and made dignity miserable by accident. Ruth brought him a clipping about some county board meeting and he promised to go and then didn\u2019t and felt the smallness of that failure like a pebble in his boot and then went the following week instead and sat through two hours of men explaining math to women who had taught it. He spoke once, about fences and hope, and Marin later that night called his voice a tool he\u2019d been hiding behind a paint can, which made him want to buy a shelf for the things he meant to use more.\n\nOn a day with winds from the north that tried to make a quarrel of everything, Owen told him there would be a night test run and not to come unless he planned on either staying on land or seeing the inside of his own fragility. He went anyway, of course he did, because fragility is an animal you either meet or it meets you. They pushed off into a harbor that had decided to be a mixing bowl of black glass and breath. The boat moved like a horse that had been taught to wait until you meant it. He held to a rail he trusted and counted the steps between his dignity and his knees. Marin did not coo or encourage; she put his hand where it needed to go and said careful only when careful was an order from physics. Far out, beyond where the pier light made its small human halo, the water\u2019s rules changed in a way he had never asked to learn, and he learned anyway. He did not get sick. He did not become a sailor. He watched Marin grin into wind and thought of debt not as money but as promises you make to parts of yourself that were starving and you fed on purpose. Coming back in, the boat nosed past the working boats with their names like prayers to bills, and he thought not for the first time that he understood why people leave and why they come back and how sometimes it is the same reason wearing two different shirts.\n\nHe took Evelyn to her follow-up and they sat in another room with other lemon-scented air and a different doctor who said the same things with slightly rearranged commas. He spent an afternoon fixing her kitchen sink because it dripped in a way that made his shoulder ache by empathy and because he could, and because mercy that takes shape in wrenches is easier to accept at first than the kind that sits and stares at your face until you cry. She told him about a coworker who kept calling her Evie in an awful attempt to be part of the club of her, and he promised to come down to the bookstore and leer while buying three copies of an atlas to make a point. They did not touch except when the wrench slipped and she put her palm against his back to steady him and took it away before anyone could accuse that touch of anything. The basil had finally consented to behave and looked smug, and he told it so, and Evelyn laughed and said look at us, giving names and power to leaves.\n\nSeptember slid down the hills like something forgiving. The apples were light as hands on a face. The beans had made opinions about trellises irrelevant. He woke in the night sometimes with the surety that he had left a gate standing open, and went out in boots and pajamas to count, and found everything where it had promised itself it would be. Marin began to coil her words about leaving into smaller and smaller circles, the way you put rope away when it has earned rest. There was a list on her dashboard with boxes next to it: pharmacy, post office, oil change, Wyatt, Ruth, apples, beans, Owen, harbor gear, shoes, garlic, shepherd. He pretended not to see his name but he saw it and it both wounded and healed him because this is what being seen does if you are honest. She told him she would not go without a blessing from the dog, which seemed both ridiculous and like the only rule that mattered.\n\nOn a weeknight that decided to be a weekend early, Ruth hosted a small party that was not a party; people stood in her yard with cups and light on their shoulders and the sound of the ocean doing arithmetic behind the eucalyptus. Someone brought a fiddle that had been taught to make both joy and grief behave and played what it knew, and the old men from the auction yard became younger as they remembered steps they had sworn not to remember. Marin danced a little in place with her eyes closed and then stopped like she had been caught by something she had been trying not to love too much too soon. Evelyn came late, carrying a pie that had clearly argued with her and lost just enough to be perfect, and for an hour Alec stood in a geography of past and future that did not collapse but layered itself like geology. People he had chosen and people who had chosen him and people who had merely tolerated him all mixed until he could not tell which was which and did not need to. Owen told a story about a night off Punta Banda that made someone\u2019s aunt cross herself without remembering she did not do that anymore. Hana taught a kid who had never liked adults to tie a bowline around his own waist and be both caught and free at once. Ruth stood by a fence post and watched everything as if she were keeping weather.\n\nThe night after the not-party, the wind died like a toy that had been played with properly. Alec lay on the couch because the couch was where sleep came easiest now and because it faced the rectangle of window where everything that mattered seemed to practice arriving. He thought of all the pieces of rope in his life and the people who had put his hands on them; he thought of his own throat scarred inside by words he had said wrong and the way it still managed to carry water and coffee and breath without needing to let him know how it was doing it. He went to the door and stepped out and the air was clean in the way air is clean when its work for the day has been done and its result is not spectacular but no one has died. On the hill, something moved that was not a sheep and not a dog and not a person and he did not need to name it to know he should not alarm it. The garden breathed as a body breathes when it has learned that change is not always an assault; the cardboard was turning into soil where in a month he would kneel to pull a carrot that had done what no human had asked it to do. In the distance, down beyond what his eyes could hold, a horn sounded across water the way a message moves in a community: not for you alone, but for you too.\n\nHe did not know it yet, but by the time the apples were mostly a memory and the garlic heads were hung in braids like old wisdom, the day he had been warned about would walk up the drive as if it was asking for help with a map. He would stand with his palms open and accept and fail and accept again, and the saving would be a physics problem dressed as love. For now there was the smell of rosemary on his hands and the scrape of ladder feet that he had learned to set just so, and the dog sighing into sleep like a tide letting go of its own amazement. For now there was Marin\u2019s van turning into the driveway in the morning, the ribbon on her hat faded almost to a color the sky could only make by accident, and Evelyn\u2019s basil putting up a flower she would be told to pinch back and not and then call repentant over later. For now there was the ordinary holiness of work, and the way it made his body a house he might stay in without being lonely.",

Nights stretched themselves over the shoulders of the hills and stayed there a little longer each morning. The apples took on their last colors with a seriousness that resembled modesty more than show. The harbor started to talk about windows, and how weather lets you out the door sometimes like a mother with her keys already in her hand and sometimes like a bouncer who wants to feel your bones for weapons. Owen\u2019s voice, on the days Alec went down to coil and learn, had a new edge that wasn\u2019t fear so much as arithmetic; he was measuring distances between wishes and facts. Marin began to do that thing with her lists where she stopped pretending they were for someone else to see. She crossed out an item about oil and wrote good rope and drew a box next to Ruth that she shaded in slowly over three separate mornings, as if shading were a way of saying thank you.\n\nThe wind shifted from the northwest to a dry chatter out of the inland canyons and every eucalyptus on the hill prepared its flammable gossip. Ruth came up in a truck whose bed had been taught what hay feels like and told him the county had muttered something about shutting the power when the gusts found their business hats. He filled stock tanks as if he were storing quiet. Marin walked the orchard with him and laid her palms against bark like someone speaking into an animal\u2019s better ear; they tucked more paper around the trunks because paper can be a prayer if you give it a job. Owen called from the harbor to say that a man named Shorty with hands like ropes had looked at the engine and said, in a voice like a spoon, that if they didn\u2019t go by the next Friday, they would go a month from now or not at all. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d Owen said, and it sounded both fine and like a cliff. Marin stood nearby with a coil of drip line over one shoulder and made a face that was almost a smile and then wasn\u2019t, and she didn\u2019t look at Alec because looking is a pressure you don\u2019t put on a thing that\u2019s already got a knot in it.\n\nThat night the whales came loud enough that the hill couldn\u2019t pretend not to hear. He went out and sat with his back against the cool of a post and let the sound move his ribs around like furniture. The fox came again and slid along the garden edge like a sentence he would someday be glad to have spoken; it paused by the cardboard that had turned sweet and looked toward the house with the indifference of royalty. Madrone lay down beside him with her head near his knee and sighed in a way that made him think of old men at the auction yard when a good price finally shook out of a stubborn afternoon. He had the thought, not for the first time, that if he stood very still, the land would tell him what it planned to ask. The answer was not words, but he knew it when it came: be ready to be still and to move both, and don\u2019t confuse one for an apology for the other.\n\nThe red flag warning went up on a Tuesday, and it was the kind of Tuesday that had forgotten it was not already August. The power snapped off around noon, indecorous, and did not do that coy thing where it comes back on to reassure you and then leaves you again; it meant it. The sky had that thin tin glare that makes everything you own look rude or too bright. Ruth asked if he would mind setting a line of sprinklers along the edge that faced the road because sometimes fire comes to the party you\u2019ve thrown for it, and sometimes it comes through the neighbor\u2019s yard. He minded only the way all people mind water when it has work and they would prefer it to be the kind of friend that just comes by to tell you a joke. He did it anyway. Marin was at the harbor wrapping the last brittle business of departure into duffels and plastic tubs and the kind of old coffee tins everyone thinks they threw away. She sent him a picture of a coil of three-strand laid down good enough to make a priest nod and he wrote back an obedient heart, which looked wrong on the screen until she sent a fish, which made the whole exchange human again.\n\nBy midafternoon the north had dropped a handkerchief none of them wanted to pick up. The far ridge put up a column the color of a bruise that had taken a class in theater. Ash traveled the way gossip does when someone is bored and mean. The ewes stood and did their slow calculus about heat and remembered water and the places on their bodies where flies would most like to have opinions. He ran the hose along the fence line and then turned it on his own neck because the body requests cool like it requests truth when it is out of it. Madrone brought the sheep in with that easy authority that made strangers forget how work is built on work and not on the cooperation of fate. Alec was not panicking on the surface; underneath, a patient animal was pacing, and he kept talking to it with words that did not require either of them to be wrong.\n\nHis phone buzzed with the old stubbornness of something that wants to be let in. There was a text from Evelyn that began with a name that wasn\u2019t his and ended with his, as if she had been trying on all the beginnings and none fit. The lines were short\u2014dizzy not the cute kind, can you be voice\u2014and then a sentence about the neighbor being gone and a cat who would not leave her shin alone. He felt his chest make that trapdoor motion that ends with your heart on the floor and then climbed down to pick it up and put it back where a heart belongs. He looked at the smoke and then at the flock and then at the dog and then he did the thing he had learned to do since he was nineteen, which is choose and hope choosing isn\u2019t the beginning of the explanation you\u2019ll have to keep offering to no one for years.\n\nHe called Marin because he knew the harbor was listening to other music and would be cruel if he asked it to hear his. She answered on the second ring with the sound of something metal arguing with another metal behind her and a voice that was breathless and intent and pointed at someone else until he said her name and then the point turned toward him. He told her the short version, and it was very short because he did not have time to decorate the truth. She said I can go in a way that did not sound like charity, only like the map her day could be folded into without tearing. He gave her the address and the apartment name that tried too hard, and something about a jacaranda tree that had decided to be a parade no matter how many Subarus wore dents beneath it. She said, \u201cI know the building. I know the jacaranda,\u201d and he believed her. He did not say please because he was at the mercy of enough things; she went anyway.\n\nOn the hill he cut the fence that was between him and a scrap of Ruth\u2019s lower paddock where the ground went naked and unremarkable, which is exactly what you want when you have animals that wear sweaters in a world full of sparks. He felt the burr of the wire through his gloves and it was a familiar small pain that made him grateful because he knew what to do with it. He whistled the way he whistles when his mouth isn\u2019t interested in being pretty. Madrone moved around the flock like a thought you keep having because it is right. They went through and down, the sound of their feet on dirt like dry beans in a metal bowl, and he closed the opening behind them with a crooked grace that would have made a true carpenter roll his eyes and a true shepherd nod. He used the bowline he had learned from Hana\u2019s hands on a Thursday when the harbor had been in a good mood, and the way it sat in itself did something to his breath. He ran lines from the old oak to the truck and then from the truck to the post because he had become someone who saw rope as both answer and question. When he tied off, he put his palm on the knot the way you touch a shoulder to say we\u2019re not done speaking, but you can rest.\n\nWyatt arrived with a plastic trash can that had become water for the hour and an expression on his face that announced he had no interest in the narrative but had brought what the narrative required. He said nothing helpful and everything helpful; he said, \u201cWhere,\u201d and then he put the water exactly where the hands would be if hands had time to be everywhere at once. Together they moved the last stubborn ewes that had found a reason to be offended by the angle of a shadow. The heat took a breath and then let it out in his face like a dare. The smoke did that thing where it makes a second sky out of the one you will have to miss later. He kept his brain on a short leash in the part of its yard where competence lived and told it to stay inside the fence.\n\nMarin\u2019s van made a noise like a promise going downhill, and she drove it not like a person with somewhere to be but like a person with something to deliver that should not be jostled. In the passenger seat, where a box of bolts or persimmons often rode, sat Evelyn with color in her face that did not belong there. The two women looked like soldiers in a small war that had not made the newspapers yet. Marin had one hand on the wheel and one on Evelyn\u2019s wrist not to measure a pulse but to hand one over if a loan would do any good. They had collected the basil out of superstition, and it sat between them judging everyone as was its right. Marin had said, with the very lightest tone, \u201cI am not your husband and you are not my boss, but I am a person who can say you are not allowed to apologize during the next forty minutes,\u201d and Evelyn had said, with more breath than voice, \u201cYou can say that,\u201d and that had been that. They slid into the clinic\u2019s lot and then into a space that someone was kind enough to leave with a hand motion that did not cost them, and the room inside still smelled like lemon and old carpet and authority you could trust.\n\nBack on the hill, it became the kind of midafternoon where time lies down like a dog and kicks its legs because the dream is too much for its body. The fire on the ridge became good television; it made shapes that meant something to the part of the brain that loves a story, and he refused it that comfort because comfort is for later and not for the parts of the day that need you to be accurate. He moved hose and soaked the mulch along the apple trees that had been given their paper skirts, and the steam that came up was like relief learning how to speak. He watered the cardboard because decomposition is a job too, and he would not let it be laid off. Madrone drank and then took a mud bath in exactly the place where he had just put his best work, which is how love makes sure you are still capable of forgiving. Wyatt stayed long enough to make refusing thanks rude, then left because men like him have arranged their lives so they can leave before anyone starts explaining why they came.\n\nHe did not check his phone for as long as you can reasonably refuse someone you love, and then he did check, and there were two messages. The first said checked in, and the second said scan okay, short watch, then rest, then soup? The question mark was aggressive and sweet. He realized his whole face had been doing battle with its own muscles and let it give in, which made his mouth feel like a small room you can finally sit down in. He wrote back with one hand while turning a valve with the other, telling her he had black beans and something to pretend at broth and that he had found tortillas that promised a talent they did not possess and made up for it with sincerity. He wrote to Marin a thank you that was unshowy and got back a picture of a vending machine that had refused a dollar three times and then accepted it as if it had been the machine\u2019s idea all along.\n\nBy late afternoon the wind\u2019s outline softened and the smoke behaved like a person who has remembered their manners. The power did not come back because power likes to make sure we remember who knows where the switches are. He took the dog to the upper edge of the paddock, and they stood looking at the line where wildland had almost decided to misbehave and then, for reasons none of them could take credit for, had not. He tried to let the part of him that hoards fear empty out through the toes of his boots. Ruth drove by slow and rolled down her window to show her face and the braid like a cable and the look of someone counting the cost of the last two hours in fence posts and invoices and sleep. He lifted a hand and she lifted hers, and they made the smaller kind of agreement that makes the larger kind possible.\n\nThe harbor had not been patient, which is not in a harbor\u2019s nature, and the things that could have gone wrong did not, except for one small part of the engine which behaved like an uncle who always tells the story about the time he almost did a brave thing. Owen swore and then made a joke about prayer that would have offended a different God than the one that lived in the business of work. Hana banged their head lightly against a winch and said they were courting wisdom. Marin came back around sunset with salt on her arms as if she had been dipped and set up to cure, and she drove directly to the hill as if there were nothing else a road could do but end where his fence began. She climbed out and leaned on the gate and looked at him with a face that said she had stored facts for him the way refrigerators store mercy. He set a pot on the stove and the flame made its earnest blue, and the beans behaved like beans do when you have told them a story about wanting them to be more than beans.\n\nHe did go down to the harbor after he had handed a bowl to a person who could taste appetite again. The sky between the hill and the water chose a peculiar purple that made him think of bruises with opinions. He stood on the pier with his hands in his jacket pockets because jackets were back in fashion by appointment with evening, and Owen pointed at a dozen things and used two dozen words that were new to Alec and three that were not and one that had nothing to do with the topic and was there for love. They cast off for a brief run, not for courage but to remind the boat that it could move without asking permission from the superstition that likes to gather around dry hulls. As they nosed past the end of the breakwater, the ocean made its simple, inscrutable face. He felt the boat underneath him the way you feel another person\u2019s breath when both of you are trying to pretend you\u2019re only sharing a bench, and he smiled because sometimes pretending has the same shape as faith.\n\nThere was a horn that night, because there\u2019s always a horn, and it sounded across the fat water like a message sent to anyone who had ears. He thought, stupidly and exactly, of his hill and of the tether he had put on the new gate and of the bowline\u2019s willingness to sit without complaint and be what it had promised. He thought of Evelyn on a couch under a lamp not designed for this, and the way her hand had insisted on being useful even when its person would have forgiven it for not. He thought of Marin\u2019s knuckles with resin stuck in their maps and the word under her boat tattoo that had rearranged the volatility of his days. He touched the rail because touching something keeps your body inside of itself when it is tempted to go flying.\n\nThey tied up again without insult or flourish, which is the only way to land if you ask anyone who has landed more than twice. Owen said the window was going to hold and then did the dance all men do when they are trying to predict a person they love who cannot be predicted; he smoked a cigarette that he had already told himself he hadn\u2019t, and then told Alec not to copy him. Hana handed Alec a coil and said, \u201cShow me,\u201d and Alec did, and when the rope lay down like a well-trained dog, Hana said, \u201cLook at you,\u201d in a way that made his ears hot and his hands feel like they belonged on the ends of his arms.\n\nThe power came back after midnight with the immodesty of something that gets paid no matter its performance. He woke to the hum like a pot of insects in another room and felt both grateful and amused by the ease with which a house returns to the illusion that it has always had nerves singing under its skin. He found his phone on the counter where it had slept out of courtesy and saw a message from Marin that said soup cured and a message from Evelyn that said basil judge recants and a picture of a plant with its one small flower pinched back and the stubbornness of life still written all over it. He stood at the sink with a glass and watched the water be water and thought about the simple honor of an element doing what it is.\n\nMorning after, the place had put on its clean shirt. The ash had settled into unhelpful corners. The towels on the line looked like flags from a country where everything is domestic and brave in the same hour. He walked the fence line and tightened the thing he\u2019d tied with the knot he could finally trust because he had learned to trust his own hands tying it. Madrone went ahead and then came back, the way good friends do when a conversation gets interesting. He found the cut wire and made it honest again and considered the places on the land where a gate could be a door and a door could be a boundary that didn\u2019t need to apologize for itself.\n\nRuth came up with coffee in a thermos that had stopped trying to look young three presidents ago, and they drank some leaning on opposite sides of the same post like a marriage that had lasted and not all for good reasons. She grunted at the orchard in a way that meant she noticed and was not going to flatter its progress into arrogance. \u201cYour girl\u2019s leaving,\u201d she said without a question in it. He stared at the apple he had his thumb pressed against and said, \u201cYes,\u201d and did not attempt nobility. Ruth squinted as if trying to make out a shore in fog. \u201cPeople leave,\u201d she said. \u201cLeaves leave. Water leaves. Some of it comes back and some of it comes back as a different thing. I find that insulting and then I get over it and then I get insulted again on schedule. You and your dog will be all right. Your sheep are bored enough to live forever.\u201d He laughed and then the laugh turned sideways and did the other thing laughs do when a day has already had a lot in it.\n\nAt the harbor the boat took on water in the good way, the way that means barrels of it for tanks and not the other kind. Owen did sums with diesel and patience. Hana kissed the deck once, lightly, because there are gods of small blasphemies and it is best to keep them on your side. Marin made a list the size of a palm and stuck it under the edge of a toolbox and did not show it to anyone because sometimes you perform better when the only audience is the part of you that knows what your hands can do. She came up to the hill in the late morning like someone who has been underwater and is pleased, for a minute, by how the air insists. She walked the garden and the beans, cosmically unconcerned with departure, looped themselves insultingly around their lines and offered blossoms with the humility of a thief returning what he stole with interest.\n\n\u201cFriday,\u201d she said, because the word had been measured and could now be said without jinx and without lies. \u201cWe\u2019ll be off sometime after the fog remembers it\u2019s supposed to show off for tourists. We\u2019ll go down past points you know and points I have decided to know, and we\u2019ll wave at people who won\u2019t see us and at people who will take out their phones because this is a country that believes a wave is something to store for later. I will send you the shape of a horizon as often as this stupid box will let me.\u201d She tapped her phone with her forefinger like a farmer lecturing seed. \u201cAnd I will come back when I have done the thing I owe the part of me that believes in rope more than luck.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to say a thing that would make both of them less defenseless, and so he said work, because it was the god she\u2019d named and the one he had also, secretly, found room for. \u201cWork,\u201d he repeated, and it was permission and benediction and the kind of foolish masculinity he would be forgiven for because he was resisting it even while using it as shelter. She put her hand flat in the air between them, not touching his chest and also touching it, because that is how bodies get brave without making a contract and breaking it in the same minute. \u201cStay small,\u201d she said, and the words did not feel like a command but like a compass. He nodded because a nod is the simplest honest punctuation.\n\nThe day of leaving came with fog thick as wool and the kind of quiet in the orchard that happens when the last of the small work is done. He moved the sheep early and they did not argue, which made him suspicious and grateful. He put a note for Ruth on her gate that said the water was set and that he\u2019d walk the upper line at noon and again at evening. He stood with his hands in his pockets a full five minutes before getting into the truck because standing still is a skill and he was trying to deserve it. He drove down to the harbor with Madrone in the passenger seat because she had opinions too and because he didn\u2019t know how to say goodbye to a person and a boat without something in the cab with him that loved him enough to sneeze at his collar.\n\nThe pier had become a bless-and-curse parade, which is to say, a normal day with costumes. Owen moved like a man whose bones had agreed to cooperate with his plans for a set number of hours. Hana wore a life vest like an apology for daring to live. There was a woman with a thermos and a sweater and a laugh like a gull who pressed a muffin into Alec\u2019s hand as if all departures required carbohydrates. Marin was not on deck because of course she was not; she was under, checking a thing with a sound that made sense to her and not to the rest of them. When she came up, it was with her hair rope-loosed and the flannel tied around her waist and a smudge on her cheek that had nothing to do with anything except narrative. She saw Madrone and made the sound a human makes when she recognizes a god she respects that has no interest in being worshipped.\n\nThey did not touch like lovers or like saints. They touched like people who have been working side by side and are about to stop for the length of a season and do not want to lie to each other about what that will cost and what it will pay. He handed her a length of line because handing is safer than asking. She took it and it was then both a line and a thing the two of them had used at the same time for the same reason and therefore a sentence that did not require a verb. Owen yelled a thing that sounded like profanity and caution braided together, and Marin laughed into the wind that had finally decided to come to its job.\n\n\u201cTell your apples I\u2019ll check their papers in winter,\u201d she said, and climbed.\n\n\u201cTell your boat I like her better from above than below,\u201d he said, which is a way of saying we will not glamorize any of this and will love it for real.\n\nThey moved off like a thought that had been sitting at the back of the brain for months and finally came forward and said, listen. The fog lifted its hem to let them under and then dropped it again as if embarrassed by its own sentimentality. He stood on the pier until the last of the mast marks [dis]appeared not in a dramatic vanishing but in a gentle losing that felt more accurate than a cut would have. Madrone sat and then lay down and then put her head on her paws and allowed her ears to interpret the last horn as an instruction to rest.\n\nDriving up the hill, he passed the jacaranda in the parking lot and it had let go the last of its purple and was preparing to go back to a sensible green. He watched the building where he had carried a woman with a bandaged dignity up a flight of stairs and thought about the parts of his body that are useful precisely because they are not excited by the idea of being useful. On his own driveway he stopped the truck halfway up and sat with the engine off and his hands on the wheel and listened to the house make the sounds houses make when you give them a chance to confess their pipes.\n\nIn the afternoon, with the fog thinking about leaving its job early, he walked the orchard and did the small work of touching fruit to see who would come in and who would be left to sweeten a day or two more. He tied up a branch that had decided to prove its generosity by breaking under the weight of its ambition. He used a knot he had not known a month ago and it held with the ease of a thing that had been waiting for him to be ready to use it. In the distance, beyond the eucalyptus and the pale grass and the sign that someone had stuck up properly for the first time in years, he could hear a horn sound not to him and to him both, and he lifted his head as if his neck had been taught to obey a tide. He said, to no one and to everyone that had made him, \u201cWork,\u201d and then he went back to it because work is what holds you until the new shape of your life is no longer something you are only practicing in private.",

The mornings didn\u2019t argue; the sheep did what sheep do, which is to entertain the possibility of cooperation while reserving their right to misunderstand. He found that his hands went to the places hers had been without asking him first\u2014the hose hung back on its nail properly, the cardboard tucked with the corners squared, the loppers put away with their jaws closed like a sleeping animal. The apples gave up their last bright stubbornness in a week that pretended to be summer again and wasn\u2019t, and the garlic shouted its intention up through the mulch like arrows deciding to become grammar. In the kitchen he found resin on a glass and left it there two days, an altar to a day with ladders, and then scrubbed it with vinegar and an old brush and felt ridiculous for feeling solemn about success.\n\nTexts arrived from numbers he had given permission to enter his life. From Marin: a horizon drawn as a single line and below it a deck with evidence of breakfast that could have been any ocean\u2019s version of toast, with the caption \u201cgalley admits defeat and then recovers.\u201d The next day, a coil of rope tucked into itself with such satisfaction that it made his palms itch to mess it up, with \u201cShorty approves. I need you to be jealous of this knot to keep balance in the universe.\u201d A sound file he played with his phone held to his ear like something that would leak: water on hull, a pan clinking, someone saying a sentence with calm profanity in the background, a gull laughing the way gulls laugh at our devotion to anything. Then nothing for two days and then two words\u2014\u201cfairgoing, sleepy\u201d\u2014that weren\u2019t technically words but worked because the ocean forgives grammar if the spirits obey physics.\n\nHe brought soup to Evelyn and came away with books to return on the honor system because the honor system had always suited him until it didn\u2019t. At the store he stood in the back while a young poet in a shirt that looked like rain read four pages about a bird that wanted a name for its particular flight and refused them all. He watched Evelyn be the kind of courteous that would prevent cruelty from being comfortable and thought of a life composed of small rescues that no one posts about because they do not look like victory even when they are. They ate dumplings from a place with a menu that seemed to have been translated from joy, sitting on the curb behind the shop because the air was decent and his knees didn\u2019t mind that kind of humility. When he drove back up, the jacaranda had decided it was a sober tree again, and he found he missed the ridiculousness of purple and was ashamed of that for exactly the length of time it takes a dog to decide to nap on the wrong shirt.\n\nRuth\u2019s niece did come, as forecast by the expression on Ruth\u2019s face two weeks earlier, and she was neither villain nor savior, which made the business of resisting her more complicated. Mariah had cheekbones like ambition and a softness around the mouth that meant she had not yet decided if she would be kind and was willing to be persuaded. She walked the fence with Alec and looked at the work the way you look at a thing you have been told is valuable when you are not yet sure how to appraise value. \u201cThere\u2019s money in it,\u201d she said, meaning the land, and he said, \u201cThere\u2019s also time in it,\u201d and watched her flinch at the notion that time could be currency and not be immediately exchangeable. He did not make speeches because speeches invite rebuttal and he wasn\u2019t asking for a debate; he showed her instead how the paper at the base of the apple trees made everything under it taste like rain, and he told her the names of two sheep as if they were neighbors rather than product. When she left, she returned the wire he had unclipped for her like someone who had borrowed a spoon and didn\u2019t want to be accused of bad manners, and he took that as a small win on a board where no points would be recorded.\n\nThe weather leaned, then, the way it does when it is considering doing something memorable. The inland threw back heat for old time\u2019s sake, the sky went blue to the edge of exaggeration, and then the first storm of the year bloomed green on a weather map he scrolled with his finger like someone democracy had placed in charge. Owen called from a number that wasn\u2019t saved because he liked to make sure humans were paying attention, and said the words \u201cwindow\u201d and \u201cbar\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re making our run,\u201d and Alec said, \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d not because he had a right to tell water people what to do but because love will try an imperative even when it prefers permission. Owen said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d with that masculine prayer that pretends not to be a prayer because it swears. When the call ended, the sea at the edge of his hearing lifted in his head like he\u2019d bent down too fast and stood up too quick; he took a breath so deliberate it could have been photographed for instructional purposes and went to check the stock tank because the world insists.\n\nThe morning of the crossing looked like it had been arranged by a production designer who had worked fifteen long years in the church of subtlety and had been fired and replaced by an enthusiastic nephew. The fog tried to hang low and theatrical and then got yanked like a curtain; the swell was long and honest and then, in an hour, had teeth. He put the dog in the truck without saying why, which is how the two of them managed their politics. At the harbor the local men had their hats set at angles that meant they disapproved of the present and of the future besides; the women had thermoses and saw everything and said only what would be of use. The bar\u2014that shallow tantrum between the ocean and the mouth of safe water\u2014wore patches of white like spills and then arranged itself into something that was almost a rhythm and then insulted anyone who tried to name it. He saw the ketch nose out past the last mooring and felt, more than saw, the moment where courage can\u2019t distinguish itself from faith and so, to be safe, calls in a favor from skill.\n\nThe boat rose and fell in a way that made sense to the part of his body that had watched horses test their riders and hills test their hikers and sheep test every fence post he had ever nailed. It went up a green wall and came down the quiet behind it and then met a cross pulse like a lie told by a friend. The engine announced its existence the way engines announce their existence when they are being asked to reconcile their self-image with physics. Hana stood just abaft the mast with a line coiled like a polite threat, and Owen\u2019s legs were braced in a stance that was nothing at all like dancing and had all of dance\u2019s honesty. He did not see Marin on deck and knew better now than to say her name into the wind inside his skull like a spell. The boat made the bar\u2019s middle and found a seam and slid along it like someone who knows how to move through a room where they are both loved and resented, and then a set came in with the timing of a party crasher and stood up. The nose lifted and then the whole world went the color of a bottle and the boat did not fall off her line so much as accept a slap with dignity\u2019s back teeth clenched.\n\nHe realized he had his arm around Madrone\u2019s neck in a way that implied he needed the dog more than the dog needed oxygen and made his hand open because he was trying to be better in the small ways first. The ketch came down into the harbor\u2019s safety with the gracelessness that makes real life seem virtuous, and the pier\u2019s voice changed from collective inhale to the kind of exhale that comes with a muttered critique of daring. Owen flashed the briefest look to the end of the pier where people had been standing with the attention of gamblers and then took a breath he wasn\u2019t going to admit to and pointed the boat toward a slip he had no business owning and every right to take if he could manage it. Alec had not noticed he\u2019d walked until he found himself on the fuel dock where the men whose hats had decided on pessimism were now generously agreeing to help. He had rope in his hands before he had earned it; Hana threw and he caught, and it was the easiest thing the day had asked anyone to do.\n\nIt should have ended there in the comparative boredom of tying up and swearing at cleats. The storm, bored with bureaucracy, stiffened a gust just as Hana stepped nowhere that was floor, and it wasn\u2019t a dramatic fall in theatrical blue water, just the invention of a gap between deck and dock at the wrong second. They slid and vanished with a sound that was all syllable and no language, and the part of Alec that had made the hole in Penny\u2019s side months ago without letting his hand shake because he had chosen competence over panic put on its boots without asking his permission. He was on his stomach before his brain bothered to object, rope around his forearm the way Hana had taught him with their ridiculous patience, and the cold hand of the harbor slapped him in the face with its old joke about consequence. Someone yelled in a tone that had too much neighbor in it and not enough command, and a woman reached for a ring buoy like a saint reaching for her icon, but Nikolai physics was already in the room and demanded a different old story.\n\nHana\u2019s face came up where the dock doesn\u2019t love anyone; their eyes had the rolled-back white of a horse\u2019s for half a second and then came forward like a man who has remembered his wallet. Alec got the rope under ribs and around without asking consent because there are times when consent is not a form signed but an equation solved and the only number you need is two human bodies not drowning. He did the bowline the way you do the prayer you learned from a parent you argued with for twenty years; it sat the way a good dog sits when company comes. He leaned out too far, too stupidly, the water got his chest and found out what fear tastes like, and he used the angry strength of a person who has had enough of apologizing to pull a human being whose breath he wanted to hear again to where other hands could be hands without taking a college class first.\n\nThere were hands, thank God there were hands, and the kind of shouted instruction that does not question its own authority. Owen appeared on the dock without the geometry that gets a man there from a moving deck with dignity, and it didn\u2019t matter because he had the swearing voice and the eyes that make fragile people obey and sturdy people try. The knot, the good knot, held, and Hana came up on the dock like a fish that had agreed to become an anecdote and coughed in a way that made the old woman with the thermos start to cry with relief and annoyance. Alec discovered he was bleeding from a very honest place on his elbow and laughed, which is not a sign of comedy but of a body using air to prove its point. Madrone had been sent back by a reasonable part of a reasonable man at the last second and stood now with her whole body pointed at what she would have done if she had been allowed, and it was enough to make everyone involved pretend they were more competent than they felt.\n\nThere was no grand conclusion. The engine sulked and then settled, the lines lay down like animals convinced, the swells kept having their opinions and no one argued with them any longer. Hana, blanketing a shiver with vulgarity, touched the knot and said, ridiculously, \u201cThat\u2019s tidy,\u201d and Alec could not make his face do anything sensible for a minute. Owen clapped him on the shoulder and then realized he had clapped the wrong shoulder for a man who had a cut on his arm and then clapped the other shoulder because you do not undo a thank you by apologizing for its form. A paramedic with a soft voice that had seen bigger lunacies put a dry blanket where it would be useful and made sure Hana\u2019s teeth were the kind that chatter and not the other kind. Someone tried to tell the story already and got it wrong, and someone else told it better, and the whole thing settled as quickly as a version of an event can, which is to say, not very, but enough to get on with the rest of the day.\n\nLater, back on the hill, the dog did not let him take off his boots without inspecting the new geography of his elbow, and he let the inspection happen because she had come from a long line of beings who had been denied too much honesty by traps and fences and leashes and humans who wanted their obedience without promising their steadiness. He washed the cut in the sink like a child and put a clean cloth on it that would not pass for professionalism and would pass for care. The garden smelled like billowed paper and mushroom breath and his own shirt, stupidly, smelled like harbor, like diesel and rope and panic that had done its work and been demoted. He got a text from an unknown number that said \u201cYou saved my kid,\u201d which was moving and wrong because Hana had been saving themselves for twenty years and had only allowed him to interrupt that with a rope when the math required it, but he let the gratitude land like a small coin you don\u2019t spend because you like the shape.\n\nA message came from Marin after midnight when the house had remembered what electricity sounds like and he had not, \u201cWe cleared and then got slapped twice for our sins. All good. A feeling made me breathe like someone running and not running. Did the land move under you? Did you tell it to wait?\u201d He stared at the little bright lies on the screen that feel like stars if you\u2019re lonely enough and wrote back, \u201cPulled someone out of a mistake with your knot. They did most of the work and we yelled good things at physics. Dog supervised. Apples pretending not to be proud.\u201d There was a pause long enough to respect distance and then, \u201cLanguage received. Tide says hi. Proud of you and of the bowline. Stay small,\u201d and a picture of something that could have been dawn or weed cloth, which was fitting.\n\nHe slept for a piece of an hour and woke to the sound of a truck that wasn\u2019t his on the drive and the discipline, newly minted, to let the visitor make their noise before composing a defense. It was Ruth with the niece again, more paper that had too much color and a face that had been introduced to the reality that the county does not read poetry. They sat at the table and the dog offered her head in installments to new hands, and he found himself speaking about floodplains and feed bills and the market price for wool like a man who had decided to use all the long words in his store on one day. Mariah watched the small muscle at his jaw jump and then stop jumping because he made it stop, and something in her expression shifted the way a field does when you finally lay in some water and it stops pretending it is nothing but dust. She said, surprising herself, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s that I am trying to decide if what I know is allowed to matter where I live,\u201d and he said, surprising himself, \u201cIt\u2019s allowed to matter where you stand, and the trick is to stand long enough that the permission becomes boring.\u201d\n\nHe went to see Evelyn after lunch because she had sent the kind of message people send when they are trying to be light and cannot resist the gravitational pull of truth. She had a bruise blooming on her temple that looked like the kind of flower the basil would have disapproved of, and she had a look like someone who had been told to rest for legitimate reasons and had only a kindergarten\u2019s worth of experience doing so. He set a kettle on and made a tea that had no right to be soothing and was, and when she asked if he had gone to the harbor the way a person asks a single question to mean a dozen, he said he had and then didn\u2019t say the other names because loyalty sometimes looks like omission. She told him about a customer who had cried in the stacks without apology and how she had taken him to the maps section and asked him to pick a place and he had chosen Nova Scotia because his grandfather had been from there and because the word comforted him even if the latitude did not. He told her he liked the idea that saying a word could warm a person and made a grocery list in his head for more beans and dog food and aspirin and then remembered that life is not a list, no matter how many lists keep it from becoming unbearable.\n\nThe storm worked itself out over two days, like a couple that argues properly, and left everything cleaner and meaner. The hills went the color of secrets right before the person you love decides to tell you one, and the fences shone in a way that made them seem new despite being exactly as crooked as before. The sheep found a limb someone had left too low and stripped it of its dignity, and he laughed because it felt good to be angry at a small thing again after considering the size of the water. He walked the orchard with a roll of tape and a pocket of clips and the sigh of a man who has broken and mended the same thing four times and still believes in the virtue of preparation. He tied up a limb not because it was in danger today but because the habit of rescue is a muscle that is either trained or not, and he had decided he wanted that muscle to be honest.\n\nA week later the boat sent a picture of a cove that looked invented, and then another of a gas station with pelicans on the sign as if they were advertising fuel for birds. Owen called long enough to say they\u2019d had a row with a customs official that was resolved with paperwork and humility, and that the engine had stopped being offended by the way it was constantly being asked to do the one thing it had been built to do. Hana sent a photograph of their forearm with a welt in the shape of a cleat and the caption \u201cit tried to name me and failed, as all gods will,\u201d and he laughed aloud in the kitchen and startled the dog, who does not believe in gods except the ones who carry beef jerky.\n\nHe did the thing Ruth had asked in the old, uncomfortable way of women who expect competence and do not need gratitude to give them courage. He went to a meeting and said a sentence about water rights that made a man with a good suit and an unsubtle watch look at him like he had said a thing in a language that was not supposed to be spoken at public microphones. He went to a different meeting and said nothing and listened to a neighbor with bad knees and an acre of goats talk about loneliness in a way that allowed the room to look at their phones less and their hands more. He came home from both meetings feeling like he had sat through the first half of a movie with a score too earnest and decided to be the person who does not give up on art or policy just because evening comes.\n\nOctober remembered itself and became the kind of month that arranges light like people arrange knives and forks for a meal that is meant to be decent. The garlic took itself seriously and the beans refused to stop even when the nights told them they were being ridiculous. The apples became a chore that was also a gift and then a memory, as all good chores are. He picked the last of them with Madrone watching like a superintendent and took a bag down to the bookstore and set it on the counter with the note \u201cfor staff and basil\u201d because humor is a way to request forgiveness for your generosity. Evelyn set one aside and said she would take it home and leave it where she could see its bruises and perhaps learn something about mercy for produce and for herself.\n\nOn a morning that did not try to be anything but a morning, the day on the hill stood in front of him with its map folded wrong. A car he did not know came up slow with its turn signal still clicking from the main road like a nervous habit; a woman he did not know stepped out wearing a uniform that had already taught her that people will attempt to make it a costume when they want to argue. She had a folder and a face that had been trained to deliver news in sizes, and he had the immediate impulse to say \u201cno\u201d before he knew what it was he was refusing. She looked past him at the fence and the dog and the shape of a hill that believes in privacy and said, \u201cAre you Alexander Jameson,\u201d and he said, \u201cI am, but try Alec,\u201d and she said, \u201cSometimes I can try, and sometimes I am not allowed,\u201d which made him like her even as he began to dislike everything else that was about to happen.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the worst thing and it wasn\u2019t the best because those are category errors; it was the truth, on paper, that a storm farther south had made a choice and then made it again and that choices have consequences even for the competent. A man at a harbor with a different name had called a line too loud and a hand had slipped on metal and the water had done its work and then apologized to no one, because water does not apologize. It was not fatal, which sentence sits in the mouth like dry bread and does not soften for tea, and it was not nothing. It was the kind of news that requires driving and whispering and a phone call at two in the morning when you don\u2019t trust anyone to tell you what happened unless you can hear their breath misbehaving while they do. She handed him the papers like someone handing a person ghostweights and he set them on the hood of his truck because he was not ready to let them into the house where coffee had happened and laughter had been stored.\n\n\u201cWho,\u201d he said, and she gave a name that was almost familiar and then clicked into the place where familiarity becomes grief. It wasn\u2019t Marin and he tried to put the \u201cnot\u201d into the right part of his body without it doing damage on the way. It was a man who had taught Marin to hold the shroud with soft hands and who had said the thing about knots remembering themselves and had a laugh like a crow bragging; it was someone he wanted to have a beer with later and now would have to settle for using a word like memorial without feeling like a politician. \u201cWe need to notify next of kin,\u201d she said, and he heard in the way she said kin that she did not mean it only legally, and he knew that the word is wider than blood when a body has given its labor to a community. He took a breath and then he took another and then he said, \u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d He had the ridiculous thought that he should bring apples and then felt grateful for the part of his heart that reaches for fruit before reaching for formal speech.\n\nThe dog did the practical thing and got into the truck because that is who she was when the world couldn\u2019t decide which version of itself to be. He made three calls in the kind of order that you can only hope makes sense in hindsight. Ruth said, \u201cI will tell who needs telling up north,\u201d because land has its own phone tree, and a man at the harbor answered on the second ring with a sound that required a stillness Alec did not know he could require from himself and then said, \u201cI know,\u201d and \u201cI am with his sister,\u201d and \u201cYes, yes,\u201d and then an exhale that was not approval and not complaint, something else. He drove with the officer because she had to be there and because it is wrong to make people go alone into rooms where others will become different forever. He did not speak in the cab except when a nonsense syllable escaped and that nonsense, for once, was what language had been designed for; she let it exist and did not ask it to present its papers.\n\nThe rooms that held the people who needed to know were not dramatic. A kitchen with magnets that had ideas about vacations and a bowl with a few apples past their prime that made him want to steal them to spare someone\u2019s pride; a living room with a couch that had been held down properly for years; a porch with a chair that had seen all weathers. He said a name over and over like a person tilling hard ground, and each time the sound made a different halo in the air and then fell. Grief has a paperwork that humiliates everyone it touches because it insists on spelling; they signed things in triplicate and the women around him kept putting water where it would do good and a man kept trying to fix something that did not need fixing at this moment because his hands were built to be of use and could not accept that the work right now was to be useless. He drove back up the hill when it was dark enough that every other car looked like a confession that had decided to leave town, and the dog put her head on his thigh and left it there until his fingers remembered the shape of her ear and so did the rest of him.\n\nHe wrote to Marin, in the middle of the night, when the part of the world that had gotten the news by siren and document finally went to sleep and the part that gets it by tide was awake. He did not craft. He said, \u201cI am told you know already but I couldn\u2019t not say it. I am here for the sister, and the women are here for me and for themselves, and the knot did not fail, which is not the point. I have apples. I have soup in an arrogant pot. I have your line of paper around the trees and I am sitting near them because stillness is the only way I have to listen as far as where you are.\u201d He did not expect an answer because expecting anything from a body in a storm is a small sin; he got one at dawn that said, \u201cWe heard it. We felt the hole. It isn\u2019t a hole the way a map shows you them; it is the other kind. We are coming in. Not to leave, to speak to water in a way that does not require forgiveness. Keep the dog. Keep the apples. Keep your hands clean and your rope handy.\u201d\n\nBy noon the sky had become the color of a bruise in its late, bragging stage. Owen called him and said nothing but his name twice and then an address and then hung up, which is efficient and which Alec appreciated and which made his heart speed up in a way that got old and new fear to shake hands. He drove again and found Owen standing outside the harbor office looking both like a man who had spent too many nights not sleeping and a boy who had learned a new word in a dangerous language and wanted to say it in the wrong room. They stood like men whose bodies had been built to absorb weather and whose faces had been built to give women less to worry about than they deserved to have; they failed, which was good. Owen said, \u201cWe could use someone who knows what a fence is for,\u201d and Alec laughed, unexpected, because what do you call the work of standing between your people and the version of the world that wants to behave like a weapon if not fencing.\n\nThey wrapped rope around posts that had not been designed for this exact load and made them accept it; they hung tarps where the sky had given up on the notion of privacy; they moved boxes that had tried to become oceans and put them into rooms that had not been built to hold them. Hana came up the dock with their mouth set in a line like a thread ready to be threaded and said, \u201cI will not tell this story yet, but when I do I will only use new words,\u201d and he saluted them in a stupid way that did the work anyway. He found a boy with a hat too clean and taught him the knot he had used because the boy would either be needed for it later or not, and either way Alec would be able to pretend he had done one thing correctly today. He found places for hands to rest so they would not shake. He found water for a mouth that would not accept wine until the wine was required. He found quiet where people could do the thing grief requires in a country that does not forgive it: nothing.\n\nThe first night after the news, he slept on the couch because it had become the piece of furniture that agreed to his arrangements with the dark. He woke at three to a silence that rang, and for a second he thought he had become an idea a person had had about how men should be when the world uses them as tools and then felt the weight of his foot on the floor and realized he still was. He went out into the yard and stood by the cardboard turned soil and said the only prayer he knew that did not feel like a letter to a stranger: thank you for work. He could not feel the sea from here in the same way as sometimes; it had decided to be its own weather and had gone somewhere else with its noise. He put his hand on the place where the rope cuts into his palm when it is doing what it was made to do, and he felt the fibers that were not there and accepted that memory is a way a body injures itself in exchange for keeping a person you loved alive long enough to finish one sentence.\n\nIn the days after, the hill settled back into doing the part of living that no one rewards because it involves very few parentheses. Ruth came up with her braid tired and looked at him for a long time without asking him to perform a competence he did not possess; she nodded once and said, \u201cAll right then,\u201d which is the kind of benediction landowners can give to the men who mind their fence lines. Evelyn came with soup that had pretended to be ambitious and then remembered the virtue of being itself, and she left it on the counter without demanding he say anything besides its temperature. Wyatt brought a zucchini in November because plants do not know when to stop and neither do a lot of people, and when Alec laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of that particular green, he felt like someone had placed a hand on his chest in the exact right spot and told his heart to keep doing its job.\n\nMarin came up in a borrowed car because of course she did, who else but a person who believes in knots enough to leave would borrow a car rather than pretend the act of returning didn\u2019t require other people\u2019s engines. She wore a jacket that had seen three kinds of weather in one day and had salt on it that the hill did not understand and resin on a sleeve the kitchen was already familiar with and a face that had been asked by geography to provide a larger map than she had had the audacity to think she owned. She stood at the fence. He came to the fence. They did not perform obligation or romance; they performed the exact pressure of hands on wood and then on cloth and then on skin that makes a human admit the day is, in fact, real. She said his name like an address where she had been before and he said hers like a compass that had stopped being a suggestion. The dog made the sound a dog makes when she\u2019s glad and neutral and knows everyone is trying their best.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not done with him,\u201d Marin said, not about the dead exactly, but not not, and he understood she meant more than his body and more than memory and more than the water\u2019s tendency to make everything it touches equally its own. \u201cWe will tell it right,\u201d she added, and he nodded, because the telling is either the saving or it is insult, and there are no other options that keep you the kind of person you can live with. They went to the orchard because standing in rooms is something you do when you are done for the day with the difficult work of being seen in daylight, and it wasn\u2019t yet time to go inside anywhere. They walked between trees that had shed their jobs for the season and looked like old men at a bus stop, and they spoke of nothing you could put on paper and everything you could keep for later in the place in the chest people keep for nuts and nails and photographs.\n\nWhen she left that night, she put her hand on the knot of his elbow where the cut had just learned not to be offended by movement, and he felt something rearrange that was not desire and not duty and had the shape of both, which is to say the shape of a thing you can safely build around. He stood by the gate and watched her taillights go down the drive and felt not abandoned and not attended, but held in a conversation the land had considered him worthy of overhearing. The sea sent a sound along the low places between houses and fences, and he heard it as the only language that never lies: something large continuing to exist.\n\nHe slept some hours without interruption and woke to the kind of morning the coast allows after indulgence, plain and almost severe. He took the dog out and they walked the new piece of fence he had built to appease his own nervous system and found a place where the wire wanted better and made it so. He went to the garden and pressed his palm flat on what had been paper and was now nearly a substrate and thought, uselessly and accurately, \u201cWe did that,\u201d meaning the three of them\u2014woman, man, dog\u2014and a handful of worms who had signed no contracts and made more difference than anyone else. He made coffee that tasted like the end of a monologue and then, because the day had asked nothing too large yet, he went to the sink and washed the bowl that had held the soup and the knife that had cut the zucchini and did not put the knife down until it shone like reason. He did not look at his phone for an hour because he had decided that attention, paid without interest, is the only wealth he will not be ashamed to leave to anyone after all this is done.",

It rained in a way that reminded him of childhood, when water still knew how to go where it had been taught, and the creek in the arroyo remembered its groove and praised it. The second rain came harder and forgot its manners altogether. By the third, the sky had stopped doing anything as polite as weather and had started in on a project. The radio called it an atmospheric river with the kind of earnest authority that made you forgive its fondness for metaphors, and the eucalyptus threw down their leaves the way bored men toss cards in a game they didn\u2019t mean to win. The hill took it at first, patient, sucking like a dry sponge until the sponge learned how to leak.\n\nHe had been waiting for this since he stapled his lease to the inside of a kitchen cabinet a year ago and wrote the numbers down on a piece of tape like talismans: the water, the water, the water. He walked fence and checked posts that looked sturdy when sober and less so when the ground under them started to think about other careers. He moved the ewes before they asked, which is a courtesy they do not recognize, and still he offered it because dignity in animals is contagious if you let it be. Madrone wore the rain with that resigned optimism all good dogs keep for days when every smell gets turned up to the kind of volume that makes sense only if you are built for it. He covered the woodpile and then uncovered it because the wind persuaded him his system of ropes needed revision, and he found himself thanking Hana under his breath for a lesson about half-hitches and leverage that had seemed like a game under a sunny mast and now moved his hands as if they had been taught long before he was born.\n\nTexts came like bottles thrown from a party. From Marin: \u201csouth of Ensenada. Boat and crew pretending at wisdom. Rain everywhere, different style. You?\u201d From Owen: \u201cbar is a rumor down here, different insults. You\u2019d hate it and love it. Keep your head, goats in our street down here, everywhere is everywhere.\u201d From Ruth: \u201cpower probably going down. Tanks full? niece convinced rain is opportunity. you\u2019ll like her better this week.\u201d From Evelyn: a picture of the bookstore door propped with a milk crate and mop water making a series of sincere lakes just inside. He told her to close and to go home and to let the jacaranda decide what season it was without her; she wrote back bossy and good, okay Dad, and sent a second photo of basil cut down before flowering like proof that she could be taught.\n\nThat night, the wind stopped negotiating and started taking. The hill became the kind of instrument you only touch if you both want to play and are prepared to be played. Down along the arroyo, where he\u2019d spent half of summer cutting thistle and cursing whoever had planted pampas grass as if it were a pet, the brown water lifted itself over its banks with a smoothness that made violence look elegant. It went through the fences like a rumor through a town where no one can afford to ignore gossip. He went out with a headlamp and an optimism he did not insult himself by naming courage and checked his corners. The cardboard in the garden swelled until it looked like pillows under a quilt; he pressed his hand down and felt the busy heat of undoing still going to work under all that indifference. He told the dog not to be a hero. The dog listened because she knew that heroes get themselves killed when no one needs them to, and the world\u2019s already full.\n\nAt two in the morning his phone sang the blunt note of something that had not waited its turn. It was Ruth\u2019s number but Mariah spoke in the clipped sentences of someone who had sat in a car with the wipers going full speed and only seen their own fear in the glass. \u201cThe road above the lower gate just\u2026 a piece went. Aunt Ruth won\u2019t let me say slide like the news says. But that\u2019s what it is. There\u2019s a sedan there. They tried to turn around and they\u2019re nose down. Lights on. No one hurt yet. I think. I think there\u2019s a woman inside.\u201d The part of him that had loved tricks\u2014that had once believed you could get away with living as if people didn\u2019t care if you went missing for an afternoon\u2014left the room, and the part that knew what to do with rope took its chair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d he said, and he was already putting on the boots that had only just stopped believing they were wet. He grabbed the coil he had kept by the door since the harbor taught him that rope within reach is a friend you won\u2019t betray. He took the old rescue bag with the ring buoy he had thought a joke when he bought it at a yard sale and had kept because fate likes tidy circles. Madrone stood at the truck door with the complaint dogs use when they intend to forgive you if you behave; he pointed at her bed and said \u201cstay,\u201d and she went the way disciplined love goes, reluctantly, without sulking.\n\nThe road to Ruth\u2019s lower gate had been paved by a man who loved his work and compromised when he had to. Tonight, a piece of it had decided to return to the idea of gravity. He parked before the place where the berm had given up and the shoulder had become the bright mud that knows how to laugh at plans. The sedan sat nose down in what had been a drainage ditch and was now a small river with ambitions. Its rear tires spun in a black shine every few seconds because panic has its own schedule. Inside, in the light that made faces look like masks, a woman held the wheel with both hands as if it were telling the truth. The current pushed at the car with the persuasion of someone with time. Beyond it, the lower pasture was a new lake, and his fence there had become a line of ideology.\n\nHe took the coil and fed it to himself around his shoulder the way Hana had shown him so a pull on the rope would not be a pull on the brain stem. He tied a bowline to his own belt because his hands knew that prayer now. He set the other end around the base of the old oak that had outlived three landlords and two significant weather events and had a root system philosophy books had written about in secret. The knot was not art\u2014it was the kind of clove hitch you put on when time is offended by your preferences\u2014and it held because it had to. He shouted into rain, felt ridiculous, and did it again because ridiculous is sometimes what a person is before competence changes their voice. The woman inside turned her head toward him and in the moving light he recognized Mrs. Patel from down in Evelyn\u2019s building, the one who had freaked out at the last concussion and had brought soup in jars and scolded everyone for not owning slippers.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t open the door!\u201d he yelled, feeling his mouth make shapes like kindergarten. \u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019m going to put a line on your car.\u201d The water tugged at his thighs with that muscular, intimate offense only water has when you have told it you intend to argue. He moved like he was in tall grass and found the hook on the sedan\u2019s rear frame by faith and touch and the anger of a man who has had to untie too many things for other people. He got the rope around and cinched it with a trucker\u2019s hitch he had learned from a video at two in the morning once when sleep had said no and thought, stupidly, bless every bored night I ever lived through. He pointed at Mariah, who had appeared at his shoulder with her hair plastered to her skull like a sermon, and said, \u201cTake a wrap on the oak. When I say take, take, and when I say hold, hold,\u201d and she did, because inclination toward argument dies in the blood in certain weather.\n\nHe went forward, boots sliding toward the impossible. The ditch was deeper near the culvert and the water there did the persuasive thing of trying to move his feet apart and take him down by suggesting he had ankles he didn\u2019t need. He leaned into the rope, the way he had leaned into the dock that day, and the memory burned through his body like instruction. Hana had said, \u201cKeep your body a line,\u201d in a different place, and he did. He got to the driver\u2019s side and the woman inside shook her head because everyone knows that opening a door in a river is the way you drown in it. He pounded on the glass the way you do to a neighbor you love who won\u2019t get out of bed in a fire. \u201cWindow!\u201d he shouted. \u201cJust the window.\u201d She put the button down and the water came in with the long-prepared dignity of an invited guest who has been insulted by delay. He shoved the ring buoy at her and she took it in both hands like a hymnbook and held on. \u201cOut!\u201d he said, and touched her elbow, because contact, when gentle, is a bridge shame can cross without complaint.\n\nShe was smaller than her voice, which no one had ever told her, and the cold made her breath a stuck machine. He kept her face up and his own mouth above the idiot insistence of the water and said nonsense syllables because nonsense is how you make the body allow the brain to stay. Mariah took when he said take and held when he said hold, and the rope said nothing about any of it and obeyed. He got her to the lip where the ditch had become road again, and the two of them slid in a long, expensive scrape along gravel and mud and ended in a pile of limbs and curses and tears that all belonged to the day and to none of them in particular. He lay there because lying down makes gravity seem like a friend, and the rain put cold coins on his face until he chose breath and sat up.\n\nThey got Mrs. Patel into the cab of his truck and turned the heat on like it had been invented for them personally. She kept apologizing to God and to him and to the culvert, which seemed fair, and to nobody in particular for the state of her hair, which was not. He made a joke about slippers to prove the world was intact enough to afford nonsense and she said a thing in Gujarati that meant either idiot or son and rested her head against the window like a child who will never tell anyone who saved her because she does not want to be accused of gratitude.\n\nHe drove her down to Evelyn\u2019s because that was where her spare key lived and because the jacaranda, even out of bloom, knows where bodies need to be laid down. Evelyn opened her door before he knocked because the rain had told her there would be knocking and who. She put Mrs. Patel on the couch with a blanket that had never forgiven college students for how they use couches and set a kettle on because kettles are what women who have run out of hands set on. She did not cry in the doorway; she cried in the kitchen where the dog couldn\u2019t see and came back with tea and a look on her face like the surface of a lake when a small fish jumps and no one else saw it.\n\nHe called Ruth from the landing and told her about the oak and the rope and where the car was and what the county would need to call that culvert now, and Ruth said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell them it was always like that; it will save us an argument,\u201d which was love, too.\n\nOn the way back to the hill, the roads looked like they had been drawn in pencil on wet paper, and the wipers worked like penitent men. He stopped by the lower gate and stared at the cut in the earth because awe is what you owe efficient destruction. The water would carve a new path whether he argued or not. He marked the posts with flags like priest work and told himself to pretend he enjoyed being an acolyte. Madrone met him at the door with the outrage of a being kept from work and then forgave him in a single leaning gesture that meant we are as good as we could be today.\n\nThe power went the way everyone had promised and the house forgot it had nerves. He lit the stove by match like an apology and warmed the kitchen until it felt like a temporary church. In the morning the rain paused long enough for people to think they had earned it and then took another breath, and he used the reprieve to move the flock farther up, to a pocket where water would have to explain itself to Devonian strata before it could get rude. On the way, Penny tried to convince him she had earned one last graze on a patch that wanted to be a pond, and he used a tone he had used only twice before in his life to say no.\n\nOut beyond the eucalyptus, a sound came that had never made him think of anything but time until recently: a horn, long and low, a thing thrown across space for the purpose of tidying up a distance. He stopped and listened and pictured a deck going up and down in a long pulse and hands around a mug and a rope coiling itself because a person with salt on her sleeves had told it to. He carried that sound into the afternoon like a coin in his pocket and didn\u2019t spend it on worry. At noon the rain lost interest in itself, and a light came through like good news in a family that is used to news of a different kind. He walked the orchard and found a limb that had tried to be generous under a foot of water and failed; he tied it up with a new piece of rope that did not yet know his house and told it to stay. It did.\n\nBy evening the road above the lower gate had a sawhorse with the county\u2019s signature on it, and men in jackets that implied competence stood in the rain and gestured at the hole like it was a patient who needed encouragement. The sedan had been hauled out and sat on the side with mud like a rough new paint job; he ran his hand down it like a horse and felt shame for the affection he felt for an object that had been persuaded into a kind of heroism. Mrs. Patel sent a text that had only emojis and two words, \u201cmy slippers,\u201d and he realized he was going to love her for the exact reason he had always loved women who worry about small things while the house burns down: because someone has to keep the room polite until we can again.\n\nThe storm moved south in the way important things occasionally remember other people exist. The hills exhaled. Fences leaned back into their old arguments. The dogs in the county slept because they\u2019d earned it. He slept too, hard and low, until the hour the whales sometimes make him awake, and when he woke he did not hear them because the sea had tasks that did not involve applause. He listened instead to the new creek where the old pasture had been and decided he could stand to learn a different map in his head without feeling as if he had betrayed the one he had memorized.\n\nIn the days after, the work acquired a cleanliness unusual for winter. Mud took on the moral qualities of stubbornness. He repaired the lower run from scratch because sometimes the thing to do is to refuse achievement and choose good. Mariah arrived with gloves and an apology for the way she had once used the phrase \u201cuntapped potential\u201d in a sentence about land and used herself up that afternoon pulling new line while he held staples in his teeth like a cartoon he had sworn never to become. She did not say sorry for previous brochures. She said, when they paused and the weather remembered how to warm a human face, \u201cYou were right. Time is currency. I had no idea how expensive decent things are,\u201d and he said nothing, because accepting an apology on behalf of the world is a power he does not trust himself with. She stayed until dark put its coat on and then stayed another twenty minutes because staying is how you tell someone you are learning who you are.\n\nNews from the south came in postcards of pixels. A bay so quiet it made you suspicious. A taco he could smell through a screen. A rope burn on a wrist that had been asked to hold something heavier than the wrist had believed it could. Marin sent the name of a cove that sounded like a woman who knows she can get away with a crime and does not have to try. \u201cWe anchored,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe fixed things that were not broken to make sure they knew who was in charge. We named a gull. The gull ignored us. Stay small?\u201d He wrote back, \u201cSaved a woman with a ring buoy. I will not accept hero as a job title. Dog disapproves of my restraint,\u201d and she wrote, \u201cTell the dog I have no use for heroes either, only for people who can carry water without making it about their backs.\u201d\n\nHe took Evelyn bread and got back his ring buoy with a sticker of a whale on it because Mrs. Patel had insisted that a thing that has saved a person should be decorated like a child\u2019s cast. He and Evelyn sat on the floor of her kitchen instead of the chairs because old knees are young when you treat them with humility. She told him a thing about her father he had never heard because he had always loved her in the part of her life where she didn\u2019t tell family stories unless anger made her feet move faster. He told her he had decided to forgive himself for not becoming the version of a man he had imagined at nineteen because he had never liked that man and had made him up to use as an excuse, and she said, \u201cGood,\u201d with the quiet of someone who had been waiting for a sentence for years and had decided not to nag the person who owed it. They washed dishes together because even two plates looks like ceremony when there has been water everywhere.\n\nThe hill greened in a way that was not shy. The beans, which had no business remaining alive, attempted another argument with the calendar, and he told them kindly to accept the world as it is and let him pull them. The garlic meant business in a way that would have made a sensible person sigh with relief and frightened him a little instead because competence in plants can look like arrogance if you don\u2019t watch your tone. He laid more paper around trunks because he had become the kind of man who believes in cardboard, which meant he had become the kind of man who believes in slow magic, which meant he had become the kind of man who could attend his own life properly.\n\nAt the harbor, Owen had built a shrine out of the useless pieces left from a fix that had finally become more fix than story. It wasn\u2019t a shrine, he\u2019d say; it was a box of spares. But someone had put a photograph under plexiglass and someone else had left a thermos with the lid off and a third person had stuck a little carved fool on the edge who looked like every man they knew who still believed the sea was just a large lake with better publicity. Hana wore their welt like a new tattoo and pretended to be annoyed when anyone asked. They cornered Alec by the ice machine and said, \u201cYou pulled me. Don\u2019t practice humility all the way into lying about it,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou saved yourself,\u201d and they said, \u201cI would like both things to be true,\u201d and he said, \u201cAll right,\u201d and in that moment something about his face shifted in a way even the dog noticed.\n\nHe and Ruth and Mariah went to a county meeting where men who had never leaned over a fence argued about watersheds like they were arguing about novels, and the women in the back row traded glances and weather reports. Alec said less than he had brought, which is a kind of wealth. After, in the parking lot, Mariah told a staffer in a green jacket the names of the three houses that had nearly been lost, and the staffer wrote them down like rare birds, which made Alec feel both ridiculous and seen. The staffer asked Alec what he needed and he said, \u201cGravel and time,\u201d and the staffer laughed in that bureaucratic way that means I know and I can\u2019t and sometimes I can, and then, a week later, a truck came with a load exactly large enough to make faith seem temporarily practical.\n\nThere was a morning when the fog came low and warm and the whales were audible and he had the petty impulse to keep it to himself like a sweet he\u2019d promised to share. He texted Marin anyway, because love, in its cleanest version, is a thing you give from the pantry and not from the last piece of candy you hid. She sent back, \u201cSaw a thing I will never say out loud because the ocean will hear and make me pay. Tell your dog I saw three dogs that are seals and one seal that is a dog.\u201d\n\nOn a Tuesday he found a lamb in trouble with pneumonia that had not announced itself the way books say it will, and he did the sharp work of deciding something about suffering before lunch and hated himself only a little for how easily the hands followed orders once the orders had been written. He buried it under the oak that had held his rope because contracts are made in sets. He said a sentence out loud none of his people would ever hear and felt stupid and decent simultaneously. That afternoon he went down to the bookstore and stood in the maps aisle and traced a line from the bay where the ketch might be to any point where land became inevitable, and he thought, the world is too large; then he remembered stay small and thought, all right, and chose instead a book about knots with pictures that made him want to go drink a beer with the photographer.\n\nThe day that arranged itself along a single axis, the one that had been promised by an earlier paragraph in a life that liked to foreshadow, did not start special. It began with a sock that would not dry even though the rest of the laundry had obeyed the laws of linen. It moved into a dog with a burr in an indecent place and a man and a pair of scissors negotiating whose embarrassment was owed to whom. He was halfway through fencing the east line by noon, the part that had become a theory because the earth did not agree with its own angles anymore, and he would have told anyone who asked that heroism was a vocabulary he had no intention of practicing in public again this month. The text came from a number he didn\u2019t save because he doesn\u2019t save numbers that he believes belong to situations that will go away: a ranger in Los Osos who had been at the county meeting and looked at his hands while he spoke like he was a man who could be given a job without asking for a receipt. \u201cWe have a car in the culvert under South Bay. Two inside. Fire en route but slow. We have rope and not enough of it. Someone said you know what a fence is for,\u201d the text said, and he laughed once, unwisely, because familiar phrases make the body pretend it is being blessed.\n\nHe went. Of course he went. He did not think of what people would say. He thought of water, which was no longer his enemy because enemies are a luxury he had stopped carrying along with extra pride. The culvert was exactly what anyone who has spent enough time saying that word imagines: dark water and a concrete mouth practicing a sermon about how much it could hold and still be hungry. The car had been persuaded by logic and panic to go where it could not exist; it lay pinned at an angle terribly fond of the exact mistake it had made, and inside were two faces bleached by the light of their own bad luck. The fire truck sat huffing like a tired animal, and the men and women around it moved efficiently inside the choreography they had drilled. A ranger with a rain-faded patch on his shoulder was shouting about upstream and downstream and whether or not we believe in miracles on a Tuesday.\n\nAlec took in the geometry the way his hands had learned to scan a fence line for the lie in its stance. The water ran chest high in the best imagination and over the head of any person who believed in humility. The rope on hand was good but fixed wrong; someone had made lovely knots in the wrong place with the right tenderness. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and he pointed, and no one argued because there wasn\u2019t time and his voice had learned something in the last months about where to find its own authority. He set anchors on railings that had not deserved to be useful and made them swear to God by way of a clove hitch that had seen worse and not complained. He threaded a second line under the first so a person could be a pulley and not a martyr. He tied himself without anyone offering him a dry opinion and looked at a firefighter with eyebrows that asked permission only as a courtesy. The firefighter nodded and put a hand on the rope the way a mother puts a hand on a stroller in traffic\u2014loving and possessive of the right to yank.\n\nHe went into water that tasted like every rusted thing he had considered beautiful at one point in his life and every lie he had believed about his own buoyancy. He went past the edge where a man who has been teaching himself kindness stops going and remembers he was built to be a different tool for ten minutes. He reached the rear of the car and found the glass already broken because someone else had thought ahead and thought right and cut themselves for no good reason except that they were willing. He found hair and the hard curve of a shoulder and a small voice saying I can\u2019t that made him say yes you can in a tone his body had heard in other rooms and obeyed. He did not know their names. He did not ask. He did the one thing he could do\u2014make a knot hold fast around another human\u2019s stubbornness\u2014and then he was pulled in the right direction by competent strangers, which is the closest thing to a religious experience he is willing to admit to.\n\nThey came out of the culvert into light that had the gall to be grey instead of gold. The faces of the people around him arranged themselves into that good shape, the one that is not a smile and not a sob but the place in the middle that means we continue. He went back once more because her husband, or brother, or the man who had promised something he meant at the time, was still trapped by a belt he would have mocked all last week, and he cut it because sometimes safety is a threat when it persists past its usefulness. He did not think he could do it twice. He did it twice. He came up a second time feeling like a rope himself, chafed and mean, and someone caught him under the arms and someone else held his head the way you hold a bird you are about to teach not to die. On the bank, the ranger with the patch that had been at the meeting put a hand on his shoulder and pressed with a pressure that meant both stay and go and said, in the middle of twelve other instructions shouted to the rest of the day, \u201cFence,\u201d and Alec laughed like a man who would cry later in a room by himself or not.\n\nHe did cry, later, because this is a life in which tears happen in rooms that have nothing to do with the reason. He cried in the tack room where the smell of old leather made every decision feel older and wiser than it had been when made. He cried with the dog\u2019s nose at his knee and the sound of rain in the gutters improving no one\u2019s mood. He cried like a man whose hands had finally been formally introduced to his heart, and both had been decent at the meeting.\n\nThat evening, Ruth came up with a bottle of something that had the word rye on it and the look of something that had been distilled by a grandfather who claimed to have learned it in the war. She poured two fingers into cups unworthy of the job and said nothing at first because she is a woman who knows when to stop saving her words. \u201cHeard,\u201d she said at last. \u201cSaw.\u201d She knocked her knuckles against the table like she was impressing good luck into its old wood. \u201cIt won\u2019t always be you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be. But once in a while I\u2019d like it to be. I\u2019d like to live in a county where men who know how to tie knots don\u2019t pretend they only know chores.\u201d He raised his cup without humor and took a sip that made his throat decide whether to forgive him, and it did.\n\nA message came from the south after midnight. It was only a photograph at first\u2014the kind that ocean people take when the light passes through the thin part at the horizon and makes a blue that land doesn\u2019t know how to pronounce. Then, text: \u201cCrossed between islands I did not know had names. Saw water misbehave and behave with equal skill. Heard your county gossip from a pelican. It says you argued with a culvert and won. I am making you a knot when I get back, not for rope, for your wall. I will teach it to remember itself without you. Stay small,\u201d she wrote, and below it, as if her thumb had decided truth needed punctuation, \u201cProud of you, shepherd.\u201d\n\nHe went outside because walls made his skin too careful just then. The stars were doing what they could. The hill smelled like what happens when a long argument ends because both parties remember the other has a right to exist. He put his hand on the post that had the smallest rope burn from the storm and the rescue and thought not of heroism but of repetition, and not of fame but of habit, and of how habit can be the honest version of love if you are stubborn about where you build it. Down in the dark, the new creek held to its course like a vow, and out beyond his hearing the sea wrote its letter to the coast in long hand. He stood in the clean night and let the animal called fear, which he had taught as best he could, come and sit, and then lie down, and then stay. He was, for a minute that did not need measuring, a man inside his life with a dog beside him and rope burns on his hands that would look like nothing tomorrow and feel like everything now, and that was exactly the right size for a god.",

The creek that had moved into the lower pasture decided to keep its new address and stopped arguing at the fence line; it hummed like a sewing machine in the hours when light turns animal. The hill grew the thin green that makes a person think they are generous just for getting out of bed and not stepping on anything too tender. On the first morning of the month, a rabbit sat in the open like confidence with ears and the dog did not chase it because Madrone had begun to understand the difference between a thing you want and a thing you will forgive yourself for wanting later. Alec made coffee that tasted like he had remembered how much water wanted to be involved in small, decent rituals, and he stood by the sink and watched the fog pretend to be smoke and then stop pretending.\n\nHe had never been a man who marked anniversaries properly, but the county had been putting dates on his calendar without asking, and he had learned to read them whether he wanted to or not. He took a length of cotton rope from the hook by the door and set it on the table and smoothed it with the heel of his hand like hair before a photograph. He made a knot in it\u2014not a bowline, which had become a prayer he didn\u2019t say for sport, but a carrick bend whose shameless beauty had been shown to him by a sailor with a tenderness for complicated truths. He flattened it and made sure it sat like a tidy piece of honesty, and then he hung it on a nail by the window where the first slant of morning would find it and then leave it alone. He did not tell anyone he had put it there; he liked the idea of a thing that understood him without asking to be seen.\n\nWork came the way work always does when the weather begins to consider changing its mind; it came in notes tucked under rocks and trucks that eased into the drive and people who stood with their hands in their pockets and their shoulders offering apology in one direction and demand in the other. A man from the county with a green jacket, the one who had written down the names like rare birds, arrived with a smile that had learned to be useful. He brought cones and a sign and two laborers who had opinions about the correct density of gravel and enough patience to listen while the oak told them who had lived here before all of them. Mariah showed up with a shovel and the kind of focus you get when you have recently chosen a side and are still checking your choice against the weather. Ruth stood with her weight on one hip and her braid defiant and told the men where to put the rock and where to keep their boots off the root flare, and the men listened because she had the air of a person who knows the difference between authority and a performance of it in a borrowed coat.\n\nThey filled in the bite the storm had taken with something that would keep the road honest until the county could pretend to afford permanence. Alec ran guide lines from fence post to fence post so that trucks with an exaggerated sense of their own width would behave like models for a day. He handled rope in public now without pretending he had stumbled into its company by mistake; he tied and untied like a person who had made peace with being good at a thing that could make him useful in the kind of way that scares a man into becoming more or less himself. When the day was dull enough to disguise the satisfaction of completion, they stood and looked at the repaired edge, and the rain that threatened and didn\u2019t come hung over them like gossip. Mariah kicked the toe of her boot at the line of gravel where it met earth and said she had brought too little thanks for too large a day. Ruth said the thanks had been in the showing up, and the man in the green jacket nodded because sometimes the truth is so plain it takes three different kinds of hands to make it believable.\n\nShearing came like a drumbeat in the middle of a week that had otherwise decided on whispering. The shearer was a man with a back that had made its agreements long ago; he folded himself to the work with that particular grace that people who are always close to the ground develop and do not show off. The sheep became less themselves and then more; Penny shot him a look she had acquired the previous year, the one that said she did not forgive the negotiation but would resume friendship very soon. Madrone moved slow in the shed and kept her eye in that soft out-of-focus the dog knows how to wear when the animals need to forget there is a predator in the room. The wool came away in living blankets that looked like something a proper god might have been born on, and the lanolin made his hands smell like a promise he could not keep but wanted to try at. He bagged fleeces and laid them out, admiring the way a body makes a map of itself without asking for applause. In the afternoon, he washed with a sliver of homemade soap Ruth had left in his mailbox last spring, and the smell of sheep left him slowly, the way a day leaves your clothes when you had done it right.\n\nHe drove one of the bags down to the bookstore because it turns out a store that sells ideas can also sell the way animals remember winter. Evelyn had, of course, already cleared a corner and put down a sign written in her small, bossy hand: \u201cLocal Wool for People Who Like To Be Warm on Purpose.\u201d She teased him about his sudden confidence with notions, and he told her not to say notions in a town with as many old men as this one, and they laughed until a child with beautiful and impossible hair told them to quiet down so she could listen to the sound the wool made when she touched it. Evelyn\u2019s bruise had faded into a coloration that made her look like a person who had earned a story and was not going to overuse it. The basil plant had accepted winter without complaint and had become the kind of tidy death that makes you like plants again; she had put the pot on a high shelf and stuck in it the plastic fork from a dinner three apartments ago with a note that read \u201cSpring.\u201d He liked the way the word looked, a private dare tucked into ordinary life.\n\nThe memorial for the man the water had taken was what these towns do when they are trying to keep their faces still and useful: a collection of thermoses, a song sung badly and with devotion, a board with photographs that had been printed on a machine that smelled like hot plastic and provided proof of being loved. It happened at the harbor under a sky that had decided to cooperate for once, and the people who kept boats and kept grudges and kept faith all wore their hats either too tight or too loose and no one made a rule about it. Owen gave a speech that started as a denial and became a confession and ended with a joke young enough that it made the old men grab their knees. Hana stood without the armor of irony and read three sentences written in a hand that had been taught to behave by engineering school and ruined by the sea in exactly the right way, and when they said the man\u2019s name the gulls laughed because gulls don\u2019t know anything except how to remind you you are not the center. Alec stayed to the side because the side is where he can see everything without making anyone do the work of noticing him; he accepted paper cups of coffee and nodded at men who needed nods, and when it was over he took a coil no one needed, untied the terrible knots some stranger had made, and put it away right, a private prayer in three motions.\n\nShe wrote from a weather that had decided to allow postcards again. The messages were not long and that made them better; she sent him the name of a town that tasted like dust in his mouth and promised a harbor and delivered a haul-out yard where men swore in two languages and the gossip knit everyone\u2019s mistakes into something almost noble. She sent a picture of a hand\u2014hers, he knew it now by the way the knuckles argued with work\u2014holding a fish scale in sunlight, whole as a coin. She wrote once in a mood he recognized now, the one where leaving has been renamed continuing because no one can survive the drama of it otherwise, and said the engine had finally made a virtue of humility and that Shorty had told a story about a hurricane that sounded like a sermon translated into a better religion. He carried his phone in his shirt pocket, close enough to hear it scold him when it wanted to, and sometimes he brought it out in the orchard and set it on a fence post as if it were a bird he had trained. He spoke out loud less often than he had the month before, but when he did it sounded like the version of him he had decided to protect.\n\nThe creek kept making itself respectable and then reminded him it hadn\u2019t gone to school for it. He went down with a shovel on a day that threatened to be golden and dug a small channel where a ridiculous eddy kept pulling branches into a private conversation; he encouraged the water the way you encourage a child who wants to become opinionated about doorways. He built a footbridge because he had always wanted to and because it was wrong to ask the dog to make a leap every time he needed eggs from the neighbor\u2019s birds. He made it out of salvaged cedar and bolts he had found in an old coffee tin with a label that said \u201cSummer 2004\u201d in a handwriting he didn\u2019t recognize. The first time he walked across it, it made the sound of a polite cough; the second time, it said nothing, which meant it had accepted its purpose. He thought briefly of naming it and then didn\u2019t because names for bridges are like names for tools; the only ones that matter are the names you say when something goes wrong.\n\nHe took more to carrying a small coil looped at his hip like a man in a cartoon he\u2019d promised himself he wouldn\u2019t become and had become anyway. It turned out rope makes strangers into the same kind of person for a while; men who would not otherwise speak asked him how he liked the lay and whether he preferred manila for beauty even though it rots or poly for its soulless stubbornness. He said he liked what worked and then told them why, and the telling made a sound like citizens learning to settle their own disputes without the sheriff. Women asked him to tie things and then watched his hands and then asked him to teach them to tie things, and he did, because he wanted someone to haul him off a plan later without having to give a speech about equality first. He tied a climber\u2019s hitch for a girl on a bicycle whose smile had the problem of being bigger than her face and watched her bind a ridiculous load of cardboard in a way that would make gravity ashamed of itself.\n\nOn a fogless Saturday that had no business pretending to be any other day, a man with a pickup that had almost forgiven the last twenty years of its life pulled in with a trailer and three panels of used hog wire, and it took Alec a second to recognize Owen without the boat under him rearranging his angles. Owen had the look of someone close to salt who has been cheated of it; he stood there blinking as if he\u2019d taken off sunglasses he\u2019d finally learned to wear and did not know where to put his eyes. They shook hands in a way that said I saw you when your mouth was making a strange shape and chose not to punish you for it, and then Owen pretended to need wire cutters and Alec pretended to find some, and they repaired a stupid length of fence that did not need repairing before noon. After, they sat on the tailgate with their feet in the dirt and drank something brown that belonged in better cups. Owen said as little as a man can and still keep a friend, and Alec did not demand more. He learned that the boat had learned a new noise and then another and that both had been wooed into quiet. He learned that the town with the harbor with no patience had the best beans he\u2019d ever eaten and that Marin, who had always taken sun like a woman taking a dare, had acquired a hat she now wore without apology. Owen did not ask about the river or the culvert or what it feels like to make choices in the dark; he stared at the lower pasture and said the new creek looked like it had found work it liked.\n\nHe let himself be within arm\u2019s reach of Evelyn again in ways that would have made him nervous a year ago and now made him proud because fear is an animal you can tack a saddle to if you treat it properly. She came up with a galley book that fell apart in the car and asked for tape, and he watched her find the end of it the way he watched the dog find the scent when scent had gone cruel and he learned nothing from either that he could explain. She had stopped naming the basil plant in a way that made him avoid the window, and she had begun referring to a travel book no one bought as \u201cabsurdly brave,\u201d which made him say quietly that perhaps the book only had a terrible title and she said, fine, all right, perhaps that is what we are all calling it now. They did not talk about the night at the clinic and he did not talk about the culvert, and between those two silences something that had been loose for years quietly learned to sit.\n\nThere were small mercies in the mail and small insults too, because the world is very fond of being thorough. He got an envelope with a return address that looked like a lighthouse and inside was a permit that had learned to approve him and his bridge on a probationary basis; it was signed by a man whose shoes had never seen this dirt, and Alec laughed anyway because wearing a name printed by a bureaucracy feels like being blessed by a bored god. He also got a thin letter from a woman in an office with a photograph of a plant on her desk advising him that his lease would need to be renegotiated by a person who had not yet been hired, with a list of meetings attached that read like tests. He took the letters down to the shed because the shed had become a place where paper surrendered its arrogance; he wrote two drafts of something he needed to say to Mariah and two drafts of something he needed to not say to himself and then went back to the day which did not care about any of it but made provision for his mood in the way the day does when it thinks you are trying in good faith.\n\nOne afternoon that had been assigned to errands and thus improved by being abandoned to work, he found a ewe with a peculiar tilt to her head and an expression that suggested either new hearing or old infection. He took the antibiotics out into the field like a disgrace and delivered the dosage with more apology than medicine can usually tolerate. He sat with her afterward because a person can apologize with their body after they have asked a body to accept the indignity of becoming better. The dog lay in a slump with her chin on her paws and watched the part of the sky where hawks like to browse, and when the ewe stood up and shook in the way a sheep shakes, which makes the animal look as if it is trying to become multiple and failing cheerfully, Alec laughed out loud and did not take it back.\n\nHe did not intend to build a bench, but he built one, because the place by the apples had been hinting for weeks that it was selfish to keep making a person stand. The bench was made out of two halves of something else and a slab that had once believed itself to be a shelf; it was too heavy and not heavy enough, which is a respectable way to be a seat. He placed it where the branches would know the weight of someone thinking, and he sat and discovered that from here you could see the place where the ridge blacked against the sea on days when the fog was in a generous mood, and on other days you could see nothing but the interior of a thought and the way the dog checked back every third minute in case sitting had become distress. He imagined people who were not him sitting here when he was not here; he pictured Ruth\u2019s niece with her arms folded in calculation and Owen with salt in his eyebrows again in a season where the boat had returned, and Evelyn with a book, reading out loud by accident when the sentence in front of her surprised her into lending it her mouth. He pictured Marin with her hat in her hands because the wind is a thief even in this little hollow and only thieves treat thieves well.\n\nThe fox came back and did what foxes do, which is to sit in the boundary between ownership and accident and pretend to ignore you while being very interested indeed. Madrone regarded the fox with the respect one professional gives another, and Alec took his hands out of his pockets because he had recently learned that his hands have better manners when they are allowed to make themselves useful. He checked the garlic and found it too confident by half, which pleased him; he pinched back the flower heads and felt the plant insist on its project anyway, which is the only way anything earns your respect. The beans he had told to give up months ago sent one last green question mark into the air and he answered it with a laugh and a thumb and a promise that he would give it its due in the spring when the soil decided to accept liberally again.\n\nSometimes the sea disappeared for days in his head, and he decided this was health and not neglect. It came back in noises that had arranged themselves into meaning without his asking. It came back in a gull flung resembled less a bird than a brag. It came back in a call from Owen who rarely called, because calling is a naked act and men who have been cold do not undress easily. \u201cLa Paz,\u201d he said, and Alec could hear the beginning of a smile that had not asked permission. \u201cThey have a band that plays every song as if it is about the moon, and the moon agrees to the arrangement. She ate something that claimed to be ceviche and was not, and did not complain like a child for once. We are going to fix a thing that isn\u2019t yet broken and I am going to pretend it\u2019s about prudence.\u201d Alec said he hoped for fairgoing and that if Owen saw a man with a tattoo of a shrimp reading a book to a cat, he should not follow him, and Owen swore in a pleased way and said it was good to have a person who knew how to lie properly into a telephone.\n\nWord went around that a kid from up the road had begun to come by at dusk to pat the sheep and explain to them about letters, and Alec decided that children talking to animals about the alphabet was either nonsense or the exact way to develop a better county in fifteen years. He watched the boy, who had the posture of an apology and a laugh like someone had already given him permission to be proud, and he said nothing. He let the teaching happen and made sure the gate was shut behind it, and when the boy went home with his hair static and the dog following him half to the road, Alec stood for a minute and practiced being grateful without making a ceremony of it.\n\nThe first blossom on the earliest apple opened without noise and with the kind of nerve only small things get away with. He bent to it and inhaled in a way that made sense to his mother\u2019s ghost and probably to no one else, and he tasted a sweetness that had nothing to do with courtship and everything to do with effort. He did not text the picture to anyone, which was a new privacy he did not bother to compliment himself for; he held it with his eyes and then put it down where he knew he would find it later, the way a person puts down a tool they will need when the light has gone and the hands expect to be guided.\n\nHe set himself to learning two new knots because there is no virtue in sticking with the ones that have recently saved you. He learned a constrictor knot because it is what you use when you want to say no without a speech and to be believed, and he learned a zeppelin bend because what an arrogant name, and because sometimes you tie two ends that don\u2019t want to admit they are equal and you have to make them shake hands. He practiced on the bench and on the kitchen chair and around the leg of the table with the gouge in it from a night ten years ago that had not gone well; he practiced on the fence post by the old oak until his fingers could make the pattern without him looking, and then he left the rope there in a lazy curve and went to check the salt lick because leaving work on purpose is a way of saying you respect the animal of yourself that never, ever clocks out.\n\nOn a morning when birds tried on their spring voices like suits in a mirror and kept some and put others back, he found Mariah at the orchard with a notebook and a face that suggested she had made a list she was embarrassed to share. She told him her cousin had called twice and had used the phrase \u201chighest and best use\u201d like a clean towel to wipe his hands on after dirtying them with imagination. She said she had thought for a day and a night and half the next day and had come up here to see how garlic complicates a person\u2019s positions. She said that the highest use of a place might be the slowest use, and that she had begun to inventory the kinds of wealth that still work if the power goes out, and he did not congratulate her because a body making up its mind deserves not to be clapped for while it does it. He pointed out where the creek had decided to be and the way the trees had accepted the new grammar without whining, and he asked her to sit, and she did, and the bench did not complain; it held both their weight and the weight of the part of the conversation that will probably always be heavier than two people are good for.\n\nHe tried the bridge in the dark because bridges ought to pass their own tests. He took the dog and a flashlight and the kind of attention you spend like currency when a day wants a premium. The creek spoke in full sentences now and said rude things about erosion and the way humans behave with tools, and he listened without thinking he could improve the water\u2019s manners. They crossed, dog first and then man, and on the way back the sky broke open just enough to show him a gap through which something bright reminded him that even in months when the sea stays far in the ear, a person has access to light. He turned off the flashlight and stood very still and let his body discover how valuable a small motion can be when the rest of the world is finally in its chair.\n\nHe woke to the smell of a letter from the south before he heard the phone do its little cough. She had sent a photograph of a fish scale again, this one balanced on the back of her hand in a way that made him want to ask the world whether it would mind holding still another minute. She wrote, \u201cI watched a man tie a bend with his eyes closed because the light was too honest and he didn\u2019t want to embarrass himself in front of his own hands. I thought of your bench. I thought of the hill. Tell the dog there are pelicans who are trying to become dogs and need supervision.\u201d He wrote back, \u201cDog reports readiness to inspect pelicans for intention. Bridge holds. Garlic brags. County making a face like a man who\u2019s agreed to do better. Stay small,\u201d and she answered, \u201cNothing else fits,\u201d and sent a picture of a hat hung on a bulkhead like a temporary flag.\n\nHe did not miss the shape of crisis, which is worrisome, and he said so to the dog, who stared back and licked her nose because dogs know that language is a leash and a bone and a promise to get it right next time. He missed the attention he had learned to pay, and so he found new ways to pay it: by being first to the gate in the morning and last to the sink at night, by counting his posts without letting repetition become a narcotic, by teaching the boy from up the road how to coil rope in an oval and not a circle because different shapes keep different memories. He allowed boredom to flirt with him and then told it he was busy, and boredom, being dignified in its way, found someone else.\n\nThe fox left two prints on the step and a leaf as if delivering late mail. A coyote sang behind the shed in a voice that made him think of first wives and promises that had been made in a tone entirely correct for the moment and wrong for the year. He sent a bag of apples, the last, down to the harbor with a note that said \u201cfor hands and for Shorty\u2019s bad temper,\u201d and he got back a photograph of a loaf that had no right to be that proud in that weather and he could smell it through the screen for a minute and no more. The whales made themselves uncertain again and then very certain and then went on, because creatures with good maps don\u2019t need you to clap for them.\n\nHe found himself in the shed one afternoon when the light made every spider web a criticism and every tool a confession, and he picked up the rope from the hook and tied two lengths together and then untied them again and again until he felt his breath stop arguing. He thought maybe heroism was a scarecrow he had been asked to stand up in a field that didn\u2019t need one, and maybe what he had instead was the kind of decency that gets built into ligaments by repetition. He thought of a boat moving south with a woman on it who knew how to make a knot behave, and he thought of a bookstore where a woman he had not yet learned how to be useful to in all the necessary ways nonetheless let him carry a box without comment. He thought of a county that would keep coming to his door because it had learned his name and his habit of answering even when he should not, and he reminded himself to sit on the bench and feel the wood threaten to go soft one day and that there is no insult in that.\n\nToward the end of the month the hills went the particular green that makes you reckless, and the old men at the auction yard began telling the same jokes they\u2019d told last year, which is what passes for liturgy in a place where lots of things still have to be done by hand. He drove down to the pier on a weekday no one had thought to decorate with a holiday and stood at the end with his palms on the rail and his eyes trying to see beyond the place where sight likes to submit. The water had a face like a person who has learned to share a house and still insists on rearranging the furniture. A gull landed nearby with the confidence of a councilman and eyed his pockets in case any of them had decided to become fish. Alec had nothing for the bird and the bird had nothing for him except its refusal to be ashamed of wanting; it was a fair trade.\n\nOn his way back up he stopped at a hardware store that had never forgiven itself for letting you find anything on the first try and bought a handful of bolts and two lengths of chain and a little brass bell he told himself was for the gate so he would stop spending afternoons wondering whether it was open. He put the bell up that evening while the dog hunted for frogs with the careful enthusiasm of an amateur, and when the wind pushed through in its mild evening personality and the bell made its practical sound, he felt the day settle the way a dog settles before sleep\u2014two turns, a sigh, a set of small adjustments no one has any right to criticize.\n\nHe slept unevenly that night and woke twice thinking he had left something alive in the wrong place. He got up both times and went out with a flashlight and found exactly what should have been where it should have been, which did not cure the habit but allowed it to feel less powerful. On the second waking, the sky was so full of stars it looked like a fabric he had seen once in a shop full of dresses he could not afford for a person he had not married, and he laughed in the yard because history sometimes shows up dressed in clothes you thought you\u2019d burned. The creek spoke less like a lecture now and more like an old person who is making sense only if you know them well, and he did, so it did, and he went back in and slept until the dog pawed his shoulder to say it was morning.\n\nThe day that showed up next looked like nothing from a distance and like everything up close, which is, if he was being honest, the kind of day he had once fled. He made a sandwich and a list and left the list on the table and took the sandwich out to the bench and ate it while a bee disrespected the rules and worked in a blossom it had not paid to get into. He put his hand on the knot hanging by the window when he went back inside because it had started to feel like a bell rope inside his chest\u2014pull, and the day sings; leave it, and the day hums anyway. He looked around the small room where his life had the nerve to be happening well and thought, briefly and accurately, that he was being allowed to stay. He told the rope thank you and did not tell anyone he had said it, and he went out to put his hands where the land had insisted they go when he signed that paper under the cabinet a year ago, which turned out to be the best handwriting he possessed.",
