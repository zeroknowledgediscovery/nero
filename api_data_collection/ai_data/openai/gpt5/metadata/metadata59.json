     "novel_text": "They rang the midnight bell with broken knuckles so that it sounded like a man trying not to cry. We had to listen. Everyone in the city did, even those who slept underground and the ones who pretended not to care. Sound does strange things when the cobbles are slick and the air is arguing with itself. It gets into seams and screws and folds you didn't know you had. It collects.\n\nI stood beneath the colonnade of the Observatory, watching the bell's bronze throat swing through the low clouds, and tried to imagine what the city would look like if it ever unplugged itself from the moon. You can make a city forget the sun if you work slowly enough. They had. The Night Registry\u2014our good Masters\u2014kept us in the long dusk; a liturgy of curfews and gentle veils and a clever, constant throb of newsreels about voluntary cooperation. Vampires only like certainty, which in this case means they write the rules and we sign them in our blood.\n\nI knew the rules better than most. I wrote part of them. Not the words\u2014the binding. My job was to stitch the spells into the law so neatly that you couldn\u2019t tug at a thread without gnawing your own fingers off. We call it jurisprudence and call ourselves wizards so we can sleep.\n\n\u201cMaster Kade,\u201d said the clerk who had come to fetch me. Hers was a voice that trembled but did not break. \u201cThe Exsanguinary Conveners are waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am here,\u201d I said, which was technically true. Sometimes that comforted people. Sometimes it only comforted me.\n\nThey had convened in the Apse of the Clock, which had never been a church but always pretended to be. The walls were black marble streaked with a mineral that caught light like the underside of a raven\u2019s wing. Closest thing to a sunrise we had now. Above the dais, the huge, nonfunctional clock face stared out with no hands, no numerals, just an emptiness where time had once been allowed to happen. It had a presence like a wound in a statue.\n\nThey sat in a half-circle: Archon Mire, whose mouth was always a secret carved too carefully; Sevrin in gray silk; the Countess of Sugared Bones, who was younger than the others by two centuries and tried not to show it; a pair of junior nocturnals who took notes in a shorthand that reminded me of teeth marks. There were others, lurking. There always were.\n\nI bowed and did not lower my eyes. You can look vampires in the eye if they\u2019ve invited you; otherwise it\u2019s like stepping onto a railway and hoping the train is polite.\n\n\u201cKade,\u201d said Mire, his voice the old stone of a cistern. \u201cOne of ours dies at sunrise.\u201d\n\nI didn't correct him. They didn\u2019t do slips, nor metaphors, nor any fun. They were telling me something; it was my job to deduce which thing. \u201cWhose sunrise?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had those around here for a while.\u201d\n\nSevrin smiled without showing teeth. \u201cA figurative one. Which would become literal if\u2026 remedial actions are not undertaken. We are not disposed to let it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemedial actions,\u201d I said, as if tasting the words might explain them. \u201cYou have a fever and you want me to draw your blood.\u201d\n\nThe Countess laughed once, small and bright. It died on the black marble.\n\n\u201cGeneral Tomas Vale,\u201d said Mire. He put the name into the room like a knife placed on a table. Marine steel, careful engraving, meant for use. \u201cHe speaks tomorrow at the river amphitheater. No one attends such events without our consent, as you know, and yet this\u2014this pageant of dawn\u2014has collected more than tolerable noise. There are pamphlets. Chants. People behaving as though they had opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s honorable,\u201d I said without thinking. An error. The junior nocturnals stopped writing for one heartbeat. Sevrin\u2019s smile cooled.\n\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Mire said. \u201cHe believes in some code, and that code has made him unpredictable. We had an understanding with him, once. A balance. But he has declared the old tithes unconscionable and encourages disobedience in those we\u2026 govern. He is no longer useful alive. It would be gory to simply remove him onstage. Too visible. We require deniability. We require a mechanism. We require you.\u201d\n\nHe reached into his coat and laid a small glass phial beside the knife-name. Thick red liquid clung to the sides; when it slid, it did not care about gravity.\n\n\u201cYou want a geas,\u201d I said. \u201cBlood-anchored and time-locked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want him to die by the turning of a wheel he cannot see,\u201d Sevrin said. \u201cA wheel that touches him only because it must. We want the wheel in your hands.\u201d\n\nI could have said no. There are always choices. Some of them are only offered to see if you still remember that word.\n\nI don\u2019t remember sitting. My body knows the Protocol when the Protocol is near. Some old script lit up behind my teeth, an itch like a candle wanting to be snuffed. The phial pulsed. I had done this before. Not on someone decent. Not by this method.\n\n\u201cWhat is the anchor?\u201d I asked. My mouth had gone dry and my hands had decided to be very still. \u201cIt must share breath with him. Blood or hearth. A name he cannot remove.\u201d\n\nSevrin pushed a second object across the black glass: a picture, glossy and warm from a pocket. He did it without any counterfeit of pleasure. Vampires don\u2019t like to pretend to be happy. They consider it undignified.\n\nShe had my eyes.\n\nNo, that was a lie. She had the eyes I had always found in mirrors when I carelessly expected to see my father. People tell themselves the wrong stories to make the world line up. But the tilt of the mouth, that stubborn slant of the shoulders as if the air was meant to be pushed aside\u2014those were mine. And the hair, which refused to be persuaded by comb or knife.\n\n\u201cKaia,\u201d I said, and the name was a dropped glass smoking itself out on the floor.\n\n\u201cYour daughter,\u201d said Mire. \u201cRaised outside the Registry\u2019s parameters. Unregistered. Clever. A... repairer of old machines and dead radios. If we were told the truth.\u201d He looked at Sevrin. \u201cWere we?\u201d\n\nSevrin nodded once. \u201cMostly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe has been in the company of General Vale\u2019s circle for some months,\u201d continued Mire as if we were discussing weather. \u201cThey believe she can wire sound into miracles. She designed the amplification array he will use tomorrow. Did you know that she climbs the old cranes at the docks as if there were stairs?\u201d\n\nI did know. I could not say how I knew without telling them about the nights I stood at the edge of the salvage yard and listened for her laugh, the way some people look up at apartment windows out of habit, not hope. I could not. I breathed, and the air had been filed down.\n\n\u201cShe is his anchor, then,\u201d I said, and made the sentence as taut as a guitar string you are scared to pluck. \u201cYou are offering me the blood that binds him to his stage, and the spell runs through that binding. He dies when she does.\u201d\n\nThe room didn\u2019t tilt. It didn\u2019t need to. The world has very good balance, until you push it.\n\nSevrin moved the phial a centimeter toward me. \u201cThe geas requires, to operate as intended: two names, three equal breaths, one witness, and a single act.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are insane.\u201d That was not what I\u2019d meant to say. I meant to recite the statutes, to show them the piece of the law where this couldn\u2019t be done, to find an out in the baroque network of their own rules. But the rules always contain a rule about themselves. The rules teach you how to lose. \u201cNo consent, no\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou signed the oath,\u201d said Mire softly. \u201cIn that room with no windows. You tasted the silver leaf. You consented to use any instruments necessary to keep the peace of the Night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not keep the peace with my daughter\u2019s pulse,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou kept it with other people\u2019s pulses for twenty years,\u201d said the Countess very gently. \u201cIt is not odd that the measure circles back.\u201d\n\nThey had planned this and they were enjoying parts of it. But not all. Mire\u2019s fingers were steady on the phial; Sevrin\u2019s were not. They, too, disliked unpredictability. I was very unpredictable.\n\n\u201cI left her for this,\u201d I said. It was a confession or a curse. \u201cSo that she would not have to know any of this. So that she would not be a door you could open with my name. I made it very clear to whoever was listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife is full of doors,\u201d said Sevrin. \u201cDo not make the mistake of believing there are only the ones you see.\u201d\n\nI was already making calculations. Hypothetical trajectories you could step into like alleys. If I took the job, the geas would coil around my bones and make them ring when I tried to walk a different way. If I refused, they would do it themselves. They would find someone else and also, as a matter of principle and pedagogy, make me watch. Vampires understand drama. They stage their lessons for an audience of one.\n\nKaia. Visible and whole as she had been the last time I saw her, at a distance, her hand on a rusted-out crane like a conductor resting fingers on an instrument before beginning. She had taken her mother\u2019s name. She had made a life that did not require mine to be true. She was the best thing I had done and the worst. I did not think that was unusual for fathers.\n\n\u201cWhat do you gain killing Vale this way?\u201d I asked without quite moving my mouth. \u201cIt is not your style. You make people disappear into tidy boxes with seals no one can break. You do not hang the dawn around a child\u2019s throat and call it jewelry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDramaturgy,\u201d said the Countess. \u201cIf a saint dies for someone\u2019s sins, the crowd sees how heavy the sins must be. They will recoil. Vale will be the one who kills her. Not us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruth is a tool,\u201d said Mire. \u201cCivility is a costume. We cannot keep either if people like Vale insist on running about naked.\u201d\n\nI stood up. Sat down. That was not how bodies work but it was what happened. My breath came in precise increments; I would later remember to be grateful for the precision. That is always when I count\u2014the edges of things. I looked at the picture again, though I didn\u2019t want to. Kaia sat cross-legged on a railing with a coil of copper wire around her neck like a scarf. She had painted her nails black and smudged the polish by touching something before it was dry. Careless, careful child.\n\n\u201cI will not do this,\u201d I said, and felt a bone in my throat crack.\n\n\u201cDo not mistake your role,\u201d Mire said, and the air cooled by a small but definable measure. \u201cYour role does not ask whether. It asks how. It rewards skill.\u201d\n\nHe tipped the phial and the liquid made no sound against glass. It was too thick. It moved with intent. That was what made it binding.\n\n\u201cI am that child\u2019s father,\u201d I said, and last words looked for my tongue and did not find it.\n\n\u201cYou are what we made you,\u201d said Mire.\n\nTime did a trick like folding napkins. The protocols woke and I could feel them in the hollows of my wrists. The itch moved higher, into the jaw hinge, into the behind of the eyes. The world kept perfect time; the clock without hands laughed at me.\n\n\u201cWho told you where she is?\u201d I asked.\n\nSevrin\u2019s eyelids lowered, a small dent in a smooth thing. \u201cShe is not a careful fugitive. Careless & careful. You know this. The resistance is full of people who assume their nobility will be sufficient to confound the necessary. They do not know yet, Kade. They are still people who can gawk at an auditorium and believe they are in a temple. They still glow when they use words like justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cJustice is a word that does not belong to you,\u201d I said.\n\nHe looked weary. I almost pitied him. \u201cNor to you anymore, old friend.\u201d\n\nThe word friend caught in my teeth like a splinter of bone. He and I had played chess for years in rooms that smelled of ink and dust and the shy sweat of acolytes carrying armfuls of doctrine. He had introduced me to the taste of ferrisweet\u2014apple slices soaked in iron water to school the tongue away from sugar. He had brought salty dried plums to Kaia once, when she was small and impressionable and assumed every adult who looked at her kindly was a field she could plant a flag in. She had called him Uncle Sevrin.\n\nI think\u2014if you boil the world long enough things float to the surface. Sevrin\u2019s face floated now and I saw not a vampire\u2019s patient blankness but the man he had been two hundred years ago, when someone had decided to fetch him from death and dress him in a finer one. He had brought me into this work because he believed I could do math without lying. Irony was going to chew his throat to ribbon one night and he would thank it for the lesson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I said, because there were only two choices and this one would allow me to redraw the map while pretending to follow it.\n\nThe phial warmed in my hand. It felt like holding a wintering bird. It drenched my palm with a heat that did not pass into me. It didn\u2019t want to. A subtle contempt. The geas would use me and it would deny me.\n\nThey led me to the side chamber with no doors and a single drain in the middle of the floor. Such rooms are all alike. You can identify a government by its drains.\n\nSevrin stood with me and the Countess watched from the threshold. Mire did not enter. He disliked viscera and spells because he disliked all forms of mess that could not be cataloged; blood has too much imagination.\n\n\u201cI will be careful with the breath-count,\u201d Sevrin said softly. \u201cYou always insisted we do it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should not be here,\u201d I told him. \u201cThis is mine. Regardless of what comes after.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been here for so many things that did not belong to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be here now. Call it\u2014penance.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t believe in penance. He believed in consequences. That was different. I nodded to him anyway.\n\nWe said Kaia\u2019s name. The first breath condenses the world. The second convinces it. The third cuts.\n\n\u201cYour hands are shaking,\u201d the Countess said to Sevrin, but it was a performative whisper. She wanted me to hear.\n\n\u201cThe city is cold,\u201d he said, and in that, at least, we all agreed.\n\nI added Vale\u2019s name. I stitched it into the binding just so, you see, at just such an angle, a twist here, a loop there. A name is not a word; it is a map. I misdrew it\u2014no, that is not the word. I redrew it. I drew a map that included an alley and a door and a staircase only I could see. I did this not with my hands but with the part of me that never coughs or trembles. The shining, precise part that is only ever sure.\n\nWhen you have done this work for so long that you smell like laws in your sleeping hair, you learn to leave yourself lockpicks. You learn to encrypt your shame.\n\nIt cost me. I could feel the cost with every syllable, like a nail hammered into a heel. I coughed and coughed until something ragged came up and lay cupped beneath my tongue like a coin. Sevrin steadied me with fingers on my elbow; that old kindness again.\n\n\u201cWe are done,\u201d I said, and the word done was mud. \u201cThe binding is set. It will run if\u2014it will run.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look ill,\u201d the Countess said, and she was right. I had sweated through my shirt and the air in the doorless room caught on me the way a skater\u2019s hand catches on a crack in the ice. My ribs hurt. I should not have ribs. It is a nonsense thought we all have the first time something important breaks.\n\n\u201cEscort him home,\u201d Mire called from beyond the threshold in the voice of someone who has been told about results and does not want to be told about procedure. \u201cWatch him breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can walk,\u201d I said.\n\nSevrin didn\u2019t contradict me. He simply arranged his arm so that I could find it if I forgot how to keep my feet going the same way as each other.\n\nOutside, the bell had stopped. The city hummed like a mouthful of bees. Fog crawled through the alleys very politely. We were mid-block on Varick, just to the left of the old Leviathan bridge, when Sevrin said, without turning his head, \u201cThen what now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d I said. My voice sounded like a voice thrown into a well that did not return it as kindly as one would hope. \u201cNow I sleep awhile. Then I go and I watch a speech. Then I find an alley that was not on any of your maps.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not try,\u201d he said. It was almost a plea. \u201cI have seen you in courtrooms. You think you can lawyer the universe. But there are some words that cannot be persuaded not to mean what they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just taught me that if I do not try I will not be able to sleep, ever,\u201d I said. \u201cLet me have at least the possibility of failure. You owe me that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI owe you nothing,\u201d he said, and then he sighed. \u201cI owe her, perhaps. For the plums.\u201d\n\nI stopped at the door to my rooms. It\u2019s ordinary, for someone who has made the inside of the world his workplace, to keep the outside plain. A set of three pegs for three coats, though I only ever wore one. A plant with leaves that have learned to shine by rubbing themselves against the window because we do not have enough light. Books carved into the wall. A kettle that takes forever.\n\nWithin, I took off the shirt that clung and threw it into a corner. In the mirror I did not look at myself because I can only ever do that on purpose. The left arm had a thread of red down to the wrist in imitation of blood. The word imitation made me smile and then not smile. The phial on my table had left a ring of something that was not condensation. My mouth tasted like rust.\n\nI took out the hidden things. A small tin filled with nails half polished, half still wearing their ship-rot. A deck of cards with three kings missing and the king of hearts replaced with a bad pen drawing of a crow. A coin that had no country. I have learned to trust objects that forget their inscriptions. I took out, lastly, the small piece of mirror I had cut from the big one to see if the small one would tell me kinder stories.\n\nI set the shard on edge and I said my true name. Not the one they used. The one that isn\u2019t in any of their files because I never wrote it down. My mouth opened and closed on it. It did not like to be said. There is a fine line between a spell and a confession.\n\nSomething woke behind my ribs. It liked being woken. It liked the math of light bouncing back in clean angles. It liked the idea of a world that could be resolved into integers. I took the needle from the drawer and I pricked my finger. Red gathered and was very shy about leaving home. It did though, finally. It hesitated like a friend in a doorway and then joined the air.\n\nIt is a small trick to count breaths and trick your body into thinking you are asleep when you are not. Wizards learn it early. Men who have lost their children learn it in a different way. I did both.\n\nI saw her, the first time, beneath the old train bridge where the weeds were metal. She walked like a person at home in ruins. Some people make ruins feel they have failed to frighten. She was talking to someone whose name I did not catch because of the whine of a defective streetlamp. I leaned on a railing and rehearsed the words I would never say. I do not forgive myself for this. There are things I have done that can be sorted into keep and burn and things that have to be filed under are you still a good person. This is in that last category.\n\nAt dawn\u2014I use the word because it is shorter than the truth\u2014we rose with the city. Everyone pretends they do not wake at the same time but we do. Kettles cry, boots find feet, arms reach for sleeves with the tiny fury of trying to convince cloth to be a second skin. The streets filled with a slow-moving density, no one sure whether this would be a day for errands or a day for scenes. The amphitheater by the river had been built from the skeleton of a collapsed library. People liked to say they could still hear pages turning when they sat there. They could not.\n\nGeneral Vale had the look of a man who had decided there were worse things than looking tired in public. His hair had been shaved close for convenience, not for effect. His suit fit well but not too well. He stood with his weight equally carried by both legs. People notice these things. They trust a man whose shoes match his gait.\n\nKaia stood behind him, on a platform cobbled together from door frames and stubbornness. She wore her work. Her hands were stamped black with oil the way some women used to darken their eyelashes to make them speak. She poured herself into a panel of switches like a prayer. She looked, briefly, toward the left side of the amphitheater where the old statue of a horse\u2019s head had lost its ears. She always checked landmarks as if they were old friends who could wander off. Her hair had been pulled back with a strip of red cloth that might once have been a uniform. She had not painted her nails this time.\n\nI stood among the crowd and shaped my body to be a person you brush past and forget. I was very good at this. It is useful to be ordinary if you want to commit extraordinary acts without interruption.\n\n\u201cCitizens,\u201d said Vale. He did not have to say citizens but he did and something in the crowd softened. People like the better versions of themselves even when they are called by names they are not allowed to own. \u201cWe were told we could share this city if we learned to be quiet. We were told to make ourselves easy to live with. We did. We have done very well at being easy. And yet we are asked for more. For the smoothness of our necks, for the slow narrowing of our bloodlines, for the patient surrender of our books and our songs and our right to weep. We have been gentle because we were told gentleness is survival.\u201d\n\nHe paused. It takes skill to pause without losing the rope you are climbing. He had that skill. Kaia leaned her shoulder against the panel briefly and looked up at something we could not see. She would never admit to prayer. That did not mean she did not do it.\n\n\u201cWe have been taught to fear the names of the people who feed on us,\u201d Vale continued, each word notched\u2014measureless. \u201cBut I am too old now to be afraid of a name, and I am old enough to remember a different way of speaking. They are not lords. They are not masters. They are not what they pretend.\u201d\n\nSomewhere in the crowd a woman sobbed once and stopped. It sounded like a cork finding a bottle.\n\n\u201cI am not asking you to burn,\u201d Vale said. \u201cI am asking you to step into the light you own.\u201d\n\nThe geas on my bones looked up sharply as if someone had called its name. It twitched inside me like a fish remembering an old river. It had three moments in which it could open and it preferred the second. I had built it that way. The opening would be a breath, a pause\u2014like the one Vale had just taken\u2014and then he would feel a sudden careful emptiness in his chest as if an organ had excused itself for a moment. He would look for a step and find none. He would sag, and the city would say the word: martyr. We had arranged it to look like an act of faith. Very tidy. Very us.\n\nI had also, in the dark while talking to someone who was no longer there, stitched in my map. And there it was\u2014the alley where the geas preferred to go if someone named it. You can hide a city within a sentence if you fold it right. I said the alley\u2019s name in a voice no one hears unless they were born underwater, and for a single precise instant the geas hesitated. I put a wedge in. It splintered. The sound was only audible to the part of me that never bleeds and never laughs. It was enough.\n\nKaia flinched. It could have been a gust. She looked toward the old horse\u2019s head again and then past it, past the river, past all of us, toward a place where the warehouses began to forget themselves. Her hand went to the red strip in her hair. She had been taught something by someone once: how to read the air. We never know which of our tricks will become our children\u2019s salvation. Or ours. She tugged the cloth once. It came free. A signal. I hope it was a signal. It felt like a signal.\n\nI stepped backward until my back found brick. I whispered into it. The brick whispered back. There is a lineage of alchemy that believes everything in the world agrees with everything else. People always meant it poetically. They had not made enough mistakes to see that sometimes the truth is unbearably literal. The brick and I made a deal. It would tell me when the geas moved in the mortar. I would not ask it to be anything other than brick. You should not ask a body to be more than it is when you are about to ask it to bear weight.\n\nVale\u2019s next word did not get said. In that, at least, I failed. He drew breath for it and the phrase shaped itself in the pad of his tongue and then stayed there, a cat refusing the door. He swayed. People thought it was passion. Some of them grabbed the stranger next to them, as people do when words tell them to. We are born with hands for a reason.\n\nKaia\u2019s fingers froze a centimeter over a switch. She had seen something no one else saw. She did not look at Vale. She looked at me.\n\nYou can combine familiarity with a face and the ache of other things and be wrong. But the eye knows. It is older than we are. She saw. I hid. I was the man behind the pillar by the vendor of burnt sugar nuts. I was ordinary. I was not in any of her stories and she recognized me anyway. Maybe not the name. Maybe just the outline under the skin.\n\nShe mouthed a word I could not read and then, very simply, she stepped off the platform.\n\nNot the long drop. She chose the short ladder. She chose the ground. People objected. She moved like water through a net.\n\nI followed the alley I had drawn and it let me in. It was a real alley when I had started, but the geas had invited it into a different kind of existence. The mortar tasted of iron, the way only an old city tastes. The brick told me where the binding had been anchored. It lay under the third step of the amplifier array. I had expected that. It wasn\u2019t what mattered.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Kaia said from behind me, and there she was. No oil now on her hands. She had wiped them on the red strip and the red strip hung from her fingers like a flag that did not want to be this kind of flag.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t?\u201d I said softly. \u201cI am making a career out of not-don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been dead for years,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always made your living while dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have breathed every day,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cAir doesn\u2019t mean alive,\u201d she said and tossed the red cloth to the ground. Her eyes were a brown that had been dipped in honey and coffee and left on a windowsill. \u201cThey sent you. The night. Of course they did. And you came because you always come when they whistle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came because they would have done it without me,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I am better at the crooked straight line.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou came because you want to pretend there\u2019s a rule about this that the right loophole will undo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou came because you think you can make the machinery of the world miscount. Which: yes. You can. I\u2019ve seen your prints on things you never touched. You came because\u2014\u201d\n\nShe stopped. She had looked at my hands.\n\n\u201cKade,\u201d she said, tasting the name with spite and something else. \u201cYour hands are too clean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not touch the phial,\u201d I said. \u201cMy friend held it. Does it matter where the stain is when the stain is everywhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I meant.\u201d She came closer rather than farther. She reached out and put her fingers very lightly on my wrist and the whole city fell quiet because of it. An absurd thought, but my brain will use any excuse to explain a big sensation. \u201cYou\u2019re too cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city is cold,\u201d I said, remembering Sevrin\u2019s line and hating it because today we were all quoting each other like a chorus.\n\nShe pressed inside my wrist with her thumb where the skin is thin and the story of the body normally tells itself. She did not find what she expected. Her eyes widened not with fear. With recognition. Some of us, when we repair old radios, learn the language of currents and contacts. We can tell the difference between a loop of living bioelectric nonsense and a hum that has been designed to forget itself.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOf course they would. Of course you would.\u201d She breathed once. \u201cWho made you? Who did I bury?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother did not bury me,\u201d I said, and my voice belonged to a different room, a different city. A different man. \u201cWe left before you were old enough to count in years. It is\u2026 complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything you say arrives with a fog machine and a stagehand,\u201d she said flatly. She did not move her thumb. She kept it on the mute place where, if I had been insisting on being the sort of creature I told everyone I was, there would have been a flutter telling her my heart had ideas. Ideas do not vibrate. They do not warm a wrist. \u201cAre you even my father?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d And after the rage had shouted its first syllable: \u201cHow.\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes. It was not brave. It was the only way I could keep my voice level. \u201cI know how to write a DNA poem,\u201d I said, because jokes sometimes keep terror from eating your feet. \u201cI am not metal all the way to the edges. I am a complicated object\u2014Kaia. They made me to make things. To stitch. To keep count. To be steady when other people shake. I did not know it at the beginning. They told me when it was useful. They forgot that things they make remember themselves.\u201d\n\nShe pulled her hand away. \u201cSo you can\u2019t even die properly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI die like anyone else if you take enough pieces,\u201d I said. \u201cI am not here to argue with you about God. I am here to take the geas and reshape it so it eats me instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t how\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not the only one who can make a dead radio speak,\u201d I said. \u201cWe all have languages. Mine is older than electricity and makes better jokes. I built a bend into it. If I step into that bend, it will snap in my direction. Vale will live to say his last line. You will stand on your platform and pretend to be angry at him about the volume until the people laugh with you. I will fall down like a man poisoned by his own spine. They will call it guilt or justice or an accident. Then I would like you to take the red cloth and leave before my friend has time to realize what alley I used.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. The rage came back and it had company. \u201cNo. You do not get to climb on a pyre and call it parenting. You do not get to be heroic in the middle and absent at the ends. You do not get to choose a death that lets you be decent in a story you wrote.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not decent,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I did not write this story. I am just the page they printed on because it was convenient.\u201d\n\nHer laugh was a paper cut. \u201cYou taught me everything I know about machining because I watched you, through windows you thought were fogged. You make the world with your hands and then you look down when it starts moving and declare it god. You are an engine pretending to be a book.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is good,\u201d I said, unable not to admire it. \u201cSay it at a crowd someday. They will like it. Do not say it to Vale. He reads too slowly.\u201d\n\nShe stepped back and looked at me as if I were a building she had to decide whether to trust. Then, with the economy characteristic of her best work, she said two sentences and saved time.\n\n\u201cIf you do this, I will never forgive you. If you don\u2019t, I will never forgive you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is fortunate,\u201d I said, \u201cthat your forgiveness has never been a condition of my love.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove,\u201d she said as if tasting an old sweet that had melted in the wrapper. \u201cYou\u2019re a machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you were an infant,\u201d I said, because I found myself unwilling to be ashamed of everything today. \u201cWe are all limited in our first forms.\u201d\n\nShe put the red cloth in my hand. It felt like a signal again, but a different one.\n\n\u201cThen let\u2019s rig it,\u201d she said curtly. \u201cShow me your alley. If I am going to be dragged into a myth I want to fix the props.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are late,\u201d she said, and she was right. The geas, like all programs with pride, used any pause to assert itself. I could feel it skating along bone, looking for the place my map was weakest.\n\nWe settled into the place by the third step where the binding had been taught to sleep. Kaia knelt and unscrewed a plate with a bit she pulled from behind her ear. She handed me two lengths of wire and did not explain what color was what; she knew I knew. The two of us crouched like thieves in a chapel, touching the world in the way only people who listen do. The air inside the machine tasted like a coin.\n\n\u201cOn three,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOn two,\u201d she said, and we did both. I have never felt more accurately understood.\n\nVale\u2019s word finally slid off his tongue and landed where it was supposed to. People caught it like a thrown ball. He took a breath and another. The geas opened its mouth. I stepped into it.\n\nIt is not easy to describe what it feels like to trick a spell into eating you. It is like convincing your own reflection to reach out and pick your pocket. It is like asking your bones to shift a little aside so you can be a different shape while remaining the same shape. It is like removing a wedding ring so that you can take off a glove. It is like\u2014it is like. It is like.\n\nI felt the bite. It was not dramatic. It was clean. A shut door. That is what death is most days. A shut door and the picture falling off the wall because of the draft.\n\nKaia caught my shoulder. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, reflexively, as people do when a glass falls. And then louder, with intent: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nShe had her mouth near my ear now and I remembered the first time she had spoken into my hair to tell me a secret that had no words. She was not tall. I am. These things matter when the body is failing politely.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t build it right,\u201d she said, and there was more pride than fear in her voice. \u201cYou refused to assume you would survive. You gave it no path for afterwards. That is sloppy.\u201d She traced something fast on my skin. It burned in a pattern that I recognized much later. She pressed. She turned. She forced the geas to stutter. She spoke its name with her hands. She bled onto it without cutting herself because that is something I taught her with spoons and screws and the long thin shards of a radio\u2019s spine.\n\n\u201cTake it,\u201d she said. \u201cTake it and lay it across your back like a plank. Be a bridge. Don\u2019t be a hole.\u201d\n\nThe oldest software in me\u2014sorry, the oldest magic\u2014rippled gratefully. You can always wake ancient things by speaking to them in brazen baby talk. It listened to Kaia because she spoke to it like a colleague. It shifted. It stopped eating my heart, which is not a heart but enough. It moved lower, it settled in the place where I have always known how to carry burdens. It hurt. It kept hurting. It would keep on hurting as long as I let it, as long as Vale drew breaths and used them for words. The bite had become a weight. We could work with weight.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll still die,\u201d I said through a throat that did not want me to.\n\n\u201cEveryone does,\u201d she said in an absurdly cheerful voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t get extra points for doing it onstage. Now, go. Get to the place where the Bridge That Isn\u2019t shows its hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I am found,\u201d I said, \u201cthey will hurt you to teach me not to be found.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always hurt someone,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think I have not been living here too? Go.\u201d\n\nI went. I tucked the red strip of cloth into my collar because I wanted it to smell like smoke and her hair. The alley widened and became a street like any other. Vale had resumed speaking into the sky as if speaking were a way to do things and not just the thing itself. People lifted their faces so his words could fall on them and wash their eyes.\n\nOn the way to the Bridge That Isn\u2019t there is a door with a sign that says Always Closed. It is always closed. Behind it is a stair that goes down into a room that is sometimes a kitchen and sometimes a sea cave and sometimes a train platform at three in the morning when the lights work. I used to sit there with Sevrin and think we were the only ones who knew where the door went. I used to be that kind of stupid.\n\nAt the bottom of the stair now there was a person. She leaned against the pillar with a look that suggested pillars should be grateful. The person could have been the Countess if she were bad at makeup and good at not caring. She could have been someone else entirely. She smiled without teeth and held out both hands like a rabbi and an assassin.\n\n\u201cKade,\u201d she said. \u201cYou did not come to see me when you arrived in the city. I am taking it personally.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone tells me I have been doing this wrong,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou write the law,\u201d she replied, \u201cand you pretend to follow it. You come to me when you need a change of costume.\u201d\n\nI knew her name in three different languages and none matter. The underground calls her Ash. The Registry calls her Laurel. The children in the yards call her Auntie Knife and ask her to tell the story about the bear who moved into the courthouse and made the judges carry honey for him in their hats. She uses all of her names and none.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I said. The weight on my back pulsed. It had learned to measure its own movement and was not delighted by the results. \u201cI need to walk under a different sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone does,\u201d she said. \u201cShow me the bruise.\u201d\n\nI showed it. She put her ear to my chest and listened and her mouth twisted when she did not hear what she expected. \u201cWell, well. That answers a bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not have time\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDearest,\u201d she said, and somehow the word was not condescension, \u201ctime is all we have. Even if there is none. You taught me that. Sit.\u201d\n\nI sat. She ran her fingers along the seams of my ribs and looked very, very thoughtful. She hummed. She bit the inside of her cheek. She muttered in a language that had fewer vowels than ours. \u201cI can take it off you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it will take the rest with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need the rest to stand,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen I can move it,\u201d she said. \u201cI can put it somewhere no one thinks to look. It will still hurt. It will confuse the people who planted it there, which is my favorite thing. It will give you\u2014\u201d She tilted her head. \u201c\u2014two hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen you fall down,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you may choose when.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d I said.\n\nShe braided my breath. That is the simplest way to tell it. She took handfuls of the air inside me and wove them together with something older and thinner and stronger than hair. She pulled. She shoved. She used the heels of her hands to push the weight where it did not want to go. She sang a bad little song about a woman trying to get a mattress up a narrow stair and I wanted to laugh and couldn\u2019t because my chest was not my own. And then it was over and I could stand again, although my legs had opinions about it.\n\n\u201cRun along,\u201d she said, and slapped my shoulder like an aunt. \u201cTell your honorable man he owes me a favor. Tell your daughter to stop using red ties, they make her too obvious. Tell the Night that when they come to collect they should bring better bags.\u201d\n\nI put my hand on her arm and said the thank you a person says to someone who has just convinced them not to die quite yet and she shrugged it off and pretended to fix my collar instead. That is the living for you.\n\nBack into the lightless light. The river had begun to practice being a mirror. The amphitheater was five minutes away if you had your breath and more if you did not. I moved through the crowd like water through metal. People make way for a man with a certain sort of face and it is not fair but today it was helpful. I think it is something about guilt\u2014it smells like rain to some noses.\n\nOnstage, Vale lifted his hand in a gesture that was going to find its way onto etchings and the inside of cheap rings if we did not stop it. Kaia had resumed her place. She did not look at me. She looked at the city, which is better.\n\n\u201cAnd so,\u201d Vale said, and the geas on my back sank little teeth in and I did not fall because the braid held, \u201cwe can begin to be difficult. We can begin to ask for receipts, as the old aunties say. We can begin to refuse to wear costumes that make us kind to monsters.\u201d\n\nThe laughter that rose was unplanned and therefore sacred. People recognized themselves in it. It had the sound of so many pots laid down at last.\n\nThe Night would come for this. They would come quietly and prettily and write checks the size of buildings. They would hire language to do their lifting. They would offer rueful grins to the cameras. They would arrest no one we noticed and everyone we did not. They would make parents teach children how to shut up without saying it.\n\nThey would also come for me.\n\n\u201cSevrin!\u201d I shouted into a future that was about to become present. I do not know why I called him. I do. Of course I do. I wanted a friend. Or I wanted to remind myself I had once had one.\n\nWhen the Night\u2019s agents moved, they moved like ink looking for an edge to ruin. I felt them before I saw them. There is an old part of me that detects pressure changes in rooms and pressure changes in plans. They came. They did not wear uniforms. They wore the air. The braid at my back murmured that time was shorter than we wanted to believe. Kaia lifted her chin and her mouth found a shape I had seen once when she was twelve and the woman at the bread stall had told her she could not have the stale loaf because the rules were for everyone. The shape meant: Try me.\n\nI had set a geas and stepped into it. I had redrawn a map and walked it. I had handed a piece of my breath to a woman who kept knives in her laugh. I had hurt someone I loved and made it useful. I had told the truth badly. There is only so much one man can do before the bell rings again.\n\nIt rang. But not the bell I expected. This one was a bicycle bell, tinny and brave. It came from the top of the amphitheater where a boy of nine sat on the saddle of a contraption he had probably not built himself and rang and rang and rang because someone had told him ringing bells brings luck and he had decided to believe it. It saved no one and saved everyone.\n\nVale finished his sentence. The crowd did not break. The Night\u2019s ink found too many edges. The amphitheater held.\n\nWhen Sevrin arrived he was breathless, which told me nothing useful except that he had chosen to run rather than to glide. He found me because he always does. He put his hand on my arm and he did not say anything and then he did.\n\n\u201cYou cannot keep doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot write your way out of every wall we build.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should build better walls,\u201d I said, and spared him a smile he had known when we still believed in different kinds of time.\n\nHis eyes slid to my collarbone. The red strip of cloth lay there like a notary\u2019s stamp. He looked past me and saw Kaia and something cracked in his face and it did not put itself back. \u201cShe found you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe did,\u201d I said. \u201cYou cannot stop people from finding what you leave in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never tried,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was your hobby.\u201d\n\nHe looked older and then he looked at the clock with no hands and then he said, very quietly, \u201cWe are out of grace. I cannot protect you from this. I can only make a shape around it so that it looks nicer as it ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake me a cup,\u201d I said. \u201cI am thirsty.\u201d\n\nHe did not laugh. He had stopped laughing. He lifted a hand, very small, and the Night around us arranged their faces. He could not unring bells. He could not unname a geas. He could not do much more than stand with me while I paid for the alley. Sometimes that is all friendship gets to be.\n\n\u201cTwo hours,\u201d Ash had said. Already the braid was fraying where I carried it. Vale\u2019s last words were finding him. The city had begun to sharpen its teeth on hope. The Night had bared their own. Between them there is a line you cannot see until it is too late to step over. I had stepped over. Kaia had jumped. Sevrin had been placed.\n\nI reached for my daughter with my eyes and she met them because now she could and there was not time for more than the shape of a nod. The red cloth warmed on my skin as if it were alive. The Night opened their mouths and showed me the absence inside. My back bent under the bite that was a weight now, only a weight, only a bridge.\n\nThey do not like bridges. Vampires prefer tunnels. It is harder to own what lets other people cross.\n\n\u201cDo you have any last requests?\u201d Sevrin asked, which was not a joke and not exactly not one.\n\n\u201cBring plums to the children,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd teach them to spit the pits at your door.\u201d\n\nHe bowed, and for a moment he, too, looked like a man and not a rule.\n\nSomewhere inside my chest a small very old machine ticked once\u2014just once\u2014and then went still, as if it wanted to be sure I noticed it noticing me. It is a strange thing to know you are constructed and know you can still be ruined. It is stranger to realize both truths make you alive.\n\nThe bell began to ring again. Or perhaps it was only in my head. It did not matter. I lifted my hands. I was ready to be very difficult indeed.Difficult begins with a breath you refuse to spend the way they want. I took mine, counted it twice because the braid at my back liked it better that way, and raised my voice like a flag you can\u2019t legally forbid. There are clauses written for the days the city remembers itself. We tucked them under satin words in volumes no one checks because governments do not expect the living to memorize footnotes. I had written that footnote eighteen years ago as a joke with iron filings in it. If a bell rings in the presence of a public declaration and there are more than five witnesses and the Clock that has no hands can see the speaker\u2019s mouth, the Night must accept the Open Forum and halt overt enforcement for thirteen minutes and thirteen heartbeats. The bell had rung. The declaration had declared. The witnesses spilled over the seats like water over a lip. And even a clock without hands can stare.\n\n\u201cOpen Forum,\u201d I said, and I did not shout. Good law does not need volume; it needs naming. \u201cUnder the Truces of Long Dusk, Section Six, Article Nocturne, governing Assemblies of Concern. I cite the bell and the mouths and the empty face that remembers time. I name Archon Mire. I name the Countess of Sugared Bones. I name Sevrin, who knows the pages by taste. I name the Night Registry as a body. You will stand down for the duration.\u201d\n\nSevrin\u2019s head turned halfway, like a man listening for his own footstep on a stair. The agents who wore the air paused, which is as much as you can expect when you\u2019re binding the people who think binding is something that happens to other animals. People around me did not know they had heard a law until the pause arrived and set itself at their feet like a cat waiting to be admired from a respectful distance. Mire\u2019s voice came from nowhere and everywhere in the way power prefers; it scraped, very faintly, on the inside of my teeth.\n\n\u201cThirteen minutes,\u201d he said, because he kept his own copy of the Truces and had underlined the parts that made him nervous. \u201cAnd thirteen heartbeats. Do not pretend you will keep them tidy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the point,\u201d I said. \u201cTidiness is your hobby. Mine is the law.\u201d\n\nThe amphitheater exhaled as if it had been holding a breath none of us could afford. Vale did not squander it. He looked up as if receiving instruction from a bird and then did the simplest thing: he thanked the bell. That is a very old trick. Thank something that made a good noise at the right time. It makes the rest of the noises want to behave.\n\nKaia had the panel under her hands and the panel understood it was being handled by someone for whom the world was not a puzzle but a workshop. She did not look at me again. She used the thirteen minutes like a woman can use the last of the butter before payday to make a pan taste like childhood. She poured Vale into the city in a way microphones were not supposed to do. She lifted a frequency just a fraction, the way you lift a child to see over the rail, and the words traveled better. We have always been a city of carries\u2014bridges between the places someone tried to sever. I felt the weight on my back negotiate with the new current. It decided, temporarily, that being a bridge could be a vocation rather than a punishment.\n\n\u201cSay the vow,\u201d I called, not to Vale, but to the doctrine. \u201cPut what you are doing somewhere even they agree not to step on.\u201d\n\nVale met my eye for the first time. He saw a man carrying something and did not ask if he could help because he was busy and because he is not a liar. He nodded in that short military way and lifted his right hand and then he used words that had been written when the city still believed daylight was a right. He vowed that any act taken against people gathered in intended peace within sight of the Observatory and the Clock would be answered not with knives but with names repeated daily until names wore a path in stone. It was a vow designed by monks who understood bureaucracy. If you want to make vampires uncomfortable, make them imagine the length of a list they do not control.\n\nSevrin\u2019s mouth twisted. I had known him long enough to see the exact beat where he weighed the worth of interrupting a vow versus the cost of being witnessed interrupting it. He let it stand because letting it stand permitted elegance later, and he is a collector of elegant later. The Countess, wherever she was smiling without her teeth, would have approved. If you are going to fall, you might as well make a shape of it the children can trace on their desks.\n\nThe thirteen minutes did not hoard themselves. They ran. I have never loved time more than when it shows you how ordinary running looks when it wears a cloak and pretends to be dignified. Vale went through his points, and they were points you could have guessed: tithes, blood-rights, lineages clipping themselves obediently, the soft murder of songs, the price of being polite. Nothing there is news unless news has always meant a rope you hand to the next climber. He did the clever thing at the end of the thirteen that was his and thirteen heartbeats that were not: he stopped where you expect a crescendo. He left the note in his throat. He let the crowd sing it with their mouths closed.\n\nThen the ink moved again. They could not help it. Polite predators still have to taste. The air\u2019s pressure changed. Kaia flicked a switch with her knuckle because she does not believe in letting electricity be lonely. I shifted my feet so my spine could carry better. If a bridge creaks, that\u2019s honesty, not failure.\n\n\u201cParole,\u201d I said to Sevrin, who had come to stand close enough that our shoulders could have remembered chess if they had been those kinds of shoulders. \u201cYou will give him parole to leave this place with his skin unpunctured. You will give her\u201d\u2014and here I tilted my head toward Kaia with the same small movement Sevrin had used moments before\u2014\u201csafe conduct under veil and public witness to a place I will name. You will tie the two to the same paper so you cannot forget one and remember the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder what authority,\u201d he said very gently, because he always taught me with pokes, \u201cdo you request this paper in the middle of a theater while a man purports to be sunlight?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the same that gives you the right to demand my breath,\u201d I said. \u201cUnder the oath I took and the oath you hold over me and the clause about acts taken in the open becoming part of the Archive. If you do not write the parole I demand, I will write an intercalation into the Clock and the next time you blink the city will insert a day between this dusk and the next and you will have to explain to your elders why everyone suddenly remembers morning.\u201d\n\nHe did not laugh. You do not laugh when someone mentions intercalation unless you are a historian or a murderer. He looked at the blank face above the stage, and I saw his pupils tighten as if the present had moved closer to his eye without asking permission.\n\n\u201cYou cannot,\u201d he said, for form, and not because he believed it.\n\n\u201cI stitched the handless place in the face,\u201d I said. \u201cI left myself a pocket. I lined it with a rule. Don\u2019t insult me and pretend I\u2019m threatening you with clouds.\u201d\n\nHe considered how much of this conversation would be recorded and how much would be rumor and which would damage him more. Being a vampire is largely a matter of curating your reflection in conversations you do not attend. He lifted two fingers and the air wearing agents softened around the edges the way people do when they are told to smile before a camera. It was not a retreat. It was a costume change.\n\n\u201cParole,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder notice of forum, under oath of witness, under the eye of an object pretending not to be a clock. Where is your place?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bridge That Isn\u2019t,\u201d I said, and he had to close his eyes to hide the flicker because he knew it, and because in our line of work the real injury is admitting knowledge at the wrong time. \u201cLeave Vale at the Leviathan\u2019s foot. Leave Kaia at the stairs that are always closed. Do not follow her, do not watch her, do not send the air to learn about her. Count to two thousand with your mouth shut and an orange in your teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a ridiculous man,\u201d he said, but his mouth softened the way mouths do when pain arrives in a polite suit. \u201cAnd if I obey you, you will call it friendship.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you obey me, I will call it law,\u201d I said. \u201cI have called other things friendship and regretted it less.\u201d\n\nWe made the bargain. It is how this city remains the shape it is. We take our knives and we lay them briefly beside each other and pretend this is a meal. The parole was not a document yet, but the Archive had already started to copy our mouths. When enough people decide to remember something the Night can only burn so many notebooks.\n\nKaia moved first. She did not look like someone being given safe conduct. She looked offended at the idea that she had ever needed it. She came down from the platform as if it were a chair she was finished with. She put her hand, lightly and unceremoniously, on Vale\u2019s sleeve. She leaned in as if to tell him to speak louder and then I saw her lips move and even without a microphone I could see the shape of the syllables: stay in the middle. Do not let them peel you. He nodded. He is stupid about many domestic things, it turns out, but not about taking instruction regarding his skin.\n\nI turned and took two steps because my job here was done and because the weight at my back had begun to count to thirteen while pretending it wasn\u2019t counting. The braid would hold, Ash had promised, but I could feel the fibers thinking about regrets. Sevrin matched me. He did not put his hand on me. He carried his own body like a man in a painting that expects an arrow.\n\n\u201cYou will come to the Apse,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will not make me spend my little stock of mercy on chasing you into a sewer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could spend it on plums,\u201d I said. \u201cThe children are unimpressed by your Latin.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be cruel,\u201d he said, and in that moment he was not the Night but a tired thing wearing fancy teeth. \u201cYou know what it costs me to walk away from a door I could lock.\u201d\n\nI stopped because I am not cruel when it hurts the wrong person. \u201cI will come,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I will stop in two places first.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not have that much blood to play with,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWho said anything about mine,\u201d I said, and that was a cheap shot because I could see him calculating, instantly, the other bodies I could be about to spend. \u201cI will go to the Bridge and I will go to the door that is Always Closed and then I will give you the remainder of what the braid leaves me.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery dramatically,\u201d he said. \u201cGods forgive you your taste.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am new at this,\u201d I lied, and he let me because we both needed to pretend some skills arrive late.\n\nUnder the Leviathan the parole dissolved into the old river air and the carved feet of a creature that never had a body to carry it. Vale went one way escorted by citizens who had decided their bodies counted as laws today. Kaia vanished down the stair that tells everyone to mind its manners. The Night watched the place where she had been as if watching could make a pattern they\u2019d recognize the next time. I planted myself in the flow and let the city bump me until the current decided to push me toward Ash, and then it was as if the cobbles had been greased with something that doesn\u2019t stain.\n\nThe room behind Always Closed was not any of its three default moods. It had had an evening since I left and evenings are heavy. It had decided to be a kitchen where the kettle whistle is two notes flat and a small sharp dog sleeps beside the cold stove and the wallpaper believes in flowers. Ash was not behind the pillar. She was at the table counting matches with a care that made me suspect each match had a childhood. She did not look up. She knew the weight in the doorway. You do not study a door for twenty years without learning to tell who uses it by inclination.\n\n\u201cYou have thirteen grains of rice in your pocket and three lies under your tongue,\u201d she said, and lifted the lid of the sugar tin to check it was still sugar and not something that wanted to be. \u201cI will take the lies for later. Spit them in my hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need your poverty,\u201d I said. \u201cI need your doors that open only for women who knit and men who don\u2019t apologize. I need your children who can hold breath longer than the river. The Night will try to come through the little holes while everyone looks at the big mouth. I need them stopped with string and laughter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need the city to defend itself,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine. We\u2019ve been practicing.\u201d\n\nShe did not scold me for asking. She never scolds people doing late good. She opened the tin where she keeps old train tickets that she pretends are lucky because luck is a language and not a fact. She handed me three blue ones with corners gone to tooth. \u201cShow these to anyone who asks for a password,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly fools ask for passwords. My children prefer souvenirs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSevrin wants me at the Apse,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOf course he does,\u201d she said without rancor. \u201cHe wants to hold your hand while they feed you to the mouth he works for and tell himself he has at last done you the favor of neatness. Do you want me to call him Uncle while you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to tell him the bear has moved,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd that honey is not a metaphor.\u201d\n\nShe squinted as if turning that around in the back of her head. \u201cYou are taking the oath out of the oath-room,\u201d she said, and if I had been a person who believed in signs I would have believed in that one because her face did something very small and very old when she said it. \u201cYou are going to the Archive. Alone, because you think that makes you more noble and more precise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going alone because if I take anyone I love, the Night will put them on a scale and make me choose between weight and shape,\u201d I said. \u201cI have handled enough scales for a lifetime.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoward,\u201d she said, and this was not an insult. It is a mercy to be named. \u201cTake the dog. He bites without caring about pedigrees.\u201d\n\nThe dog opened one eye and judged me suitable for biting. I declined him politely. \u201cIf I come back this way\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you do, bring me a piece of the handless clock. I like useless faces.\u201d\n\nI put one of the blue tickets on the table beside her matches. It wasn\u2019t a payment. It was a promise to remember a trick she had taught me when my hands were still trying to decide whether they belonged to a person or a plan. She flicked it with one nail and made it sing a little and that was a benediction.\n\nUpstairs the city had not transformed. It had clarified. Sometimes you change the world not by painting it a new color but by reminding people they can see. The Night had receded the way the tide does when it remembers there are other bays and other boats. The braid made teeth again and I answered it with arithmetic. Each step to the Apse took a year you could fold into an envelope if you had the right glue. Sevrin would have had people watching for me to go left. I went left. It is very satisfying, sometimes, to obey the enemy where they cannot stand being obeyed.\n\nThe Clock had, for most of my adult life, refused time. That is a kind of politics. Today it refused me first and then, grudgingly, accepted my weight the way an old horse accepts a rider who still remembers how to sit. The Apse was mostly empty because vampires don\u2019t need rooms for ceremony when the city is doing its own spectacle. Mire waited like a blot that had never wanted to pretend to be ink. The Countess perched with the grace of a girl in a dress she had practiced in front of mirrors until mirrors adored her. Two junior nocturnals stood so still the dust liked their shoulders.\n\n\u201cMaster Kade,\u201d Mire said, as if I had arrived to replace a hinge. \u201cYou cost us today.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou paid,\u201d I said. \u201cYou hate it when the two match.\u201d\n\nThe Countess slid an eyebrow into a place where it could be admired and found wanting. \u201cYou thread loopholes into your own hangings,\u201d she said. \u201cQuite the seamstress.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d I said. \u201cTalk plain. You intended to break a man in public and make the break sing like his fault. You used my daughter\u2019s throat to carry the tune. I picked up the note and put it somewhere safer. I will be given, in return, at least the courtesy of not being told it was a misunderstanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cCourtesy is for kings and children,\u201d Mire said. \u201cWe employ neither.\u201d\n\nSevrin entered behind me and the room changed the way a weather vane changes its mind when the wind remembers a story from its childhood. He smelled like the river and like furniture polish and like worry. He took his place at Mire\u2019s right hand with the neatness of habit. I was determined not to see how relieved I was to have his spine in the room to press words against.\n\n\u201cYou want to unmake your oath,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not waste our time arranging cushions around the furniture. Say the thing you came to say badly. We will clean it up and make it fit on a shelf.\u201d\n\nI thought of Ash\u2019s kitchen where the matches were saints and the kettle held songs for better days. I thought of my daughter\u2019s fingers on my wrist, not feeling the story she expected to find. I thought of the city counting itself, finally. I did not bother with pretty.\n\n\u201cI rescind consent,\u201d I said. \u201cI withdraw from the Oath of Necessary Instruments. Under clause of self-recusal for contamination of anchor. Under clause of irreparable conflict. Under emergency provision of prior wrong. Under the doctrine of a wizard\u2019s right to die his own death.\u201d\n\nSilence arrived like a parent at the edge of a playground.\n\n\u201cThat doctrine was always a joke,\u201d the Countess said at last, with admiration because even vampires can love a well-placed jest. \u201cYou lay it in there on a dare and left it for the day you needed to say something that made the air blush.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a joke until it is not,\u201d I said. \u201cLike morning. Like justice. Like being friends with the man who signs your meals.\u201d\n\nMire\u2019s mouth did that thing it does when he is about to name what everyone else has been warmed up to avoid. \u201cYou cannot rescind,\u201d he said. \u201cOaths are not paper. They are glue.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou used my blood,\u201d I said. \u201cYou do not get to be shocked when it grows scabs. I renounce. I have the right by the very terms you prefer. The city heard me give that oath. The city will hear me take it back. If you insist on theater, you have to accept the script has other readers.\u201d\n\nSevrin shifted, not quite a step but the space between a breath and the next one. \u201cThere is a way,\u201d he said, low, and Mire turned his head as if to bite his ear for daring to contribute. \u201cDo not look at me as if you did not hire me to solve your continuity errors. The Archive will not allow an oath to be removed without its seat being filled. If Kade puts down the Necessary, someone must pick up the book it rested on. He has found someone to hold it while he runs.\u201d\n\nI did not let my face tell lies about surprise. \u201cDo not look at me as if you did not train me to see ladders in paintings,\u201d I said to him. \u201cI have someone to hold the book and it is not someone who will be gentle with the pages.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour daughter,\u201d the Countess said, and smiled because sometimes even clever children put their fingers on the hot pan and say ow in a way that amuses the aunt who warned them. \u201cHow circular. How Greek.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not your altar,\u201d I said, and it came out too fast, too sharp. The braid bit down and I bit back on the sound. \u201cAnd she does not hold your doctrine. She holds only a piece of me I am giving her because I owe her more than I have left. She will hold the weight, not the leash. I use your shapes, Archon, I do not feed you on my family\u2019s bone.\u201d\n\nMire considered whether to be offended. Offense is a tool. He is a man who counts his tools when he leaves a room. \u201cUnmake your oath, then,\u201d he said, at last. \u201cDo it here, under our eyes. And when you have unmade it, understand that what made you useful to us will be gone, and we will be free to treat you as a man who knows too much and belongs to no mechanism.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already treat me like that,\u201d I said, and stepped into the space in the floor that they use for weathers. Every room with a drain has a place where the air and the stone agree to speak if you insist. I took three breaths and they were not neat. I said my true name and it rolled out like a coin under a cabinet where you cannot retrieve it without lying on the dirty floor. I said the name they wrote in my file and it sat on my tongue like a spoon that had never stirred anything but broth. I said the name my daughter had not called me because fathers are a kind of language you learn from other mouths and she had no dictionaries left. The room did not like being confused. Good. I roped the confusion and tied it to the Archivum Root. Then I told the Oath it had a hole in it and I crawled out.\n\nI have rarely felt more ordinary. It feels like taking off a ring that has made your finger its permanent address. It feels like walking out of a house without your boots on. It feels like air having the audacity not to be cold solely for you. It hurt less than the braid. It hurt longer.\n\nThe Archive made a sound like a book closing in another city. The Countess flinched because vampires do not expect paper to make teeth. Mire did not move. He is very good at not moving. Sevrin reached for the back of a chair and found it and did not sit because that would look like relief and he does not perform that piece for anyone anymore.\n\n\u201cYou think you are free,\u201d Mire said. \u201cHow sweet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I am expensive,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you do not like the receipt.\u201d\n\nHe flicked his fingers and two of the air-wearers slid toward me as if they were on strings. They were going to take wrists, old joke, new method. Sevrin did not stop them because that is not the part he plays. The Countess did not stop them because she had to see how I moved without the Oath to guess if I had taken anything else on my way out the door. I lifted my arms because I had promised Sevrin cups and I prefer to keep my little promises in rooms where large ones bleed.\n\n\u201cOn your way,\u201d Mire said, with a sort of parson\u2019s charity. \u201cTo your Bridge. To your dog. To your daughter who makes her hair tell secrets. You have made a day\u2019s mess. We will find the broom that fits it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what you always forget,\u201d I said. \u201cThe broom is the thing that remembers where all the dirt is. It does not love the hand that holds it.\u201d\n\nI left with wrists politely encircled by men who think manners make manacles. Sevrin did not walk with me because that would be too much like sympathy, but he placed himself where my shoulder could see him. He is good at that also. The city stroked my face as if checking for fever. The braid tugged and I tugged back. We made a poor dog and a stubborn leash. I went to the Bridge.\n\nThe Bridge That Isn\u2019t gets its name from letting people go places without admitting to it. As a structure, it is the least interesting thing in the city. As a rumor, it could float a cathedral. Under it, people come to bargain with the water when the water refuses their coins. On top of it, children spit and count how long before the drops learn sky. Today it was a piece of concrete with history painted in dueling graffiti hands and a sense that if you squinted you could see twenty-seven versions of the same argument layered until only the verbs still glowed. Vale stood near the midpoint with men and women forming a circle around him like a new kind of weather. He was not hiding. He is uninterested in hiding. He understands tunnels, which is not the same thing.\n\nKaia had not come here. Good. She had elders who weren\u2019t me and doors that like her better than they like anyone living. The parole crackled like cellophane and I knew we had seconds instead of minutes. I moved to Vale and did not pretend I had arrived for a chat. His eyes flicked over me, counted damage, counted uses left, counted how many more syllables he could afford.\n\n\u201cYou bought me thirteen minutes,\u201d he said, gratitude short and tidy because that\u2019s the habit of his house. \u201cWhat do I owe you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou owe the children plums,\u201d I said, because learning to be in charge includes learning to deliver sweets on time. \u201cAnd you owe the city a promise you can keep. Not the big one. The small one. Promise not to disappear when this gets ugly. Promise to be difficult where everyone can see you. That is cheaper for the rest of us.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. His mouth considered a smile and vetoed it. He was about to speak when the braid bit so hard my vision folded into accordion. I put my palm on the cold-flat rail and told the weight a story about walking uphill with groceries and it consented to be a hill and not a cliff. Vale saw more than I wanted him to. He said the words for water someone taught sailors when prayers were still sensible. He is a man who knows how to have superstitions in public without apologizing. I liked him better for it.\n\n\u201cThey will come for your girl,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not have to be a vampire to know which lever pulls the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will come for your lovers,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd your cooks and the old woman who taught you to make a bed square enough to sleep in and the lieutenant who keeps you from saying the wrong word when you are tired. They will come for your barber and your cobbler and the boy who runs between you and the telephone because old habits make faster lines. Do not list them. If you list them they become a menu.\"\n\nHe met my eye and I think\u2014I think he chose not to ask. He is wise enough to understand that if you ask a man like me how many people he has already fed to this machine, the answer becomes a rope. Instead he put his palm over mine on the rail as if we were two men instructing a child in how to lean.\n\n\u201cTwo hours,\u201d I said. \u201cI used some.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll spend the rest,\u201d he said. \u201cI am good at budgets.\u201d\n\nWe were interrupted by the sound of a violin doing its best to be a siren. No one plays a violin like that unless there is a message jammed under the strings. I turned and saw a boy with hair like new bronze standing on one of the statues that ignores people for a living. He saw me see him and tilted the fiddle toward the east. I do not know how the city arranged to make its errands so pretty, but I have always admired it for trying. East meant the yards. East meant Kaia. East meant too much.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d Vale said, before I could explain that I was not at his orders because I am vain about my freedoms. \u201cWe can count on our own. We can be difficult without you watching.\"\n\n\u201cTry,\u201d I said, and there was affection in it because I am capable of that in short bursts. \u201cMake a mess they cannot sweep without wrinkling their shoes. They hate wrinkled shoes.\u201d\n\nI ran. It was not attractive. My body had opinions and none of them were printable. The braid sang its bad little song. The air tried to do the thing air does when you want it to be loyal. I told it a joke about pipes and rats and an emperor who did not have the decency to wear underclothes. It let me pass and then tried to make the man behind me trip. I like the city best when it chooses mischief over obedience.\n\nThe yards were a geometry lesson you fail on purpose. Cranes make gods out of iron until you walk up close and realize they are tired animals held together with rivets and bribery. Kaia had chosen a place between an engine that ought to have died and a pile of tin signs that still believed they were advertisements. She had the red strip tied around her upper arm now, not in her hair. That made me happier than it should have. A woman with a red arm reads differently to the Night than a girl with a red ribbon. Around her were five or six bodies shaped by hunger and good jokes. One of them had the look of a priest who has found God hiding under a sink. Ash leaned on a spool of cable and tried to look like furniture. The dog, the same rude animal who had judged me earlier, had, in violation of all prophecies, decided to be loyal to Kaia instead.\n\n\u201cYou are late,\u201d she said, because some daughters practice on politeness the way other people practice on pianos and get bored early.\n\n\u201cI stopped to tell men how to be heroes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt took less time than you\u2019d hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are better at the costumes,\u201d she said, but there was no acid in it, only a shrug. \u201cCome here. I need your wrists.\u201d\n\nWe do our best work with hands in places that were never designed for hands. She took me by the left and turned my arm as if unscrewing the lid of a jar that will not embarrass itself by refusing to open in front of company. She drew a chalk line over the place where the Oath had used to sit. She put three thin needles through the chalk as if pinning a butterfly that does not want to sit still because it thinks it is still alive. She hummed a song I had not sung to her because I do not deserve to be forgiven at the rate humming accomplishes. Ash watched and did not look away when my blood remembered where to go and then decided it would prefer not to. The dog wagged exactly once.\n\n\u201cYou are moving something,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I thought we finished that braid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe reinforced the bridge,\u201d she said, and her mouth made a little sideways movement that was not entirely laughter. \u201cNow we are putting a tollhouse in. If anyone tries to cross who is not you, they get to explain themselves in a language they do not speak. It will slow the Night long enough for Auntie Knife to steal their pockets.\u201d\n\nAsh bowed from the spine as if accepting a title from a king whose land she already owned. \u201cYou arch,\u201d she said to Kaia. \u201cLike you were born to be a doorway. Try very hard not to let the wrong rooms put their furniture in you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoted,\u201d Kaia said, and blew hair out of her face the way my mother had once done when a pot refused to believe that was its proper heat. \u201cFather. The Archive?\u201d\n\n\u201cOpen,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like your women that way,\u201d she said, and she is allowed to say that to me because she is my daughter and because anger has always been the prettiest thing in this city. \u201cSo. We won\u2019t ask it to be polite. We\u2019ll ask it to keep score. When they come\u2014and they are coming, listen to the way the bolts change their names when they walk\u2014give me three names. Not their big ones. The street-names. I\u2019ll feed them into the rust until it forgets how to remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cKaia,\u201d Ash said softly, in the tone you use when a young one is about to do something both glorious and stupid, \u201cdo not invite too much forgetting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that,\u201d she snapped, and then gentled. \u201cI have been hungry in this city as long as I have been loved. I know the taste and the difference. I will be careful with the forgetting.\u201d\n\nThe Night arrived like a hard word at the end of a sentence. They did not wear their agents who do not scuff. They sent others, the kind who like to be seen. Among them a woman with a jaw made for courtrooms and hands that had written very precise checks. She smiled with her mouth and I recognized a notary\u2019s courtesy. Behind her, five shadows not quite touching the ground and a man who kept adjusting his cuff as if it had disappointed him by being linen.\n\n\u201cKaia of the unregistered mouth,\u201d the woman said, unfurling a piece of paper that was not paper and let the air taste the ink. \u201cBy the authority of the Night Registry and the laws of cooperative survival you are to be collected for processing. We admire your work. We regret the lack of proper documentation. We will provide documentation after the fact.\"\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t ask for documentation,\u201d I said. \u201cShe asked for three names.\u201d\n\nThe woman did me the favor of being amused. \u201cYou are no one,\u201d she said. \u201cYour mouth is no one. Your paper is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014the one you wrote,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd were paid for. And had notarized by a man who was tipsy on plum wine and sang to his cat when he stamped it. You do not get to pretend it isn\u2019t yours because you don\u2019t like the mirror.\u201d\n\nAsh laughed and it was the sound of a blade coming out of a sheath that has been oiled by love. \u201cTell her the bear has moved,\u201d she said to me, and I did, and the woman\u2019s eyes did the thing expensive glass does just before it chips.\n\n\u201cYou have no standing,\u201d the woman repeated, choosing to pretend that words can answer more than once if you press them the right way.\n\n\u201cStanding,\u201d I said, and the yards under my feet agreed and the rail agreed and the cranes with their tired animal bones agreed and the dog wagged again because even dogs know when a pun works, \u201cis what I have when I am here. Three names, Kaia.\u201d\n\nThe first was said in the way mothers used to call sons inside at dusk. The second was mumbled in baths where women practiced being brave. The third was tucked into the seam of a boot when a boy realized he could run and get somewhere important. Kaia took them with her fingers and fed them to the rust, and the rust opened its mouth and chewed until the three names could not be used against anyone again without tasting of iron. I watched the woman\u2019s face realize what had been eaten. She had a good face for disappointment. It took it like a cream and made it useful.\n\n\u201cYou are going to make this uglier than it needs to be,\u201d she said to me. \u201cYou are going to injure the people you think you are saving. You are going to make us take your city away with tools you taught us how to use.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to have our rust,\u201d I said, and Kaia smiled as if I had finally passed an exam she had been ready to grade for years. \u201cYou can have our marbles and our marble and our people with names that fit inside your mouths. You do not get our tired metal that sharpens itself at night. That belongs to us.\u201d\n\nThey came anyway. Of course they did. Laws are umbrellas in hail. The first agent stepped over the place where Kaia had made the tollhouse and tripped without falling. He looked down, insulted. Ash flicked a wire at his ankle and told the wire to remember a dance. It obliged and the man had to teach his limbs how to be useful all over again. The woman with the jaw opened her mouth to call for a more violent shape and I laid my hand on the engine that had never learned to die, and I offered it my braid.\n\nIt did not care about politics. It cared about being a machine. It loved that I respected its old pride. It coughed and spat and then did what machines do when you let them be what they are: it made a noise no one had planned. Some men run at noise, some go still, some step back, and the ones who wanted to be seen stepped forward because vanity is strong. The rust took their names faster when they stepped into its teeth.\n\nWe do not win when we are outnumbered and the other side does not need sleep and the audience is large enough to try on courage. We get a margin. Today that is all I had promised and all I was ready to be. We did not hold them. We gave them splinters. By the time Sevrin found us because he always does, the woman had collected two of our best jokes and a boy who had not yet learned to count to eight without using toes. Kaia had bled once and wiped it on her arm with a face that said blood is not particularly interesting when it is yours. Ash had lost her knife and gained a screwdriver and discovered it cut better in this weather. The dog had chosen one ankle and made it his job for the day. I had spent almost the last thread of my braid and it was beginning to hum as if remembering a lullaby that had killed better men.\n\nSevrin did not call my name this time. He did not need to. He took in the map and drew a better one. He lifted his hand half an inch and six of the air-wearers found a reason to be reassigned. He spoke to the woman with the paper under his breath and her jaw went from courtroom to kitchen. He turned to me and for a moment I saw the boy two hundred years ago singing to a cat because the stamp made a good sound.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have made your scene. Give me the remainder of your hour and I will spend it throttling my own to keep them out of your pockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot keep your mouth clean forever,\u201d Ash said cheerfully in his ear. \u201cYou\u2019ll swallow a tooth.\u201d\n\nHe ignored her, which was brave. He looked at Kaia and said, careful as if the name would argue with him, \u201cI am sorry I brought plums to a child it turned out I would someday try to starve.\u201d\n\nShe raised her chin the way women do when they refuse to be made responsible for your guilt. \u201cBring more plums,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sign your name to a paper you don\u2019t want children to read.\u201d\n\nHe smiled without the part where mouths become weapons and it made him look as if he could die. I am not sure whose mercy that was for.\n\nThen he took my elbow not because he thinks I am fragile but because he knows what happens to a bridge when too many coats cross. \u201cCome,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us finish a piece properly. We will give your daughter a quarter of an hour with her friends and you will come and be forgiven in a way that makes you more useful to our accountants.\u201d\n\n\u201cForgiven,\u201d I said, and felt the braid fray and felt the apology I do not deserve jostle with the anger I have no right to and decided to take neither. \u201cWe will make a different verb.\u201d\n\nHe nodded as if we had agreed on the price of fruit. He is tired. He is old. He is wearing a night that suits him and a conscience that doesn\u2019t. We walked together back into the part of the city that believes in the kind of light that makes paperwork legible. Behind us someone began to laugh about a dog who had learned to bite linen without tearing it. Ahead of us the handless face waited to be told what to do with its empty.\n\nOn the steps of the Apse the junior nocturnals stood like salt shakers at a table set for a feast that had not decided whether to happen. The Countess had changed dresses, which means she had changed tactics. Mire sat as if men who sit decide things. In my chest the little old machine that had taught me about ticking lifted a paw. It informed me, politely, that we were at the place in the day when the bell remembers why it bothers. I thought of Kaia\u2019s hand on my wrist and the way she had taught my geas to be a plank instead of a mouth and I thought: if we are all making a world, some of us should be nails. I followed Sevrin in and I did not lower my eyes.Chapter Six\n\nThe Apse kept its temperature the way old wounds keep their ache. The marble took my footprint and gave me nothing back. The handless face watched as if time were a trick only children believed, and perhaps we were all children, trying to make a rule with our mouths and a game with our hands. Mire did not stand to greet us; he does not stand unless someone has fallen. The Countess had changed to ash silk with a border of beads that looked like drops of blood being taught to behave. The junior nocturnals had found new pens that pretended to be birds. Sevrin\u2019s shoulder was a square you could lean punctuation on.\n\n\u201cYou are late to your own ending,\u201d the Countess said, her voice all bright rooms and indictments wrapped in lace. \u201cI suppose we cannot be surprised that an instrument forgets the player once it tastes applause.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am here,\u201d I said, because it is sometimes the only sentence that does anything in a room convinced of its own geometry. The weight at my back had learned a new rhythm in the yards: it wanted to be a heartbeat and was offended that I did not have one to offer. It thudded anyway, a fake metronome for a dance we were not rehearsing.\n\nMire set his fingertips together like a tent for a saint with nowhere else to sleep. \u201cStrip the poetry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have arithmetic to do. You rescinded, and the Archive admits it. You threaten intercalation, which is vandalism masquerading as wit. You demand parole in public. You have a daughter who has taken a bite of our information and found it to her taste. You stand, therefore, at the place we reserve for problems we will not yet call enemies. Give us the piece of this you still intend to control.\u201d\n\nI found it difficult not to admire, in some private corner of myself that had never been successfully legislated, the economy of his inventory. \u201cThree things,\u201d I said, holding up no fingers because counting with your body in front of predators is an invitation to inventory. \u201cFirst: recognize the Open Forum as precedent and not indulgence. The bell tolled; the mouth declared; the handless face watched. Codify it. Thirteen and thirteen, no overt enforcement, no covert violence, no anchors laid within the amphitheater\u2019s radius as defined by the bones of the old stacks. Write it. Stamp it. File it where your eldest can find it with their eyes closed. Second: a moratorium on tithes in the river wards for twenty-one dusk-cycles. Call it an audit. Call it a festival of restraint. Call it a test of nobility if you want to admire your reflection while you count. But stop the bleeding and say you meant to. Third: safe conduct pledged under your seal and mine for Kaia\u2014named and unnamed\u2014and for General Vale\u2014named and numbered\u2014to their places named earlier. I have already spent the city\u2019s patience. I am spending yours now. Spend something back.\u201d\n\nThe Countess tilted her head so that the beads on her collar whispered to her collarbones. \u201cYou are cute when you threaten us with paperwork,\u201d she said, toy-sweet and salt underneath. \u201cYour second demand is clumsy. Even benevolence scandals if performed wrong. The wards will think hunger is a trick you taught them. The Registry will think you are trying to embarrass its accountants. You are. Mire hates that.\u201d\n\nMire did not waste a movement on confirming what anyone in the room could have named. \u201cWe will not be bullied into philanthropy. But we can be persuaded into decorum. We will accept the first. We will perform the third in the manner already begun. For the second\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCall it calibration,\u201d Sevrin said, in the tone one uses to explain to clever children that the game was meant to be educational. \u201cThe tithes have drifted. A modest recalibration allows us to claim prudence. Two wards, seven cycles, public notice published under the Observatory\u2019s crest. All parties may pretend to be annoyed. No one must starve today for appearance\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nI turned my head to look at him and saw, just briefly, the shape of the man who taught me to taste iron in fruit without making a face. He had put a word in the only place Mire kept space for kindness\u2014the column that balances the ledgers. Mire made an irritated sound that could have been a laugh once and moved one ring a fraction higher on his finger. \u201cDo it,\u201d he said, and four pens scratched at once, the room\u2019s version of applause.\n\n\u201cNow we come to the price you will pay for acting as if footnotes are levers,\u201d the Countess went on, voice gone lantern-bright. \u201cYou rescind. The Oath leaves your bones. The shape remains. We cannot leave the shape unfilled or there will be drafts in the walls we did not design. You will name a proxy for the portion of your knowledge we refuse to lose. You will place your true name shard\u2014don\u2019t preen, Kade, you are not the only creature who keeps a mirror in his mouth\u2014in escrow with the Archive for the duration of this moratorium. Insurance. Not an executioner\u2019s hobby. Think of it as responsible governance.\u201d\n\nI touched my tongue to my palate. The shard lay there like a coin under a tongue on a dare. \u201cYou put your hands in my mouth,\u201d I said. \u201cAlways so intimate for people who do not eat.\u201d\n\nSevrin\u2019s eyes flicked to the handless face and back to me. \u201cYou have a dead-man\u2019s switch,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not waste our time denying what you are most proud of. If we break the Open Forum, if we bruise the parole, if we take what we just signed from your daughter\u2019s skin\u2014your switch trips and the Clock remembers morning in a way that will give our elders palpitations they have not practiced for. I cannot curate panic. Untidy. Give us something that says you will not do that for lesser provocations. Give us something we can carry to the elders that isn\u2019t just your reputation and my bad temper.\u201d\n\nHe had called the crater in me by its name and asked me to fill it with something other than my taste for spectacle. It is disarming, when an old friend refuses to pretend he thinks you are being noble. \u201cYou will have a key, then,\u201d I said. \u201cBut not to the switch. To the bag it sits in. A bag you cannot open alone. Third-party escrow. Not your Archive. Not mine. Aunties\u2019 Registry.\u201d\n\nMire made a sound that did not have room for vowels. The Countess laughed so sharply one of the junior nocturnals wrote down her laughter as if it had teeth you could catalog. \u201cYou want us to let the feral women under the Leviathan hold our crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, darling, do it. If we must be modern, let us be modern with knives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis city already holds your crisis,\u201d I said. \u201cI am just naming the drawer. The Aunties have long memories and bad manners. Perfect ... stewards. Ash will keep the switch in her kitchen sugar tin. You will leave her matches alone and bring her oranges when you\u2019re invited. If you try to take it with hands you call clean, it will bite and then you will be embarrassed in front of children. You do not like that.\u201d\n\nI could feel Sevrin putting the proposal into one of his internal boxes and shaking it to see if anything inside ratted. He liked that there were children in the deal. He did not like that there were knives. He liked anything that gave him something to protect that was not just us. He said nothing. Mire, because he understands when he is cornered and when pretending not to be makes him smaller, nodded once. \u201cWrite it,\u201d he said again, and the pens moved like fish in a feeding.\n\nThe marble under my feet had been built to transmit voices upwards; we were standing in a mouth. I thought, briefly and impolitely, of the day I had given my Oath. It had been in a smaller room with walls that wore the color of milk past its date. A boy had brought a tray with six sheets of silver leaf and a porcelain bowl of water that believed itself holy until it saw what we asked it to carry. Sevrin had stood at my left and the Archon of that day\u2014older, greyer, more polite, long since recycled into law\u2014had stood at my right. I had chewed the leaf because you do not taste the law unless it tastes you. I had said the words and felt them find the hooks in my bones they\u2019d been carved for. I had been asked, very prettily, if I understood the difference between instrument and agency. I said I did and I didn\u2019t and both answers were true. There had been no daughter then, only the possibility of not having one. You do not have to be forgiven, to be allowed to remember.\n\n\u201cNow say your rescission again,\u201d the Countess murmured, bright with hunger and interest. \u201cI would hear it in the big room. The small room has a cheap echo.\u201d\n\nI stepped into the circle where someone had once intended incense and someone else had decided that smoke made people imagine bad things. The braid at my back knotted briefly as if seated more comfortably. \u201cUnder the Truces of Long Dusk and the Oaths of Necessary Instruments,\u201d I said, in the tone that makes the Archive put on spectacles and look up, \u201cI, Kade-of-three-names, rescind consent. I withdraw. I reassign my usefulness to the city that taught me to count and to the aunties\u2019 tin that keeps other people\u2019s secrets without pretending to bless them. I do this under clause of contamination, clause of irreparable conflict, clause unwritten and therefore inevitable. Witness me.\u201d\n\nThere are rooms that applaud. The Apse does not. But something in the stone marked me, like chalk on a suit jacket shoulder at a party you have to stay at because your ride is drunk. Mire flicked two fingers, meaning: proceed. Sevrin\u2019s mouth did not move but I felt him mouth the last word along with me, not out of solidarity. Out of habit. That is worse. Habits are more binding than any good spell.\n\n\u201cNow you will give us your shard,\u201d the Countess said. \u201cAnd you will be walked to the Archive vault and you will place it between pages you cannot see. You will do this meekly and without invoking grandmothers or bridges. You will remember that you are alive because we thought it would be more interesting.\u201d\n\nI took the shard from my mouth and tasted iron and light and the sick vanilla of paper that has been too ambitious about its own scent. The thing looked like nothing. That is how you recognize the important objects. They refuse to be polite. I kept it on my tongue and did not place it in my palm. \u201cThe shard goes to Ash,\u201d I said. \u201cOr to whichever Aunt has firm hands and a better kettle. You may escort it to her door. You may count her matches without touching them. You may pretend, if it helps you sleep, that you are participating in a modernization initiative.\u201d\n\nMire\u2019s eyelids did the thing they do when someone else\u2019s joke insists on standing up and being introduced. He disliked this, and he would accept it. \u201cSevrin,\u201d he said. \u201cGo and be charming. Negotiate with the bear. Return before your elders ask why you are not present for the meal.\u201d\n\nSevrin half-bowed, the old habit again, and then turned to me. \u201cYou look like a man who has to choose whether to faint in front of his enemies,\u201d he murmured. His voice is a good knife because it never pretends not to cut. \u201cStay vertical until we finish knitting this into the city. Then I will allow you to collapse, and I will put a blanket over your knees and call it mercy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will call it debt,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know me. I do not carry blankets into people\u2019s houses without writing the date on the tag.\u201d\n\nWe moved, the room moving around us because the Apse has always adjusted itself to look better in its own stories. The corridor to the Archive smells like chalk and the last person who did not understand how to keep records. The handless face above us showed nothing, which is a kind of loyalty. Two Juniors took up places behind me and tried to walk without sound. The braid took this as challenge and thumped on each step as if to say: if you will not acknowledge me as a heart, I will be a drum.\n\n\u201cYour Countess will try to make my daughter help you dress your wound,\u201d I said quietly to Sevrin when the dark of the corridor covered our mouths and made them feel private. \u201cShe will make it look like patronage. She will bring ribbons and notions and make her laugh against her will, and when the laughter is done she will have placed a hook or two in the silk. Stop her. Not because I asked. Because for once you should deny yourself a beautiful instrument.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not mine,\u201d he said, with a weariness that landed on his shoulders like a patient cat. \u201cNeither of you are. That has always been the difficulty. You are not the sort of toys that sit where one leaves them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was designed to be a toy that writes its own instructions,\u201d I said, and he did not disagree, which was not kindness. It was a fact with its shoes off.\n\nThe Archive\u2019s door is older than any oath we have on file. It was a gate once in a city that had different teeth. When you put your palm to its wood you can feel the places where hands were allowed or forbidden, and all the ghostly yeses and nos lay one atop another so thick you could call it velvet if you were the sort of person who liked to make metaphors buy drinks. The woman in the vestibule looked at us both, at our collars and at the shadow that follows every vampire like a well-trained dog, and then she did a strange thing for a night like this: she smiled as if we were her nephews and had brought her gossip instead of trouble.\n\n\u201cYou make us busy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you also make my hours interesting. Come in. Take your shoes off in your heads. We do not like mud in here, but we do like honest feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cEdda,\u201d Sevrin said, inclining his head. \u201cI will bring you lemons when I am allowed to shop again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will bring me stories, child,\u201d she said, and then looked at me. \u201cAnd you will keep your clever hands off the spines you wrote because you will be tempted to add an apology to the margins. Do not. The Archive does not enjoy contrition. It wrinkles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am out of apologies,\u201d I said. \u201cI have angry footnotes. They fit better.\u201d\n\nWe did not go to the vault. The vault is for things the city refuses to remember and does not yet know how to forget. We went to the Annex of Binding Instruments, where the air has learned to lie down when told and the shelves carry more law than literature and treat both as recipes. Edda gave us a table that had been used for bread long before it learned to host betrayal. She set down three cups and poured hot water over dried mint and something else that tasted like a green that had never seen light. \u201cPut it down,\u201d she said, and I did not, and she raised one eyebrow in a way that made my mother\u2019s ghost, if she has one, check its hair. \u201cOn the wood, Kade. The tin women are not afraid of your name. Why are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt leaves a taste in the air,\u201d I said, and laid the shard down anyway. \u201cI am vain enough to aim it.\u201d\n\nSevrin took a small square of blue paper from his sleeve and put it next to the shard. A train ticket, corner chewed. I had not told him about the tin. He had gone to Ash enough times to learn she likes coupons better than crowns. The Archive settled, in that slow way the elderly use to tell a joke with a long setup. Edda took a cord and made a loop and then a slip and then not a knot at all, and still the packet held. \u201cThis is not escrow,\u201d she said to Sevrin with the mild disdain one reserves for students who try to show off their penmanship. \u201cThis is trust. It only looks like rope so you can bear to believe in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a man who survives on trust,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou are this afternoon,\u201d she said, and tucked the loop into a wooden tray carved with ivy and numbers, and just like that, a piece of me went with a piece of my friend to a kitchen where knives are cleaned with bread ends and arguments are paused to let the dog in.\n\nI should have felt lighter. The braid had other ideas. It misunderstood the removal as invitation. It wound itself twice around whatever the part of me is that shivers when I am watched and pulled. The edge of my vision acquired moths. I put my palm flat on the table and felt the ghost crumbs of other people\u2019s vows. A stranger\u2019s flour can be as consoling as old hymnals. \u201cNow,\u201d I said to Sevrin, because it was rude not to give him what he had earned, \u201cI am going to unwrite a clause into the Clock.\u201d\n\nHe did not flinch. He has learned to contain his flinches in bottles and admire them in private. \u201cYou will not do it here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will not use my Archive for a prank which is not a prank. You will go to the Observatory and you will speak to the face that pretends not to care and you will do it under the eyes of the sky you deny my elders. And you will bring me back the piece of handless you promised your auntie, because if we are to be kissed by scandal we might as well get a souvenir.\u201d\n\nEdda set down her cup very carefully. \u201cDo not chip my table,\u201d she said. \u201cThe last man to unwrite law on it had to sleep in my vestibule for a fortnight because his mouth forgot how to stop.\u201d She looked at me differently then, as if trying to see whether I was trees or paper made from them. \u201cIf you put your hand in the face, you will not get the same hand back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a toy,\u201d I said, and my smile tasted of copper. \u201cMy parts are replaceable.\u201d\n\nIt was not bravery. It was a statement about manufacture. Sevrin took that the way he takes whisky when he does not want to admit to liking it. \u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore your daughter decides to offend someone I am trying to like.\u201d\n\nWe left Edda with her cord and her amused contempt. The Annex door closed on us like a big book. The corridor let us rehearse a thousand disagreements and shelved all of them because the Archive does not keep anyone\u2019s tantrums. When we reached the stair, the city turned its head in its sleep and showed us one bloodshot eye. Outside, the air had decided to smell like metal that believes in rain. Children ran past with their mouths open, catching words the way other children catch snow. Somewhere a kettle declared independence and someone cheered.\n\nAt the bottom step Sevrin paused, and I stopped because it is dangerous to move when someone else intends your step. \u201cWhen we are done,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will not come back with me to the Apse. You will not let me walk you into a room where men like Mire can make shapes out of your resignation and call them jurisprudence. You will go to the Observatory and then you will go to the Bridge that Isn\u2019t and then you will walk into the door that lies and you will sit in a chair and you will teach your daughter how to make tea the way your mother failed to teach you because you were busy writing footnotes. You will give me no more scenes to tidy today.\u201d\n\nHe had made a request. He had couched it in commands because that is how both of us keep from admitting to each other that we still know how to ask. \u201cIf they come for her\u2014\u201d I began, and he cut me off with a small, precise slice of the hand.\n\n\u201cThey will,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I will put my body where it embarrasses the others to step, and I will call it budgeting. Do not make me spend my last.\n\nThe Observatory lives on stairs and breath. The colonnade was a rib cage for a creature that had practiced inhaling a thousand years and still hadn\u2019t made a sound it liked. I put my palm to a pillar and let it recognize me. We were not friends. We were something else. I climbed and the braid counted wrong on purpose to force the steps to pay attention. The bell above us was a sleeping animal with a mean temper and a sense of humor. I loved it. It has always preferred to ring when no one believes in it.\n\nThe handless face is not smooth. From below it looks like emptiness. Up close you can see the grooves where hands once learned to tell people what hour was pretending to be important. The metal is pocked with what time does to things that pretend to be above it. No one puts their hand into the face because the Observatory knows how to bite. I had put my hand there once, long ago, on the night the Oath cemented. I had traced a pocket where numbers could hide. I have been accused of many crimes; hiding places is my favorite.\n\n\u201cDo not faint,\u201d I told my knees, and they looked offended at being thought that sentimental. I reached up. The metal tasted of pennies and rain and the inside of a grandfather\u2019s coat. I found the seam my past self had cut for today and slid two fingers along it as if convincing a violin to like me. The pocket opened like a mouth keeping a secret. The braid stiffened and then lay down, surprised to find a floor where it expected teeth.\n\n\u201cYou called the clause,\u201d I told the face, naming the thing ticks do not think they are doing. \u201cOpen Forum. Parole in the open. The bear has moved. A day is missing and will be returned by post. I unwrite the part that lets them refer to footage as sufficient witness. I rewrite witness to require breath visible. I rewrite breath visible to include fog and steam and laughing in small groups. I write that the bell counts as a witness if rung by a child on a bicycle who believes in luck. I write that thirteen becomes fifteen when the handless sees a hand raised without permission. I write the morning into the pocket as escrow. I make it conditional. I shut it with my mouth.\u201d\n\nThe Observatory does not approve of performance. It tolerates a certain degree of poetry when it gets the job done. My hand shook a little, and then a lot, and then stopped because the face tightened on my fingers like a hungry aunt and I had to keep very still if I wanted to keep any of them. I gave the clause my breath. There are days you can do work with sighs. This was not one. I had to spend something that thinks it is mine. It took. It burned. It left a sweetness like a wound licked clean.\n\nDown below, the city made a sound that might have been someone dropping a crate of bolts and might have been a man deciding not to swing his stick just yet and might have been a bell in the mouth of a boy who had decided his luck needed reminding. The Observatory smiled in metal. The pocket closed on itself. I pulled my hand back and counted. Five fingers. All present. The smallest did not quite remember its name. That is the price of rewriting. You lose labels and learn shapes.\n\n\u201cTake your souvenir,\u201d I muttered, to no one and to Ash and to Edda and to my own habit of paying debts when the balance sheet says I should leave town. I levered off a sliver from the edge where the face pretends not to be fastened. It came away too easily and cut my thumb in apology. The blood looked like theater against the old metal. I tucked the shard into my pocket and the weight in my back thanked me in the only language it has: it stopped pretending I was not tired.\n\nOn the stair down, I met a child with a bicycle and a bell that had decided to be brave even when ignored. He looked at me with the entitlement only children and ancient institutions share. \u201cIs there going to be morning?\u201d he demanded, without greeting and with the efficiency of a city that hates oratory and loves results.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be mischief,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd if you keep ringing exactly when you feel like it, you will get accused of being a saint. Saints are terrible at bedtime. Think before you volunteer.\u201d\n\nHe considered this gravely, then rang his bell five times in defiance of common counting, and pedaled away with the sort of concentration you envy if you have not felt simple for a while.\n\nBy the time I reached the bottom, the braid\u2019s singing had become more of a hiss. Two hours was a generous promise when made by a woman whose clock keeps better time than mine. I had spent the generosity. I had bought three things with it and stolen a fourth and needed to pay on a fifth. The city\u2019s breath was a little higher in its chest. The ink we had taught to move like agents had retreated to revise its strategy. The amphitheater throbbed with stories of people who had not crossed a bridge and had done something else instead. The yards smelled like oil and victory and loss, which is to say: like dinner in a poor season.\n\nI did not go to the Bridge That Isn\u2019t. If I did, I would be tempted to stand on it and invent a speech and make someone else finish it. I turned my feet to the Always Closed. The door has a habit of opening when it must and a stiffer habit of staying absolutely itself when people come with paper. I knocked with the knuckles I had not broken yet and then opened it because I have never learned what closed means in this city. The stairs sighed like a woman who has finally taught the bread to rise. The kitchen smelled like pepper and the last of the sugar. Ash sat with her elbow on the table and a string between her teeth, winding it around a pair of nails in a pattern that looked like the skeleton of a map.\n\n\u201cYou look like a man someone pulled out of a river and shook,\u201d she said, without looking up. \u201cPut your souvenir down with the others. We are going to need a clock that refuses to answer when called.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are others who stole pieces?\u201d I asked, and put the sliver down next to a different sliver and a flake and a very small screw you could pretend was anything.\n\n\u201cEveryone keeps trophies,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people are embarrassed by the word. I am not. Sevrin brought me a lemon I did not ask for and a promise he did not know how to keep. Edda sent me rope and told me it was trust. Your daughter brought me names and asked me to boil them until they screamed. We are making a soup. The Night will complain about the smell. Let them.\u201d She looked at me, finally, and her gaze did the thing certain knives do when they find a hair in their line. \u201cSit,\u201d she said, and I sat, because when a woman who has trained her kitchen to become a war room tells you to sit you remember that chairs were invented for falling into.\n\nKaia came in from the other room with a smear of grease on her cheek and the look of someone who had decided to be merciful precisely once today. \u201cYou do not have to say anything,\u201d she said, which is merciful for a woman raised by men who overvalue words. \u201cWe have a quarter of an hour before the Night pretends to understand what it lost. We are going to use it to build three hinges and a doorstop. Give me your hands.\u201d\n\nShe took them without ceremony and turned them over, palms up, as if checking whether I had brought enough coin to buy what we were selling. She ran her fingertip along the crease below my thumb, following the line a schoolchild might have called life before learning better. She nodded, as if I had passed something, and then did the other. \u201cYou are going to sleep,\u201d she said, and the Countess would have made it a cruelty and a caress and Kaia made it a schedule. \u201cNot now. After. I will watch. Auntie will steal the boots off the men in the doorway. Sevrin will pretend to have chosen the right side for once because if he does not he will have to tell a story later that makes his mouth taste like flour. In the morning\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCareful,\u201d Ash said. The word was not about superstition. It was about advertisements. There are some words that bring attention like flies bring trouble.\n\n\u201cIn the afterward,\u201d Kaia amended, humor flat and useful, \u201cwe will not give speeches. We will turn off one machine and turn on another. We will hang a red cloth out the window so the children will know which door has bread. We will teach the dog to sit. We will teach the Night to knock. We will not be polite if they forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cI withdrew,\u201d I said, hearing how small that sounded in a room that had been busy without me. \u201cI put myself on a shelf where I do not belong and told the librarian what to write on the spine. They will come and take me down and bend the cover back and break the glue. I am telling you this because I am very tired of pretending I have enough clever left to stop them.\u201d\n\nKaia stood very still for the length of time it takes to decide to be kind. \u201cYou are not a book,\u201d she said at last. \u201cYou are an engine. Engines can throw rods and still be terrifying. Engines can sit in a yard for a century and still make teenagers fall in love. Engines are allowed to be ugly when they work. Others will put their hands on you and make you pancakes and get burned. They will act as if it was your fault and you will act as if they are right because that is how guilt thinks it earns its keep. Stop it. Let us be burned because we chose to. Let us turn you over. Auntie has a wrench.\u201d\n\nAsh already had it in her hand. She is that sort of woman. \u201cYou have a little time,\u201d she said. \u201cUse it to lay a fuse so clean even the elders will admire it when it goes off. Use it to whisper a riddle into the handless so that when the Night asks a number it cannot count to, the city will laugh. Use it to tell your friend with the tidy suits that if he is going to keep showing up for people he should carry change for the bread lad\u2019s pocket and stop pretending coins are dirty. The Registry falls apart when it cannot pay exact.\u201d\n\nSevrin had not come in. He is not a man who roots himself anywhere there are curtains. He stood in the doorway like a parent owl pretending to be bad at flying so the children will not ask him to do tricks. \u201cYou are insufferable,\u201d he said to Ash, who curtseyed without standing. \u201cAnd you smell like a kitchen my grandmother would have been proud to starve in.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you smell like a boy who broke all his mother\u2019s cherubs because you wanted to see if they had blood,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cBring me oranges next time you intend to be insolent.\u201d\n\nHe turned to me and put two fingers against my temple as if reminding himself I still had a skull. \u201cYou will come when I call,\u201d he said. \u201cNot because the Oath binds you. Because you like being needed. I am calling. The elders will require a performance. You have written a good scene. Come and take your bows. If you do not, they will replace you with a poorer actor and I will be bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always enjoyed an honest review,\u201d I said, and he rolled his eyes because we have always used banter like gauze; it keeps the flies out while we decide where to make the cut.\n\nThe kitchen thickened with the noise of a city considering whether to be coy or to be itself. Somewhere a window banged with impatience. Somewhere the river rattled its chain. Somewhere the bell decided not to ring and rang anyway because boys on bicycles are insubordinate by birthright. We had a quarter of an hour, perhaps less. Kaia pushed the grease off her cheek with the back of her wrist and left a streak that looked like war paint someone chose to keep after the party. Ash breathed, once, and lit a match and blew it out and lit it again until the smell convinced the room it was time to wake.\n\nI stood and the braid reminded me I owed it a song. \u201cI will come,\u201d I said to Sevrin. \u201cI will stand in your Apse and I will let your elders test the ropes on my wrists and I will make a joke about the knots and you will not laugh and the Countess will. I will do this because the city likes a tidy ending and because messy middles exhaust the young. But before I go I will put one more footnote where you will regret it when you find it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake it scandalous,\u201d he said, and his mouth did a small thing in one corner that used to be called affection. \u201cMake it so clever they think you are foolish for having missed it, and then make it cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very tired of being cruel,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I am very good at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour daughter is better,\u201d Ash said, and Kaia did not argue because the argument would have been over whether cruel was the right word and we did not have time to put language on its leash.\n\nWe moved as if the kitchen belonged to a choreography older than any of us. I pinned the braid higher where it could chew on bone not reserved for walking. Kaia put three new needles in where the old ones had grown embarrassed. Ash took the shard of handless and threaded it onto a string with a dried plum pit and a cufflink I recognized from a night I had not survived. Sevrin folded himself into the doorway and unfolded again as if practicing the trick of being furniture. The dog, God bless him, chose my ankle at last and leaned into it with a sigh that admitted to complicity.\n\nWhen we left, the door put on its sign again: CLOSED. It had no time for Always. Always is a kind of promise and the city had too many of those propped unsteadily on counters. The air outside told us who had just lied and who was about to. The street took my feet like a mother who wants to argue while walking. We turned toward the Apse because that is where endings like to drink.\n\n\u201cDo not call the elders \u2018elders,\u2019\u201d Sevrin said, as if imparting a secret that would save me. \u201cCall them by their offices. Never admit to their age. They are obsessed with it. They will hear it as insult.\u201d\n\n\u201cI intend to insult them,\u201d I said. \u201cI am new at being unsubtle. If I am to be forgiven a fashion mistake, let it be that one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would look terrible in sincerity,\u201d he said. \u201cWear sarcasm. It sets off your eyes.\u201d\n\nWe reached the steps and the junior nocturnals did the thing where a spine straightens as if reprimanded by a grandfather. Mire sat with the same stillness as before, but the room had shifted around him, subtle as a woman deciding she will no longer let the men at the end of the table put their drinks on her napkin. The Countess had acquired a small glass bowl of something that looked like candied violets and smelled like funeral sugar. She held it out to me with a smile that had not yet decided whose side of her face it preferred. \u201cFor your nerves,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have those,\u201d I said. \u201cI traded them for a better class of problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe approve,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hate men who keep their lives small so that they can die neatly.\u201d\n\nMire gestured and we took our places. The hall hummed as if the city breathed through its walls. The handless face above us had learned nothing and everything. I lifted my chin so that the braid could rest where it could see and the Archive would hear and the aunties might be tempted to tell a story about a man who took a clock apart with his teeth. Then I began, because it was my turn and because the bell had decided to wait and I have never known what to do with generosity but spend it fast.Chapter Eight\n\nThe elders do not arrive; they declare. The Apse knows when to become a throat and it opened itself as if swallowing would solve governance. A balcony I had never been permitted to notice revealed its gilt ribs and four chairs that had been designed by someone who believed a back should punish a spine until it confessed its name. In those chairs sat people who had been men and women and then had been offices long enough that the sexes had worn down into grammar. Veils are a tired trick if you do not earn them, but theirs were not to hide faces. They were to teach the room to talk upward. Mire did not stand; he tilted his head as if consenting to be framed by higher frames and the Countess smiled without flashing, tasting the air for theater. Sevrin did the thing he never thinks he does where he sets himself to one side of me and slightly behind, as if a painting of syntax might be improved by a word tucked in the margin.\n\n\u201cRegistry,\u201d said the elder in the chair with a wrist wrapped in a narrow band of tarnished silver, and it was not a greeting so much as a jurisdiction. \u201cThe Archive has whispered. The Clock licked its lips. The city attempted wit and then tasted blood. We will determine whether this was clever or disobedient and behave accordingly. Bring the rescinded instrument forward. He will be weighed.\u201d\n\nI have been weighed before. The Oath rooms can make a body tell its mass without scales. This was different. A tray that had never seen fruit, a rod carved with increments so fine you could measure apology, and three small bags of sand labeled with words I could not read unless I chose to be insulted. The junior nocturnals unfolded the apparatus as if presenting tea and I stepped where they showed me because I had already declared myself a man who accepts the procedures when they were built by hands that understand weight. There is a dignity in allowing yourself to be measured. It does not protect you, but it permits you to choose where to hold your chin.\n\nThe Countess drew a small iron stylus from inside a cuff and turned it between two fingers so that the hall could admire the way light lives in metal when it has been allowed to forget other duties. \u201cWe could cut this short and pretend to be merciful,\u201d she said, which is what passes for kindness in a room that does not believe in mercy, and her voice carried easily because she is a woman who toys with acoustics to remind herself she can. \u201cHe rescinded. We accepted the precedent because we approve of clever footnotes when they feed our own appetite for neatness. Now, the Registry asserts the right to salvage. He is an instrument built in our workshop. If he is putting himself on a shelf where others may borrow him, we must label him properly. This is not about blood. This is about inventory.\u201d\n\nMire did not flinch at the demotion to shopkeeper; he is happiest when he can pretend governance is a store that stocks only solutions. \u201cWeigh,\u201d he said, and the junior nocturnals lowered the rod until it kissed the tops of my shoulders and pretended the touch was intimate. The bags of sand declared their guesses when they were applied and the stylus scratched a line on a slate that had outlived three dynasties. Sevrin did not watch the numbers. He watched my breath. He has never been able to help himself when a body near him chooses to be visible.\n\n\u201cOne hundred and seventy-eight regrets and the remainder in disdain,\u201d announced the elder with the silver band as if figuring out what sort of flour we were working with. \u201cNotable, the absence of awe. The presence of stubbornness at a level we would normally expect in apprentice wrestlers and midwives. The anomaly we were warned about\u2014no pulse where pulses are supposed to be\u2014persists. Very well.\u201d The sentence did not end in therefore. It took no pleasure in being a conclusion.\n\n\u201cThis is the part,\u201d I said, keeping my voice in the library register because the Archive enjoys appearances, \u201cwhere you offer to regularize me. You will find a document written during a prior era of elegance, call it the Concord of Tools, and you will tell me I may be classified as an adjunct to the Night in perpetuity in exchange for the restoration of certain comforts. You will make a speech about protection. You will admire your own generosity while noting my ingratitude. To save time, allow me to decline in advance.\u201d\n\nThe Countess flicked the stylus so that it made an agreeable sound against the slate edging, an E if you were charitable. \u201cIt never ceases to delight me that you write our scripts for us in your head and then undercut them as if this were satire,\u201d she said, and she did not look at Sevrin when she added with sugar, \u201cWe should have kept you hungrier. Men this sure need a meal they can\u2019t finish.\u201d\n\nSevrin let breath out through his nose in the polite version of contempt. \u201cHe is sure because you insisted he draw straight lines with no paper under the table,\u201d he said, and whatever else he might be, he is a man who will sometimes pull a chair out for honesty even if it is only for a moment. \u201cGet to the point. You did not convene to canonize his rebellion. You came to take something back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe came,\u201d said the elder with the silver band, \u201cto perform the Reconciliation Weighing and the Counting of Names. He rescinds the Oath; he claims contamination; he removes himself from the instrumentality we purchased with careful oaths and honest deceit. He may leave, and that is terrifying. He may leave, but not with all of the names he holds in his mouth. There is no law\u2014no law we respect\u2014that allows a contractor to walk from a site with the blueprint tucked in his sleeve. He will forget for us. He will forget where he stitched the laws so they bite. He will forget where he left alleys in the wires. He will forget where morning has been banked. We are not monsters when we behave with paperwork. We will file the forgetting. It is not cruelty. It is inventory.\u201d\n\nIt is one thing to allow the Night to strip you of the glamour of being necessary, another to let them reach into your head and take what you have made and rename it a loss. I think I grinned then, not because there is anything savory about losing memories but because I had expected a different kind of divorce. \u201cYou want my maps,\u201d I said, recognizing in their hunger something that had once nursed me. \u201cYou will not take them. You can sit with me and watch while I give them to the Archive\u2019s vestibule aunties in phrases you will not understand because you do not boil your stories. Or you can tear me apart trying and leave the pieces of my names in a hundred women\u2019s kitchens. Either way, you will not be cataloging me in your tidy script.\u201d\n\nMire was still. He has taught himself a stillness so pure that children check to see if he is moved by wind. \u201cYou invented the alleys you used today,\u201d he said, as if reminding me of the thing I am proud of so that I will be more cooperative. \u201cWe can get along with closing those. You inserted toes between cogs in a place none of us had wanted to admit was a machine. We can pretend those toes were our own. But there is one clause we will not allow to remain uncollected. You told a Clock to care about children\u2019s breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was mine,\u201d I said, allowing myself to be satisfied with a detail because the whole would not be allowed to be owned. \u201cYou do not get it.\u201d\n\nThe Countess, who is not a mother and does not aspire to the role because it is a costume that does not flatter her, did not bother to be offended on behalf of the abstraction. \u201cWe will get something,\u201d she said, sounding less playful, and it is always worth taking note of when a woman who enjoys the theater decides to call the orchestra down. \u201cWe lost face today. In this room, that is expensive. In our houses, that is fatal. Deliver us a concession that sings without making the city weep. Hand us a word we can sell to people who are tired and do not feel like learning new songs. You have some left. You hoard vocabulary like a miser with old buttons.\u201d\n\nI have always hated bargaining where the coin is names. It feels like cutting a child\u2019s hair and putting the braid in a drawer because you liked that version better. \u201cYou can have \u2018deference,\u2019\u201d I said, because there are days when you use the polished silver no one wanted anyway. \u201cIt will live in a statute where citizens who want to help can sign their names to public acts without a penalty of disappearance if you do not like their signatures. Make them bow before they speak. Make them call you office and clerk and Registrar and saint. Make them say please on paper. Count those pleases and tell your elders you still own a certain choreography. I will write the clause now. I will make it beautiful enough you can admire yourself in it. The Archive will wince and stamp it. It will save you embarrassment and buy the city time. This is not because I like you. This is because the aunties prefer eyes on the front of heads where they can be found.\u201d\n\nSevrin spoke to the veils, very low, and the veils replied by not moving. \u201cWe can sell them the theater of respect,\u201d he said, doing the arithmetic out loud so Mire could pretend someone else had added it. \u201cWe can force the children to wear gloves at our table. They will call it humiliation and swallow it because swallowing is survival. It gives us a list we can love. It gives them a shield they can hate. And while they hate it, they will organize. We will be less elegant. Kade will be alive. Our elders will learn to say the word calibration without choking. I recommend the purchase.\u201d\n\nThe elder with the silver band flicked a finger and somewhere in the ceiling a quill found the paper. \u201cYou do not recommend,\u201d they said, but they accepted the word. \u201cYou arranged this room. We disapprove of men who choreograph nights we think are ours. We will inventory your insolence later. For now, write deference where it will look best.\u201d\n\nI stepped down from the tray and took the stylus from the Countess before she could perform generosity. The slate accepted my hand with a reluctance I did not take personally. I wrote, slowly, because spectacle is a way to train a room to see the new outline of itself. The words were the sort that can be held by mouths that prefer not to bleed: petition, forum, address, courtesy. Underneath them, braided in a script the Archive taught me when I was young and vain about letters, I wove the teeth. No vanishing of registrants who meet the requirements of breath and bell. No confiscation of tongues licensed for deference. No extraction of anchors from families who choose to say the right new words loudly. I left myself an alley, and I left Kaia three, and I hid a door in a flourish no one but Edda would admire. When I handed the stylus back, the Countess took it as if accepting a knife she intended to use later and thanked me with a nod that was all wrists and no neck.\n\n\u201cThe Reconciliation,\u201d Mire said, and then, because he remembers to be read by other rooms later, \u201cSevrin.\u201d\n\nThis is how it was meant to go: the friend introduces the ritual that takes a piece of you and calls it medicine. Sevrin did not soften it. He never has. \u201cWe will perform the Counting of Names,\u201d he said, between teeth that did not show but could chew, \u201cand Kade will forget three things of ours and one thing of his own. We will not take a daughter\u2019s laugh. We are not interested in petty cruelty. We will take where he left us exposed. We will take something we can use and something we will not have to pretend to mourn. He may choose the shape of the forgetting. If he chooses poorly, I will choose. The Archive will witness, and the bear will be informed as if informing makes any difference to a creature who eats law as if it were the rind of a fruit.\u201d\n\nMy back went very cold then and it was not the braid, which had become a metronome fatigued by an orchestra. One of the elders above shifted and turned some small thing in their hand that made the very old dust think of bones. I thought of the drawer where my mother kept thread and needles and a little pair of scissors with birds for handles that had nipped my finger when I was seven because I had put the wrong thing under their beak. \u201cI choose,\u201d I said, because I have taught rooms like this that I prefer to swing my own axe. \u201cI forget where I threaded blood through the hands of the Old Taxes. I forget the tuning I used on the statutes around the Museum Quarter when we taught the cameras to see less. I forget the phrase that makes my name sit up and wag its tail when the Clock calls. That one is mine and it has been too useful to anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not get to take your favorite toy and hide it in your pillow,\u201d the Countess said lightly, and the elder with the silver band did not rebuke her because truth sometimes dresses like impudence to hold attention. \u201cWe will keep your answer, but you will not keep the last of those for yourself. We will decide who carries your tail.\u201d\n\nSevrin held out his hands as if receiving something that stung only decorum. \u201cI will hold the wag,\u201d he said, just the smallest grimace moving the corner of his mouth because he hates entertaining metaphors that make him ridiculous, \u201cand the rest we will let the Annex pin to a card. Kade, say the forgetting. Do not pronounce it like a charm. Pronounce it like a resignation letter. Leave yourself room to write again.\u201d\n\nThere is a tone you use when you quit, even if you intend to be rehired. I found it and spoke the three places and the one I loved. It is a clumsy thing to describe what it feels like to take a door out of your house while still living in it. The timbers groaned in memory more than in pain. I felt the place where the Old Taxes sing when certain children turn seven go dark to me, not to the world; I felt the Museum Quarter shrug and shutter its eyes; I felt the little trick with my name loosen like a thread cut and handed to a cat. The room did not change. I changed. The Archive made its small sound again, the one I had first learned to fear and then to admire. It registers. It does not sympathize. It writes How and When and leaves Why for meals with friends.\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d said the elder, and the veil downwards looked less like a curtain than like the inside of a mouth that has finally decided to swallow. \u201cHe is lighter by four lies and one truth. He will wobble like a table on an uneven floor until a woman with a folded napkin fixes him. We approve, provisionally. Kade,\u201d and the silver band flashed like a promise and a bruise, \u201cyou are free to leave this status. It will follow. It will watch. It will measure your appetite for afters. Do not come to our counters and ask for sugar. The aunties have it now, and we will behave as if we never did.\u201d\n\nThe Countess dipped her hand into the little glass bowl and touched a violet to her tongue, then made a face that told me they had been soaked in a brandy that had learned the wrong songs. \u201cWhat an unsatisfying stage kiss,\u201d she said, and then brightened, because she enjoys brightening the way cats enjoy watching things fall, \u201cbut I have a toy to unwrap later, and that will make for an excellent bedtime story. Sevrin, walk your friend out, or stand with him and let him pretend you are not escorting him. Either is acceptable. The rest of us will go and count how much of us is left and write a memo saying that the sum is unchanged because we have learned the trick of lying elegantly to ourselves. Mire, be kind to yourself when you read it. You are not a monster; you are a clerk with sharp teeth.\u201d\n\nMire did not acknowledge the indulgence. He stood finally, and when he stands you remember that he had a body once that did other things besides hold rules. \u201cTell your daughter,\u201d he said to me, not bothering to hide that the threat and the courtesy were wearing each other\u2019s coats, \u201cthat when she climbs she should check bolts the city did not put in. Tell the aunties we will bring oranges and not inspection papers if they do not make us say thank you. Tell the boy with the bell that luck is alliance. We do not lose today. We change category.\u201d\n\nOn the steps, the city knocked once, loudly, on a door with no name, and my braid answered with a small, offended thud. Sevrin put his hand under my elbow and I let him without telling him he was being sentimental. He did not take me back down the broad central stairs used by men who like to be seen managing their own descent. He took me along a corridor that narrowed itself with the eagerness of a gossip and came to a door that could never have been there yesterday. \u201cThey wanted to make you forget the Museum eyes,\u201d he said, and here his voice was only voice and not a blade. \u201cThey never knew where you stored the real entry to the feeds. When the day arrives where you hate them enough to break their own image on their own vizier-plates, use that. Not before. I cannot keep the ones behind me from becoming stupid if you hand them cause.\u201d\n\nWe took the new door and it deposited us under the colonnade again without the courtesy of stairs. The sky had developed a cut across it that a painter somewhere would declare a motif and a woman with a cart of bread declared out loud that she had run out because people who do not riot still need to chew. The boy with the bicycle rang his bell very carefully six times the way a man sets knives on a table when he is proud of not cutting anyone, and I nodded to him because there is no reason not to feed a creature who wants to be useful. Sevrin looked at my face the way a doctor used to look at a patient\u2019s tongue in the days when physicians were still permitted to claim they did not know. \u201cYou need to fall,\u201d he said, and I was tired enough to let the sentence be all the irony necessary.\n\n\u201cI have one more obligation,\u201d I said, because for once I had kept count. \u201cI promised to tell Auntie the bear has moved. I promised to bring her a piece of handless. I promised to teach my daughter how to make tea the way my mother failed to teach me because I wanted to pretend the water liked me more than it liked the pot. Then I will come when you whistle. Perhaps I will come before. Habits are leashes. Even when you put them down you can feel the tender wearing where they ran.\u201d\n\nHe did not ask me to be dramatic, and he did not ask me not to be. He touched my shoulder with the pressure he used to use on chess pieces before he learned to move the board without his hands. \u201cToday I will be grateful you are alive,\u201d he said, and he will hate that sentence later when he hears it in his own head with the tone of a boy who believes friendship is sacrament. \u201cTomorrow, I will behave as if you were my enemy badly behaved enough to be amusing. We will both pretend we are consistent. I will send my junior with a letter that looks like a grocery list. Answer it with what oranges cost. We must have something dull to show each other if the elders come to check.\u201d\n\nThe Bridge That Isn\u2019t understood that I had not chosen it. It sulked without dignifying itself with visible sulking, which is the only sulk a bridge can afford. I went to the door that lies instead and it opened because Ash has taught it to. The kitchen had moved three inches to the left the way a cat moves when it has decided to occupy a warmer patch of sun. Oranges sat where a bowl would be if we were the sort of people who bothered with bowls. The dog had claimed my chair and had to be persuaded with bread to vacate his right to my seat. Ash had drawn on the table with a stub of pencil some idea about which street ought to be stubborn on Thursdays, and she did not look up when I came in because she knew my weight and was busy loving a problem. Kaia stood by the stove with a kettle in her hand and not enough water and a frown you could hang a towel on.\n\n\u201cYou pour too fast,\u201d she said, and it was educational, not scorn. \u201cYou pour like a man paying a debt and you think the speed makes it nobler. It turns the leaves bitter. You have to give them a second to decide not to fight you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI left my best patience with someone else\u2019s mother,\u201d I said, and she rolled her eyes in the way that tells a parent their child is not becoming them, which is what anyone sensible wants. She adjusted the kettle and the sound of water changing its mind made the dog sigh and put his head on his paws because certain noises coax animals into remembering the old days before obedience was a job.\n\nSevrin\u2019s junior, a narrow person who looks like penmanship feels and who had once brought ferrisweet to my daughter and been forgiven for it because the sugar had been enough to make the iron tolerable, appeared in the doorway as if decorum had hung a coat on her. She held out a folded paper and kept her eyes down because the kitchen deserved that much respect. \u201cFrom Sevrin,\u201d she said, and the dog barked once as if to declare that all messages in this house must first be vetted by the old sciences.\n\nAsh took the paper and used it as a trivet because no one gets to be precious with their words under her roof. \u201cHe wants oranges,\u201d she said, skimming, and then threw me the glance I had earned by surviving to become useful. \u201cHe wants to know how many and from which stall and whether the woman who shouts at people she likes is there today. He is pretending this only matters because of a cook. You will answer, because we like men who admit to needing fruit.\u201d\n\nKaia poured the water as if she were being kind to it and I watched the leaves accept their fate and unfurl. \u201cYou will sleep,\u201d she said, and it was not an offer so much as an admission of victory. \u201cYou will snore because your body refuses to believe it is an instrument. You will wake up angry because you have trained your mouth to look for something to bite. You will consider sending me away, not because you think I cannot handle being bait but because you finally remembered what a daughter is for and you find yourself ashamed of wanting anything. We will ignore that part. We will eat bread. Auntie will tell a story about a bear who moved into a courthouse and made the clerks pick berries with their bare hands so they would understand the economy they were legislating. We will boil the first of your footnotes and feed it to the cat because he likes tough meat. Then you will go and do whatever it is you do when you want to call it law.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfterward,\u201d Ash said, and she did not look at the door, which is how you ask a city to be polite without telling it to be, \u201cwe will teach the dog to bite sleeves only. Necks are for later. We will teach Sevrin how to come into a kitchen without making the tea taste of marble. We will teach your elders that oranges do not come with receipts unless they are unworthy oranges. We will pin your shard-thing where it can frighten spiders. We will wait for the bell and refuse to wear our good aprons when we answer it.\u201d\n\nIt is astonishing how quickly a body that has argued with ceremony all day can decide to obey when ordered by hands that do not demand an oath. I sat, and the chair accepted me with the approval some furniture reserve for men who have managed to perform one decent trick before dying. I spread the paper and wrote what Sevrin had asked me to write about fruit with the attention one gives to subtle explosives. It is not the groceries that matter. It is the habit of asking. Kaia set the cup by my hand and I smelled the mint recognize the heat and become a better version of itself, and I wanted to weep because smell is the rudest door memory owns.\n\nI drank and the braid relaxed a fraction the way animals always forgive someone who has fed them. The city moved outside like something patient that has decided to lean. I let my head put itself down on my folded arm on the table that had learned to be a battlefield without being asked, and I practiced the most difficult jurisprudence of our time: I permitted other people to continue the defense without my mouth in the room. When I woke, the bell had found some new courage, and an orange sat on the window ledge with the sun pretending it had been there the whole time.Chapter Ten\n\nMorning did not arrive so much as it forgot its manners and came in anyway. The orange on the ledge had taught the window a color it could not quite pronounce, and the kettle startled itself into speech on the first try. I woke with the taste of mint turned forgiving on my tongue and the sense that my back had learned a new way to complain. The braid had settled lower during sleep, like a tenant who had discovered a warmer room, and it nipped when I turned my head because it preferred to be consulted about such things. The dog had chosen the door as his vocation and lay with his nose in the crack as if inhaling the best gossip. Ash had scratched a new map into the flour dust on the table, not as destination but as a reminder that even kitchens prefer to know how to get back to themselves.\n\nKaia did not say good morning because she does not say to the day what the day has not yet earned. She handed me bread and a knife and permission to pretend the crust fought back. When the slice finally lay obedient, she salted the butter without asking because some mercies should never require ceremony. We did our inventory the way people who have learned to survive do theirs, by pretending the list has been the same all along. Oranges, three, one with a bruise that made it sweeter. Needles, five, two already baptized in the part of me that dislikes baptism. String, as if a cat had taken on a second job. Time, enough to argue about the definition of enough and still put shoes on.\n\n\u201cYou snored,\u201d she said first, because praise is impolite and therefore too decadent to spend early. \u201cAuntie wanted to throw a spoon at you, but the dog convinced her the spoon had better uses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am collecting testimonies,\u201d I said, and cut the second piece of bread as if the knife had apologized. \u201cPerhaps I will write a pamphlet. \u2018What My Sleep Teaches Us About Law.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first chapter will be \u2018You Are Not As Quiet As You Think,\u2019\u201d Ash said without looking up from the tin where she was counting matches and lies with the equal tenderness of a woman who likes to have enough of both. \u201cThe second will be \u2018Close Your Mouth Before Your Teeth Collect the Wrong Story.\u2019 Put your elbows on the table and show me the damage.\u201d\n\nI obeyed because kitchens have ranked higher in my life than altars. The place where Kaia had planted the tollhouse had bruised to a purple that looked like a city choosing to wear its colors; the skin around it had learned to be dignified and was accordingly stiff. She tested the anchors with the sort of professional insult a radio learns to enjoy. The needles answered well. The braid pulsed once as if to show off and then allowed itself to be bullied into competence.\n\n\u201cIt will ask again,\u201d she said, with the professional pessimism of a woman who had made a living stealing speech back from stubborn machines. \u201cThings that learn they are wanted begin to get ideas. The weight on you wants to find the biggest stage and teach everyone what it knows. We will bore it. We will take it to errands and make it carry oranges with us until it learns to sit.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of errands,\u201d Ash cut in, and she had in her hand a folded piece of blue paper that had acquired grease on one corner and therefore legitimacy, \u201cSevrin sent his junior back with the names of three stalls where a man with a particular sort of pocket will be treated as if his coins are vegetables. He wants answers, and not poetry, about prices, and whether the woman at Kaina\u2019s steps still insults him for being born wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would insult the moon for having phases,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is her profession and our salvation. I will go with the junior and bargain with courtesy so you can say later that you saw me behave.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will go,\u201d Kaia said, \u201cbecause afterward they will drag you into a theater with a new sign on the door that reads Deference and you should enter first so other people know how to look expensive and still be improper. Eat your bread. The city will not wait for your stomach to finish bargaining.\u201d\n\nShe poured water as if gravity had taught her to be gentle in self-defense and the leaves mimed boats remembering they were forests. Auntie Knife watched us not like an audience but like a proprietor, and when I met her eye she let me see, for a sliver of a second, the part of her day where she goes quiet and counts all the people who can be safely sent to doors and all the doors that can be safely opened. No one appreciates the mathematics of safety until they have had to multiply it by hunger.\n\nWe left with the dog\u2019s blessing and without thanks to the door because gratitude is a kind of advertisement. The junior walked half a step behind us with the entitled misery of someone who has been told not to be seen and dislikes being reminded that invisibility is not an art she chose. She led with competence. The yards smelled of oil that had learned a new song and the river practiced being a straight line until a barge taught it to be reasonable. The city had dressed its wounds to look like jewelry, which is one way to keep your enemies guessing where to cut.\n\nKaina\u2019s steps hosted the same dynasty as last year: the same women with different faces, the same jokes with better timing, the same coins stacking themselves into small towers that wanted to see something. The orange seller insulted us on sight and then relented sufficiently to twist humor into discount; she called Sevrin a velvet knife and apologized for insulting knives by association. We bought cheap and paid dear and left ten words we wanted carried to ears that prefer the market to the Archive. That is how you ensure any law grows: you teach it to gossip.\n\nThe boy with the bicycle appeared without having the decency to look like summons. He rang the bell three careful times and jerked his head toward the old auditorium that had acquired a new vocabulary overnight. He did not wait to see if we followed. He has decided he\u2019s a fate; fates never look back because they are bad at regret.\n\nThe stage had not changed. The words over it had. A canvas hung there awkwardly, as if the room had tried on clothes in front of a mirror that still loved another shape. Deference was stenciled in a font someone had decided meant stability and kindness to grandmothers. People read with their mouths sometimes, in this city, and as each mouth tried the syllables the sound gained a scuff you could use to stop a sliding chair. The Night had posted three clerks and one agent who did not wear the air but wore a look that told it when to move. The Countess stood like a tax on the left and did not pretend to be uninterested. Mire refused to exist in public but had a line of chalk leading away at an angle that promised he could be in the room in thirty seconds without passing a door. Sevrin semaphored boredom from a shadow because he knows what his face does to crowds and refused to spend it mid-morning.\n\nThe first to kneel were the ones with knees that understood the floor. They made a show of not cracking. They unfolded pleas like linen saved for guests who did not come. It was ugly in the way training is ugly when watched, and beautiful in the way a first breath counts even when it is taken for the wrong reason. The deference clause did what I had written it to do: it tied their mouths to breath to visible fog, it made the bell a witness because the bell had taken an interest, it forced the Night to stand like furniture and endure compliments from people they would have preferred to inventory. The clause has a taste when it works. It tastes like a copper coin a child believes to be chocolate because it glows. I dislike that I love that taste. I am allowed to be complicated in my pleasures; I am an adult.\n\nKaia did not kneel. She took the panel that reproduced speech and taught it to be less dignified. She widened the lower frequencies, the ones that usually tell your gut how to feel, and allowed them to ring when the petitioners said please. You should hear what a city does when you make it listen to the word please with its stomach. Men in suits slope their shoulders. Agents of any kind step with their toes instead of their heels. Countesses examine their nails for faults that did not exist this morning. It is obscene how fast etiquette can be weaponized when you return it to people who have never been allowed to like it.\n\nThe Countess did the thing she had promised herself she would do with ribbons. She waited until a pause, then approached Kaia\u2019s left side with a selection of silk and a voice like sympathy holding a needle. She did not offer anything that could be called clothing because she does not insult competence with costumes. She offered ties for cables, loops for tools, a handkerchief to prevent the panel\u2019s teeth from making the hand that feeds it bleed. She complimented like a duet. She offered nothing but convenience and let affection be the trick people inflicted on themselves.\n\nKaia selected the ties that would not fray and declined the handkerchief without making a point of the blood. She took the loop and turned it over twice and tied it in a knot only someone who had taken apart a radio could call graceful. She said thank you to the silk as if silk could be grateful and did not say it to the woman representing polished cruelty. The Countess made the face respectable predators make when told a child has learned to tie her shoes. She had intended to leave a hook in the knot. Kaia left a bell. If the hook was pulled by the wrong hand, the bell would ring in a language that silk understands, and some day the Countess would try to use what she had given and be surprised at the sound her gift made when warned.\n\nThere is theater, and then there is a kitchen, and on certain days the first tries so hard to be the second that both blush. At the fourth petitioner the bell rang at the wrong time and counted fifteen because a man in the back raised his hand without asking permission. The clause flexed where I had written it to forgive that impertinence; the handless face at the Observatory turned its attention to the auditorium as a person does when a word they used to love passes in the mouth of a stranger; Miracles were not invited, and did not arrive, which is always my favorite outcome.\n\nThe bear arrived in a different room entirely. You do not look at her. She looks at you. The courthouse, which does not often get to be a set for stories that remember joy, allowed the aunties to bring the bucket with its lid and a spoon that had learned manners at wakes. The clerks disliked being used as props, which is why they made such excellent props. Somewhere between the door and the first desk the bucket seemed heavier. Somewhere between the second desk and the bench the smell of honey acquired a smell of law. Aunties do not invoke animals. They demonstrate them. Ash stood halfway back in the gallery with a spool of twine in her pocket and a smile that a sensible child would be born knowing to avoid. She shook the tin that used to hold biscuits and now held my shard with the train ticket and a lemon and three paper clips because the city respects substitutes. When the judge attempted to stand, the chair refused to let him in quite the way he preferred. The aunties called out, cheerfully, for hats, and clerks who had stopped wanting to be useful the day they first used ink found themselves carrying honey on the brims of their pride. If you think humiliation and justice should never be arranged to keep one another in humor, you have never had to teach an institution to share. The bear\u2019s paw sat itself on the docket. The docket got sticky. No one in that room would say bear. Everyone would say honey for a month, and in that month every time a form asked for a signature, someone would think of sticking their fingers into a sweetness that made their mouths less polite. Law tastes better after it has been allowed to eat what it wants.\n\nThe auditorium breathed its way through three dozen petitions. People said please and the Night wrote down the shape of their lips and pretended not to keep count. Two men asked for their bakery to be permitted to sell bread at night without the tithe; the calibration spider Sevrin had spun for us already twitched and hauled up a corner of a notice as if letting sunlight in were regard for health. A woman asked that the copied songs that had been banned for their improper watermarks be permitted to play at weddings during the vow and the first dance only. I permitted myself to admire that one because it balanced defiance with superstition in a way that would embarrass the Registry into pretending it had agreed days before. A child whose hair had decided to become ungovernable asked if the bicycle bell could be hung in the amphitheater and counted as witness even when the bicycle had decided to go somewhere else. We wrote it down and we made it so because arguments with children who have rewritten sound are unbecoming in any room.\n\nThey let me speak last, which was a courtesy and a trap. They wanted the taste of law on their tongue when they left as if it were a mint to cleanse the palate, and they wanted to be able to tell the elders they had boxed my words in at the end as if language were a neighbor too loud after midnight and we could call a man with a badge. I chose to thank the bell because it understands gratitude better than men, and then I thanked the people for teaching please the taste of their breath, and then I used the time I had left to name, quietly enough to make the clerk with the beautiful handwriting work for it, all the things anyone should never have to ask permission for again. You cannot legislate mercy without making pornographers of angels. You can inventory rudeness and decide to like it. The Countess let the stylus hover over the slate as if it were a ladybird she didn\u2019t want to scare. She looked bored. Men who like to pretend they do not answer to women do not read correctly the posture in her back when she is about to do math in public.\n\nI stepped off the stage and the braid bit my lower ribs as if reminding me it preferred me to stay in rooms where it could watch to see if its work was admired. Kaia\u2019s hand found the topmost needle and gave it a piratical twist that told it to be quiet in words too short for music. The needle behaved. Sevrin\u2019s shadow detached itself from the wall because it had grown tired of pretending it belonged to the paint. He walked beside me without putting his hand on my arm, which in our dialect is permission to decide whether to ask. \u201cYour clause did not bore,\u201d he said. \u201cThe elders will forgive you three times before they admit you impressed them. That should get you through lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am attempting to wean myself from being interesting,\u201d I said. \u201cIt has made too much trouble for my friends. How was your bear?\u201d\n\n\u201cMiserable,\u201d he said, and there might have been a smile if he had been alone. \u201cMy clerks are sticky. My judge has learned how far the brim of his hat may be trusted, which is further than he had supposed. I am told by a woman who terrifies me without trying that oranges will be brought to the Aunties without anyone attempting to weigh the mesh bags they come in. I am to deliver the bags. I am to remember to say please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will look excellent with the right sort of citrus under your arm,\u201d I said. \u201cIt will distract people from your Latin.\u201d\n\nHe glanced at Kaia as if checking the weather and found a storm he had not prepared for. It is a peculiar experience to watch an old friend fall in love with a different category of courage. \u201cThe Countess will come for her again,\u201d he said, not as warning and not as promise. \u201cShe has found a place in the silk that does not itch, and she will imagine herself gentle. Do you want me to tell her a story that embarrasses her about plums and daughters and the way some men think food is affection and some women do too?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her,\u201d Kaia answered, before I could, because she would not be fathered in rooms where the air had learned her weight, \u201cthat if she brings ribbon I will use it to tie her shoes. Tell her to bend down in my street to fix the knot. Tell her to discover what she sees when she tries to put polite into the gutter.\u201d\n\nHe bowed a fraction of an inch because sarcasm raises deference when delivered well, and then he was gone because the Registry does not wait for men to finish their epigrams. The auditorium folded itself back into a room with a raised speech and a floor that needs sanding. People drifted toward errands. The bell gave itself one last ring and then behaved like an adult. The boy rode past and managed to make speed look philosophical. We stood in the new category of shade available to citizens who have survived a morning.\n\nIn the afternoon the Archive coughed. It was a little sound, like a clerk clearing his throat for someone he likes and doesn\u2019t know how to ask to tea. Edda had sent a child, not the bicycle, but the slow breed who carry words like soup. He came to the kitchen door with his cap folded in his hands and the look of someone who has been told a secret and is dying to be responsible about it. \u201cMissus Edda says her pages itch,\u201d he reported, as if my entire job were to be the man with the ointment. \u201cShe says you left too much of yourself in a margin and now a girl with good penmanship is having dreams about your footnotes. She says that is not hygienic.\u201d\n\nI went because it is good manners to answer your own mess. Kaia came with me because the Archive had learned her smell yesterday and would be less inclined to kick. Ash declined because kitchens must be defended from sudden visitors with nice pens. The walk to the annex was shorter than it had been because I could not be made to get lost properly in halls I had taught to lie, and Edda met us at the vestibule as if we were bread she had been waiting to take out of her oven. She looked at me in that way only elderly women are permitted, half insult and half absolution, and then took my wrist as if checking for a pulse and consenting to find disappointment lovely.\n\n\u201cYou put romance in a statute,\u201d she said, not admiring and not cruel. \u201cThe girl who copies the nice hand got a poem in her soup. She doesn\u2019t need that. You may be handsome in your own head, but you are not for girls writing receipts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not intend\u2014\u201d I began, and she cut me with a chin.\n\n\u201cOf course you did not. No one intends the angles of their handwriting to become a lesson for someone else\u2019s body. This is why we have aunties and doorways and the nice habit of brooms. Come in and root yourself. Take back the flourish you did not need. Leave us the teeth.\u201d\n\nIt was the oddest sensation, to reach into a letter that had laughed and extract the part that had wanted to be pretty while punishing itself for not being loved enough. The clause sat in my hand for a moment like a cat you think purrs for you and actually purrs for the way your neighbor whistles. Kaia watched my hand and Edda watched our faces and the Archive purred with visible pride because books know when they have stopped distracting and started counting again. The girl with the pen looked up once and I smiled at her like a man who never tries to be anyone\u2019s poem. She went back to her lines. She has better pursuits than my sentences.\n\nWhen we came back to air, the city had decided to pretend to be calm. That is often when cruelty feels most comfortable showing up with a basket of fruit. Vale\u2019s lieutenant, the one with the scar that had never put on enough lipstick to convince anyone it liked being looked at, did not arrive. The hole she left had the exact shape of effort. It shocked me that the Night would choose to take something as minor as a lieutenant when the city expected them to snatch something that glittered more. It then made sense, because petty kidnaps do better work than elegant ones when your goal is to teach the habit of fear. I have survived too long by reading their pettiness as devotion. I felt my jaw ache in places I do not enjoy remembering I own.\n\n\u201cDo not rush it,\u201d Ash said when I got as far as the door and stopped as if ropes had remembered me. \u201cThey took that woman because she is the kind who buys bread in five loaves and shares three and then teaches someone else how to make the other two last until Thursday. They will expect you to admire the courage of retribution and hurry into the spot where their trap can eat you on camera. In another hour they will decide whether to deference their own theft and make a speech about safety. We will preempt them. We will write the courtesy they crave and make it read like scorn.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow,\u201d Kaia said, not because she doubted, but because the question is our family recipe. \u201cWhere. When.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the quiet part of the river ward where tutelage lives in stairwells,\u201d Ash said, which is a very auntie way of saying by the school opposite the laundry where little boys learn to recycle laces. \u201cWe will convene a Parish Deference. It is not in the clauses. It is in the city. The bell will not be necessary because the kettle will do. The mouth will declare itself by saying good evening to twenty-three windows. The handless face will look because a child will hold up a broken clock. They took a woman who trains other people\u2019s breath. We will make them bring her back by making breath an expense they can\u2019t afford to waste today.\u201d\n\nWe spent an hour doing things that do not look like resistance and therefore matter. We sent a boy who keeps a list of spoons to tap on doors the exact number of times that makes polite look like code. We borrowed three chairs and called them pews so people who had not entered a church since the city stopped believing in that sort of devotions could feel at home. We told the dog that tonight, he would bark once, and only once, when the first vampire attended disguised as a rich woman. He practiced. He took it very seriously. We taught a kettle to wheeze at the right pitch. We asked Edda to send us a cord that looked like a ribbon so that if the Countess tried to be generous later we could make her feel late. We arranged oranges on a windowsill as if sorting prayers into edibles and left one mistaken on purpose because some mistakes are invitations.\n\nThe Parish Deference began where any good story does, with one old woman telling another to be quiet or be useful. The kettle announced itself. The mouths said good evening in a way that made the wall write down where it had been spoken. Children carried chairs with the solemnity of professional mourners at a wedding. The first petitioner was a man who has never not undercut his own height by apologizing for it, and we made him stand under a lintel that did not demand his head bow, and he learned something about pride that it can take a body forty years to remember it owns. The second was a woman who wanted to know if she could write her son\u2019s name where the Registry would normally write an inventory number, and we told her no, because his name is not a label, but yes, because the wall that holds the Parish Deference will take that name and keep it better than paper. The third was a child who asked if the bear liked plum jam, and we said only if the judge brings it.\n\nWe had not reached twenty-three when the Night arrived, and it did not arrive in silk. It arrived in sleeves rolled to the elbows and a look that wanted to be called weary by men who write editorials and prefer to pretend that violence is interrupting someone else\u2019s administration. The agent who had adjusted his cuffs at the yards now came without cuffs and with hands that held a hat too politely. He said he was there to listen. He stood where he could not help but hear. He waited for the word please and gave it the sort of attention men reserve for women with whose names they have decided to fall in love.\n\n\u201cWe want your lieutenant returned,\u201d I said, when he had tried listing to be decent and the Parish had been decent back at him. \u201cWe want her hands returned with her. We want an apology for wasting work. The city is tired of training. It would prefer to be trained.\u201d\n\nHe played the new game as if he hadn\u2019t practiced all morning. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said, and he meant it, because he cannot help but love rehearsals in which the other actor knows his lines. \u201cPlease accept that we have procedures. Please do not name individuals. Please return to the Forum tomorrow with an appropriate petition and we will\u2014\u201d\n\nKaia cut him off with the luxury she affords only people who have shown themselves unable to build their own tools. \u201cWe are the forum tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cThis wall remembers better than your slate. This kettle calls witnesses you do not own. The Observatory has assigned an eye to our street because a boy has decided to be rude with a clock he stole and we have decided to praise him for it. Bring me the woman with the cleft in her lip and the habit of sending children to bed with two kinds of stories, one about hunger and one about mathematics. Bring her without folding her into paperwork that will later make her think she was wrong to teach the difference.\u201d\n\nThe agent looked to where he thought his chalk line might connect him to Mire\u2019s listening. He found no chalk because the Aunties had swept, and he disliked how clean the doorway felt. He left because men like him prefer to promise rather than to be seen failing. We waited. We told three more stories and one long joke about bees in a jar that the dog ruined by barking at the wrong time because he wanted to be included. We practiced deference badly, which is the first correct version of any good habit. We lined our mouths with courtesy and used it to make insults taste like instructions. We refused to let anyone\u2019s eyes practice crying. After thirty minutes in which I learned how to stand without counting, they returned the lieutenant.\n\nShe walked like paper learning not to tear when folded. Her eyes were the opposite of wine. We did not cheer because cheering is what you do when someone wins a thing. We made room for her body. We put the chair that had pretended to be a pew under her hands so she could own something that had just learned how to be furniture. We did not ask questions in public and she did not answer any. Later, she and Ash would inventory the damages. Later, a bear would sit in a different room and lick a clerk\u2019s fingers clean of honey. For now the Parish gave her its breath by breathing in and not out until she remembered how to do the second part. If we have invented a better method for telling people they are welcome and expected to be difficult, I have not read it.\n\nWe let the Night watch us watching ourselves. The agent took off his hat and did not know what to do with it because the heads of men like him have learned to balance crowns that do not exist. He looked at me as if asking me to take a portion of his culpability and store it in a drawer he could pretend he did not own. I dislike drawers. I nodded as if I had promised to consider it. There will come a day when he is useful. I will let it hurt him.\n\nAfterward, when the oranges were eaten by accident and on purpose and the chairs returned to the parts of rooms that had missed them, Kaia and I walked the long way home because the braid had decided that if it was not made to carry a speech it would be content to carry the quiet. The handless face looked toward us without moving. We passed the Bridge that Isn\u2019t and did not flatter it with an explanation. A woman in a window shook a rug into the evening and made the dust look like a ceremony to which someone had forgotten to send invitations. Sevrin\u2019s junior trailed with the efficient attention of someone whose body has learned to be furniture and wants promotion. The dog ran ahead to chase nothing because sometimes you need to relieve the evening of all its dignity.\n\n\u201cI will teach you hinges,\u201d I told Kaia because fathers born too late are forced to speak in metaphors to feel less guilty about absence. \u201cThe kind that pretend to be decoration and hold doors honest. The kind that squeak at a particular note when the wrong person attempts to make them behave. The kind that turn a drawer into a letter and a letter into a room. My mother taught me nothing about bread, but she taught me to listen to the way a cupboard gives way when it is tired of holding secrets.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know those hinges,\u201d she said, without cruelty, because the best way to forgive a man is to let him imagine he is teaching you. \u201cI want the ones that fold time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ones that fold time require a boy with a bell and a woman with a handkerchief who does not apologize for it,\u201d I said. \u201cWe will borrow them. You will steal them. You will not let your aunt put them by the stove where the heat will undo the cleverness. We will make the city do origami so good that even the vampires admire the crease.\u201d\n\nWe climbed the stairs to the door that lies and, inside, the kitchen had done us the service of becoming boring. The table was a table and not a map. The kettle was an instrument and not a witness. The matches were simply wood waiting for rough treatment that would make them useful. Ash had fallen asleep in her chair with her head on her arm and her hand curled around the tin so that even her dreams could not be trusted not to protect us. The lieutenant had a quilt across her knees and a smear of honey on her upper lip that she had not noticed and would, later, find indecent enough to make her laugh until the dog corrected her for forgetting to pat him.\n\nI set the handless shard on the windowsill beside the orange and a new object that might have been a gear or a bribe or a joke. I did not say I was grateful because gratitude is loud and people were sleeping. I allowed my back to have ideas about chairs. The braid purred like an animal discovering its own stupid capacity for affection. The city turned in its sleep and did not bite. And when the bell chose to ring again, from far away where a boy had decided luck was not an animal you could train but a gate you could oil until it swung for anyone, I did not stand. I lay my hand flat on the table to feel the grain remember it had been trees, and I called that jurisprudence for the day because the law had eaten too much honey to ruin it with words.",

                              "content": "They rang the midnight bell with broken knuckles so that it sounded like a man trying not to cry. We had to listen. Everyone in the city did, even those who slept underground and the ones who pretended not to care. Sound does strange things when the cobbles are slick and the air is arguing with itself. It gets into seams and screws and folds you didn't know you had. It collects.\n\nI stood beneath the colonnade of the Observatory, watching the bell's bronze throat swing through the low clouds, and tried to imagine what the city would look like if it ever unplugged itself from the moon. You can make a city forget the sun if you work slowly enough. They had. The Night Registry\u2014our good Masters\u2014kept us in the long dusk; a liturgy of curfews and gentle veils and a clever, constant throb of newsreels about voluntary cooperation. Vampires only like certainty, which in this case means they write the rules and we sign them in our blood.\n\nI knew the rules better than most. I wrote part of them. Not the words\u2014the binding. My job was to stitch the spells into the law so neatly that you couldn\u2019t tug at a thread without gnawing your own fingers off. We call it jurisprudence and call ourselves wizards so we can sleep.\n\n\u201cMaster Kade,\u201d said the clerk who had come to fetch me. Hers was a voice that trembled but did not break. \u201cThe Exsanguinary Conveners are waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am here,\u201d I said, which was technically true. Sometimes that comforted people. Sometimes it only comforted me.\n\nThey had convened in the Apse of the Clock, which had never been a church but always pretended to be. The walls were black marble streaked with a mineral that caught light like the underside of a raven\u2019s wing. Closest thing to a sunrise we had now. Above the dais, the huge, nonfunctional clock face stared out with no hands, no numerals, just an emptiness where time had once been allowed to happen. It had a presence like a wound in a statue.\n\nThey sat in a half-circle: Archon Mire, whose mouth was always a secret carved too carefully; Sevrin in gray silk; the Countess of Sugared Bones, who was younger than the others by two centuries and tried not to show it; a pair of junior nocturnals who took notes in a shorthand that reminded me of teeth marks. There were others, lurking. There always were.\n\nI bowed and did not lower my eyes. You can look vampires in the eye if they\u2019ve invited you; otherwise it\u2019s like stepping onto a railway and hoping the train is polite.\n\n\u201cKade,\u201d said Mire, his voice the old stone of a cistern. \u201cOne of ours dies at sunrise.\u201d\n\nI didn't correct him. They didn\u2019t do slips, nor metaphors, nor any fun. They were telling me something; it was my job to deduce which thing. \u201cWhose sunrise?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had those around here for a while.\u201d\n\nSevrin smiled without showing teeth. \u201cA figurative one. Which would become literal if\u2026 remedial actions are not undertaken. We are not disposed to let it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemedial actions,\u201d I said, as if tasting the words might explain them. \u201cYou have a fever and you want me to draw your blood.\u201d\n\nThe Countess laughed once, small and bright. It died on the black marble.\n\n\u201cGeneral Tomas Vale,\u201d said Mire. He put the name into the room like a knife placed on a table. Marine steel, careful engraving, meant for use. \u201cHe speaks tomorrow at the river amphitheater. No one attends such events without our consent, as you know, and yet this\u2014this pageant of dawn\u2014has collected more than tolerable noise. There are pamphlets. Chants. People behaving as though they had opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s honorable,\u201d I said without thinking. An error. The junior nocturnals stopped writing for one heartbeat. Sevrin\u2019s smile cooled.\n\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Mire said. \u201cHe believes in some code, and that code has made him unpredictable. We had an understanding with him, once. A balance. But he has declared the old tithes unconscionable and encourages disobedience in those we\u2026 govern. He is no longer useful alive. It would be gory to simply remove him onstage. Too visible. We require deniability. We require a mechanism. We require you.\u201d\n\nHe reached into his coat and laid a small glass phial beside the knife-name. Thick red liquid clung to the sides; when it slid, it did not care about gravity.\n\n\u201cYou want a geas,\u201d I said. \u201cBlood-anchored and time-locked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want him to die by the turning of a wheel he cannot see,\u201d Sevrin said. \u201cA wheel that touches him only because it must. We want the wheel in your hands.\u201d\n\nI could have said no. There are always choices. Some of them are only offered to see if you still remember that word.\n\nI don\u2019t remember sitting. My body knows the Protocol when the Protocol is near. Some old script lit up behind my teeth, an itch like a candle wanting to be snuffed. The phial pulsed. I had done this before. Not on someone decent. Not by this method.\n\n\u201cWhat is the anchor?\u201d I asked. My mouth had gone dry and my hands had decided to be very still. \u201cIt must share breath with him. Blood or hearth. A name he cannot remove.\u201d\n\nSevrin pushed a second object across the black glass: a picture, glossy and warm from a pocket. He did it without any counterfeit of pleasure. Vampires don\u2019t like to pretend to be happy. They consider it undignified.\n\nShe had my eyes.\n\nNo, that was a lie. She had the eyes I had always found in mirrors when I carelessly expected to see my father. People tell themselves the wrong stories to make the world line up. But the tilt of the mouth, that stubborn slant of the shoulders as if the air was meant to be pushed aside\u2014those were mine. And the hair, which refused to be persuaded by comb or knife.\n\n\u201cKaia,\u201d I said, and the name was a dropped glass smoking itself out on the floor.\n\n\u201cYour daughter,\u201d said Mire. \u201cRaised outside the Registry\u2019s parameters. Unregistered. Clever. A... repairer of old machines and dead radios. If we were told the truth.\u201d He looked at Sevrin. \u201cWere we?\u201d\n\nSevrin nodded once. \u201cMostly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe has been in the company of General Vale\u2019s circle for some months,\u201d continued Mire as if we were discussing weather. \u201cThey believe she can wire sound into miracles. She designed the amplification array he will use tomorrow. Did you know that she climbs the old cranes at the docks as if there were stairs?\u201d\n\nI did know. I could not say how I knew without telling them about the nights I stood at the edge of the salvage yard and listened for her laugh, the way some people look up at apartment windows out of habit, not hope. I could not. I breathed, and the air had been filed down.\n\n\u201cShe is his anchor, then,\u201d I said, and made the sentence as taut as a guitar string you are scared to pluck. \u201cYou are offering me the blood that binds him to his stage, and the spell runs through that binding. He dies when she does.\u201d\n\nThe room didn\u2019t tilt. It didn\u2019t need to. The world has very good balance, until you push it.\n\nSevrin moved the phial a centimeter toward me. \u201cThe geas requires, to operate as intended: two names, three equal breaths, one witness, and a single act.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are insane.\u201d That was not what I\u2019d meant to say. I meant to recite the statutes, to show them the piece of the law where this couldn\u2019t be done, to find an out in the baroque network of their own rules. But the rules always contain a rule about themselves. The rules teach you how to lose. \u201cNo consent, no\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou signed the oath,\u201d said Mire softly. \u201cIn that room with no windows. You tasted the silver leaf. You consented to use any instruments necessary to keep the peace of the Night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not keep the peace with my daughter\u2019s pulse,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou kept it with other people\u2019s pulses for twenty years,\u201d said the Countess very gently. \u201cIt is not odd that the measure circles back.\u201d\n\nThey had planned this and they were enjoying parts of it. But not all. Mire\u2019s fingers were steady on the phial; Sevrin\u2019s were not. They, too, disliked unpredictability. I was very unpredictable.\n\n\u201cI left her for this,\u201d I said. It was a confession or a curse. \u201cSo that she would not have to know any of this. So that she would not be a door you could open with my name. I made it very clear to whoever was listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife is full of doors,\u201d said Sevrin. \u201cDo not make the mistake of believing there are only the ones you see.\u201d\n\nI was already making calculations. Hypothetical trajectories you could step into like alleys. If I took the job, the geas would coil around my bones and make them ring when I tried to walk a different way. If I refused, they would do it themselves. They would find someone else and also, as a matter of principle and pedagogy, make me watch. Vampires understand drama. They stage their lessons for an audience of one.\n\nKaia. Visible and whole as she had been the last time I saw her, at a distance, her hand on a rusted-out crane like a conductor resting fingers on an instrument before beginning. She had taken her mother\u2019s name. She had made a life that did not require mine to be true. She was the best thing I had done and the worst. I did not think that was unusual for fathers.\n\n\u201cWhat do you gain killing Vale this way?\u201d I asked without quite moving my mouth. \u201cIt is not your style. You make people disappear into tidy boxes with seals no one can break. You do not hang the dawn around a child\u2019s throat and call it jewelry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDramaturgy,\u201d said the Countess. \u201cIf a saint dies for someone\u2019s sins, the crowd sees how heavy the sins must be. They will recoil. Vale will be the one who kills her. Not us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruth is a tool,\u201d said Mire. \u201cCivility is a costume. We cannot keep either if people like Vale insist on running about naked.\u201d\n\nI stood up. Sat down. That was not how bodies work but it was what happened. My breath came in precise increments; I would later remember to be grateful for the precision. That is always when I count\u2014the edges of things. I looked at the picture again, though I didn\u2019t want to. Kaia sat cross-legged on a railing with a coil of copper wire around her neck like a scarf. She had painted her nails black and smudged the polish by touching something before it was dry. Careless, careful child.\n\n\u201cI will not do this,\u201d I said, and felt a bone in my throat crack.\n\n\u201cDo not mistake your role,\u201d Mire said, and the air cooled by a small but definable measure. \u201cYour role does not ask whether. It asks how. It rewards skill.\u201d\n\nHe tipped the phial and the liquid made no sound against glass. It was too thick. It moved with intent. That was what made it binding.\n\n\u201cI am that child\u2019s father,\u201d I said, and last words looked for my tongue and did not find it.\n\n\u201cYou are what we made you,\u201d said Mire.\n\nTime did a trick like folding napkins. The protocols woke and I could feel them in the hollows of my wrists. The itch moved higher, into the jaw hinge, into the behind of the eyes. The world kept perfect time; the clock without hands laughed at me.\n\n\u201cWho told you where she is?\u201d I asked.\n\nSevrin\u2019s eyelids lowered, a small dent in a smooth thing. \u201cShe is not a careful fugitive. Careless & careful. You know this. The resistance is full of people who assume their nobility will be sufficient to confound the necessary. They do not know yet, Kade. They are still people who can gawk at an auditorium and believe they are in a temple. They still glow when they use words like justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cJustice is a word that does not belong to you,\u201d I said.\n\nHe looked weary. I almost pitied him. \u201cNor to you anymore, old friend.\u201d\n\nThe word friend caught in my teeth like a splinter of bone. He and I had played chess for years in rooms that smelled of ink and dust and the shy sweat of acolytes carrying armfuls of doctrine. He had introduced me to the taste of ferrisweet\u2014apple slices soaked in iron water to school the tongue away from sugar. He had brought salty dried plums to Kaia once, when she was small and impressionable and assumed every adult who looked at her kindly was a field she could plant a flag in. She had called him Uncle Sevrin.\n\nI think\u2014if you boil the world long enough things float to the surface. Sevrin\u2019s face floated now and I saw not a vampire\u2019s patient blankness but the man he had been two hundred years ago, when someone had decided to fetch him from death and dress him in a finer one. He had brought me into this work because he believed I could do math without lying. Irony was going to chew his throat to ribbon one night and he would thank it for the lesson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I said, because there were only two choices and this one would allow me to redraw the map while pretending to follow it.\n\nThe phial warmed in my hand. It felt like holding a wintering bird. It drenched my palm with a heat that did not pass into me. It didn\u2019t want to. A subtle contempt. The geas would use me and it would deny me.\n\nThey led me to the side chamber with no doors and a single drain in the middle of the floor. Such rooms are all alike. You can identify a government by its drains.\n\nSevrin stood with me and the Countess watched from the threshold. Mire did not enter. He disliked viscera and spells because he disliked all forms of mess that could not be cataloged; blood has too much imagination.\n\n\u201cI will be careful with the breath-count,\u201d Sevrin said softly. \u201cYou always insisted we do it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should not be here,\u201d I told him. \u201cThis is mine. Regardless of what comes after.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been here for so many things that did not belong to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be here now. Call it\u2014penance.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t believe in penance. He believed in consequences. That was different. I nodded to him anyway.\n\nWe said Kaia\u2019s name. The first breath condenses the world. The second convinces it. The third cuts.\n\n\u201cYour hands are shaking,\u201d the Countess said to Sevrin, but it was a performative whisper. She wanted me to hear.\n\n\u201cThe city is cold,\u201d he said, and in that, at least, we all agreed.\n\nI added Vale\u2019s name. I stitched it into the binding just so, you see, at just such an angle, a twist here, a loop there. A name is not a word; it is a map. I misdrew it\u2014no, that is not the word. I redrew it. I drew a map that included an alley and a door and a staircase only I could see. I did this not with my hands but with the part of me that never coughs or trembles. The shining, precise part that is only ever sure.\n\nWhen you have done this work for so long that you smell like laws in your sleeping hair, you learn to leave yourself lockpicks. You learn to encrypt your shame.\n\nIt cost me. I could feel the cost with every syllable, like a nail hammered into a heel. I coughed and coughed until something ragged came up and lay cupped beneath my tongue like a coin. Sevrin steadied me with fingers on my elbow; that old kindness again.\n\n\u201cWe are done,\u201d I said, and the word done was mud. \u201cThe binding is set. It will run if\u2014it will run.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look ill,\u201d the Countess said, and she was right. I had sweated through my shirt and the air in the doorless room caught on me the way a skater\u2019s hand catches on a crack in the ice. My ribs hurt. I should not have ribs. It is a nonsense thought we all have the first time something important breaks.\n\n\u201cEscort him home,\u201d Mire called from beyond the threshold in the voice of someone who has been told about results and does not want to be told about procedure. \u201cWatch him breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can walk,\u201d I said.\n\nSevrin didn\u2019t contradict me. He simply arranged his arm so that I could find it if I forgot how to keep my feet going the same way as each other.\n\nOutside, the bell had stopped. The city hummed like a mouthful of bees. Fog crawled through the alleys very politely. We were mid-block on Varick, just to the left of the old Leviathan bridge, when Sevrin said, without turning his head, \u201cThen what now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d I said. My voice sounded like a voice thrown into a well that did not return it as kindly as one would hope. \u201cNow I sleep awhile. Then I go and I watch a speech. Then I find an alley that was not on any of your maps.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not try,\u201d he said. It was almost a plea. \u201cI have seen you in courtrooms. You think you can lawyer the universe. But there are some words that cannot be persuaded not to mean what they do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just taught me that if I do not try I will not be able to sleep, ever,\u201d I said. \u201cLet me have at least the possibility of failure. You owe me that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI owe you nothing,\u201d he said, and then he sighed. \u201cI owe her, perhaps. For the plums.\u201d\n\nI stopped at the door to my rooms. It\u2019s ordinary, for someone who has made the inside of the world his workplace, to keep the outside plain. A set of three pegs for three coats, though I only ever wore one. A plant with leaves that have learned to shine by rubbing themselves against the window because we do not have enough light. Books carved into the wall. A kettle that takes forever.\n\nWithin, I took off the shirt that clung and threw it into a corner. In the mirror I did not look at myself because I can only ever do that on purpose. The left arm had a thread of red down to the wrist in imitation of blood. The word imitation made me smile and then not smile. The phial on my table had left a ring of something that was not condensation. My mouth tasted like rust.\n\nI took out the hidden things. A small tin filled with nails half polished, half still wearing their ship-rot. A deck of cards with three kings missing and the king of hearts replaced with a bad pen drawing of a crow. A coin that had no country. I have learned to trust objects that forget their inscriptions. I took out, lastly, the small piece of mirror I had cut from the big one to see if the small one would tell me kinder stories.\n\nI set the shard on edge and I said my true name. Not the one they used. The one that isn\u2019t in any of their files because I never wrote it down. My mouth opened and closed on it. It did not like to be said. There is a fine line between a spell and a confession.\n\nSomething woke behind my ribs. It liked being woken. It liked the math of light bouncing back in clean angles. It liked the idea of a world that could be resolved into integers. I took the needle from the drawer and I pricked my finger. Red gathered and was very shy about leaving home. It did though, finally. It hesitated like a friend in a doorway and then joined the air.\n\nIt is a small trick to count breaths and trick your body into thinking you are asleep when you are not. Wizards learn it early. Men who have lost their children learn it in a different way. I did both.\n\nI saw her, the first time, beneath the old train bridge where the weeds were metal. She walked like a person at home in ruins. Some people make ruins feel they have failed to frighten. She was talking to someone whose name I did not catch because of the whine of a defective streetlamp. I leaned on a railing and rehearsed the words I would never say. I do not forgive myself for this. There are things I have done that can be sorted into keep and burn and things that have to be filed under are you still a good person. This is in that last category.\n\nAt dawn\u2014I use the word because it is shorter than the truth\u2014we rose with the city. Everyone pretends they do not wake at the same time but we do. Kettles cry, boots find feet, arms reach for sleeves with the tiny fury of trying to convince cloth to be a second skin. The streets filled with a slow-moving density, no one sure whether this would be a day for errands or a day for scenes. The amphitheater by the river had been built from the skeleton of a collapsed library. People liked to say they could still hear pages turning when they sat there. They could not.\n\nGeneral Vale had the look of a man who had decided there were worse things than looking tired in public. His hair had been shaved close for convenience, not for effect. His suit fit well but not too well. He stood with his weight equally carried by both legs. People notice these things. They trust a man whose shoes match his gait.\n\nKaia stood behind him, on a platform cobbled together from door frames and stubbornness. She wore her work. Her hands were stamped black with oil the way some women used to darken their eyelashes to make them speak. She poured herself into a panel of switches like a prayer. She looked, briefly, toward the left side of the amphitheater where the old statue of a horse\u2019s head had lost its ears. She always checked landmarks as if they were old friends who could wander off. Her hair had been pulled back with a strip of red cloth that might once have been a uniform. She had not painted her nails this time.\n\nI stood among the crowd and shaped my body to be a person you brush past and forget. I was very good at this. It is useful to be ordinary if you want to commit extraordinary acts without interruption.\n\n\u201cCitizens,\u201d said Vale. He did not have to say citizens but he did and something in the crowd softened. People like the better versions of themselves even when they are called by names they are not allowed to own. \u201cWe were told we could share this city if we learned to be quiet. We were told to make ourselves easy to live with. We did. We have done very well at being easy. And yet we are asked for more. For the smoothness of our necks, for the slow narrowing of our bloodlines, for the patient surrender of our books and our songs and our right to weep. We have been gentle because we were told gentleness is survival.\u201d\n\nHe paused. It takes skill to pause without losing the rope you are climbing. He had that skill. Kaia leaned her shoulder against the panel briefly and looked up at something we could not see. She would never admit to prayer. That did not mean she did not do it.\n\n\u201cWe have been taught to fear the names of the people who feed on us,\u201d Vale continued, each word notched\u2014measureless. \u201cBut I am too old now to be afraid of a name, and I am old enough to remember a different way of speaking. They are not lords. They are not masters. They are not what they pretend.\u201d\n\nSomewhere in the crowd a woman sobbed once and stopped. It sounded like a cork finding a bottle.\n\n\u201cI am not asking you to burn,\u201d Vale said. \u201cI am asking you to step into the light you own.\u201d\n\nThe geas on my bones looked up sharply as if someone had called its name. It twitched inside me like a fish remembering an old river. It had three moments in which it could open and it preferred the second. I had built it that way. The opening would be a breath, a pause\u2014like the one Vale had just taken\u2014and then he would feel a sudden careful emptiness in his chest as if an organ had excused itself for a moment. He would look for a step and find none. He would sag, and the city would say the word: martyr. We had arranged it to look like an act of faith. Very tidy. Very us.\n\nI had also, in the dark while talking to someone who was no longer there, stitched in my map. And there it was\u2014the alley where the geas preferred to go if someone named it. You can hide a city within a sentence if you fold it right. I said the alley\u2019s name in a voice no one hears unless they were born underwater, and for a single precise instant the geas hesitated. I put a wedge in. It splintered. The sound was only audible to the part of me that never bleeds and never laughs. It was enough.\n\nKaia flinched. It could have been a gust. She looked toward the old horse\u2019s head again and then past it, past the river, past all of us, toward a place where the warehouses began to forget themselves. Her hand went to the red strip in her hair. She had been taught something by someone once: how to read the air. We never know which of our tricks will become our children\u2019s salvation. Or ours. She tugged the cloth once. It came free. A signal. I hope it was a signal. It felt like a signal.\n\nI stepped backward until my back found brick. I whispered into it. The brick whispered back. There is a lineage of alchemy that believes everything in the world agrees with everything else. People always meant it poetically. They had not made enough mistakes to see that sometimes the truth is unbearably literal. The brick and I made a deal. It would tell me when the geas moved in the mortar. I would not ask it to be anything other than brick. You should not ask a body to be more than it is when you are about to ask it to bear weight.\n\nVale\u2019s next word did not get said. In that, at least, I failed. He drew breath for it and the phrase shaped itself in the pad of his tongue and then stayed there, a cat refusing the door. He swayed. People thought it was passion. Some of them grabbed the stranger next to them, as people do when words tell them to. We are born with hands for a reason.\n\nKaia\u2019s fingers froze a centimeter over a switch. She had seen something no one else saw. She did not look at Vale. She looked at me.\n\nYou can combine familiarity with a face and the ache of other things and be wrong. But the eye knows. It is older than we are. She saw. I hid. I was the man behind the pillar by the vendor of burnt sugar nuts. I was ordinary. I was not in any of her stories and she recognized me anyway. Maybe not the name. Maybe just the outline under the skin.\n\nShe mouthed a word I could not read and then, very simply, she stepped off the platform.\n\nNot the long drop. She chose the short ladder. She chose the ground. People objected. She moved like water through a net.\n\nI followed the alley I had drawn and it let me in. It was a real alley when I had started, but the geas had invited it into a different kind of existence. The mortar tasted of iron, the way only an old city tastes. The brick told me where the binding had been anchored. It lay under the third step of the amplifier array. I had expected that. It wasn\u2019t what mattered.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Kaia said from behind me, and there she was. No oil now on her hands. She had wiped them on the red strip and the red strip hung from her fingers like a flag that did not want to be this kind of flag.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t?\u201d I said softly. \u201cI am making a career out of not-don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been dead for years,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always made your living while dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have breathed every day,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cAir doesn\u2019t mean alive,\u201d she said and tossed the red cloth to the ground. Her eyes were a brown that had been dipped in honey and coffee and left on a windowsill. \u201cThey sent you. The night. Of course they did. And you came because you always come when they whistle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came because they would have done it without me,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I am better at the crooked straight line.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou came because you want to pretend there\u2019s a rule about this that the right loophole will undo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou came because you think you can make the machinery of the world miscount. Which: yes. You can. I\u2019ve seen your prints on things you never touched. You came because\u2014\u201d\n\nShe stopped. She had looked at my hands.\n\n\u201cKade,\u201d she said, tasting the name with spite and something else. \u201cYour hands are too clean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not touch the phial,\u201d I said. \u201cMy friend held it. Does it matter where the stain is when the stain is everywhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I meant.\u201d She came closer rather than farther. She reached out and put her fingers very lightly on my wrist and the whole city fell quiet because of it. An absurd thought, but my brain will use any excuse to explain a big sensation. \u201cYou\u2019re too cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city is cold,\u201d I said, remembering Sevrin\u2019s line and hating it because today we were all quoting each other like a chorus.\n\nShe pressed inside my wrist with her thumb where the skin is thin and the story of the body normally tells itself. She did not find what she expected. Her eyes widened not with fear. With recognition. Some of us, when we repair old radios, learn the language of currents and contacts. We can tell the difference between a loop of living bioelectric nonsense and a hum that has been designed to forget itself.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOf course they would. Of course you would.\u201d She breathed once. \u201cWho made you? Who did I bury?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother did not bury me,\u201d I said, and my voice belonged to a different room, a different city. A different man. \u201cWe left before you were old enough to count in years. It is\u2026 complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything you say arrives with a fog machine and a stagehand,\u201d she said flatly. She did not move her thumb. She kept it on the mute place where, if I had been insisting on being the sort of creature I told everyone I was, there would have been a flutter telling her my heart had ideas. Ideas do not vibrate. They do not warm a wrist. \u201cAre you even my father?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d And after the rage had shouted its first syllable: \u201cHow.\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes. It was not brave. It was the only way I could keep my voice level. \u201cI know how to write a DNA poem,\u201d I said, because jokes sometimes keep terror from eating your feet. \u201cI am not metal all the way to the edges. I am a complicated object\u2014Kaia. They made me to make things. To stitch. To keep count. To be steady when other people shake. I did not know it at the beginning. They told me when it was useful. They forgot that things they make remember themselves.\u201d\n\nShe pulled her hand away. \u201cSo you can\u2019t even die properly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI die like anyone else if you take enough pieces,\u201d I said. \u201cI am not here to argue with you about God. I am here to take the geas and reshape it so it eats me instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t how\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not the only one who can make a dead radio speak,\u201d I said. \u201cWe all have languages. Mine is older than electricity and makes better jokes. I built a bend into it. If I step into that bend, it will snap in my direction. Vale will live to say his last line. You will stand on your platform and pretend to be angry at him about the volume until the people laugh with you. I will fall down like a man poisoned by his own spine. They will call it guilt or justice or an accident. Then I would like you to take the red cloth and leave before my friend has time to realize what alley I used.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. The rage came back and it had company. \u201cNo. You do not get to climb on a pyre and call it parenting. You do not get to be heroic in the middle and absent at the ends. You do not get to choose a death that lets you be decent in a story you wrote.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not decent,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I did not write this story. I am just the page they printed on because it was convenient.\u201d\n\nHer laugh was a paper cut. \u201cYou taught me everything I know about machining because I watched you, through windows you thought were fogged. You make the world with your hands and then you look down when it starts moving and declare it god. You are an engine pretending to be a book.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is good,\u201d I said, unable not to admire it. \u201cSay it at a crowd someday. They will like it. Do not say it to Vale. He reads too slowly.\u201d\n\nShe stepped back and looked at me as if I were a building she had to decide whether to trust. Then, with the economy characteristic of her best work, she said two sentences and saved time.\n\n\u201cIf you do this, I will never forgive you. If you don\u2019t, I will never forgive you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is fortunate,\u201d I said, \u201cthat your forgiveness has never been a condition of my love.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove,\u201d she said as if tasting an old sweet that had melted in the wrapper. \u201cYou\u2019re a machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you were an infant,\u201d I said, because I found myself unwilling to be ashamed of everything today. \u201cWe are all limited in our first forms.\u201d\n\nShe put the red cloth in my hand. It felt like a signal again, but a different one.\n\n\u201cThen let\u2019s rig it,\u201d she said curtly. \u201cShow me your alley. If I am going to be dragged into a myth I want to fix the props.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are late,\u201d she said, and she was right. The geas, like all programs with pride, used any pause to assert itself. I could feel it skating along bone, looking for the place my map was weakest.\n\nWe settled into the place by the third step where the binding had been taught to sleep. Kaia knelt and unscrewed a plate with a bit she pulled from behind her ear. She handed me two lengths of wire and did not explain what color was what; she knew I knew. The two of us crouched like thieves in a chapel, touching the world in the way only people who listen do. The air inside the machine tasted like a coin.\n\n\u201cOn three,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOn two,\u201d she said, and we did both. I have never felt more accurately understood.\n\nVale\u2019s word finally slid off his tongue and landed where it was supposed to. People caught it like a thrown ball. He took a breath and another. The geas opened its mouth. I stepped into it.\n\nIt is not easy to describe what it feels like to trick a spell into eating you. It is like convincing your own reflection to reach out and pick your pocket. It is like asking your bones to shift a little aside so you can be a different shape while remaining the same shape. It is like removing a wedding ring so that you can take off a glove. It is like\u2014it is like. It is like.\n\nI felt the bite. It was not dramatic. It was clean. A shut door. That is what death is most days. A shut door and the picture falling off the wall because of the draft.\n\nKaia caught my shoulder. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, reflexively, as people do when a glass falls. And then louder, with intent: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nShe had her mouth near my ear now and I remembered the first time she had spoken into my hair to tell me a secret that had no words. She was not tall. I am. These things matter when the body is failing politely.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t build it right,\u201d she said, and there was more pride than fear in her voice. \u201cYou refused to assume you would survive. You gave it no path for afterwards. That is sloppy.\u201d She traced something fast on my skin. It burned in a pattern that I recognized much later. She pressed. She turned. She forced the geas to stutter. She spoke its name with her hands. She bled onto it without cutting herself because that is something I taught her with spoons and screws and the long thin shards of a radio\u2019s spine.\n\n\u201cTake it,\u201d she said. \u201cTake it and lay it across your back like a plank. Be a bridge. Don\u2019t be a hole.\u201d\n\nThe oldest software in me\u2014sorry, the oldest magic\u2014rippled gratefully. You can always wake ancient things by speaking to them in brazen baby talk. It listened to Kaia because she spoke to it like a colleague. It shifted. It stopped eating my heart, which is not a heart but enough. It moved lower, it settled in the place where I have always known how to carry burdens. It hurt. It kept hurting. It would keep on hurting as long as I let it, as long as Vale drew breaths and used them for words. The bite had become a weight. We could work with weight.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll still die,\u201d I said through a throat that did not want me to.\n\n\u201cEveryone does,\u201d she said in an absurdly cheerful voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t get extra points for doing it onstage. Now, go. Get to the place where the Bridge That Isn\u2019t shows its hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I am found,\u201d I said, \u201cthey will hurt you to teach me not to be found.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always hurt someone,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think I have not been living here too? Go.\u201d\n\nI went. I tucked the red strip of cloth into my collar because I wanted it to smell like smoke and her hair. The alley widened and became a street like any other. Vale had resumed speaking into the sky as if speaking were a way to do things and not just the thing itself. People lifted their faces so his words could fall on them and wash their eyes.\n\nOn the way to the Bridge That Isn\u2019t there is a door with a sign that says Always Closed. It is always closed. Behind it is a stair that goes down into a room that is sometimes a kitchen and sometimes a sea cave and sometimes a train platform at three in the morning when the lights work. I used to sit there with Sevrin and think we were the only ones who knew where the door went. I used to be that kind of stupid.\n\nAt the bottom of the stair now there was a person. She leaned against the pillar with a look that suggested pillars should be grateful. The person could have been the Countess if she were bad at makeup and good at not caring. She could have been someone else entirely. She smiled without teeth and held out both hands like a rabbi and an assassin.\n\n\u201cKade,\u201d she said. \u201cYou did not come to see me when you arrived in the city. I am taking it personally.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone tells me I have been doing this wrong,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou write the law,\u201d she replied, \u201cand you pretend to follow it. You come to me when you need a change of costume.\u201d\n\nI knew her name in three different languages and none matter. The underground calls her Ash. The Registry calls her Laurel. The children in the yards call her Auntie Knife and ask her to tell the story about the bear who moved into the courthouse and made the judges carry honey for him in their hats. She uses all of her names and none.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I said. The weight on my back pulsed. It had learned to measure its own movement and was not delighted by the results. \u201cI need to walk under a different sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone does,\u201d she said. \u201cShow me the bruise.\u201d\n\nI showed it. She put her ear to my chest and listened and her mouth twisted when she did not hear what she expected. \u201cWell, well. That answers a bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not have time\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDearest,\u201d she said, and somehow the word was not condescension, \u201ctime is all we have. Even if there is none. You taught me that. Sit.\u201d\n\nI sat. She ran her fingers along the seams of my ribs and looked very, very thoughtful. She hummed. She bit the inside of her cheek. She muttered in a language that had fewer vowels than ours. \u201cI can take it off you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it will take the rest with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need the rest to stand,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen I can move it,\u201d she said. \u201cI can put it somewhere no one thinks to look. It will still hurt. It will confuse the people who planted it there, which is my favorite thing. It will give you\u2014\u201d She tilted her head. \u201c\u2014two hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen you fall down,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you may choose when.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d I said.\n\nShe braided my breath. That is the simplest way to tell it. She took handfuls of the air inside me and wove them together with something older and thinner and stronger than hair. She pulled. She shoved. She used the heels of her hands to push the weight where it did not want to go. She sang a bad little song about a woman trying to get a mattress up a narrow stair and I wanted to laugh and couldn\u2019t because my chest was not my own. And then it was over and I could stand again, although my legs had opinions about it.\n\n\u201cRun along,\u201d she said, and slapped my shoulder like an aunt. \u201cTell your honorable man he owes me a favor. Tell your daughter to stop using red ties, they make her too obvious. Tell the Night that when they come to collect they should bring better bags.\u201d\n\nI put my hand on her arm and said the thank you a person says to someone who has just convinced them not to die quite yet and she shrugged it off and pretended to fix my collar instead. That is the living for you.\n\nBack into the lightless light. The river had begun to practice being a mirror. The amphitheater was five minutes away if you had your breath and more if you did not. I moved through the crowd like water through metal. People make way for a man with a certain sort of face and it is not fair but today it was helpful. I think it is something about guilt\u2014it smells like rain to some noses.\n\nOnstage, Vale lifted his hand in a gesture that was going to find its way onto etchings and the inside of cheap rings if we did not stop it. Kaia had resumed her place. She did not look at me. She looked at the city, which is better.\n\n\u201cAnd so,\u201d Vale said, and the geas on my back sank little teeth in and I did not fall because the braid held, \u201cwe can begin to be difficult. We can begin to ask for receipts, as the old aunties say. We can begin to refuse to wear costumes that make us kind to monsters.\u201d\n\nThe laughter that rose was unplanned and therefore sacred. People recognized themselves in it. It had the sound of so many pots laid down at last.\n\nThe Night would come for this. They would come quietly and prettily and write checks the size of buildings. They would hire language to do their lifting. They would offer rueful grins to the cameras. They would arrest no one we noticed and everyone we did not. They would make parents teach children how to shut up without saying it.\n\nThey would also come for me.\n\n\u201cSevrin!\u201d I shouted into a future that was about to become present. I do not know why I called him. I do. Of course I do. I wanted a friend. Or I wanted to remind myself I had once had one.\n\nWhen the Night\u2019s agents moved, they moved like ink looking for an edge to ruin. I felt them before I saw them. There is an old part of me that detects pressure changes in rooms and pressure changes in plans. They came. They did not wear uniforms. They wore the air. The braid at my back murmured that time was shorter than we wanted to believe. Kaia lifted her chin and her mouth found a shape I had seen once when she was twelve and the woman at the bread stall had told her she could not have the stale loaf because the rules were for everyone. The shape meant: Try me.\n\nI had set a geas and stepped into it. I had redrawn a map and walked it. I had handed a piece of my breath to a woman who kept knives in her laugh. I had hurt someone I loved and made it useful. I had told the truth badly. There is only so much one man can do before the bell rings again.\n\nIt rang. But not the bell I expected. This one was a bicycle bell, tinny and brave. It came from the top of the amphitheater where a boy of nine sat on the saddle of a contraption he had probably not built himself and rang and rang and rang because someone had told him ringing bells brings luck and he had decided to believe it. It saved no one and saved everyone.\n\nVale finished his sentence. The crowd did not break. The Night\u2019s ink found too many edges. The amphitheater held.\n\nWhen Sevrin arrived he was breathless, which told me nothing useful except that he had chosen to run rather than to glide. He found me because he always does. He put his hand on my arm and he did not say anything and then he did.\n\n\u201cYou cannot keep doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot write your way out of every wall we build.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should build better walls,\u201d I said, and spared him a smile he had known when we still believed in different kinds of time.\n\nHis eyes slid to my collarbone. The red strip of cloth lay there like a notary\u2019s stamp. He looked past me and saw Kaia and something cracked in his face and it did not put itself back. \u201cShe found you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe did,\u201d I said. \u201cYou cannot stop people from finding what you leave in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never tried,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was your hobby.\u201d\n\nHe looked older and then he looked at the clock with no hands and then he said, very quietly, \u201cWe are out of grace. I cannot protect you from this. I can only make a shape around it so that it looks nicer as it ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake me a cup,\u201d I said. \u201cI am thirsty.\u201d\n\nHe did not laugh. He had stopped laughing. He lifted a hand, very small, and the Night around us arranged their faces. He could not unring bells. He could not unname a geas. He could not do much more than stand with me while I paid for the alley. Sometimes that is all friendship gets to be.\n\n\u201cTwo hours,\u201d Ash had said. Already the braid was fraying where I carried it. Vale\u2019s last words were finding him. The city had begun to sharpen its teeth on hope. The Night had bared their own. Between them there is a line you cannot see until it is too late to step over. I had stepped over. Kaia had jumped. Sevrin had been placed.\n\nI reached for my daughter with my eyes and she met them because now she could and there was not time for more than the shape of a nod. The red cloth warmed on my skin as if it were alive. The Night opened their mouths and showed me the absence inside. My back bent under the bite that was a weight now, only a weight, only a bridge.\n\nThey do not like bridges. Vampires prefer tunnels. It is harder to own what lets other people cross.\n\n\u201cDo you have any last requests?\u201d Sevrin asked, which was not a joke and not exactly not one.\n\n\u201cBring plums to the children,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd teach them to spit the pits at your door.\u201d\n\nHe bowed, and for a moment he, too, looked like a man and not a rule.\n\nSomewhere inside my chest a small very old machine ticked once\u2014just once\u2014and then went still, as if it wanted to be sure I noticed it noticing me. It is a strange thing to know you are constructed and know you can still be ruined. It is stranger to realize both truths make you alive.\n\nThe bell began to ring again. Or perhaps it was only in my head. It did not matter. I lifted my hands. I was ready to be very difficult indeed.",

I took mine, counted it twice because the braid at my back liked it better that way, and raised my voice like a flag you can\u2019t legally forbid. There are clauses written for the days the city remembers itself. We tucked them under satin words in volumes no one checks because governments do not expect the living to memorize footnotes. I had written that footnote eighteen years ago as a joke with iron filings in it. If a bell rings in the presence of a public declaration and there are more than five witnesses and the Clock that has no hands can see the speaker\u2019s mouth, the Night must accept the Open Forum and halt overt enforcement for thirteen minutes and thirteen heartbeats. The bell had rung. The declaration had declared. The witnesses spilled over the seats like water over a lip. And even a clock without hands can stare.\n\n\u201cOpen Forum,\u201d I said, and I did not shout. Good law does not need volume; it needs naming. \u201cUnder the Truces of Long Dusk, Section Six, Article Nocturne, governing Assemblies of Concern. I cite the bell and the mouths and the empty face that remembers time. I name Archon Mire. I name the Countess of Sugared Bones. I name Sevrin, who knows the pages by taste. I name the Night Registry as a body. You will stand down for the duration.\u201d\n\nSevrin\u2019s head turned halfway, like a man listening for his own footstep on a stair. The agents who wore the air paused, which is as much as you can expect when you\u2019re binding the people who think binding is something that happens to other animals. People around me did not know they had heard a law until the pause arrived and set itself at their feet like a cat waiting to be admired from a respectful distance. Mire\u2019s voice came from nowhere and everywhere in the way power prefers; it scraped, very faintly, on the inside of my teeth.\n\n\u201cThirteen minutes,\u201d he said, because he kept his own copy of the Truces and had underlined the parts that made him nervous. \u201cAnd thirteen heartbeats. Do not pretend you will keep them tidy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the point,\u201d I said. \u201cTidiness is your hobby. Mine is the law.\u201d\n\nThe amphitheater exhaled as if it had been holding a breath none of us could afford. Vale did not squander it. He looked up as if receiving instruction from a bird and then did the simplest thing: he thanked the bell. That is a very old trick. Thank something that made a good noise at the right time. It makes the rest of the noises want to behave.\n\nKaia had the panel under her hands and the panel understood it was being handled by someone for whom the world was not a puzzle but a workshop. She did not look at me again. She used the thirteen minutes like a woman can use the last of the butter before payday to make a pan taste like childhood. She poured Vale into the city in a way microphones were not supposed to do. She lifted a frequency just a fraction, the way you lift a child to see over the rail, and the words traveled better. We have always been a city of carries\u2014bridges between the places someone tried to sever. I felt the weight on my back negotiate with the new current. It decided, temporarily, that being a bridge could be a vocation rather than a punishment.\n\n\u201cSay the vow,\u201d I called, not to Vale, but to the doctrine. \u201cPut what you are doing somewhere even they agree not to step on.\u201d\n\nVale met my eye for the first time. He saw a man carrying something and did not ask if he could help because he was busy and because he is not a liar. He nodded in that short military way and lifted his right hand and then he used words that had been written when the city still believed daylight was a right. He vowed that any act taken against people gathered in intended peace within sight of the Observatory and the Clock would be answered not with knives but with names repeated daily until names wore a path in stone. It was a vow designed by monks who understood bureaucracy. If you want to make vampires uncomfortable, make them imagine the length of a list they do not control.\n\nSevrin\u2019s mouth twisted. I had known him long enough to see the exact beat where he weighed the worth of interrupting a vow versus the cost of being witnessed interrupting it. He let it stand because letting it stand permitted elegance later, and he is a collector of elegant later. The Countess, wherever she was smiling without her teeth, would have approved. If you are going to fall, you might as well make a shape of it the children can trace on their desks.\n\nThe thirteen minutes did not hoard themselves. They ran. I have never loved time more than when it shows you how ordinary running looks when it wears a cloak and pretends to be dignified. Vale went through his points, and they were points you could have guessed: tithes, blood-rights, lineages clipping themselves obediently, the soft murder of songs, the price of being polite. Nothing there is news unless news has always meant a rope you hand to the next climber. He did the clever thing at the end of the thirteen that was his and thirteen heartbeats that were not: he stopped where you expect a crescendo. He left the note in his throat. He let the crowd sing it with their mouths closed.\n\nThen the ink moved again. They could not help it. Polite predators still have to taste. The air\u2019s pressure changed. Kaia flicked a switch with her knuckle because she does not believe in letting electricity be lonely. I shifted my feet so my spine could carry better. If a bridge creaks, that\u2019s honesty, not failure.\n\n\u201cParole,\u201d I said to Sevrin, who had come to stand close enough that our shoulders could have remembered chess if they had been those kinds of shoulders. \u201cYou will give him parole to leave this place with his skin unpunctured. You will give her\u201d\u2014and here I tilted my head toward Kaia with the same small movement Sevrin had used moments before\u2014\u201csafe conduct under veil and public witness to a place I will name. You will tie the two to the same paper so you cannot forget one and remember the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder what authority,\u201d he said very gently, because he always taught me with pokes, \u201cdo you request this paper in the middle of a theater while a man purports to be sunlight?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the same that gives you the right to demand my breath,\u201d I said. \u201cUnder the oath I took and the oath you hold over me and the clause about acts taken in the open becoming part of the Archive. If you do not write the parole I demand, I will write an intercalation into the Clock and the next time you blink the city will insert a day between this dusk and the next and you will have to explain to your elders why everyone suddenly remembers morning.\u201d\n\nHe did not laugh. You do not laugh when someone mentions intercalation unless you are a historian or a murderer. He looked at the blank face above the stage, and I saw his pupils tighten as if the present had moved closer to his eye without asking permission.\n\n\u201cYou cannot,\u201d he said, for form, and not because he believed it.\n\n\u201cI stitched the handless place in the face,\u201d I said. \u201cI left myself a pocket. I lined it with a rule. Don\u2019t insult me and pretend I\u2019m threatening you with clouds.\u201d\n\nHe considered how much of this conversation would be recorded and how much would be rumor and which would damage him more. Being a vampire is largely a matter of curating your reflection in conversations you do not attend. He lifted two fingers and the air wearing agents softened around the edges the way people do when they are told to smile before a camera. It was not a retreat. It was a costume change.\n\n\u201cParole,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder notice of forum, under oath of witness, under the eye of an object pretending not to be a clock. Where is your place?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bridge That Isn\u2019t,\u201d I said, and he had to close his eyes to hide the flicker because he knew it, and because in our line of work the real injury is admitting knowledge at the wrong time. \u201cLeave Vale at the Leviathan\u2019s foot. Leave Kaia at the stairs that are always closed. Do not follow her, do not watch her, do not send the air to learn about her. Count to two thousand with your mouth shut and an orange in your teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a ridiculous man,\u201d he said, but his mouth softened the way mouths do when pain arrives in a polite suit. \u201cAnd if I obey you, you will call it friendship.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you obey me, I will call it law,\u201d I said. \u201cI have called other things friendship and regretted it less.\u201d\n\nWe made the bargain. It is how this city remains the shape it is. We take our knives and we lay them briefly beside each other and pretend this is a meal. The parole was not a document yet, but the Archive had already started to copy our mouths. When enough people decide to remember something the Night can only burn so many notebooks.\n\nKaia moved first. She did not look like someone being given safe conduct. She looked offended at the idea that she had ever needed it. She came down from the platform as if it were a chair she was finished with. She put her hand, lightly and unceremoniously, on Vale\u2019s sleeve. She leaned in as if to tell him to speak louder and then I saw her lips move and even without a microphone I could see the shape of the syllables: stay in the middle. Do not let them peel you. He nodded. He is stupid about many domestic things, it turns out, but not about taking instruction regarding his skin.\n\nI turned and took two steps because my job here was done and because the weight at my back had begun to count to thirteen while pretending it wasn\u2019t counting. The braid would hold, Ash had promised, but I could feel the fibers thinking about regrets. Sevrin matched me. He did not put his hand on me. He carried his own body like a man in a painting that expects an arrow.\n\n\u201cYou will come to the Apse,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will not make me spend my little stock of mercy on chasing you into a sewer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could spend it on plums,\u201d I said. \u201cThe children are unimpressed by your Latin.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be cruel,\u201d he said, and in that moment he was not the Night but a tired thing wearing fancy teeth. \u201cYou know what it costs me to walk away from a door I could lock.\u201d\n\nI stopped because I am not cruel when it hurts the wrong person. \u201cI will come,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I will stop in two places first.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not have that much blood to play with,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWho said anything about mine,\u201d I said, and that was a cheap shot because I could see him calculating, instantly, the other bodies I could be about to spend. \u201cI will go to the Bridge and I will go to the door that is Always Closed and then I will give you the remainder of what the braid leaves me.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery dramatically,\u201d he said. \u201cGods forgive you your taste.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am new at this,\u201d I lied, and he let me because we both needed to pretend some skills arrive late.\n\nUnder the Leviathan the parole dissolved into the old river air and the carved feet of a creature that never had a body to carry it. Vale went one way escorted by citizens who had decided their bodies counted as laws today. Kaia vanished down the stair that tells everyone to mind its manners. The Night watched the place where she had been as if watching could make a pattern they\u2019d recognize the next time. I planted myself in the flow and let the city bump me until the current decided to push me toward Ash, and then it was as if the cobbles had been greased with something that doesn\u2019t stain.\n\nThe room behind Always Closed was not any of its three default moods. It had had an evening since I left and evenings are heavy. It had decided to be a kitchen where the kettle whistle is two notes flat and a small sharp dog sleeps beside the cold stove and the wallpaper believes in flowers. Ash was not behind the pillar. She was at the table counting matches with a care that made me suspect each match had a childhood. She did not look up. She knew the weight in the doorway. You do not study a door for twenty years without learning to tell who uses it by inclination.\n\n\u201cYou have thirteen grains of rice in your pocket and three lies under your tongue,\u201d she said, and lifted the lid of the sugar tin to check it was still sugar and not something that wanted to be. \u201cI will take the lies for later. Spit them in my hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need your poverty,\u201d I said. \u201cI need your doors that open only for women who knit and men who don\u2019t apologize. I need your children who can hold breath longer than the river. The Night will try to come through the little holes while everyone looks at the big mouth. I need them stopped with string and laughter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need the city to defend itself,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine. We\u2019ve been practicing.\u201d\n\nShe did not scold me for asking. She never scolds people doing late good. She opened the tin where she keeps old train tickets that she pretends are lucky because luck is a language and not a fact. She handed me three blue ones with corners gone to tooth. \u201cShow these to anyone who asks for a password,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly fools ask for passwords. My children prefer souvenirs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSevrin wants me at the Apse,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOf course he does,\u201d she said without rancor. \u201cHe wants to hold your hand while they feed you to the mouth he works for and tell himself he has at last done you the favor of neatness. Do you want me to call him Uncle while you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to tell him the bear has moved,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd that honey is not a metaphor.\u201d\n\nShe squinted as if turning that around in the back of her head. \u201cYou are taking the oath out of the oath-room,\u201d she said, and if I had been a person who believed in signs I would have believed in that one because her face did something very small and very old when she said it. \u201cYou are going to the Archive. Alone, because you think that makes you more noble and more precise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going alone because if I take anyone I love, the Night will put them on a scale and make me choose between weight and shape,\u201d I said. \u201cI have handled enough scales for a lifetime.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoward,\u201d she said, and this was not an insult. It is a mercy to be named. \u201cTake the dog. He bites without caring about pedigrees.\u201d\n\nThe dog opened one eye and judged me suitable for biting. I declined him politely. \u201cIf I come back this way\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you do, bring me a piece of the handless clock. I like useless faces.\u201d\n\nI put one of the blue tickets on the table beside her matches. It wasn\u2019t a payment. It was a promise to remember a trick she had taught me when my hands were still trying to decide whether they belonged to a person or a plan. She flicked it with one nail and made it sing a little and that was a benediction.\n\nUpstairs the city had not transformed. It had clarified. Sometimes you change the world not by painting it a new color but by reminding people they can see. The Night had receded the way the tide does when it remembers there are other bays and other boats. The braid made teeth again and I answered it with arithmetic. Each step to the Apse took a year you could fold into an envelope if you had the right glue. Sevrin would have had people watching for me to go left. I went left. It is very satisfying, sometimes, to obey the enemy where they cannot stand being obeyed.\n\nThe Clock had, for most of my adult life, refused time. That is a kind of politics. Today it refused me first and then, grudgingly, accepted my weight the way an old horse accepts a rider who still remembers how to sit. The Apse was mostly empty because vampires don\u2019t need rooms for ceremony when the city is doing its own spectacle. Mire waited like a blot that had never wanted to pretend to be ink. The Countess perched with the grace of a girl in a dress she had practiced in front of mirrors until mirrors adored her. Two junior nocturnals stood so still the dust liked their shoulders.\n\n\u201cMaster Kade,\u201d Mire said, as if I had arrived to replace a hinge. \u201cYou cost us today.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou paid,\u201d I said. \u201cYou hate it when the two match.\u201d\n\nThe Countess slid an eyebrow into a place where it could be admired and found wanting. \u201cYou thread loopholes into your own hangings,\u201d she said. \u201cQuite the seamstress.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d I said. \u201cTalk plain. You intended to break a man in public and make the break sing like his fault. You used my daughter\u2019s throat to carry the tune. I picked up the note and put it somewhere safer. I will be given, in return, at least the courtesy of not being told it was a misunderstanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cCourtesy is for kings and children,\u201d Mire said. \u201cWe employ neither.\u201d\n\nSevrin entered behind me and the room changed the way a weather vane changes its mind when the wind remembers a story from its childhood. He smelled like the river and like furniture polish and like worry. He took his place at Mire\u2019s right hand with the neatness of habit. I was determined not to see how relieved I was to have his spine in the room to press words against.\n\n\u201cYou want to unmake your oath,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not waste our time arranging cushions around the furniture. Say the thing you came to say badly. We will clean it up and make it fit on a shelf.\u201d\n\nI thought of Ash\u2019s kitchen where the matches were saints and the kettle held songs for better days. I thought of my daughter\u2019s fingers on my wrist, not feeling the story she expected to find. I thought of the city counting itself, finally. I did not bother with pretty.\n\n\u201cI rescind consent,\u201d I said. \u201cI withdraw from the Oath of Necessary Instruments. Under clause of self-recusal for contamination of anchor. Under clause of irreparable conflict. Under emergency provision of prior wrong. Under the doctrine of a wizard\u2019s right to die his own death.\u201d\n\nSilence arrived like a parent at the edge of a playground.\n\n\u201cThat doctrine was always a joke,\u201d the Countess said at last, with admiration because even vampires can love a well-placed jest. \u201cYou lay it in there on a dare and left it for the day you needed to say something that made the air blush.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a joke until it is not,\u201d I said. \u201cLike morning. Like justice. Like being friends with the man who signs your meals.\u201d\n\nMire\u2019s mouth did that thing it does when he is about to name what everyone else has been warmed up to avoid. \u201cYou cannot rescind,\u201d he said. \u201cOaths are not paper. They are glue.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou used my blood,\u201d I said. \u201cYou do not get to be shocked when it grows scabs. I renounce. I have the right by the very terms you prefer. The city heard me give that oath. The city will hear me take it back. If you insist on theater, you have to accept the script has other readers.\u201d\n\nSevrin shifted, not quite a step but the space between a breath and the next one. \u201cThere is a way,\u201d he said, low, and Mire turned his head as if to bite his ear for daring to contribute. \u201cDo not look at me as if you did not hire me to solve your continuity errors. The Archive will not allow an oath to be removed without its seat being filled. If Kade puts down the Necessary, someone must pick up the book it rested on. He has found someone to hold it while he runs.\u201d\n\nI did not let my face tell lies about surprise. \u201cDo not look at me as if you did not train me to see ladders in paintings,\u201d I said to him. \u201cI have someone to hold the book and it is not someone who will be gentle with the pages.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour daughter,\u201d the Countess said, and smiled because sometimes even clever children put their fingers on the hot pan and say ow in a way that amuses the aunt who warned them. \u201cHow circular. How Greek.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not your altar,\u201d I said, and it came out too fast, too sharp. The braid bit down and I bit back on the sound. \u201cAnd she does not hold your doctrine. She holds only a piece of me I am giving her because I owe her more than I have left. She will hold the weight, not the leash. I use your shapes, Archon, I do not feed you on my family\u2019s bone.\u201d\n\nMire considered whether to be offended. Offense is a tool. He is a man who counts his tools when he leaves a room. \u201cUnmake your oath, then,\u201d he said, at last. \u201cDo it here, under our eyes. And when you have unmade it, understand that what made you useful to us will be gone, and we will be free to treat you as a man who knows too much and belongs to no mechanism.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already treat me like that,\u201d I said, and stepped into the space in the floor that they use for weathers. Every room with a drain has a place where the air and the stone agree to speak if you insist. I took three breaths and they were not neat. I said my true name and it rolled out like a coin under a cabinet where you cannot retrieve it without lying on the dirty floor. I said the name they wrote in my file and it sat on my tongue like a spoon that had never stirred anything but broth. I said the name my daughter had not called me because fathers are a kind of language you learn from other mouths and she had no dictionaries left. The room did not like being confused. Good. I roped the confusion and tied it to the Archivum Root. Then I told the Oath it had a hole in it and I crawled out.\n\nI have rarely felt more ordinary. It feels like taking off a ring that has made your finger its permanent address. It feels like walking out of a house without your boots on. It feels like air having the audacity not to be cold solely for you. It hurt less than the braid. It hurt longer.\n\nThe Archive made a sound like a book closing in another city. The Countess flinched because vampires do not expect paper to make teeth. Mire did not move. He is very good at not moving. Sevrin reached for the back of a chair and found it and did not sit because that would look like relief and he does not perform that piece for anyone anymore.\n\n\u201cYou think you are free,\u201d Mire said. \u201cHow sweet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I am expensive,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you do not like the receipt.\u201d\n\nHe flicked his fingers and two of the air-wearers slid toward me as if they were on strings. They were going to take wrists, old joke, new method. Sevrin did not stop them because that is not the part he plays. The Countess did not stop them because she had to see how I moved without the Oath to guess if I had taken anything else on my way out the door. I lifted my arms because I had promised Sevrin cups and I prefer to keep my little promises in rooms where large ones bleed.\n\n\u201cOn your way,\u201d Mire said, with a sort of parson\u2019s charity. \u201cTo your Bridge. To your dog. To your daughter who makes her hair tell secrets. You have made a day\u2019s mess. We will find the broom that fits it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what you always forget,\u201d I said. \u201cThe broom is the thing that remembers where all the dirt is. It does not love the hand that holds it.\u201d\n\nI left with wrists politely encircled by men who think manners make manacles. Sevrin did not walk with me because that would be too much like sympathy, but he placed himself where my shoulder could see him. He is good at that also. The city stroked my face as if checking for fever. The braid tugged and I tugged back. We made a poor dog and a stubborn leash. I went to the Bridge.\n\nThe Bridge That Isn\u2019t gets its name from letting people go places without admitting to it. As a structure, it is the least interesting thing in the city. As a rumor, it could float a cathedral. Under it, people come to bargain with the water when the water refuses their coins. On top of it, children spit and count how long before the drops learn sky. Today it was a piece of concrete with history painted in dueling graffiti hands and a sense that if you squinted you could see twenty-seven versions of the same argument layered until only the verbs still glowed. Vale stood near the midpoint with men and women forming a circle around him like a new kind of weather. He was not hiding. He is uninterested in hiding. He understands tunnels, which is not the same thing.\n\nKaia had not come here. Good. She had elders who weren\u2019t me and doors that like her better than they like anyone living. The parole crackled like cellophane and I knew we had seconds instead of minutes. I moved to Vale and did not pretend I had arrived for a chat. His eyes flicked over me, counted damage, counted uses left, counted how many more syllables he could afford.\n\n\u201cYou bought me thirteen minutes,\u201d he said, gratitude short and tidy because that\u2019s the habit of his house. \u201cWhat do I owe you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou owe the children plums,\u201d I said, because learning to be in charge includes learning to deliver sweets on time. \u201cAnd you owe the city a promise you can keep. Not the big one. The small one. Promise not to disappear when this gets ugly. Promise to be difficult where everyone can see you. That is cheaper for the rest of us.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. His mouth considered a smile and vetoed it. He was about to speak when the braid bit so hard my vision folded into accordion. I put my palm on the cold-flat rail and told the weight a story about walking uphill with groceries and it consented to be a hill and not a cliff. Vale saw more than I wanted him to. He said the words for water someone taught sailors when prayers were still sensible. He is a man who knows how to have superstitions in public without apologizing. I liked him better for it.\n\n\u201cThey will come for your girl,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not have to be a vampire to know which lever pulls the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will come for your lovers,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd your cooks and the old woman who taught you to make a bed square enough to sleep in and the lieutenant who keeps you from saying the wrong word when you are tired. They will come for your barber and your cobbler and the boy who runs between you and the telephone because old habits make faster lines. Do not list them. If you list them they become a menu.\"\n\nHe met my eye and I think\u2014I think he chose not to ask. He is wise enough to understand that if you ask a man like me how many people he has already fed to this machine, the answer becomes a rope. Instead he put his palm over mine on the rail as if we were two men instructing a child in how to lean.\n\n\u201cTwo hours,\u201d I said. \u201cI used some.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll spend the rest,\u201d he said. \u201cI am good at budgets.\u201d\n\nWe were interrupted by the sound of a violin doing its best to be a siren. No one plays a violin like that unless there is a message jammed under the strings. I turned and saw a boy with hair like new bronze standing on one of the statues that ignores people for a living. He saw me see him and tilted the fiddle toward the east. I do not know how the city arranged to make its errands so pretty, but I have always admired it for trying. East meant the yards. East meant Kaia. East meant too much.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d Vale said, before I could explain that I was not at his orders because I am vain about my freedoms. \u201cWe can count on our own. We can be difficult without you watching.\"\n\n\u201cTry,\u201d I said, and there was affection in it because I am capable of that in short bursts. \u201cMake a mess they cannot sweep without wrinkling their shoes. They hate wrinkled shoes.\u201d\n\nI ran. It was not attractive. My body had opinions and none of them were printable. The braid sang its bad little song. The air tried to do the thing air does when you want it to be loyal. I told it a joke about pipes and rats and an emperor who did not have the decency to wear underclothes. It let me pass and then tried to make the man behind me trip. I like the city best when it chooses mischief over obedience.\n\nThe yards were a geometry lesson you fail on purpose. Cranes make gods out of iron until you walk up close and realize they are tired animals held together with rivets and bribery. Kaia had chosen a place between an engine that ought to have died and a pile of tin signs that still believed they were advertisements. She had the red strip tied around her upper arm now, not in her hair. That made me happier than it should have. A woman with a red arm reads differently to the Night than a girl with a red ribbon. Around her were five or six bodies shaped by hunger and good jokes. One of them had the look of a priest who has found God hiding under a sink. Ash leaned on a spool of cable and tried to look like furniture. The dog, the same rude animal who had judged me earlier, had, in violation of all prophecies, decided to be loyal to Kaia instead.\n\n\u201cYou are late,\u201d she said, because some daughters practice on politeness the way other people practice on pianos and get bored early.\n\n\u201cI stopped to tell men how to be heroes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt took less time than you\u2019d hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are better at the costumes,\u201d she said, but there was no acid in it, only a shrug. \u201cCome here. I need your wrists.\u201d\n\nWe do our best work with hands in places that were never designed for hands. She took me by the left and turned my arm as if unscrewing the lid of a jar that will not embarrass itself by refusing to open in front of company. She drew a chalk line over the place where the Oath had used to sit. She put three thin needles through the chalk as if pinning a butterfly that does not want to sit still because it thinks it is still alive. She hummed a song I had not sung to her because I do not deserve to be forgiven at the rate humming accomplishes. Ash watched and did not look away when my blood remembered where to go and then decided it would prefer not to. The dog wagged exactly once.\n\n\u201cYou are moving something,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I thought we finished that braid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe reinforced the bridge,\u201d she said, and her mouth made a little sideways movement that was not entirely laughter. \u201cNow we are putting a tollhouse in. If anyone tries to cross who is not you, they get to explain themselves in a language they do not speak. It will slow the Night long enough for Auntie Knife to steal their pockets.\u201d\n\nAsh bowed from the spine as if accepting a title from a king whose land she already owned. \u201cYou arch,\u201d she said to Kaia. \u201cLike you were born to be a doorway. Try very hard not to let the wrong rooms put their furniture in you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoted,\u201d Kaia said, and blew hair out of her face the way my mother had once done when a pot refused to believe that was its proper heat. \u201cFather. The Archive?\u201d\n\n\u201cOpen,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like your women that way,\u201d she said, and she is allowed to say that to me because she is my daughter and because anger has always been the prettiest thing in this city. \u201cSo. We won\u2019t ask it to be polite. We\u2019ll ask it to keep score. When they come\u2014and they are coming, listen to the way the bolts change their names when they walk\u2014give me three names. Not their big ones. The street-names. I\u2019ll feed them into the rust until it forgets how to remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cKaia,\u201d Ash said softly, in the tone you use when a young one is about to do something both glorious and stupid, \u201cdo not invite too much forgetting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that,\u201d she snapped, and then gentled. \u201cI have been hungry in this city as long as I have been loved. I know the taste and the difference. I will be careful with the forgetting.\u201d\n\nThe Night arrived like a hard word at the end of a sentence. They did not wear their agents who do not scuff. They sent others, the kind who like to be seen. Among them a woman with a jaw made for courtrooms and hands that had written very precise checks. She smiled with her mouth and I recognized a notary\u2019s courtesy. Behind her, five shadows not quite touching the ground and a man who kept adjusting his cuff as if it had disappointed him by being linen.\n\n\u201cKaia of the unregistered mouth,\u201d the woman said, unfurling a piece of paper that was not paper and let the air taste the ink. \u201cBy the authority of the Night Registry and the laws of cooperative survival you are to be collected for processing. We admire your work. We regret the lack of proper documentation. We will provide documentation after the fact.\"\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t ask for documentation,\u201d I said. \u201cShe asked for three names.\u201d\n\nThe woman did me the favor of being amused. \u201cYou are no one,\u201d she said. \u201cYour mouth is no one. Your paper is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014the one you wrote,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd were paid for. And had notarized by a man who was tipsy on plum wine and sang to his cat when he stamped it. You do not get to pretend it isn\u2019t yours because you don\u2019t like the mirror.\u201d\n\nAsh laughed and it was the sound of a blade coming out of a sheath that has been oiled by love. \u201cTell her the bear has moved,\u201d she said to me, and I did, and the woman\u2019s eyes did the thing expensive glass does just before it chips.\n\n\u201cYou have no standing,\u201d the woman repeated, choosing to pretend that words can answer more than once if you press them the right way.\n\n\u201cStanding,\u201d I said, and the yards under my feet agreed and the rail agreed and the cranes with their tired animal bones agreed and the dog wagged again because even dogs know when a pun works, \u201cis what I have when I am here. Three names, Kaia.\u201d\n\nThe first was said in the way mothers used to call sons inside at dusk. The second was mumbled in baths where women practiced being brave. The third was tucked into the seam of a boot when a boy realized he could run and get somewhere important. Kaia took them with her fingers and fed them to the rust, and the rust opened its mouth and chewed until the three names could not be used against anyone again without tasting of iron. I watched the woman\u2019s face realize what had been eaten. She had a good face for disappointment. It took it like a cream and made it useful.\n\n\u201cYou are going to make this uglier than it needs to be,\u201d she said to me. \u201cYou are going to injure the people you think you are saving. You are going to make us take your city away with tools you taught us how to use.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to have our rust,\u201d I said, and Kaia smiled as if I had finally passed an exam she had been ready to grade for years. \u201cYou can have our marbles and our marble and our people with names that fit inside your mouths. You do not get our tired metal that sharpens itself at night. That belongs to us.\u201d\n\nThey came anyway. Of course they did. Laws are umbrellas in hail. The first agent stepped over the place where Kaia had made the tollhouse and tripped without falling. He looked down, insulted. Ash flicked a wire at his ankle and told the wire to remember a dance. It obliged and the man had to teach his limbs how to be useful all over again. The woman with the jaw opened her mouth to call for a more violent shape and I laid my hand on the engine that had never learned to die, and I offered it my braid.\n\nIt did not care about politics. It cared about being a machine. It loved that I respected its old pride. It coughed and spat and then did what machines do when you let them be what they are: it made a noise no one had planned. Some men run at noise, some go still, some step back, and the ones who wanted to be seen stepped forward because vanity is strong. The rust took their names faster when they stepped into its teeth.\n\nWe do not win when we are outnumbered and the other side does not need sleep and the audience is large enough to try on courage. We get a margin. Today that is all I had promised and all I was ready to be. We did not hold them. We gave them splinters. By the time Sevrin found us because he always does, the woman had collected two of our best jokes and a boy who had not yet learned to count to eight without using toes. Kaia had bled once and wiped it on her arm with a face that said blood is not particularly interesting when it is yours. Ash had lost her knife and gained a screwdriver and discovered it cut better in this weather. The dog had chosen one ankle and made it his job for the day. I had spent almost the last thread of my braid and it was beginning to hum as if remembering a lullaby that had killed better men.\n\nSevrin did not call my name this time. He did not need to. He took in the map and drew a better one. He lifted his hand half an inch and six of the air-wearers found a reason to be reassigned. He spoke to the woman with the paper under his breath and her jaw went from courtroom to kitchen. He turned to me and for a moment I saw the boy two hundred years ago singing to a cat because the stamp made a good sound.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have made your scene. Give me the remainder of your hour and I will spend it throttling my own to keep them out of your pockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot keep your mouth clean forever,\u201d Ash said cheerfully in his ear. \u201cYou\u2019ll swallow a tooth.\u201d\n\nHe ignored her, which was brave. He looked at Kaia and said, careful as if the name would argue with him, \u201cI am sorry I brought plums to a child it turned out I would someday try to starve.\u201d\n\nShe raised her chin the way women do when they refuse to be made responsible for your guilt. \u201cBring more plums,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t sign your name to a paper you don\u2019t want children to read.\u201d\n\nHe smiled without the part where mouths become weapons and it made him look as if he could die. I am not sure whose mercy that was for.\n\nThen he took my elbow not because he thinks I am fragile but because he knows what happens to a bridge when too many coats cross. \u201cCome,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us finish a piece properly. We will give your daughter a quarter of an hour with her friends and you will come and be forgiven in a way that makes you more useful to our accountants.\u201d\n\n\u201cForgiven,\u201d I said, and felt the braid fray and felt the apology I do not deserve jostle with the anger I have no right to and decided to take neither. \u201cWe will make a different verb.\u201d\n\nHe nodded as if we had agreed on the price of fruit. He is tired. He is old. He is wearing a night that suits him and a conscience that doesn\u2019t. We walked together back into the part of the city that believes in the kind of light that makes paperwork legible. Behind us someone began to laugh about a dog who had learned to bite linen without tearing it. Ahead of us the handless face waited to be told what to do with its empty.\n\nOn the steps of the Apse the junior nocturnals stood like salt shakers at a table set for a feast that had not decided whether to happen. The Countess had changed dresses, which means she had changed tactics. Mire sat as if men who sit decide things. In my chest the little old machine that had taught me about ticking lifted a paw. It informed me, politely, that we were at the place in the day when the bell remembers why it bothers. I thought of Kaia\u2019s hand on my wrist and the way she had taught my geas to be a plank instead of a mouth and I thought: if we are all making a world, some of us should be nails. I followed Sevrin in and I did not lower my eyes.",

The handless face watched as if time were a trick only children believed, and perhaps we were all children, trying to make a rule with our mouths and a game with our hands. Mire did not stand to greet us; he does not stand unless someone has fallen. The Countess had changed to ash silk with a border of beads that looked like drops of blood being taught to behave. The junior nocturnals had found new pens that pretended to be birds. Sevrin\u2019s shoulder was a square you could lean punctuation on.\n\n\u201cYou are late to your own ending,\u201d the Countess said, her voice all bright rooms and indictments wrapped in lace. \u201cI suppose we cannot be surprised that an instrument forgets the player once it tastes applause.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am here,\u201d I said, because it is sometimes the only sentence that does anything in a room convinced of its own geometry. The weight at my back had learned a new rhythm in the yards: it wanted to be a heartbeat and was offended that I did not have one to offer. It thudded anyway, a fake metronome for a dance we were not rehearsing.\n\nMire set his fingertips together like a tent for a saint with nowhere else to sleep. \u201cStrip the poetry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have arithmetic to do. You rescinded, and the Archive admits it. You threaten intercalation, which is vandalism masquerading as wit. You demand parole in public. You have a daughter who has taken a bite of our information and found it to her taste. You stand, therefore, at the place we reserve for problems we will not yet call enemies. Give us the piece of this you still intend to control.\u201d\n\nI found it difficult not to admire, in some private corner of myself that had never been successfully legislated, the economy of his inventory. \u201cThree things,\u201d I said, holding up no fingers because counting with your body in front of predators is an invitation to inventory. \u201cFirst: recognize the Open Forum as precedent and not indulgence. The bell tolled; the mouth declared; the handless face watched. Codify it. Thirteen and thirteen, no overt enforcement, no covert violence, no anchors laid within the amphitheater\u2019s radius as defined by the bones of the old stacks. Write it. Stamp it. File it where your eldest can find it with their eyes closed. Second: a moratorium on tithes in the river wards for twenty-one dusk-cycles. Call it an audit. Call it a festival of restraint. Call it a test of nobility if you want to admire your reflection while you count. But stop the bleeding and say you meant to. Third: safe conduct pledged under your seal and mine for Kaia\u2014named and unnamed\u2014and for General Vale\u2014named and numbered\u2014to their places named earlier. I have already spent the city\u2019s patience. I am spending yours now. Spend something back.\u201d\n\nThe Countess tilted her head so that the beads on her collar whispered to her collarbones. \u201cYou are cute when you threaten us with paperwork,\u201d she said, toy-sweet and salt underneath. \u201cYour second demand is clumsy. Even benevolence scandals if performed wrong. The wards will think hunger is a trick you taught them. The Registry will think you are trying to embarrass its accountants. You are. Mire hates that.\u201d\n\nMire did not waste a movement on confirming what anyone in the room could have named. \u201cWe will not be bullied into philanthropy. But we can be persuaded into decorum. We will accept the first. We will perform the third in the manner already begun. For the second\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCall it calibration,\u201d Sevrin said, in the tone one uses to explain to clever children that the game was meant to be educational. \u201cThe tithes have drifted. A modest recalibration allows us to claim prudence. Two wards, seven cycles, public notice published under the Observatory\u2019s crest. All parties may pretend to be annoyed. No one must starve today for appearance\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nI turned my head to look at him and saw, just briefly, the shape of the man who taught me to taste iron in fruit without making a face. He had put a word in the only place Mire kept space for kindness\u2014the column that balances the ledgers. Mire made an irritated sound that could have been a laugh once and moved one ring a fraction higher on his finger. \u201cDo it,\u201d he said, and four pens scratched at once, the room\u2019s version of applause.\n\n\u201cNow we come to the price you will pay for acting as if footnotes are levers,\u201d the Countess went on, voice gone lantern-bright. \u201cYou rescind. The Oath leaves your bones. The shape remains. We cannot leave the shape unfilled or there will be drafts in the walls we did not design. You will name a proxy for the portion of your knowledge we refuse to lose. You will place your true name shard\u2014don\u2019t preen, Kade, you are not the only creature who keeps a mirror in his mouth\u2014in escrow with the Archive for the duration of this moratorium. Insurance. Not an executioner\u2019s hobby. Think of it as responsible governance.\u201d\n\nI touched my tongue to my palate. The shard lay there like a coin under a tongue on a dare. \u201cYou put your hands in my mouth,\u201d I said. \u201cAlways so intimate for people who do not eat.\u201d\n\nSevrin\u2019s eyes flicked to the handless face and back to me. \u201cYou have a dead-man\u2019s switch,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not waste our time denying what you are most proud of. If we break the Open Forum, if we bruise the parole, if we take what we just signed from your daughter\u2019s skin\u2014your switch trips and the Clock remembers morning in a way that will give our elders palpitations they have not practiced for. I cannot curate panic. Untidy. Give us something that says you will not do that for lesser provocations. Give us something we can carry to the elders that isn\u2019t just your reputation and my bad temper.\u201d\n\nHe had called the crater in me by its name and asked me to fill it with something other than my taste for spectacle. It is disarming, when an old friend refuses to pretend he thinks you are being noble. \u201cYou will have a key, then,\u201d I said. \u201cBut not to the switch. To the bag it sits in. A bag you cannot open alone. Third-party escrow. Not your Archive. Not mine. Aunties\u2019 Registry.\u201d\n\nMire made a sound that did not have room for vowels. The Countess laughed so sharply one of the junior nocturnals wrote down her laughter as if it had teeth you could catalog. \u201cYou want us to let the feral women under the Leviathan hold our crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, darling, do it. If we must be modern, let us be modern with knives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis city already holds your crisis,\u201d I said. \u201cI am just naming the drawer. The Aunties have long memories and bad manners. Perfect ... stewards. Ash will keep the switch in her kitchen sugar tin. You will leave her matches alone and bring her oranges when you\u2019re invited. If you try to take it with hands you call clean, it will bite and then you will be embarrassed in front of children. You do not like that.\u201d\n\nI could feel Sevrin putting the proposal into one of his internal boxes and shaking it to see if anything inside ratted. He liked that there were children in the deal. He did not like that there were knives. He liked anything that gave him something to protect that was not just us. He said nothing. Mire, because he understands when he is cornered and when pretending not to be makes him smaller, nodded once. \u201cWrite it,\u201d he said again, and the pens moved like fish in a feeding.\n\nThe marble under my feet had been built to transmit voices upwards; we were standing in a mouth. I thought, briefly and impolitely, of the day I had given my Oath. It had been in a smaller room with walls that wore the color of milk past its date. A boy had brought a tray with six sheets of silver leaf and a porcelain bowl of water that believed itself holy until it saw what we asked it to carry. Sevrin had stood at my left and the Archon of that day\u2014older, greyer, more polite, long since recycled into law\u2014had stood at my right. I had chewed the leaf because you do not taste the law unless it tastes you. I had said the words and felt them find the hooks in my bones they\u2019d been carved for. I had been asked, very prettily, if I understood the difference between instrument and agency. I said I did and I didn\u2019t and both answers were true. There had been no daughter then, only the possibility of not having one. You do not have to be forgiven, to be allowed to remember.\n\n\u201cNow say your rescission again,\u201d the Countess murmured, bright with hunger and interest. \u201cI would hear it in the big room. The small room has a cheap echo.\u201d\n\nI stepped into the circle where someone had once intended incense and someone else had decided that smoke made people imagine bad things. The braid at my back knotted briefly as if seated more comfortably. \u201cUnder the Truces of Long Dusk and the Oaths of Necessary Instruments,\u201d I said, in the tone that makes the Archive put on spectacles and look up, \u201cI, Kade-of-three-names, rescind consent. I withdraw. I reassign my usefulness to the city that taught me to count and to the aunties\u2019 tin that keeps other people\u2019s secrets without pretending to bless them. I do this under clause of contamination, clause of irreparable conflict, clause unwritten and therefore inevitable. Witness me.\u201d\n\nThere are rooms that applaud. The Apse does not. But something in the stone marked me, like chalk on a suit jacket shoulder at a party you have to stay at because your ride is drunk. Mire flicked two fingers, meaning: proceed. Sevrin\u2019s mouth did not move but I felt him mouth the last word along with me, not out of solidarity. Out of habit. That is worse. Habits are more binding than any good spell.\n\n\u201cNow you will give us your shard,\u201d the Countess said. \u201cAnd you will be walked to the Archive vault and you will place it between pages you cannot see. You will do this meekly and without invoking grandmothers or bridges. You will remember that you are alive because we thought it would be more interesting.\u201d\n\nI took the shard from my mouth and tasted iron and light and the sick vanilla of paper that has been too ambitious about its own scent. The thing looked like nothing. That is how you recognize the important objects. They refuse to be polite. I kept it on my tongue and did not place it in my palm. \u201cThe shard goes to Ash,\u201d I said. \u201cOr to whichever Aunt has firm hands and a better kettle. You may escort it to her door. You may count her matches without touching them. You may pretend, if it helps you sleep, that you are participating in a modernization initiative.\u201d\n\nMire\u2019s eyelids did the thing they do when someone else\u2019s joke insists on standing up and being introduced. He disliked this, and he would accept it. \u201cSevrin,\u201d he said. \u201cGo and be charming. Negotiate with the bear. Return before your elders ask why you are not present for the meal.\u201d\n\nSevrin half-bowed, the old habit again, and then turned to me. \u201cYou look like a man who has to choose whether to faint in front of his enemies,\u201d he murmured. His voice is a good knife because it never pretends not to cut. \u201cStay vertical until we finish knitting this into the city. Then I will allow you to collapse, and I will put a blanket over your knees and call it mercy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will call it debt,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know me. I do not carry blankets into people\u2019s houses without writing the date on the tag.\u201d\n\nWe moved, the room moving around us because the Apse has always adjusted itself to look better in its own stories. The corridor to the Archive smells like chalk and the last person who did not understand how to keep records. The handless face above us showed nothing, which is a kind of loyalty. Two Juniors took up places behind me and tried to walk without sound. The braid took this as challenge and thumped on each step as if to say: if you will not acknowledge me as a heart, I will be a drum.\n\n\u201cYour Countess will try to make my daughter help you dress your wound,\u201d I said quietly to Sevrin when the dark of the corridor covered our mouths and made them feel private. \u201cShe will make it look like patronage. She will bring ribbons and notions and make her laugh against her will, and when the laughter is done she will have placed a hook or two in the silk. Stop her. Not because I asked. Because for once you should deny yourself a beautiful instrument.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not mine,\u201d he said, with a weariness that landed on his shoulders like a patient cat. \u201cNeither of you are. That has always been the difficulty. You are not the sort of toys that sit where one leaves them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was designed to be a toy that writes its own instructions,\u201d I said, and he did not disagree, which was not kindness. It was a fact with its shoes off.\n\nThe Archive\u2019s door is older than any oath we have on file. It was a gate once in a city that had different teeth. When you put your palm to its wood you can feel the places where hands were allowed or forbidden, and all the ghostly yeses and nos lay one atop another so thick you could call it velvet if you were the sort of person who liked to make metaphors buy drinks. The woman in the vestibule looked at us both, at our collars and at the shadow that follows every vampire like a well-trained dog, and then she did a strange thing for a night like this: she smiled as if we were her nephews and had brought her gossip instead of trouble.\n\n\u201cYou make us busy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you also make my hours interesting. Come in. Take your shoes off in your heads. We do not like mud in here, but we do like honest feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cEdda,\u201d Sevrin said, inclining his head. \u201cI will bring you lemons when I am allowed to shop again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will bring me stories, child,\u201d she said, and then looked at me. \u201cAnd you will keep your clever hands off the spines you wrote because you will be tempted to add an apology to the margins. Do not. The Archive does not enjoy contrition. It wrinkles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am out of apologies,\u201d I said. \u201cI have angry footnotes. They fit better.\u201d\n\nWe did not go to the vault. The vault is for things the city refuses to remember and does not yet know how to forget. We went to the Annex of Binding Instruments, where the air has learned to lie down when told and the shelves carry more law than literature and treat both as recipes. Edda gave us a table that had been used for bread long before it learned to host betrayal. She set down three cups and poured hot water over dried mint and something else that tasted like a green that had never seen light. \u201cPut it down,\u201d she said, and I did not, and she raised one eyebrow in a way that made my mother\u2019s ghost, if she has one, check its hair. \u201cOn the wood, Kade. The tin women are not afraid of your name. Why are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt leaves a taste in the air,\u201d I said, and laid the shard down anyway. \u201cI am vain enough to aim it.\u201d\n\nSevrin took a small square of blue paper from his sleeve and put it next to the shard. A train ticket, corner chewed. I had not told him about the tin. He had gone to Ash enough times to learn she likes coupons better than crowns. The Archive settled, in that slow way the elderly use to tell a joke with a long setup. Edda took a cord and made a loop and then a slip and then not a knot at all, and still the packet held. \u201cThis is not escrow,\u201d she said to Sevrin with the mild disdain one reserves for students who try to show off their penmanship. \u201cThis is trust. It only looks like rope so you can bear to believe in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a man who survives on trust,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou are this afternoon,\u201d she said, and tucked the loop into a wooden tray carved with ivy and numbers, and just like that, a piece of me went with a piece of my friend to a kitchen where knives are cleaned with bread ends and arguments are paused to let the dog in.\n\nI should have felt lighter. The braid had other ideas. It misunderstood the removal as invitation. It wound itself twice around whatever the part of me is that shivers when I am watched and pulled. The edge of my vision acquired moths. I put my palm flat on the table and felt the ghost crumbs of other people\u2019s vows. A stranger\u2019s flour can be as consoling as old hymnals. \u201cNow,\u201d I said to Sevrin, because it was rude not to give him what he had earned, \u201cI am going to unwrite a clause into the Clock.\u201d\n\nHe did not flinch. He has learned to contain his flinches in bottles and admire them in private. \u201cYou will not do it here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will not use my Archive for a prank which is not a prank. You will go to the Observatory and you will speak to the face that pretends not to care and you will do it under the eyes of the sky you deny my elders. And you will bring me back the piece of handless you promised your auntie, because if we are to be kissed by scandal we might as well get a souvenir.\u201d\n\nEdda set down her cup very carefully. \u201cDo not chip my table,\u201d she said. \u201cThe last man to unwrite law on it had to sleep in my vestibule for a fortnight because his mouth forgot how to stop.\u201d She looked at me differently then, as if trying to see whether I was trees or paper made from them. \u201cIf you put your hand in the face, you will not get the same hand back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a toy,\u201d I said, and my smile tasted of copper. \u201cMy parts are replaceable.\u201d\n\nIt was not bravery. It was a statement about manufacture. Sevrin took that the way he takes whisky when he does not want to admit to liking it. \u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore your daughter decides to offend someone I am trying to like.\u201d\n\nWe left Edda with her cord and her amused contempt. The Annex door closed on us like a big book. The corridor let us rehearse a thousand disagreements and shelved all of them because the Archive does not keep anyone\u2019s tantrums. When we reached the stair, the city turned its head in its sleep and showed us one bloodshot eye. Outside, the air had decided to smell like metal that believes in rain. Children ran past with their mouths open, catching words the way other children catch snow. Somewhere a kettle declared independence and someone cheered.\n\nAt the bottom step Sevrin paused, and I stopped because it is dangerous to move when someone else intends your step. \u201cWhen we are done,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will not come back with me to the Apse. You will not let me walk you into a room where men like Mire can make shapes out of your resignation and call them jurisprudence. You will go to the Observatory and then you will go to the Bridge that Isn\u2019t and then you will walk into the door that lies and you will sit in a chair and you will teach your daughter how to make tea the way your mother failed to teach you because you were busy writing footnotes. You will give me no more scenes to tidy today.\u201d\n\nHe had made a request. He had couched it in commands because that is how both of us keep from admitting to each other that we still know how to ask. \u201cIf they come for her\u2014\u201d I began, and he cut me off with a small, precise slice of the hand.\n\n\u201cThey will,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I will put my body where it embarrasses the others to step, and I will call it budgeting. Do not make me spend my last.\n\nThe Observatory lives on stairs and breath. The colonnade was a rib cage for a creature that had practiced inhaling a thousand years and still hadn\u2019t made a sound it liked. I put my palm to a pillar and let it recognize me. We were not friends. We were something else. I climbed and the braid counted wrong on purpose to force the steps to pay attention. The bell above us was a sleeping animal with a mean temper and a sense of humor. I loved it. It has always preferred to ring when no one believes in it.\n\nThe handless face is not smooth. From below it looks like emptiness. Up close you can see the grooves where hands once learned to tell people what hour was pretending to be important. The metal is pocked with what time does to things that pretend to be above it. No one puts their hand into the face because the Observatory knows how to bite. I had put my hand there once, long ago, on the night the Oath cemented. I had traced a pocket where numbers could hide. I have been accused of many crimes; hiding places is my favorite.\n\n\u201cDo not faint,\u201d I told my knees, and they looked offended at being thought that sentimental. I reached up. The metal tasted of pennies and rain and the inside of a grandfather\u2019s coat. I found the seam my past self had cut for today and slid two fingers along it as if convincing a violin to like me. The pocket opened like a mouth keeping a secret. The braid stiffened and then lay down, surprised to find a floor where it expected teeth.\n\n\u201cYou called the clause,\u201d I told the face, naming the thing ticks do not think they are doing. \u201cOpen Forum. Parole in the open. The bear has moved. A day is missing and will be returned by post. I unwrite the part that lets them refer to footage as sufficient witness. I rewrite witness to require breath visible. I rewrite breath visible to include fog and steam and laughing in small groups. I write that the bell counts as a witness if rung by a child on a bicycle who believes in luck. I write that thirteen becomes fifteen when the handless sees a hand raised without permission. I write the morning into the pocket as escrow. I make it conditional. I shut it with my mouth.\u201d\n\nThe Observatory does not approve of performance. It tolerates a certain degree of poetry when it gets the job done. My hand shook a little, and then a lot, and then stopped because the face tightened on my fingers like a hungry aunt and I had to keep very still if I wanted to keep any of them. I gave the clause my breath. There are days you can do work with sighs. This was not one. I had to spend something that thinks it is mine. It took. It burned. It left a sweetness like a wound licked clean.\n\nDown below, the city made a sound that might have been someone dropping a crate of bolts and might have been a man deciding not to swing his stick just yet and might have been a bell in the mouth of a boy who had decided his luck needed reminding. The Observatory smiled in metal. The pocket closed on itself. I pulled my hand back and counted. Five fingers. All present. The smallest did not quite remember its name. That is the price of rewriting. You lose labels and learn shapes.\n\n\u201cTake your souvenir,\u201d I muttered, to no one and to Ash and to Edda and to my own habit of paying debts when the balance sheet says I should leave town. I levered off a sliver from the edge where the face pretends not to be fastened. It came away too easily and cut my thumb in apology. The blood looked like theater against the old metal. I tucked the shard into my pocket and the weight in my back thanked me in the only language it has: it stopped pretending I was not tired.\n\nOn the stair down, I met a child with a bicycle and a bell that had decided to be brave even when ignored. He looked at me with the entitlement only children and ancient institutions share. \u201cIs there going to be morning?\u201d he demanded, without greeting and with the efficiency of a city that hates oratory and loves results.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be mischief,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd if you keep ringing exactly when you feel like it, you will get accused of being a saint. Saints are terrible at bedtime. Think before you volunteer.\u201d\n\nHe considered this gravely, then rang his bell five times in defiance of common counting, and pedaled away with the sort of concentration you envy if you have not felt simple for a while.\n\nBy the time I reached the bottom, the braid\u2019s singing had become more of a hiss. Two hours was a generous promise when made by a woman whose clock keeps better time than mine. I had spent the generosity. I had bought three things with it and stolen a fourth and needed to pay on a fifth. The city\u2019s breath was a little higher in its chest. The ink we had taught to move like agents had retreated to revise its strategy. The amphitheater throbbed with stories of people who had not crossed a bridge and had done something else instead. The yards smelled like oil and victory and loss, which is to say: like dinner in a poor season.\n\nI did not go to the Bridge That Isn\u2019t. If I did, I would be tempted to stand on it and invent a speech and make someone else finish it. I turned my feet to the Always Closed. The door has a habit of opening when it must and a stiffer habit of staying absolutely itself when people come with paper. I knocked with the knuckles I had not broken yet and then opened it because I have never learned what closed means in this city. The stairs sighed like a woman who has finally taught the bread to rise. The kitchen smelled like pepper and the last of the sugar. Ash sat with her elbow on the table and a string between her teeth, winding it around a pair of nails in a pattern that looked like the skeleton of a map.\n\n\u201cYou look like a man someone pulled out of a river and shook,\u201d she said, without looking up. \u201cPut your souvenir down with the others. We are going to need a clock that refuses to answer when called.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are others who stole pieces?\u201d I asked, and put the sliver down next to a different sliver and a flake and a very small screw you could pretend was anything.\n\n\u201cEveryone keeps trophies,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people are embarrassed by the word. I am not. Sevrin brought me a lemon I did not ask for and a promise he did not know how to keep. Edda sent me rope and told me it was trust. Your daughter brought me names and asked me to boil them until they screamed. We are making a soup. The Night will complain about the smell. Let them.\u201d She looked at me, finally, and her gaze did the thing certain knives do when they find a hair in their line. \u201cSit,\u201d she said, and I sat, because when a woman who has trained her kitchen to become a war room tells you to sit you remember that chairs were invented for falling into.\n\nKaia came in from the other room with a smear of grease on her cheek and the look of someone who had decided to be merciful precisely once today. \u201cYou do not have to say anything,\u201d she said, which is merciful for a woman raised by men who overvalue words. \u201cWe have a quarter of an hour before the Night pretends to understand what it lost. We are going to use it to build three hinges and a doorstop. Give me your hands.\u201d\n\nShe took them without ceremony and turned them over, palms up, as if checking whether I had brought enough coin to buy what we were selling. She ran her fingertip along the crease below my thumb, following the line a schoolchild might have called life before learning better. She nodded, as if I had passed something, and then did the other. \u201cYou are going to sleep,\u201d she said, and the Countess would have made it a cruelty and a caress and Kaia made it a schedule. \u201cNot now. After. I will watch. Auntie will steal the boots off the men in the doorway. Sevrin will pretend to have chosen the right side for once because if he does not he will have to tell a story later that makes his mouth taste like flour. In the morning\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCareful,\u201d Ash said. The word was not about superstition. It was about advertisements. There are some words that bring attention like flies bring trouble.\n\n\u201cIn the afterward,\u201d Kaia amended, humor flat and useful, \u201cwe will not give speeches. We will turn off one machine and turn on another. We will hang a red cloth out the window so the children will know which door has bread. We will teach the dog to sit. We will teach the Night to knock. We will not be polite if they forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cI withdrew,\u201d I said, hearing how small that sounded in a room that had been busy without me. \u201cI put myself on a shelf where I do not belong and told the librarian what to write on the spine. They will come and take me down and bend the cover back and break the glue. I am telling you this because I am very tired of pretending I have enough clever left to stop them.\u201d\n\nKaia stood very still for the length of time it takes to decide to be kind. \u201cYou are not a book,\u201d she said at last. \u201cYou are an engine. Engines can throw rods and still be terrifying. Engines can sit in a yard for a century and still make teenagers fall in love. Engines are allowed to be ugly when they work. Others will put their hands on you and make you pancakes and get burned. They will act as if it was your fault and you will act as if they are right because that is how guilt thinks it earns its keep. Stop it. Let us be burned because we chose to. Let us turn you over. Auntie has a wrench.\u201d\n\nAsh already had it in her hand. She is that sort of woman. \u201cYou have a little time,\u201d she said. \u201cUse it to lay a fuse so clean even the elders will admire it when it goes off. Use it to whisper a riddle into the handless so that when the Night asks a number it cannot count to, the city will laugh. Use it to tell your friend with the tidy suits that if he is going to keep showing up for people he should carry change for the bread lad\u2019s pocket and stop pretending coins are dirty. The Registry falls apart when it cannot pay exact.\u201d\n\nSevrin had not come in. He is not a man who roots himself anywhere there are curtains. He stood in the doorway like a parent owl pretending to be bad at flying so the children will not ask him to do tricks. \u201cYou are insufferable,\u201d he said to Ash, who curtseyed without standing. \u201cAnd you smell like a kitchen my grandmother would have been proud to starve in.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you smell like a boy who broke all his mother\u2019s cherubs because you wanted to see if they had blood,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cBring me oranges next time you intend to be insolent.\u201d\n\nHe turned to me and put two fingers against my temple as if reminding himself I still had a skull. \u201cYou will come when I call,\u201d he said. \u201cNot because the Oath binds you. Because you like being needed. I am calling. The elders will require a performance. You have written a good scene. Come and take your bows. If you do not, they will replace you with a poorer actor and I will be bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always enjoyed an honest review,\u201d I said, and he rolled his eyes because we have always used banter like gauze; it keeps the flies out while we decide where to make the cut.\n\nThe kitchen thickened with the noise of a city considering whether to be coy or to be itself. Somewhere a window banged with impatience. Somewhere the river rattled its chain. Somewhere the bell decided not to ring and rang anyway because boys on bicycles are insubordinate by birthright. We had a quarter of an hour, perhaps less. Kaia pushed the grease off her cheek with the back of her wrist and left a streak that looked like war paint someone chose to keep after the party. Ash breathed, once, and lit a match and blew it out and lit it again until the smell convinced the room it was time to wake.\n\nI stood and the braid reminded me I owed it a song. \u201cI will come,\u201d I said to Sevrin. \u201cI will stand in your Apse and I will let your elders test the ropes on my wrists and I will make a joke about the knots and you will not laugh and the Countess will. I will do this because the city likes a tidy ending and because messy middles exhaust the young. But before I go I will put one more footnote where you will regret it when you find it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake it scandalous,\u201d he said, and his mouth did a small thing in one corner that used to be called affection. \u201cMake it so clever they think you are foolish for having missed it, and then make it cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very tired of being cruel,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I am very good at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour daughter is better,\u201d Ash said, and Kaia did not argue because the argument would have been over whether cruel was the right word and we did not have time to put language on its leash.\n\nWe moved as if the kitchen belonged to a choreography older than any of us. I pinned the braid higher where it could chew on bone not reserved for walking. Kaia put three new needles in where the old ones had grown embarrassed. Ash took the shard of handless and threaded it onto a string with a dried plum pit and a cufflink I recognized from a night I had not survived. Sevrin folded himself into the doorway and unfolded again as if practicing the trick of being furniture. The dog, God bless him, chose my ankle at last and leaned into it with a sigh that admitted to complicity.\n\nWhen we left, the door put on its sign again: CLOSED. It had no time for Always. Always is a kind of promise and the city had too many of those propped unsteadily on counters. The air outside told us who had just lied and who was about to. The street took my feet like a mother who wants to argue while walking. We turned toward the Apse because that is where endings like to drink.\n\n\u201cDo not call the elders \u2018elders,\u2019\u201d Sevrin said, as if imparting a secret that would save me. \u201cCall them by their offices. Never admit to their age. They are obsessed with it. They will hear it as insult.\u201d\n\n\u201cI intend to insult them,\u201d I said. \u201cI am new at being unsubtle. If I am to be forgiven a fashion mistake, let it be that one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would look terrible in sincerity,\u201d he said. \u201cWear sarcasm. It sets off your eyes.\u201d\n\nWe reached the steps and the junior nocturnals did the thing where a spine straightens as if reprimanded by a grandfather. Mire sat with the same stillness as before, but the room had shifted around him, subtle as a woman deciding she will no longer let the men at the end of the table put their drinks on her napkin. The Countess had acquired a small glass bowl of something that looked like candied violets and smelled like funeral sugar. She held it out to me with a smile that had not yet decided whose side of her face it preferred. \u201cFor your nerves,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have those,\u201d I said. \u201cI traded them for a better class of problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe approve,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hate men who keep their lives small so that they can die neatly.\u201d\n\nMire gestured and we took our places. The hall hummed as if the city breathed through its walls. The handless face above us had learned nothing and everything. I lifted my chin so that the braid could rest where it could see and the Archive would hear and the aunties might be tempted to tell a story about a man who took a clock apart with his teeth. Then I began, because it was my turn and because the bell had decided to wait and I have never known what to do with generosity but spend it fast.",

A balcony I had never been permitted to notice revealed its gilt ribs and four chairs that had been designed by someone who believed a back should punish a spine until it confessed its name. In those chairs sat people who had been men and women and then had been offices long enough that the sexes had worn down into grammar. Veils are a tired trick if you do not earn them, but theirs were not to hide faces. They were to teach the room to talk upward. Mire did not stand; he tilted his head as if consenting to be framed by higher frames and the Countess smiled without flashing, tasting the air for theater. Sevrin did the thing he never thinks he does where he sets himself to one side of me and slightly behind, as if a painting of syntax might be improved by a word tucked in the margin.\n\n\u201cRegistry,\u201d said the elder in the chair with a wrist wrapped in a narrow band of tarnished silver, and it was not a greeting so much as a jurisdiction. \u201cThe Archive has whispered. The Clock licked its lips. The city attempted wit and then tasted blood. We will determine whether this was clever or disobedient and behave accordingly. Bring the rescinded instrument forward. He will be weighed.\u201d\n\nI have been weighed before. The Oath rooms can make a body tell its mass without scales. This was different. A tray that had never seen fruit, a rod carved with increments so fine you could measure apology, and three small bags of sand labeled with words I could not read unless I chose to be insulted. The junior nocturnals unfolded the apparatus as if presenting tea and I stepped where they showed me because I had already declared myself a man who accepts the procedures when they were built by hands that understand weight. There is a dignity in allowing yourself to be measured. It does not protect you, but it permits you to choose where to hold your chin.\n\nThe Countess drew a small iron stylus from inside a cuff and turned it between two fingers so that the hall could admire the way light lives in metal when it has been allowed to forget other duties. \u201cWe could cut this short and pretend to be merciful,\u201d she said, which is what passes for kindness in a room that does not believe in mercy, and her voice carried easily because she is a woman who toys with acoustics to remind herself she can. \u201cHe rescinded. We accepted the precedent because we approve of clever footnotes when they feed our own appetite for neatness. Now, the Registry asserts the right to salvage. He is an instrument built in our workshop. If he is putting himself on a shelf where others may borrow him, we must label him properly. This is not about blood. This is about inventory.\u201d\n\nMire did not flinch at the demotion to shopkeeper; he is happiest when he can pretend governance is a store that stocks only solutions. \u201cWeigh,\u201d he said, and the junior nocturnals lowered the rod until it kissed the tops of my shoulders and pretended the touch was intimate. The bags of sand declared their guesses when they were applied and the stylus scratched a line on a slate that had outlived three dynasties. Sevrin did not watch the numbers. He watched my breath. He has never been able to help himself when a body near him chooses to be visible.\n\n\u201cOne hundred and seventy-eight regrets and the remainder in disdain,\u201d announced the elder with the silver band as if figuring out what sort of flour we were working with. \u201cNotable, the absence of awe. The presence of stubbornness at a level we would normally expect in apprentice wrestlers and midwives. The anomaly we were warned about\u2014no pulse where pulses are supposed to be\u2014persists. Very well.\u201d The sentence did not end in therefore. It took no pleasure in being a conclusion.\n\n\u201cThis is the part,\u201d I said, keeping my voice in the library register because the Archive enjoys appearances, \u201cwhere you offer to regularize me. You will find a document written during a prior era of elegance, call it the Concord of Tools, and you will tell me I may be classified as an adjunct to the Night in perpetuity in exchange for the restoration of certain comforts. You will make a speech about protection. You will admire your own generosity while noting my ingratitude. To save time, allow me to decline in advance.\u201d\n\nThe Countess flicked the stylus so that it made an agreeable sound against the slate edging, an E if you were charitable. \u201cIt never ceases to delight me that you write our scripts for us in your head and then undercut them as if this were satire,\u201d she said, and she did not look at Sevrin when she added with sugar, \u201cWe should have kept you hungrier. Men this sure need a meal they can\u2019t finish.\u201d\n\nSevrin let breath out through his nose in the polite version of contempt. \u201cHe is sure because you insisted he draw straight lines with no paper under the table,\u201d he said, and whatever else he might be, he is a man who will sometimes pull a chair out for honesty even if it is only for a moment. \u201cGet to the point. You did not convene to canonize his rebellion. You came to take something back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe came,\u201d said the elder with the silver band, \u201cto perform the Reconciliation Weighing and the Counting of Names. He rescinds the Oath; he claims contamination; he removes himself from the instrumentality we purchased with careful oaths and honest deceit. He may leave, and that is terrifying. He may leave, but not with all of the names he holds in his mouth. There is no law\u2014no law we respect\u2014that allows a contractor to walk from a site with the blueprint tucked in his sleeve. He will forget for us. He will forget where he stitched the laws so they bite. He will forget where he left alleys in the wires. He will forget where morning has been banked. We are not monsters when we behave with paperwork. We will file the forgetting. It is not cruelty. It is inventory.\u201d\n\nIt is one thing to allow the Night to strip you of the glamour of being necessary, another to let them reach into your head and take what you have made and rename it a loss. I think I grinned then, not because there is anything savory about losing memories but because I had expected a different kind of divorce. \u201cYou want my maps,\u201d I said, recognizing in their hunger something that had once nursed me. \u201cYou will not take them. You can sit with me and watch while I give them to the Archive\u2019s vestibule aunties in phrases you will not understand because you do not boil your stories. Or you can tear me apart trying and leave the pieces of my names in a hundred women\u2019s kitchens. Either way, you will not be cataloging me in your tidy script.\u201d\n\nMire was still. He has taught himself a stillness so pure that children check to see if he is moved by wind. \u201cYou invented the alleys you used today,\u201d he said, as if reminding me of the thing I am proud of so that I will be more cooperative. \u201cWe can get along with closing those. You inserted toes between cogs in a place none of us had wanted to admit was a machine. We can pretend those toes were our own. But there is one clause we will not allow to remain uncollected. You told a Clock to care about children\u2019s breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was mine,\u201d I said, allowing myself to be satisfied with a detail because the whole would not be allowed to be owned. \u201cYou do not get it.\u201d\n\nThe Countess, who is not a mother and does not aspire to the role because it is a costume that does not flatter her, did not bother to be offended on behalf of the abstraction. \u201cWe will get something,\u201d she said, sounding less playful, and it is always worth taking note of when a woman who enjoys the theater decides to call the orchestra down. \u201cWe lost face today. In this room, that is expensive. In our houses, that is fatal. Deliver us a concession that sings without making the city weep. Hand us a word we can sell to people who are tired and do not feel like learning new songs. You have some left. You hoard vocabulary like a miser with old buttons.\u201d\n\nI have always hated bargaining where the coin is names. It feels like cutting a child\u2019s hair and putting the braid in a drawer because you liked that version better. \u201cYou can have \u2018deference,\u2019\u201d I said, because there are days when you use the polished silver no one wanted anyway. \u201cIt will live in a statute where citizens who want to help can sign their names to public acts without a penalty of disappearance if you do not like their signatures. Make them bow before they speak. Make them call you office and clerk and Registrar and saint. Make them say please on paper. Count those pleases and tell your elders you still own a certain choreography. I will write the clause now. I will make it beautiful enough you can admire yourself in it. The Archive will wince and stamp it. It will save you embarrassment and buy the city time. This is not because I like you. This is because the aunties prefer eyes on the front of heads where they can be found.\u201d\n\nSevrin spoke to the veils, very low, and the veils replied by not moving. \u201cWe can sell them the theater of respect,\u201d he said, doing the arithmetic out loud so Mire could pretend someone else had added it. \u201cWe can force the children to wear gloves at our table. They will call it humiliation and swallow it because swallowing is survival. It gives us a list we can love. It gives them a shield they can hate. And while they hate it, they will organize. We will be less elegant. Kade will be alive. Our elders will learn to say the word calibration without choking. I recommend the purchase.\u201d\n\nThe elder with the silver band flicked a finger and somewhere in the ceiling a quill found the paper. \u201cYou do not recommend,\u201d they said, but they accepted the word. \u201cYou arranged this room. We disapprove of men who choreograph nights we think are ours. We will inventory your insolence later. For now, write deference where it will look best.\u201d\n\nI stepped down from the tray and took the stylus from the Countess before she could perform generosity. The slate accepted my hand with a reluctance I did not take personally. I wrote, slowly, because spectacle is a way to train a room to see the new outline of itself. The words were the sort that can be held by mouths that prefer not to bleed: petition, forum, address, courtesy. Underneath them, braided in a script the Archive taught me when I was young and vain about letters, I wove the teeth. No vanishing of registrants who meet the requirements of breath and bell. No confiscation of tongues licensed for deference. No extraction of anchors from families who choose to say the right new words loudly. I left myself an alley, and I left Kaia three, and I hid a door in a flourish no one but Edda would admire. When I handed the stylus back, the Countess took it as if accepting a knife she intended to use later and thanked me with a nod that was all wrists and no neck.\n\n\u201cThe Reconciliation,\u201d Mire said, and then, because he remembers to be read by other rooms later, \u201cSevrin.\u201d\n\nThis is how it was meant to go: the friend introduces the ritual that takes a piece of you and calls it medicine. Sevrin did not soften it. He never has. \u201cWe will perform the Counting of Names,\u201d he said, between teeth that did not show but could chew, \u201cand Kade will forget three things of ours and one thing of his own. We will not take a daughter\u2019s laugh. We are not interested in petty cruelty. We will take where he left us exposed. We will take something we can use and something we will not have to pretend to mourn. He may choose the shape of the forgetting. If he chooses poorly, I will choose. The Archive will witness, and the bear will be informed as if informing makes any difference to a creature who eats law as if it were the rind of a fruit.\u201d\n\nMy back went very cold then and it was not the braid, which had become a metronome fatigued by an orchestra. One of the elders above shifted and turned some small thing in their hand that made the very old dust think of bones. I thought of the drawer where my mother kept thread and needles and a little pair of scissors with birds for handles that had nipped my finger when I was seven because I had put the wrong thing under their beak. \u201cI choose,\u201d I said, because I have taught rooms like this that I prefer to swing my own axe. \u201cI forget where I threaded blood through the hands of the Old Taxes. I forget the tuning I used on the statutes around the Museum Quarter when we taught the cameras to see less. I forget the phrase that makes my name sit up and wag its tail when the Clock calls. That one is mine and it has been too useful to anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not get to take your favorite toy and hide it in your pillow,\u201d the Countess said lightly, and the elder with the silver band did not rebuke her because truth sometimes dresses like impudence to hold attention. \u201cWe will keep your answer, but you will not keep the last of those for yourself. We will decide who carries your tail.\u201d\n\nSevrin held out his hands as if receiving something that stung only decorum. \u201cI will hold the wag,\u201d he said, just the smallest grimace moving the corner of his mouth because he hates entertaining metaphors that make him ridiculous, \u201cand the rest we will let the Annex pin to a card. Kade, say the forgetting. Do not pronounce it like a charm. Pronounce it like a resignation letter. Leave yourself room to write again.\u201d\n\nThere is a tone you use when you quit, even if you intend to be rehired. I found it and spoke the three places and the one I loved. It is a clumsy thing to describe what it feels like to take a door out of your house while still living in it. The timbers groaned in memory more than in pain. I felt the place where the Old Taxes sing when certain children turn seven go dark to me, not to the world; I felt the Museum Quarter shrug and shutter its eyes; I felt the little trick with my name loosen like a thread cut and handed to a cat. The room did not change. I changed. The Archive made its small sound again, the one I had first learned to fear and then to admire. It registers. It does not sympathize. It writes How and When and leaves Why for meals with friends.\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d said the elder, and the veil downwards looked less like a curtain than like the inside of a mouth that has finally decided to swallow. \u201cHe is lighter by four lies and one truth. He will wobble like a table on an uneven floor until a woman with a folded napkin fixes him. We approve, provisionally. Kade,\u201d and the silver band flashed like a promise and a bruise, \u201cyou are free to leave this status. It will follow. It will watch. It will measure your appetite for afters. Do not come to our counters and ask for sugar. The aunties have it now, and we will behave as if we never did.\u201d\n\nThe Countess dipped her hand into the little glass bowl and touched a violet to her tongue, then made a face that told me they had been soaked in a brandy that had learned the wrong songs. \u201cWhat an unsatisfying stage kiss,\u201d she said, and then brightened, because she enjoys brightening the way cats enjoy watching things fall, \u201cbut I have a toy to unwrap later, and that will make for an excellent bedtime story. Sevrin, walk your friend out, or stand with him and let him pretend you are not escorting him. Either is acceptable. The rest of us will go and count how much of us is left and write a memo saying that the sum is unchanged because we have learned the trick of lying elegantly to ourselves. Mire, be kind to yourself when you read it. You are not a monster; you are a clerk with sharp teeth.\u201d\n\nMire did not acknowledge the indulgence. He stood finally, and when he stands you remember that he had a body once that did other things besides hold rules. \u201cTell your daughter,\u201d he said to me, not bothering to hide that the threat and the courtesy were wearing each other\u2019s coats, \u201cthat when she climbs she should check bolts the city did not put in. Tell the aunties we will bring oranges and not inspection papers if they do not make us say thank you. Tell the boy with the bell that luck is alliance. We do not lose today. We change category.\u201d\n\nOn the steps, the city knocked once, loudly, on a door with no name, and my braid answered with a small, offended thud. Sevrin put his hand under my elbow and I let him without telling him he was being sentimental. He did not take me back down the broad central stairs used by men who like to be seen managing their own descent. He took me along a corridor that narrowed itself with the eagerness of a gossip and came to a door that could never have been there yesterday. \u201cThey wanted to make you forget the Museum eyes,\u201d he said, and here his voice was only voice and not a blade. \u201cThey never knew where you stored the real entry to the feeds. When the day arrives where you hate them enough to break their own image on their own vizier-plates, use that. Not before. I cannot keep the ones behind me from becoming stupid if you hand them cause.\u201d\n\nWe took the new door and it deposited us under the colonnade again without the courtesy of stairs. The sky had developed a cut across it that a painter somewhere would declare a motif and a woman with a cart of bread declared out loud that she had run out because people who do not riot still need to chew. The boy with the bicycle rang his bell very carefully six times the way a man sets knives on a table when he is proud of not cutting anyone, and I nodded to him because there is no reason not to feed a creature who wants to be useful. Sevrin looked at my face the way a doctor used to look at a patient\u2019s tongue in the days when physicians were still permitted to claim they did not know. \u201cYou need to fall,\u201d he said, and I was tired enough to let the sentence be all the irony necessary.\n\n\u201cI have one more obligation,\u201d I said, because for once I had kept count. \u201cI promised to tell Auntie the bear has moved. I promised to bring her a piece of handless. I promised to teach my daughter how to make tea the way my mother failed to teach me because I wanted to pretend the water liked me more than it liked the pot. Then I will come when you whistle. Perhaps I will come before. Habits are leashes. Even when you put them down you can feel the tender wearing where they ran.\u201d\n\nHe did not ask me to be dramatic, and he did not ask me not to be. He touched my shoulder with the pressure he used to use on chess pieces before he learned to move the board without his hands. \u201cToday I will be grateful you are alive,\u201d he said, and he will hate that sentence later when he hears it in his own head with the tone of a boy who believes friendship is sacrament. \u201cTomorrow, I will behave as if you were my enemy badly behaved enough to be amusing. We will both pretend we are consistent. I will send my junior with a letter that looks like a grocery list. Answer it with what oranges cost. We must have something dull to show each other if the elders come to check.\u201d\n\nThe Bridge That Isn\u2019t understood that I had not chosen it. It sulked without dignifying itself with visible sulking, which is the only sulk a bridge can afford. I went to the door that lies instead and it opened because Ash has taught it to. The kitchen had moved three inches to the left the way a cat moves when it has decided to occupy a warmer patch of sun. Oranges sat where a bowl would be if we were the sort of people who bothered with bowls. The dog had claimed my chair and had to be persuaded with bread to vacate his right to my seat. Ash had drawn on the table with a stub of pencil some idea about which street ought to be stubborn on Thursdays, and she did not look up when I came in because she knew my weight and was busy loving a problem. Kaia stood by the stove with a kettle in her hand and not enough water and a frown you could hang a towel on.\n\n\u201cYou pour too fast,\u201d she said, and it was educational, not scorn. \u201cYou pour like a man paying a debt and you think the speed makes it nobler. It turns the leaves bitter. You have to give them a second to decide not to fight you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI left my best patience with someone else\u2019s mother,\u201d I said, and she rolled her eyes in the way that tells a parent their child is not becoming them, which is what anyone sensible wants. She adjusted the kettle and the sound of water changing its mind made the dog sigh and put his head on his paws because certain noises coax animals into remembering the old days before obedience was a job.\n\nSevrin\u2019s junior, a narrow person who looks like penmanship feels and who had once brought ferrisweet to my daughter and been forgiven for it because the sugar had been enough to make the iron tolerable, appeared in the doorway as if decorum had hung a coat on her. She held out a folded paper and kept her eyes down because the kitchen deserved that much respect. \u201cFrom Sevrin,\u201d she said, and the dog barked once as if to declare that all messages in this house must first be vetted by the old sciences.\n\nAsh took the paper and used it as a trivet because no one gets to be precious with their words under her roof. \u201cHe wants oranges,\u201d she said, skimming, and then threw me the glance I had earned by surviving to become useful. \u201cHe wants to know how many and from which stall and whether the woman who shouts at people she likes is there today. He is pretending this only matters because of a cook. You will answer, because we like men who admit to needing fruit.\u201d\n\nKaia poured the water as if she were being kind to it and I watched the leaves accept their fate and unfurl. \u201cYou will sleep,\u201d she said, and it was not an offer so much as an admission of victory. \u201cYou will snore because your body refuses to believe it is an instrument. You will wake up angry because you have trained your mouth to look for something to bite. You will consider sending me away, not because you think I cannot handle being bait but because you finally remembered what a daughter is for and you find yourself ashamed of wanting anything. We will ignore that part. We will eat bread. Auntie will tell a story about a bear who moved into a courthouse and made the clerks pick berries with their bare hands so they would understand the economy they were legislating. We will boil the first of your footnotes and feed it to the cat because he likes tough meat. Then you will go and do whatever it is you do when you want to call it law.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfterward,\u201d Ash said, and she did not look at the door, which is how you ask a city to be polite without telling it to be, \u201cwe will teach the dog to bite sleeves only. Necks are for later. We will teach Sevrin how to come into a kitchen without making the tea taste of marble. We will teach your elders that oranges do not come with receipts unless they are unworthy oranges. We will pin your shard-thing where it can frighten spiders. We will wait for the bell and refuse to wear our good aprons when we answer it.\u201d\n\nIt is astonishing how quickly a body that has argued with ceremony all day can decide to obey when ordered by hands that do not demand an oath. I sat, and the chair accepted me with the approval some furniture reserve for men who have managed to perform one decent trick before dying. I spread the paper and wrote what Sevrin had asked me to write about fruit with the attention one gives to subtle explosives. It is not the groceries that matter. It is the habit of asking. Kaia set the cup by my hand and I smelled the mint recognize the heat and become a better version of itself, and I wanted to weep because smell is the rudest door memory owns.\n\nI drank and the braid relaxed a fraction the way animals always forgive someone who has fed them. The city moved outside like something patient that has decided to lean. I let my head put itself down on my folded arm on the table that had learned to be a battlefield without being asked, and I practiced the most difficult jurisprudence of our time: I permitted other people to continue the defense without my mouth in the room. When I woke, the bell had found some new courage, and an orange sat on the window ledge with the sun pretending it had been there the whole time.",

The orange on the ledge had taught the window a color it could not quite pronounce, and the kettle startled itself into speech on the first try. I woke with the taste of mint turned forgiving on my tongue and the sense that my back had learned a new way to complain. The braid had settled lower during sleep, like a tenant who had discovered a warmer room, and it nipped when I turned my head because it preferred to be consulted about such things. The dog had chosen the door as his vocation and lay with his nose in the crack as if inhaling the best gossip. Ash had scratched a new map into the flour dust on the table, not as destination but as a reminder that even kitchens prefer to know how to get back to themselves.\n\nKaia did not say good morning because she does not say to the day what the day has not yet earned. She handed me bread and a knife and permission to pretend the crust fought back. When the slice finally lay obedient, she salted the butter without asking because some mercies should never require ceremony. We did our inventory the way people who have learned to survive do theirs, by pretending the list has been the same all along. Oranges, three, one with a bruise that made it sweeter. Needles, five, two already baptized in the part of me that dislikes baptism. String, as if a cat had taken on a second job. Time, enough to argue about the definition of enough and still put shoes on.\n\n\u201cYou snored,\u201d she said first, because praise is impolite and therefore too decadent to spend early. \u201cAuntie wanted to throw a spoon at you, but the dog convinced her the spoon had better uses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am collecting testimonies,\u201d I said, and cut the second piece of bread as if the knife had apologized. \u201cPerhaps I will write a pamphlet. \u2018What My Sleep Teaches Us About Law.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first chapter will be \u2018You Are Not As Quiet As You Think,\u2019\u201d Ash said without looking up from the tin where she was counting matches and lies with the equal tenderness of a woman who likes to have enough of both. \u201cThe second will be \u2018Close Your Mouth Before Your Teeth Collect the Wrong Story.\u2019 Put your elbows on the table and show me the damage.\u201d\n\nI obeyed because kitchens have ranked higher in my life than altars. The place where Kaia had planted the tollhouse had bruised to a purple that looked like a city choosing to wear its colors; the skin around it had learned to be dignified and was accordingly stiff. She tested the anchors with the sort of professional insult a radio learns to enjoy. The needles answered well. The braid pulsed once as if to show off and then allowed itself to be bullied into competence.\n\n\u201cIt will ask again,\u201d she said, with the professional pessimism of a woman who had made a living stealing speech back from stubborn machines. \u201cThings that learn they are wanted begin to get ideas. The weight on you wants to find the biggest stage and teach everyone what it knows. We will bore it. We will take it to errands and make it carry oranges with us until it learns to sit.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of errands,\u201d Ash cut in, and she had in her hand a folded piece of blue paper that had acquired grease on one corner and therefore legitimacy, \u201cSevrin sent his junior back with the names of three stalls where a man with a particular sort of pocket will be treated as if his coins are vegetables. He wants answers, and not poetry, about prices, and whether the woman at Kaina\u2019s steps still insults him for being born wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would insult the moon for having phases,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is her profession and our salvation. I will go with the junior and bargain with courtesy so you can say later that you saw me behave.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will go,\u201d Kaia said, \u201cbecause afterward they will drag you into a theater with a new sign on the door that reads Deference and you should enter first so other people know how to look expensive and still be improper. Eat your bread. The city will not wait for your stomach to finish bargaining.\u201d\n\nShe poured water as if gravity had taught her to be gentle in self-defense and the leaves mimed boats remembering they were forests. Auntie Knife watched us not like an audience but like a proprietor, and when I met her eye she let me see, for a sliver of a second, the part of her day where she goes quiet and counts all the people who can be safely sent to doors and all the doors that can be safely opened. No one appreciates the mathematics of safety until they have had to multiply it by hunger.\n\nWe left with the dog\u2019s blessing and without thanks to the door because gratitude is a kind of advertisement. The junior walked half a step behind us with the entitled misery of someone who has been told not to be seen and dislikes being reminded that invisibility is not an art she chose. She led with competence. The yards smelled of oil that had learned a new song and the river practiced being a straight line until a barge taught it to be reasonable. The city had dressed its wounds to look like jewelry, which is one way to keep your enemies guessing where to cut.\n\nKaina\u2019s steps hosted the same dynasty as last year: the same women with different faces, the same jokes with better timing, the same coins stacking themselves into small towers that wanted to see something. The orange seller insulted us on sight and then relented sufficiently to twist humor into discount; she called Sevrin a velvet knife and apologized for insulting knives by association. We bought cheap and paid dear and left ten words we wanted carried to ears that prefer the market to the Archive. That is how you ensure any law grows: you teach it to gossip.\n\nThe boy with the bicycle appeared without having the decency to look like summons. He rang the bell three careful times and jerked his head toward the old auditorium that had acquired a new vocabulary overnight. He did not wait to see if we followed. He has decided he\u2019s a fate; fates never look back because they are bad at regret.\n\nThe stage had not changed. The words over it had. A canvas hung there awkwardly, as if the room had tried on clothes in front of a mirror that still loved another shape. Deference was stenciled in a font someone had decided meant stability and kindness to grandmothers. People read with their mouths sometimes, in this city, and as each mouth tried the syllables the sound gained a scuff you could use to stop a sliding chair. The Night had posted three clerks and one agent who did not wear the air but wore a look that told it when to move. The Countess stood like a tax on the left and did not pretend to be uninterested. Mire refused to exist in public but had a line of chalk leading away at an angle that promised he could be in the room in thirty seconds without passing a door. Sevrin semaphored boredom from a shadow because he knows what his face does to crowds and refused to spend it mid-morning.\n\nThe first to kneel were the ones with knees that understood the floor. They made a show of not cracking. They unfolded pleas like linen saved for guests who did not come. It was ugly in the way training is ugly when watched, and beautiful in the way a first breath counts even when it is taken for the wrong reason. The deference clause did what I had written it to do: it tied their mouths to breath to visible fog, it made the bell a witness because the bell had taken an interest, it forced the Night to stand like furniture and endure compliments from people they would have preferred to inventory. The clause has a taste when it works. It tastes like a copper coin a child believes to be chocolate because it glows. I dislike that I love that taste. I am allowed to be complicated in my pleasures; I am an adult.\n\nKaia did not kneel. She took the panel that reproduced speech and taught it to be less dignified. She widened the lower frequencies, the ones that usually tell your gut how to feel, and allowed them to ring when the petitioners said please. You should hear what a city does when you make it listen to the word please with its stomach. Men in suits slope their shoulders. Agents of any kind step with their toes instead of their heels. Countesses examine their nails for faults that did not exist this morning. It is obscene how fast etiquette can be weaponized when you return it to people who have never been allowed to like it.\n\nThe Countess did the thing she had promised herself she would do with ribbons. She waited until a pause, then approached Kaia\u2019s left side with a selection of silk and a voice like sympathy holding a needle. She did not offer anything that could be called clothing because she does not insult competence with costumes. She offered ties for cables, loops for tools, a handkerchief to prevent the panel\u2019s teeth from making the hand that feeds it bleed. She complimented like a duet. She offered nothing but convenience and let affection be the trick people inflicted on themselves.\n\nKaia selected the ties that would not fray and declined the handkerchief without making a point of the blood. She took the loop and turned it over twice and tied it in a knot only someone who had taken apart a radio could call graceful. She said thank you to the silk as if silk could be grateful and did not say it to the woman representing polished cruelty. The Countess made the face respectable predators make when told a child has learned to tie her shoes. She had intended to leave a hook in the knot. Kaia left a bell. If the hook was pulled by the wrong hand, the bell would ring in a language that silk understands, and some day the Countess would try to use what she had given and be surprised at the sound her gift made when warned.\n\nThere is theater, and then there is a kitchen, and on certain days the first tries so hard to be the second that both blush. At the fourth petitioner the bell rang at the wrong time and counted fifteen because a man in the back raised his hand without asking permission. The clause flexed where I had written it to forgive that impertinence; the handless face at the Observatory turned its attention to the auditorium as a person does when a word they used to love passes in the mouth of a stranger; Miracles were not invited, and did not arrive, which is always my favorite outcome.\n\nThe bear arrived in a different room entirely. You do not look at her. She looks at you. The courthouse, which does not often get to be a set for stories that remember joy, allowed the aunties to bring the bucket with its lid and a spoon that had learned manners at wakes. The clerks disliked being used as props, which is why they made such excellent props. Somewhere between the door and the first desk the bucket seemed heavier. Somewhere between the second desk and the bench the smell of honey acquired a smell of law. Aunties do not invoke animals. They demonstrate them. Ash stood halfway back in the gallery with a spool of twine in her pocket and a smile that a sensible child would be born knowing to avoid. She shook the tin that used to hold biscuits and now held my shard with the train ticket and a lemon and three paper clips because the city respects substitutes. When the judge attempted to stand, the chair refused to let him in quite the way he preferred. The aunties called out, cheerfully, for hats, and clerks who had stopped wanting to be useful the day they first used ink found themselves carrying honey on the brims of their pride. If you think humiliation and justice should never be arranged to keep one another in humor, you have never had to teach an institution to share. The bear\u2019s paw sat itself on the docket. The docket got sticky. No one in that room would say bear. Everyone would say honey for a month, and in that month every time a form asked for a signature, someone would think of sticking their fingers into a sweetness that made their mouths less polite. Law tastes better after it has been allowed to eat what it wants.\n\nThe auditorium breathed its way through three dozen petitions. People said please and the Night wrote down the shape of their lips and pretended not to keep count. Two men asked for their bakery to be permitted to sell bread at night without the tithe; the calibration spider Sevrin had spun for us already twitched and hauled up a corner of a notice as if letting sunlight in were regard for health. A woman asked that the copied songs that had been banned for their improper watermarks be permitted to play at weddings during the vow and the first dance only. I permitted myself to admire that one because it balanced defiance with superstition in a way that would embarrass the Registry into pretending it had agreed days before. A child whose hair had decided to become ungovernable asked if the bicycle bell could be hung in the amphitheater and counted as witness even when the bicycle had decided to go somewhere else. We wrote it down and we made it so because arguments with children who have rewritten sound are unbecoming in any room.\n\nThey let me speak last, which was a courtesy and a trap. They wanted the taste of law on their tongue when they left as if it were a mint to cleanse the palate, and they wanted to be able to tell the elders they had boxed my words in at the end as if language were a neighbor too loud after midnight and we could call a man with a badge. I chose to thank the bell because it understands gratitude better than men, and then I thanked the people for teaching please the taste of their breath, and then I used the time I had left to name, quietly enough to make the clerk with the beautiful handwriting work for it, all the things anyone should never have to ask permission for again. You cannot legislate mercy without making pornographers of angels. You can inventory rudeness and decide to like it. The Countess let the stylus hover over the slate as if it were a ladybird she didn\u2019t want to scare. She looked bored. Men who like to pretend they do not answer to women do not read correctly the posture in her back when she is about to do math in public.\n\nI stepped off the stage and the braid bit my lower ribs as if reminding me it preferred me to stay in rooms where it could watch to see if its work was admired. Kaia\u2019s hand found the topmost needle and gave it a piratical twist that told it to be quiet in words too short for music. The needle behaved. Sevrin\u2019s shadow detached itself from the wall because it had grown tired of pretending it belonged to the paint. He walked beside me without putting his hand on my arm, which in our dialect is permission to decide whether to ask. \u201cYour clause did not bore,\u201d he said. \u201cThe elders will forgive you three times before they admit you impressed them. That should get you through lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am attempting to wean myself from being interesting,\u201d I said. \u201cIt has made too much trouble for my friends. How was your bear?\u201d\n\n\u201cMiserable,\u201d he said, and there might have been a smile if he had been alone. \u201cMy clerks are sticky. My judge has learned how far the brim of his hat may be trusted, which is further than he had supposed. I am told by a woman who terrifies me without trying that oranges will be brought to the Aunties without anyone attempting to weigh the mesh bags they come in. I am to deliver the bags. I am to remember to say please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will look excellent with the right sort of citrus under your arm,\u201d I said. \u201cIt will distract people from your Latin.\u201d\n\nHe glanced at Kaia as if checking the weather and found a storm he had not prepared for. It is a peculiar experience to watch an old friend fall in love with a different category of courage. \u201cThe Countess will come for her again,\u201d he said, not as warning and not as promise. \u201cShe has found a place in the silk that does not itch, and she will imagine herself gentle. Do you want me to tell her a story that embarrasses her about plums and daughters and the way some men think food is affection and some women do too?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her,\u201d Kaia answered, before I could, because she would not be fathered in rooms where the air had learned her weight, \u201cthat if she brings ribbon I will use it to tie her shoes. Tell her to bend down in my street to fix the knot. Tell her to discover what she sees when she tries to put polite into the gutter.\u201d\n\nHe bowed a fraction of an inch because sarcasm raises deference when delivered well, and then he was gone because the Registry does not wait for men to finish their epigrams. The auditorium folded itself back into a room with a raised speech and a floor that needs sanding. People drifted toward errands. The bell gave itself one last ring and then behaved like an adult. The boy rode past and managed to make speed look philosophical. We stood in the new category of shade available to citizens who have survived a morning.\n\nIn the afternoon the Archive coughed. It was a little sound, like a clerk clearing his throat for someone he likes and doesn\u2019t know how to ask to tea. Edda had sent a child, not the bicycle, but the slow breed who carry words like soup. He came to the kitchen door with his cap folded in his hands and the look of someone who has been told a secret and is dying to be responsible about it. \u201cMissus Edda says her pages itch,\u201d he reported, as if my entire job were to be the man with the ointment. \u201cShe says you left too much of yourself in a margin and now a girl with good penmanship is having dreams about your footnotes. She says that is not hygienic.\u201d\n\nI went because it is good manners to answer your own mess. Kaia came with me because the Archive had learned her smell yesterday and would be less inclined to kick. Ash declined because kitchens must be defended from sudden visitors with nice pens. The walk to the annex was shorter than it had been because I could not be made to get lost properly in halls I had taught to lie, and Edda met us at the vestibule as if we were bread she had been waiting to take out of her oven. She looked at me in that way only elderly women are permitted, half insult and half absolution, and then took my wrist as if checking for a pulse and consenting to find disappointment lovely.\n\n\u201cYou put romance in a statute,\u201d she said, not admiring and not cruel. \u201cThe girl who copies the nice hand got a poem in her soup. She doesn\u2019t need that. You may be handsome in your own head, but you are not for girls writing receipts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not intend\u2014\u201d I began, and she cut me with a chin.\n\n\u201cOf course you did not. No one intends the angles of their handwriting to become a lesson for someone else\u2019s body. This is why we have aunties and doorways and the nice habit of brooms. Come in and root yourself. Take back the flourish you did not need. Leave us the teeth.\u201d\n\nIt was the oddest sensation, to reach into a letter that had laughed and extract the part that had wanted to be pretty while punishing itself for not being loved enough. The clause sat in my hand for a moment like a cat you think purrs for you and actually purrs for the way your neighbor whistles. Kaia watched my hand and Edda watched our faces and the Archive purred with visible pride because books know when they have stopped distracting and started counting again. The girl with the pen looked up once and I smiled at her like a man who never tries to be anyone\u2019s poem. She went back to her lines. She has better pursuits than my sentences.\n\nWhen we came back to air, the city had decided to pretend to be calm. That is often when cruelty feels most comfortable showing up with a basket of fruit. Vale\u2019s lieutenant, the one with the scar that had never put on enough lipstick to convince anyone it liked being looked at, did not arrive. The hole she left had the exact shape of effort. It shocked me that the Night would choose to take something as minor as a lieutenant when the city expected them to snatch something that glittered more. It then made sense, because petty kidnaps do better work than elegant ones when your goal is to teach the habit of fear. I have survived too long by reading their pettiness as devotion. I felt my jaw ache in places I do not enjoy remembering I own.\n\n\u201cDo not rush it,\u201d Ash said when I got as far as the door and stopped as if ropes had remembered me. \u201cThey took that woman because she is the kind who buys bread in five loaves and shares three and then teaches someone else how to make the other two last until Thursday. They will expect you to admire the courage of retribution and hurry into the spot where their trap can eat you on camera. In another hour they will decide whether to deference their own theft and make a speech about safety. We will preempt them. We will write the courtesy they crave and make it read like scorn.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow,\u201d Kaia said, not because she doubted, but because the question is our family recipe. \u201cWhere. When.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the quiet part of the river ward where tutelage lives in stairwells,\u201d Ash said, which is a very auntie way of saying by the school opposite the laundry where little boys learn to recycle laces. \u201cWe will convene a Parish Deference. It is not in the clauses. It is in the city. The bell will not be necessary because the kettle will do. The mouth will declare itself by saying good evening to twenty-three windows. The handless face will look because a child will hold up a broken clock. They took a woman who trains other people\u2019s breath. We will make them bring her back by making breath an expense they can\u2019t afford to waste today.\u201d\n\nWe spent an hour doing things that do not look like resistance and therefore matter. We sent a boy who keeps a list of spoons to tap on doors the exact number of times that makes polite look like code. We borrowed three chairs and called them pews so people who had not entered a church since the city stopped believing in that sort of devotions could feel at home. We told the dog that tonight, he would bark once, and only once, when the first vampire attended disguised as a rich woman. He practiced. He took it very seriously. We taught a kettle to wheeze at the right pitch. We asked Edda to send us a cord that looked like a ribbon so that if the Countess tried to be generous later we could make her feel late. We arranged oranges on a windowsill as if sorting prayers into edibles and left one mistaken on purpose because some mistakes are invitations.\n\nThe Parish Deference began where any good story does, with one old woman telling another to be quiet or be useful. The kettle announced itself. The mouths said good evening in a way that made the wall write down where it had been spoken. Children carried chairs with the solemnity of professional mourners at a wedding. The first petitioner was a man who has never not undercut his own height by apologizing for it, and we made him stand under a lintel that did not demand his head bow, and he learned something about pride that it can take a body forty years to remember it owns. The second was a woman who wanted to know if she could write her son\u2019s name where the Registry would normally write an inventory number, and we told her no, because his name is not a label, but yes, because the wall that holds the Parish Deference will take that name and keep it better than paper. The third was a child who asked if the bear liked plum jam, and we said only if the judge brings it.\n\nWe had not reached twenty-three when the Night arrived, and it did not arrive in silk. It arrived in sleeves rolled to the elbows and a look that wanted to be called weary by men who write editorials and prefer to pretend that violence is interrupting someone else\u2019s administration. The agent who had adjusted his cuffs at the yards now came without cuffs and with hands that held a hat too politely. He said he was there to listen. He stood where he could not help but hear. He waited for the word please and gave it the sort of attention men reserve for women with whose names they have decided to fall in love.\n\n\u201cWe want your lieutenant returned,\u201d I said, when he had tried listing to be decent and the Parish had been decent back at him. \u201cWe want her hands returned with her. We want an apology for wasting work. The city is tired of training. It would prefer to be trained.\u201d\n\nHe played the new game as if he hadn\u2019t practiced all morning. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said, and he meant it, because he cannot help but love rehearsals in which the other actor knows his lines. \u201cPlease accept that we have procedures. Please do not name individuals. Please return to the Forum tomorrow with an appropriate petition and we will\u2014\u201d\n\nKaia cut him off with the luxury she affords only people who have shown themselves unable to build their own tools. \u201cWe are the forum tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cThis wall remembers better than your slate. This kettle calls witnesses you do not own. The Observatory has assigned an eye to our street because a boy has decided to be rude with a clock he stole and we have decided to praise him for it. Bring me the woman with the cleft in her lip and the habit of sending children to bed with two kinds of stories, one about hunger and one about mathematics. Bring her without folding her into paperwork that will later make her think she was wrong to teach the difference.\u201d\n\nThe agent looked to where he thought his chalk line might connect him to Mire\u2019s listening. He found no chalk because the Aunties had swept, and he disliked how clean the doorway felt. He left because men like him prefer to promise rather than to be seen failing. We waited. We told three more stories and one long joke about bees in a jar that the dog ruined by barking at the wrong time because he wanted to be included. We practiced deference badly, which is the first correct version of any good habit. We lined our mouths with courtesy and used it to make insults taste like instructions. We refused to let anyone\u2019s eyes practice crying. After thirty minutes in which I learned how to stand without counting, they returned the lieutenant.\n\nShe walked like paper learning not to tear when folded. Her eyes were the opposite of wine. We did not cheer because cheering is what you do when someone wins a thing. We made room for her body. We put the chair that had pretended to be a pew under her hands so she could own something that had just learned how to be furniture. We did not ask questions in public and she did not answer any. Later, she and Ash would inventory the damages. Later, a bear would sit in a different room and lick a clerk\u2019s fingers clean of honey. For now the Parish gave her its breath by breathing in and not out until she remembered how to do the second part. If we have invented a better method for telling people they are welcome and expected to be difficult, I have not read it.\n\nWe let the Night watch us watching ourselves. The agent took off his hat and did not know what to do with it because the heads of men like him have learned to balance crowns that do not exist. He looked at me as if asking me to take a portion of his culpability and store it in a drawer he could pretend he did not own. I dislike drawers. I nodded as if I had promised to consider it. There will come a day when he is useful. I will let it hurt him.\n\nAfterward, when the oranges were eaten by accident and on purpose and the chairs returned to the parts of rooms that had missed them, Kaia and I walked the long way home because the braid had decided that if it was not made to carry a speech it would be content to carry the quiet. The handless face looked toward us without moving. We passed the Bridge that Isn\u2019t and did not flatter it with an explanation. A woman in a window shook a rug into the evening and made the dust look like a ceremony to which someone had forgotten to send invitations. Sevrin\u2019s junior trailed with the efficient attention of someone whose body has learned to be furniture and wants promotion. The dog ran ahead to chase nothing because sometimes you need to relieve the evening of all its dignity.\n\n\u201cI will teach you hinges,\u201d I told Kaia because fathers born too late are forced to speak in metaphors to feel less guilty about absence. \u201cThe kind that pretend to be decoration and hold doors honest. The kind that squeak at a particular note when the wrong person attempts to make them behave. The kind that turn a drawer into a letter and a letter into a room. My mother taught me nothing about bread, but she taught me to listen to the way a cupboard gives way when it is tired of holding secrets.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know those hinges,\u201d she said, without cruelty, because the best way to forgive a man is to let him imagine he is teaching you. \u201cI want the ones that fold time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ones that fold time require a boy with a bell and a woman with a handkerchief who does not apologize for it,\u201d I said. \u201cWe will borrow them. You will steal them. You will not let your aunt put them by the stove where the heat will undo the cleverness. We will make the city do origami so good that even the vampires admire the crease.\u201d\n\nWe climbed the stairs to the door that lies and, inside, the kitchen had done us the service of becoming boring. The table was a table and not a map. The kettle was an instrument and not a witness. The matches were simply wood waiting for rough treatment that would make them useful. Ash had fallen asleep in her chair with her head on her arm and her hand curled around the tin so that even her dreams could not be trusted not to protect us. The lieutenant had a quilt across her knees and a smear of honey on her upper lip that she had not noticed and would, later, find indecent enough to make her laugh until the dog corrected her for forgetting to pat him.\n\nI set the handless shard on the windowsill beside the orange and a new object that might have been a gear or a bribe or a joke. I did not say I was grateful because gratitude is loud and people were sleeping. I allowed my back to have ideas about chairs. The braid purred like an animal discovering its own stupid capacity for affection. The city turned in its sleep and did not bite. And when the bell chose to ring again, from far away where a boy had decided luck was not an animal you could train but a gate you could oil until it swung for anyone, I did not stand. I lay my hand flat on the table to feel the grain remember it had been trees, and I called that jurisprudence for the day because the law had eaten too much honey to ruin it with words.",
