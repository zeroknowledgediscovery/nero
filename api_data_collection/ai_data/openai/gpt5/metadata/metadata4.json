     "novel_text": "The morning the email arrived, the sky over Red Deer was the kind of washed-out, winter-blue that never decides if it\u2019s going to be gentle or cruel. I was at my usual table near the window of the caf\u00e9 on Ross Street, wearing the sweater with the missing elbow patch and pretending to edit chapter twelve of a novel I hadn\u2019t confessed to anyone I was writing. The steam from my Americano kept fogging my glasses and clearing again, like breath on glass. Like someone was trying to say something and I kept missing it.\n\nA ping, then another. I almost ignored it. The last three pings had been reminders from my landlord that the snow needed clearing in the alley behind the house. When the subject line resolved, my hands went cold, and then hot as if I\u2019d knocked over the cup in my head.\n\nFinalist confirmation.\n\nI clicked.\n\n\u201cDear Ms. Lumen,\u201d the message read. The producers never got used to my pen name, and neither had I, despite the fact that it was printed on the covers of two books and stapled to the front of the manuscript glowering at me from my bag. \u201cWe are delighted to confirm your place in the Maple Hearth final this Saturday at the Stampede Park Pavilion in Calgary. Call time is 6:00 AM. Please bring at least two aprons and any specialty equipment. Congratulations, and break an egg!\u201d\n\nI read it twice, then once more out loud, which prompted a glance from the barista, who had bright green hair and a nose piercing that sparkled like a tiny snowflake.\n\n\u201cGood news?\u201d she asked, wiping a clean mug that didn\u2019t need wiping.\n\nI held up my phone, the email bright and impossible. \u201cFinal. I\u2019m in the final.\u201d\n\nShe tilted her head, trying to remember what I\u2019d told her on a different day when I was a different person. She snapped her fingers. \u201cMaple Hearth? The baking show? Oh, that\u2019s huge. You\u2019re going to be famous-famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.\u201d I laughed, the sound coming out wrong, like a scratched record. It felt like the part of my life that had always been quiet and interior\u2014words spread out across pages, the secret fellowship of butter and sugar in the bowl\u2014was suddenly going to be witnessed. Burnished under bright lights. Measured. Judged.\n\nI texted my sister.\n\nIt was our shorthand. Jill was a paramedic; everything in our family was triage, crisis, and how we reset when the sirens were turned off.\n\nShe replied instantly, as if she\u2019d been waiting. I had the sense sometimes that Jill stood ready for me just to tip, with a stretcher and a blanket and tea in a thermos.\n\nI felt the table shake and realized it was my knees. Something inside me had always believed I was an almost, someone who came mildly close to good things and collected them in a box to take out later, when the room was empty.\n\n\u201cCareful,\u201d the barista said. \u201cWe can put some tape under one of the legs. Or, you know, you could just breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d I said, and then inhaled, slow, counting to four, to six, to eight like the therapist with the cinnamon tea had taught me. The panic receded, a tide that hadn\u2019t decided on its own mind. \u201cI should buy a second apron.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should buy five,\u201d she said. \u201cOne for each camera. One to throw at the judge if he tells you your crust is soggy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoggy is the worst,\u201d I agreed. The email felt heavy in my palm, and light, and then heavy again.\n\nOn my way home through Waskasoo Park, the snow bled quietly into the river and the geese watched me like judges who\u2019d seen everyone\u2019s practice bakes. My house was a small blue square with a porch that sloped as if it was listening. Inside, the air was a familiar mix of yeast, paper, and the lavender oil I dabbed under my wrists when I couldn\u2019t sleep. My kitchen looked like it had tried and failed to become a cookbook photo: bowls stacked on the butcher block, a jar of sourdough starter that sometimes behaved and sometimes sulked, a wooden spoon with a bite taken out of it by an old dog I didn\u2019t own anymore.\n\nI called Jill. She picked up in the middle of a siren. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, shouting over something that sounded important. \u201cI saw the text. I\u2019ll call you back in twenty.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d I started and stopped. The silence between us was never empty. It was full of the things we chose not to say when we couldn\u2019t see each other\u2019s faces. \u201cDo you think Dad would\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty,\u201d she said again, then, softer: \u201cBreathe.\u201d\n\nI set the phone down and did what I always do when news\u2014good or bad\u2014arrives. I took out a recipe that didn\u2019t need me to be anyone except someone who could follow instructions. I sifted flour and pretended not to notice the parts of me that like to go missing. I cut butter into flour and pretended not to notice the ache in my head that had lived there since last spring, like a tenant who\u2019d lost the lease and refused to leave.\n\nThe neurologist had a name for it that sounded like rain against the window. Transient global amnesia. It made my mouth dry, the way Latin words sometimes do when they name a thing you thought was yours alone. I\u2019d lost days. Whole weeks were a soft blur that smelled like hospital antiseptic and someone else's perfume. I\u2019d woken up in May with a ribbon tied around my wrist and a scar on my forehead and Jill making scrambled eggs at my stove as if we were kids again. \u201cYou should stop bumping into things,\u201d she\u2019d said, trying to sound breezy and failing.\n\n\u201cWhat things?\u201d I had asked, and she had smiled with her teeth and not her eyes. \u201cLife,\u201d she said, like a joke.\n\nI made pie dough because it\u2019s what my hands knew. I worked fast, slicing the butter into little moons, their edges softening under my warm fingers. I grated a stick, because grating butter makes it listen better. I told the dough to stay flaky, and it mostly did. While it rested in the fridge like a pet that needs its cage covered to sleep, I rolled my shoulders and tried to recall every step that had taken me to that email.\n\nAuditions. Signature bakes. The technical where I\u2019d misread the judge\u2019s handwriting and added salt twice. I\u2019d laughed, and the judge with the silver hair had lifted one eyebrow, the slash that had launched a thousand GIFs, and said, \u201cBold.\u201d\n\nThe other contestants had been good. Better than good. There was a woman from Moose Jaw who made eclairs shaped like the Qu\u2019Appelle River and glazed them with Saskatoon berry jam until they gleamed. There was a man from Nanaimo who knew seven different ways to make a Nanaimo bar and looked offended if anyone suggested eight. There was a quiet, careful boy who piped meringue as if it were a blessing and not a sugar froth. And then there was me, a writer who liked the lyric structure of recipes. Someone who didn\u2019t mind that rules could hold beauty.\n\nI\u2019d committed to the show like I commit to most things: with unnecessary intensity and a small voice in my head saying, You\u2019re pretending, you\u2019re playing a part. That voice had fallen quieter each time I slid something onto the gingham-checked table and handed it to the cameras and nobody laughed.\n\nI rolled the dough out and made cut-outs in the shape of maple leaves, because maple leaves look smug and I wanted some of that smugness. I filled the pie with apples I\u2019d peeled and macerated in brown sugar and lemon juice, the sauce thick and glossy and nearly obscene. \u201cTaste,\u201d I told myself, and touched a finger to the syrup, pressing it against the roof of my mouth like a hiding place.\n\nYou\u2019re in the final. Those words would not stop being a joke. They would not stop splitting into their halves and rearranging themselves. You\u2019re in. The final. Final in. In the final. The email sitting heavy on my counter like a guest who couldn\u2019t take a hint.\n\nI folded the edges of the dough and let them overlap, like sweaters. This is how my grandmother showed me. She\u2019d grown up not far from here, on a farm where the winter lasted nine months and the other three were a rumor. She had never written a book but she\u2019d known how to make a whole room quiet by putting a pie on the table. She used to say, \u201cFood is the story you tell that people will eat.\u201d\n\nI was telling my stories with words that day because it\u2019s what I knew. When the timer went off and the kitchen was thick with sugar scent, I shut the oven and turned my face into the heat. It fogged my lashes and I closed my eyes, and when I did something bright and stumbled flickered through my head like the end of a reel. Glitter? Confetti? No, that\u2019s ridiculous; I don\u2019t go to parties. My scalp prickled. The part of my head that sometimes reached for missing months did an odd pause, like someone slipping on ice but catching themselves on a fence post.\n\nI wrote the words: maple-apple, Earl Grey custard, dacquoise, lemon curd. I wrote them in my small green notebook in the voice I used when I wasn\u2019t writing for anyone else. Then, in a corner of the page, I wrote, Do not oversteep. Be kind to the eggs. Remember to breathe.\n\nJill called me back as I was dusting powdered sugar across the maple leaves. \u201cTell me you\u2019ll let me come with you,\u201d she said, in the voice she saved for asking to be told yes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only Calgary,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get bored if you don\u2019t let me come. I\u2019ve got forty-eight hours off, and I\u2019m not spending them in front of the TV watching you and shouting corrections at the screen.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrections like what?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, don\u2019t forget the sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never forget the sugar,\u201d I said, and then laughed because it wasn\u2019t true. I forget all kinds of things. \u201cI have to be there at six.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can drive us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave the city at four-thirty. I\u2019ll set three alarms. Also, I\u2019m very good at reminding people to breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI noticed,\u201d I said. \u201cYes. Come.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, then the sound of her chewing what I knew was gum because she didn\u2019t smoke and needed something to put between herself and the world. \u201cAnd how\u2019s your head?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d I lied. Or didn\u2019t. The pain was a gentle weight today, nothing like the strange electric storms of last summer. I could live like this, I thought. I had, after all. \u201cI slept. I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dreamed,\u201d I said. \u201cSomething with\u2026 gold paper? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have real gold paper on Saturday,\u201d Jill said. \u201cConfetti. They blast it from cannons. I saw it on TV last year. It gets in everybody\u2019s hair. Even the judge looked like a New Year\u2019s decoration.\u201d\n\nI pressed the phone tighter to my ear. \u201cLast year?\u201d I asked, too quickly. \u201cYou watched last year?\u201d\n\n\u201cI watch every year. You were the one who refused to watch with me because the judge\u2019s voice gave you hives.\u201d A pause. \u201cAnyway. The final\u2019s always ridiculous. The challenges are over the top. No one\u2019s skin doesn\u2019t break. Every crust tears. They cry and then they win and then they cry harder.\u201d\n\nA door in the back of my head creaked and I pushed it shut. \u201cMaple Hearth is gentle,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re nice to people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re nice,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut the oven is not. Heat is heat.\u201d Her voice softened again. \u201cHey, be careful. Don\u2019t accept food from strangers. That show is cut-throat. I read something online about sabotages.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the American ones,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is Canada.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are people, with or without maple syrup,\u201d she said. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll keep an eye on your cup.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise,\u201d I said, even while thinking that Jill had started to sound like our mother, and that disconcerted me. Our mother who taught me to write and Jill to run and both of us to keep our tempers to ourselves. Our mother whose absence was a shape in our house we navigated around, like the ottoman you always forget is in the middle of the room until you stub your shin on it in the dark.\n\nBy Friday night the hotel in Calgary was as glossy and impersonal as a pastry glaze. There was a chandelier in the lobby that looked like a constellation had fallen down and decided to roost. People in suits and polished boots moved through the light and swallowed their reflections whole. I felt ungainly with my tote bags and my flour-dusted coat and my green notebook peeking out as if it wanted to see what a five-star sink looked like.\n\nThe woman at the front desk had a mouth like a slash of lipstick and hair like a crow\u2019s wing. \u201cWelcome,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo doubles, right? Lumen.\u201d She looked at me as if I were someone. She looked again, like the light had briefly misled her. \u201cAre you in town for\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWork,\u201d I said. I was always briefer when people asked me to define my life. Work. Writing. A thing with eggs.\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d She handed me an envelope with my name typed neatly on it. \u201cYou have a note,\u201d she said, and then leaned closer in a way she probably practiced in the mirror. \u201cGood luck tomorrow. The right people will be watching.\u201d\n\nI took the envelope to the corner by the fake fireplace and opened it. The paper had weight. The handwriting fooled me at first, too careful to be familiar. It said, simply: Remember.\n\n\u201cCreepy,\u201d Jill said, peering over my shoulder. \u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea.\u201d I looked for a signature, an initial, a flourish. Nothing. I wanted it to be from me, from another version of me who had the grace to think ahead. I wanted to have mailed myself a talisman, knowing I\u2019d need it. Memory was not a sure thing. It was a lake with thin ice in places I couldn\u2019t map.\n\n\u201cFree breakfast,\u201d Jill said, reading the pamphlet on the table. \u201cFrom six to nine. Fruit, cereal, pastries, eggs. You should have eggs. Slow proteins, so you don\u2019t crash.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never crash,\u201d I said, rolling my neck. \u201cI idle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you,\u201d she said, and kissed the top of my head. \u201cWe\u2019re setting three alarms. And we\u2019re going to practice that stunner you\u2019re making tomorrow. What is it again? Rhubarb and chokecherry mousse inside a praline cage? That thing that makes the judge cry?\u201d\n\n\u201cDacquoise,\u201d I said. \u201cMaple walnut dacquoise with chokecherry reduction and rhubarb mousse. And a cage, yes. If my hands behave. I did it once last week and it held. It was beautiful. It should have had a parade.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will get one,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the shape of applause.\u201d\n\nWe went upstairs. The elevators were mirrored, which meant I had to look at my face next to Jill\u2019s and admit we were sisters. She wore competence like jewelry. I wore it like a coat I\u2019d borrowed from someone taller. In the room, I lined up my things on the desk like talismans. Apron, apron. Piping tips, offset spatula, a whisk that had seen some things. Notebook, pen. Lavender oil, the small bottle, in case the dream with the gold paper came back and chased me down the hall.\n\nAt two in the morning I woke with my fingers aching. The ache has the shape of a memory sometimes, like the body remembering what the mind declines. I cradled my hands under the faucet and ran warm water over them and thought of the way sugar threads crystallize into lattices you can\u2019t see with the naked eye. I turned back the covers and lay awake while the city murmured. Somewhere in the hotel a door shut and then opened again. Somewhere a laugh bubbled up and then clamped down, embarrassed to exist. I put the note from the desk drawer under my pillow. Remember.\n\nAt five I was up, hair braided, the world creaking awake in blue-gray. Jill made coffee with the machine that burped and sighed like an old cat. We went down to the breakfast room, which smelled like toast and ambition. Other people in track suits and suits and tourism hoodies ate with the urgency of people who might not get a chance later. At one end a man in a chef\u2019s jacket introduced his pancake to a pool of syrup so wide I had to look away.\n\n\u201cEggs,\u201d Jill said, pointing at the chafing dish like a general. \u201cToast. Fruit. No pastries. No trying something new. Your stomach hates new.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy stomach is adventurous,\u201d I said, and picked up a piece of melon that tasted exactly like damp.\n\nI found a table near the window and put my plate down and then, because my hands needed to be doing something, I went to get a second cup of coffee. When I came back, the orange juice I hadn\u2019t poured was waiting for me, a twin to the ones at every other table, thin skin of foam, tiny beads of condensation like pearls. The print on the glass said, in cheery script: Good Morning, Calgary!\n\nJill returned from the food with a look like she\u2019d just had to extinguish a small fire. \u201cI told the guy with the ladle to put the ladle back in. You can\u2019t leave it on the counter like that. It\u2019s chaos.\u201d She sat. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\u201cJuice,\u201d I said, pointing. \u201cThey delivered juice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t doing sugar before noon,\u201d she said, but her voice was teasing, not stern. I shrugged and lifted the glass and drank, because I was thirsty and also because the juice looked very much like the kind of good thing that might want to be wasted if it wasn\u2019t consumed quickly.\n\nIt was cold and sweet and a little bit bitter. It tasted like childhood and the first day back at school. It tasted like being out of time and out of place. It tasted, one second later, wrong.\n\nMy mouth prickled. Some wrongness crawled over my tongue and down my throat with polite shoes. I put the glass down and the clink sounded further away than it should have. The walls of the room leaned. The carpet, which was patterned with cheerful hexagons, did a small tilt, then another, a sequence of moves like a magician. My heart beat very hard and then, for a moment, not at all.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Jill said. \u201cHey.\u201d She was up and around the table and holding my arm and then my face but her hands were two seconds behind the clock. \u201cYou\u2019re pale. Paler.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. My voice was smaller than it needed to be. A light cracked open behind my eyes and poured into my skull, too fast. The room did a shimmer as if it had caught fire and then remembered it was made of drywall and sighs.\n\n\u201cI need you to breathe,\u201d Jill said, this time the way she says it to people who are very seriously not breathing. \u201cSomeone\u2014can someone\u2014\u201d Her voice went louder, echoing in the polite hotel air. \u201cCall down to the desk. Now. Please.\u201d She pressed her fingers to my wrist. \u201cWhat did you eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cMelon,\u201d I said, but the word felt like three syllables and none of them agreed. \u201cJuice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, lying because she knew I didn\u2019t need the truth. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\nThe light behind my eyes flared, a match lit in a closet, and then I saw something else, as clear as if I\u2019d stepped into the scene. I was under white canvas, not hotel plaster. The air smelled like sugar burnt just to the edge and then coaxed back. People were cheering and then not cheering and it was because they couldn\u2019t hear. The judges were in front of me. The silver-haired one\u2014him of the eyebrow\u2014was smiling at a slant that meant he wasn\u2019t just being TV-kind. The other judge, the one who wore jackets like exclamation points, was clapping and her rings sent light everywhere, everywhere. There was a noise like a bell in a church and then more light from above, like snow that wasn\u2019t cold, falling. Gold paper detritus caught in my eyelashes. A feeling like the world opened and I was right at the mouth of it. Someone said my name or the name I was using then and it didn\u2019t sound wrong, it sounded exactly like me. I could feel the weight of the award in my hands. I could feel how my muscles had gone slack with relief, with love for the thing I could do when the world left me alone with ingredients and time. Confetti. That\u2019s what it was. That\u2019s what had been haunting me in my kitchen, that blur of light. Confetti. A confetti storm.\n\nIt was me. It was me, and the time was not now but before. It was last year. It was last year, and I had already been here. I had already stood in that tent and made a thing so fragile it caught its own breath. I had won.\n\nI gasped and that gasped turned into a cough and then back into a gasp, and then the present returned like a greedy tide, dragging back chairs and the sound of Jill\u2019s voice and someone else shaking the manager by the lapels. I was on the floor because the chair had not been enough. The carpet was awful against my cheek. Jill\u2019s knees were next to my head and her hand was a stripe across my chest. I threw up nothing because there was nothing in me; everything in me had risen into that one bright recall and then collapsed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Jill said, but she also moved me, which is what you do when someone is in danger of breathing their tongue. \u201cLook at me. Eyes.\u201d She snapped her fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re okay. I know you\u2019re not, but you\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\nMy voice came from far away. My voice always goes on trips when I need it. \u201cJill,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2014\u201d I swallowed. The juice had left a film I didn\u2019t want inside me. \u201cI won.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her hair had come loose; she looked like the kind of angel no one mentions because the sight makes you weep.\n\n\u201cI was there,\u201d I said, trying to catch the words as they slid around. \u201cI won. Last year. The final. With the confetti. The\u2026 you know. They said my\u2014 they said me.\u201d The memory hovered and then sharpened. \u201cI won,\u201d I whispered, and the whisper turned into a sound like a laugh, then a cry. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t\u2014 I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d she said, and for once I had surprised her, and it made me want to keep talking just to see her face change more.\n\n\u201cI won,\u201d I said again, because the only way to make a thing true is to say it out loud where someone can catch it. \u201cAnd then\u2014\u201d I touched my forehead and felt, through my skin, the little ridge under my hair, the scar where the skin had knitted imperfectly. I put two fingers there and the hotel ceiling did a slow twirl.\n\nThe manager was there now, and someone in a white shirt too tight over their careful chest. A first aid kit materialized. A cup of water with a straw I couldn\u2019t hold. The orange juice glass on the table, my fingerprints a smudge on the side, the rest of the liquid leering at me like a carnival mirror. My tongue tried to form the words spit and poison and no, but my body was more interested in getting my heart back on tempo, in not allowing the floor to swallow me.\n\n\u201cParamedics,\u201d Jill said. \u201cI\u2019m one.\u201d She showed them something from her pocket, a card that made people step back and remember, for a second, that they loved their mothers. \u201cShe needs to be checked. Now.\u201d\n\nI had arrived at the moment where everyone moved quickly and I yielded. I thought, briefly, about my aprons upstairs, folded like letters to a future I assumed would be waiting. I thought about the note in the desk and then under the pillow, the word that gave an order I had failed to follow.\n\nRemember.\n\nMy head was full of fog and golden paper. The fog embarrassed me. The paper made me giddy. I let them pick me up. I let them shine a light in my eyes and say something about pupils and response. I let Jill squeeze my fingers and check for tremors. And then, because it was important, because it was the only thing I could take from the blur and hold like a little animal, I told her again. \u201cI won last year,\u201d I said. \u201cI forgot. I forgot and then I won.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jill said, and her voice changed. It dropped the pitch it uses for strangers and started speaking to me like I was her sister and also the person she doesn\u2019t trust with scissors. \u201cTell me later. I need you now.\u201d\n\nThere was a shape in the doorway of the breakfast room, a person I couldn\u2019t place with a coat too appropriate for the weather. They glanced, then left, the way guilty people do even when they\u2019ve done nothing. I tried to remember their face, to pull their eyes forward. It didn\u2019t stick. I tried to remember the confetti again instead, and the tent smell, and the weight in my hands. It stuck too well, like sugar in a pot you forget to watch.\n\nOne of the paramedics asked my name and I gave them the one from my ID and then, unhelpfully, my pen name. \u201cShe does that,\u201d Jill told them. \u201cShe\u2019s both. She\u2019s fine, except for not being fine.\u201d She brushed hair from my face. \u201cHoney, who gave you that juice?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d I said, because in my head Jill hands me everything. It was safer to pretend that no one else could touch my mouth.\n\nTap-tap. The manager again. \u201cOur staff wouldn\u2019t\u2014 I mean, we train\u2014 We have cameras. If someone\u2014 we can\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCameras,\u201d Jill said, and the word was as crisp as ice cracking. \u201cThen go look.\u201d\n\nSomeone lifted. Someone steadied. The elevator had never been so slow. The bed upstairs took me and I sank as if it had been waiting for my shape. On the way, in the place between upright and lying down where words sometimes shake loose, I said to Jill, \u201cI needed to make the cage. That\u2019s the hard part. The praline, you have to go to soft crack and then pull it, you have to coax it. Like a stubborn cat. The heat wants to own you. But if you talk to it, it listens.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she said, and kissed my knuckles. \u201cTell the judge that. He loves metaphors.\u201d\n\nThe room smelled faintly like lavender because I had touched the oil without thinking. Light skirted around the edges of the blackout curtains. The city did its small daytime noise. My head did not so much hurt now as float, without regard to gravity or common sense. Somewhere in the building a door shut louder than it needed to. Somewhere in me a door opened and swung, open-open, the kind of open I had feared every time I remembered not remembering.\n\nI lay and counted backwards from one hundred and got to ninety-three before falling asleep hard and graceless, the way a drunken body surrenders. The last thought I had was not a thought; it was the sensation of sugar between my fingers and gold paper in my hair, gratitude falling. And in that space just before dark I understood that there had been a reason I wouldn\u2019t watch last year\u2019s final with Jill. Not hives. Fear. And the knowledge that something in me had already cupped that kind of joy and then spilled it, carelessly, while crossing an empty street in daylight.\n\nWhen I woke, Jill\u2019s mouth was a line and she was on the phone with someone she did not like. Her voice made the air sharpen. \u201cThen explain to me,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy the only waitress within ten feet of the juice table was the same one who served the production team yesterday. Explain to me why there was a man in a navy cap standing behind my sister\u2019s chair for longer than the people behind everyone else\u2019s chairs.\u201d\n\nShe listened. The listening made her jaw clench the way it does when she thinks I can\u2019t see. She covered the phone and looked at me and her eyes were glassy and then not. \u201cDo you remember anything else?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, because I wanted to be useful. \u201cI remember the way the judge\u2019s voice sounded last year when he said my name. Like he was surprised. Like he had planned to say someone else\u2019s and then didn\u2019t. I remember the weight of the\u2014 of the trophy. It\u2019s heavy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remember that,\u201d she said slowly, like we were both trying to step onto a step we weren\u2019t sure existed. \u201cDo you remember not opening a box in June? Do you remember leaving a box in the garage for three months because you said you didn\u2019t know who it belonged to?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, because I didn\u2019t. My head did the small in-and-out motion it does when trying to find a hallway. \u201cDid I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d she said. \u201cYou told me you felt like you were stealing from someone. And then, when I got mad, you cried and then laughed and then went outside and came back with rhubarb and made a galette that made me forgive you.\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and the picture came, a slant of light across the garage floor, a cardboard box with tape that didn\u2019t match my tape. I remembered lifting it and feeling my wrists complain. I remembered there being something inside with metal corners and my relief when I put it down. There had been a dusting of gold in the air, small, everywhere, as if I\u2019d brought it in on the hem of my jeans.\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d I squeezed my eyes tighter. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d she said, snapping in exactly the way that meant she was trying not to cry. \u201cApologize for nothing. We\u2019re going to figure out who spiked your breakfast. We\u2019re going to figure out why you didn\u2019t get told last year\u2019s story the way you deserved to. And we\u2019re going to go to the Pavilion and you\u2019re going to do what you came to do, unless you can\u2019t stand up, in which case I will tie you to the counter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat seems dramatic,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling dramatic,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you sit up slowly and drink water like a human? Don\u2019t tilt your head. Nice and slow. That\u2019s it. Good. Gorgeous. You\u2019re a hydration model.\u201d\n\nThe water was room-temperature and tasted like victory. Or maybe I was confusing my senses. The memory of confetti felt like dehydration and a cure. The remaining badness in my body felt like a foolishness I wanted to shrug off like a wet coat. I put my hand on my ribs and felt how my lungs reached for the air and found it. I thought of the show tent, its white armor, the way it felt to stand in a place designed to be a stage and not a home, and I thought of my small kitchen and its burnt edges and its miraculous soft light. I belonged nowhere exactly. I could make something edible anywhere someone let me have mixing bowls and flour.\n\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll let me compete?\u201d I asked, and heard how I was trying, again, to be brave.\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll let them stop you?\u201d she said. \u201cListen.\u201d She put her phone down and took my hand, variety of the caliber of sincerity she rarely uses because it means we are admitting to the existence of futures without guarantees. \u201cTell me again. The confetti.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was everywhere,\u201d I said. \u201cIt got in my mouth. It tasted like paper. I tried to spit it out and the camera caught me trying to be polite and failing. The judge said, \u2018You gave us a cathedral in pastry,\u2019 and I laughed because that\u2019s quite the line, right? And then I was crying because he was right, and I had. And everywhere gold paper kept falling. I carried some of it home in my pockets, I think.\u201d I touched my hair. \u201cThere might still be some in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cLet them try to wash it out. Let them try to make you ordinary.\u201d\n\nThe hotel hummed. My phone was a dead weight on the nightstand. The note peeked out from under the pillow and did not glow, but it could have. Remember. Either a warning or an instruction. Either way, a direction.\n\nWe sat in that quiet and loud room and watched the time do what time does in hospitals and hotel rooms and backstage dressing rooms: it ran angrily in place, then took off without telling anyone. When the knock came at the door, I knew two things: that I had a second to decide how to stand up, and that someone on the other side wanted to tell me something that would both clarify and murk the water.\n\nIt was the producer, of course. He had hair that looked like it had been airbrushed onto his head and a smile like a trademark. He looked at me the way people look at people who have been tricked and then discovered there was a gift behind the trick.\n\n\u201cWe have a situation,\u201d he said, and then the rest of the morning said it with him.He stood in the doorway like a punctuation mark someone had dropped in the wrong place, and Jill slid between us the way water finds its level. His smile was the kind that starts as a reflex and then has to be manually adjusted into sincerity. He used my pen name twice in the first sentence, as if invoking it could keep the room neat. He said words like we and safety and optics, and I watched his hands while he talked because hands tell you who someone is when their mouth is paid not to.\n\n\u201cWe have medics on site,\u201d he said, and looked at Jill, recalibrating. \u201cYou know protocol. We need her to be seen. After that, she can compete if she signs a waiver acknowledging\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jill said, before he could make the word sound better than it is. \u201cNo waivers. A signature is not a vitamin. She\u2019s seeing your medic, and then we\u2019ll decide.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me again as if I might be easier to move. I made my face polite, which is how I say no without having to make a scene. The room had the wrong number of corners. The note under my pillow warmed my scalp like a little heating pad for courage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also something else,\u201d he said, and ran a hand over his hair as if to confirm it was still theoretical. \u201cOur compliance team flagged a\u2026 possible duplication. We didn\u2019t connect it at auditions because of the name, but someone in Calgary\u2014someone in\u2026 wardrobe\u2014recognized you this morning. We need to know if you\u2019ve\u2014if you might have been with us before. Last season.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, because the truth had woken up inside me and was stretching. The startled sound he made told me he had been hoping for coincidence. \u201cI think I was,\u201d I said, and then, because I wanted to puncture the clean balloon of his neutrality, I added, \u201cI think I won.\u201d\n\nHe blinked like flash photography. Behind him, the hallway took a breath and swallowed. \u201cWe\u2014\u201d He looked at Jill and then back at me. \u201cWe film multiple endings,\u201d he said, and his voice had a new layer, the one they use on contestants who are crying prettily and haven\u2019t signed anything yet. \u201cTo protect the integrity of the results from leaks. Confetti for everyone, essentially. You were in the final. You were\u2026 exceptional. We shot\u2026 coverage. We sent all three finalists home with the standard hamper. We\u2026 became aware of your medical situation the following week and were asked to make no further contact.\u201d\n\nJill didn\u2019t flinch like I expected. She held his gaze until his eyes did a small surrender. Later I would realize that nothing he was saying was news to her. In the now, I felt a small tear move down my scalp where the memory had stitched itself in, and it hurt, and it didn\u2019t. \u201cSo it\u2019s possible,\u201d I said, careful with words like scalpels. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the confetti is in my head because you put it there on purpose. Because you asked me to hold something heavy and told me to look like it was mine.\u201d My laugh surprised me by being gentle. \u201cI\u2019m good at pretending.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good at baking,\u201d he said quickly, like flattery could cauterize. \u201cAlso at taking direction.\u201d He blushed after, a human blush that made him briefly likable. \u201cLook. There are rules. If a competitor has previously reached the final, they are ineligible for future seasons. We should have\u2026 recognized. We didn\u2019t. That\u2019s on us. However,\u201d he said, as if producing a rabbit he wasn\u2019t sure of, \u201cthe decoy endings complicate eligibility. In our books, the finalist is the person whose win was broadcast. You were not the broadcast winner. Technically. We are prepared to allow you to compete. But we need to be careful, because if anyone\u2014if social media\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media is a basement we don\u2019t owe rent to,\u201d Jill said, and crossed her arms. \u201cShe\u2019s competing if she\u2019s safe to compete. If she isn\u2019t, she isn\u2019t. If you try to use her as an arc, I will film my own ending.\u201d\n\nHe ducked, acknowledging a blow he\u2019d earned. The performance left his face and a tired man looked out. \u201cSomeone delivered a drink to your table unasked,\u201d he said softly, as if this might be a secret we could make small by whispering. \u201cWe have the footage. It was an affiliate server in a hotel uniform who took a tray from our hospitality table. A man in a navy cap spoke to her, briefly. He could be nobody. He could be\u2026 an eager fan. He could be on our payroll. We don\u2019t know yet. Our medic would like to draw blood. We would like to file a report. We would also like to put a human next to your station who is not a competitor and not a producer. If you have a sister who is a paramedic who refuses to sign anything, that would be ideal.\u201d\n\nJill\u2019s chin lifted as if someone had just offered to pronounce her last name correctly. \u201cI\u2019ll take that lanyard,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll stand where I can see her hands and everyone else\u2019s. I\u2019ll fetch her water. I\u2019ll glare at anyone who comes within a meter without a good reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, and his relief was so unguarded that I chose to like him for another minute. \u201cAlso\u2014\u201d He hesitated, and then did the brave thing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. For last year. For any way in which we made a hard thing harder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mailed me a box,\u201d I said, thinking of the tape that hadn\u2019t matched any of mine. \u201cI left it in the garage like it belonged to a woman who might come by later and ring the bell and ask for it back.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and stared at his shoes. \u201cThere were\u2026 cookies in there. From the craft team. They write letters to finalists sometimes. Notes. I have\u2026 I have a daughter who writes to people she sees on the show. She thinks the tent is a church.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her it isn\u2019t,\u201d I said, and then softened because the tent is a holy place to me even when I don\u2019t call it that. \u201cTell her sometimes people pray in there anyway.\u201d\n\nWhen the medic came, he was younger than my hunger and very serious. He asked me to touch my nose and press my tongue against my teeth and fix my eyes on his finger. If he had asked me to recite recipes in reverse chronological order I could have. He took blood and apologized to my vein and taped me with a little square of hope. He listened to my heart and said it was trying to be good despite feeling like a drum someone else was playing. He asked what I had eaten and drunk and seemed interested in the melon in a way I hadn\u2019t expected. \u201cPesticides can make people weird,\u201d he said, and then blushed as if he\u2019d confessed to reading gossip. \u201cI mean. Not in a\u2026 criminal way. Just. Sometimes the body says, absolutely not. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, which was true in the way the sky is fine even when it\u2019s considering rain. \u201cI can stand. I can\u2026 do things with eggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep you sitting until the last minute,\u201d Jill said, and tucked my hair behind my ear with the tenderness she keeps in a special pocket. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll eat something the shape of a cracker. Plain. Air and salt. Don\u2019t argue. Save your fire for sugar.\u201d\n\nThe Pavilion was a white animal in the morning light, square and practical with a sighing belly. The cold here was an argument the air had with itself and then resolved. Equipment trucks squatted like cows in a field. A swath of winter-blue tarp did its best to pretend to be sky. Inside, the fake tent was a cathedral of PVC and hope, lights hanging like planets domesticated. The floor had been taped in lines where our paths should not cross and where cameras wanted us to pretend not to see them. The smell was a careful layering: lemon cleaner, vanilla extract, the echo of yesterday\u2019s coffee, nerves, hairspray, wool.\n\nThe contestants were penguin-ing into their places, balancing baskets of ingredients like offerings. Moose Jaw Eclair lifted a hand in greeting and then let it drop, as if friendliness might be stolen by proximity. The Nanaimo Bar Man wore a shirt that made a case for plaid as destiny. The boy with the blessing meringues was more man than boy today, jaw set, the slice in his eyebrow deeper than I remembered, as if ambition had sharpened it. There were new faces I recognized by rumor, not by sight: a woman from the North Shore who slept with her sourdough starter like a hot water bottle, a teacher from Thunder Bay who had promised the mothers in her class she would make custard look easy.\n\nWhen the judges walked in, the air showed them to their marks like an usher. The silver-haired man had removed the part of his face that belongs to memes and was wearing a mouth that might belong to a person who says thank you in grocery stores. The woman with rings had on a jacket the color of cranberry juice pretending to be wine. Her eyes softened when she saw me in a way that told me she was the kind of person who remembers names with the full bodies they belong to.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re honored,\u201d she said to all of us, and meant it. Cameras leaned toward us. The host, a man with a voice like toast, said the word Canada as if it were a person he loved.\n\n\u201cSignature,\u201d the producer had told us in the email with the underlined call time. \u201cA pair of tarts that tell us where you\u2019re from and where you\u2019re going. Two flavors, one crust. Five hours.\u201d\n\nFive hours is a sentence and a forgiveness. You can ruin and rebuild in five hours if your hands stay true. You can call your grandmother\u2019s winter over and tell spring it can come in. You can make a custard that sets like resolve if you remember not to bully the eggs. I held my apron up like it could cover fear the way it covers clothes. Jill tied me in with a professional knot that would hold a body on a stretcher and then smoothed the string twice because she can\u2019t help mothering the things she saves.\n\n\u201cWater,\u201d she said, and handed me a bottle she had opened herself. \u201cDon\u2019t leave it. If you want more, say my name. Not any other name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have only one name,\u201d I said, and she raised one eyebrow until I added, \u201cIn this room.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo your thing,\u201d she said, and stepped back to the line someone else had taped on the floor to keep her off the television and out of the story.\n\nWhen the clock started, the sound was bright and unnecessary. Metal, glass, a chorus of knives. I moved in the way my body knows when my head gets out of the way. Flour. Butter. Salt. Water so cold it argued back when I touched it. I grated butter into the bowl until my hand ached with useful pain and the pieces looked like the first snow that doesn\u2019t stick. I pinched and cut and folded until the dough came together with the possibility of flake. I told it to rest and wrapped it and sent it to cool. The mixer\u2019s hum became the sound of home.\n\nTo tell them where I\u2019m from, I steeped tea. Earl Grey, blood orange twist. Not too long. Not enough to scald the leaf into bark. I warmed cream and coaxed the heat into tempering eggs with a patience I did not have in any other part of my life. The custard thickened like a promise I wasn\u2019t ready to make, and I set it aside, skin pressed with parchment because nobody likes memory on their tongue when it isn\u2019t theirs.\n\nTo tell them where I\u2019m going, I made a curd the color of a small sun. Lemon, sure, but with sea buckthorn I\u2019d frozen last fall in a fit of prairie abundance. Tart that doesn\u2019t apologize. Sweet that knows its limits. Butter beaten in at the end like you\u2019re convincing someone to stay. Behind me someone dropped a pan and swore in French and the sound made me love the room harder.\n\nI rolled the dough too thin on purpose and then stacked it, laminating my own stubbornness. The crusts blind-baked under ceramic weights that looked like marbles smuggled out of a schoolyard. While they browned, I candied chokecherries for later, not because the brief asked for it but because I wanted the taste of last summer to glisten somewhere I could reach.\n\nJill\u2019s hand hovered into my frame with more water and I took it, drank, set it down, watched her take it away like a magician so no one else could touch it. The silver-haired judge stopped at my station long enough to say, \u201cYou look\u2026 familiar,\u201d and then tilted his head in a way that told me that wasn\u2019t his question.\n\n\u201cSo do you,\u201d I said, and placed my palms flat on the counter because sometimes bodies talk without permission. \u201cI steeped your favorite too long last time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBold,\u201d he said, a line we both remembered from a place my brain can only find if it runs. His smile had corners that weren\u2019t allowed on television.\n\nThe ringed judge came two stations later and pretended not to know my name until her hand brushed an imaginary lapel and I saw the corner of an envelope flash behind her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the sea buckthorn,\u201d she said. \u201cPrairie acid. It\u2019s a neglected fruit. Like an eccentric aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe buys the best gifts,\u201d I said. \u201cWrapped in brown paper and twine. You have to work to get to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and moved along, her rings scattering light like someone happy to pay the electric bill.\n\nOther people\u2019s kitchens make different sounds. Moose Jaw Eclair whistled through her teeth when she was brave. The Thunder Bay teacher hummed under her breath the way you do at two in the morning with a baby, a rhythm that convinces the air to help. Nanaimo Bar Man scraped something with determination and muttered about coconut like prayer.\n\nHalfway through, my head went briefly to a place that smelled like lavender and hospital sheets and then swung back like a door with a chain. The world took a step to one side and I let it. I set one hand flat on the counter and the other on my ribcage and counted to four and to six and to eight. I tasted citrus that wasn\u2019t there because memory has its own pantry. When the tilt righted, I looked at Jill and she tapped two fingers to her wrist, our shorthand for time, for pulse, for I\u2019m here.\n\nWe layered tart shells with jam, thin as forgiveness. Custard poured like silk. Curd sat up like a girl at her first grown-up table and decided to behave. I made a lattice for the top of one of them out of pecan praline because my hands needed a difficult thing to do. Sugar to hard crack, not too far. Amber like the underside of a fox. Pulling it is a negotiation, not a war. I stretched, doubled back, wove, cooled, pressed. The threads remembered being liquid. My fingers remembered being burned before and chose differently.\n\n\u201cTen minutes,\u201d the host said, and the cameras leaned so hard I could hear their gears. I sugared cranberries for a frost and set them on the curd like punctuation. I scattered the chokecherries across the custard tart and dripped the reduction in five unwise places that made it look like a map that only I could read. I wiped my plates the way a person wipes a mouth, indulgent and exact.\n\nSomeone behind me said, \u201cOh, come on,\u201d not to anyone in particular but to the God of Sugar and Heat, and my heart reached for them in sympathy and then remembered it belonged to me. The high camera sang its mechanical song. The clock did the theater thing where twelve seconds takes a lifetime and one minute is barely room to breathe. I put my hands on the edge of the bench and waited for time to turn into applause or lesson.\n\nWhen they called for us to step back, I stepped back. Jill blew out a breath like someone had been holding her under. The room did its near-silence, the kind that shakes after being loud.\n\nJudging is a ritual and a tangle. You offer your sacrament to strangers and ask them to call it by its name. The judges moved, and the moving made each of us hold still. They tasted Moose Jaw\u2019s eclairs and said river and current and your pastry is a little tough, my love. They tasted the Thunder Bay custard and said classroom and comfort and could be deeper, but what a dream. When they got to me, the silver-haired judge held my plate as if it might bite.\n\n\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d he asked, and I told him, as if I hadn\u2019t already, in apples and Earl Grey and soft flakes. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked next, and I put the sea buckthorn under his tongue. He closed his eyes. He opened them and was asked by cameras to say a sentence that could be put on gift mugs.\n\n\u201cYou have restraint I don\u2019t expect from a person who clearly likes drama,\u201d he said, and I smiled because I am the kind of girl who used to cry over soggy bottoms in other people\u2019s pies. The ringed judge touched the praline lattice with one fingernail and looked like a person who believes in the engineering feats of women in kitchens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a window,\u201d she said. \u201cA window that opens.\u201d She went quiet in the way people do when they have decided to be generous and not perform it. \u201cI could eat this forever,\u201d she added, which is not a thing anyone can do, but it was sweet.\n\nI took my breath down from where it had been watching the lights. Jill\u2019s hand flew up a joy it didn\u2019t know where to put and then settled, embarrassed, on her hip. The Nanaimo Bar Man grinned at me from his corner like we had made a pact not to die on television and were going to keep it. The boy with the meringue blesses scowled down at his own plate with love like an angry father and I felt an old affection for people who are tender and pretend not to be.\n\nBetween the signature and the technical there is always a lull designed to let the story catch up. We were herded to a table with fruit that looked brighter than reality and water that had to be opened in front of us like a magic trick with seals and seals. The host came and told a joke about winter we laughed at because he needed us to. My hands shook the tiny shake of spent adrenaline and new. Jill leaned on the fake fence behind me and watched the room like a training exercise.\n\nThe producer stopped two yards away as if proximity could hurt us both. He lifted his chin a fraction at Jill, and she lowered her lanyard in reply as if to say, I earned this. He stepped closer and his breath carried coffee and apology. \u201cThe lab called,\u201d he said, quiet enough that only my fear could hear. \u201cIf there was anything in the juice responsible, it\u2019s gone or too small. Sugar, citrus, a little pith. No unusual agents. Keep hydrating. The hotel is reviewing. The police would like to ask you questions after today,\u201d he added, like a footnote. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cAlso. Wardrobe. The note you found. That wasn\u2019t from us.\u201d\n\nMy blood did a small turn in the cul-de-sac behind my heart. \u201cWho?\u201d I asked, and he shook his head in a way that meant speculation but not certainty. \u201cWe found a man in a navy cap on the tape,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t see his face. He speaks to the waitress, points, then leaves when you fall. He doesn\u2019t look back.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jill muttered. \u201cPeople madly in love with their own invisibility never do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d he said, and for a moment I was sorry for him again in the way I get sorry for bees trapped against glass. He slid away before he got stuck to us.\n\nThe technical was posted on the big board with numbers instead of names because humiliation is best administered anonymously. Pithiviers. Maple-pumpkin, twenty-six layers, leaf pattern on top, but with a trick: no measurements. We were given flour and butter and the memory of how our grandmothers did it when they had time and a day that wasn\u2019t trying to kill them. I rolled my shoulders and listened to my wrists. The tent breathed. Outside, the winter reconsidered its position.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t rush the turns,\u201d Jill mouthed, and I nodded, pocketing the advice with the lavender oil and my grandmother\u2019s whispered remember to salt the fruit. The oven in front of me clicked once, like a cat offended, and I tapped its side and told it we were not playing games today.\n\nIf the signature is a confession you choose, the technical is a test you don\u2019t get to study for. Butter is a language that doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re good with words. It cares if you are patient when everyone around you is not. It cares if you can let a thing be cold enough to say yes. I listened when the dough told me to stop. I turned and chilled and turned again until my elbows wanted their own lives. I drew the leaf lines with the back of a knife, not too hard, the way you trace your name on fogged glass to remind yourself you can make a mark without breaking anything.\n\nAs we slid our pastry into ovens, I caught the boy with the meringue blessing looking at my station with a quick, guilty eye. It wasn\u2019t a thief look. It was a pilgrim look. He lifted his head and met me and flushed and then smiled in a way that was like a telegram: I like your work. Don\u2019t tell.\n\nJill caught my look and let her fingers drum three times on her thigh, our old code for later. When my pithivier rose, it did the thing a heart does when someone speaks kindly to it. It flaked at the edges like a good secret. It browned the way labor pays attention.\n\nThe ranking was kind to me without being obscene. I was called second because the top had a place where I had pressed too hard and the judge found the mean joy of a technicality. I let the tease be what it was. The Nanaimo Bar Man grinned as if he\u2019d been made valedictorian and given a pie to hold. The woman from the North Shore cut her piece too soon and apologized in a way that made me want to wrap her in a towel and send her home with soup.\n\nWe had a breath before the showstopper, and in that breath the light shifted the color of the walls. The tent felt more like a room and less like a machine. My knees remembered the hotel carpet. The gold paper memory slid its hand into mine and didn\u2019t squeeze so much as steady. I looked for the man in the navy cap because the brain is a dog that wants a scent. The crowd behind the tape looked like a science fair had married a farmer\u2019s market. Faces, coats, expectant eyes. Someone held up a sign with nothing on it because they had forgotten the marker. A child licked a candy cane as if it could give answers. In the far corner a figure in a coat too appropriate lingered and then left, like guilt. I promised myself I would stop making strangers into threats until they proved themselves worthy of the promotion.\n\n\u201cMake me a cage,\u201d I told my hands. \u201cMake me a cage so good that getting out of it feels like learning to breathe again.\u201d The showstopper brief said to construct an architectural showpiece with at least three textures and a narrative throughline. I looked at the clock and at the face of the judge who would raise an eyebrow when my sugar ran on me if I let it.\n\n\u201cBe kind to the eggs,\u201d I wrote on the corner of my mind where the notebook usually lives. \u201cRemember to breathe.\u201d Then I cracked and whisked and caramelized like a person who had finally, after years of being almost, stopped rehearsing her courage and brought it to the table, even if the table shook.Sugar is not patient simply because you ask it nicely, but there is a point where it remembers what it wanted to be before it was granulated and sealed in paper. I brought the temperature up slow, listening for that small change in sound that happens just before soft crack, the whisper that is almost a whistle. The copper pot felt alive under my hand, as if it had a small animal curled inside it that might run if I turned my head. I kept the brush moving around the interior in gentle sweeps, water taming the crystals that wanted to climb the sides and colonize the rim. When the syrup lifted from the spoon in thin, bright threads that tried to pull back to themselves like spiders returning home, I took it off the heat and breathed the way you do before stepping into a freezing river. There is a window when sugar forgives you for every time you have rushed it. There is also a window when it remembers an insult. I decided to be forgiven.\n\nThe dacquoise layers had baked to the color of a well-loved book page and were cooling obediently on the rack I had commandeered like a pirate with a sense of fairness. The rhubarb mousse had set enough to hold its shape and not so much that it would sulk when asked to spread. The chokecherry reduction simmered low, a dark garnet ribbon that made a sound I knew as well as my name. Jill brought me ice in a metal bowl without being asked and set it within reach of my left hand the way she sets a bag of saline by a bed, visible but not demanding. She did not hover; she orbited. When I needed another bowl, it was in my hand. When I needed to not see anyone who wasn\u2019t my sister, she acquired height and radiated intent and people discovered they had somewhere else to be.\n\nI poured the sugar in a thin stream over a greased, inverted copper bowl and let my wrist move in the little motions it has learned from handwriting and whisking. You cannot force lattice. You have to suggest the path and let heat remember how to draw. Thread on thread, a dome began to appear, less a cage than a promise of one, the negative space more important than the sugar itself. The tent lights caught on the strands and made them look wetter than they were. Somewhere to my left someone said, \u201cDamn,\u201d with reverence, and I knew without looking that their caramel had gone too far and tipped bitter. The discipline required to not look was a new kind of muscle I was growing right there on television.\n\nTwice the sugar refused a line and balled itself; twice I resisted the old instinct to fix the past by touching it again. I started another thread a centimeter away and pretended I had planned that gap. Gaps are kindness in architecture; they let light through, and air, and whatever is watching you breathe. My fingers trembled once, and I let them, because hands that are held too still tear fine things. I spoke to the sugar under my breath and told it a story about winter on a farm, about a grandmother who could make butter listen simply by laying her palm on the churn. I thought about making cathedrals out of nothing and how the first time I\u2019d heard that word used on something I made I had laughed because it sounded like flattery that wanted to be a blessing.\n\nThe reduction needed a stir and the mousse needed faith. I layered dacquoise and mousse in the ring mold, spread the chokecherry like a band of mischief through the middle, a line of tart truth. I pressed in another layer with the heel of my hand and heard the quiet compression that tells you the structure will hold its own story. There is a small thrill in un-molding something that has been holding its breath; you say now as if you are cutting a ribbon, and if the cake agrees it will let its sides slip and settle and you will look like a person who is brave. The rhubarb held; the frosting I had not called frosting smoothed under the spatula as if it had been waiting for this moment and not pretending to be shy. I set the dome down over the top and it came to rest with the lightest of taps, a bell that had just remembered it is a bell.\n\nTwice during that hour a shadow leaned too close to my table and twice Jill moved between sunlight and interference with the unremarkable authority of a streetlight changing. The second time she touched the sleeve of a man in a navy cap with a smile I recognized as the one she gives to patients who are seconds from bolting. He pretended to be interested in the Thunder Bay teacher\u2019s custards. She bent toward him and said something too low for me to hear, and he stiffened in a way that told me a name had been spoken that belonged to him, or to someone he feared. He retreated. She watched him go and then did not return to me immediately, which meant she was not finished mothering the perimeter.\n\nWhen the clock called three minutes and the host made the universal gesture for we are nearly done pretending this is about time, I placed the sugared cranberries at the base of the dome, a ring of winter frost that made the whole thing look less like a trap and more like a lantern. The chokecherry dripped in exactly the two places that cameras like and exactly the two places where a judge might say, what is that for, and then answer themselves. I cleaned the plate again because there is no such thing as too much kindness where plates are concerned. I did not touch my water without watching Jill pick it up and put it in my mouth the way you do with a child who is learning to be careful.\n\nWhen we stepped back, the room seemed to lean forward, hundreds of eyes finding ways to become a single gaze. I knew how my piece looked because I had been inside it while I made it, but seeing it from this distance made my chest do a small inward sigh. Under the sugar dome, the pink of the mousse glowed like a summer fruit in a January window, the dacquoise layers visible like strata in a cliff telling history in the way rocks do, the ring of cranberries offering a storybook lie about frost that doesn\u2019t bite. It wasn\u2019t the same as last year. It couldn\u2019t be. But it had the necessary arrogance: the part that says I am fragile and I am not begging you not to touch me.\n\nJudging started at the far end. The Moose Jaw eclairs had grown into a low bridge of p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux and spun sugar and the judges made the kind of sounds people make for engineers who have a sense of humor. The North Shore sourdough woman had made a lighthouse of laminated dough that leaned a degree and a half in the way that makes people love buildings. The Nanaimo Bar Man had built the bar itself into a folly with shining chocolate walls and a roof of praline tile, and I almost forgave him for how he said coconut because the roof was beautiful. The boy with the blessing meringue had made a chapel of pavlova, and I wanted to take his face in my hands and tell him he had permission to be as careful with his own heart as he is with sugar.\n\nWhen they came to me, the silver-haired judge stared at the dome with that unreadable kindness he wears when he is deciding how much truth to tell. He put two fingers to the sugar and lifted. The dome came off with a release that was almost a sigh, a piece of air that had finally been given back. He set it down on the plate with a delicacy you would not associate with a man who had publicly mocked underbaked bottoms. The ringed judge bent close as if to smell the inside of the idea. Her rings flashed; she smiled as if they had flashed on purpose.\n\n\u201cYou made a room,\u201d she said, and I said, because repetition can be a spell, \u201cI made a room,\u201d and then we both laughed and pretended not to. The silver-haired judge slid his knife in and the dacquoise resisted only out of respect for form and then gave way. He lifted a slice that held its line and did not slouch, and I loved it the way you love a child who tells the truth in a crowded room.\n\nHe put the bite in his mouth and closed his eyes, not for the camera, or not entirely. People who know the difference between performance and need can see it when need wins. The ringed judge tasted the chokecherry and her mouth did a small bright pucker she then chased with mousse. She tapped the side of her knife against the plate, the code she uses for herself when her brain is writing while her mouth is a second behind.\n\n\u201cYou built strength into something that looks like it could blow away,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve layered tartness and nostalgia without giving us a lecture. The sugar\u2014\u201d She lifted the dome and touched it with the pad of one finger, quick, like you test the heat of a pan. \u201cThis has the nerve to be decorative and edible. It isn\u2019t just a hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour narrative is clearer than most novels,\u201d the silver-haired judge said, in the tone of an insult to his own reading habits. \u201cMy only quarrel\u2014\u201d He stopped himself with a small inhale that would have made a less practiced mouth its own joke. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t have a quarrel. I suppose\u2026\u201d He turned the plate half an inch. \u201cIf I were very bored and very mean, I would say we\u2019ve seen you do something like this before. Not this, but a cousin. But you know what I\u2019m going to do instead?\u201d He looked up at me and his eyebrow did not rise, because this was not television for a second. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to keep making the things your hands know how to make. That\u2019s the entire point of this ridiculous enterprise.\u201d\n\nIf anyone had touched my shoulder right then I would have tipped over. I kept my hands at my sides because I have learned that grabbing for joy can make it skitter. Jill exhaled somewhere on the edge of the world and the air shifted the smallest fraction. The camera moved away to register someone else\u2019s ecstasy or small breakage, and I loved it for leaving me alone.\n\nAfter judging, there is the purgatory that you are not allowed to call purgatory. Cameras have to capture the sense that the universe could go any way at once, that your fate might be decided by a degree of oven door left ajar or by a judge waking with a different palate. We stood at our benches while crew rolled and whispered and the host made three jokes about Canadians saying sorry that were not exactly jokes, and the audience held its breath because someone had told them breath looks good on TV when it escapes all at once. Jill rested her forearms on the fake fence and looked like a woman who could start a small fire by staring at wood and show mercy while it burned.\n\nThe producer stood just out of reach and made a circle in the air with his forefinger, the sign for we have to do this and then we can all eat. The judges took their places with the tent behind them like a polite volcano. The host said words I have now heard in dreams, and in a voice with a cadence my bones seem to understand. He thanked the crew, the sponsors, the ghost of Canada. He pointed at the table of our showpieces as if we might forget where we had left the parts of ourselves we could not take with us.\n\nWhen they called the name of the person whose tart had failed structurally and whose courage had not failed even then, we clapped with more love than any other clap. When they called the person whose pithivier had leaked and whose showpiece had leaned, we clapped with the kind of clap you give people who did not make anything break except their own hearts a little. The order of names felt like someone counting rearranged coins in their pocket. I forgot to look at Jill. I forgot to breathe. I did the only thing I have learned to do when the future is approaching with confetti or with weather: I pressed my tongue to the roof of my mouth and tasted sugar and salt and lemon, and I kept my face open.\n\nThey said my pen name and then they said my legal name, because the legal team had decided not to fight the poetry of my life today. They said both with equal weight, which is not how anyone has ever said anything to me. The ringed judge\u2019s mouth made the little O of surprise she uses when she is pretending to be surprised and also when she is. The silver-haired judge looked away for one second as if to save me from his attention. The host said something about journeys that did not make me want to punch a wall. The noise came, the sort of polite thunder Canadians produce, respectful and full of feeling, and then it grew because the pipes let it and because cameras had learned to beg for that.\n\nThe gold paper arrived as if it had just been hiding in the rafters again, waiting for permission to become a blizzard. It fell heavier than I remembered, and lighter, because memory has absolute nerve. It caught in my lashes and in my braid and under the edge of my apron and in the crook of my elbow. It found Jill\u2019s hair and pretended to be frost. It touched the sugar dome and made a sound like laughter.\n\nI was ready for it this time, if ready means I didn\u2019t feel like my chest had been cracked open and a light had been poured in too fast. I let it touch me. I let it collect on my skin. I did not try to spit it out when a piece landed at the corner of my mouth, because this was not the first time, and I am a quick study. Jill pushed her hand into the circle of cameras and wiped a piece from my cheek with the back of two fingers, and somebody somewhere will freeze that frame and call it sisterhood. The ringed judge stepped into my orbit and put her hand on my shoulder in a way that would make the gossip pages call her warm and my grandmother call her honest.\n\nWe filmed the other endings. Of course we did. That is part of the deal you make when you agree to turn your private skill into public property. The confetti machine misbehaved exactly twice and was coaxed back into doing what it said on the invoice. The host said different lines that were the same. I stared straight into the camera when told and then stared straight into space when asked. The boy with the meringue blessing cried beautifully for someone else\u2019s arc, which is a skill we don\u2019t teach and probably should. When it was over and the last piece of gold lay down and gave up being air, they let us go, which is not the same thing as being free.\n\nBackstage, the tent is less holy. Backstage, you see the glue. It comforted me. I sat on a folding chair with a cushion somebody had rescued from the craft truck and let my knees do the small knock they had been saving. Jill brought me a bottle with an unfamiliar label and unscrewed it and smelled it like a suspicious animal. She lifted one eyebrow and put it in my hand. I drank because she let me. The water tasted like tin and flowers, which is to say it tasted like now.\n\n\u201cYou did the thing,\u201d she said, and bent to untie my apron with abrupt gentleness that made my eyes heat. \u201cNo one bled. Your sugar behaved. You didn\u2019t let anyone feed you. We still have to talk to two officers with haircuts, but they can wait while I make you eat something that makes chewing mandatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw him,\u201d I said, because I wanted to put words on the space where fear wanted to live. \u201cThe cap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gave me a name that is probably not his and a reason that is definitely not a reason. He wanted to take a photo \u2018for his niece.\u2019 He had the niece age wrong for the show\u2019s demo. He had the look of a person who wants to be where the story is being made because he can\u2019t make any of his own. He will try again somewhere else. He won\u2019t try here. People like that are allergic to women who glare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho wrote the note, then?\u201d I asked, pressing my palm to my thigh where the word had warmed my skin all morning. \u201cIf not production. If not a fan. If not\u2026 a judge.\u201d\n\nJill took something from her pocket and unfolded it and used the corner of her nail to press a crease that had been resisting since last night. \u201cThis is a photo of the footage they pulled,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom the hotel. The waitress. I talked to her in the hallway. She\u2019s nineteen and going to Mount Royal and thinks the show makes January bearable. She cried. She was told to deliver a tray to a table by a man who had a lanyard with a pass that looked enough like ours to pass. He pointed at you. He looked like he belonged.\u201d She held the phone for me to look, her hand steady in a way that made me trust the image more than I would have trusted my own eyes. \u201cHe bought the juice from the bar. He kept his thumb over the top of the cup while he walked.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d I said, \u201cthey found nothing in the blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d she said. \u201cThat does not erase motive. That does not erase intention. Sometimes fear eats itself before we can test it. Sometimes love does too.\u201d\n\nThe dressing room mirror had good light, which seemed like a waste. I sat near it and watched my face learn to be a person who had been chosen and not instantly punished for it. Crew people moved through the narrow spaces with competence and low voices and hands that did not touch when touching would carry something in one direction that could not be retrieved. The boy with the meringues stuck his head in the door and put his hand on the frame as if asking permission to be himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not being weird,\u201d he said, which is always the second sentence of someone being weird. \u201cI just\u2026 I\u2019m going to the parking lot. The cameras are at the other door. If you want to leave like a human and not a harvest, I know the way.\u201d\n\nJill looked at me in the mirror in the way she has when her face is the only safe place I can check how I\u2019m doing. I nodded. We left through the hallway where the cables are fat as snakes and the floor has a sticker every three feet instructing you not to trip. In the shadow between two truck backs, the air smelled like exhaust and sugar and a spicy meat that made me think of stampede and summer and being dumb on purpose. The boy walked in front as if clearing the way and then veered off with an embarrassed wave, as if he had done something kind and could not bear to watch us use it.\n\nOutside, Calgary was a city again instead of a backdrop. The sky had decided to be gentle. My knees remembered how to be unremarkable. Jill\u2019s car had a thin skin of grit that meant she had driven enough this winter to have stories I hadn\u2019t heard. When I opened the passenger door, something rustled under my foot. Not a note. An envelope, yes, but the wrong kind; not hotel paper with its stupid crest, not production with its practical branding. Brown, the color of bakery bags, with my pen name and my legal name written in a hand that tried to be careful and missed some letters on purpose, like they\u2019d been trying to forget how to do cursive and failed.\n\nThe interior smelled like the kind of lavender old women grow and rescue when the first frost comes. Inside was a clipping from a local paper with my photo from the first week of the show, your standard \u201clocal baker makes good\u201d piece, and a photo torn carefully from the previous year\u2019s entertainment section, the one with three faces blurred by confetti that meant to be three winners and was not. There was a third piece of paper, not a note. Two words. One written by a hand that has lived out in the cold. The other underlined. Remember. Please.\n\nJill held the envelope between two fingers like an uncertain rescue. \u201cWhere was this?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d I said, because my tongue refused to invent. \u201cThe floor. Or the universe. It\u2019s hard to tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cRead the back,\u201d she said, and I turned the clipping over as if it were a creature that might arc and bite. On the back, the cut that had taken my face out of the page had nicked two lines of text from an advertisement. Do you have something you want to get back? Affordable. Discreet. The phone number had been cut to leave only a city code and two digits. It could be a joke. It could not.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s from a kind person or the other kind?\u201d I asked, and kneaded the edge of the envelope until it softened and probably compromised the integrity of its fibers in a way that would infuriate an archivist.\n\n\u201cI think we don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, which is a thing I am still learning is not a failure but an honest position. \u201cI think we keep it. I think we show it to the haircut men after you sleep. I think we find out who got paid for something they didn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nOn the way back to the hotel, I fell asleep with my forehead against the cool glass and dreamed, not of gold, but of paper. Not confetti, but book pages, the kind with foxing around the edges that makes the air smell like cinnamon. In the dream, I turned the pages and on each was a recipe, not written in my hand but in a hand I wanted to trust. Some were familiar. Some were new. The instructions were precise and then, right where I needed them to tell me what to do, they said, Listen. The dream did the small flicker it does when a real memory tries to substitute and then bowed out. When I opened my eyes again, we were on a street that looked like every street if you live in Alberta and love it: snow that has lost its nerve, a pickup with a sticker of a fish and another of a mountain that looks foreign unless you\u2019ve slept there, a man with a dog that looked like he would tell you about the dog if you asked and also if you didn\u2019t.\n\nUpstairs, the paramedics with haircuts were not unkind. They asked me questions about juice and about whether I had enemies. I thought about what an enemy would look like if I had the imagination for them. A face that looks like a friend except for something in the eyes that looks like winter in March. A pair of hands that have never made anything you can eat. A lanyard. Jill answered when my breath did the stupid hitch that makes simple yeses sound like a confession. They took the envelope and promised to bring it back or at least to call for absolution before they lost it.\n\nThe shower in the hotel was designed to make the body remember it has edges. I stood under it until the water ran from hot into that tepid that means the building has decided I have used enough. I scrubbed sugar from the crooks of my elbows and the inside of my wrists and the small tender skin at the base of my thumb where any decent palm-reader could tell you you\u2019re in trouble. When I stepped out, steam had turned the mirror into a lake. I wrote my pen name on it the way a child writes their crush before they remember their mother also uses that mirror, and then I wiped it away with the heel of my hand and wrote my legal name as if it were a curse I was turning back into a charm.\n\nJill had ordered food that spoke the language of sleeping well: bread, soup, a piece of chicken that looked like it would apologize if it were dry. She had taken off her lanyard and hung it over the lamp in a way that made it look like a trophy. The TV was on but muted, a soft gray square of people moving their mouths, and for the first time in a very long time I did not have the urge to put words into their mouths just to make sense of the shapes.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said, when the plates were mostly empty because hunger had been shy and then remembered to show up. \u201cWe go home. You sleep three days. Then you let me in your garage. We find the box you were afraid to open. We open it in daylight. We make it ordinary. If it isn\u2019t ordinary, we will make it into a story that doesn\u2019t hurt when you tell it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good at that,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m a liar with decent intentions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a communicator,\u201d she said, and reached across the small table to steal a piece of bread because she cannot leave anything unfinished. \u201cDo you want me to sleep in the bed with you like we did when the wind sounded like it had teeth?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to stay in the room,\u201d I said. \u201cI want you to stay in my life. I want you to keep pretending my water is medicine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I can do,\u201d she said, and turned off the lamp before I could see her eyes go soft. \u201cSleep,\u201d she added, and the word landed with the authority of a command that knows it will be obeyed.\n\nSleep came like a polite guest. I dreamed of the neurologist\u2019s hands again, not touching my head this time but setting down a slice of cake on a plate with a blue rim, and saying, Tell me how you made this, and me saying, First I made a room and then I waited until it wanted me in it. In the morning I woke before my alarm and the city was the kind of gray that feels like a promise and not an apology. My head did not hurt, which seemed rude given the attention I had lavished on it the day before. The note under the pillow had acquired a crease that wasn\u2019t there before, as if the word had gotten up in the night and stretched.\n\nOn the way out, the woman at the front desk gave me a look that belongs to accomplices and handed me a small package wrapped in paper that had seen better days. Inside was a bag of cookies that had been baked in a kitchen where someone else had been in charge of sugar. The tag said: For after, and the handwriting looked like a teenager\u2019s trying to grow up. I put them in my bag with the lavender oil and the green notebook and the envelope I had not given away because every story needs one mystery that is yours alone until it isn\u2019t.\n\nWaskasoo Park looked like it had been waiting to greet me with a silence that wasn\u2019t insulted by company. The geese eyed me and decided I had learned nothing and everything. The house tilted its small tilt and let us in like an old friend who knows you will wipe your feet without being told. In the kitchen, the jar of starter had bubbled up and then fallen and smelled like a person making a decision and then changing their mind. The wooden spoon with the bite marks lay where I had left it, domestic and brave. The light in the late afternoon came through the window over the sink and made the air look full of something you could almost touch.\n\nWe moved laundry baskets to get to the door to the garage. Jill found the key in exactly the place I would have put it if I were a person who puts keys where they belong. The garage has the particular sadness of rooms that hold tools and have also held grief. There was the dent in the drywall from the time I had tried to keep a shelf from falling and used my skull. There was the stripe of oil like a bruise that we joke about and don\u2019t. In the corner, under the pegboard with the odd orphaned wrench and the tape measure that likes to lie, sat the box with the tape that didn\u2019t match mine.\n\nI thought I would hesitate. I didn\u2019t. I lifted it and felt the weight settle into the small muscles in my back that use the word careful like a lullaby. I set it on the workbench that still smells like the summer I tried to teach myself to sand. I cut the tape with the knife that was a gift from someone who thought I should carry a knife. The flaps opened like a breath.\n\nConfetti does not behave once contained. It had found ways to climb into cracks and into the folds of the folded things. It dusted the air as if a memory had been keeping itself ready with small breath exercises. On top lay tissue with a weight you would call cheap if you had never needed it to touch your fingers and remind them that paper is a kind of skin. I moved it aside and there it was, both more and less than I had imagined. The hamper, yes, with its metal corners. A letter on thick paper that said all the things production letters say when they want to be both tidy and kind. A certificate with my name in both its versions and a signature printed from a file. A bottle of maple syrup in a shape people who do not live here find irresistible. A set of measuring spoons that looked like they had been made to live in a drawer where they could tell each other their days. A small gold object that was undeniably a trophy and undeniably not the trophy. A plastic stand-in, heavy with irony and also surprisingly heavy in fact.\n\nI picked it up. The heft felt like the moment I had held it last year in a tent that did not belong to me and also completely did. It had a base with a sticker that had lifted at one corner and been pressed back down by a hand that had cared just enough. It had a problem with its center of gravity that made it tilt if you set it down too quickly. It had dignity if you asked a question in the right tone.\n\nJill lifted the letter and read it because she reads aloud when she knows I am not going to. The words were what they were. Thank you. An honor. Your story. Your dedication. The privacy. The medical team. Your sister. We wish you. The future. The exact phrasing a lawyer can live with and a person can live through. At the bottom, a line that was either carelessness or grace. We hope when you are ready, you will remember how this felt.\n\n\u201cI remembered,\u201d I said, and the air in the garage went warmer by a degree. \u201cBefore I saw any of this, I remembered. Even if it was pretend. Even if it was a rehearsal disguised as a day. The feeling was real.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe feeling is still real,\u201d Jill said, and put her hand over mine on the fake trophy, both of us holding an object that had not been designed to carry this much meaning and was doing it anyway. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe the truth to the order things happened in. You owe it to what it did to you.\u201d\n\nWe stood and let the confetti settle the way dust does when you finally stop walking around in it. The garage was ugly and familiar and held a box that had been waiting for me to come back to myself. Somewhere upstairs a radiator sighed like an old man deciding to be generous. I pulled the green notebook from my pocket and opened to a clean page and wrote, not a recipe, but the first sentence of a chapter I had not let myself write because I thought it would hurt.\n\nStart with water. Then add heat, because everything that matters requires it. Then, when you think you have ruined it by waiting too long, pull back, and see.Six is the kind of number a kitchen knows. Six eggs in a carton, six turns in rough puff before you let it rest, six minutes where a custard will ruin if you don\u2019t look at it and decide to love it anyway. In my green notebook I wrote a six with a long tail that looped back on itself and looked like a ribbon that had made peace with becoming something else. Then I put the notebook away because the page would keep until I had hands that weren\u2019t vibrating with the after-image of gold and noise.\n\nWe baked because the house asked us to. The room had been holding its breath while we were gone and you can\u2019t do that to a kitchen and expect it to forgive you. Jill says flour is my religion and when I blushed the first time she said it she looked at me like she had finally figured out a trick drawer. I warmed milk until the surface looked like the top of a lake right before dawn, quivered but not yet convinced to move. In the bottom of the big bowl that used to be our mother\u2019s I sprinkled yeast and sugar and watched it wake like an idea. Cinnamon has its own weather; it bloomed against the air and made January look less sure of itself. I zested orange over my shoulder like the old tales tell you to salt a witch, and the peel fell in bright curls that refused to look ordinary even when I told them this was not television, this was home.\n\nJill leaned against the counter and peeled the paper from a stick of butter with the same efficiency she uses to peel stickers off ambulance equipment. She had taken off the lanyard and folded it small in her pocket, but it still radiated a shape, as if a title can leave an imprint even after it has stopped swinging against your chest. The radio we keep over the fridge for recipes and road conditions and the hockey score murmured quietly. When she sang under her breath I knew she was thinking hard because she only sings when she needs to keep words from spilling out before they\u2019re ready to be caught.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me your dough theory,\u201d she said finally, watching my hands make a well in the flour and then pour the foamy yeast in like a small tide. \u201cWater, heat, pull back and see. Did you write that for the book you\u2019re not writing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wrote it to keep my head from climbing out the window,\u201d I said, pushing in the butter and the eggs and turning the bowl with the heel of my hand. \u201cThough if a book wanted it I wouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d The dough took at first and then fought, the way a skittish animal tests your grip to make sure you\u2019re not lying. I kneaded until it stopped lying to me. I pressed the heel of my hand and lifted and turned and thought about everything my hands have remembered my head has dropped without permission. \u201cI can\u2019t tell where yesterday ends,\u201d I said after a while, because saying nothing makes silence a bully. \u201cI can tell where the oven ended. I can tell where the applause lied politely about how much it meant and then, surprise, meant more. I still can\u2019t tell why there\u2019s a man with a cap in our lives who covers orange juice the way you cover a wounded thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will find out what cap he wears when he thinks no one is looking,\u201d Jill said, and the firmness in her voice made a ridge of comfort lift under my skin. \u201cI talked to the waitress again, away from cameras and managers. He smelled like cologne that\u2019s pretending to be cedar. Not a hotel scent. A person scent. He had a scar on his thumb like he\u2019s cut himself the same way twenty times and didn\u2019t take the hint.\u201d She shook cinnamon into a bowl with brown sugar and a pinch of salt because cinnamon is better when someone interrupts it. \u201cHe will be findable. People like that think they are fog when really they track like a sloppy footprint.\u201d\n\nThere were things we didn\u2019t say and they ran under the surface like fish in a cold river. Our father shaped himself out of the not-said the way fog makes a tree and then lets it go again. A navy cap is a hand-me-down in this part of the world; it could be anyone. It could be a man who buys salted peanuts in gas stations and calls every waitress sweetheart. It could be the person Jill and I used to wait for in the front window when the sky went that particular yellow and we wanted the sound of a truck door and boots on the mat and the smell of oil that meant, for an hour, we were not in charge of comforting ourselves. It could be a stranger with a borrowed cap and a borrowed idea of drama. Truth does not owe you fireworks; sometimes it shows up in a plaid shirt and reminds you to take the garbage out on Wednesday night because that\u2019s when the truck comes.\n\nWe rolled the dough together, which we haven\u2019t done since a September where the light through the maple out back went redder than blood and our mother\u2019s laugh was still attached to our days like a button that might hold. I taught Jill again how to not use too much flour, how to know the exact moment a rolling pin stops being a weapon and starts being a whisper. She taught me again how to breathe with my back when the tightness in my chest wants to graduate up to my throat. We spread the cinnamon sugar and the butter and rolled tight from the long end and pinched like we meant it. I cut with dental floss because knives tear and Jill laughed because it is funny watching a grown woman garrote dough. The spirals looked like time, circles inside circles, nothing entirely original and still the only thing you want to look at for a minute.\n\n\u201cWe have the officer appointment at four,\u201d she said, checking her phone not because it has ever told her something she doesn\u2019t already know but because procedure is a blanket. \u201cWe have the neurologist at two the day after tomorrow. Do you want to see her before the broadcast? She\u2019s going to tell you your brain is a lake with different ice thicknesses and you need to be patient with the spring.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want her cinnamon tea,\u201d I said, and set the pan on the counter and covered it with a clean towel and told the dough to rise and do it evenly, please, like I was talking to a small child I had never met. \u201cAnd I want to ask her if it\u2019s normal to remember confetti like a body memory and not remember a whole person\u2019s face. I want to ask if confetti is bad for neurons.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is bad for neurons if you have trust issues,\u201d Jill said, and put her mouth on my hair for a second the way she did when I was small and had done something I wanted to be punished for so I could stop holding my breath. \u201cEat a half of one when they come out,\u201d she added, because she never does a feeling without a practical instruction. \u201cWe are not visiting anyone\u2019s haircut with low blood sugar.\u201d\n\nWhile the buns rose and swelled and made themselves plump with air they were borrowing, I went into the living room and opened the hamper again as if it could change when I wasn\u2019t looking. The letter had the tone a show uses when it wants you to feel like the tent had kissed your forehead and sent you home with cookies, which it has to because you sign a thing that says they will let you be a story and they will also let you go. The certificate made me laugh because the serif on my legal last name looks like a corner of snow off an eave. There was a photo, face down under the tissue, that I hadn\u2019t noticed. It was the three of us in a row, last year\u2019s final, our faces confetti-baffled into anonymity. Whoever had tucked it in had written in pencil on the back, in a hand that does better with numbers than with curves: all three are real.\n\nI turned it over and didn\u2019t look at the faces, because looking straight at a star is the quickest way to not see it. I let my eyes do the trick they do in museums sometimes, where you pretend you\u2019re interested in the frame and then the painting arrives through a side door in your head. The mouth shape of the person to my left was delicate and stubborn. The line of the jaw of the person to my right was kind. Between us, in a place where cameras love to live, the host\u2019s hand was in the air, his palm shaped like the word Canada. I let the pieces of it talk to each other without me for a minute. Sometimes your understanding shows up late to a conversation and still has the nerve to interrupt.\n\n\u201cAnika,\u201d I said, and the name landed without a splash. \u201cAnika D\u2019Souza. She teaches kindergarten during the week and runs a pop-up at the strip mall on Saturdays. Last year they aired her win in June and her dad cried on television in a shirt that everybody called lucky. Her showstopper had sugar glass for windows and they fogged when she breathed near them, and she wiped one with the hem of her apron, and the camera did not miss it.\u201d\n\nJill looked up from the stove where she was making a glaze the color of something you wish you had had a chance to swim in when you were a kid. She nodded once. \u201cShe sent a thank-you to craft for the cookies. It\u2019s in the binder.\u201d She hesitated and then did the honest thing instead of the easy one. \u201cShe came to the hospital. The night you forgot. She didn\u2019t come in. She sat in the waiting room for an hour and then she went away. She caught my eye when I came out for water and she made a face like an apology that had been sitting in her mouth too long and had started to taste like paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind,\u201d I said, because it is and I needed to say it out loud. \u201cThat\u2019s beyond the NDA protocol kind.\u201d I did not ask why no one had told me then or later because I knew. You triage. You save the person. You leave the story to nod to you at the door and go home with a different person who will sleep because they don\u2019t have to decide what you are to them yet. \u201cDo you think she wrote the note?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe handwriting on the car envelope had a wobble that felt like cold fingers,\u201d Jill said, setting the pan with buns on the counter and making the air do that small shout. \u201cShe lives three provinces east. The paper smelled like someone\u2019s dresser. The hotel note had no perfume at all, which is its own perfume.\u201d She took a fork and nudged a swirl, checking the center for done-ness the way you check a decision. \u201cEat. No heroics.\u201d\n\nThe bun was soft as it looks in cookbooks even though it usually isn\u2019t, because photographers are liars with the best intentions. The glaze stuck to my lip and I licked it without worrying if someone would clip the moment and make me into a particular kind of woman who equates sugar with need because I am none of the kinds of woman cameras try to flatten and also I am all of them. The cinnamon burned in the smallest good way down the back of my throat. My shoulders dropped the part of a shrug they were still carrying. On the radio, a woman with a voice like a real river told a story about a deer that had gotten itself tangled in someone\u2019s Christmas lights and how three neighbors and a teen with dyed hair had solved it without calling anyone official. The teen said, on air, \u201cIt bowed to me,\u201d and laughed in a way that made me sure the deer had, in fact, bowed.\n\nAt two, the neurologist\u2019s office smelled like papers that have been filed and refiled by careful hands and tea that is more cinnamon than leaf. She wore the same cardigan she always wears, a dark blue that makes her look like a library come to life. She doesn\u2019t patronize my brain; she flirts with it. She sets her pen down when she talks to you about your own head, as if she is asking permission to take your pulse. When I told her about the juice and the light that rose behind my eyes and then cracked and poured and the memory of gold that followed, she made the face she makes when she is pleased to have a good metaphor to play with.\n\n\u201cYou know how sugar is supersaturated?\u201d she asked, and because the universe sometimes likes to tickle you in the ribs when you have talked about cages and glass and heat all day, I smiled. \u201cYou dissolve too much into too little water and then you get a clear solution that looks like lenience. You hang a thread in it and crystals collect. You thought you had a liquid. You get a city.\u201d She poured tea and handed it to me and I didn\u2019t reach for the medical words because sometimes the making of a city in your own head is enough. \u201cYou\u2019ve had head trauma. You\u2019ve had a diagnosis I don\u2019t hand out to people who don\u2019t need it. The memory is still there, just\u2026 unhooked from the index. An event, a smell, a chemical change can sometimes put its finger on the card and whisper, Here. Confetti is an excellent card. It is silly and intense and it sticks. Your brain isn\u2019t making things up. It\u2019s picking up a thread.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about a man with a cap who covers a cup?\u201d Jill asked, because she will put her body between me and a word if she thinks the word has a sharp edge. \u201cWhat about the kind of fear that looks like an adrenaline problem and manifests like someone stole a piece of your breath and hid it under a table at a hotel breakfast?\u201d\n\nThe neurologist did not pretend to a police degree she didn\u2019t have. She crossed one leg and the other and nodded. \u201cWe are built to be jumpy,\u201d she said. \u201cYour sister\u2019s body sees fear and chooses a plan. Your body sees fear and remembers something else while choosing a plan. Our job is to make sure you\u2019re safe enough to let the remembering happen without scaring your body into quitting its job. Also, citrus can tilt people. Adrenergic surges tilt people. A sip of juice, a bad night\u2019s sleep, a brain with a soft spot, a person behind you who isn\u2019t your sister, a feeling that someone is photographing your breath\u2014any one thing would be manageable. Together they sound the alarm.\u201d She smiled and it didn\u2019t feel like a trick. \u201cIf you had collapsed into my office I would have given you the same tea and told you the same thing. Your brain is not your enemy. It is also not your most reliable narrator. That\u2019s your job, and you\u2019ve given yourself practice.\u201d\n\nOn the way out, the receptionist pressed a peppermint into my palm the way grandparents used to when they didn\u2019t know how else to feed a kid who didn\u2019t say much. The peppermint tasted like memory and I had the grace to laugh at myself right there under a poster for stroke awareness. In the parking lot, a truck idled in a way that says we don\u2019t trust machines unless they are making noise. A man in a navy cap was sitting in the passenger seat, his elbow on the rolled-down window, his fingers tapping an old rhythm on the door. He lifted his head when we walked by and looked right through us with a politeness that might have been fear wearing manners.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t smell like cedar,\u201d Jill said when we were in the car. \u201cHe smells like chewing tobacco and winter. He smells like home to someone else.\u201d She turned the key and we did the small city choreography of yielding and insisting. \u201cHe\u2019s not ours.\u201d\n\nAt the caf\u00e9 on Ross Street, the barista with the green hair spotted me and lifted both her arms in a V that made everybody in the room look at me and then look away because Canadians are not allowed more than two seconds of public attention at a time without a chalkboard and a raffle ticket. She poured me a coffee without asking and then leaned across the counter in a way that would have made our mother cough but would make any young person proud.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, whispering exaggeratedly because she does not actually know how to whisper. \u201cI saw you from the TV internet and I will not talk about it unless you want me to, but I will say I am, like, resonating in your direction. Also, there was a guy in a cap. Not, like, the aesthetic cap, but a cap, cap. He came yesterday after you left. He asked if Ms. Lumen is your real name or your fake name and I said, like, obviously real because your whole vibe is nightlight. He said he wanted to leave a gift and I was like, you can leave in general. I told him to write it down and he did. I threw it out because it tasted like creep. Sorry if it was actual information.\u201d\n\n\u201cDescribe his cap,\u201d Jill said, and the girl did, with a precision that made me want to offer her a job in intelligence and also a scone. Blue. Frayed at the back. Not a team. Not a brand. The brim stained on the underside like he had used it to wipe his hands when he needed to look less dirty.\n\n\u201cHe said your book changed his wife\u2019s life,\u201d she added, and then saw it land and flushed. \u201cI know you don\u2019t have a book yet. He said it anyway. He looked like he lies for a living but also like he might not know when he is doing it because it feels like a blanket.\u201d\n\nI put two dollars in the tip jar, which is an insult and I knew it; I put another ten because I know how hurt can make you cheap and I have been trying to feed the part of me that wants to do better. We took the corner table and I put my back where I could see the door and not in the habit of doing that felt like a second language I had acquired without effort. I took out the green notebook because a person who doesn\u2019t write down the shape of their fear will find it getting bigger when they sleep. I wrote down cap, cedar, cedar-not, the shape of a thumb scar, the way voices change when the memory you get back is a relief disguised in a crisis. I wrote down Anika\u2019s name because gratitude is easier to feel if you give it letters. I wrote down our mother\u2019s name, which I almost never do, because it behaves like sourdough starter in a warm kitchen: it grows when you feed it and it makes the whole place smell like life.\n\nThe officers with the haircuts were at the kitchen table at four with a notepad that had coffee ring hierarchy printed into its corners and pens that click like turning a light on and off. They were kind in the way people are kind when they think you have something they need and they\u2019re not going to get it unless you are on their side. They asked me to tell them the story the way you ask someone who has done a magic trick to do it again but slower. I told them about the breakfast juice and the light and Jill\u2019s hand and the carpet and the way fear can sit in your body and ask for a chair. I told them about the envelope in the car and the handwriting that had made my shoulder blades itch with recognition without actually handing me a face to attach it to. I told them about the waitress and the cap and the thumb, and they nodded at the right places like they\u2019ve learned to do in a training where actors pretend to be sad.\n\n\u201cDo you have any reason to think someone would want to keep you from competing?\u201d the older one asked, using the verb want like it was hand-stitched. \u201cAnyone who thinks your success will cost them something? Anyone who thinks your presence affects the integrity of the show? Sometimes people mislay their manners when cameras are involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople mislay their manners when nothing is involved,\u201d Jill said, and the officer did not argue, which made me like him better. \u201cThe show\u2019s compliance team told us your compliance team told them to tell us not to have contact with last year\u2019s finalists. They also told us they think they allowed for a loophole that puts my sister in a bracket nobody thought to define. You\u2019re going to find a lot of people with opinions. You\u2019re going to find fewer with evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about family?\u201d the younger one said, not in an accusatory way, more like a person stepping lightly onto ice that will either hold or won\u2019t. \u201cAnyone who has a quarrel with the name on your paperwork? Anyone who wants you to remember differently or remember them first?\u201d\n\nThe room changed shape around that question the way a loaf changes shape if you slash it too deep before it goes into the oven. I could feel the air rearrange itself, and the weight of our mother\u2019s absence made a paler hole and the weight of our father\u2019s particular kind of presence pressed lightly on the edge of the tablecloth. I do not like lying. I do not like telling truths I don\u2019t own yet either. \u201cWe have a father,\u201d I said carefully. \u201cHe has a cap. He has opinions about how people should and should not present themselves to a world that might want to comment. He left before the part where people get good at making up after. He is not a person who buys a hotel lanyard to make his life more interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a father,\u201d Jill echoed with a small break in her voice that she ironed with the back of her hand because you can do that, if you start young. \u201cHe could fill this room with attention without moving his feet. When he wants to be seen he uses his whole face. If that man was trying to be unseen, he isn\u2019t ours.\u201d\n\nThey took down names I gave them and names I did not give them and names they would make for themselves when they filed this and then forgot it and then remembered it when it intersected with something louder. They took the envelope from the car and promised to call if the lab proved it had anything more interesting to tell me than lavender and time. The older one looked at the buns on the counter in a way that made me want to feed him like a stray cat and I did, because feeding people is one of the only things I know how to do that consistently feels like a solution. He ate slowly and with respect, and when he left he said my pen name because he\u2019d looked it up on his phone while pretending to check for messages. The younger one put a card where the note had been, a kind of replacement magic.\n\nNight is a different animal in a house where someone has recently put confetti in the trash. It rustles. It thinks it has earned the right to remind you that it knows how to be louder than you. I walked through the rooms and touched the backs of chairs and the edges of doorways and the kitchen table with my fingertips like I was taking its pulse. Jill took a shower and the water hit the tile in a pattern I could have written down in notation if I had that kind of brain. I sat on the floor in front of the couch and pulled the hamper toward me again because I am not done with things until they stop humming.\n\nUnder the maple syrup bottle and the tissue and the silly gold stand-in trophy that was heavier than embarrassment, there was a card I hadn\u2019t seen, slipped between the measuring spoons like it wanted them to make the discovery instead of me. It was on cheap cardstock and the ink had bled a bit, the way ink does when it meets a hand that has held it too long. It said: you made my mother cry, which I would have put aside as either troll or compliment if not for what was under it. A pressed sprig of lavender, not from a hotel lobby arrangement, but from a bush that has survived three winters and decided not to die out of sheer obstinacy. It stained the tissue in a vein the shape of a road I have yet to learn by heart.\n\nI put it back because I don\u2019t like to finish mysteries I cannot ask questions to, and also because it made me want to call a person whose number I don\u2019t have. It pressed up against a part of my chest that had gotten used to hollowness. I thought of girls who learn to carry chest cavities like Tupperware. I thought of women who learn to carry other people\u2019s containers and snacks and shame and never say no. I thought of my mother, and of a day where the wind had sounded like it had teeth, and of everything we got good at surviving and everything we still refuse to.\n\nThe knock at the door was not polite. It was the kind that taps a rhythm that is older than you and expects you to recognize it because it has been in your house before. Jill froze in the hallway with her hair in a towel and her feet bare and her face clean and naked in a way that made her look like both of us before we learned our thin-blooded calm. I stood because you stand for some names even if you don\u2019t say them. I put my hand on the table, then the chair, then the doorknob, because touching wood and metal is a way of reminding yourself you live in a world where physics applies.\n\nWhen I opened the door, the winter moved a foot into the hallway like a person who is sure of themselves and still too polite to push past. The man on the porch had a navy cap that had been run through too many summers and not enough washing machines. He held it in his hands, which I took as a sign he had either used his manners tonight or had learned to perform them. His jacket was the kind of brown that stores oil stains like secrets. He had the eyes that belong to the people we come from in this place, the ones the color of soil that is good for something if you put the time in. His mouth was our mother\u2019s mouth, which is an unfair trick biology plays when it wants to mess with you. He looked at me like he had been practicing not to look at me while still making sure I knew the practice was for my benefit.\n\n\u201cKid,\u201d he said, and the word entered the house like it had been waiting at the door the whole time, stamping its feet against the cold, and I felt the floor tilt and settle, and behind me Jill made a noise a paramedic only makes when she is not at work and the person in front of her is either down or about to be.He said it the way men say it when the word has done too much work for them and they don\u2019t know where else to put their hands. The cap sat between his palms like a small animal he\u2019d trapped accidentally. Heat from the house met the cold at his back and made a little fog around his shoulders, and I had the odd, disloyal thought that weather had always loved him more than we had because it never asked him to apologize for anything. Jill tightened the towel on her head like a helmet and took two silent steps toward the door without deciding if she meant to let him in or turn him away. I moved aside because I have been practicing the part of me that doesn\u2019t decide for other people when the air in a room changes.\n\nHe looked smaller than the version of him my body keeps in storage for emergencies. The jacket tugged at one shoulder as if gravity had signed a contract with his bones. His hair had gone from the color of wheat at the end of a season to the color of rope left out in the sun for years, and the skin around his eyes had the map of a man who squints for a living at horizons that do not move. \u201cYou going to leave me on the step?\u201d he asked, and his voice had the riverbed of apology in it without any water yet. \u201cOr you going to let me say the thing that\u2019s been chewing on me for a day and a half?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoots,\u201d Jill said, and stood back in a way that was not consent so much as triage. \u201cOn the tray. If there is salt on them, you wipe it yourself. You do not drip on her floor.\u201d\n\nHe obeyed, which would have been funny in a different decade. He set the cap on the radiator like a head that needed warming and stamped off the last of the porch. The smell came with him, not cedar and performance, but oil, cold metal, the sweet stale of a cab where someone eats their lunch with the window cracked because they don\u2019t trust the seals. There was tobacco under it, not chewing, not smoke, the ghost of a habit carried by other men he used to stand beside. He kept his eyes down until he didn\u2019t, and when he raised them, they found the places in my face that match his and stayed there too long.\n\n\u201cI seen you,\u201d he said, and gestured vaguely at the part of the house that holds the television, as if fame were a farm implement he could pick up and examine when it stopped by. \u201cTwice. Once last year and I wasn\u2019t supposed to make a fuss, and once yesterday, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I was supposed to make any noise at all. I figured it out when the weather went to hell in my chest. You\u2019re not asleep in it anymore. That\u2019s good. I brought\u2026 I didn\u2019t bring flowers.\u201d He looked at his hands like he\u2019d meant to surprise us and had surprised himself. \u201cI brought this.\u201d\n\nHe fumbled in the pocket of the jacket and came out with something wrapped in newspaper and bound with twine that had been tied by someone who has short patience for knots. He untied it and unrolled the paper on the kitchen table with care that fought his bones, then stood back like a magician who doesn\u2019t like the attention part. It was a photograph in a plastic frame the color of tea, the kind you get in a drugstore because you don\u2019t go into places where clerks ask you questions. My mother was in it, in her red sweater that throws a net over my heart every time I see it, hair up in a way you\u2019d call careless if you hadn\u2019t watched her do it with absolute attention. She held a pie with both hands like it was the only baby she had ever agreed to carry. The porch behind her was the porch of the house before this one, peeling paint in strips that looked like someone had tried to take the sky off. My father was in the corner of the frame, cut off at the shoulder, his hand visible, steadying the pan, his thumb a little too close to the heat and not minding.\n\n\u201cI found it behind the toolbox,\u201d he said, and looked at me because he knows how to find a useful prop when he\u2019s come unarmed. \u201cI took it when we moved and I meant to give it back when you were settled and then I forgot where I put it and then I forgot how to knock like a person who doesn\u2019t expect to be told to get back in his truck. I thought maybe she\u2019d want to be in the house with you when you\u2014\u201d He lifted his chin toward the counter where the hamper sat like proof and like a joke. \u201cWhen you brought trouble home.\u201d\n\nJill snorted softly and then turned it into a cough because somewhere along the way she learned how to keep blood in and sound out. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you called it when you left,\u201d she said, and he met her with a look that didn\u2019t dodge so much as accept a punch.\n\n\u201cI called it leaving before I did something we couldn\u2019t fix,\u201d he said, and I could feel the room recognize his particular talent of saying the thing that wins and costs him at once. \u201cTurns out that\u2019s still doing something you can\u2019t fix. I ain\u2019t here to argue my way into your good graces. I\u2019m here because your sister sent me a message like a siren wrapped in a napkin. She said someone tried to scare you back into sleeping and it didn\u2019t take. She said there\u2019s a man thinks caps make him invisible.\u201d He bent and put two fingers on the photograph the way people used to swear on a Bible. \u201cI don\u2019t like men who think that. I been that man. He is not me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen were you at the hospital?\u201d I asked, because it seems I have decided I will commit to the worst angle in a photograph if it gets me closer to what a thing is. \u201cJill says you make a room full of attention without moving your feet. Did you mend yourself small and sit under a painting and wait for the tilt of a door?\u201d\n\nHe made the face he makes when he has to choose between lying and not talking. \u201cThe night they told me you didn\u2019t know your name,\u201d he said, and looked past me for the first time like the wall had something to say to him that wasn\u2019t my face. \u201cI stood outside the sliding doors and I didn\u2019t come in because I was mad at everybody who knew how to say it like they weren\u2019t proud of the sound. I went to the park by the statue with the eagle and I sat on a bench with a coffee and I hated myself for twenty minutes and then I got up and went to the desk and said your name and the girl there was nineteen and had a smile like a knife, and she said, \u2018She has her sister,\u2019 and I turned around and left because I ain\u2019t never been good at being the second best helper in a room.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have also never been good at being the first,\u201d Jill said, but the edge in her voice softened a fraction, because there are sentences that let your shoulders drop without your permission and this was one of them. \u201cWho is he?\u201d she asked, and the he in her mouth had a sound the air knows to attach to a stranger with a bad idea. \u201cThe one at the hotel. Cedar cologne. Thumb scar. He held the cup like it was a coin he was putting on someone\u2019s eyelids.\u201d\n\nMy father looked at the radiator where the cap lay like a small animal that had decided it would not be tamed. He took it in his hands again and turned it once the way you turn a problem to see if there\u2019s a door you missed. \u201cCould be a dozen men I know and none of them,\u201d he said slowly, as if moving heavy words from one side of his mouth to the other and weighing them. \u201cCould be a hand from the yard over on the south road. Could be a cousin to the man runs the tow out at the second bridge. Could be a customer from the parts store who thinks we\u2019re friends because I know the part number he needs without looking. You want me to make it easy and say Walt. You want me to say Hank. I don\u2019t have a Hank to give you that would make your mouth look less like your mother\u2019s when she decided not to cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you put under my windshield,\u201d I asked, and his eyes sharpened the smallest bit, which is how I know I had walked into a room he had thought was locked. \u201cEnvelope in the car. Brown. My names on it like someone couldn\u2019t choose which one to be mad at.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t reach for innocence like a rag. He set the cap down again and put his palms flat on the table and stared at the knuckles that look like mine. \u201cI wrote you in July,\u201d he said, the month the mouth you keep for winter tries and fails to say like a song. \u201cCold fingers, yeah, because I don\u2019t keep paper in the house the way your mother did and I found a stub in the glove box and a pencil that had been chewed by something with small teeth. I wrote \u2018Remember, please,\u2019 because I couldn\u2019t think of anything with manners that didn\u2019t sound like a command. I left it on your car three times and took it back off once because I saw you coming out with your hair up and your face like a woman walking between rooms in her own house and I got scared you\u2019d look up and see me and make a sound I couldn\u2019t live under.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat were you asking me to remember?\u201d I said, and the question came out softer than I expected, which is what happens when you go in braced for a punch and find a place to sit down instead. \u201cThe tent? The show? Your existence? Hers?\u201d I touched the photograph and the plastic clicked under my fingernail. \u201cWhat debt did you think I owed the past that it was mine to pay with what I had left?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat summer,\u201d he said, and his voice hoarded the heat the radiator threw off. \u201cThere was a day you came by the yard with a pie you\u2019d cooled by the window like in a joke and you gave it to the boys and me because you were mad at me for something and you didn\u2019t want to say it like words. You said it like butter. They ate it with their hands like dogs and said thank you without swallowing, and I watched you hold their hunger like it was nothing and like it was something that might kill you if you put it down wrong. I wanted you to know that wasn\u2019t for nothing. I wanted you to remember that before a camera said you were a thing, you were one. I wanted you to remember me saying it. I haven\u2019t made a lot of good sentences in my life. I wanted one.\u201d\n\nJill loosened her towel and let her hair fall because something in his words had reached past the part of her that keeps the doors closed and found the couch. She looked at me and I looked at her and we did the small math we have always done quickly, weighing mercy against pattern, safety against need. \u201cYou didn\u2019t write the hotel note,\u201d she said, and my father shook his head in a way that made muscle ripple down the side of his jaw. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell a girl to carry a tray in after being told not to.\u201d He shook his head again. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me you know who did,\u201d she added, and he stopped moving and put a breath back in his chest.\n\n\u201cI know men who like the way fear looks on a mouth,\u201d he said, choosing every word like he was being charged for them. \u201cI know men who carry lanyards and learn a smile that does the same job whether it\u2019s honest or not. I know a man who thinks he makes television and really he makes his own story about how he\u2019s the kind who can. But I don\u2019t have a name that fits your juice. I have a feeling, and that\u2019s a bad thing to bring to a house where women make a living with their hands. I brought the picture because I knew you\u2019d be able to forgive the past easier than you can forgive the present.\u201d\n\nI thought about every time I\u2019ve grated butter against a bowl and pretended I wasn\u2019t asking the world for a favor. I thought about the way my grandmother used to tie her apron strings with a knot that held even when you tried to make it not, and the way my mother would lick a thumb and press the corner of a child\u2019s mouth and say, there, without looking to see if it helped. \u201cDid you watch last year,\u201d I asked, and it felt like putting a hand into a hive. \u201cDid you watch the confetti. Did you sit there and say that\u2019s my kid, and did you do it out loud in a room with no one in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI watched all three,\u201d he said without flinching, giving me the decoy truth and the real one in one parcel. \u201cI watched them all and swore at the host and told the man to his face that he was full of himself even though he couldn\u2019t hear me. I watched the one where they said your name and I stood up so fast I knocked over a coffee and told the trailer I\u2019d built with my own hands I was sorry for yelling in it. Then I turned it off because I know how stories work when they\u2019ve got bills to pay, and I waited for my phone to ring and set on the table and didn\u2019t answer it when it did because I didn\u2019t know whether you would know you had been happy. I didn\u2019t want to be the person who broke it if you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI rested my forehead against the door for a second because sometimes wood will hold the part of your head that needs holding more tenderly than a hand. The quiet grew a spine. \u201cDo you know about the box,\u201d I said, and he smiled with the corner of his mouth that looks like mine and then like Jill\u2019s and then like a stranger\u2019s I would trust because he told the truth about his tools.\n\n\u201cI put it in the garage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came while you were at your sister\u2019s, and I didn\u2019t want some kid to lift it off your step because they thought it might have something shiny in it. I thought you\u2019d be back in two hours or two days and then you weren\u2019t, and I made a joke at the post office about how the television owes people better packaging and the girl there told me I was being old. I wrote you \u2018remember\u2019 because I couldn\u2019t stand the idea that the person who carried that tinsel home in her hair would fold a piece of paper over it and put it on a shelf and call it someone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nJill put two bowls on the table like she was dealing cards, because food is how we buy time when ideas show up that require different shoes. She sat and gestured at the chairs and looked like a captain letting a mutinous crew decide whether they wanted to live. \u201cSit,\u201d she said to him, and it sounded like a dare and a permission. \u201cEat what she made. Then tell us why you really came, because no one drives in January to bring back a picture unless they are either dying or trying not to. And you look like a man who has decided not to.\u201d\n\nHe sat, and the chair made the small complaint the old ones make because they used to belong to air and now they have to hold people. He ate the cinnamon bun as if someone had taught him finally, late in his life, that you can say thank you without your mouth being empty, and a part of me that has been mean to him for years because meanness is easier than the alternative took a step back. He wiped the glaze from his knuckle with his thumb and looked at it like it might tell him his blood type. \u201cI came because a man left a note on my truck at the yard yesterday,\u201d he said at last, and Jill\u2019s body leaned forward an inch in a way no one would see but me because I am fluent in her. \u201cNot a note like mine. Printed. With a phone number that didn\u2019t have enough numbers. It said, \u2018Tell her to sit this one out. You don\u2019t want to be sorry twice.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe word twice found all my soft places and pressed. Somewhere under the floor the furnace turned over and went back to work without waiting for permission. \u201cWho hates us economically,\u201d I asked, because there are only so many stories in a small city and you learn to label them so they don\u2019t talk to each other at night. \u201cWho loses money if I stand at a counter and make something that doesn\u2019t burn. Who thinks fear will make me polite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can make a list,\u201d he said, and the light in his eyes went the color it gets when he decides a thing is worth doing because he has finally found a way to name it. \u201cIt will be longer than you like and shorter than you think. There ain\u2019t an army of men in hats lined up to keep you from sugaring your own mouth, kid. But there are always two or three who get a kick out of convincing the women they used to sit next to that they\u2019d be prettier quiet. It could be someone from the show who saw last year and thinks this year makes a map of their own smallness. It could be someone from here who doesn\u2019t like that the TV told you your name for you. It could be a man who sells maple syrup at the farmer\u2019s market and hates being corrected about sugar stages. It could be nobody, and the juice was a coincidence, and you\u2019re all right, and I\u2019ll go home and yell at a truck.\u201d\n\nI looked at Jill and saw the way the muscle in her cheek had started to let go. \u201cWe file this,\u201d she said in the cadence of a job she trusts. \u201cWe tell the haircuts. We tell production. We keep copies of the copies in a place where water can\u2019t find them. We do not drink anything we didn\u2019t open with our own two hands for the foreseeable future, which is a shame because that girl at the caf\u00e9 makes a London Fog that could talk you into buying a house. We let him make his list if he wants to behave like a citizen instead of a dramatic person with a cap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a dramatic person with a cap,\u201d he said, and it made me want to laugh in a way that would have broken something if I\u2019d let it out too hard. \u201cI\u2019m also tired of being useless. I came to tell you to tell me to do something, and to ask you to forgive me for the days I was the problem when I thought I was the solution. I don\u2019t need you to pat my hand and I don\u2019t need to move in and fix your stair that squeaks. I need to be told where to stand and who to call if they come back and try to make you small.\u201d\n\nI stood because sitting makes me gentle and I did not want gentle for a second. I took the photograph, not because I wanted sage domesticity in a plastic frame but because I wanted my mother\u2019s mouth in the room when I said what I was going to say. I set it on the counter next to the hamper so the two moments that had tried to topple me these past days could look at each other and decide whether they were going to fight or flirt. \u201cStand where Jill tells you,\u201d I said. \u201cCall the number with not enough numbers and laugh into the phone and then hang up. Ask the waitress at the hotel what she needs to sleep well and deliver it to her in a way that doesn\u2019t make her think you expect her to thank you for witchcraft. Go to the yard and tell the men that if they know anyone who wears cedar who doesn\u2019t work at a tree farm, they should give you a name and you will do something useful with it. Do not come to the tent. If I look up and see you, I will forget to tell my hands to be kind.\u201d\n\nHe tipped his head in a way I had only ever seen him do outside when the geese flew in the wrong direction and he did not think much of their plan. \u201cFair,\u201d he said, and stood, and put his cap back on not like armor but like a signal. \u201cI\u2019ll go before I start saying something that will make you push me down the stairs. I\u2019ll leave the picture, if you will let me, and I\u2019ll pretend I was invited and I won\u2019t tell the men at the yard that I cried like an idiot when the gold fell on your head and I wasn\u2019t there to wipe it off your mouth like your mother would have with her sleeve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can tell them,\u201d Jill said, and he looked at her as if she had handed him a tool he hadn\u2019t known he needed. \u201cYou can tell anyone you want. You can tell the woman at the post office. You can tell the parts guy with the old hands. You can tell yourself when you get up to pee at three in the morning and you don\u2019t like the window because it feels like someone\u2019s watching. You can tell the truck.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and did a small half-turn that meant he was going to reach for me and then remembered I am not someone you reach for without being asked. We let him leave with the kind of silence that would have made our mother come into the room to break it, and when the door closed and the winter resumed being an honest animal, I picked up the photograph again and looked at the place where his hand held the pan with the pie without flinching. There is a lot to be said about grip, and what people think they are steadying when they put their fingers near your heat. Sometimes it\u2019s the thing. Sometimes it\u2019s themselves. Sometimes it\u2019s the space between you that neither of you wants to lose.\n\nWe cleaned after like people who have decided to call a room back from a version of itself they don\u2019t like. Jill took the bowls to the sink and made hot water sound like a decision. I folded the towel from her hair and put it on the back of the chair and told it not to fall off. The confetti we hadn\u2019t vacuumed yet glittered at the edge of the mat like the party that had learned to take a hint and leave the last of itself on the way out. When I went to put the photograph on the shelf near the cookbooks, a curl of paper slid from behind the frame and landed face down on the counter with the lazy, guilty flop of a fish that knows it has been seen. It was not the picture\u2019s backing. It was a receipt from the general store outside of town, stale bread and a bolt for something I don\u2019t own, two years old by the date, and on the back, in my mother\u2019s hand, the small grocery list handwriting that could fit a week of meals on a margin. It said sugar, and under it, not in the same hand, smaller, you. I touched the y with my finger and felt it rise.\n\nThe phone buzzed on the table like it had been politely waiting not to interrupt a family scene and had lost its manners. The number was blocked, which is a little theatrical for daylight, and I looked at Jill and she nodded, and I answered because I am done running from rings. The voice was a woman\u2019s, lower than I expected, the kind of careful you get when you make your living telling people how to stop their mouths from lying to them. She gave a first name and did not give a last, and my brain, the part that keeps files and smells and cross-references, rolled its drawers out and brought me the clipboard from the tent, the contact sheet with names circled twice, the wardrobe assistant with the velvet blazer and the tattoo of thyme on her wrist.\n\n\u201cI think he thought he was helping you,\u201d she said without preamble, and that he was he cracked open the room as efficiently as a crowbar. \u201cThe one with the cap. The wrong lanyard. He got it from us. Not on purpose, but because we gave the wrong person the right smile. He said he was family. He said he had something that would level the field. I gave him a pass because he said your name like he was trying it on a tooth. It is my job not to be tricked by the way people say things. He tricked me anyway. I am calling to say I am sorry. I am calling to say I quit.\u201d\n\nJill put her hand on the table, flat, like she was asking the wood to share its calm. I closed my eyes because sometimes you savor a voice better in darkness, and also because faces can make an apology feel heavier than it has to be. \u201cDid he say a name,\u201d I asked, keeping my voice where it can be kind and still ask for what it needs. \u201cDid he say why levelling a field involves juice. Did he say niece and misjudge the age of a demographic he doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018she thinks she won last year,\u2019\u201d the woman said, and the phrase arranged itself in my head with a thud. \u201cHe said, \u2018she should have sat down then and not gotten back up.\u2019 He said, \u2018make sure she doesn\u2019t get too much sugar before cameras,\u2019 which, now that I repeat it, is nothing but a sentence a person crafts when they think they are clever. He did not give a name I believe. He gave a smile my mother would have washed out with soap. He had a scar on his thumb that had closed in a way that says he does not let things heal correctly. I am telling you because I don\u2019t want you to think your fear is a story you invented to keep yourself interesting. It is ordinary. It has a face. We will find it again and make it be ordinary somewhere else.\u201d\n\nAfter we hung up, I wrote the word ordinary in my notebook because it is sometimes harder and braver than extraordinary and no one ever asks you to explain why you want it. I wrote call wardrobe, note apology, thumb scar, niece, level the field, and then I wrote sugar and under it, you, and then, in a different corner, I wrote remember, not as a command but as a verb that could be used for stitching. The house made its small night noises and the buns in the kitchen gave up their last warmth to the air. Outside, the snow had decided to be honest. The geese did not fly because there was nowhere to go that wasn\u2019t here.\n\nI went to bed with the photograph propped on the dresser where it could see me and I could see it without looking at it. The note that had travelled under my pillow for two days lived for a few hours in the drawer with socks because even talismans need to clock out. In the sleep that came, the tent was not a tent for once, but a room like my kitchen, and the judges came in without lights and with real faces and told me they were very tired of confetti and could we please try feathers once, and I said no because I am allergic, and they laughed the way people laugh when they have been awake for three days on purpose and are about to forgive the world for doing weather at them. In the middle of the night I woke not in panic but because the house had remembered something and needed to tell me. I lay there and let it, the pipes whispering their small codes, the hum of the fridge like the breath of an animal sleeping on the other side of the door, and I understood that the rest of the chapter would not be written by me alone, that there were other hands in it, some with scars, some with rings, some with thumbs with ink on them still. It did not make me less afraid. It made me capable of being afraid without inviting fear in for coffee.Chapter 9\n\nMorning came in like a friend who doesn\u2019t bother to knock, and I didn\u2019t mind. The house had a new gravity with the photograph propped on the dresser and the fake trophy on the counter and the envelope from the car stowed in a drawer I had to open twice before I trusted it to hold anything tender. Jill made oatmeal as if she had invented it and apologized to no one for the way she salted the pot. I took my coffee to the back step and watched a magpie bully the light out of a patch of snow until it decided to be water again, and the sight made me want to forgive every bird that has ever taken a shine to what wasn\u2019t theirs. When Jill joined me, she brought a blanket and spread it over our knees like we were old women doing the kind of gossip that keeps small towns alive, and we didn\u2019t talk because silence felt like a clean plate between us. The note from wardrobe had not burned a hole in my pocket, which impressed me; an apology that didn\u2019t ask for absolution had the courtesy to sit quietly and wait its turn. The neurologist\u2019s tea still lived in my mouth like a good ghost, and the word ordinary kept drifting through my head in a way that made me think of men who never learned to make their beds and of women who did and weren\u2019t thanked.\n\nWe did the kind of cleaning you do when you\u2019ve had visitors you didn\u2019t plan for, collecting the stubborn confetti with tape and a practiced flick because brooms simply spread chaos around with a better attitude. The hamper had a way of attracting fingerprints every time I passed it, which felt like a joke and also like a reminder not to curate my own past into something that couldn\u2019t be smudged. When I put the measuring spoons into the drawer with the ones that had belonged to my mother, they made a sound that could have been an argument or could have been a greeting, and I chose greeting because the world is easier when people are meeting each other for the first time and not relitigating old chores. Jill took a call from production and her voice did its I am being reasonable song while she said words like chain of custody and hotel security and we do not consent to spin. When she hung up, she pressed the heel of her hand to her forehead and said the word optics like someone who knows what it costs to be photographed without wanting to be a photo. I said we could turn our phones face down for a while and she smiled like I\u2019d remembered our language.\n\nAnika called at ten after eleven, and the name on the screen made my breath behave like a rabbit under a porch. I answered in the tone you use for people you have missed without admitting you were missing them, which was rude because I hadn\u2019t earned missing her yet. Her voice was lower than the clips, warmer, with a kindness she wasn\u2019t performing for anyone\u2019s arc. She didn\u2019t tell me she\u2019d come to the hospital; she didn\u2019t have to because Jill had put the sash on that story, but her first sentence made the room wider. She said, \u201cI made the same dome again last night because my hands were missing the noise,\u201d and I laughed because it was a silly thing to do and exactly the kind of thing I understood. We talked about sugar like gossip and about decoy endings like weather, and she told me her father had framed a newspaper page and put it in the bedroom even though her mother said it was weird, and then her mother cried again when the cat knocked it down and chipped the glass.\n\nWhen she asked if the lavender had arrived, I told her about the card tucked in the hamper and the sprig that had stained the tissue in a vein, and her breath caught in a way that made distance smaller. She said it wasn\u2019t hers, that she had thought about sending something but stopped because the letter from production had been written in a voice that told people how to be careful, and she is very good at doing as she\u2019s told until she isn\u2019t. Someone at craft has a teenage daughter who thinks the tent is a church, she said, and I told her about the producer\u2019s kid, and we marveled briefly at how the children were getting the point while the adults were busy doing paperwork. When she asked if I had watched last year yet, I told her no because I wanted the confetti in my head to be mine a little longer, and she said that was fair even though she had the right to put a hand on my shoulder and tell me to look. Before we hung up, she said, \u201cIf you want to come east when the roads are sure of themselves, I have a spare bed and a drawer you can put your notebook in,\u201d and I wrote the city name down with a circle around it in a part of the page that looked like an invitation.\n\nWe drove out to the general store from the receipt because I have learned to follow the small threads that present themselves without pretending I am above string. The road was the kind that makes winter look like a habit, ruts in all the same places, a stubborn stand of trees that huddled like conspirators and then got distracted by the sun. The store\u2019s bell did its ceremonial clang when we went in, and the air had the smell of rubber boots and cinnamon-scented brooms and stale sugar that has made peace with its fate. The clerk had a face like someone who could convince you to buy a jar of pickled something and then put the money back in your pocket while you were distracted by a puppy. When we showed her the receipt and asked if she recognized the handwriting on the back, she tilted her head with the care of a person who doesn\u2019t traffic in certainty unless she has to. She said the bolt was probably for a gate that will hang wrong anyway and the bread was the day-old that only people with good teeth buy. She said three men come in smelling like cedar and none of them look like they sleep well, and all three have scars because life here is generous with them.\n\nOn the corkboard near the coffee machine was an ad for the same \u201cAffordable. Discreet.\u201d service that had been circled on the clipping in my car, but here it was complete, a phone number that rolled off the tongue as if someone had chosen it while thinking about late-night radio. The name was Blue Heron Retrievals, which made me want to smile because herons do not retrieve so much as stand very still and let the world forget they are there until they strike. When I called, a voice mail informed me I had reached a service that finds what other people misplace, and the beep that followed was the sound of an invitation to be foolish. I didn\u2019t leave a message because even people who tell the truth for a living sometimes know to keep a story in their pocket until it ripens. Jill wrote the number down and the clerk slid us a small bag of caramels with a wink as if to say, here, have a useful lie to practice on.\n\nAt home, the day lay down like a dog finally convinced we weren\u2019t going anywhere. I made soup because even glory gets tired and wants to sit with broth, and Jill pretended to do paperwork while keeping an eye on the driveway like it held a secret she was ready to be bored by. The father-shaped silence in the house wasn\u2019t leaden; it was the quiet you get after weather hits and the sky remembers it has other jobs. Around three the light did that thing where it turns the edges of things honest and you can see how corners are really round, and I took down my grandmother\u2019s apron and put it on even though I wasn\u2019t baking. The fabric has faded in a way that tells you where the work was done and where it was mostly for show, and the strings remembered the knot before I did.\n\nWe did not plan a watch party because the thought of people watching my face while I watched my face made me feel like a cat asked to look in a mirror. The caf\u00e9 offered to put the episode on a screen for anyone who wanted to clap at appropriate times and be discreet about their tears, because Green Hair knows how feelings behave when there is steamed milk involved. We said later, and she texted Jill, traitor, with a string of knife and heart emojis that somehow read as affection. Instead, when the hour rolled around, we sat on the couch and turned the volume down until the judges\u2019 voices sounded like other people\u2019s parents in the next room arguing about pie. The opening montage did its usual tricks and somehow found footage of me tying my apron as if I were putting on a cape, which told me production had learned me efficiently.\n\nThe edit was kind but not soft, which is to say they let me have mistakes without putting balloons around them. They showed my hands on the dough and my smile doing that thing it does when I\u2019m inside an idea and only remember at the very end that other people exist. They didn\u2019t mention last year with anything more than a raised eyebrow and a line about d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, which was merciful, and when they got to the orange juice they did not get to the orange juice because cameras had not been there. The producers were good at making absence look like choice, which is a skill I wish nobody needed. When the judges called my name near the end, the part of me that had been braced for a blow let go of the doorframe and came into the room. Gold paper rained out of the TV with the decorum of confetti that knows it is not biodegradable, and the sound it made when it hit the floor in my living room was nothing, because of course it couldn\u2019t travel, and that felt exactly right.\n\nMy phone ticked with messages like a patient monitor with a sense of humor. Some were from people who had borrowed sugar from me and regretted giving it back; some were from names I recognized with the same feeling you get of seeing your own town under snow and remembering where the sidewalks are. There was one from a publisher whose logo looks like a bird deciding whether or not to migrate this year, and the subject line said, Your voice is hungry, which made me laugh because it was a dumb line and also because it wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t open it because I wanted to sit in the unmarketable version of my life for a few more hours, the one where my sister complained that confetti was going to clog the vacuum and I argued that glitter has rights.\n\nWhen the credits rolled, I turned the sound up so we could hear the part where they list the departments and the names of the people whose hands I have memorized before their faces. The wardrobe assistant\u2019s name was there, solid and unadorned, and I hoped her resignation would be the kind where she left with her dignity packed carefully between two sweaters and not the kind where someone put her keys on a hook and closed the door too fast. The medic got a shout-out, which is not usual, and I suspected someone in post was making a case for bodies behaving strangely under lights. The craft services team earned a heart in my notebook because they always do, and I wrote their names down like a charm.\n\nAfter, the house exhaled like it had been listening through the walls. Jill set the plates in the sink and didn\u2019t wash them, which is how I knew she was tired because she washes to think and she dries to punish herself for washing. We both watched the window because our father has always announced his return by leaning on the horn as if he were starring in a parade, but he did not lean, he did not knock, and I chose to be grateful instead of suspicious. I was putting the kettle on when my phone vibrated again with a number I didn\u2019t recognize, and the little dog in the back of my head, the one that has to decide whether to bark at every rustle, lifted its head but didn\u2019t bark.\n\nIt was a man\u2019s voice, not the cap\u2019s, careful the way people get when they\u2019re trying to undo a mistake with tone. He said his name as if it should mean something and it didn\u2019t, and then he put words together with the same anxiety I use when I\u2019m trying to fold in whipped cream without losing volume. He said he had been the one to hire Blue Heron Retrievals for a task last year that was not recovered property but rather recovered dignity, and he had given them the show\u2019s filming schedule and a roster without intending harm. He said he had thought he was protecting an investment, which he was embarrassed to hear himself say out loud because it made him sound like a person who didn\u2019t know the difference between a pastry and a paycheck. He worked for a sponsor, he admitted, the maple syrup in the pretty bottle with the leaf like a vain hand, and his boss had liked the idea that last year\u2019s drama could sell this year\u2019s sweetness.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say sabotage because men like that never do; he said nudge and optics and keep everybody honest. He stumbled over the part where he was eager to make sure I didn\u2019t tell a story that didn\u2019t flatter their brand, and then, to his credit, he stopped and backed up and said, \u201cI am hearing myself and I am appalled,\u201d and that made his voice more useful to me. He didn\u2019t know about the juice. He didn\u2019t know about the note. He knew about the cap, he said finally, and he knew the name that went with the thumb, and he said it the way people say names when they\u2019ve had to learn them on paper first. It wasn\u2019t Walt, or Hank, or any of the men who sit on stools in our town and talk about weather like they invented it. It was the name of a runner in Calgary who moved equipment for shows and had worked too many productions with too little sleep and had a habit of solving problems nobody asked him to solve.\n\nAfter we hung up, I took the name out to the garage because I wanted to see how it looked next to the dent in the drywall and the stripe of oil that keeps its own calendar. I said it out loud to let it bounce off the tool bench and see if anything fell out of the air that I could use. Jill joined me with two mugs and handed me one like we were in a play about forgiveness. She asked if the name felt like anything and I said it felt like a man who thinks every woman in a room is both a department and a solution. She nodded like that was a taste she\u2019d encountered before and then put the mug down and picked up the fake trophy and set it on the shelf next to the photograph in the same movement with no ceremony at all, and the lack of ceremony made my eyes do the wet thing and then not.\n\nWe slept that night as if sleep were a job and we were trying to impress a supervisor. The house made the soft adjustments houses make when they\u2019ve decided they are on your side, and I woke once with the old startle and then remembered that I had told my brain it could be scared without inviting fear to put its boots on the bedspread. In the morning, I went for a walk in Waskasoo with my hands in my pockets and my eyes on the part of the path where dogs write their stories for each other, and I let the cold rearrange the parts of me that like drama and ask them to sit quietly. A man with a navy cap ran past me going the other direction and didn\u2019t look at me at all, and the tiny theater in my chest that had been rehearsing the scene where I met the villain without my eyeliner called a halt and sent everyone home because they needed rest.\n\nBack at the house, the mail had been pushed through the slot with an enthusiasm that made me worry about our postal worker\u2019s hands. Among the flyers and the glossy lies about furniture there was a heavy envelope with my pen name written in a hand I recognized only because I had seen it on the label of a jar of pickles at the farmer\u2019s market. Inside was a letter that did not attempt poetry. It was from the woman who sells chokecherry jam in a stall near the entrance, the one who wears the same apron my grandmother had but jollier. She said she had watched the show and yelled at the television and then apologized to her husband and then yelled again, and she wanted me to know that if I needed chokecherries she had two freezer bags labelled by month and moon phase. She said her sister had once forgotten a whole season and had remembered it again because someone baked a pie that tasted exactly like the day the power went out and everyone in the street had come outside and learned each other\u2019s names. She said, \u201cYou do not owe anybody an explanation for why you had to do the same brave thing twice.\u201d\n\nJill brought in the paper and rolled her eyes at the editorial about how television had made people forget how to be decent at four-way stops. She made a list on the back for me because lists calm her and because today\u2019s tasks were not imaginary for once. Call the sponsor whose maples were ashamed. Call the wardrobe assistant back and ask what she\u2019s doing next, because good people need jobs they didn\u2019t plan, and this was what we could do about that. Meet our father at the caf\u00e9 because he had texted, three words that would have made me laugh if they hadn\u2019t made my stomach behave like something under the stove. He had sent, behave yourself please, and then had the sense to follow it with, that\u2019s for me, not you.\n\nWe went because the thing about being from a place is that you show up when the person who made you complicated asks you politely not to make them worse. The caf\u00e9 was warmer than it needed to be and Green Hair slid us our drinks without payment and then turned her back in a practiced way that tells you she knows when not to collect the story. Our father was already at a table with his cap rolled in his hands and his jacket hung on the back of the chair like a man he was trying to keep from leaving. He looked better than he had the night before and worse, which is to say he had slept just the amount you sleep when your brain is arguing with your pride. He stood because his mother raised him with a long wooden spoon and he has the marks to prove it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t waste words on compliments or on how television makes people look different. He had a printout in his hand, which was new and frightening because printers intimidate him, and he slid it across to Jill with careful fingers. It was a page from a staffing agency\u2019s website with faces that you\u2019d forget unless you had a reason not to, and one of them had a thumb visible because of the way he held a wrench in a posed way that looked natural if you\u2019d never seen how real hands behave around tools. The scar was there, a pale line that said the man had been careless with something sharp once and had learned only enough to get by. The name under the picture was the one from the sponsor\u2019s call, which made me grateful for the small evil of corporate efficiency.\n\n\u201cI went to the yard at sunup and asked the boys if they knew him,\u201d my father said, and his voice had the satisfaction of a person who has allowed the morning air into parts he usually keeps closed. \u201cTwo did. One of them owed him fifty bucks and the other had a cousin who said he\u2019ll do anything twice if the first time pays. He works under a foreman who doesn\u2019t know how to say no and above a kid who needs to. He likes to be where the noise is.\u201d He glanced at me then, and I felt the part of him that could have tried to use this as a ribbon, a way to tie us into a story where he was the hero, take the leash off and let it run around the block once before it came back and sat. \u201cYou give this to your haircuts,\u201d he said, using Jill\u2019s term like a man who knows when to steal. \u201cYou tell them I\u2019m not messy like I used to be. You tell them to keep their hands clean while they shake the tree.\u201d\n\nWe called the officers, and the older one\u2019s pleased hum came through the line in a way that told me he had been hoping his day would have shape and now it did. He asked us to email the link and the screenshot and the notes from the sponsor and the log of calls, and Jill did it while giving the computer the side-eye the way you give a neighbor\u2019s dog permission to lick you because it insists. I texted the wardrobe assistant to tell her about the name and the thumb and to ask if she wanted to meet us for a coffee where no one was filming, and she replied with a heart and a knife, which is our new family crest, and said maybe later, because today she was packing a box in a room that had too many mirrors.\n\nIn the afternoon, when the light turned that color that makes me think of the first cups of tea poured by women who have survived babies and men and their own bodies, I set dough to rise because the house needed to see my hands make something that wasn\u2019t defense. I made bread that doesn\u2019t like to be rushed and I didn\u2019t rush it; I wrapped the bowl with the towel my aunt embroidered and told it I trusted it to do what it had promised. Jill answered three calls from women she had sat on curbs with in bare feet at three in the morning while gasoline thought about being a fire, and she used the voice that tells people they\u2019ve already done the brave part and all that\u2019s left is the paperwork. Our father texted again, three words that were worse than the last three because they were better. He said, proud of you, without a period, and I sat down hard on the floor and let the bread rise above me like a cloud.\n\nTowards evening, a car I didn\u2019t recognize pulled up and stopped the way careful drivers do when they arrive in a neighborhood where they have not earned the right to drive badly. A woman with a coat that belonged to a different city got out and stood on the sidewalk looking at our house as if she were trying to decide what kind of door her knock would be. I stepped onto the porch and waited because I\u2019ve learned to let other people define the scene when they bring their own weather to my steps. She had hair that said she went to bed with it wet and hoped for the best and a scar along her jaw like someone had once explained to her that winter is unfair and she had agreed. She introduced herself as the legal person for the sponsor with the leaf, but her voice didn\u2019t sound legal; it sounded like someone who has had to learn the trick of making her mouth say money when her brain is writing brief histories of all the rooms she\u2019s in.\n\nShe apologized in a way that included the building she works in without making it a shield, and she said she had brought a letter that said they were withdrawing from any activities that look like nudging people without their consent. She said she had a aunt in Waskasoo and this street used to be her route on a bicycle that was too big for her and she had the scars on her shins to prove it. She asked if I wanted her to take back the pretty bottle with the vein of syrup that had been in the hamper, and I told her it could stay because I am trying to learn the difference between the object and the person it reminds me of. Before she left, she said the name of the man with the thumb without being asked, and I believed her more than I believed anyone attached to a budget in weeks, which is not the same thing as trust and will have to do.\n\nWe ate bread with soup and there was butter involved and the house pretended not to notice how grateful I was to be allowed this. Jill wiped the table with the concentration she saves for when she is waiting for a text that will tell her a person she loves has survived something and can be told a joke. The text arrived, not from a person we know, but from the production number we have saved as the word tent, and it said that he had been let go from his freelance contract pending an investigation, and that they were very sorry to have introduced a man with a hero complex to a room where sugar worked just fine without him. I didn\u2019t want to feel glee because I have been on the losing end of other people\u2019s justice before, but I let myself enjoy the way the sentence had been written without consulting a lawyer first.\n\nNight made its case again and I agreed to it. Before I went to bed, I stood in the garage and touched the dent in the drywall because it is rude to visit a place that has held a memory and not acknowledge its work. I looked at the photograph and the plastic trophy making a temporary peace on the shelf and the ridiculous sprig of lavender that had refused to die on its way here, and I said the word remember in the casual way you would ask someone to pass you the salt. In bed, I wrote a paragraph in the green notebook I knew would make the bird publisher call again and I did it anyway. I wrote that the thing about heat is that it makes everything honest, and that sugar is only a liar if you expect it to behave like salt, and that people who think confetti is decoration have never had it in their mouths when they were trying to say thank you. Then I turned off the light and slept because I could, and because I have learned that practicing joy is the only rehearsal that matters when the curtain goes up again and you are asked, once more, to carry something that could shatter and decide not to.",

I was at my usual table near the window of the caf\u00e9 on Ross Street, wearing the sweater with the missing elbow patch and pretending to edit chapter twelve of a novel I hadn\u2019t confessed to anyone I was writing. The steam from my Americano kept fogging my glasses and clearing again, like breath on glass. Like someone was trying to say something and I kept missing it.\n\nA ping, then another. I almost ignored it. The last three pings had been reminders from my landlord that the snow needed clearing in the alley behind the house. When the subject line resolved, my hands went cold, and then hot as if I\u2019d knocked over the cup in my head.\n\nFinalist confirmation.\n\nI clicked.\n\n\u201cDear Ms. Lumen,\u201d the message read. The producers never got used to my pen name, and neither had I, despite the fact that it was printed on the covers of two books and stapled to the front of the manuscript glowering at me from my bag. \u201cWe are delighted to confirm your place in the Maple Hearth final this Saturday at the Stampede Park Pavilion in Calgary. Call time is 6:00 AM. Please bring at least two aprons and any specialty equipment. Congratulations, and break an egg!\u201d\n\nI read it twice, then once more out loud, which prompted a glance from the barista, who had bright green hair and a nose piercing that sparkled like a tiny snowflake.\n\n\u201cGood news?\u201d she asked, wiping a clean mug that didn\u2019t need wiping.\n\nI held up my phone, the email bright and impossible. \u201cFinal. I\u2019m in the final.\u201d\n\nShe tilted her head, trying to remember what I\u2019d told her on a different day when I was a different person. She snapped her fingers. \u201cMaple Hearth? The baking show? Oh, that\u2019s huge. You\u2019re going to be famous-famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.\u201d I laughed, the sound coming out wrong, like a scratched record. It felt like the part of my life that had always been quiet and interior\u2014words spread out across pages, the secret fellowship of butter and sugar in the bowl\u2014was suddenly going to be witnessed. Burnished under bright lights. Measured. Judged.\n\nI texted my sister.\n\nIt was our shorthand. Jill was a paramedic; everything in our family was triage, crisis, and how we reset when the sirens were turned off.\n\nShe replied instantly, as if she\u2019d been waiting. I had the sense sometimes that Jill stood ready for me just to tip, with a stretcher and a blanket and tea in a thermos.\n\nI felt the table shake and realized it was my knees. Something inside me had always believed I was an almost, someone who came mildly close to good things and collected them in a box to take out later, when the room was empty.\n\n\u201cCareful,\u201d the barista said. \u201cWe can put some tape under one of the legs. Or, you know, you could just breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d I said, and then inhaled, slow, counting to four, to six, to eight like the therapist with the cinnamon tea had taught me. The panic receded, a tide that hadn\u2019t decided on its own mind. \u201cI should buy a second apron.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should buy five,\u201d she said. \u201cOne for each camera. One to throw at the judge if he tells you your crust is soggy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoggy is the worst,\u201d I agreed. The email felt heavy in my palm, and light, and then heavy again.\n\nOn my way home through Waskasoo Park, the snow bled quietly into the river and the geese watched me like judges who\u2019d seen everyone\u2019s practice bakes. My house was a small blue square with a porch that sloped as if it was listening. Inside, the air was a familiar mix of yeast, paper, and the lavender oil I dabbed under my wrists when I couldn\u2019t sleep. My kitchen looked like it had tried and failed to become a cookbook photo: bowls stacked on the butcher block, a jar of sourdough starter that sometimes behaved and sometimes sulked, a wooden spoon with a bite taken out of it by an old dog I didn\u2019t own anymore.\n\nI called Jill. She picked up in the middle of a siren. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, shouting over something that sounded important. \u201cI saw the text. I\u2019ll call you back in twenty.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d I started and stopped. The silence between us was never empty. It was full of the things we chose not to say when we couldn\u2019t see each other\u2019s faces. \u201cDo you think Dad would\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty,\u201d she said again, then, softer: \u201cBreathe.\u201d\n\nI set the phone down and did what I always do when news\u2014good or bad\u2014arrives. I took out a recipe that didn\u2019t need me to be anyone except someone who could follow instructions. I sifted flour and pretended not to notice the parts of me that like to go missing. I cut butter into flour and pretended not to notice the ache in my head that had lived there since last spring, like a tenant who\u2019d lost the lease and refused to leave.\n\nThe neurologist had a name for it that sounded like rain against the window. Transient global amnesia. It made my mouth dry, the way Latin words sometimes do when they name a thing you thought was yours alone. I\u2019d lost days. Whole weeks were a soft blur that smelled like hospital antiseptic and someone else's perfume. I\u2019d woken up in May with a ribbon tied around my wrist and a scar on my forehead and Jill making scrambled eggs at my stove as if we were kids again. \u201cYou should stop bumping into things,\u201d she\u2019d said, trying to sound breezy and failing.\n\n\u201cWhat things?\u201d I had asked, and she had smiled with her teeth and not her eyes. \u201cLife,\u201d she said, like a joke.\n\nI made pie dough because it\u2019s what my hands knew. I worked fast, slicing the butter into little moons, their edges softening under my warm fingers. I grated a stick, because grating butter makes it listen better. I told the dough to stay flaky, and it mostly did. While it rested in the fridge like a pet that needs its cage covered to sleep, I rolled my shoulders and tried to recall every step that had taken me to that email.\n\nAuditions. Signature bakes. The technical where I\u2019d misread the judge\u2019s handwriting and added salt twice. I\u2019d laughed, and the judge with the silver hair had lifted one eyebrow, the slash that had launched a thousand GIFs, and said, \u201cBold.\u201d\n\nThe other contestants had been good. Better than good. There was a woman from Moose Jaw who made eclairs shaped like the Qu\u2019Appelle River and glazed them with Saskatoon berry jam until they gleamed. There was a man from Nanaimo who knew seven different ways to make a Nanaimo bar and looked offended if anyone suggested eight. There was a quiet, careful boy who piped meringue as if it were a blessing and not a sugar froth. And then there was me, a writer who liked the lyric structure of recipes. Someone who didn\u2019t mind that rules could hold beauty.\n\nI\u2019d committed to the show like I commit to most things: with unnecessary intensity and a small voice in my head saying, You\u2019re pretending, you\u2019re playing a part. That voice had fallen quieter each time I slid something onto the gingham-checked table and handed it to the cameras and nobody laughed.\n\nI rolled the dough out and made cut-outs in the shape of maple leaves, because maple leaves look smug and I wanted some of that smugness. I filled the pie with apples I\u2019d peeled and macerated in brown sugar and lemon juice, the sauce thick and glossy and nearly obscene. \u201cTaste,\u201d I told myself, and touched a finger to the syrup, pressing it against the roof of my mouth like a hiding place.\n\nYou\u2019re in the final. Those words would not stop being a joke. They would not stop splitting into their halves and rearranging themselves. You\u2019re in. The final. Final in. In the final. The email sitting heavy on my counter like a guest who couldn\u2019t take a hint.\n\nI folded the edges of the dough and let them overlap, like sweaters. This is how my grandmother showed me. She\u2019d grown up not far from here, on a farm where the winter lasted nine months and the other three were a rumor. She had never written a book but she\u2019d known how to make a whole room quiet by putting a pie on the table. She used to say, \u201cFood is the story you tell that people will eat.\u201d\n\nI was telling my stories with words that day because it\u2019s what I knew. When the timer went off and the kitchen was thick with sugar scent, I shut the oven and turned my face into the heat. It fogged my lashes and I closed my eyes, and when I did something bright and stumbled flickered through my head like the end of a reel. Glitter? Confetti? No, that\u2019s ridiculous; I don\u2019t go to parties. My scalp prickled. The part of my head that sometimes reached for missing months did an odd pause, like someone slipping on ice but catching themselves on a fence post.\n\nI wrote the words: maple-apple, Earl Grey custard, dacquoise, lemon curd. I wrote them in my small green notebook in the voice I used when I wasn\u2019t writing for anyone else. Then, in a corner of the page, I wrote, Do not oversteep. Be kind to the eggs. Remember to breathe.\n\nJill called me back as I was dusting powdered sugar across the maple leaves. \u201cTell me you\u2019ll let me come with you,\u201d she said, in the voice she saved for asking to be told yes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only Calgary,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get bored if you don\u2019t let me come. I\u2019ve got forty-eight hours off, and I\u2019m not spending them in front of the TV watching you and shouting corrections at the screen.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrections like what?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, don\u2019t forget the sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never forget the sugar,\u201d I said, and then laughed because it wasn\u2019t true. I forget all kinds of things. \u201cI have to be there at six.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can drive us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave the city at four-thirty. I\u2019ll set three alarms. Also, I\u2019m very good at reminding people to breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI noticed,\u201d I said. \u201cYes. Come.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, then the sound of her chewing what I knew was gum because she didn\u2019t smoke and needed something to put between herself and the world. \u201cAnd how\u2019s your head?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d I lied. Or didn\u2019t. The pain was a gentle weight today, nothing like the strange electric storms of last summer. I could live like this, I thought. I had, after all. \u201cI slept. I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dreamed,\u201d I said. \u201cSomething with\u2026 gold paper? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have real gold paper on Saturday,\u201d Jill said. \u201cConfetti. They blast it from cannons. I saw it on TV last year. It gets in everybody\u2019s hair. Even the judge looked like a New Year\u2019s decoration.\u201d\n\nI pressed the phone tighter to my ear. \u201cLast year?\u201d I asked, too quickly. \u201cYou watched last year?\u201d\n\n\u201cI watch every year. You were the one who refused to watch with me because the judge\u2019s voice gave you hives.\u201d A pause. \u201cAnyway. The final\u2019s always ridiculous. The challenges are over the top. No one\u2019s skin doesn\u2019t break. Every crust tears. They cry and then they win and then they cry harder.\u201d\n\nA door in the back of my head creaked and I pushed it shut. \u201cMaple Hearth is gentle,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re nice to people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re nice,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut the oven is not. Heat is heat.\u201d Her voice softened again. \u201cHey, be careful. Don\u2019t accept food from strangers. That show is cut-throat. I read something online about sabotages.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the American ones,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is Canada.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are people, with or without maple syrup,\u201d she said. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll keep an eye on your cup.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise,\u201d I said, even while thinking that Jill had started to sound like our mother, and that disconcerted me. Our mother who taught me to write and Jill to run and both of us to keep our tempers to ourselves. Our mother whose absence was a shape in our house we navigated around, like the ottoman you always forget is in the middle of the room until you stub your shin on it in the dark.\n\nBy Friday night the hotel in Calgary was as glossy and impersonal as a pastry glaze. There was a chandelier in the lobby that looked like a constellation had fallen down and decided to roost. People in suits and polished boots moved through the light and swallowed their reflections whole. I felt ungainly with my tote bags and my flour-dusted coat and my green notebook peeking out as if it wanted to see what a five-star sink looked like.\n\nThe woman at the front desk had a mouth like a slash of lipstick and hair like a crow\u2019s wing. \u201cWelcome,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo doubles, right? Lumen.\u201d She looked at me as if I were someone. She looked again, like the light had briefly misled her. \u201cAre you in town for\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWork,\u201d I said. I was always briefer when people asked me to define my life. Work. Writing. A thing with eggs.\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d She handed me an envelope with my name typed neatly on it. \u201cYou have a note,\u201d she said, and then leaned closer in a way she probably practiced in the mirror. \u201cGood luck tomorrow. The right people will be watching.\u201d\n\nI took the envelope to the corner by the fake fireplace and opened it. The paper had weight. The handwriting fooled me at first, too careful to be familiar. It said, simply: Remember.\n\n\u201cCreepy,\u201d Jill said, peering over my shoulder. \u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea.\u201d I looked for a signature, an initial, a flourish. Nothing. I wanted it to be from me, from another version of me who had the grace to think ahead. I wanted to have mailed myself a talisman, knowing I\u2019d need it. Memory was not a sure thing. It was a lake with thin ice in places I couldn\u2019t map.\n\n\u201cFree breakfast,\u201d Jill said, reading the pamphlet on the table. \u201cFrom six to nine. Fruit, cereal, pastries, eggs. You should have eggs. Slow proteins, so you don\u2019t crash.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never crash,\u201d I said, rolling my neck. \u201cI idle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you,\u201d she said, and kissed the top of my head. \u201cWe\u2019re setting three alarms. And we\u2019re going to practice that stunner you\u2019re making tomorrow. What is it again? Rhubarb and chokecherry mousse inside a praline cage? That thing that makes the judge cry?\u201d\n\n\u201cDacquoise,\u201d I said. \u201cMaple walnut dacquoise with chokecherry reduction and rhubarb mousse. And a cage, yes. If my hands behave. I did it once last week and it held. It was beautiful. It should have had a parade.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will get one,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the shape of applause.\u201d\n\nWe went upstairs. The elevators were mirrored, which meant I had to look at my face next to Jill\u2019s and admit we were sisters. She wore competence like jewelry. I wore it like a coat I\u2019d borrowed from someone taller. In the room, I lined up my things on the desk like talismans. Apron, apron. Piping tips, offset spatula, a whisk that had seen some things. Notebook, pen. Lavender oil, the small bottle, in case the dream with the gold paper came back and chased me down the hall.\n\nAt two in the morning I woke with my fingers aching. The ache has the shape of a memory sometimes, like the body remembering what the mind declines. I cradled my hands under the faucet and ran warm water over them and thought of the way sugar threads crystallize into lattices you can\u2019t see with the naked eye. I turned back the covers and lay awake while the city murmured. Somewhere in the hotel a door shut and then opened again. Somewhere a laugh bubbled up and then clamped down, embarrassed to exist. I put the note from the desk drawer under my pillow. Remember.\n\nAt five I was up, hair braided, the world creaking awake in blue-gray. Jill made coffee with the machine that burped and sighed like an old cat. We went down to the breakfast room, which smelled like toast and ambition. Other people in track suits and suits and tourism hoodies ate with the urgency of people who might not get a chance later. At one end a man in a chef\u2019s jacket introduced his pancake to a pool of syrup so wide I had to look away.\n\n\u201cEggs,\u201d Jill said, pointing at the chafing dish like a general. \u201cToast. Fruit. No pastries. No trying something new. Your stomach hates new.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy stomach is adventurous,\u201d I said, and picked up a piece of melon that tasted exactly like damp.\n\nI found a table near the window and put my plate down and then, because my hands needed to be doing something, I went to get a second cup of coffee. When I came back, the orange juice I hadn\u2019t poured was waiting for me, a twin to the ones at every other table, thin skin of foam, tiny beads of condensation like pearls. The print on the glass said, in cheery script: Good Morning, Calgary!\n\nJill returned from the food with a look like she\u2019d just had to extinguish a small fire. \u201cI told the guy with the ladle to put the ladle back in. You can\u2019t leave it on the counter like that. It\u2019s chaos.\u201d She sat. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\u201cJuice,\u201d I said, pointing. \u201cThey delivered juice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t doing sugar before noon,\u201d she said, but her voice was teasing, not stern. I shrugged and lifted the glass and drank, because I was thirsty and also because the juice looked very much like the kind of good thing that might want to be wasted if it wasn\u2019t consumed quickly.\n\nIt was cold and sweet and a little bit bitter. It tasted like childhood and the first day back at school. It tasted like being out of time and out of place. It tasted, one second later, wrong.\n\nMy mouth prickled. Some wrongness crawled over my tongue and down my throat with polite shoes. I put the glass down and the clink sounded further away than it should have. The walls of the room leaned. The carpet, which was patterned with cheerful hexagons, did a small tilt, then another, a sequence of moves like a magician. My heart beat very hard and then, for a moment, not at all.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Jill said. \u201cHey.\u201d She was up and around the table and holding my arm and then my face but her hands were two seconds behind the clock. \u201cYou\u2019re pale. Paler.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. My voice was smaller than it needed to be. A light cracked open behind my eyes and poured into my skull, too fast. The room did a shimmer as if it had caught fire and then remembered it was made of drywall and sighs.\n\n\u201cI need you to breathe,\u201d Jill said, this time the way she says it to people who are very seriously not breathing. \u201cSomeone\u2014can someone\u2014\u201d Her voice went louder, echoing in the polite hotel air. \u201cCall down to the desk. Now. Please.\u201d She pressed her fingers to my wrist. \u201cWhat did you eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cMelon,\u201d I said, but the word felt like three syllables and none of them agreed. \u201cJuice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, lying because she knew I didn\u2019t need the truth. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\nThe light behind my eyes flared, a match lit in a closet, and then I saw something else, as clear as if I\u2019d stepped into the scene. I was under white canvas, not hotel plaster. The air smelled like sugar burnt just to the edge and then coaxed back. People were cheering and then not cheering and it was because they couldn\u2019t hear. The judges were in front of me. The silver-haired one\u2014him of the eyebrow\u2014was smiling at a slant that meant he wasn\u2019t just being TV-kind. The other judge, the one who wore jackets like exclamation points, was clapping and her rings sent light everywhere, everywhere. There was a noise like a bell in a church and then more light from above, like snow that wasn\u2019t cold, falling. Gold paper detritus caught in my eyelashes. A feeling like the world opened and I was right at the mouth of it. Someone said my name or the name I was using then and it didn\u2019t sound wrong, it sounded exactly like me. I could feel the weight of the award in my hands. I could feel how my muscles had gone slack with relief, with love for the thing I could do when the world left me alone with ingredients and time. Confetti. That\u2019s what it was. That\u2019s what had been haunting me in my kitchen, that blur of light. Confetti. A confetti storm.\n\nIt was me. It was me, and the time was not now but before. It was last year. It was last year, and I had already been here. I had already stood in that tent and made a thing so fragile it caught its own breath. I had won.\n\nI gasped and that gasped turned into a cough and then back into a gasp, and then the present returned like a greedy tide, dragging back chairs and the sound of Jill\u2019s voice and someone else shaking the manager by the lapels. I was on the floor because the chair had not been enough. The carpet was awful against my cheek. Jill\u2019s knees were next to my head and her hand was a stripe across my chest. I threw up nothing because there was nothing in me; everything in me had risen into that one bright recall and then collapsed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Jill said, but she also moved me, which is what you do when someone is in danger of breathing their tongue. \u201cLook at me. Eyes.\u201d She snapped her fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re okay. I know you\u2019re not, but you\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\nMy voice came from far away. My voice always goes on trips when I need it. \u201cJill,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2014\u201d I swallowed. The juice had left a film I didn\u2019t want inside me. \u201cI won.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Her hair had come loose; she looked like the kind of angel no one mentions because the sight makes you weep.\n\n\u201cI was there,\u201d I said, trying to catch the words as they slid around. \u201cI won. Last year. The final. With the confetti. The\u2026 you know. They said my\u2014 they said me.\u201d The memory hovered and then sharpened. \u201cI won,\u201d I whispered, and the whisper turned into a sound like a laugh, then a cry. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t\u2014 I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d she said, and for once I had surprised her, and it made me want to keep talking just to see her face change more.\n\n\u201cI won,\u201d I said again, because the only way to make a thing true is to say it out loud where someone can catch it. \u201cAnd then\u2014\u201d I touched my forehead and felt, through my skin, the little ridge under my hair, the scar where the skin had knitted imperfectly. I put two fingers there and the hotel ceiling did a slow twirl.\n\nThe manager was there now, and someone in a white shirt too tight over their careful chest. A first aid kit materialized. A cup of water with a straw I couldn\u2019t hold. The orange juice glass on the table, my fingerprints a smudge on the side, the rest of the liquid leering at me like a carnival mirror. My tongue tried to form the words spit and poison and no, but my body was more interested in getting my heart back on tempo, in not allowing the floor to swallow me.\n\n\u201cParamedics,\u201d Jill said. \u201cI\u2019m one.\u201d She showed them something from her pocket, a card that made people step back and remember, for a second, that they loved their mothers. \u201cShe needs to be checked. Now.\u201d\n\nI had arrived at the moment where everyone moved quickly and I yielded. I thought, briefly, about my aprons upstairs, folded like letters to a future I assumed would be waiting. I thought about the note in the desk and then under the pillow, the word that gave an order I had failed to follow.\n\nRemember.\n\nMy head was full of fog and golden paper. The fog embarrassed me. The paper made me giddy. I let them pick me up. I let them shine a light in my eyes and say something about pupils and response. I let Jill squeeze my fingers and check for tremors. And then, because it was important, because it was the only thing I could take from the blur and hold like a little animal, I told her again. \u201cI won last year,\u201d I said. \u201cI forgot. I forgot and then I won.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jill said, and her voice changed. It dropped the pitch it uses for strangers and started speaking to me like I was her sister and also the person she doesn\u2019t trust with scissors. \u201cTell me later. I need you now.\u201d\n\nThere was a shape in the doorway of the breakfast room, a person I couldn\u2019t place with a coat too appropriate for the weather. They glanced, then left, the way guilty people do even when they\u2019ve done nothing. I tried to remember their face, to pull their eyes forward. It didn\u2019t stick. I tried to remember the confetti again instead, and the tent smell, and the weight in my hands. It stuck too well, like sugar in a pot you forget to watch.\n\nOne of the paramedics asked my name and I gave them the one from my ID and then, unhelpfully, my pen name. \u201cShe does that,\u201d Jill told them. \u201cShe\u2019s both. She\u2019s fine, except for not being fine.\u201d She brushed hair from my face. \u201cHoney, who gave you that juice?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d I said, because in my head Jill hands me everything. It was safer to pretend that no one else could touch my mouth.\n\nTap-tap. The manager again. \u201cOur staff wouldn\u2019t\u2014 I mean, we train\u2014 We have cameras. If someone\u2014 we can\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCameras,\u201d Jill said, and the word was as crisp as ice cracking. \u201cThen go look.\u201d\n\nSomeone lifted. Someone steadied. The elevator had never been so slow. The bed upstairs took me and I sank as if it had been waiting for my shape. On the way, in the place between upright and lying down where words sometimes shake loose, I said to Jill, \u201cI needed to make the cage. That\u2019s the hard part. The praline, you have to go to soft crack and then pull it, you have to coax it. Like a stubborn cat. The heat wants to own you. But if you talk to it, it listens.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she said, and kissed my knuckles. \u201cTell the judge that. He loves metaphors.\u201d\n\nThe room smelled faintly like lavender because I had touched the oil without thinking. Light skirted around the edges of the blackout curtains. The city did its small daytime noise. My head did not so much hurt now as float, without regard to gravity or common sense. Somewhere in the building a door shut louder than it needed to. Somewhere in me a door opened and swung, open-open, the kind of open I had feared every time I remembered not remembering.\n\nI lay and counted backwards from one hundred and got to ninety-three before falling asleep hard and graceless, the way a drunken body surrenders. The last thought I had was not a thought; it was the sensation of sugar between my fingers and gold paper in my hair, gratitude falling. And in that space just before dark I understood that there had been a reason I wouldn\u2019t watch last year\u2019s final with Jill. Not hives. Fear. And the knowledge that something in me had already cupped that kind of joy and then spilled it, carelessly, while crossing an empty street in daylight.\n\nWhen I woke, Jill\u2019s mouth was a line and she was on the phone with someone she did not like. Her voice made the air sharpen. \u201cThen explain to me,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy the only waitress within ten feet of the juice table was the same one who served the production team yesterday. Explain to me why there was a man in a navy cap standing behind my sister\u2019s chair for longer than the people behind everyone else\u2019s chairs.\u201d\n\nShe listened. The listening made her jaw clench the way it does when she thinks I can\u2019t see. She covered the phone and looked at me and her eyes were glassy and then not. \u201cDo you remember anything else?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, because I wanted to be useful. \u201cI remember the way the judge\u2019s voice sounded last year when he said my name. Like he was surprised. Like he had planned to say someone else\u2019s and then didn\u2019t. I remember the weight of the\u2014 of the trophy. It\u2019s heavy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remember that,\u201d she said slowly, like we were both trying to step onto a step we weren\u2019t sure existed. \u201cDo you remember not opening a box in June? Do you remember leaving a box in the garage for three months because you said you didn\u2019t know who it belonged to?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, because I didn\u2019t. My head did the small in-and-out motion it does when trying to find a hallway. \u201cDid I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d she said. \u201cYou told me you felt like you were stealing from someone. And then, when I got mad, you cried and then laughed and then went outside and came back with rhubarb and made a galette that made me forgive you.\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and the picture came, a slant of light across the garage floor, a cardboard box with tape that didn\u2019t match my tape. I remembered lifting it and feeling my wrists complain. I remembered there being something inside with metal corners and my relief when I put it down. There had been a dusting of gold in the air, small, everywhere, as if I\u2019d brought it in on the hem of my jeans.\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d I squeezed my eyes tighter. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d she said, snapping in exactly the way that meant she was trying not to cry. \u201cApologize for nothing. We\u2019re going to figure out who spiked your breakfast. We\u2019re going to figure out why you didn\u2019t get told last year\u2019s story the way you deserved to. And we\u2019re going to go to the Pavilion and you\u2019re going to do what you came to do, unless you can\u2019t stand up, in which case I will tie you to the counter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat seems dramatic,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling dramatic,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you sit up slowly and drink water like a human? Don\u2019t tilt your head. Nice and slow. That\u2019s it. Good. Gorgeous. You\u2019re a hydration model.\u201d\n\nThe water was room-temperature and tasted like victory. Or maybe I was confusing my senses. The memory of confetti felt like dehydration and a cure. The remaining badness in my body felt like a foolishness I wanted to shrug off like a wet coat. I put my hand on my ribs and felt how my lungs reached for the air and found it. I thought of the show tent, its white armor, the way it felt to stand in a place designed to be a stage and not a home, and I thought of my small kitchen and its burnt edges and its miraculous soft light. I belonged nowhere exactly. I could make something edible anywhere someone let me have mixing bowls and flour.\n\n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll let me compete?\u201d I asked, and heard how I was trying, again, to be brave.\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll let them stop you?\u201d she said. \u201cListen.\u201d She put her phone down and took my hand, variety of the caliber of sincerity she rarely uses because it means we are admitting to the existence of futures without guarantees. \u201cTell me again. The confetti.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was everywhere,\u201d I said. \u201cIt got in my mouth. It tasted like paper. I tried to spit it out and the camera caught me trying to be polite and failing. The judge said, \u2018You gave us a cathedral in pastry,\u2019 and I laughed because that\u2019s quite the line, right? And then I was crying because he was right, and I had. And everywhere gold paper kept falling. I carried some of it home in my pockets, I think.\u201d I touched my hair. \u201cThere might still be some in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cLet them try to wash it out. Let them try to make you ordinary.\u201d\n\nThe hotel hummed. My phone was a dead weight on the nightstand. The note peeked out from under the pillow and did not glow, but it could have. Remember. Either a warning or an instruction. Either way, a direction.\n\nWe sat in that quiet and loud room and watched the time do what time does in hospitals and hotel rooms and backstage dressing rooms: it ran angrily in place, then took off without telling anyone. When the knock came at the door, I knew two things: that I had a second to decide how to stand up, and that someone on the other side wanted to tell me something that would both clarify and murk the water.\n\nIt was the producer, of course. He had hair that looked like it had been airbrushed onto his head and a smile like a trademark. He looked at me the way people look at people who have been tricked and then discovered there was a gift behind the trick.\n\n\u201cWe have a situation,\u201d he said, and then the rest of the morning said it with him.",

                              "content": "He stood in the doorway like a punctuation mark someone had dropped in the wrong place, and Jill slid between us the way water finds its level. His smile was the kind that starts as a reflex and then has to be manually adjusted into sincerity. He used my pen name twice in the first sentence, as if invoking it could keep the room neat. He said words like we and safety and optics, and I watched his hands while he talked because hands tell you who someone is when their mouth is paid not to.\n\n\u201cWe have medics on site,\u201d he said, and looked at Jill, recalibrating. \u201cYou know protocol. We need her to be seen. After that, she can compete if she signs a waiver acknowledging\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jill said, before he could make the word sound better than it is. \u201cNo waivers. A signature is not a vitamin. She\u2019s seeing your medic, and then we\u2019ll decide.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me again as if I might be easier to move. I made my face polite, which is how I say no without having to make a scene. The room had the wrong number of corners. The note under my pillow warmed my scalp like a little heating pad for courage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also something else,\u201d he said, and ran a hand over his hair as if to confirm it was still theoretical. \u201cOur compliance team flagged a\u2026 possible duplication. We didn\u2019t connect it at auditions because of the name, but someone in Calgary\u2014someone in\u2026 wardrobe\u2014recognized you this morning. We need to know if you\u2019ve\u2014if you might have been with us before. Last season.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, because the truth had woken up inside me and was stretching. The startled sound he made told me he had been hoping for coincidence. \u201cI think I was,\u201d I said, and then, because I wanted to puncture the clean balloon of his neutrality, I added, \u201cI think I won.\u201d\n\nHe blinked like flash photography. Behind him, the hallway took a breath and swallowed. \u201cWe\u2014\u201d He looked at Jill and then back at me. \u201cWe film multiple endings,\u201d he said, and his voice had a new layer, the one they use on contestants who are crying prettily and haven\u2019t signed anything yet. \u201cTo protect the integrity of the results from leaks. Confetti for everyone, essentially. You were in the final. You were\u2026 exceptional. We shot\u2026 coverage. We sent all three finalists home with the standard hamper. We\u2026 became aware of your medical situation the following week and were asked to make no further contact.\u201d\n\nJill didn\u2019t flinch like I expected. She held his gaze until his eyes did a small surrender. Later I would realize that nothing he was saying was news to her. In the now, I felt a small tear move down my scalp where the memory had stitched itself in, and it hurt, and it didn\u2019t. \u201cSo it\u2019s possible,\u201d I said, careful with words like scalpels. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the confetti is in my head because you put it there on purpose. Because you asked me to hold something heavy and told me to look like it was mine.\u201d My laugh surprised me by being gentle. \u201cI\u2019m good at pretending.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good at baking,\u201d he said quickly, like flattery could cauterize. \u201cAlso at taking direction.\u201d He blushed after, a human blush that made him briefly likable. \u201cLook. There are rules. If a competitor has previously reached the final, they are ineligible for future seasons. We should have\u2026 recognized. We didn\u2019t. That\u2019s on us. However,\u201d he said, as if producing a rabbit he wasn\u2019t sure of, \u201cthe decoy endings complicate eligibility. In our books, the finalist is the person whose win was broadcast. You were not the broadcast winner. Technically. We are prepared to allow you to compete. But we need to be careful, because if anyone\u2014if social media\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media is a basement we don\u2019t owe rent to,\u201d Jill said, and crossed her arms. \u201cShe\u2019s competing if she\u2019s safe to compete. If she isn\u2019t, she isn\u2019t. If you try to use her as an arc, I will film my own ending.\u201d\n\nHe ducked, acknowledging a blow he\u2019d earned. The performance left his face and a tired man looked out. \u201cSomeone delivered a drink to your table unasked,\u201d he said softly, as if this might be a secret we could make small by whispering. \u201cWe have the footage. It was an affiliate server in a hotel uniform who took a tray from our hospitality table. A man in a navy cap spoke to her, briefly. He could be nobody. He could be\u2026 an eager fan. He could be on our payroll. We don\u2019t know yet. Our medic would like to draw blood. We would like to file a report. We would also like to put a human next to your station who is not a competitor and not a producer. If you have a sister who is a paramedic who refuses to sign anything, that would be ideal.\u201d\n\nJill\u2019s chin lifted as if someone had just offered to pronounce her last name correctly. \u201cI\u2019ll take that lanyard,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll stand where I can see her hands and everyone else\u2019s. I\u2019ll fetch her water. I\u2019ll glare at anyone who comes within a meter without a good reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, and his relief was so unguarded that I chose to like him for another minute. \u201cAlso\u2014\u201d He hesitated, and then did the brave thing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. For last year. For any way in which we made a hard thing harder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mailed me a box,\u201d I said, thinking of the tape that hadn\u2019t matched any of mine. \u201cI left it in the garage like it belonged to a woman who might come by later and ring the bell and ask for it back.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and stared at his shoes. \u201cThere were\u2026 cookies in there. From the craft team. They write letters to finalists sometimes. Notes. I have\u2026 I have a daughter who writes to people she sees on the show. She thinks the tent is a church.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her it isn\u2019t,\u201d I said, and then softened because the tent is a holy place to me even when I don\u2019t call it that. \u201cTell her sometimes people pray in there anyway.\u201d\n\nWhen the medic came, he was younger than my hunger and very serious. He asked me to touch my nose and press my tongue against my teeth and fix my eyes on his finger. If he had asked me to recite recipes in reverse chronological order I could have. He took blood and apologized to my vein and taped me with a little square of hope. He listened to my heart and said it was trying to be good despite feeling like a drum someone else was playing. He asked what I had eaten and drunk and seemed interested in the melon in a way I hadn\u2019t expected. \u201cPesticides can make people weird,\u201d he said, and then blushed as if he\u2019d confessed to reading gossip. \u201cI mean. Not in a\u2026 criminal way. Just. Sometimes the body says, absolutely not. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, which was true in the way the sky is fine even when it\u2019s considering rain. \u201cI can stand. I can\u2026 do things with eggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep you sitting until the last minute,\u201d Jill said, and tucked my hair behind my ear with the tenderness she keeps in a special pocket. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll eat something the shape of a cracker. Plain. Air and salt. Don\u2019t argue. Save your fire for sugar.\u201d\n\nThe Pavilion was a white animal in the morning light, square and practical with a sighing belly. The cold here was an argument the air had with itself and then resolved. Equipment trucks squatted like cows in a field. A swath of winter-blue tarp did its best to pretend to be sky. Inside, the fake tent was a cathedral of PVC and hope, lights hanging like planets domesticated. The floor had been taped in lines where our paths should not cross and where cameras wanted us to pretend not to see them. The smell was a careful layering: lemon cleaner, vanilla extract, the echo of yesterday\u2019s coffee, nerves, hairspray, wool.\n\nThe contestants were penguin-ing into their places, balancing baskets of ingredients like offerings. Moose Jaw Eclair lifted a hand in greeting and then let it drop, as if friendliness might be stolen by proximity. The Nanaimo Bar Man wore a shirt that made a case for plaid as destiny. The boy with the blessing meringues was more man than boy today, jaw set, the slice in his eyebrow deeper than I remembered, as if ambition had sharpened it. There were new faces I recognized by rumor, not by sight: a woman from the North Shore who slept with her sourdough starter like a hot water bottle, a teacher from Thunder Bay who had promised the mothers in her class she would make custard look easy.\n\nWhen the judges walked in, the air showed them to their marks like an usher. The silver-haired man had removed the part of his face that belongs to memes and was wearing a mouth that might belong to a person who says thank you in grocery stores. The woman with rings had on a jacket the color of cranberry juice pretending to be wine. Her eyes softened when she saw me in a way that told me she was the kind of person who remembers names with the full bodies they belong to.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re honored,\u201d she said to all of us, and meant it. Cameras leaned toward us. The host, a man with a voice like toast, said the word Canada as if it were a person he loved.\n\n\u201cSignature,\u201d the producer had told us in the email with the underlined call time. \u201cA pair of tarts that tell us where you\u2019re from and where you\u2019re going. Two flavors, one crust. Five hours.\u201d\n\nFive hours is a sentence and a forgiveness. You can ruin and rebuild in five hours if your hands stay true. You can call your grandmother\u2019s winter over and tell spring it can come in. You can make a custard that sets like resolve if you remember not to bully the eggs. I held my apron up like it could cover fear the way it covers clothes. Jill tied me in with a professional knot that would hold a body on a stretcher and then smoothed the string twice because she can\u2019t help mothering the things she saves.\n\n\u201cWater,\u201d she said, and handed me a bottle she had opened herself. \u201cDon\u2019t leave it. If you want more, say my name. Not any other name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have only one name,\u201d I said, and she raised one eyebrow until I added, \u201cIn this room.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo your thing,\u201d she said, and stepped back to the line someone else had taped on the floor to keep her off the television and out of the story.\n\nWhen the clock started, the sound was bright and unnecessary. Metal, glass, a chorus of knives. I moved in the way my body knows when my head gets out of the way. Flour. Butter. Salt. Water so cold it argued back when I touched it. I grated butter into the bowl until my hand ached with useful pain and the pieces looked like the first snow that doesn\u2019t stick. I pinched and cut and folded until the dough came together with the possibility of flake. I told it to rest and wrapped it and sent it to cool. The mixer\u2019s hum became the sound of home.\n\nTo tell them where I\u2019m from, I steeped tea. Earl Grey, blood orange twist. Not too long. Not enough to scald the leaf into bark. I warmed cream and coaxed the heat into tempering eggs with a patience I did not have in any other part of my life. The custard thickened like a promise I wasn\u2019t ready to make, and I set it aside, skin pressed with parchment because nobody likes memory on their tongue when it isn\u2019t theirs.\n\nTo tell them where I\u2019m going, I made a curd the color of a small sun. Lemon, sure, but with sea buckthorn I\u2019d frozen last fall in a fit of prairie abundance. Tart that doesn\u2019t apologize. Sweet that knows its limits. Butter beaten in at the end like you\u2019re convincing someone to stay. Behind me someone dropped a pan and swore in French and the sound made me love the room harder.\n\nI rolled the dough too thin on purpose and then stacked it, laminating my own stubbornness. The crusts blind-baked under ceramic weights that looked like marbles smuggled out of a schoolyard. While they browned, I candied chokecherries for later, not because the brief asked for it but because I wanted the taste of last summer to glisten somewhere I could reach.\n\nJill\u2019s hand hovered into my frame with more water and I took it, drank, set it down, watched her take it away like a magician so no one else could touch it. The silver-haired judge stopped at my station long enough to say, \u201cYou look\u2026 familiar,\u201d and then tilted his head in a way that told me that wasn\u2019t his question.\n\n\u201cSo do you,\u201d I said, and placed my palms flat on the counter because sometimes bodies talk without permission. \u201cI steeped your favorite too long last time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBold,\u201d he said, a line we both remembered from a place my brain can only find if it runs. His smile had corners that weren\u2019t allowed on television.\n\nThe ringed judge came two stations later and pretended not to know my name until her hand brushed an imaginary lapel and I saw the corner of an envelope flash behind her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the sea buckthorn,\u201d she said. \u201cPrairie acid. It\u2019s a neglected fruit. Like an eccentric aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe buys the best gifts,\u201d I said. \u201cWrapped in brown paper and twine. You have to work to get to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and moved along, her rings scattering light like someone happy to pay the electric bill.\n\nOther people\u2019s kitchens make different sounds. Moose Jaw Eclair whistled through her teeth when she was brave. The Thunder Bay teacher hummed under her breath the way you do at two in the morning with a baby, a rhythm that convinces the air to help. Nanaimo Bar Man scraped something with determination and muttered about coconut like prayer.\n\nHalfway through, my head went briefly to a place that smelled like lavender and hospital sheets and then swung back like a door with a chain. The world took a step to one side and I let it. I set one hand flat on the counter and the other on my ribcage and counted to four and to six and to eight. I tasted citrus that wasn\u2019t there because memory has its own pantry. When the tilt righted, I looked at Jill and she tapped two fingers to her wrist, our shorthand for time, for pulse, for I\u2019m here.\n\nWe layered tart shells with jam, thin as forgiveness. Custard poured like silk. Curd sat up like a girl at her first grown-up table and decided to behave. I made a lattice for the top of one of them out of pecan praline because my hands needed a difficult thing to do. Sugar to hard crack, not too far. Amber like the underside of a fox. Pulling it is a negotiation, not a war. I stretched, doubled back, wove, cooled, pressed. The threads remembered being liquid. My fingers remembered being burned before and chose differently.\n\n\u201cTen minutes,\u201d the host said, and the cameras leaned so hard I could hear their gears. I sugared cranberries for a frost and set them on the curd like punctuation. I scattered the chokecherries across the custard tart and dripped the reduction in five unwise places that made it look like a map that only I could read. I wiped my plates the way a person wipes a mouth, indulgent and exact.\n\nSomeone behind me said, \u201cOh, come on,\u201d not to anyone in particular but to the God of Sugar and Heat, and my heart reached for them in sympathy and then remembered it belonged to me. The high camera sang its mechanical song. The clock did the theater thing where twelve seconds takes a lifetime and one minute is barely room to breathe. I put my hands on the edge of the bench and waited for time to turn into applause or lesson.\n\nWhen they called for us to step back, I stepped back. Jill blew out a breath like someone had been holding her under. The room did its near-silence, the kind that shakes after being loud.\n\nJudging is a ritual and a tangle. You offer your sacrament to strangers and ask them to call it by its name. The judges moved, and the moving made each of us hold still. They tasted Moose Jaw\u2019s eclairs and said river and current and your pastry is a little tough, my love. They tasted the Thunder Bay custard and said classroom and comfort and could be deeper, but what a dream. When they got to me, the silver-haired judge held my plate as if it might bite.\n\n\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d he asked, and I told him, as if I hadn\u2019t already, in apples and Earl Grey and soft flakes. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked next, and I put the sea buckthorn under his tongue. He closed his eyes. He opened them and was asked by cameras to say a sentence that could be put on gift mugs.\n\n\u201cYou have restraint I don\u2019t expect from a person who clearly likes drama,\u201d he said, and I smiled because I am the kind of girl who used to cry over soggy bottoms in other people\u2019s pies. The ringed judge touched the praline lattice with one fingernail and looked like a person who believes in the engineering feats of women in kitchens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a window,\u201d she said. \u201cA window that opens.\u201d She went quiet in the way people do when they have decided to be generous and not perform it. \u201cI could eat this forever,\u201d she added, which is not a thing anyone can do, but it was sweet.\n\nI took my breath down from where it had been watching the lights. Jill\u2019s hand flew up a joy it didn\u2019t know where to put and then settled, embarrassed, on her hip. The Nanaimo Bar Man grinned at me from his corner like we had made a pact not to die on television and were going to keep it. The boy with the meringue blesses scowled down at his own plate with love like an angry father and I felt an old affection for people who are tender and pretend not to be.\n\nBetween the signature and the technical there is always a lull designed to let the story catch up. We were herded to a table with fruit that looked brighter than reality and water that had to be opened in front of us like a magic trick with seals and seals. The host came and told a joke about winter we laughed at because he needed us to. My hands shook the tiny shake of spent adrenaline and new. Jill leaned on the fake fence behind me and watched the room like a training exercise.\n\nThe producer stopped two yards away as if proximity could hurt us both. He lifted his chin a fraction at Jill, and she lowered her lanyard in reply as if to say, I earned this. He stepped closer and his breath carried coffee and apology. \u201cThe lab called,\u201d he said, quiet enough that only my fear could hear. \u201cIf there was anything in the juice responsible, it\u2019s gone or too small. Sugar, citrus, a little pith. No unusual agents. Keep hydrating. The hotel is reviewing. The police would like to ask you questions after today,\u201d he added, like a footnote. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cAlso. Wardrobe. The note you found. That wasn\u2019t from us.\u201d\n\nMy blood did a small turn in the cul-de-sac behind my heart. \u201cWho?\u201d I asked, and he shook his head in a way that meant speculation but not certainty. \u201cWe found a man in a navy cap on the tape,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t see his face. He speaks to the waitress, points, then leaves when you fall. He doesn\u2019t look back.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jill muttered. \u201cPeople madly in love with their own invisibility never do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d he said, and for a moment I was sorry for him again in the way I get sorry for bees trapped against glass. He slid away before he got stuck to us.\n\nThe technical was posted on the big board with numbers instead of names because humiliation is best administered anonymously. Pithiviers. Maple-pumpkin, twenty-six layers, leaf pattern on top, but with a trick: no measurements. We were given flour and butter and the memory of how our grandmothers did it when they had time and a day that wasn\u2019t trying to kill them. I rolled my shoulders and listened to my wrists. The tent breathed. Outside, the winter reconsidered its position.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t rush the turns,\u201d Jill mouthed, and I nodded, pocketing the advice with the lavender oil and my grandmother\u2019s whispered remember to salt the fruit. The oven in front of me clicked once, like a cat offended, and I tapped its side and told it we were not playing games today.\n\nIf the signature is a confession you choose, the technical is a test you don\u2019t get to study for. Butter is a language that doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re good with words. It cares if you are patient when everyone around you is not. It cares if you can let a thing be cold enough to say yes. I listened when the dough told me to stop. I turned and chilled and turned again until my elbows wanted their own lives. I drew the leaf lines with the back of a knife, not too hard, the way you trace your name on fogged glass to remind yourself you can make a mark without breaking anything.\n\nAs we slid our pastry into ovens, I caught the boy with the meringue blessing looking at my station with a quick, guilty eye. It wasn\u2019t a thief look. It was a pilgrim look. He lifted his head and met me and flushed and then smiled in a way that was like a telegram: I like your work. Don\u2019t tell.\n\nJill caught my look and let her fingers drum three times on her thigh, our old code for later. When my pithivier rose, it did the thing a heart does when someone speaks kindly to it. It flaked at the edges like a good secret. It browned the way labor pays attention.\n\nThe ranking was kind to me without being obscene. I was called second because the top had a place where I had pressed too hard and the judge found the mean joy of a technicality. I let the tease be what it was. The Nanaimo Bar Man grinned as if he\u2019d been made valedictorian and given a pie to hold. The woman from the North Shore cut her piece too soon and apologized in a way that made me want to wrap her in a towel and send her home with soup.\n\nWe had a breath before the showstopper, and in that breath the light shifted the color of the walls. The tent felt more like a room and less like a machine. My knees remembered the hotel carpet. The gold paper memory slid its hand into mine and didn\u2019t squeeze so much as steady. I looked for the man in the navy cap because the brain is a dog that wants a scent. The crowd behind the tape looked like a science fair had married a farmer\u2019s market. Faces, coats, expectant eyes. Someone held up a sign with nothing on it because they had forgotten the marker. A child licked a candy cane as if it could give answers. In the far corner a figure in a coat too appropriate lingered and then left, like guilt. I promised myself I would stop making strangers into threats until they proved themselves worthy of the promotion.\n\n\u201cMake me a cage,\u201d I told my hands. \u201cMake me a cage so good that getting out of it feels like learning to breathe again.\u201d The showstopper brief said to construct an architectural showpiece with at least three textures and a narrative throughline. I looked at the clock and at the face of the judge who would raise an eyebrow when my sugar ran on me if I let it.\n\n\u201cBe kind to the eggs,\u201d I wrote on the corner of my mind where the notebook usually lives. \u201cRemember to breathe.\u201d Then I cracked and whisked and caramelized like a person who had finally, after years of being almost, stopped rehearsing her courage and brought it to the table, even if the table shook.",

I brought the temperature up slow, listening for that small change in sound that happens just before soft crack, the whisper that is almost a whistle. The copper pot felt alive under my hand, as if it had a small animal curled inside it that might run if I turned my head. I kept the brush moving around the interior in gentle sweeps, water taming the crystals that wanted to climb the sides and colonize the rim. When the syrup lifted from the spoon in thin, bright threads that tried to pull back to themselves like spiders returning home, I took it off the heat and breathed the way you do before stepping into a freezing river. There is a window when sugar forgives you for every time you have rushed it. There is also a window when it remembers an insult. I decided to be forgiven.\n\nThe dacquoise layers had baked to the color of a well-loved book page and were cooling obediently on the rack I had commandeered like a pirate with a sense of fairness. The rhubarb mousse had set enough to hold its shape and not so much that it would sulk when asked to spread. The chokecherry reduction simmered low, a dark garnet ribbon that made a sound I knew as well as my name. Jill brought me ice in a metal bowl without being asked and set it within reach of my left hand the way she sets a bag of saline by a bed, visible but not demanding. She did not hover; she orbited. When I needed another bowl, it was in my hand. When I needed to not see anyone who wasn\u2019t my sister, she acquired height and radiated intent and people discovered they had somewhere else to be.\n\nI poured the sugar in a thin stream over a greased, inverted copper bowl and let my wrist move in the little motions it has learned from handwriting and whisking. You cannot force lattice. You have to suggest the path and let heat remember how to draw. Thread on thread, a dome began to appear, less a cage than a promise of one, the negative space more important than the sugar itself. The tent lights caught on the strands and made them look wetter than they were. Somewhere to my left someone said, \u201cDamn,\u201d with reverence, and I knew without looking that their caramel had gone too far and tipped bitter. The discipline required to not look was a new kind of muscle I was growing right there on television.\n\nTwice the sugar refused a line and balled itself; twice I resisted the old instinct to fix the past by touching it again. I started another thread a centimeter away and pretended I had planned that gap. Gaps are kindness in architecture; they let light through, and air, and whatever is watching you breathe. My fingers trembled once, and I let them, because hands that are held too still tear fine things. I spoke to the sugar under my breath and told it a story about winter on a farm, about a grandmother who could make butter listen simply by laying her palm on the churn. I thought about making cathedrals out of nothing and how the first time I\u2019d heard that word used on something I made I had laughed because it sounded like flattery that wanted to be a blessing.\n\nThe reduction needed a stir and the mousse needed faith. I layered dacquoise and mousse in the ring mold, spread the chokecherry like a band of mischief through the middle, a line of tart truth. I pressed in another layer with the heel of my hand and heard the quiet compression that tells you the structure will hold its own story. There is a small thrill in un-molding something that has been holding its breath; you say now as if you are cutting a ribbon, and if the cake agrees it will let its sides slip and settle and you will look like a person who is brave. The rhubarb held; the frosting I had not called frosting smoothed under the spatula as if it had been waiting for this moment and not pretending to be shy. I set the dome down over the top and it came to rest with the lightest of taps, a bell that had just remembered it is a bell.\n\nTwice during that hour a shadow leaned too close to my table and twice Jill moved between sunlight and interference with the unremarkable authority of a streetlight changing. The second time she touched the sleeve of a man in a navy cap with a smile I recognized as the one she gives to patients who are seconds from bolting. He pretended to be interested in the Thunder Bay teacher\u2019s custards. She bent toward him and said something too low for me to hear, and he stiffened in a way that told me a name had been spoken that belonged to him, or to someone he feared. He retreated. She watched him go and then did not return to me immediately, which meant she was not finished mothering the perimeter.\n\nWhen the clock called three minutes and the host made the universal gesture for we are nearly done pretending this is about time, I placed the sugared cranberries at the base of the dome, a ring of winter frost that made the whole thing look less like a trap and more like a lantern. The chokecherry dripped in exactly the two places that cameras like and exactly the two places where a judge might say, what is that for, and then answer themselves. I cleaned the plate again because there is no such thing as too much kindness where plates are concerned. I did not touch my water without watching Jill pick it up and put it in my mouth the way you do with a child who is learning to be careful.\n\nWhen we stepped back, the room seemed to lean forward, hundreds of eyes finding ways to become a single gaze. I knew how my piece looked because I had been inside it while I made it, but seeing it from this distance made my chest do a small inward sigh. Under the sugar dome, the pink of the mousse glowed like a summer fruit in a January window, the dacquoise layers visible like strata in a cliff telling history in the way rocks do, the ring of cranberries offering a storybook lie about frost that doesn\u2019t bite. It wasn\u2019t the same as last year. It couldn\u2019t be. But it had the necessary arrogance: the part that says I am fragile and I am not begging you not to touch me.\n\nJudging started at the far end. The Moose Jaw eclairs had grown into a low bridge of p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux and spun sugar and the judges made the kind of sounds people make for engineers who have a sense of humor. The North Shore sourdough woman had made a lighthouse of laminated dough that leaned a degree and a half in the way that makes people love buildings. The Nanaimo Bar Man had built the bar itself into a folly with shining chocolate walls and a roof of praline tile, and I almost forgave him for how he said coconut because the roof was beautiful. The boy with the blessing meringue had made a chapel of pavlova, and I wanted to take his face in my hands and tell him he had permission to be as careful with his own heart as he is with sugar.\n\nWhen they came to me, the silver-haired judge stared at the dome with that unreadable kindness he wears when he is deciding how much truth to tell. He put two fingers to the sugar and lifted. The dome came off with a release that was almost a sigh, a piece of air that had finally been given back. He set it down on the plate with a delicacy you would not associate with a man who had publicly mocked underbaked bottoms. The ringed judge bent close as if to smell the inside of the idea. Her rings flashed; she smiled as if they had flashed on purpose.\n\n\u201cYou made a room,\u201d she said, and I said, because repetition can be a spell, \u201cI made a room,\u201d and then we both laughed and pretended not to. The silver-haired judge slid his knife in and the dacquoise resisted only out of respect for form and then gave way. He lifted a slice that held its line and did not slouch, and I loved it the way you love a child who tells the truth in a crowded room.\n\nHe put the bite in his mouth and closed his eyes, not for the camera, or not entirely. People who know the difference between performance and need can see it when need wins. The ringed judge tasted the chokecherry and her mouth did a small bright pucker she then chased with mousse. She tapped the side of her knife against the plate, the code she uses for herself when her brain is writing while her mouth is a second behind.\n\n\u201cYou built strength into something that looks like it could blow away,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve layered tartness and nostalgia without giving us a lecture. The sugar\u2014\u201d She lifted the dome and touched it with the pad of one finger, quick, like you test the heat of a pan. \u201cThis has the nerve to be decorative and edible. It isn\u2019t just a hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour narrative is clearer than most novels,\u201d the silver-haired judge said, in the tone of an insult to his own reading habits. \u201cMy only quarrel\u2014\u201d He stopped himself with a small inhale that would have made a less practiced mouth its own joke. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t have a quarrel. I suppose\u2026\u201d He turned the plate half an inch. \u201cIf I were very bored and very mean, I would say we\u2019ve seen you do something like this before. Not this, but a cousin. But you know what I\u2019m going to do instead?\u201d He looked up at me and his eyebrow did not rise, because this was not television for a second. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to keep making the things your hands know how to make. That\u2019s the entire point of this ridiculous enterprise.\u201d\n\nIf anyone had touched my shoulder right then I would have tipped over. I kept my hands at my sides because I have learned that grabbing for joy can make it skitter. Jill exhaled somewhere on the edge of the world and the air shifted the smallest fraction. The camera moved away to register someone else\u2019s ecstasy or small breakage, and I loved it for leaving me alone.\n\nAfter judging, there is the purgatory that you are not allowed to call purgatory. Cameras have to capture the sense that the universe could go any way at once, that your fate might be decided by a degree of oven door left ajar or by a judge waking with a different palate. We stood at our benches while crew rolled and whispered and the host made three jokes about Canadians saying sorry that were not exactly jokes, and the audience held its breath because someone had told them breath looks good on TV when it escapes all at once. Jill rested her forearms on the fake fence and looked like a woman who could start a small fire by staring at wood and show mercy while it burned.\n\nThe producer stood just out of reach and made a circle in the air with his forefinger, the sign for we have to do this and then we can all eat. The judges took their places with the tent behind them like a polite volcano. The host said words I have now heard in dreams, and in a voice with a cadence my bones seem to understand. He thanked the crew, the sponsors, the ghost of Canada. He pointed at the table of our showpieces as if we might forget where we had left the parts of ourselves we could not take with us.\n\nWhen they called the name of the person whose tart had failed structurally and whose courage had not failed even then, we clapped with more love than any other clap. When they called the person whose pithivier had leaked and whose showpiece had leaned, we clapped with the kind of clap you give people who did not make anything break except their own hearts a little. The order of names felt like someone counting rearranged coins in their pocket. I forgot to look at Jill. I forgot to breathe. I did the only thing I have learned to do when the future is approaching with confetti or with weather: I pressed my tongue to the roof of my mouth and tasted sugar and salt and lemon, and I kept my face open.\n\nThey said my pen name and then they said my legal name, because the legal team had decided not to fight the poetry of my life today. They said both with equal weight, which is not how anyone has ever said anything to me. The ringed judge\u2019s mouth made the little O of surprise she uses when she is pretending to be surprised and also when she is. The silver-haired judge looked away for one second as if to save me from his attention. The host said something about journeys that did not make me want to punch a wall. The noise came, the sort of polite thunder Canadians produce, respectful and full of feeling, and then it grew because the pipes let it and because cameras had learned to beg for that.\n\nThe gold paper arrived as if it had just been hiding in the rafters again, waiting for permission to become a blizzard. It fell heavier than I remembered, and lighter, because memory has absolute nerve. It caught in my lashes and in my braid and under the edge of my apron and in the crook of my elbow. It found Jill\u2019s hair and pretended to be frost. It touched the sugar dome and made a sound like laughter.\n\nI was ready for it this time, if ready means I didn\u2019t feel like my chest had been cracked open and a light had been poured in too fast. I let it touch me. I let it collect on my skin. I did not try to spit it out when a piece landed at the corner of my mouth, because this was not the first time, and I am a quick study. Jill pushed her hand into the circle of cameras and wiped a piece from my cheek with the back of two fingers, and somebody somewhere will freeze that frame and call it sisterhood. The ringed judge stepped into my orbit and put her hand on my shoulder in a way that would make the gossip pages call her warm and my grandmother call her honest.\n\nWe filmed the other endings. Of course we did. That is part of the deal you make when you agree to turn your private skill into public property. The confetti machine misbehaved exactly twice and was coaxed back into doing what it said on the invoice. The host said different lines that were the same. I stared straight into the camera when told and then stared straight into space when asked. The boy with the meringue blessing cried beautifully for someone else\u2019s arc, which is a skill we don\u2019t teach and probably should. When it was over and the last piece of gold lay down and gave up being air, they let us go, which is not the same thing as being free.\n\nBackstage, the tent is less holy. Backstage, you see the glue. It comforted me. I sat on a folding chair with a cushion somebody had rescued from the craft truck and let my knees do the small knock they had been saving. Jill brought me a bottle with an unfamiliar label and unscrewed it and smelled it like a suspicious animal. She lifted one eyebrow and put it in my hand. I drank because she let me. The water tasted like tin and flowers, which is to say it tasted like now.\n\n\u201cYou did the thing,\u201d she said, and bent to untie my apron with abrupt gentleness that made my eyes heat. \u201cNo one bled. Your sugar behaved. You didn\u2019t let anyone feed you. We still have to talk to two officers with haircuts, but they can wait while I make you eat something that makes chewing mandatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw him,\u201d I said, because I wanted to put words on the space where fear wanted to live. \u201cThe cap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gave me a name that is probably not his and a reason that is definitely not a reason. He wanted to take a photo \u2018for his niece.\u2019 He had the niece age wrong for the show\u2019s demo. He had the look of a person who wants to be where the story is being made because he can\u2019t make any of his own. He will try again somewhere else. He won\u2019t try here. People like that are allergic to women who glare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho wrote the note, then?\u201d I asked, pressing my palm to my thigh where the word had warmed my skin all morning. \u201cIf not production. If not a fan. If not\u2026 a judge.\u201d\n\nJill took something from her pocket and unfolded it and used the corner of her nail to press a crease that had been resisting since last night. \u201cThis is a photo of the footage they pulled,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom the hotel. The waitress. I talked to her in the hallway. She\u2019s nineteen and going to Mount Royal and thinks the show makes January bearable. She cried. She was told to deliver a tray to a table by a man who had a lanyard with a pass that looked enough like ours to pass. He pointed at you. He looked like he belonged.\u201d She held the phone for me to look, her hand steady in a way that made me trust the image more than I would have trusted my own eyes. \u201cHe bought the juice from the bar. He kept his thumb over the top of the cup while he walked.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d I said, \u201cthey found nothing in the blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d she said. \u201cThat does not erase motive. That does not erase intention. Sometimes fear eats itself before we can test it. Sometimes love does too.\u201d\n\nThe dressing room mirror had good light, which seemed like a waste. I sat near it and watched my face learn to be a person who had been chosen and not instantly punished for it. Crew people moved through the narrow spaces with competence and low voices and hands that did not touch when touching would carry something in one direction that could not be retrieved. The boy with the meringues stuck his head in the door and put his hand on the frame as if asking permission to be himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not being weird,\u201d he said, which is always the second sentence of someone being weird. \u201cI just\u2026 I\u2019m going to the parking lot. The cameras are at the other door. If you want to leave like a human and not a harvest, I know the way.\u201d\n\nJill looked at me in the mirror in the way she has when her face is the only safe place I can check how I\u2019m doing. I nodded. We left through the hallway where the cables are fat as snakes and the floor has a sticker every three feet instructing you not to trip. In the shadow between two truck backs, the air smelled like exhaust and sugar and a spicy meat that made me think of stampede and summer and being dumb on purpose. The boy walked in front as if clearing the way and then veered off with an embarrassed wave, as if he had done something kind and could not bear to watch us use it.\n\nOutside, Calgary was a city again instead of a backdrop. The sky had decided to be gentle. My knees remembered how to be unremarkable. Jill\u2019s car had a thin skin of grit that meant she had driven enough this winter to have stories I hadn\u2019t heard. When I opened the passenger door, something rustled under my foot. Not a note. An envelope, yes, but the wrong kind; not hotel paper with its stupid crest, not production with its practical branding. Brown, the color of bakery bags, with my pen name and my legal name written in a hand that tried to be careful and missed some letters on purpose, like they\u2019d been trying to forget how to do cursive and failed.\n\nThe interior smelled like the kind of lavender old women grow and rescue when the first frost comes. Inside was a clipping from a local paper with my photo from the first week of the show, your standard \u201clocal baker makes good\u201d piece, and a photo torn carefully from the previous year\u2019s entertainment section, the one with three faces blurred by confetti that meant to be three winners and was not. There was a third piece of paper, not a note. Two words. One written by a hand that has lived out in the cold. The other underlined. Remember. Please.\n\nJill held the envelope between two fingers like an uncertain rescue. \u201cWhere was this?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d I said, because my tongue refused to invent. \u201cThe floor. Or the universe. It\u2019s hard to tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cRead the back,\u201d she said, and I turned the clipping over as if it were a creature that might arc and bite. On the back, the cut that had taken my face out of the page had nicked two lines of text from an advertisement. Do you have something you want to get back? Affordable. Discreet. The phone number had been cut to leave only a city code and two digits. It could be a joke. It could not.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s from a kind person or the other kind?\u201d I asked, and kneaded the edge of the envelope until it softened and probably compromised the integrity of its fibers in a way that would infuriate an archivist.\n\n\u201cI think we don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, which is a thing I am still learning is not a failure but an honest position. \u201cI think we keep it. I think we show it to the haircut men after you sleep. I think we find out who got paid for something they didn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nOn the way back to the hotel, I fell asleep with my forehead against the cool glass and dreamed, not of gold, but of paper. Not confetti, but book pages, the kind with foxing around the edges that makes the air smell like cinnamon. In the dream, I turned the pages and on each was a recipe, not written in my hand but in a hand I wanted to trust. Some were familiar. Some were new. The instructions were precise and then, right where I needed them to tell me what to do, they said, Listen. The dream did the small flicker it does when a real memory tries to substitute and then bowed out. When I opened my eyes again, we were on a street that looked like every street if you live in Alberta and love it: snow that has lost its nerve, a pickup with a sticker of a fish and another of a mountain that looks foreign unless you\u2019ve slept there, a man with a dog that looked like he would tell you about the dog if you asked and also if you didn\u2019t.\n\nUpstairs, the paramedics with haircuts were not unkind. They asked me questions about juice and about whether I had enemies. I thought about what an enemy would look like if I had the imagination for them. A face that looks like a friend except for something in the eyes that looks like winter in March. A pair of hands that have never made anything you can eat. A lanyard. Jill answered when my breath did the stupid hitch that makes simple yeses sound like a confession. They took the envelope and promised to bring it back or at least to call for absolution before they lost it.\n\nThe shower in the hotel was designed to make the body remember it has edges. I stood under it until the water ran from hot into that tepid that means the building has decided I have used enough. I scrubbed sugar from the crooks of my elbows and the inside of my wrists and the small tender skin at the base of my thumb where any decent palm-reader could tell you you\u2019re in trouble. When I stepped out, steam had turned the mirror into a lake. I wrote my pen name on it the way a child writes their crush before they remember their mother also uses that mirror, and then I wiped it away with the heel of my hand and wrote my legal name as if it were a curse I was turning back into a charm.\n\nJill had ordered food that spoke the language of sleeping well: bread, soup, a piece of chicken that looked like it would apologize if it were dry. She had taken off her lanyard and hung it over the lamp in a way that made it look like a trophy. The TV was on but muted, a soft gray square of people moving their mouths, and for the first time in a very long time I did not have the urge to put words into their mouths just to make sense of the shapes.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said, when the plates were mostly empty because hunger had been shy and then remembered to show up. \u201cWe go home. You sleep three days. Then you let me in your garage. We find the box you were afraid to open. We open it in daylight. We make it ordinary. If it isn\u2019t ordinary, we will make it into a story that doesn\u2019t hurt when you tell it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good at that,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m a liar with decent intentions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a communicator,\u201d she said, and reached across the small table to steal a piece of bread because she cannot leave anything unfinished. \u201cDo you want me to sleep in the bed with you like we did when the wind sounded like it had teeth?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to stay in the room,\u201d I said. \u201cI want you to stay in my life. I want you to keep pretending my water is medicine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I can do,\u201d she said, and turned off the lamp before I could see her eyes go soft. \u201cSleep,\u201d she added, and the word landed with the authority of a command that knows it will be obeyed.\n\nSleep came like a polite guest. I dreamed of the neurologist\u2019s hands again, not touching my head this time but setting down a slice of cake on a plate with a blue rim, and saying, Tell me how you made this, and me saying, First I made a room and then I waited until it wanted me in it. In the morning I woke before my alarm and the city was the kind of gray that feels like a promise and not an apology. My head did not hurt, which seemed rude given the attention I had lavished on it the day before. The note under the pillow had acquired a crease that wasn\u2019t there before, as if the word had gotten up in the night and stretched.\n\nOn the way out, the woman at the front desk gave me a look that belongs to accomplices and handed me a small package wrapped in paper that had seen better days. Inside was a bag of cookies that had been baked in a kitchen where someone else had been in charge of sugar. The tag said: For after, and the handwriting looked like a teenager\u2019s trying to grow up. I put them in my bag with the lavender oil and the green notebook and the envelope I had not given away because every story needs one mystery that is yours alone until it isn\u2019t.\n\nWaskasoo Park looked like it had been waiting to greet me with a silence that wasn\u2019t insulted by company. The geese eyed me and decided I had learned nothing and everything. The house tilted its small tilt and let us in like an old friend who knows you will wipe your feet without being told. In the kitchen, the jar of starter had bubbled up and then fallen and smelled like a person making a decision and then changing their mind. The wooden spoon with the bite marks lay where I had left it, domestic and brave. The light in the late afternoon came through the window over the sink and made the air look full of something you could almost touch.\n\nWe moved laundry baskets to get to the door to the garage. Jill found the key in exactly the place I would have put it if I were a person who puts keys where they belong. The garage has the particular sadness of rooms that hold tools and have also held grief. There was the dent in the drywall from the time I had tried to keep a shelf from falling and used my skull. There was the stripe of oil like a bruise that we joke about and don\u2019t. In the corner, under the pegboard with the odd orphaned wrench and the tape measure that likes to lie, sat the box with the tape that didn\u2019t match mine.\n\nI thought I would hesitate. I didn\u2019t. I lifted it and felt the weight settle into the small muscles in my back that use the word careful like a lullaby. I set it on the workbench that still smells like the summer I tried to teach myself to sand. I cut the tape with the knife that was a gift from someone who thought I should carry a knife. The flaps opened like a breath.\n\nConfetti does not behave once contained. It had found ways to climb into cracks and into the folds of the folded things. It dusted the air as if a memory had been keeping itself ready with small breath exercises. On top lay tissue with a weight you would call cheap if you had never needed it to touch your fingers and remind them that paper is a kind of skin. I moved it aside and there it was, both more and less than I had imagined. The hamper, yes, with its metal corners. A letter on thick paper that said all the things production letters say when they want to be both tidy and kind. A certificate with my name in both its versions and a signature printed from a file. A bottle of maple syrup in a shape people who do not live here find irresistible. A set of measuring spoons that looked like they had been made to live in a drawer where they could tell each other their days. A small gold object that was undeniably a trophy and undeniably not the trophy. A plastic stand-in, heavy with irony and also surprisingly heavy in fact.\n\nI picked it up. The heft felt like the moment I had held it last year in a tent that did not belong to me and also completely did. It had a base with a sticker that had lifted at one corner and been pressed back down by a hand that had cared just enough. It had a problem with its center of gravity that made it tilt if you set it down too quickly. It had dignity if you asked a question in the right tone.\n\nJill lifted the letter and read it because she reads aloud when she knows I am not going to. The words were what they were. Thank you. An honor. Your story. Your dedication. The privacy. The medical team. Your sister. We wish you. The future. The exact phrasing a lawyer can live with and a person can live through. At the bottom, a line that was either carelessness or grace. We hope when you are ready, you will remember how this felt.\n\n\u201cI remembered,\u201d I said, and the air in the garage went warmer by a degree. \u201cBefore I saw any of this, I remembered. Even if it was pretend. Even if it was a rehearsal disguised as a day. The feeling was real.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe feeling is still real,\u201d Jill said, and put her hand over mine on the fake trophy, both of us holding an object that had not been designed to carry this much meaning and was doing it anyway. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe the truth to the order things happened in. You owe it to what it did to you.\u201d\n\nWe stood and let the confetti settle the way dust does when you finally stop walking around in it. The garage was ugly and familiar and held a box that had been waiting for me to come back to myself. Somewhere upstairs a radiator sighed like an old man deciding to be generous. I pulled the green notebook from my pocket and opened to a clean page and wrote, not a recipe, but the first sentence of a chapter I had not let myself write because I thought it would hurt.\n\nStart with water. Then add heat, because everything that matters requires it. Then, when you think you have ruined it by waiting too long, pull back, and see.",

                              "content": "Six is the kind of number a kitchen knows. Six eggs in a carton, six turns in rough puff before you let it rest, six minutes where a custard will ruin if you don\u2019t look at it and decide to love it anyway. In my green notebook I wrote a six with a long tail that looped back on itself and looked like a ribbon that had made peace with becoming something else. Then I put the notebook away because the page would keep until I had hands that weren\u2019t vibrating with the after-image of gold and noise.\n\nWe baked because the house asked us to. The room had been holding its breath while we were gone and you can\u2019t do that to a kitchen and expect it to forgive you. Jill says flour is my religion and when I blushed the first time she said it she looked at me like she had finally figured out a trick drawer. I warmed milk until the surface looked like the top of a lake right before dawn, quivered but not yet convinced to move. In the bottom of the big bowl that used to be our mother\u2019s I sprinkled yeast and sugar and watched it wake like an idea. Cinnamon has its own weather; it bloomed against the air and made January look less sure of itself. I zested orange over my shoulder like the old tales tell you to salt a witch, and the peel fell in bright curls that refused to look ordinary even when I told them this was not television, this was home.\n\nJill leaned against the counter and peeled the paper from a stick of butter with the same efficiency she uses to peel stickers off ambulance equipment. She had taken off the lanyard and folded it small in her pocket, but it still radiated a shape, as if a title can leave an imprint even after it has stopped swinging against your chest. The radio we keep over the fridge for recipes and road conditions and the hockey score murmured quietly. When she sang under her breath I knew she was thinking hard because she only sings when she needs to keep words from spilling out before they\u2019re ready to be caught.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me your dough theory,\u201d she said finally, watching my hands make a well in the flour and then pour the foamy yeast in like a small tide. \u201cWater, heat, pull back and see. Did you write that for the book you\u2019re not writing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wrote it to keep my head from climbing out the window,\u201d I said, pushing in the butter and the eggs and turning the bowl with the heel of my hand. \u201cThough if a book wanted it I wouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d The dough took at first and then fought, the way a skittish animal tests your grip to make sure you\u2019re not lying. I kneaded until it stopped lying to me. I pressed the heel of my hand and lifted and turned and thought about everything my hands have remembered my head has dropped without permission. \u201cI can\u2019t tell where yesterday ends,\u201d I said after a while, because saying nothing makes silence a bully. \u201cI can tell where the oven ended. I can tell where the applause lied politely about how much it meant and then, surprise, meant more. I still can\u2019t tell why there\u2019s a man with a cap in our lives who covers orange juice the way you cover a wounded thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will find out what cap he wears when he thinks no one is looking,\u201d Jill said, and the firmness in her voice made a ridge of comfort lift under my skin. \u201cI talked to the waitress again, away from cameras and managers. He smelled like cologne that\u2019s pretending to be cedar. Not a hotel scent. A person scent. He had a scar on his thumb like he\u2019s cut himself the same way twenty times and didn\u2019t take the hint.\u201d She shook cinnamon into a bowl with brown sugar and a pinch of salt because cinnamon is better when someone interrupts it. \u201cHe will be findable. People like that think they are fog when really they track like a sloppy footprint.\u201d\n\nThere were things we didn\u2019t say and they ran under the surface like fish in a cold river. Our father shaped himself out of the not-said the way fog makes a tree and then lets it go again. A navy cap is a hand-me-down in this part of the world; it could be anyone. It could be a man who buys salted peanuts in gas stations and calls every waitress sweetheart. It could be the person Jill and I used to wait for in the front window when the sky went that particular yellow and we wanted the sound of a truck door and boots on the mat and the smell of oil that meant, for an hour, we were not in charge of comforting ourselves. It could be a stranger with a borrowed cap and a borrowed idea of drama. Truth does not owe you fireworks; sometimes it shows up in a plaid shirt and reminds you to take the garbage out on Wednesday night because that\u2019s when the truck comes.\n\nWe rolled the dough together, which we haven\u2019t done since a September where the light through the maple out back went redder than blood and our mother\u2019s laugh was still attached to our days like a button that might hold. I taught Jill again how to not use too much flour, how to know the exact moment a rolling pin stops being a weapon and starts being a whisper. She taught me again how to breathe with my back when the tightness in my chest wants to graduate up to my throat. We spread the cinnamon sugar and the butter and rolled tight from the long end and pinched like we meant it. I cut with dental floss because knives tear and Jill laughed because it is funny watching a grown woman garrote dough. The spirals looked like time, circles inside circles, nothing entirely original and still the only thing you want to look at for a minute.\n\n\u201cWe have the officer appointment at four,\u201d she said, checking her phone not because it has ever told her something she doesn\u2019t already know but because procedure is a blanket. \u201cWe have the neurologist at two the day after tomorrow. Do you want to see her before the broadcast? She\u2019s going to tell you your brain is a lake with different ice thicknesses and you need to be patient with the spring.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want her cinnamon tea,\u201d I said, and set the pan on the counter and covered it with a clean towel and told the dough to rise and do it evenly, please, like I was talking to a small child I had never met. \u201cAnd I want to ask her if it\u2019s normal to remember confetti like a body memory and not remember a whole person\u2019s face. I want to ask if confetti is bad for neurons.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is bad for neurons if you have trust issues,\u201d Jill said, and put her mouth on my hair for a second the way she did when I was small and had done something I wanted to be punished for so I could stop holding my breath. \u201cEat a half of one when they come out,\u201d she added, because she never does a feeling without a practical instruction. \u201cWe are not visiting anyone\u2019s haircut with low blood sugar.\u201d\n\nWhile the buns rose and swelled and made themselves plump with air they were borrowing, I went into the living room and opened the hamper again as if it could change when I wasn\u2019t looking. The letter had the tone a show uses when it wants you to feel like the tent had kissed your forehead and sent you home with cookies, which it has to because you sign a thing that says they will let you be a story and they will also let you go. The certificate made me laugh because the serif on my legal last name looks like a corner of snow off an eave. There was a photo, face down under the tissue, that I hadn\u2019t noticed. It was the three of us in a row, last year\u2019s final, our faces confetti-baffled into anonymity. Whoever had tucked it in had written in pencil on the back, in a hand that does better with numbers than with curves: all three are real.\n\nI turned it over and didn\u2019t look at the faces, because looking straight at a star is the quickest way to not see it. I let my eyes do the trick they do in museums sometimes, where you pretend you\u2019re interested in the frame and then the painting arrives through a side door in your head. The mouth shape of the person to my left was delicate and stubborn. The line of the jaw of the person to my right was kind. Between us, in a place where cameras love to live, the host\u2019s hand was in the air, his palm shaped like the word Canada. I let the pieces of it talk to each other without me for a minute. Sometimes your understanding shows up late to a conversation and still has the nerve to interrupt.\n\n\u201cAnika,\u201d I said, and the name landed without a splash. \u201cAnika D\u2019Souza. She teaches kindergarten during the week and runs a pop-up at the strip mall on Saturdays. Last year they aired her win in June and her dad cried on television in a shirt that everybody called lucky. Her showstopper had sugar glass for windows and they fogged when she breathed near them, and she wiped one with the hem of her apron, and the camera did not miss it.\u201d\n\nJill looked up from the stove where she was making a glaze the color of something you wish you had had a chance to swim in when you were a kid. She nodded once. \u201cShe sent a thank-you to craft for the cookies. It\u2019s in the binder.\u201d She hesitated and then did the honest thing instead of the easy one. \u201cShe came to the hospital. The night you forgot. She didn\u2019t come in. She sat in the waiting room for an hour and then she went away. She caught my eye when I came out for water and she made a face like an apology that had been sitting in her mouth too long and had started to taste like paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind,\u201d I said, because it is and I needed to say it out loud. \u201cThat\u2019s beyond the NDA protocol kind.\u201d I did not ask why no one had told me then or later because I knew. You triage. You save the person. You leave the story to nod to you at the door and go home with a different person who will sleep because they don\u2019t have to decide what you are to them yet. \u201cDo you think she wrote the note?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe handwriting on the car envelope had a wobble that felt like cold fingers,\u201d Jill said, setting the pan with buns on the counter and making the air do that small shout. \u201cShe lives three provinces east. The paper smelled like someone\u2019s dresser. The hotel note had no perfume at all, which is its own perfume.\u201d She took a fork and nudged a swirl, checking the center for done-ness the way you check a decision. \u201cEat. No heroics.\u201d\n\nThe bun was soft as it looks in cookbooks even though it usually isn\u2019t, because photographers are liars with the best intentions. The glaze stuck to my lip and I licked it without worrying if someone would clip the moment and make me into a particular kind of woman who equates sugar with need because I am none of the kinds of woman cameras try to flatten and also I am all of them. The cinnamon burned in the smallest good way down the back of my throat. My shoulders dropped the part of a shrug they were still carrying. On the radio, a woman with a voice like a real river told a story about a deer that had gotten itself tangled in someone\u2019s Christmas lights and how three neighbors and a teen with dyed hair had solved it without calling anyone official. The teen said, on air, \u201cIt bowed to me,\u201d and laughed in a way that made me sure the deer had, in fact, bowed.\n\nAt two, the neurologist\u2019s office smelled like papers that have been filed and refiled by careful hands and tea that is more cinnamon than leaf. She wore the same cardigan she always wears, a dark blue that makes her look like a library come to life. She doesn\u2019t patronize my brain; she flirts with it. She sets her pen down when she talks to you about your own head, as if she is asking permission to take your pulse. When I told her about the juice and the light that rose behind my eyes and then cracked and poured and the memory of gold that followed, she made the face she makes when she is pleased to have a good metaphor to play with.\n\n\u201cYou know how sugar is supersaturated?\u201d she asked, and because the universe sometimes likes to tickle you in the ribs when you have talked about cages and glass and heat all day, I smiled. \u201cYou dissolve too much into too little water and then you get a clear solution that looks like lenience. You hang a thread in it and crystals collect. You thought you had a liquid. You get a city.\u201d She poured tea and handed it to me and I didn\u2019t reach for the medical words because sometimes the making of a city in your own head is enough. \u201cYou\u2019ve had head trauma. You\u2019ve had a diagnosis I don\u2019t hand out to people who don\u2019t need it. The memory is still there, just\u2026 unhooked from the index. An event, a smell, a chemical change can sometimes put its finger on the card and whisper, Here. Confetti is an excellent card. It is silly and intense and it sticks. Your brain isn\u2019t making things up. It\u2019s picking up a thread.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about a man with a cap who covers a cup?\u201d Jill asked, because she will put her body between me and a word if she thinks the word has a sharp edge. \u201cWhat about the kind of fear that looks like an adrenaline problem and manifests like someone stole a piece of your breath and hid it under a table at a hotel breakfast?\u201d\n\nThe neurologist did not pretend to a police degree she didn\u2019t have. She crossed one leg and the other and nodded. \u201cWe are built to be jumpy,\u201d she said. \u201cYour sister\u2019s body sees fear and chooses a plan. Your body sees fear and remembers something else while choosing a plan. Our job is to make sure you\u2019re safe enough to let the remembering happen without scaring your body into quitting its job. Also, citrus can tilt people. Adrenergic surges tilt people. A sip of juice, a bad night\u2019s sleep, a brain with a soft spot, a person behind you who isn\u2019t your sister, a feeling that someone is photographing your breath\u2014any one thing would be manageable. Together they sound the alarm.\u201d She smiled and it didn\u2019t feel like a trick. \u201cIf you had collapsed into my office I would have given you the same tea and told you the same thing. Your brain is not your enemy. It is also not your most reliable narrator. That\u2019s your job, and you\u2019ve given yourself practice.\u201d\n\nOn the way out, the receptionist pressed a peppermint into my palm the way grandparents used to when they didn\u2019t know how else to feed a kid who didn\u2019t say much. The peppermint tasted like memory and I had the grace to laugh at myself right there under a poster for stroke awareness. In the parking lot, a truck idled in a way that says we don\u2019t trust machines unless they are making noise. A man in a navy cap was sitting in the passenger seat, his elbow on the rolled-down window, his fingers tapping an old rhythm on the door. He lifted his head when we walked by and looked right through us with a politeness that might have been fear wearing manners.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t smell like cedar,\u201d Jill said when we were in the car. \u201cHe smells like chewing tobacco and winter. He smells like home to someone else.\u201d She turned the key and we did the small city choreography of yielding and insisting. \u201cHe\u2019s not ours.\u201d\n\nAt the caf\u00e9 on Ross Street, the barista with the green hair spotted me and lifted both her arms in a V that made everybody in the room look at me and then look away because Canadians are not allowed more than two seconds of public attention at a time without a chalkboard and a raffle ticket. She poured me a coffee without asking and then leaned across the counter in a way that would have made our mother cough but would make any young person proud.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, whispering exaggeratedly because she does not actually know how to whisper. \u201cI saw you from the TV internet and I will not talk about it unless you want me to, but I will say I am, like, resonating in your direction. Also, there was a guy in a cap. Not, like, the aesthetic cap, but a cap, cap. He came yesterday after you left. He asked if Ms. Lumen is your real name or your fake name and I said, like, obviously real because your whole vibe is nightlight. He said he wanted to leave a gift and I was like, you can leave in general. I told him to write it down and he did. I threw it out because it tasted like creep. Sorry if it was actual information.\u201d\n\n\u201cDescribe his cap,\u201d Jill said, and the girl did, with a precision that made me want to offer her a job in intelligence and also a scone. Blue. Frayed at the back. Not a team. Not a brand. The brim stained on the underside like he had used it to wipe his hands when he needed to look less dirty.\n\n\u201cHe said your book changed his wife\u2019s life,\u201d she added, and then saw it land and flushed. \u201cI know you don\u2019t have a book yet. He said it anyway. He looked like he lies for a living but also like he might not know when he is doing it because it feels like a blanket.\u201d\n\nI put two dollars in the tip jar, which is an insult and I knew it; I put another ten because I know how hurt can make you cheap and I have been trying to feed the part of me that wants to do better. We took the corner table and I put my back where I could see the door and not in the habit of doing that felt like a second language I had acquired without effort. I took out the green notebook because a person who doesn\u2019t write down the shape of their fear will find it getting bigger when they sleep. I wrote down cap, cedar, cedar-not, the shape of a thumb scar, the way voices change when the memory you get back is a relief disguised in a crisis. I wrote down Anika\u2019s name because gratitude is easier to feel if you give it letters. I wrote down our mother\u2019s name, which I almost never do, because it behaves like sourdough starter in a warm kitchen: it grows when you feed it and it makes the whole place smell like life.\n\nThe officers with the haircuts were at the kitchen table at four with a notepad that had coffee ring hierarchy printed into its corners and pens that click like turning a light on and off. They were kind in the way people are kind when they think you have something they need and they\u2019re not going to get it unless you are on their side. They asked me to tell them the story the way you ask someone who has done a magic trick to do it again but slower. I told them about the breakfast juice and the light and Jill\u2019s hand and the carpet and the way fear can sit in your body and ask for a chair. I told them about the envelope in the car and the handwriting that had made my shoulder blades itch with recognition without actually handing me a face to attach it to. I told them about the waitress and the cap and the thumb, and they nodded at the right places like they\u2019ve learned to do in a training where actors pretend to be sad.\n\n\u201cDo you have any reason to think someone would want to keep you from competing?\u201d the older one asked, using the verb want like it was hand-stitched. \u201cAnyone who thinks your success will cost them something? Anyone who thinks your presence affects the integrity of the show? Sometimes people mislay their manners when cameras are involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople mislay their manners when nothing is involved,\u201d Jill said, and the officer did not argue, which made me like him better. \u201cThe show\u2019s compliance team told us your compliance team told them to tell us not to have contact with last year\u2019s finalists. They also told us they think they allowed for a loophole that puts my sister in a bracket nobody thought to define. You\u2019re going to find a lot of people with opinions. You\u2019re going to find fewer with evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about family?\u201d the younger one said, not in an accusatory way, more like a person stepping lightly onto ice that will either hold or won\u2019t. \u201cAnyone who has a quarrel with the name on your paperwork? Anyone who wants you to remember differently or remember them first?\u201d\n\nThe room changed shape around that question the way a loaf changes shape if you slash it too deep before it goes into the oven. I could feel the air rearrange itself, and the weight of our mother\u2019s absence made a paler hole and the weight of our father\u2019s particular kind of presence pressed lightly on the edge of the tablecloth. I do not like lying. I do not like telling truths I don\u2019t own yet either. \u201cWe have a father,\u201d I said carefully. \u201cHe has a cap. He has opinions about how people should and should not present themselves to a world that might want to comment. He left before the part where people get good at making up after. He is not a person who buys a hotel lanyard to make his life more interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a father,\u201d Jill echoed with a small break in her voice that she ironed with the back of her hand because you can do that, if you start young. \u201cHe could fill this room with attention without moving his feet. When he wants to be seen he uses his whole face. If that man was trying to be unseen, he isn\u2019t ours.\u201d\n\nThey took down names I gave them and names I did not give them and names they would make for themselves when they filed this and then forgot it and then remembered it when it intersected with something louder. They took the envelope from the car and promised to call if the lab proved it had anything more interesting to tell me than lavender and time. The older one looked at the buns on the counter in a way that made me want to feed him like a stray cat and I did, because feeding people is one of the only things I know how to do that consistently feels like a solution. He ate slowly and with respect, and when he left he said my pen name because he\u2019d looked it up on his phone while pretending to check for messages. The younger one put a card where the note had been, a kind of replacement magic.\n\nNight is a different animal in a house where someone has recently put confetti in the trash. It rustles. It thinks it has earned the right to remind you that it knows how to be louder than you. I walked through the rooms and touched the backs of chairs and the edges of doorways and the kitchen table with my fingertips like I was taking its pulse. Jill took a shower and the water hit the tile in a pattern I could have written down in notation if I had that kind of brain. I sat on the floor in front of the couch and pulled the hamper toward me again because I am not done with things until they stop humming.\n\nUnder the maple syrup bottle and the tissue and the silly gold stand-in trophy that was heavier than embarrassment, there was a card I hadn\u2019t seen, slipped between the measuring spoons like it wanted them to make the discovery instead of me. It was on cheap cardstock and the ink had bled a bit, the way ink does when it meets a hand that has held it too long. It said: you made my mother cry, which I would have put aside as either troll or compliment if not for what was under it. A pressed sprig of lavender, not from a hotel lobby arrangement, but from a bush that has survived three winters and decided not to die out of sheer obstinacy. It stained the tissue in a vein the shape of a road I have yet to learn by heart.\n\nI put it back because I don\u2019t like to finish mysteries I cannot ask questions to, and also because it made me want to call a person whose number I don\u2019t have. It pressed up against a part of my chest that had gotten used to hollowness. I thought of girls who learn to carry chest cavities like Tupperware. I thought of women who learn to carry other people\u2019s containers and snacks and shame and never say no. I thought of my mother, and of a day where the wind had sounded like it had teeth, and of everything we got good at surviving and everything we still refuse to.\n\nThe knock at the door was not polite. It was the kind that taps a rhythm that is older than you and expects you to recognize it because it has been in your house before. Jill froze in the hallway with her hair in a towel and her feet bare and her face clean and naked in a way that made her look like both of us before we learned our thin-blooded calm. I stood because you stand for some names even if you don\u2019t say them. I put my hand on the table, then the chair, then the doorknob, because touching wood and metal is a way of reminding yourself you live in a world where physics applies.\n\nWhen I opened the door, the winter moved a foot into the hallway like a person who is sure of themselves and still too polite to push past. The man on the porch had a navy cap that had been run through too many summers and not enough washing machines. He held it in his hands, which I took as a sign he had either used his manners tonight or had learned to perform them. His jacket was the kind of brown that stores oil stains like secrets. He had the eyes that belong to the people we come from in this place, the ones the color of soil that is good for something if you put the time in. His mouth was our mother\u2019s mouth, which is an unfair trick biology plays when it wants to mess with you. He looked at me like he had been practicing not to look at me while still making sure I knew the practice was for my benefit.\n\n\u201cKid,\u201d he said, and the word entered the house like it had been waiting at the door the whole time, stamping its feet against the cold, and I felt the floor tilt and settle, and behind me Jill made a noise a paramedic only makes when she is not at work and the person in front of her is either down or about to be.",

                              "content": "He said it the way men say it when the word has done too much work for them and they don\u2019t know where else to put their hands. The cap sat between his palms like a small animal he\u2019d trapped accidentally. Heat from the house met the cold at his back and made a little fog around his shoulders, and I had the odd, disloyal thought that weather had always loved him more than we had because it never asked him to apologize for anything. Jill tightened the towel on her head like a helmet and took two silent steps toward the door without deciding if she meant to let him in or turn him away. I moved aside because I have been practicing the part of me that doesn\u2019t decide for other people when the air in a room changes.\n\nHe looked smaller than the version of him my body keeps in storage for emergencies. The jacket tugged at one shoulder as if gravity had signed a contract with his bones. His hair had gone from the color of wheat at the end of a season to the color of rope left out in the sun for years, and the skin around his eyes had the map of a man who squints for a living at horizons that do not move. \u201cYou going to leave me on the step?\u201d he asked, and his voice had the riverbed of apology in it without any water yet. \u201cOr you going to let me say the thing that\u2019s been chewing on me for a day and a half?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoots,\u201d Jill said, and stood back in a way that was not consent so much as triage. \u201cOn the tray. If there is salt on them, you wipe it yourself. You do not drip on her floor.\u201d\n\nHe obeyed, which would have been funny in a different decade. He set the cap on the radiator like a head that needed warming and stamped off the last of the porch. The smell came with him, not cedar and performance, but oil, cold metal, the sweet stale of a cab where someone eats their lunch with the window cracked because they don\u2019t trust the seals. There was tobacco under it, not chewing, not smoke, the ghost of a habit carried by other men he used to stand beside. He kept his eyes down until he didn\u2019t, and when he raised them, they found the places in my face that match his and stayed there too long.\n\n\u201cI seen you,\u201d he said, and gestured vaguely at the part of the house that holds the television, as if fame were a farm implement he could pick up and examine when it stopped by. \u201cTwice. Once last year and I wasn\u2019t supposed to make a fuss, and once yesterday, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I was supposed to make any noise at all. I figured it out when the weather went to hell in my chest. You\u2019re not asleep in it anymore. That\u2019s good. I brought\u2026 I didn\u2019t bring flowers.\u201d He looked at his hands like he\u2019d meant to surprise us and had surprised himself. \u201cI brought this.\u201d\n\nHe fumbled in the pocket of the jacket and came out with something wrapped in newspaper and bound with twine that had been tied by someone who has short patience for knots. He untied it and unrolled the paper on the kitchen table with care that fought his bones, then stood back like a magician who doesn\u2019t like the attention part. It was a photograph in a plastic frame the color of tea, the kind you get in a drugstore because you don\u2019t go into places where clerks ask you questions. My mother was in it, in her red sweater that throws a net over my heart every time I see it, hair up in a way you\u2019d call careless if you hadn\u2019t watched her do it with absolute attention. She held a pie with both hands like it was the only baby she had ever agreed to carry. The porch behind her was the porch of the house before this one, peeling paint in strips that looked like someone had tried to take the sky off. My father was in the corner of the frame, cut off at the shoulder, his hand visible, steadying the pan, his thumb a little too close to the heat and not minding.\n\n\u201cI found it behind the toolbox,\u201d he said, and looked at me because he knows how to find a useful prop when he\u2019s come unarmed. \u201cI took it when we moved and I meant to give it back when you were settled and then I forgot where I put it and then I forgot how to knock like a person who doesn\u2019t expect to be told to get back in his truck. I thought maybe she\u2019d want to be in the house with you when you\u2014\u201d He lifted his chin toward the counter where the hamper sat like proof and like a joke. \u201cWhen you brought trouble home.\u201d\n\nJill snorted softly and then turned it into a cough because somewhere along the way she learned how to keep blood in and sound out. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you called it when you left,\u201d she said, and he met her with a look that didn\u2019t dodge so much as accept a punch.\n\n\u201cI called it leaving before I did something we couldn\u2019t fix,\u201d he said, and I could feel the room recognize his particular talent of saying the thing that wins and costs him at once. \u201cTurns out that\u2019s still doing something you can\u2019t fix. I ain\u2019t here to argue my way into your good graces. I\u2019m here because your sister sent me a message like a siren wrapped in a napkin. She said someone tried to scare you back into sleeping and it didn\u2019t take. She said there\u2019s a man thinks caps make him invisible.\u201d He bent and put two fingers on the photograph the way people used to swear on a Bible. \u201cI don\u2019t like men who think that. I been that man. He is not me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen were you at the hospital?\u201d I asked, because it seems I have decided I will commit to the worst angle in a photograph if it gets me closer to what a thing is. \u201cJill says you make a room full of attention without moving your feet. Did you mend yourself small and sit under a painting and wait for the tilt of a door?\u201d\n\nHe made the face he makes when he has to choose between lying and not talking. \u201cThe night they told me you didn\u2019t know your name,\u201d he said, and looked past me for the first time like the wall had something to say to him that wasn\u2019t my face. \u201cI stood outside the sliding doors and I didn\u2019t come in because I was mad at everybody who knew how to say it like they weren\u2019t proud of the sound. I went to the park by the statue with the eagle and I sat on a bench with a coffee and I hated myself for twenty minutes and then I got up and went to the desk and said your name and the girl there was nineteen and had a smile like a knife, and she said, \u2018She has her sister,\u2019 and I turned around and left because I ain\u2019t never been good at being the second best helper in a room.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have also never been good at being the first,\u201d Jill said, but the edge in her voice softened a fraction, because there are sentences that let your shoulders drop without your permission and this was one of them. \u201cWho is he?\u201d she asked, and the he in her mouth had a sound the air knows to attach to a stranger with a bad idea. \u201cThe one at the hotel. Cedar cologne. Thumb scar. He held the cup like it was a coin he was putting on someone\u2019s eyelids.\u201d\n\nMy father looked at the radiator where the cap lay like a small animal that had decided it would not be tamed. He took it in his hands again and turned it once the way you turn a problem to see if there\u2019s a door you missed. \u201cCould be a dozen men I know and none of them,\u201d he said slowly, as if moving heavy words from one side of his mouth to the other and weighing them. \u201cCould be a hand from the yard over on the south road. Could be a cousin to the man runs the tow out at the second bridge. Could be a customer from the parts store who thinks we\u2019re friends because I know the part number he needs without looking. You want me to make it easy and say Walt. You want me to say Hank. I don\u2019t have a Hank to give you that would make your mouth look less like your mother\u2019s when she decided not to cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you put under my windshield,\u201d I asked, and his eyes sharpened the smallest bit, which is how I know I had walked into a room he had thought was locked. \u201cEnvelope in the car. Brown. My names on it like someone couldn\u2019t choose which one to be mad at.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t reach for innocence like a rag. He set the cap down again and put his palms flat on the table and stared at the knuckles that look like mine. \u201cI wrote you in July,\u201d he said, the month the mouth you keep for winter tries and fails to say like a song. \u201cCold fingers, yeah, because I don\u2019t keep paper in the house the way your mother did and I found a stub in the glove box and a pencil that had been chewed by something with small teeth. I wrote \u2018Remember, please,\u2019 because I couldn\u2019t think of anything with manners that didn\u2019t sound like a command. I left it on your car three times and took it back off once because I saw you coming out with your hair up and your face like a woman walking between rooms in her own house and I got scared you\u2019d look up and see me and make a sound I couldn\u2019t live under.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat were you asking me to remember?\u201d I said, and the question came out softer than I expected, which is what happens when you go in braced for a punch and find a place to sit down instead. \u201cThe tent? The show? Your existence? Hers?\u201d I touched the photograph and the plastic clicked under my fingernail. \u201cWhat debt did you think I owed the past that it was mine to pay with what I had left?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat summer,\u201d he said, and his voice hoarded the heat the radiator threw off. \u201cThere was a day you came by the yard with a pie you\u2019d cooled by the window like in a joke and you gave it to the boys and me because you were mad at me for something and you didn\u2019t want to say it like words. You said it like butter. They ate it with their hands like dogs and said thank you without swallowing, and I watched you hold their hunger like it was nothing and like it was something that might kill you if you put it down wrong. I wanted you to know that wasn\u2019t for nothing. I wanted you to remember that before a camera said you were a thing, you were one. I wanted you to remember me saying it. I haven\u2019t made a lot of good sentences in my life. I wanted one.\u201d\n\nJill loosened her towel and let her hair fall because something in his words had reached past the part of her that keeps the doors closed and found the couch. She looked at me and I looked at her and we did the small math we have always done quickly, weighing mercy against pattern, safety against need. \u201cYou didn\u2019t write the hotel note,\u201d she said, and my father shook his head in a way that made muscle ripple down the side of his jaw. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell a girl to carry a tray in after being told not to.\u201d He shook his head again. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me you know who did,\u201d she added, and he stopped moving and put a breath back in his chest.\n\n\u201cI know men who like the way fear looks on a mouth,\u201d he said, choosing every word like he was being charged for them. \u201cI know men who carry lanyards and learn a smile that does the same job whether it\u2019s honest or not. I know a man who thinks he makes television and really he makes his own story about how he\u2019s the kind who can. But I don\u2019t have a name that fits your juice. I have a feeling, and that\u2019s a bad thing to bring to a house where women make a living with their hands. I brought the picture because I knew you\u2019d be able to forgive the past easier than you can forgive the present.\u201d\n\nI thought about every time I\u2019ve grated butter against a bowl and pretended I wasn\u2019t asking the world for a favor. I thought about the way my grandmother used to tie her apron strings with a knot that held even when you tried to make it not, and the way my mother would lick a thumb and press the corner of a child\u2019s mouth and say, there, without looking to see if it helped. \u201cDid you watch last year,\u201d I asked, and it felt like putting a hand into a hive. \u201cDid you watch the confetti. Did you sit there and say that\u2019s my kid, and did you do it out loud in a room with no one in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI watched all three,\u201d he said without flinching, giving me the decoy truth and the real one in one parcel. \u201cI watched them all and swore at the host and told the man to his face that he was full of himself even though he couldn\u2019t hear me. I watched the one where they said your name and I stood up so fast I knocked over a coffee and told the trailer I\u2019d built with my own hands I was sorry for yelling in it. Then I turned it off because I know how stories work when they\u2019ve got bills to pay, and I waited for my phone to ring and set on the table and didn\u2019t answer it when it did because I didn\u2019t know whether you would know you had been happy. I didn\u2019t want to be the person who broke it if you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI rested my forehead against the door for a second because sometimes wood will hold the part of your head that needs holding more tenderly than a hand. The quiet grew a spine. \u201cDo you know about the box,\u201d I said, and he smiled with the corner of his mouth that looks like mine and then like Jill\u2019s and then like a stranger\u2019s I would trust because he told the truth about his tools.\n\n\u201cI put it in the garage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came while you were at your sister\u2019s, and I didn\u2019t want some kid to lift it off your step because they thought it might have something shiny in it. I thought you\u2019d be back in two hours or two days and then you weren\u2019t, and I made a joke at the post office about how the television owes people better packaging and the girl there told me I was being old. I wrote you \u2018remember\u2019 because I couldn\u2019t stand the idea that the person who carried that tinsel home in her hair would fold a piece of paper over it and put it on a shelf and call it someone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nJill put two bowls on the table like she was dealing cards, because food is how we buy time when ideas show up that require different shoes. She sat and gestured at the chairs and looked like a captain letting a mutinous crew decide whether they wanted to live. \u201cSit,\u201d she said to him, and it sounded like a dare and a permission. \u201cEat what she made. Then tell us why you really came, because no one drives in January to bring back a picture unless they are either dying or trying not to. And you look like a man who has decided not to.\u201d\n\nHe sat, and the chair made the small complaint the old ones make because they used to belong to air and now they have to hold people. He ate the cinnamon bun as if someone had taught him finally, late in his life, that you can say thank you without your mouth being empty, and a part of me that has been mean to him for years because meanness is easier than the alternative took a step back. He wiped the glaze from his knuckle with his thumb and looked at it like it might tell him his blood type. \u201cI came because a man left a note on my truck at the yard yesterday,\u201d he said at last, and Jill\u2019s body leaned forward an inch in a way no one would see but me because I am fluent in her. \u201cNot a note like mine. Printed. With a phone number that didn\u2019t have enough numbers. It said, \u2018Tell her to sit this one out. You don\u2019t want to be sorry twice.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe word twice found all my soft places and pressed. Somewhere under the floor the furnace turned over and went back to work without waiting for permission. \u201cWho hates us economically,\u201d I asked, because there are only so many stories in a small city and you learn to label them so they don\u2019t talk to each other at night. \u201cWho loses money if I stand at a counter and make something that doesn\u2019t burn. Who thinks fear will make me polite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can make a list,\u201d he said, and the light in his eyes went the color it gets when he decides a thing is worth doing because he has finally found a way to name it. \u201cIt will be longer than you like and shorter than you think. There ain\u2019t an army of men in hats lined up to keep you from sugaring your own mouth, kid. But there are always two or three who get a kick out of convincing the women they used to sit next to that they\u2019d be prettier quiet. It could be someone from the show who saw last year and thinks this year makes a map of their own smallness. It could be someone from here who doesn\u2019t like that the TV told you your name for you. It could be a man who sells maple syrup at the farmer\u2019s market and hates being corrected about sugar stages. It could be nobody, and the juice was a coincidence, and you\u2019re all right, and I\u2019ll go home and yell at a truck.\u201d\n\nI looked at Jill and saw the way the muscle in her cheek had started to let go. \u201cWe file this,\u201d she said in the cadence of a job she trusts. \u201cWe tell the haircuts. We tell production. We keep copies of the copies in a place where water can\u2019t find them. We do not drink anything we didn\u2019t open with our own two hands for the foreseeable future, which is a shame because that girl at the caf\u00e9 makes a London Fog that could talk you into buying a house. We let him make his list if he wants to behave like a citizen instead of a dramatic person with a cap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a dramatic person with a cap,\u201d he said, and it made me want to laugh in a way that would have broken something if I\u2019d let it out too hard. \u201cI\u2019m also tired of being useless. I came to tell you to tell me to do something, and to ask you to forgive me for the days I was the problem when I thought I was the solution. I don\u2019t need you to pat my hand and I don\u2019t need to move in and fix your stair that squeaks. I need to be told where to stand and who to call if they come back and try to make you small.\u201d\n\nI stood because sitting makes me gentle and I did not want gentle for a second. I took the photograph, not because I wanted sage domesticity in a plastic frame but because I wanted my mother\u2019s mouth in the room when I said what I was going to say. I set it on the counter next to the hamper so the two moments that had tried to topple me these past days could look at each other and decide whether they were going to fight or flirt. \u201cStand where Jill tells you,\u201d I said. \u201cCall the number with not enough numbers and laugh into the phone and then hang up. Ask the waitress at the hotel what she needs to sleep well and deliver it to her in a way that doesn\u2019t make her think you expect her to thank you for witchcraft. Go to the yard and tell the men that if they know anyone who wears cedar who doesn\u2019t work at a tree farm, they should give you a name and you will do something useful with it. Do not come to the tent. If I look up and see you, I will forget to tell my hands to be kind.\u201d\n\nHe tipped his head in a way I had only ever seen him do outside when the geese flew in the wrong direction and he did not think much of their plan. \u201cFair,\u201d he said, and stood, and put his cap back on not like armor but like a signal. \u201cI\u2019ll go before I start saying something that will make you push me down the stairs. I\u2019ll leave the picture, if you will let me, and I\u2019ll pretend I was invited and I won\u2019t tell the men at the yard that I cried like an idiot when the gold fell on your head and I wasn\u2019t there to wipe it off your mouth like your mother would have with her sleeve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can tell them,\u201d Jill said, and he looked at her as if she had handed him a tool he hadn\u2019t known he needed. \u201cYou can tell anyone you want. You can tell the woman at the post office. You can tell the parts guy with the old hands. You can tell yourself when you get up to pee at three in the morning and you don\u2019t like the window because it feels like someone\u2019s watching. You can tell the truck.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and did a small half-turn that meant he was going to reach for me and then remembered I am not someone you reach for without being asked. We let him leave with the kind of silence that would have made our mother come into the room to break it, and when the door closed and the winter resumed being an honest animal, I picked up the photograph again and looked at the place where his hand held the pan with the pie without flinching. There is a lot to be said about grip, and what people think they are steadying when they put their fingers near your heat. Sometimes it\u2019s the thing. Sometimes it\u2019s themselves. Sometimes it\u2019s the space between you that neither of you wants to lose.\n\nWe cleaned after like people who have decided to call a room back from a version of itself they don\u2019t like. Jill took the bowls to the sink and made hot water sound like a decision. I folded the towel from her hair and put it on the back of the chair and told it not to fall off. The confetti we hadn\u2019t vacuumed yet glittered at the edge of the mat like the party that had learned to take a hint and leave the last of itself on the way out. When I went to put the photograph on the shelf near the cookbooks, a curl of paper slid from behind the frame and landed face down on the counter with the lazy, guilty flop of a fish that knows it has been seen. It was not the picture\u2019s backing. It was a receipt from the general store outside of town, stale bread and a bolt for something I don\u2019t own, two years old by the date, and on the back, in my mother\u2019s hand, the small grocery list handwriting that could fit a week of meals on a margin. It said sugar, and under it, not in the same hand, smaller, you. I touched the y with my finger and felt it rise.\n\nThe phone buzzed on the table like it had been politely waiting not to interrupt a family scene and had lost its manners. The number was blocked, which is a little theatrical for daylight, and I looked at Jill and she nodded, and I answered because I am done running from rings. The voice was a woman\u2019s, lower than I expected, the kind of careful you get when you make your living telling people how to stop their mouths from lying to them. She gave a first name and did not give a last, and my brain, the part that keeps files and smells and cross-references, rolled its drawers out and brought me the clipboard from the tent, the contact sheet with names circled twice, the wardrobe assistant with the velvet blazer and the tattoo of thyme on her wrist.\n\n\u201cI think he thought he was helping you,\u201d she said without preamble, and that he was he cracked open the room as efficiently as a crowbar. \u201cThe one with the cap. The wrong lanyard. He got it from us. Not on purpose, but because we gave the wrong person the right smile. He said he was family. He said he had something that would level the field. I gave him a pass because he said your name like he was trying it on a tooth. It is my job not to be tricked by the way people say things. He tricked me anyway. I am calling to say I am sorry. I am calling to say I quit.\u201d\n\nJill put her hand on the table, flat, like she was asking the wood to share its calm. I closed my eyes because sometimes you savor a voice better in darkness, and also because faces can make an apology feel heavier than it has to be. \u201cDid he say a name,\u201d I asked, keeping my voice where it can be kind and still ask for what it needs. \u201cDid he say why levelling a field involves juice. Did he say niece and misjudge the age of a demographic he doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018she thinks she won last year,\u2019\u201d the woman said, and the phrase arranged itself in my head with a thud. \u201cHe said, \u2018she should have sat down then and not gotten back up.\u2019 He said, \u2018make sure she doesn\u2019t get too much sugar before cameras,\u2019 which, now that I repeat it, is nothing but a sentence a person crafts when they think they are clever. He did not give a name I believe. He gave a smile my mother would have washed out with soap. He had a scar on his thumb that had closed in a way that says he does not let things heal correctly. I am telling you because I don\u2019t want you to think your fear is a story you invented to keep yourself interesting. It is ordinary. It has a face. We will find it again and make it be ordinary somewhere else.\u201d\n\nAfter we hung up, I wrote the word ordinary in my notebook because it is sometimes harder and braver than extraordinary and no one ever asks you to explain why you want it. I wrote call wardrobe, note apology, thumb scar, niece, level the field, and then I wrote sugar and under it, you, and then, in a different corner, I wrote remember, not as a command but as a verb that could be used for stitching. The house made its small night noises and the buns in the kitchen gave up their last warmth to the air. Outside, the snow had decided to be honest. The geese did not fly because there was nowhere to go that wasn\u2019t here.\n\nI went to bed with the photograph propped on the dresser where it could see me and I could see it without looking at it. The note that had travelled under my pillow for two days lived for a few hours in the drawer with socks because even talismans need to clock out. In the sleep that came, the tent was not a tent for once, but a room like my kitchen, and the judges came in without lights and with real faces and told me they were very tired of confetti and could we please try feathers once, and I said no because I am allergic, and they laughed the way people laugh when they have been awake for three days on purpose and are about to forgive the world for doing weather at them. In the middle of the night I woke not in panic but because the house had remembered something and needed to tell me. I lay there and let it, the pipes whispering their small codes, the hum of the fridge like the breath of an animal sleeping on the other side of the door, and I understood that the rest of the chapter would not be written by me alone, that there were other hands in it, some with scars, some with rings, some with thumbs with ink on them still. It did not make me less afraid. It made me capable of being afraid without inviting fear in for coffee.",

The house had a new gravity with the photograph propped on the dresser and the fake trophy on the counter and the envelope from the car stowed in a drawer I had to open twice before I trusted it to hold anything tender. Jill made oatmeal as if she had invented it and apologized to no one for the way she salted the pot. I took my coffee to the back step and watched a magpie bully the light out of a patch of snow until it decided to be water again, and the sight made me want to forgive every bird that has ever taken a shine to what wasn\u2019t theirs. When Jill joined me, she brought a blanket and spread it over our knees like we were old women doing the kind of gossip that keeps small towns alive, and we didn\u2019t talk because silence felt like a clean plate between us. The note from wardrobe had not burned a hole in my pocket, which impressed me; an apology that didn\u2019t ask for absolution had the courtesy to sit quietly and wait its turn. The neurologist\u2019s tea still lived in my mouth like a good ghost, and the word ordinary kept drifting through my head in a way that made me think of men who never learned to make their beds and of women who did and weren\u2019t thanked.\n\nWe did the kind of cleaning you do when you\u2019ve had visitors you didn\u2019t plan for, collecting the stubborn confetti with tape and a practiced flick because brooms simply spread chaos around with a better attitude. The hamper had a way of attracting fingerprints every time I passed it, which felt like a joke and also like a reminder not to curate my own past into something that couldn\u2019t be smudged. When I put the measuring spoons into the drawer with the ones that had belonged to my mother, they made a sound that could have been an argument or could have been a greeting, and I chose greeting because the world is easier when people are meeting each other for the first time and not relitigating old chores. Jill took a call from production and her voice did its I am being reasonable song while she said words like chain of custody and hotel security and we do not consent to spin. When she hung up, she pressed the heel of her hand to her forehead and said the word optics like someone who knows what it costs to be photographed without wanting to be a photo. I said we could turn our phones face down for a while and she smiled like I\u2019d remembered our language.\n\nAnika called at ten after eleven, and the name on the screen made my breath behave like a rabbit under a porch. I answered in the tone you use for people you have missed without admitting you were missing them, which was rude because I hadn\u2019t earned missing her yet. Her voice was lower than the clips, warmer, with a kindness she wasn\u2019t performing for anyone\u2019s arc. She didn\u2019t tell me she\u2019d come to the hospital; she didn\u2019t have to because Jill had put the sash on that story, but her first sentence made the room wider. She said, \u201cI made the same dome again last night because my hands were missing the noise,\u201d and I laughed because it was a silly thing to do and exactly the kind of thing I understood. We talked about sugar like gossip and about decoy endings like weather, and she told me her father had framed a newspaper page and put it in the bedroom even though her mother said it was weird, and then her mother cried again when the cat knocked it down and chipped the glass.\n\nWhen she asked if the lavender had arrived, I told her about the card tucked in the hamper and the sprig that had stained the tissue in a vein, and her breath caught in a way that made distance smaller. She said it wasn\u2019t hers, that she had thought about sending something but stopped because the letter from production had been written in a voice that told people how to be careful, and she is very good at doing as she\u2019s told until she isn\u2019t. Someone at craft has a teenage daughter who thinks the tent is a church, she said, and I told her about the producer\u2019s kid, and we marveled briefly at how the children were getting the point while the adults were busy doing paperwork. When she asked if I had watched last year yet, I told her no because I wanted the confetti in my head to be mine a little longer, and she said that was fair even though she had the right to put a hand on my shoulder and tell me to look. Before we hung up, she said, \u201cIf you want to come east when the roads are sure of themselves, I have a spare bed and a drawer you can put your notebook in,\u201d and I wrote the city name down with a circle around it in a part of the page that looked like an invitation.\n\nWe drove out to the general store from the receipt because I have learned to follow the small threads that present themselves without pretending I am above string. The road was the kind that makes winter look like a habit, ruts in all the same places, a stubborn stand of trees that huddled like conspirators and then got distracted by the sun. The store\u2019s bell did its ceremonial clang when we went in, and the air had the smell of rubber boots and cinnamon-scented brooms and stale sugar that has made peace with its fate. The clerk had a face like someone who could convince you to buy a jar of pickled something and then put the money back in your pocket while you were distracted by a puppy. When we showed her the receipt and asked if she recognized the handwriting on the back, she tilted her head with the care of a person who doesn\u2019t traffic in certainty unless she has to. She said the bolt was probably for a gate that will hang wrong anyway and the bread was the day-old that only people with good teeth buy. She said three men come in smelling like cedar and none of them look like they sleep well, and all three have scars because life here is generous with them.\n\nOn the corkboard near the coffee machine was an ad for the same \u201cAffordable. Discreet.\u201d service that had been circled on the clipping in my car, but here it was complete, a phone number that rolled off the tongue as if someone had chosen it while thinking about late-night radio. The name was Blue Heron Retrievals, which made me want to smile because herons do not retrieve so much as stand very still and let the world forget they are there until they strike. When I called, a voice mail informed me I had reached a service that finds what other people misplace, and the beep that followed was the sound of an invitation to be foolish. I didn\u2019t leave a message because even people who tell the truth for a living sometimes know to keep a story in their pocket until it ripens. Jill wrote the number down and the clerk slid us a small bag of caramels with a wink as if to say, here, have a useful lie to practice on.\n\nAt home, the day lay down like a dog finally convinced we weren\u2019t going anywhere. I made soup because even glory gets tired and wants to sit with broth, and Jill pretended to do paperwork while keeping an eye on the driveway like it held a secret she was ready to be bored by. The father-shaped silence in the house wasn\u2019t leaden; it was the quiet you get after weather hits and the sky remembers it has other jobs. Around three the light did that thing where it turns the edges of things honest and you can see how corners are really round, and I took down my grandmother\u2019s apron and put it on even though I wasn\u2019t baking. The fabric has faded in a way that tells you where the work was done and where it was mostly for show, and the strings remembered the knot before I did.\n\nWe did not plan a watch party because the thought of people watching my face while I watched my face made me feel like a cat asked to look in a mirror. The caf\u00e9 offered to put the episode on a screen for anyone who wanted to clap at appropriate times and be discreet about their tears, because Green Hair knows how feelings behave when there is steamed milk involved. We said later, and she texted Jill, traitor, with a string of knife and heart emojis that somehow read as affection. Instead, when the hour rolled around, we sat on the couch and turned the volume down until the judges\u2019 voices sounded like other people\u2019s parents in the next room arguing about pie. The opening montage did its usual tricks and somehow found footage of me tying my apron as if I were putting on a cape, which told me production had learned me efficiently.\n\nThe edit was kind but not soft, which is to say they let me have mistakes without putting balloons around them. They showed my hands on the dough and my smile doing that thing it does when I\u2019m inside an idea and only remember at the very end that other people exist. They didn\u2019t mention last year with anything more than a raised eyebrow and a line about d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, which was merciful, and when they got to the orange juice they did not get to the orange juice because cameras had not been there. The producers were good at making absence look like choice, which is a skill I wish nobody needed. When the judges called my name near the end, the part of me that had been braced for a blow let go of the doorframe and came into the room. Gold paper rained out of the TV with the decorum of confetti that knows it is not biodegradable, and the sound it made when it hit the floor in my living room was nothing, because of course it couldn\u2019t travel, and that felt exactly right.\n\nMy phone ticked with messages like a patient monitor with a sense of humor. Some were from people who had borrowed sugar from me and regretted giving it back; some were from names I recognized with the same feeling you get of seeing your own town under snow and remembering where the sidewalks are. There was one from a publisher whose logo looks like a bird deciding whether or not to migrate this year, and the subject line said, Your voice is hungry, which made me laugh because it was a dumb line and also because it wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t open it because I wanted to sit in the unmarketable version of my life for a few more hours, the one where my sister complained that confetti was going to clog the vacuum and I argued that glitter has rights.\n\nWhen the credits rolled, I turned the sound up so we could hear the part where they list the departments and the names of the people whose hands I have memorized before their faces. The wardrobe assistant\u2019s name was there, solid and unadorned, and I hoped her resignation would be the kind where she left with her dignity packed carefully between two sweaters and not the kind where someone put her keys on a hook and closed the door too fast. The medic got a shout-out, which is not usual, and I suspected someone in post was making a case for bodies behaving strangely under lights. The craft services team earned a heart in my notebook because they always do, and I wrote their names down like a charm.\n\nAfter, the house exhaled like it had been listening through the walls. Jill set the plates in the sink and didn\u2019t wash them, which is how I knew she was tired because she washes to think and she dries to punish herself for washing. We both watched the window because our father has always announced his return by leaning on the horn as if he were starring in a parade, but he did not lean, he did not knock, and I chose to be grateful instead of suspicious. I was putting the kettle on when my phone vibrated again with a number I didn\u2019t recognize, and the little dog in the back of my head, the one that has to decide whether to bark at every rustle, lifted its head but didn\u2019t bark.\n\nIt was a man\u2019s voice, not the cap\u2019s, careful the way people get when they\u2019re trying to undo a mistake with tone. He said his name as if it should mean something and it didn\u2019t, and then he put words together with the same anxiety I use when I\u2019m trying to fold in whipped cream without losing volume. He said he had been the one to hire Blue Heron Retrievals for a task last year that was not recovered property but rather recovered dignity, and he had given them the show\u2019s filming schedule and a roster without intending harm. He said he had thought he was protecting an investment, which he was embarrassed to hear himself say out loud because it made him sound like a person who didn\u2019t know the difference between a pastry and a paycheck. He worked for a sponsor, he admitted, the maple syrup in the pretty bottle with the leaf like a vain hand, and his boss had liked the idea that last year\u2019s drama could sell this year\u2019s sweetness.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say sabotage because men like that never do; he said nudge and optics and keep everybody honest. He stumbled over the part where he was eager to make sure I didn\u2019t tell a story that didn\u2019t flatter their brand, and then, to his credit, he stopped and backed up and said, \u201cI am hearing myself and I am appalled,\u201d and that made his voice more useful to me. He didn\u2019t know about the juice. He didn\u2019t know about the note. He knew about the cap, he said finally, and he knew the name that went with the thumb, and he said it the way people say names when they\u2019ve had to learn them on paper first. It wasn\u2019t Walt, or Hank, or any of the men who sit on stools in our town and talk about weather like they invented it. It was the name of a runner in Calgary who moved equipment for shows and had worked too many productions with too little sleep and had a habit of solving problems nobody asked him to solve.\n\nAfter we hung up, I took the name out to the garage because I wanted to see how it looked next to the dent in the drywall and the stripe of oil that keeps its own calendar. I said it out loud to let it bounce off the tool bench and see if anything fell out of the air that I could use. Jill joined me with two mugs and handed me one like we were in a play about forgiveness. She asked if the name felt like anything and I said it felt like a man who thinks every woman in a room is both a department and a solution. She nodded like that was a taste she\u2019d encountered before and then put the mug down and picked up the fake trophy and set it on the shelf next to the photograph in the same movement with no ceremony at all, and the lack of ceremony made my eyes do the wet thing and then not.\n\nWe slept that night as if sleep were a job and we were trying to impress a supervisor. The house made the soft adjustments houses make when they\u2019ve decided they are on your side, and I woke once with the old startle and then remembered that I had told my brain it could be scared without inviting fear to put its boots on the bedspread. In the morning, I went for a walk in Waskasoo with my hands in my pockets and my eyes on the part of the path where dogs write their stories for each other, and I let the cold rearrange the parts of me that like drama and ask them to sit quietly. A man with a navy cap ran past me going the other direction and didn\u2019t look at me at all, and the tiny theater in my chest that had been rehearsing the scene where I met the villain without my eyeliner called a halt and sent everyone home because they needed rest.\n\nBack at the house, the mail had been pushed through the slot with an enthusiasm that made me worry about our postal worker\u2019s hands. Among the flyers and the glossy lies about furniture there was a heavy envelope with my pen name written in a hand I recognized only because I had seen it on the label of a jar of pickles at the farmer\u2019s market. Inside was a letter that did not attempt poetry. It was from the woman who sells chokecherry jam in a stall near the entrance, the one who wears the same apron my grandmother had but jollier. She said she had watched the show and yelled at the television and then apologized to her husband and then yelled again, and she wanted me to know that if I needed chokecherries she had two freezer bags labelled by month and moon phase. She said her sister had once forgotten a whole season and had remembered it again because someone baked a pie that tasted exactly like the day the power went out and everyone in the street had come outside and learned each other\u2019s names. She said, \u201cYou do not owe anybody an explanation for why you had to do the same brave thing twice.\u201d\n\nJill brought in the paper and rolled her eyes at the editorial about how television had made people forget how to be decent at four-way stops. She made a list on the back for me because lists calm her and because today\u2019s tasks were not imaginary for once. Call the sponsor whose maples were ashamed. Call the wardrobe assistant back and ask what she\u2019s doing next, because good people need jobs they didn\u2019t plan, and this was what we could do about that. Meet our father at the caf\u00e9 because he had texted, three words that would have made me laugh if they hadn\u2019t made my stomach behave like something under the stove. He had sent, behave yourself please, and then had the sense to follow it with, that\u2019s for me, not you.\n\nWe went because the thing about being from a place is that you show up when the person who made you complicated asks you politely not to make them worse. The caf\u00e9 was warmer than it needed to be and Green Hair slid us our drinks without payment and then turned her back in a practiced way that tells you she knows when not to collect the story. Our father was already at a table with his cap rolled in his hands and his jacket hung on the back of the chair like a man he was trying to keep from leaving. He looked better than he had the night before and worse, which is to say he had slept just the amount you sleep when your brain is arguing with your pride. He stood because his mother raised him with a long wooden spoon and he has the marks to prove it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t waste words on compliments or on how television makes people look different. He had a printout in his hand, which was new and frightening because printers intimidate him, and he slid it across to Jill with careful fingers. It was a page from a staffing agency\u2019s website with faces that you\u2019d forget unless you had a reason not to, and one of them had a thumb visible because of the way he held a wrench in a posed way that looked natural if you\u2019d never seen how real hands behave around tools. The scar was there, a pale line that said the man had been careless with something sharp once and had learned only enough to get by. The name under the picture was the one from the sponsor\u2019s call, which made me grateful for the small evil of corporate efficiency.\n\n\u201cI went to the yard at sunup and asked the boys if they knew him,\u201d my father said, and his voice had the satisfaction of a person who has allowed the morning air into parts he usually keeps closed. \u201cTwo did. One of them owed him fifty bucks and the other had a cousin who said he\u2019ll do anything twice if the first time pays. He works under a foreman who doesn\u2019t know how to say no and above a kid who needs to. He likes to be where the noise is.\u201d He glanced at me then, and I felt the part of him that could have tried to use this as a ribbon, a way to tie us into a story where he was the hero, take the leash off and let it run around the block once before it came back and sat. \u201cYou give this to your haircuts,\u201d he said, using Jill\u2019s term like a man who knows when to steal. \u201cYou tell them I\u2019m not messy like I used to be. You tell them to keep their hands clean while they shake the tree.\u201d\n\nWe called the officers, and the older one\u2019s pleased hum came through the line in a way that told me he had been hoping his day would have shape and now it did. He asked us to email the link and the screenshot and the notes from the sponsor and the log of calls, and Jill did it while giving the computer the side-eye the way you give a neighbor\u2019s dog permission to lick you because it insists. I texted the wardrobe assistant to tell her about the name and the thumb and to ask if she wanted to meet us for a coffee where no one was filming, and she replied with a heart and a knife, which is our new family crest, and said maybe later, because today she was packing a box in a room that had too many mirrors.\n\nIn the afternoon, when the light turned that color that makes me think of the first cups of tea poured by women who have survived babies and men and their own bodies, I set dough to rise because the house needed to see my hands make something that wasn\u2019t defense. I made bread that doesn\u2019t like to be rushed and I didn\u2019t rush it; I wrapped the bowl with the towel my aunt embroidered and told it I trusted it to do what it had promised. Jill answered three calls from women she had sat on curbs with in bare feet at three in the morning while gasoline thought about being a fire, and she used the voice that tells people they\u2019ve already done the brave part and all that\u2019s left is the paperwork. Our father texted again, three words that were worse than the last three because they were better. He said, proud of you, without a period, and I sat down hard on the floor and let the bread rise above me like a cloud.\n\nTowards evening, a car I didn\u2019t recognize pulled up and stopped the way careful drivers do when they arrive in a neighborhood where they have not earned the right to drive badly. A woman with a coat that belonged to a different city got out and stood on the sidewalk looking at our house as if she were trying to decide what kind of door her knock would be. I stepped onto the porch and waited because I\u2019ve learned to let other people define the scene when they bring their own weather to my steps. She had hair that said she went to bed with it wet and hoped for the best and a scar along her jaw like someone had once explained to her that winter is unfair and she had agreed. She introduced herself as the legal person for the sponsor with the leaf, but her voice didn\u2019t sound legal; it sounded like someone who has had to learn the trick of making her mouth say money when her brain is writing brief histories of all the rooms she\u2019s in.\n\nShe apologized in a way that included the building she works in without making it a shield, and she said she had brought a letter that said they were withdrawing from any activities that look like nudging people without their consent. She said she had a aunt in Waskasoo and this street used to be her route on a bicycle that was too big for her and she had the scars on her shins to prove it. She asked if I wanted her to take back the pretty bottle with the vein of syrup that had been in the hamper, and I told her it could stay because I am trying to learn the difference between the object and the person it reminds me of. Before she left, she said the name of the man with the thumb without being asked, and I believed her more than I believed anyone attached to a budget in weeks, which is not the same thing as trust and will have to do.\n\nWe ate bread with soup and there was butter involved and the house pretended not to notice how grateful I was to be allowed this. Jill wiped the table with the concentration she saves for when she is waiting for a text that will tell her a person she loves has survived something and can be told a joke. The text arrived, not from a person we know, but from the production number we have saved as the word tent, and it said that he had been let go from his freelance contract pending an investigation, and that they were very sorry to have introduced a man with a hero complex to a room where sugar worked just fine without him. I didn\u2019t want to feel glee because I have been on the losing end of other people\u2019s justice before, but I let myself enjoy the way the sentence had been written without consulting a lawyer first.\n\nNight made its case again and I agreed to it. Before I went to bed, I stood in the garage and touched the dent in the drywall because it is rude to visit a place that has held a memory and not acknowledge its work. I looked at the photograph and the plastic trophy making a temporary peace on the shelf and the ridiculous sprig of lavender that had refused to die on its way here, and I said the word remember in the casual way you would ask someone to pass you the salt. In bed, I wrote a paragraph in the green notebook I knew would make the bird publisher call again and I did it anyway. I wrote that the thing about heat is that it makes everything honest, and that sugar is only a liar if you expect it to behave like salt, and that people who think confetti is decoration have never had it in their mouths when they were trying to say thank you. Then I turned off the light and slept because I could, and because I have learned that practicing joy is the only rehearsal that matters when the curtain goes up again and you are asked, once more, to carry something that could shatter and decide not to.",
