     "novel_text": "By the time the night custodians finished the east wing of the office tower and the first blue smear of morning fingered the river, Rory Grady could feel bleach in the creases of his knuckles like a second pulse. Cincinnati was still mostly asleep, a few trucks humming west on the Brent Spence, river fog bruised by sodium lights. He pushed his cart past rows of empty cubicles and screensaver nebulae, picking up confetti from last night\u2019s sales celebration, a champagne cork that had rolled behind a ficus with desperate, childhood determination. He should have had music in his ear\u2014Dee always told him to use a playlist and zone out\u2014but he preferred the creak and squeak of his wheels and the occasional thump-thump of a tired man trying to buckle the city back together before the bankers returned.\n\nAt the north windows, he paused and watched the Ohio slide like a long thought beneath the Roebling Bridge, those tidy pale ropes running up to the sky. Across the water, Covington had a handful of lights glowing in kitchen windows. He imagined a few early risers whisking eggs and working batter into silky spirals. It made the hunger in his chest ache. Not for food, not precisely. For a mixing bowl the size of a child, for the heavy comfort of a measured cup leveling off with the back of a knife, for the whisper of flour.\n\nHe had learned flour under his Nana\u2019s kitchen lamp, the one with the stained glass shade in amber and claret. Mix until it looks like the inside of a cloud, Nana would say, and then, more sternly, Leave it alone. Don\u2019t fuss it to death. If he stood very still now, he could hear the wooden drawers sliding open to reveal scuffed cups and spoons, could smell butter and something deeper\u2014nutmeg maybe, or the piney cut of black walnut\u2014which was Ohio in a bowl. At twelve, when other boys were making paper airplanes out of math worksheets or learning to cuss properly, he was sifting. It embarrassed him then. Now it saved him.\n\nHe dumped a trash bag into the bin and tied it with a quick twist, his fingers moving in the small, deft way they had when he crimped a pie. Stickers on the bin read Team Queen City Clean and had peeling corners that he smoothed reflexively each morning. He wheeled the cart around a desk where someone had left a memo face-up, and there was the word budget like a red kite yanked by wind, followed by numbers, numbers, numbers that meant nothing to him. This world was glossy. He came in after-hours to scrub away the smudges that daytime left. His world was stainless steel bowls and secondhand ovens and eggs that, when cracked, sometimes surprised him with a double yolk as if the morning had whispered, Try again, Rory. Try one more.\n\n\u201cStop staring at the river and finish the twelfth floor before the sun fries your skin. You Irish boys catch light like paper. You ever notice that?\u201d Dee\u2019s voice was a generous rasp. She had been a nurse once\u2014this surprised people until she told them the story of the hospital that swallowed twelve years of her life and spit her out when her back pulled and she forgot a code. Coffee sloshed in her travel mug with a little hiss each time she rolled her own cart. \u201cI mean it, Grady. You\u2019ve got batter in your brain.\u201d\n\nHe grinned and kept mopping. \u201cBatter is where the answers live.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe answer is: quit wiping with that limp wrist. Put muscle in it so I don\u2019t have to redo your streaks. I already redid your streaks last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was insulted.\u201d\n\nThey moved like that through the morning\u2014through carpet and tile, cubicles and glass. Across the hall from the Board Room, Rory flicked the mop one last time and glanced at his phone not because he expected anything but because a habit is a superstition in overalls. His home screen was a photo he\u2019d seen tucked in a cookery book once: a black-and-white of hands dusted with flour, the knuckles and heel of the palms smudged into a storm. No new calls. A promotional email from a chain bakery offering him a doughnut in exchange for a pound of his personal data. An alert about the weather: bright, wind later. Then, a subject line that made his mouth go desert-dry.\n\nCrown & Crust Finalist\u2014Availability Confirmation.\n\nHe touched it and the screen refused to respond; his thumb was damp and the phone seemed to step back, shy. He wiped his hands on his pants, even though they were as clean as they were going to get, and tried again. The email bloomed open like a flower.\n\nWe are pleased to inform you, it began. Due to unforeseen circumstances, a finalist slot has opened up for Crown & Crust. After reviewing your audition portfolio and preliminary performances, we would like to invite you to compete in the live final at Cincinnati Music Hall. Please confirm your availability by\u2014\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pass out. The floor is clean here and hate to dirty it with you.\u201d Dee had come up behind him and could read upside down like a bat. \u201cLet me guess. You won a Caribbean cruise. Or we both did. It\u2019s a timeshare, honey. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d Rory said, and heard his own voice as if it were someone else\u2019s\u2014light and floating, not clipped and tired like usual.\n\nDee took the phone with hands that were slow and capable and smelled faintly of lemon oil. She read the email twice. \u201cOh, come on now. After all the times you told me those producers forgot you existed. You told me that with drama, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did forget me. They forgot me six times.\u201d He could feel his smile trying to climb his face, and he let it. \u201cThis is\u2014this is crazy, Dee. This is a glitch. They pulled my name by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing your what-now? After reviewing your you-beatten eggs, they said. The colored lights want you. That\u2019s what it says. Confirm your availably by noon, weirdo. Noon,\u201d she repeated, as though he might mistake it for autumn. \u201cCall them. Before the world bends back and snaps shut.\u201d\n\nHe called, fumbling with speaker and then not, hearing his own breath on the line and the little desktop waterfall in the manager\u2019s office behind them trickling like scripted serenity. A woman answered in the crisp voice of someone whose job it was to keep moving before the enthusiasm of amateur bakers could catch her and drag her into a chat about meringue.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Grady. We had a finalist fall ill, and your name is at the top of our list. Your preliminary round pies were remarkable. The texture on that rye croissant you brought the camera crew\u2014I still think about the structure. And the thing with the black walnut and honey. You\u2019re local, and we love when locals take the stage at Music Hall. It makes the crowd happier.\u201d Always the crowd, thought Rory. Always the swell of them, arranged like a mouth.\n\n\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d he said, because the boy inside him, the one with the Nana lamp throwing patchy light on his homework, did not believe good news had weight. Good news lived in clouds. It would blow away the second he reached for it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sure. Can you be at the technical walkthrough Wednesday afternoon? Production needs to measure your bench height, make sure you can reach the ovens comfortably, things like that. Ms. Vale would like to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u201cCassidy Vale? I mean\u2014yes. Yes, I can. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\n\nHe hung up and Dee set her palm between his shoulders and leaned in with the measured pressure she kept for people who were coughing or confessing. \u201cWell, if that isn\u2019t a kick in the heart. Look at you. Look at your eyes going bright. I wish I\u2019d brought a camera. You\u2019re gonna make the city proud, even if you trip and drop a whole anythings on live television. You\u2019ll be charming. You are. You\u2019re a mess, but you\u2019re charming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to faint in front of Cassidy Vale, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d He felt giddy the way he had once, on a rollercoaster when he was seventeen, riding with Lena and screaming until the scream broke into laughter and the laughter into tears. He could see it laid out like a pastry case: a crowd, lights, ovens humming like lions in cages, the host\u2019s smile white and the sort of white that you think of later when your kitchen window goes cloudy at dawn. He could almost hear the whisk against metal that said, move, move, a show is not a kitchen; a show is speed; a show is a story you tell with butter.\n\nHe texted Lena in Covington. His thumbs slicked and stumbled. guess who just got a slot on crown + crust? he typed, and then added too many exclamation points and deleted two, left one, added two more. A black storm of dots appeared as she typed back.\n\nAs in the tv show? As in the thing you made us all sit perfectly still for six Sunday nights in a row last summer? As in you are going to faint on live television and make me change my last name? Proud of you, stupid.\n\nHe grinned so hard his cheeks hurt. \u201cI have to practice,\u201d he said to Dee. \u201cI have two days and my oven runs hot and the weather\u2019s weird and my hands are shaky and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to finish the eleventh floor so we can clock out and get you home. Then you can burn that tiny apartment down with caramel. Practice is nothing if your landlord throws you into the street.\u201d\n\nWhen they finished the last office, pulled the carts back into the supply closet, and filled the bucket with clean water to soak the mops, Rory took an extra half-second to run a cloth along the shelf\u2019s edge. It felt like placating some complicated god. You do what you do. You make a surface gleam. You make space.\n\nHe walked home in the brightening. Sixth Street had a few cars and the sweet smell of something sugary rising from a bakery two blocks over. It wasn\u2019t much of a bakery; the sort that warmed frozen croissants and told commuters they were fresh out of the oven. Still, the scent wrapped itself around him and teased. He cut over toward Over-the-Rhine and let himself in at his building, past the ferns Mrs. Kline had arranged in plastic urns on the bannister, past the paper flier advertising a lost parakeet\u2014small, green, answers to the name of Bean, if found please do not yell\u2014and up the worn stairs to his floor.\n\nMrs. Kline poked her head out as if his footsteps had rung a bell. She had the look of someone who\u2019d thrown her hair into a bun in 1973 and never taken it down again. \u201cMorning, Rory,\u201d she said. \u201cYou smell like lemon and something else. Glue?\u201d\n\n\u201cVictory,\u201d he said, and leaned on the railing. \u201cMaybe victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve won the lottery, I\u2019m switching out your locks and raising the rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019ve won the lottery, I\u2019ll buy you a door that doesn\u2019t stick every time the humidity changes.\u201d He liked her because she could be mean at a moment\u2019s notice, and that sort of meanness was almost always worry. \u201cI\u2019m in a baking competition. The final. Music Hall.\u201d\n\nHer lips parted. \u201cOh! Well. Aren\u2019t you a\u2014aren\u2019t you something.\u201d She swatted at the air like compliments were wasps. \u201cYou\u2019re always bringing me those scone things. What are they called. Scones. You brought me scones. You want me to watch?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you watch, the stage will catch fire. That\u2019s a proven thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make jokes or else the evil eye\u2019ll take you. Pickles, no! Get down!\u201d The cat had slipped past her ankles to eye Rory\u2019s shoelaces like prey. Pickles was fat and orange and wore a bell that turned him into a fleet of sleighs when he ran. He had a contrarian soul, also a grudge against mops.\n\n\u201cPickles,\u201d Rory said in his diplomatic voice. \u201cWe are friendly. We don\u2019t scratch. We coexist.\u201d\n\nPickles flicked his tail as if that settled it. He swiped at Rory\u2019s lace and then rubbed his head against Rory\u2019s calf with a sudden violence that was almost tender. Something like the hush before a storm. Pickles\u2019 pupils were wide, a pair of black olives in a soup.\n\n\u201cHe woke me at three by trying to suffocate me,\u201d Mrs. Kline said. \u201cHe\u2019s been restless. It\u2019s the weather. It\u2019s the neighborhood. It\u2019s television damaging our pets. It\u2019s\u2014go to bed, Rory. I\u2019m arguing because it\u2019s Tuesday.\u201d\n\nHe unlocked his door and stood for a second in the little square of his kitchen. The place had been a studio once, before a landlord with practical dreams carved it into two smaller rectangles. His couch had a sag where he slept sometimes; the bed was narrow and patient; the sink had a particular way of complaining when he ran hot water too long. He set his phone on the table, poured a glass of tap water, and plucked the magnet from the fridge that held Nana\u2019s recipe for pecan flips. He had a sheet of black walnuts in a paper bag in the cupboard, cracked last month by a woman at Findlay Market in exchange for three little jam tarts. He pulled the bag out and inhaled the scent: sharp, thick, almost medicinal in the way of loves that have saved your life more than once.\n\nOn the shelf above the stove, a framed photo of him and Nana leaned against the wall. It had been taken at her kitchen table, which was too close to the oven, a hazard he didn\u2019t understand until he was older and fussed over heat distribution. They were both holding their hands up as if they were swearing to tell the truth. Their palms were white as if they\u2019d been trying to disappear. Nana always told him to do the thing that was in his hands, the thing that sat in the palm like a bird. Don\u2019t get fancy, Augie, she\u2019d say sometimes, calling him that old family nickname he pretended to hate. Flour and butter, sugar and eggs. The basics. And when the heaven television calls, you answer. You don\u2019t put them on hold. That part she\u2019d added more recently in his imagination, because she died when he was nineteen and there was no television then that cared about the way his wrist flicked when he whisked.\n\nHe napped for two hours in his narrow bed with the shade half down, the line of light across his feet moving softly as if not to wake him. The dream he had was a bakery dream: egg whites that refused to peak no matter how he whispered to them, bowls that slipped sideways and ran away, an oven door that led to a street and then to the river, which steamed like soup. He woke with a dry mouth and an idea pinwheeling. Honey walnut cake with a rye crumb. Lemon curd on one tier but not in the usual way. Something like that. Something Ohio and a little bit immigrant and a little bit old lady and a little bit television.\n\nHe set bowls on the counter, lined them up like reliquaries, cracked eggs, separated yolks, watched the whites slide away clean. He always let himself be proud of that little neat act. The first tablespoon of sugar rained into the yolks like news. He stirred and the angle of his elbow was his father\u2019s, the only thing he had gotten good from the man. He ran the mixer and the sound softened something else inside him, a knot that always wrapped around the morning. He cut butter into flour and the fat mapped itself into flakes the size of small coins. He threw a slack dish towel over the bowl and let it sit, let it breathe and think.\n\nAt noon he went down to the corner and bought himself good honey from a woman who kept bees and wore outrageously wide-brimmed hats. \u201cYou\u2019re a baker,\u201d she said, thrusting a jar at him like a weapon. \u201cI remember faces that come back because they tasted something true. If you put this in a cake, I will come to your house to get a piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on television,\u201d he said impulsively, only because he had not yet said it to a stranger and wanted to see how those words looked out in the open air. \u201cThe final. Music Hall.\u201d\n\nShe took his hand in both of hers. \u201cBless. Better not mess it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI intend to be slightly underwhelming and then maybe we\u2019ll all be pleasantly surprised,\u201d he said, and she laughed, and the laugh went up into the hat like gold.\n\nOn the way home, he paused outside the caf\u00e9 where Sammi worked and looked at the chalkboard that announced their new almond milk like it was a revolution. Sammi spotted him and waved him in. He tapped the glass for once, breaking his own rule about only tapping glass in aquariums.\n\n\u201cYou look like you swallowed a light bulb,\u201d Sammi called, pulling espresso with an elegant efficiency that made him jealous even though espresso was a facile trick and pastry was slow love. \u201cWhat happened? Did Dee finally propose? I told her she would. Honestly, she\u2019s been playing the long game.\u201d\n\nHe told him. Sammi screamed in a way that made the customers turn and smile and one man frown as if he had been cheated. Sammi came around the counter to squeeze his shoulders. \u201cAbout time. Sometimes the world almost resembles justice. Do you need espresso? Or would that make you too crazed and then you\u2019d go home and explode butter from the cabinets.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne shot. Make it kind. I have to practice piping.\u201d\n\nSammi set the cup in front of him and then folded his arms and leaned on the counter like an aunt. \u201cAnd after you win? Will you leave me for a nicer coffee shop with marble counters and people who wear crisp aprons for fun?\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter I win,\u201d Rory said, testing the shape of the words in his mouth like a new pastry tip, \u201cI\u2019ll come here and buy a round for the house and then I\u2019ll go home and I\u2019ll bake the biggest cake you\u2019ve ever seen and I\u2019ll eat it on my floor with a fork.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t eat a victory cake alone. I\u2019ll come with plates. Bring paper. You know you hate dishes when you\u2019re emotional.\u201d\n\nHe went home with the espresso warmth lingering, like a friend who didn\u2019t leave even when you pushed back your chair. He rolled dough smooth, folded it like a letter, rolled it again. He piped tiny peaks on shortbreads and then swiped them off because the peaks were smug. He baked a failed chiffon just for the pleasure of tasting the failure and biting into the particular resilience of egg and sugar when they decide to resist your charms. He kept his phone face-down on the table so he wouldn\u2019t see the minutes. Whenever it buzzed, he jumped, convinced it would be an email recanting the invitation or a text from Lena that read JK.\n\nThe walk-through took place in a world that had been assembled and polished and snapped into place since the last time he\u2019d seen it. Music Hall in the afternoon was dark and wide like a hand. Crew in black tee shirts rolled carts. A camera on a crane swung overhead as slowly and ominously as a planet. He stood on the stage with a name placard\u2014GRADY, R.\u2014a bank of ovens behind his station like patient warm fellows, like heavy animals at rest. The bench was actually a touch too low and he said so and someone came with shims and slid them under the legs as if they were slipping money into a birthday card.\n\n\u201cRory Grady,\u201d said a voice behind him, and he turned to see Cassidy Vale with her human brightness turned down to a simmer. In person she was smaller, her teeth no less white, her laugh contained for now because there was no audience to take it and multiply it by ten. She shook his hand. \u201cSo you\u2019re the hometown story. Thank God. If I had to pretend to love another pretty Californian this week, I\u2019d have quit and gone to sell muffins from a truck.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cI love Californians.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t. And if you do, pretend otherwise. I read your file. Custodian. We love that. Television loves that. Are you ready to be edited into a composite of hardworking, humble grit with a dash of Nana?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Nana would love to be edited into anything. She would haunt you if you didn\u2019t mention her.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Cassidy said, and her eyes had the glint of a person who could catch two balls while you threw a third. \u201cWe\u2019re on live delay but not long enough to save you if you swear. Don\u2019t swear. Don\u2019t set the station on fire. If you cry, do it in a way that makes our camera stay on your eyes. If you need anything, yell my name on the side with the golden recorder, not the side with the hot mic.\u201d\n\nShe moved on and he touched the counter, then touched it again. The people around him were a comfortable blur: stage managers, lighting technicians carrying their ladders like friendly giraffes, and three other bakers in street clothes who eyed him with open curiosity and a little territorial defensiveness.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d said one of them, a woman with hair that looked like she had rolled out of a nap on a lawn and freckles that had fallen on her nose like ash. \u201cYou the local kid they hauled out of some broom closet? I\u2019m Penelope Hart. I do the bread cart at the German restaurant. My sourdough starter is older than my resentment.\u201d\n\n\u201cRory,\u201d he said. \u201cCustodial engineer.\u201d\n\nShe snorted. \u201cNice to meet you, future rival-slash-ally. That\u2019s Jace with the hat and Abby with the earlobe thing. Abby\u2019s pastry cream makes you forget your mother\u2019s name for two hours, minimum. Congratulations on sneaking in at the end.\u201d\n\nHe liked the way she said it. As if he had run in right before a closing door and no one could be mad because the door had left that last inch as a dare. He shook hands with the others. When they all moved to check their stations, he stood alone for a moment and looked out into the yawning dark where the crowd would be. He thought of Mrs. Kline in her apartment with the cat on her lap, rolling his eyes at the way she yelled at the television. He thought of Lena on her couch, knees up, a beer sweating into her palm. He thought of Dee standing in a clean hallway at four a.m. next week and telling a plant, because no one else was there to hear, that she knew him first.\n\nThe stage door swung open then and light poured in, and something low to the floor streaked in like a rumor. A stagehand laughed and snapped his fingers. \u201cHow do you keep getting in here, man? Out. Back out.\u201d The thing paused in the middle of the stage and Rory made out a cat the color of brick, its tail like a question mark. It stared at him with that stare cats have that says they have already judged you and found you deficient.\n\n\u201cStage cat,\u201d Penelope said from behind him. \u201cName\u2019s Smee. He hates equipment cases and also most men. If you give him salmon, he\u2019ll remember you in his will and leave you at least a chunk of the lighting grid.\u201d\n\nSmee trotted toward the wings, then stopped, as if reconsidering, and flopped onto his side under the table with the mixing bowls. One of the crew hissed, a hissing meant to be friendly. Smee answered with a hiss that was not at all friendly. Rory crouched halfway, thought better of it, stood again. He had no quarrel with opinionated animals. He would feed Smee later\u2014no, he would not. He would ignore Smee and Smee might ignore him, in the ancient contract.\n\nHe took the tram home. He stood by the window and watched the city slide by. The air had turned into that hot-cool Midwest spring weirdness where you take off your jacket and then put it back on and then take it off again as if being inside fabric and outside it could cure attention. He thought about what he could make that would be his and the city\u2019s, not in a false way, not in a Cincinnati chili cake that everyone would talk about because of the peppers and then never want to eat again. He wanted the judges to take a bite, close their eyes, and be in a kitchen they had never visited, with a lamp whose shade made everything into amber and claret.\n\nAt home, he dragged out his old, heavy stand mixer, the one his sister had found at a church sale and which made a brittle sound when you flipped the switch, as if it were startled to be asked to work again. He roasted the walnuts slowly until the kitchen smelled like smoke and promise. He beat butter until it went from yellow to cream to something he could almost spread on a wound. He sifted flour and wanted to cry for no reason he could tell, only this: that he got to do this, that his hands know how to move in this shape without being told.\n\nPickles thumped against his door in a way that suggested he had thrown himself at it for fun. He yowled once. He yowled like a trumpet. \u201cNot now,\u201d Rory called, ridiculous for answering a cat as if it were a neighbor. \u201cI\u2019m baking.\u201d\n\nHe used honey sparingly. He wanted its light, not its shout. He folded the nut into the batter and thought of the trees that made them, stubborn and handsome, standing in the yards of old houses where they had outlived three owners. He poured the batter into pans and slid them into the oven, then watched the oven window as if looking hard could make a cake rise truer.\n\nWhen the timer went, he did not fling open the door. He opened it like the face of someone he loved. The cakes domed slightly. Steam escaped with a sound that might have been his shoulders dropping. He tapped the top with his finger, felt the give and rebound. He let them cool and made the curd with a steady wrist. When he whisked in the butter at the last moment, the entire form transformed into something glossy, something that wanted to wrap itself around a spoon and never leave.\n\nHe set a small slice on a plate, put his fork in it to see how it would resist or surrender. It yielded with a sigh. He took a bite and waited for judgment that did not come. What arrived was a small clear feeling. This will work. This is not the best thing you will ever make, but it will work and you can fix the edges on the second go.\n\nHis phone buzzed. Lena. Mom wants to know if she should tell people. She said she\u2019ll tell the whole bar if you give her a reason.\n\nTell her to tell one person and to whisper it and watch how long it takes to reach the barbacks, he wrote.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t seen their mother in a while. You could want someone and not want the tangle of their stories. He had friends, he had Dee, he had a sister who sent him emails with subject lines like I Found This Loaf On Sale And I Thought Of You, Is That Sad, And Don\u2019t Answer That. He had Mrs. Kline and her mean jokes. He had a cat outside his door that rattled his lock sometimes with supreme confidence. He had a city that let him walk without asking too many questions. He had two days until he had to stand in front of ten thousand hands and bake.\n\nHe washed his bowls. He took out his piping tips and lined them up one by one to see which one he could coerce to be neat. He fell asleep on the couch for forty minutes and then woke with the curl of his spine aching and the urge to make another layer. He did, and it perforated his confidence when it sank in the middle like a boat with a secret. He cut the top with a long knife and told himself to stop for the night.\n\nOutside, the evening had decided to be noisy. The block had a good amount of street music, a trumpet and then a bucket drummer whose rhythms were less music than an argument with polyrhythms, and then a man selling ice cream from a cart that sang in tinny bells. He put his ear to the kitchen window screen and listened to the city. He thought of the baking competition again\u2014not the jolt of it anymore, but the steady weight, the way a stone sits in your pocket and makes you stand a little differently.\n\nIn bed, he rolled over and saw the silhouette of the framed photo. He reached up and found the switch on the lamp. The little square of light made his eyes prickle. He laughed as quietly as he could at himself, at the way joy made him slightly nauseous, like a boat. The last thing he thought before sleep dragged him down was that he needed to buy more parchment paper, and also a new apron that didn\u2019t have the ghost of so many onions in it, and also\u2014because he couldn\u2019t help it\u2014that he would keep his shoes tied tighter onstage because Pickles had reminded him of the treachery of laces.\n\nThe night before the final he decided to bake sweet rolls and take them to the crew because gratitude, because bribery, because sugar helps men lift things with a little more grace. He made the dough as he listened to a podcast in which a woman talked about grief like it was a neighborhood you could walk if you had a good map. He coaxed the dough to rise, then rolled it out and spread butter and cinnamon and brown sugar into the pale blanket, then rolled the whole thing up like a log and cut it into fat rounds. He arranged them in the pan with the tender care of a person setting stones where a river runs rough.\n\nAt two in the morning, someone in the hall laughed like a bark. Pickles shrieked and sprinted, bells furious. Rory looked through the peephole and saw nothing but a coat hung badly on a nail. He turned back to the kitchen. His oven\u2019s light had taken on the glow he associated with late-night conversations, the kind that ended with someone saying, Okay, okay, let\u2019s do the thing then.\n\nHe thought of the angry cat acting as hall monitor and shook his head. The cat had a job, too, he supposed. To be difficult and gorgeous and to make sure no one became too confident. He iced the rolls and put them aside.\n\nOn the morning of the final, he woke before the alarm, before the light, and stood there with his palms flat on the refrigerator door as if it were a question. He brought the sweet rolls and his recipe book and the apron that had a smooth new weight. He stared at himself in the mirror until his face looked like a stranger\u2019s, then like his own, then like Nana\u2019s, then like a stranger\u2019s again. Faces do that when they have to be borrowed by an audience for a while.\n\nHe met Dee outside the hall. She had changed out of her cleaning shirt into something she considered dressy, which was cleaner jeans and earrings that flashed when she moved her head. She took his hand, squeezed. \u201cGo in there and break their little hearts with a crumble. I\u2019ll be in the cheap seats with the loud people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least mispronounce my last name if you shout. That\u2019s tradition.\u201d He wanted to hug her but thought if he did his ribcage would crack like spun sugar.\n\nHe went through the stage door. The corridor smelled like coffee and dust and something metallic he couldn\u2019t place at first. The crew took his pan of rolls with grateful whoops. Someone handed him a mic pack. Abby tried out a joke on him and it didn\u2019t land, so they both agreed it was terrible and shook out nervous energy by standing on their toes.\n\nCassidy Vale walked by in her stage dress and sent him a thumbs-up that made something in his stomach roll all the way to the left and back. The judges sat at their long table and read the notes someone had prepared for them with deadly attention, like people who would not tolerate being surprised unless they could clap first.\n\nSmee appeared again, tail high, stalking past the racks of sheet pans. A production assistant made a face at him and Smee bared his teeth in return and then\u2014abrupt, as if making decisions was how he made a living\u2014leapt into the empty mixing bowl on the table next to Rory and curled into a judgmental loaf. A woman with a headset approached and tried to scoop him. Smee went boneless in the way of cats who know the rules and refuse to acknowledge them. The woman swore under her breath and then remembered she was wearing a mic and switched the swear into something else. \u201cSmee, I will personally buy you a pound of fish if you vacate this prep area in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nRory almost laughed and then didn\u2019t. The cat opened one eye. He could have sworn the iris narrowed more at him than at anyone else, as if it had picked a direction for its disdain and planned to carry it through for the rest of its nine and a half lives. He reached out a hand and then withdrew it. No, best not. Let the universe deal with its own mascots. He checked his mise en place again, familiarizing himself with the angles of the knives, the way the drawers resisted closing, the stubborn edge of the counter. Here he would stand; here he would whisk; here he would fail or fly slightly.\n\nWhen the crowd filtered in, a slow tide, the din shifted from backstage clinks to human sound. He heard, somewhere in the cheap seats, someone yelling his name in a voice that had seen cigarette smoke and roads. He didn\u2019t dare look. He closed his eyes for one heartbeat, maybe two. Nana\u2019s voice in his head, or else his own: Flour. Butter. Sugar. Eggs. Don\u2019t fuss it to death. Let it be what it wants to be.\n\nHe opened his eyes. The lights flooded the stage in a clean brightness that bleached him of his bad thoughts. Cassidy Vale turned to the camera and smiled, and in that instant every irregular corner of his life felt like it had been smoothed into a story. He set his hands on the bench, and beside him the cat\u2019s bell gave a small, disdainful jingle. He could almost swear Smee blinked slow and smug, as if he\u2019d seen things like this before and knew how they turned.\n\nHe breathed. He listened for the cue. And when it came, when the show leaped to life and the timers began ticking like a thousand tiny hearts, his hands moved with their own thin luck. He was still thinking of butter, of Nana\u2019s lamp, of the river, and of the city that had let him scrub it every night and had finally, finally turned toward him the bright face of its stage.The first challenge was called Roots and Rivers, which sounded like a craft beer but meant a thing he could hold on to. Cassidy did the announcing with a grin that had teeth in it, her voice looping through the hall and back to the stage as if it had swung on the chandeliers. Tell us the story of your place, she said, tell us what you have dragged here in your apron pockets, tell us what your hands have learned. Make something the judge will want to eat and will also want to marry. Sixty minutes. Go. The clatter and hiss rose, metal finding metal, bodies finding patterns they had drilled into themselves in kitchens that no one had filmed, and Rory\u2019s hands, mercifully, remembered before his brain could interfere. He measured with the thrift he had always admired in Nana, no heaping, no starve, his fingers leveled off sugar with the back of a knife the way she had taught him, as if he were smoothing a bed for someone who would sleep badly if the sheet was rumpled.\n\nHe started his rye crust first, because crust forgave if you treated it with a delicate neglect. The flour was a brownish color that made him want to trust it. The butter had been softened by the lights\u2014he could feel the heat of them on his cheekbones when he looked up too long\u2014and he cut it in with a tool that had not been designed for this exact motion but did not complain. He worked quickly but not fast, that fine distinction you either learned or did not; fast was panic wearing shoes, quick was tenderness with a deadline. The dough came together with a sigh and he patted it into a disc and slid it into the cooler drawer at his station, the one that clicked like a tongue every time you opened it too abruptly. Honey warmed at the back of the stove, the scent already making his thoughts go widen and deepen, like river pools. He cracked eggs and separated them by muscle memory, the whites clean as a whistle, the yolks plump as promises. The walnuts he had roasted low that morning he chopped with a measured brutality, just enough to release the oil and give the mouth something to think about. The curd he began last because he disliked a smug curd; he wanted it to arrive the way a good guest did, late enough to be interesting.\n\nSmee decided the action might also belong to him. He drifted out from under the metal shelving with a lope that suggested he had somewhere to be and that it was unfortunately here. Jace swore softly when Smee brushed his ankle and Penelope spoke to the cat the way you speak to weather, with a respect you hope will be mistaken for persuasion. Rory did not tempt fate by offering a hand. He kept stirring. Sugar, lemon, fire, attention. He watched the edge of the curd go from loose to persuasive and whisked in butter at the moment his chest told him, at that exact shade of yellow that suggested sanctity. Behind him, Cassidy\u2019s voice rose and fell and rose again, translating the chaos into a narrative people at home could fold into their living rooms and their Sunday quiet.\n\nWhen he rolled out the rye crust and set it into the pan, his fingers moved in a tidy ballet. He trimmed with a paring knife that had seen better days and pinched a rough scallop that would never make the cover of a magazine and did not need to. He poured in the nut mixture and let the honey thread through it like a small golden river, then poured in a custard that smelled like lemon rind and salt. He had thought briefly of making two tarts, one as an offering to luck and one to taste and adjust, and then he had remembered that he was on live television, and that this was not the bake sale at St. Gertrude\u2019s. He slid the tart into the oven with a care that made his spine ache with concentration. He did not slam the door. He turned the dial as if it were a volume knob and he was easing the music down instead of summoning the heat up.\n\nHe washed his bowl and wiped his counter because of who he was and where he had been for ten years every night, then started on a small garnish of candied walnut shards that he did not believe in but which television demanded like a tax. The sugar seized on the first try because he looked up at the screen that had his own face on it and flinched at being doubled. He laughed at himself\u2014it came out like a cough\u2014and began again, this time staring at the pot as if his eyes could persuade molecules to behave. The sugar melted, went clear, turned straw, and he tipped in the nuts and stirred with the speed of someone who had learned to move babies from one shoulder to the other without waking them. On the other side of him Abby had a problem with her pastry cream and shouted for a strainer, and he handed her his without looking, an exchange that felt like something you did in a war you weren\u2019t sure you\u2019d chosen.\n\nThe oven door opened with a small catch that felt personal. The tart wobbled when he gave the pan a gentle nudge, the good sort of wobble that promised to set as it cooled, not the tragic sort that said you have failed in a way you will carry home in your coat pocket and feel with your fingers on the train. He set it on the rack, stepped back, and pretended for a second that he was alone in a kitchen with a radio muttering small news about clouds. When it was just cool enough to risk, he loosened the tart and felt it let go with a sound that was mostly imagination, a tiny sigh. He slid the curd into a piping bag and drew a spiral from the center out, as if he were measuring time on its surface. He flicked on the torch and kissed the top in spots, a rumor of heat, a little bruise of color, not enough to make it costume.\n\nThe judges came like a tide that had checked a schedule. They were three, a triptych he had studied in internet clips until he had met each of their eyebrows like neighbors. There was the pastry chef who had a voice that could cut bread, the critic with the pen like a tiny spear, and the baker with the big hands who made everything sound like a coaching speech somebody\u2019s father had given on a field at dusk. They asked him questions while they tasted and he answered without tasting the words first. He told them black walnut was Ohio to him, not in that postcard way, but in the way that bitterness could shade sweetness and make both feel true. He told them about rye and honey and how he liked when things from fields met things from cupboards. The critic closed her eyes when she chewed and Rory pretended not to watch her mouth. The big-handed baker said something kind about restraint. The pastry chef tapped the curd with her spoon and said, in the tone of someone pronouncing on a modest political scandal, that the set was on the softer side. He nodded and said he\u2019d been shy of heat; the lights seemed to be doing some of the work, stupid as that sounded. They moved on and he watched their backs recede and let his lungs remember how to bring air in without making a show of it.\n\nBetween rounds, everything that had felt like a private action was revealed for what it was: a small part of an operation that had been built like a temporary city. A makeup woman swept at his forehead with a brush the size of a baby\u2019s fist and told him not to rub his face because the camera would interpret his gesture as guilt. Cassidy appeared as if she had been shot out of a tube and asked him if he was okay, if he was loving it, if his hands were done being shy. He wanted to tell her that his heart had set to a metronome that was not his, but he said he was good, he said the tart had behaved, he said words like hometown and humbled while trying to arrange his mouth into a shape that was not a flinch. Behind Cassidy he saw, or thought he saw, Lena\u2019s ponytail like a flag six rows up. He caught a flash of a familiar jaw, a notch in a lip, a laugh that came out of a woman with a cigarette voice. His stomach did something catastrophic and then righted itself. He put his hands back on the bench to keep them from trying to swim.\n\nThe technical reached out of the past and took him by the back of his shirt. They handed them recipe cards that could have been telegrams from an anxious aunt. Make schnecken, the card said, and below that a list of ingredients that had the vagueness of poetry. Make dough. Prove. Make caramel. Assemble. Bake until done. Penelope made a noise that sounded like relief in a language he didn\u2019t know, and Jace muttered about his grandmother from Zanesville who had a pan for this and no patience for people who called things by their wrong names. Rory had read about schnecken, had seen the word turn into sticky when someone moved it through their mouth. He thought of the German restaurant Penelope inhabited, of the way Over-the-Rhine held its history and dumped it too, a place that could be fancy and could be a story about a bricked-up door.\n\nHe made a dough like he was making an ally. He coaxed it into being with warm milk and sugar and the quantity of butter that made the judge with the pen sniff and smile and not write anything. He leaned on it with the heel of his hand and then with his fingertips, reading it for signs the way other people read clouds for ships. He tucked it under a damp cloth and willed the air to be an incubator. He made caramel with a toughness around his mouth; he had never liked being watched when sugar was crossing its dangerous street. He swirled the pan instead of stirring. He added a splash of cream when it seemed to protest and the pan coughed like an actor. He rolled the dough when he could not bear it any longer, and it rolled out as obedient as a child who had already gotten in trouble once. He spread the butter and sugar with a palette knife no one called a palette knife on this show, then rolled and cut and set each scroll into the caramel like a ship into harbor.\n\nSmee came back when they were sliding pans into ovens, because of course he did, because wherever there was urgency cats discovered an appetite. He wove between ankles and feinted at a fallen raisin as if it were a mouse. A production assistant looked at Rory like, control your pet, and Rory looked back like, the only animal I control is my own breath. When the timer went and he pulled the pan out, the top had a gloss he could have used as a mirror. He turned them out and one of the buns slid entirely off the pan, onto the floor, and sat there like a fat fallen soldier. He froze for a beat. Then the old mover part of him woke up. He bent, scooped with a new spatula, tossed it into the trash with a dignity that made it look intentional, and reshuffled the rest in the pan so the gap did not show like a missing tooth. Abby winked at him as if to say, I saw, but I saw everything, so don\u2019t worry.\n\nThe judges tasted blind and their eyebrows did coded dances that the internet would slow down into GIFs later. Penelope was first, because of course she was; she carried yeast in her genes and a short fuse that blew in the right direction. Abby took third. Jace, who had overproofed because the lights had convinced him time had softened, sighed so loudly they should have miked it. Rory stood in second and felt relief turn into something like disappointment and then remembered he was in a room with people who made bread with their teeth and gave himself a mental slap for greed.\n\nFor the last round, they brought out a small forest of clear cake boxes and stands that glinted like the inside of a shell. This is your showstopper, Cassidy said, and the audience made a sound that was hunger and catcall and sympathy. Tell us a celebration, Rory heard, tell us the thing you are trying to build when the world tells you to calm down. He had drawn his plan in pencil on a napkin two nights ago when a bus had refused to arrive, a sketch that looked like a bridge and a crown had had a clever child. He saw now how ridiculous the sugar crown was going to be under this humidity and light, and he changed it while washing his hands with the vigor of a surgeon. He would make brown-butter ermine frosting because butter had spoken to him when he was half-awake, and because it wanted to be whipped into a thing that hugged layers without arguing.\n\nHe baked four layers of honey walnut cake with rye flour just enough to give the crumb a conversational weight. He trimmed, he leveled, he brushed each cut surface with a thin wash of honey he had warmed to make it less stubborn. The lemon curd had set like a promise this time; he stirred it smooth and spread it like a thin sun between the lower layers, resisting the urge to pile it on the way a person resists the urge to make a joke at a funeral. He stacked with dowels like a cautious carpenter. He had trained his hands to control weight and balance with mops and bins; now he used the same selection of muscles to persuade cake to behave. He glanced once at the screen when it showed him, and his face looked less like someone in a police lineup and more like someone trying to remember something they loved, which was as much as he could ask from any mirror.\n\nHe made sugar, because he had not been able to let go of the light in his drawing. He cooked it to hard crack, the thermometer a slender prophet that did not always tell truth, and he poured it out into puddles he tried to pull into ropes. The air grinned and refused to help. The ropes broke into shards that had a beauty he could sell to a poet and a fragility he could not use to crown anything. He stared at them, at the way they threw light on the counter and made his hands look injured. He lifted a piece and it broke in his palm and it felt like brittle ice on a river at late winter, and that was when he understood what he should do. He would not fight the air; he would ask it to kneel. He arranged the shards on the top tier like plates of river ice leaning out of one another, as if spring had come and pushed them to the edges. He sprinkled a dust of ground walnut around them that looked like the particular gravel of a riverbank. He tied a barely-there ribbon of candied lemon peel where the top tier met the one below, not to decorate but to hide a seam that wanted to gossip. He stood back and thought of Nana\u2019s lamp and its small jewels of colored glass, and he felt, for a breath, forgiven for every time he had doubted his hands.\n\nCassidy arrived in a whorl of perfume and encouragement and stuck a microphone near his mouth while not looking at him, her show eyes on the lens. She asked him what his cake meant and he told her about thaw, about the bridge, about the way honey dripped in March on his tongue and made him think that maybe he would not sleep forever. She nodded and did that look she had that said she could put what he had said into television without him losing it to edits. \u201cAnd that cat,\u201d she said softly, when her smile was pointed elsewhere and the crowd roared for Abby\u2019s tower, \u201chas a vendetta against equipment. Watch your corners.\u201d\n\nIt was as if Smee had heard his name in the secret frequency cats owned. He appeared from underneath a swath of black drape and leapt onto the lower shelf of Rory\u2019s station with the ease of a creature born spring-loaded. He stared at the cake. Rory stared at him. Two seconds stretched like sugar threads. Then the cat made a small, dismissive snort and strolled away, tail up, a flag of contempt. The audience caught it and laughed the laugh of a city. Rory\u2019s shoulders unclenched by degrees that had names in languages people used mostly for prayers.\n\nPenelope\u2019s showstopper was a bread sculpture that looked like a church had been braided. Jace made something so tall it looked like it resented gravity and had been brought here against its will. Abby\u2019s cake was a polite marvel with little piped flowers the color of good gossip. The heat prickled under Rory\u2019s hair. A curl came loose from the sweat and fell into his eye, and he pushed it back without thinking, smearing a line of frosting across his temple like war paint. Someone near the judges\u2019 table pointed and grinned. He thought, fine, then, let me be a cartoon for you and a baker for me.\n\nWhen time was called the room pushed its breath out and then fought to pull it back in. He set his hands flat on the bench and told them, aloud, barely louder than a whisper, thank you. He had been learned out of religion but kept its habits. The judges came as a set and neither of them tried to smile first. They had taken in the brief. They were ready to intake outcomes. The critic had a pen that matched the color of her shoes. She asked about the shards and he told her what the city did in March, how the river broke and pretended to disappear and came back the same but different. The pastry chef cut a slice with a seriousness that made him stand up straighter. The big-handed baker closed his whole mouth around a bite and then around a second before his hand had come back to the plate, which was really all the statement anyone needed.\n\nThey liked the crumb. They liked the imagined restraint of the icing. They liked the way the lemon refused to be a shout and the walnut refused to be a sulk. The critic said something about the rye, about how it had given the cake a backbone the city would recognize. The pastry chef mentioned the seam, which meant she had found it, which meant she was exactly who he thought she was. The big-handed baker said, \u201cThis eats like a person who works all night and then goes home and remembers why,\u201d and Rory felt, for the second time that day, his eyes get watery for a reason that was not tragedy. They moved on and he watched them go, feeling lighter and also as if he had been carved. He looked up into the house and there it was, the jaw, the lip notch, only now it was undeniably his mother with a plastic cup of something and an expression he had used on himself in mirrors when he tasted too many failures in a row. Next to her Lena held a sign that said Go Augie in letters that had run when she cried. He did not know whether to laugh or to sit down on the floor. He split the difference by widening his mouth in a way that felt like light and did not let out any sound at all.\n\nBackstage while they cut for a commercial he leaned against a rolling cart and breathed into his shirt so as not to fog up any cameras. Dee found him because she could find him in a power outage, and she put her hands on his face like she was checking for fever. He said, \u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d and it was not an accusation, only a piece of news he didn\u2019t know where to put. Dee said, \u201cOf course she is,\u201d and then added, \u201cIf she tries to storm the stage I will tackle her and break two of my bones and hers.\u201d He laughed and it came out like a guided sigh. \u201cYou did good,\u201d she said, simple as that, like she was giving him a drink of water. \u201cIf they don\u2019t know what that tastes like, it\u2019s on their tongues, not yours.\u201d\n\nThey lined up, the four of them, in that alphabet they had become, and the air cooled the sweat on his neck in a way that made him shiver. He watched the screens show the small cut scenes the crew had made of their faces, their hands, their houses from outside, their dogs and snake plants and nephews in soccer jerseys. His own montage included the sink in his apartment, which had not been cleaned enough to satisfy him in this context no matter how he scrubbed it, and the shot of his hands holding the photo of Nana that had made him want to tell the producer to please be kinder to ghosts. Cassidy did that thing where she moved down the line and made each of them look into her face and then into the camera and not trip on the tape at their feet. She asked them how they felt and they lied in sincere voices. He said he was honored and did not say he was also tired in every cell and the kind of wild calm you have when you are just after crying.\n\nDeliberation was quick and long. The judges moved their mouths behind their hands and made notes and then put their pens down and picked them up again because the drama demanded an extra gesture. The stage lights hummed and someone three rows up shouted Woo in the way of a person whose vocabulary had boiled. Smee reappeared like a cameo, sat on the edge of the prize table as if he were guarding the invisible crown, and cleaned his paw with the slow relish of someone who could abolish whole systems by sleeping through them. A production assistant attempted to shoo him with her will and then surrendered and worked around him. Rory felt his heart do a slow, pronounced thing like a drum in a parade no one had asked for. He thought of his oven at home, its tired light, the way it complained when he asked too much. He thought of the woman with the bee hat, of Sammi\u2019s espresso shot like a blessing, of Mrs. Kline\u2019s doorstick and Pickles\u2019 bell, of Lena\u2019s sign with the old name he wore as a bruise and a joke. He thought of Dee\u2019s body, the way it folded around the cart when she leaned, the way she put her mouth next to a plant at four in the morning and told it news.\n\nCassidy returned to the center and lifted her arm in a way that said, all right, we have done what we came here to do. She said the names of the judges in full like incantations, and it occurred to him how much of television was simply saying things with cadence and pretending the air had always sounded like that. She held a card. He thought of his Nana saying, when the heaven television calls, you answer, and he felt a giggle come up the same pipe where he kept his grief. He kept his face under control in the way custodians keep the floors under fluorescent lights, calm, even, a sweep that does not betray the muscle it has cost. Someone behind him cleared their throat; he thought it was Jace and hoped it was not a sob. He touched the bench with his fingertips because he had touches left and no place to put them.\n\nCassidy made a joke that let the crowd exhale impatience in a straight line and then she looked into the camera with both her soul and her training and tore the card open with a scarlet nail. The judges arrays brightened as if on cue. The cat lifted his head and blinked because the envelope made noise that had been designed to interest him. Rory did not move, because moving might jostle the moment, and if you jostled the moment it might spill, and if it spilled the mess would be on his shoes, and he had cleaned enough messes in other people\u2019s shoes to know the sorrow of that. He felt the hall holding its breath in a way that reminded him of ovens and of morning and of how a city can go quiet before it wakes itself violently.\n\nHe saw, as Cassidy drew breath, the shape of a bridge in his head, and he did not know if it was the Roebling or the one between the boy he had been and the man he had let himself become. He knew only that a thing like a voice was about to attach to him, either for a minute or for a while, and that he would go home afterward and stand in his little kitchen with the lamp on and open the jar of honey and let it ribbon into a spoon and taste it, and that the taste would be the same or it would be better or it would be worse and either way he would still make flour move and butter change, and either way he would still tie his shoes and be watched by a cat and pick at a sticker on a plastic bin. He kept his eyes on Cassidy\u2019s mouth because it was the only honest thing in a world of lights. The room leaned toward her like wheat to wind. He did not hear his heart because it had chosen that moment to step into a quieter room and sit down.Chapter 4\n\nCassidy said his name in a way that folded and unfolded the room. There was a beat where he thought he had misheard because his own breath came loud, another beat where he saw Penelope\u2019s face in profile, a third where Jace\u2019s hat dipped, a fourth where Abby\u2019s hand went to her mouth to hold in something she did not want to escape. Then his name, undeniable as a stamp, was in the air again and hands were making the sound hands make when they are allowed to forget themselves, and he forgot himself too, not because of winning but because of the wave of the crowd and the way a city can make its own weather.\n\nFor a second he stood exactly where he was, the way you do when a bus arrives while you are still considering your destination. Cassidy reached him first, and the card she had torn was still in her other hand like a dead butterfly. Her dress caught the light, all deliberate shimmer, and her smile made a small serious shape before it arranged itself into the broadcast grin. He wanted not to cry because he had told himself stories about men who did not, and the older story in him, the one that wore Nana\u2019s apron like a vestment, told him not to play coy with joy. He put his palms on the bench, then took them off and opened his arms and the feeling climbed into his chest like a second set of lungs.\n\nCassidy said things into the microphone that became a thin music behind his ears. He saw the trophy on the table\u2014a heavy, funny crown made of brushed metal that looked like the bridge and like the top of a pie crust had had a practical child. A production assistant attempted to lift Smee so the cat would not be formally crowned by accident, and Smee leaped off the cloth with a grace that mocked the concept of gravity and disappeared with his bell shouting behind him. He reached for the metal crown and it was cold, a good cold, the kind that made the palm honest. When they set it on his head for a photograph, he felt ridiculous and then quickly felt something else: the soft click of the story snapping shut around him like a locket.\n\nHe spoke into Cassidy\u2019s microphone and heard himself from a distance, as if he had been recorded long ago and was being played back without his consent. He thanked the judges and the city and the crew and his Nana, who would have said, is there anything left in your mouth when you\u2019re finished with all that thanking, because if there is you didn\u2019t do it right. He said Dee\u2019s name and saw, through the lights, a pair of hands go up and wave like flags. He said custodians out loud and felt his face go warm at the word, the way he always did when he named the job that had kept him steady. He told the cameras the thing he had repeated to himself under his breath for years: do the basics and let them be the miracle. He did not say he was scared every day, because fear would have tried to translate itself into tears and he wanted to be able to see.\n\nThe judges shook his hand in turns. The pastry chef squeezed too hard in a way that proved tender. The critic spoke low in his ear and said, \u201cYou were careful where other people would have been fussy,\u201d and he wondered if that was the most intimate thing anyone had ever told him in public. The big-handed baker slapped his shoulder with a weight that rearranged something in his spine and said, \u201cGo home and sleep and then get up and bake the way you did yesterday and the day before that, and don\u2019t let anyone put their voice in your wrist.\u201d He nodded because his throat had closed.\n\nPenelope hugged him like a cousin at a funeral, all proper back pats and then a squeeze at the end that broke the pattern. \u201cEnjoy your parade,\u201d she said. \u201cThen come eat bread with me sometime and don\u2019t talk about celebrity because my starter will reject you.\u201d\n\nAbby kissed his cheek and left a stamp there that he would discover later in a bathroom mirror and laugh at, like a cartoon bruise. \u201cDo not ever admit that you almost flamb\u00e9ed your own eyebrows with a torch,\u201d she said. \u201cWait at least two years.\u201d\n\nJace took his hand and held it in both of his, an old-man gesture that looked comical on his young face. \u201cTell your sister to put my hat on her dog,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was some cake, Grady. The shards were a risk. They paid rent.\u201d\n\nThe house lights shifted and he felt the temperature change on his skin. He looked up toward the cheap seats, the ones that had given him his lungs, and found Lena because she was standing and because she did not sit when she should. She had made her sign from the wrong kind of cardboard and it had bowed in the middle where the condensation from her drink had touched it. Next to her was the jaw and the notch and the laugh lines a person gets from practicing an expression even when there is no one to practice it for. His mother\u2019s mouth was not moving. It was a line it made when it had to hold a lot of words that would otherwise be loose. He did not wave because if he did he feared he would make of this moment a different piece of theater than the city had paid for, but he allowed himself the smallest nod, a hinge you couldn\u2019t see at a distance.\n\nBackstage he handed the crown to a production assistant so he could wash his hands and then took it back and set it on top of a rolling rack where the cool metal could remind him what a joke looked like made into object. Dee found him in the squeezing sea of bodies and fitted herself to him like a brace, her arms firm around his ribs, her chin a weight on his shoulder for a second and then gone. She did not say congratulations the way people say it like a balloon; she said, \u201cI knew,\u201d and he believed that, not because anybody knows anything but because she had spoken over his head in a way he had come to associate with miracles. She inspected his face with a nurse\u2019s eye and licked her thumb and wiped a streak of frosting off his temple the same way she had once wiped something worse from a stranger\u2019s cheek in a hallway. \u201cYou have to show your teeth to some microphones. Do not gargle. Articulate. And for the love of somebody\u2019s god, don\u2019t let them convince you to cry on cue.\u201d\n\nThe press room had been made out of a rehearsal space. It smelled like coffee and hairspray and excitement that had a price. He sat in a chair that spun slightly even when he did not make it, a minor carnival ride he regretted instantly. There were flashes. There were questions that were the same question wearing different shirts. How did it feel. What would he do next. Did he have a sweetheart and was the sweetheart available for a reaction shot. He spoke the way he baked, trying to parcel out sugar and salt in reasonable measures. He did not say what he had thought of saying, which was that he had been trying for so much less than this for so long, and that sometimes less had been too stubborn to be caught. He said Nana again and felt like he was pushing the edges of her name with a finger to see where it would bruise. Cassidy slid in and out, corralling and flirting and holding space with the expertise of someone who could make a room think it was a good room to be.\n\nWhen the crew released him from his public, he went to the edge of a hallway and stood in a shadow near a mop closet out of habit, and that was where Lena found him. She barreled into the shadow as if it had been designed to fit her. The ponytail slapped his collarbone and she punched his chest with her small and lethal knuckles, not because she was mad but because she didn\u2019t have an organ for how proud she was and had to use her knuckles as a substitute.\n\n\u201cAugie,\u201d she said, and he wanted to tell her that the name was an old coat you only put on for family, and then he thought of the sign and felt the cheap cardboard bow again in his chest. \u201cYou idiot. You did it. You made me cry in front of a man with a bucket of popcorn the size of Wyoming. I hate you. I love you.\u201d\n\nHe held her in a way that had to be adjusted to fit the metal crown she craned to inspect and then refused to touch. \u201cLena,\u201d he said, and her name made his voice smaller. \u201cDid she\u2014did you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe came,\u201d Lena said. \u201cI brought her because if I had not she would have found a way to arrive wrong. She did good. She sat. She didn\u2019t yell anything you\u2019ll have to die with. She wants to see you if you want that. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll tell her we have to take a detour on the way home because the bridge is out, and then I\u2019ll drive her to Indiana and make her do shots with a man who sells knives.\u201d\n\nHe laughed and then felt the prickle behind his eyes again. He had promised himself he would not cry in a room where people could harvest it for B-roll, so he looked at a fire extinguisher and said, \u201cFive minutes. I can do five.\u201d\n\nLena pressed her mouth to his jaw and then went to fetch their mother, who came like a person walking down a church aisle and then remembered she was not the bride. She had put on lipstick like a decision. Her hair was a nest that had refused to be reinterpreted and he was glad of that, ridiculous as it was. She stopped ten feet away and put her hand to her mouth and dropped it and put it back. The line in her face was not as hard as it had been the last time he had allowed himself to be seen. He did not know what to do with his hands and so he tucked them into his own elbows like a cold person will.\n\n\u201cYou look like him,\u201d she said, and then scolded herself for bringing that ghost into the hall, her eyes cutting sideways as if a camera would catch the thought and sell it. \u201cYou did good, Rory. You looked \u2026 you looked like yourself. I was proud. If a person is allowed to be proud. You know I don\u2019t know the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no rules,\u201d he said, and knew immediately that this was a lie they had all built rooms on. \u201cThank you for coming. You didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to see you when you were the size the world says you are. I don\u2019t want to miss anymore sized moments if I can help it. I could help it before. I can\u2019t now. It\u2019s not a speech. It\u2019s just true.\u201d She reached and then stopped. \u201cI won\u2019t. I won\u2019t touch unless you\u2026 I know you wear your old name like a brand some days.\u201d\n\nHe stepped into the reach because he did not know what he would do with the feeling if he kept it. Her hands smelled like some old bar soap and a sweet drink that had no fruit in it. The embrace lasted the length of a small song. When they stepped back he saw the wetness at the edge of her eyes and his mouth made a shape that could have been a laugh if someone else had done it.\n\n\u201cDo you want to come up after?\u201d he asked, surprising himself with his mouth\u2019s boldness. \u201cI made rolls. The cinnamon sort. They aren\u2019t fancy.\u201d\n\nShe flinched at fancy like a gnat had flown at her eye. \u201cI won\u2019t darken your door. Not tonight. I\u2019ll just go home with your sister and not make her turn the radio on if she doesn\u2019t want it, I swear. But I\u2019ll take a roll if you make me, because I\u2019ll die otherwise not knowing if they taste like your Nana\u2019s. She would have eaten me alive if I\u2019d said they did. She\u2019d have said, Lucille, your tongue is a lazy thing.\u201d\n\nLena appeared behind their mother\u2019s shoulder and made an exaggerated nodding motion that meant, Good, good, this is not a bad thing, nobody is on fire, I will keep the fire extinguisher and you get the rolls. He said he would bring the pan to the stage door and she could take it like contraband. He touched the metal crown because it was easier than touching anything else and then let the press swallow him again for a few last bites.\n\nHe had his picture taken with the crew because he had promised himself he would, and with the lighting technicians who had made him into a person and not a lamp, and with Cassidy, who whispered, \u201cWe can cut the part where I forgot which side your camera loves. You are a charm. Enjoy your nap.\u201d He found the tray of sweet rolls and transferred most of them to a box because it was psychologically easier to give away a box than a pan. On his way to the stage door he passed Smee sitting on the center chair of a row meant for cellists like he had bought a ticket and written a letter about the seat he required. The cat flicked his tail when he saw Rory\u2019s box and made the particular face of a being who had hoped for salmon and been handed bread. \u201cWe can\u2019t all be pleased,\u201d Rory told him, as if the cat worked on his shift and not for the universe.\n\nOutside, the air had shifted into a softer register, the kind that made your skin grateful for having been scrubbed. He handed the box to Lena, who held it like a prize, and to his mother, who took one roll right then and bit into it with the theatricality of a judge on a show that did not exist. The two of them made noises like television and then the noises quieted and the look on their faces went private, and he stood for a second and watched them have what he hoped they were having, which was not nostalgia so much as a small green shoot of mercy.\n\nBy the time he got home, the crown under his arm like a large expensive book he did not plan to read, the neighborhood had shed its concert clothes and put on laundry. A man across the street was hosing his stairs with an attention that suggested he had borrowed the water. The trumpet player on the corner was practicing scales and failing to be embarrassed. He lugged the crown up the stairs as if it contained sand. Mrs. Kline\u2019s door creaked open like a theatrical cue.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d she said, as if he had been out shopping and had to tell her whether the store still carried her favorite brand of canned peaches. He lifted the metal in his hand and her mouth did something unplanned and then she made it into a snort. \u201cFigures,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my tenants are going to get famous they may as well do it for sweets and not podcasts. Let me see your head. Did they make you wear that like a toddler. I\u2019ll get the cat. He too deserves to be humiliated.\u201d\n\nPickles waltzed into the hall fat with approval and knocked his bell against the baseboard on purpose. The cat slalomed between Rory\u2019s ankles as if to say, explain yourself. Rory bent and touched one orange ear with two fingers and said, \u201cWe did a thing.\u201d The cat stared at him with pupils like coins and then butted his head into the crown with an insulted acceptance that made Mrs. Kline wheeze her laugh. \u201cI knew you could,\u201d she said, and the way she said could made him feel he had lifted something significant from her as well as from himself.\n\nHe set the crown on the kitchen table and it settled there in a disconcertingly official way, like a city seal. He turned on the lamp with the soft click and opened his window onto a small square of evening and stood with his hand on the sill until the breeze cooled the sweat in his hair. The apartment smelled of sugar that had receded and the slight bitter he got when his oven had been too ambitious. He poured a glass of water and did not drink from it right away. He leaned his head against the cabinet and kept his eyes open in case his face tried to do its own thing.\n\nHis phone buzzed like a wasp in a jar. There were texts he could scroll. There were emails he could pretend to answer. There were two voicemails from unknown numbers that had the tone of opportunity wearing a suit. He put the phone on the table next to the crown and went to wash bowls instead. It had been what saved him. It could save him again. The dishwater went cloudy fast and the plate with the frosting smears released them as if the day had always been ready to turn clean. He imagined the stagehands eating the last of the rolls with their heads together, not talking at all but taking the sweetness like the way a person will map their own route home.\n\nWhen he had put the last bowl in the rack; when he had wiped the counter, then wiped it again; when he had arranged his piping tips in a line and put them back in a box because you put away sharp things when you are tired; when he had sat on the floor with his back against the cabinet and closed his eyes and put his palms flat on the cool linoleum\u2014the knock came. It was the polite two and a half of someone with manners and a history of being ignored.\n\nHe stood and did not put his hand to his hair because there was nothing hair could do to help. On the other side of the door was the beekeeper woman in her ridiculous hat like a constellation. She was panting, which made the hat bob, and she had a jar in her hand.\n\n\u201cI watched on television,\u201d she said, each word dragging a small invisible cart. \u201cThis is the good stuff, the stuff I don\u2019t sell unless you ask me in a certain voice, which you did without knowing today. I thought you might want to celebrate wrong. With toast or something. I don\u2019t know how you people do it. I know how bees do. They dance. They move figure-eights and tell each other where the flowers are. You should probably dance but you probably won\u2019t, being Irish and male and ruined by church. So take this. I charge fifty. I will not take your money. That is how you accept a gift.\u201d\n\nHe took the jar and it was warm like a hand. He looked through it at the kitchen light and saw gold turned into a mood. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you a cake,\u201d he said, because that was the only language he had for that kind of kindness. \u201cYou\u2019ll hate it. But you\u2019ll pretend otherwise.\u201d\n\nShe cackled and the hat shook again. \u201cBless you, boy,\u201d she said, and down the stairs she went, calling her feet bad names in a way that suggested they were used to it.\n\nHe thought, vaguely, that he should sleep for a week and then open a bakery by accident. He thought, more precisely, that he had to tell Dee first if he was going to change anything, because you don\u2019t walk off a night shift without a salute. He set the honey on the counter like a small altar and took out the bread he had bought because he thought he might need crumbs and did not. He made toast and the oven tried to talk him out of it by failing to ignite cleanly and then consenting to burn the corners. He poured honey like a slow mistake and ate standing up, each bite a simple returning. He let himself think, very softly, that he had earned this not because of television or crown or crowd, but because he had done the basics until they formed a life without permission.\n\nHe woke at four out of an old habit and because joy shares a bed badly. He pulled on his work pants and felt for the familiar weight of keys that had marked him for so long he sometimes thought of them as jewelry. He wrote a note in pencil to himself with the three things he\u2019d thought of in the night like thieves: parchment paper, new apron, call producer back only after coffee. He looked at the crown on his table and laughed at it, not unkindly. He left it there to watch the window with the serious expression of a person guarding a small country.\n\nDee was in the lobby of their building with her cart already loaded, her travel mug steaming, her earrings from last night turned back into small loops. She cocked her head and narrowed her eyes and then smiled in the way you smile at a story you already know. \u201cWe get to clean the story,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine that. I\u2019m going to polish that conference table with my face.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sleep,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI sleep. I nap sideways. That counts as sleep at my age. I watched you and then I made spaghetti and then Pickles came to the window and told me a fight story in his little bell. He has an enemy who is a possum now. Things are happening.\u201d She wrapped his knuckles with her fingers in a quick blessing. \u201cYou take today easy as you can. They\u2019ll want you to go on the morning show and then the noon news and then some radio where a man tells you about sin and traffic. Pick what lets you be a person and not a picture.\u201d\n\nThey wheeled their carts through the predawn quiet that had been his anyway. The building accepted him the way a familiar room accepts a changed thing: by making the change feel ordinary while not pretending not to notice. The air on the twelfth floor was thick with yesterday and every day, carpet and coffee, air registers that had been neglected by a budget, the chemical chill of glass cleaner. He breathed it like bread. When he put his mop down and began, the sound belonged to him again. The bucket rolled over a ridged tile and made the thrum that always reminded him of a song he could never name.\n\nThey did not speak for twenty minutes. The mops took the conversation. The streaks diminished. Dee refilled her bottle and whistled a single tuneless line because she had whistled that line every day he had known her. When they reached the north windows, he stood and looked out. The river lay in its bed with dignity, unbothered by any crowns people had tried on in its name. A barge moved with the implacability he envied. Over Covington, two kitchen lights came on at once like a signal someone had forgotten how to read. He thought of his shards of sugar placed to mimic the ice and felt a fond embarrassment, the way you do when you hear yourself laugh on a recording.\n\n\u201cYou gonna quit?\u201d Dee asked, not adding the word me because she was practicing generosity as a sport.\n\nHe wrung the mop without looking at it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to. Not immediately. They might tell me I have to if I\u2019m going to pretend to be a person in a magazine for a little while. But this is my\u2026 this is my breathing. I\u2019ll try to do both until the seams show. Then I\u2019ll come make you promise not to get mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get mad,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can do it softly. Circus light mad. Not house fire mad. If you leave, we will have a good cry in the supply closet like civilized colleagues and then I\u2019ll throw you under the bus to new hires for a month and then I\u2019ll brag. I\u2019m proud of you, kid. I\u2019m proud in my bones. I\u2019ll deny it if anyone repeats me.\u201d\n\nHe nodded because to say thank you would have made the air too thin.\n\nBy nine the world had found him again with a different voice. The producer called with a list that sounded like a grocery run written by a person with an addiction to nouns. He said yes to the radio with the kind man who did not make him explain his family on air. He said no to the breakfast show that wanted him to make a five-minute pastry in a pan shaped like a heart. He said yes to the newspaper photographer who wanted to meet him in front of the blue tile wall on Vine and photograph his hands. He said maybe to a roundtable with the other finalists, because he wanted to sit beside Penelope and be a person with bread jokes in a public place.\n\nHe went to Sammi\u2019s caf\u00e9 and the chalkboard had a hasty crown drawn on it like a child had gotten ahold of chalk and joy. Sammi rang a bell he kept under the counter for people who over-tipped or brought good gossip. Patrons looked up and clapped because the bell told them to. The espresso this morning tasted like somebody had polished the machine. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you a deal,\u201d Sammi said, eyes bright, hair going in six directions because it had been excited too. \u201cPop-up here. Midnight buns. One week. I\u2019ll work the door so nobody assaults you. We\u2019ll call it Night Custard and pretend that\u2019s a business plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cNight Custard,\u201d he repeated, because he loved the way words could be stupid and perfect. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to get a bouncer who knows how to shoo grandmothers and men with opinions about rye.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a man with opinions about rye,\u201d Sammi said. \u201cHe is my landlord. He is also my father. He can\u2019t lift anything but his eyebrows. He can raise those so high it knocks a person over. Bring bread, boy. Bring sugared things that make people forgive their parents for an hour.\u201d\n\nThey chose a night like you choose a door. They drew a flier with a pen that bled. They told three people who would tell the entire city because the city wanted to be told. He left with his head full of the particular anxiety of abundance, the kind that made his teeth hum. He walked past the German restaurant where Penelope\u2019s bread lived and pressed his nose to the glass because a person who loves yeast is a dog sometimes. On the street he passed a man selling strawberries that were the wrong month and the wrong smell and could only be lies. He did not judge; he bought one because the red made his mouth thirsty. He ate it and let the sweet pretend. He tossed the stem in a trash can with the confidence of a man with transferable skills.\n\nBy late afternoon he had said enough words to strangers to need a small dark. He took his crown down from the table because Pickles had jumped up and knocked it with the disdain of a monarch disappointed by a cousin. He set it on the refrigerator where the magnet with Nana\u2019s recipe could look at it when she was bored. He pulled the recipe drawer open and ran his finger along cards that had acquired grease halos like saint pictures. He chose three that would not betray him to night air: the honey walnut cake, now a thing that belonged to the room as much as to him; a tart the color of a clean sunrise; and a roll that was not schnecken but would nod in a respectful direction. He made notes on a scrap of an old memo from the cleaning schedule because paper had layers like cake and he loved to stack their uses.\n\nIn the evening his phone rang with a name he did not expect and was not ready for. Cassidy. He took the call standing by the window because he had discovered that if he stood by the window while talking to famous people he could see the river and remember he had a body.\n\n\u201cYou were good television,\u201d she said without greeting. \u201cYou were better bakery. Those two aren\u2019t often the same. I\u2019m calling not to recruit you for a ridiculous thing where we make winners cook over an open fire in high winds, though that will happen and you should say no. I\u2019m calling because we have a series of off-air events that shuffle money into hands that need it. A fundraiser for the culinary program at a public school. A bake sale for a shelter that wants a new oven. If I paste your name to a flier, people who wouldn\u2019t come will. Will you stand in rooms and let people eat you in bites.\u201d\n\nHe smiled because the phrasing pleased him even as it made him wince. \u201cYes. Mostly. If I\u2019m allowed to bring a friend who will swat me when my face goes wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can bring a battalion,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, prepare yourself for men with clipboards who want to take you to Los Angeles. You are allowed to say no to them. They will interpret no as foreplay. Let me know if you need someone in a dress to say a legal phrase near their kneecaps.\u201d\n\nHe thought about his apartment and the crown on the refrigerator and the cat who had opinions about bells. \u201cI think what I want is to open a place called Night Custard for a week and let people eat sweet rolls at midnight until the police ask us to be reasonable. After that, I might stand in a school cafeteria and torch marshmallow for children who have never watched their sugar go glass.\u201d\n\nCassidy made a delighted noise that had nothing to do with cameras. \u201cThis is why you were good bakery,\u201d she said. \u201cSend me pictures of your pop-up. I\u2019ll post them and let the city pretend we are close. And Rory\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cBuy comfortable shoes. You are about to stand a lot more than you sit. And when you sit, people will sit on parts of you.\u201d\n\nAfter they hung up he sat on the floor again because the floor did not ask anything. He put his palm on the linoleum and felt, absurdly, like he could feel the river through the old wood and older concrete, like a pulse that would be there when he pulled his hand away. He had a memory unspool without asking permission: him at twelve, Nana\u2019s hand on his head, flour in the air like a weather system, her voice telling him in a soft imperative to leave it alone once it looked like a cloud. He said aloud, in his empty kitchen, to the crown and to the river and to the cat who might have his ear at the door, \u201cOkay,\u201d and meant it more ways than one.\n\nTwo days later Night Custard began as a joke and turned, by eleven-thirty, into a line that curled around the block like a sentence that wouldn\u2019t end. Sammi had bought rope stanchions from an event rental because he did not trust the civility of the city after ten p.m. He had given them codenames for when his voice had to reach only a certain distance: Rye, Lemon, Walnut, Bee. The chalkboard out front read: Midnight Rolls for Night Workers and Anyone Who Has Ever Held a Mop. Dee stood at the door with a stack of diner plates and the attitude of a woman who had removed children from danger and was not afraid to remove adults too.\n\nRory baked in the back with sleeves rolled up and hair tied with a strip of clean dish towel. He had borrowed a restaurant\u2019s convection oven that sang in a key he did not know. He rolled dough while Sammi\u2019s espresso machine flared like gossip. Steam clung to his neck; flour flourished on his forearms in pale smudges. He plated, he brushed, he drizzled honey with the small meanness you keep for good things. Every third person who received a roll told him a story about a grandmother, and every story bent the same way at the end, toward a kitchen and a light and a person you couldn\u2019t keep.\n\nAt one, the firefighters from the station down the block came in with the polite swagger that belonged to men and women who owned helmets. They bought a dozen and carried them like they were relics. At one-thirty, a woman in scrubs with blood on her shoe and glitter in her hair from some child\u2019s birthday came and ordered two, one to eat there and one to sneak into a fridge labeled Nurses. At two, three boys who had no business being awake and would not be told otherwise came in and took pictures of their faces behind the rolls until Sammi took their phones and said, \u201cEat now. Photograph later. There are rules in a place like this. They are all about sugar.\u201d\n\nDee wandered behind the counter and bumped him with her hip. \u201cYou\u2019re a menace,\u201d she said, looking pleased and exhausted. \u201cThe city is lit like a birthday and you did that little bit. Do not let it go to your head or I\u2019ll knock it out with a tray.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen do I sleep,\u201d he asked, not really asking.\n\n\u201cWhen you remember you have a bed,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t get bouncy. Bouncy is for children. You are a steady man with a crown on his refrigerator. Keep your ankles under you. Watch your laces. Pickles is going to trip you on purpose because he resents your new fame.\u201d\n\nAt three, the beekeeper arrived with her hat like an eclipse and a canvas bag that had the sort of mysterious weight that said emergency. She took off the hat like a burden and put it on a chair and ate with the intensity of a person who had earned anything she wanted to want. After her second roll she put two jars on the counter like an offering. \u201cThe bees approve,\u201d she said around a mouthful. \u201cThey want to know if you\u2019ll keep using them. Don\u2019t answer. Just keep buying jars from a woman with a hat and I\u2019ll read that as yes.\u201d\n\nAt four, the line thinned as the night did that thing it does right before morning, the breathing out, the preparation to hand the day to day. Sammi counted cash with his tongue in his cheek. The espresso machine sighed like an animal heading for bed. Rory cleaned his station as if the cameras were watching and were also kind. He wrapped the last roll of the night for a boy asleep at a table who had come with his mother and had put his head down and dreamed while the room made a sound he would remember as a flavor.\n\nWhen he stepped outside to feel the five o\u2019clock on his cheeks, there was a shape outlined against the glass. The brick-colored cat sat on Sammi\u2019s window ledge with his paws tucked into his chest, his bell a weight on his collar, his eyes like slits that still saw. Smee looked at Rory and Rory looked at Smee and the air made a truce. The cat jumped down with a view toward entropy and trotted away, tail up, like a prince who had inspected a new province and found it acceptable.\n\nHe went home with his apron in a bag and flour in his eyebrows and the loose proud ache that only stands in your legs when you have been useful for hours on end. In his hallway he heard Mrs. Kline snoring like a small saw. Pickles lay on his back with his stomach out and his eyes closed, a seduction and a trap. Rory stepped carefully because he loved his ankles. In his kitchen, the crown on the refrigerator had become a normal object, the way even remarkable things do when you keep them near. He set his palms on the table not in prayer but in the habit of it.\n\nSometime later, when he did sleep, the dream he had was not one of disaster. He dreamed he stood on the Suspension Bridge and the river below was a loaf that had risen perfectly, a brown you only get by not opening the oven too soon. He walked across as if crossing a kitchen and on the other side there was a lamp lit like a good joke, and a woman with flour on her cheek who told him, in a voice that was his too, that he had measured enough for today. She handed him a towel and he dried his hands and woke with the tang of lemon in his mouth, and for once, for a long second that felt like the length of a loaf cooling, he did not scramble for the next thing. He lay there and let his breath do what it had learned. Outside, the river went about its business and the sun came up and the city thought, why not, and began again.Chapter 6\n\nBy the end of the week the crown stopped being a joke and became an object that caught dust like anything else. It sat on the refrigerator and made the humming of the motor feel ceremonial, which was useless and also a little funny. He found himself drying his hands on a towel and then glancing up at it as if it might be taking notes, as if it might press itself into the soft of his day and leave an imprint he would have to honor. He went to work because work asked in the same steady voice it always had. He pushed the cart and mopped the path light took, and Dee pretended not to watch him for cracks in his attention like a mason testing a new wall with his knuckles. Night Custard happened in three more installments without anyone getting arrested, which Sammi declared a miracle, and which Rory declared an inevitability if you fed a city sugar with respect and some kind of music. His phone began to behave like a pot near a boil; it made small noises and little vibrations and tried to keep him running. He answered what felt human and gave himself up to the slow rejection of the rest, deleting offers for shows with titles like Dough Or Dare and politely saying no to a documentary that wanted to catch him sleeping because that would be raw.\n\nThere were practicalities to answer that did not care whether you were lit by stage lights. Health, safety, permits, the holy trinity of the nervous and righteous. A man with a clipboard and the startling eyelashes of a calf appeared during Night Custard number four and asked to see documentation and then, because Sammi charmed him into a seat with a roll and a latte he did not want, asked if Rory had thought of a permanent kitchen. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this forever,\u201d the man said, chewing like a person who knew pleasure and had agreed to like this too. \u201cPop-ups are like those men who tell you they are between things. The city will get jealous if you flirt with it and then refuse to say yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetween things is a place,\u201d Rory said, because he had occupied it for the length of several apartments. \u201cBut yes. I am thinking about a room I can sweep and lock and leave flour in without having to apologize to espresso fans.\u201d\n\n\u201cFind a hood system that doesn\u2019t sound like a rock band,\u201d the man said, rising with a sigh. \u201cAnd put your sink where a tired person will forgive it. I like you. I will like you better on paper.\u201d\n\nRory did not tell him that paper had been imagining him in rooms for years. He told him he would consider a hood devoutly and then sent a text to Penelope because she was a person who owned proofs and also proofing cabinets. She wrote back with a picture of a walk-in cooler that had outlived at least one marriage and a caption that said, Come look at our old annex kitchen before the landlord repurposes it into artisanal axe-throwing. He tucked that invitation into the same pocket where he had tucked every invitation that felt like a door.\n\nWhen he wasn\u2019t arranging yeast in bowls at midnight or aligning trash bags like uniforms at four a.m., he walked. He made little loops of city the way a person makes loops of yarn while trying to remember a story their grandmother told once and never again. On one of those walks he found a narrow space on Twelfth, a former shoe repair store whose windows arched like eyebrows and whose floor, visible through the dusty glass, was a patchwork of tile and plywood that looked like it had been mended with love and impatience. The For Lease sign had a number with a name under it: W. D. Engel & Sons, which was either a dynasty or a hopeful fiction. He called and got a woman who said her name like a formula, the efficiency of four generations condensed into a vowel. \u201cYou can look at it on Tuesday,\u201d she said, after he admitted that his business plan was a napkin and his capital a collection of friends and a jar of honey. \u201cBring a flashlight. The light switches are decorative for now.\u201d\n\nHe brought Dee because he did not do new rooms without her if he could help it. She walked into the dim and sniffed the air like a dog in a hallway. \u201cDry,\u201d she said, tapping the wall with her knuckles. \u201cGood bones. Bad outlets. There\u2019s a slope to the floor near the back that will make you swear when you are balancing a sheet pan full of anything. It smells like leather and old glue. That\u2019s not a bad thing for the first year of a place. It\u2019s got discipline built in.\u201d\n\nThe landlord\u2019s granddaughter arrived with keys and a binder that looked heavier than some of the tenants. She looked at Rory\u2019s crown on the refrigerator in his photos and did not mention it, which made him like her a little. \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate on rent,\u201d she said, flipping to a page that revealed numbers that made his stomach do the math in exclamation points. \u201cBut we negotiate on months before rent when the landlord is feeling fatherly and believes in a thing. Do you have a thing that can make a man in suspenders loosen them.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d Rory said, and set the baker\u2019s dozen of schnecken on the counter as if he had practiced this and, in a way, had. \u201cAnd an idea. Midnight buns for people who sweep, for people who deliver, for people who pour, for people who shut off the lights and then have to turn around and turn them on again.\u201d\n\nThe woman took a roll and examined it the way a person examines a small piece of jewelry. She bit and her eyes did the thing eyes do when the mathematician inside them sets down a pencil. \u201cSuspender man is my father,\u201d she said, when she had swallowed. \u201cHe has strong opinions about butter and about young people being lazy which I don\u2019t share. He will say this is too sweet. I will tell him he is at war with joy. He will then compromise because my child calls him Honey Bear and he goes soft for that kind of nonsense. Finish cleaning your cabinets this week. We\u2019ll talk.\u201d\n\nIt was progress that felt like being handed a bridge in pieces and a glue gun. He wrote a list that looked like a parade: quotes for hoods, PLC-covered painters versus the friend who would do it for half a cake, plumbing men, electrician women, industrial shelves with a patience that almost made you forgive their ugliness. He stuck the list to the wall with tape he would regret later and then left the space to breathe because he had seen kitchens die when men loved them too loudly before they were ready.\n\nIn between the logistics he went to the school on the West Side because Cassidy asked him to and because she promised him a cafeteria that smelled like corn and teenage soap. The culinary program\u2019s teacher had a voice like a coach and the hair of a person who had chosen not to fight their curls anymore. She stood him up in front of a dozen kids who hid their nervousness in hoods and eyeliner and the practiced shrug of a person who has decided they will not clap for a man with a crown they didn\u2019t ask for. He told them about dough in the bakery voice that he used when he wanted to quell panic and he told them about custodial work in the voice he used when he wanted to raise attention. He said flour and butter and sugar and eggs and saw a boy in the back lift his head like those four words were four notes from a song his mother had sung. They made pretzels with too much salt and a dough that stuck stubborn in the bends until he coaxed the kids to let it be ugly for a minute and then trust their own hands. The girl with the eyeliner asked him if television was fake and he told her it was true with wardrobe. He watched two of the boys stand a little taller when he told them his wrists had learned this long after his mouth did. No one swooned and no one pretended to; they put the pretzels in brown paper bags and walked back to classes like you walk out of a church, eyes squinting at the light as if it will charge a fee.\n\nOn the way out he passed a display case with trophies behind glass and the dust of decades on top. The janitor\u2019s cart leaned against the wall outside the principal\u2019s office like a parked car, and the man pushing it had the posture of someone who remembered his body after the first hour and didn\u2019t need to be reminded again. Rory stopped and said the thing he always said to men and women whose hands made it possible for people to pretend things were clean by magic. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he said. \u201cLooks like a long one.\u201d The man glanced at his shoes, looked up to Rory\u2019s face, then down to the key ring on his belt and shook it once like a bell. \u201cIsn\u2019t it always,\u201d he said, smiling in a plain way that made their feet choose the same rhythm for a second. Cassidy caught up to him at the door and tapped his shoulder with a little stack of thank-you notes printed on paper that still smelled like hot toner. \u201cKeep these,\u201d she said, as if he had tried to hand them back. \u201cThe city is writing you small love letters. Don\u2019t get greedy, but don\u2019t throw them away.\u201d\n\nHe saw his mother three times in two weeks and every time she arrived less winded by the idea. The first time they met her on Lena\u2019s porch, perched on a plastic chair that wheezed when she shifted. He handed her a plate and she pretended not to apologize to it, as if plates kept tallies. The second time she showed up at Night Custard at ten fifty-five with a man from the bowling alley who had known him since he had been shorter than a mop. \u201cWe are old,\u201d she announced to the room, which had not asked and clapped anyway, \u201cand we want sugar.\u201d He saw the way she glanced at the crown pinned to a corkboard like a butterfly, how her mouth threatened to turn down and then changed its mind. The third time she knocked on his apartment door at four in the afternoon with a bag of groceries and a handful of recipes that had traveled folded in someone else\u2019s purse long enough to matter. She said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to let me in,\u201d and then entered anyway because in their family a threshold was a suggestion like a speed limit. They made meatloaf that fought them and green beans that refused to take on personality, and they ate, knees touching the coffee table, plates on bare wood, letting the television talk for them until it didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter she left, he stood in his kitchen with his hands wet and thought about how forgiveness was like honey in that it did not solve bread but made it easier to finish. He did not think the word forgive out loud because it would have tried to put itself into his mouth with sticky hands. He sent Lena a picture of the sink and the plates leaning like tired men on each other. She wrote back a string of hearts and a picture of their mother asleep in an armchair with a new softness around the mouth, the kind babies get when they give up crying for a history they don\u2019t know how to hold.\n\nOn a Saturday that held itself like it had been taught manners, the beekeeper called him and said, in the flat panicked voice of a person who had taught themselves calm, \u201cThe bees are leaving.\u201d He arrived in a rapid walk that would have been a run a year ago and saw a cloud that was not cloud. The air in front of the bee boxes shivered and rewrote itself and then moved, a collective decision that made the hair on his arms try to salute. The woman stood with a cardboard box and a white sheet like a bride at a farm wedding. \u201cThey do this,\u201d she said, in case he thought he was about to lose a friend. \u201cThey find a queen and make a traveling house. They\u2019ll choose a branch. Then we have to convince them they meant to land in this box.\u201d\n\nHe was not a man to argue with insects with better choreography than his. He held the sheet the way she wanted and then kneeled when she told him to, and they moved like a duo that had not rehearsed but had a talent for not stepping on each other\u2019s feet. The bees settled in a curly cluster on a low branch that looked like an ornament, like someone had hung a living purse from the tree for lack of imagination. The beekeeper spoke to them in a tone that was half hymn and half gossip, and Rory found himself holding his breath at intervals as if not to jostle their choices. When the box was under the branch and the sheet was less sheet than stage, the woman shook the branch with a vigor that would have scattered lesser creatures. The bees fell in a mass that did not hit like water but like a sack filled with a liquid that remembered air. They gathered again and spilled again and then, as if remembering their queen\u2019s perfume, moved their small bodies into a tide heading down. He felt one knock against his wrist and he thought of all the kitchens he had made into something else and he imagined the bees looking at him with eyes that did not need advice and said, without words, We know how to make something out of sugar and need with our bodies. It was three minutes and also an afternoon. When the lid was on and the holes were open and the noise changed register the beekeeper let out a breath that paid off several old debts. \u201cThat\u2019s how you do it,\u201d she said, leaning against his shoulder like a sister. \u201cThat\u2019s how you move a crowd without yelling.\u201d\n\nHe took the feeling back to the Twelfth Street space and set it on a shelf like a jar of spice. He and Sammi measured the counters with a tape that would not stay put, and he and Dee marked the walls with blue painter\u2019s tape where the ovens would live and where the sinks would have to insist. He signed a paper with the granddaughter and her father and got their name wrong and they forgave him because his hand kept shaking. He spent a long morning with a plumber named Cherise who said, without looking up from the maw of a pipe, \u201cDo not let tile men tell you that grout is sealant. Grout is toothpaste. It gets dirty and cries.\u201d He put in an order for sheet pans that made him feel as if he either were planning a party for a town or had decided to take up a sport in which aluminum was the primary opponent. He stood at the back door and saw the narrow alley and the part of the sky that was his and the sound of the dumpsters rolling like ships in harbor, and he had to hold his breath until his lungs forgave his heart.\n\nIt was about then that the article came out, because if there is joy there must be a piece of paper attached that makes it official. The paper put his face above a headline that made him want to crawl into Dee\u2019s supply closet and not come out until the ink flaked off. The writer was better than the headline, and had the grace to ask him about the mops before the ovens. She sat with him while he made dough and did not pretend to know what the words meant when he talked about crumb structure and she wrote down Nana with the apostrophe he put in it when he was tired. The photographs did not make him look like a deer, which he appreciated, and one of them caught his hands in a blur that looked like rehearsal for flight. The part he liked best surprised him: a picture of Dee in a hallway, her hand on a plant like she was telling it a secret and the plant was smarter than the people who had left their signatures on a glass wall. The caption called her his mentor and she snorted when she saw it and then kept the paper under the bed like girls keep magazines about hair and possibility.\n\nThe article made the line at Night Custard longer and a little shinier. It brought a consultant with white teeth and no socks who wanted to give him money in exchange for his name on fifty boxes in cities that did not have this river and this weather and this Dee. It brought a couple from Indian Hill who wanted to \u201ccurate\u201d him into a lifestyle brand with bees on the label and a story about walnuts that felt like a poem about someone else\u2019s grandfather. It brought a man who had known his father and whose eyebrows tried to warn him before his mouth did, and it brought a woman with a blog who took pictures of her food like a mother who did not trust her babysitter. He smiled until his mouth asked for a reprieve, and then he went to the back and leaned his head against the cool side of the walk-in and begged the metal to teach him how to be cold in a kind way.\n\nThrough all of it, the work was itself. He turned out rolls at midnight until his arms discovered a new kind of fatigue that felt like a song you learn without sheet music. He wiped counters with the muscle memory of a monk in a kitchen that had to be clean by dawn. He took his crown to a fundraiser at a vocational school on the East Side and raised his torch over a tray of meringue while a boy told him he could not stop burning sugar because it looked like magic he could control. He stood in a church basement and served tart to a line of men who would not make eye contact and then did because he said their names like a spell. He took a day off because Dee told him to and found himself at the river at eight in the morning watching a barge push against the current like a man who will not be told no by a stubborn cupboard, and he pressed his palms to the cold metal railing and breathed through his mouth like a swimmer.\n\nThe week the hood went in he fought with the electrician about ducts and with the inspector about hand-washing signs and with his own brain about whether butter was a reason to lose sleep. He went to the German restaurant early and stood in the annex with Penelope and watched steam pour from the dishwasher like a genie that had decided to bless plates. She put an arm around his shoulder in the brother way she had and told him to ask for help before he cried into his dough, and he told her he did not cry into dough, he cried into baguettes because it made the crust more honest. They ate bread off a knife and she sent him back out with a basket of pretzels for the crew and a promise to show him how to make the starter behave if it started acting like a teenager.\n\nOn a Tuesday when the work had been a hum and not a shout, Mrs. Kline cornered him on the stairs with an expression on her face that reminded him of the time she had accused the mailman of stealing her magazine, which had in fact fallen under her couch and been stuck there with a raisin. \u201cA man came,\u201d she said, flipping a hand like a page. \u201cHe asked if you live here. I said maybe. He left a packet with papers inside that are ridiculous because they say partnership and they mean contract and they mention a number that would make the cat faint.\u201d She held the envelope away from her as if it might be contagious. \u201cI hid it under your mat because if I put it inside you\u2019d know where it was and then you\u2019d do something you\u2019d have to hire me to forgive you for.\u201d\n\nHe took the envelope and felt the weight of it do a little dance with his stomach. He opened it at his table and read words that tried to turn him into trademark and then into product, words that asked whether he could remove the part of him that burned his fingertips and surrender it to a label. He ran a finger down the page and looked at the margin left by the printer and felt an old loyalty twitch. He set it aside because he had to, and he pulled out flour because flour did not negotiate. He made a cake he did not need because sometimes baking was a way of telling the room you will not leave.\n\nKitchens were loud when you were alone in them. The hood hummed, the mixer thumped its gallop, the oven gasped and softened into a good breath, the water at the three-bay sink slurred as it found drains that had not yet learned him. He wanted to call Dee and then did not, because he wanted the decision to be quiet until it had shape. He wanted to call Cassidy and ask how she had stayed human when cameras insisted on pinning her to a wall, and then he did not because he knew she would answer with a joke that would act like a stitch when he needed something less gentle. He did call Lena, and she answered with the sound of wind because she was driving and would not be told otherwise. He read her the numbers and she whistled and then told him to light the paper on fire as a ritual, the way their grandmother had burned her last husband\u2019s hat on a grill as a goodbye to something none of them could name. \u201cYou are allowed to be big,\u201d she said, and her voice was not a car anymore. \u201cYou are not required to be enormous. Enormous makes rooms grow teeth.\u201d\n\nHe told Dee after their second building of the night that he might be leaving the cart, and he watched her face the way men at the track watched the horse that had almost fallen last race. She nodded as if her head had been steadied by a kind hand. \u201cI knew before you did,\u201d she said, because she was not modest. \u201cOf course I did. You\u2019ve been looking at walls like they are asking you to hang shelves for other people. You can\u2019t leave badly. That\u2019s the only thing. You do not ghost a floor. You say goodbye to the cupboard and the mop sink and the poor plant that I have told so many truths to. You are allowed to cry in here where no one will make you into a GIF. But do not think I will let you walk out carrying all the boxes at once to prove something to someone who is not in the room.\u201d\n\nHe did not cry then, because he was greedy and wanted to save the good crying for a time when he could do it in a place with a lock. He nodded and wiped a nonexistent streak on the glass in front of them and put the rag back in the caddy in its spot because goodbyes are made of that kind of thing. He told the plant the news, because he had learned there were economies of ritual, and he heard Dee snort behind him and also sniff quietly. They went down to the lobby where the dawn put its confidence on and he looked at the sticker on the bin that said Team Queen City Clean and he smoothed the corners, which had lifted just enough to catch worry. He let his thumb press the edge back down and knew as soon as it held that he had done the thing he could do to make the moment presentable.\n\nOpening a place is a way of admitting that your private is willing to be borrowed. The first night the doors were not really doors yet; they were sheets of plastic that the contractor insisted would keep dust out and which in fact taught it how to enter in a more sophisticated fashion. The ovens came like medieval animals on dollies, ancient and dignified and easily insulted if handled badly. The first time they lit, the sound made him think of boats and lungs. Sammi had insisted on painting the front the color of old cream, which looked like nothing much until the sign went up and then looked like the correct decision your hands had been leading your mouth to all along. They hung a simple sign, which Lena praised and their mother called stingy, and Dee said, \u201cUnder-promise, over-deliver,\u201d while writing in Sharpie under the register, Do not run a tab for men who say they know my cousin.\n\nHe hired two people because two felt like a marriage and three a household. One was a girl from the school whose eyeliner now made statements rather than excuses; she showed up early and rearranged spoons like it was her religion. The other was a man who had moved to the city for a person and had been left by that person with a bed and a love of cinnamon and a need. The papers asked him if he would franchise and he said he would rather learn how not to burn toasted nuts on days when his mother had called, and then laughed until they were forced to print the laugh as a decision. He went to sleep at odd angles and at odd times, and if he dreamed, he did not always remember the narrative when he woke.\n\nOn the morning that was the day before opening, he woke to Pickles sitting on his chest in a perfect loaf, his bell a judgment and a mercy. The cat stared at his eyelids until they gave up. He could have sworn the cat knew; he could have sworn the animal had an opinion about hoods and permits and banners and men who wanted to put his rolls in airports. He scratched the stripe between the cat\u2019s eyes and suffered the slap of a tail and laughed even as the weight made his breathing personal. The street outside had already given itself to trucks and bread smells, and when he cracked the window he could hear someone down the block arguing with a pallet jack. He made coffee he would not drink, because the smell was more useful than the liquid right now, and he stood in the rectangle of the kitchen floor that seemed to love him best and set his plans down in a row. He had lists that said butter and lists that said exit routes and lists that reminded him to breathe when the first thing burned, because the first thing burned if only to remind everyone what heat could do.\n\nHe walked to the shop through the small regular noises of day starting up, the dog nails on sidewalk, the wheel hum, the woman who ran and performed a complicated negotiation with her hair tie and her desire to let the morning be messy. The alley behind the store smelled faintly of onions from the restaurant two over, and he made a mental note to learn that schedule because there were smells that fought and there were smells that danced, and onions would try to lead. He unlocked the door and breathed the industrial wood of prep tables that had not yet learned their stories. He set his hand flat on the new counter as if it were a fevered child. The crown on the refrigeration unit looked absurd, which was comforting. He turned on the oven and listened for the first cough that would announce that the day had started, and when it came it was not theatrical, it was small and ready, which he took as an omen better than birds.\n\nHe thought of Nana then, in a way that was less elegy and more instruction. He could almost hear her scold the oven for being too modern and drag the table closer to a window because light was free and had to be used. He could almost feel the weight of her palm between his shoulders, that steadying push that was also a challenge. He mixed dough and he told the room not to fuss, which made the room laugh in the way new rooms do when they are trying to please. When the first tray went in he closed the door as if he were putting a letter in a slot and learned, in that second again, that every oven is a person. He began frosting, the ermine glossy as an apology made at the right time, and he let the icing tell him when it was enough. He was not going to do a sugar crown the first day; he would not antagonize humidity until he and humidity had made a truce in front of this room\u2019s audience.\n\nSammi arrived with a box of single-stem flowers that had defied the gas station they came from. He set them into old ginger beer bottles with the concentration of a surgeon. \u201cWe look like we are pretending to be French, which is on brand for me and a sin in your grandmother\u2019s church,\u201d he said, fanning himself with the health department permit in a way that would make the inspector find him from miles away. Dee came with a mop because no matter how much you intend to begin in triumph, you begin in water. She told him not to sign anything placed in front of him by a person whose jacket cost more than his oven and then kissed his cheek with a briskness that dared the day to debate her. Lena appeared with a box of napkins she had stolen from a deli that would not miss them, and his mother slid in at the side door with a Tupperware of deviled eggs that she insisted had to be placed behind the register as emergency morale. Penelope sent a text that said, I\u2019m outside with bread because you will forget to eat inside your own place, and Cassidy sent a picture of a city skyline with a crown drawn in like a girl writing in a geometry book.\n\nAt ten fifty-nine they stood in a loose cluster that felt less like a staff and more like a family who has decided not to discuss who has the worst uncle. At eleven the door swung inward, and the bell\u2014not a cute one, a solid one that sounded like the word yes\u2014told the room it had changed. The first customer was the janitor from the school, who had come with his cart and an expression that made his eyebrows into bridges. He ordered one of everything and ten of the rolls and stood with his tray at the end of the counter because the generosity of choice had stunned him for a second. The second was the health inspector with the eyelashes and a date in a dress who rolled her eyes at him and told him not to make the man work today because he was not on shift. The third was the beekeeper without her hat, which was like seeing a church without its roof for a second and recognizing it anyway. The fourth was a woman who had never liked him and had nonetheless come to tell him she was proud, which he took as the prize in everything.\n\nThe room filled and then softened, the way bread does when it hits the right heat. There was a moment when the line was long enough for him to feel the corner of panic and he saw it and bowed to it and then looked past it the way you see the river and look up to the bridge because if you stare at the water too long you will begin to hear old stories tell themselves too loudly. He slid trays in and out with a rhythm he had studied for with his body. He spoke to the girl with the eyeliner with his eyes when he needed a plate and she got him the plate without the distorted theater of a cry. He burned the corners of one pan and fed that pan to the back door raccoon who had been holding his little hands together as if in prayer outside the alley and whose gratitude would be repaid by a knocked-over trash can on a night when they were tired. He cut slices of cake with a knife he warmed under hot water because a cold blade had\u2014today, at least\u2014decided to pull the crumb badly.\n\nThe first lull came at one-thirty and fell like a good seat. He wiped, because wiping was the thing you did when silence arrived even in a happy room. He looked at the crown and it did not look like a dare anymore. It looked like a detail in a picture you can point at later when someone who wasn\u2019t there demands proof. A shadow moved against the glass and a shape hopped into the window, tail a punctuation mark. Smee stared in with his critic\u2019s stare and made a small sound in his throat that meant either contempt or approval depending on your own need. Pickles, whose bell had preceded him like trumpets, sprang up onto the chair near the door with a spiral that would have impressed a choir director. The two cats stared at each other over the heads of men who did not notice and one woman who did and took a photograph without thinking whether the internet needed it. Smee flicked an ear; Pickles flicked his entire posterior; the truce held because both were in the habit of being allowed to have opinions and neither wished to knock a plate off a table when honey was within smacking distance.\n\nWhen he finally let himself sit, it was on a milk crate behind the counter and for a time that could be measured by a door swing and a breath. He felt the tired come into his bones as a friend, the kind that takes your shoes off without asking and does not try to talk. He heard the river from here even though he could not hear the river from here, the way you hear a clock that is not in the room because your wrist remembers. The girl with the eyeliner slid him a plate with a deviled egg because she had learned fast and because she liked to watch him wince at the way their mother used too much paprika. Sammi waved a towel like a flag at a fly that had been trying to upstage the tart. Dee reached under the counter and held his hand for half a breath because she was a person who was not ashamed of touching when touching steadied the world.\n\nIt would be a long afternoon and a longer week. It would be a series of mornings that began at quiet and turned into the particular clatter of knives talking to plates and names talking to mouths. It would be checks and signatures and a scrape from a pan he would feel in his thumb for days. It would be the slow amendment of himself to the room, of the room to himself. It would be men with clipboards forgiven and men with clipboards not invited back. It would be Mrs. Kline coming in to stand at the door and say, loudly enough for the raccoon to learn manners, \u201cWell, will you look at that, a place that will fail if you don\u2019t give that custard to people who look like me. Hand over the secret,\u201d followed by the utter silence of him refusing except with a fork and plate. It would be seeing his mother at a table with a woman he did not know without fear, just curiosity that would be allowed to be answered in the slow way. It would be learning which corner of the counter was where sad news tended to be delivered and which corner made people tell the truth about their feet. It would be a hundred little answers to the question of how to be a person whose hands made something that vanished only to be asked for again, which is what love looks like if you put it on a schedule.\n\nNear closing, as the last summer light tilted itself into the windows and made the sugar on the tart glow in a way that was a cheap effect and also perfect, he stepped outside with a last tray of rolls for the crew that had assembled around this room the way bees assemble around a story. The air moved on his face like an apology for something it had not done. Across the street the blue tile wall on Vine took the evening and handed it back brighter. A bus rolled by with a poster for a show he had not agreed to be on yet, and the driver gave him a little salute like a fellow worker and he returned it like a man who knew which way his cap faced. He could smell the river the way you smell a kitchen when you round the corner of home. He tucked his chin, smiled because he hadn\u2019t earned not to, and went back inside to take one more pan from the oven before it decided to remind him that heat had two hands.Chapter 9\n\nHe saved his last night for a Tuesday because Tuesdays had always met him halfway. Fridays strutted, Mondays sulked, Wednesdays cracked in the middle like bread that forgot its steam, but Tuesdays held their spine and didn\u2019t ask for applause. He told Dee a week ahead and she did not tell him she had known since the night his face had started looking past the corners of rooms to the places where ovens might go. She simply wrote his shift in black pen and then drew a small crown next to his name as if a child had borrowed her hand for a second. He felt the knowledge in his knuckles every time he wrung the mop, the way grief lives in the same bone as weather.\n\nThe building accepted the ritual because buildings are religious creatures if you treat them long enough like sanctuaries. They started at the top, because they always started at the top, and rode the elevator with the polite boredom of people who had memorized the coughs of its cables. The key ring on his belt felt heavier, not with metal, but with the anticipation of removal. Dee moved quick and then not, the way she always did when she was making a point to a clock. When they hit the eleventh floor she pressed her palm to the wall outside the conference room as if checking it for fever and said, \u201cYou tell the wall thank you,\u201d like he was slow. \u201cDon\u2019t make me raise you wrong at the end.\u201d\n\nThey worked for forty minutes without commentary, because some gratitude only counts if you don\u2019t say it over the work. He wiped the handprints off the glass partitions with a motion he had taught a hundred times to people who preferred circles and streaks; he ran the vacuum in the straight lanes that had satisfied him when other things refused to. He found the office plant that had spoken all their secrets back to them and touched its pot like a shoulder. Dee stood behind him with her hip jutted and her head cocked and said, \u201cNow you\u2019ve made it weird,\u201d and then she put two fingers on one yellowing leaf and stroked it with a tenderness she saved for machine parts and living things she did not intend to admit she needed.\n\nAt three, because habit is ceremony, they stood at the north windows and looked out. The river had laid itself flat to appease the thunderheads should they arrive. Covington had let five people turn on kitchen lightbulbs in the last ten minutes; the pattern was nothing and also fate. A barge slid under the Roebling with the long patience of a family story. He could see, faint white at the curve of the sky above Newport, the flare of heat lightning that announced summer\u2019s temper. He told himself, and he told the glass, and he told the woman beside him without saying it out loud, that a person could love two things in a way that didn\u2019t ask either to shrink. He had loved these halls. He had loved these corners that had learned his shoulder. He would love a room with flour in its cracks. He would love them both until the part in him that could not be split objected.\n\nThey did the last bathroom like priests with a relic. Dee made him re-do two sinks he had done with nerves instead of attention and he did not sigh. When they had hung the mops to drip and leaned the brooms in their assigned angles and refilled the paper towel caddies with the muscle memory of monks binding books, he took his keys off his belt. He set them on the shelf in the supply closet where the dust made everyone honest. He put his thumb on the Team Queen City Clean sticker to smooth its unruly corner and it stayed; he felt that small success like a blessing. Dee stood with her hands in her back pockets, which made her look like a foreman and a mother, and looked everywhere but at his hands.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll come back to walk the hall with me when the building forgets how good it can look,\u201d she said, and it wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cYou\u2019ll call me if anyone talks to you like a magazine and I will put on shoes and go to their office and water their plant with their coffee. Don\u2019t get soft. Don\u2019t get mean. Those are the only rules I care about. And don\u2019t let anyone tell you clean floors don\u2019t matter because their shoes are expensive.\u201d\n\nHe said okay to all of it. He said okay to the things she hadn\u2019t named, the stranded rituals, the jokes that only worked at four-thirty when the elevator made its haunted sound. They hugged because they were not showy people and because sometimes you hug to keep your chest from coming apart in a dry way. In the manager\u2019s office, whose little waterfall still muttered managerial wisdom to no one, he signed the form that made it official and shook hands with a man who called him valued and mispronounced his last name in a way that would have been charming from a grandmother and was not from a manager. Dee took his keys and slipped them onto her belt with a motion that honored the weight. \u201cI\u2019ll hold them until your hand stops reaching for your hip when you leave rooms,\u201d she said, and they both laughed and both coughed and then both laughed again because it had been a long time since coughing wasn\u2019t scary.\n\nThe bakery met him with flour talk. He stepped through the door and felt the air greet him the way a dog recognizes one body\u2019s footstep from the thousand that pass. The ovens had learned his moods and, in their grumbling way, approved of big ones because it gave them something to do. The girl with the eyeliner had written a quote on the prep board from the big-handed baker about not letting anyone put their voice in your wrist and added, in a different color, a heart she pretended didn\u2019t belong to her. The man who made cinnamon smell like a decision had stacked trays with the hushed efficiency of a person who had been told once that he made too much noise in the kitchen and had saved the critique for a rainy day.\n\nHe could feel the storm in the way sugar poured. It clumped just slightly, reluctant to leave itself for air. Outside, the sky was a bruise with a soft middle. The beekeeper arrived with a hat that could have blocked artillery and news that arrived in the same tone she used for recipes and death. \u201cMites,\u201d she said, and let the word walk around the room, stepping on flour with military boots. \u201cI lost a third this week. I\u2019m not crying because I have reached the stage of grief where rage makes itself useful. Will you take a box on your roof.\u201d She held up her chin the way people do when they don\u2019t want to be told no because the word might break something internal they do not have parts to replace just now.\n\nHe thought of permits and health inspectors with eyelashes and a landlord\u2019s granddaughter who saw the city like a ledger and also like a novel. He thought of honey moving through a kitchen as if sweetness were a public utility. He thought of his grandmother calling bees ladies and blessing them when they bumped into her ear. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, because sometimes the mouth had to outrun the brain if you wanted to behave like the person you intended to become. \u201cWe\u2019ll make friends with the landlord\u2019s father by pretending it was his idea. I\u2019ll bring him a roll and a napkin and ask whether he remembers what bees tasted like when he was small. If he says no, I\u2019ll say yes for him and he\u2019ll agree because nostalgia is the cheapest spice.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore the storm works its way into the part of their bodies that make decisions. We\u2019ll start them small. You\u2019ll hear them from your bed if you leave the window open. That\u2019s not a warning. That\u2019s a lullaby. Also, the candles.\u201d She opened her bag like a magician with practical training and set two rows of beeswax cylinders on the counter, pouring the light out in another form. \u201cTake them. The electricity will do that thing men do\u2014a disappearing act and an apology only half meant. Burn these and pretend you planned romance.\u201d\n\nHe did the prep with the attention he had learned to replace panic. He weighed flour the way you weigh choices when you are trying to love one person without leaving another. Honey loosened on the stove and smelled like other people\u2019s breakfasts. He had three doughs going because the city had been coming for the midnight buns with a hunger that was less novelty and more recognition. Sammi arrived with the storm in his hair and a camping stove he swore would not kill anyone. \u201cMy father says he used this in 1978 to make scrapple when the whole neighborhood lost its mind,\u201d he announced, setting it up on a stainless-steel table with the adoration men save for machines that saved them once. \u201cWe\u2019ll make coffee on it when the lights go and call it heritage.\u201d\n\nAt six the day went gray and humid, the sort of air that sat on your chest and asked rude questions. The first thunder rolled like barrels. People came in anyway because sugar is a thing people make a pact with and storms do not interrupt ceremonies, they accompany. The girl with the eyeliner took orders with the ability to watch two things and smile at a third. He saw the janitor from the school in line with a teenager in a hoodie who looked at the room like it owed him money and then, when he bit into the roll, like he was owed nothing and had been handed a gift anyway. Penelope stuck her face in the back door like a weather report and yelled over the hood\u2019s hum, \u201cMy oven\u2019s got gas and a stubborn streak; you lose your lights, bring dough to me,\u201d and then she left because bread waited for no pronouncement.\n\nThe storm arrived like anger finally deciding to be useful. Rain hit the windows flat, urgent, as if someone had put their hands to the glass and clapped. The bell on the door sounded busy and brave, because the people of his city knew how to time their runs between the drops. The first flicker from the bulbs made the room hold its breath and then pretend it hadn\u2019t. The second took the sound down a notch but left the ovens frowning and the mixer muttering. The third turned everything to a soft-dark that was somehow theatrical and also, immediately, practical.\n\nDee was up from the basement level of her other life in one minute and thirty seconds because she had smelled it from blocks away. She carried a battery lantern under one arm and a roll of gaffer tape in her teeth like a pirate and set both down with a thunk that said protocol. \u201cSoft systems first,\u201d she announced to the room like a drill sergeant who had retired from a kinder army but kept the hat. \u201cBackups for hands. Touch your knees before you trip. Nobody lights anything with a panic. You, eyebrows,\u201d she said to Sammi, \u201cmake your grandfather proud with that stove but keep it away from paper that hasn\u2019t decided its career path.\u201d\n\nThe beekeeper lit the beeswax and the room softened in a way no salon had accomplished, the light honey-gentle and stubborn. People went quieter, not because they\u2019d been told to, but because the room had changed the scale of its voice and asked for a different kind of listening. Outside, lightning blew a white hole in the sky and stitched it closed again. The ovens sat, their pilot lights alive, their brains confused. He knew this feeling in people. He reached for the manual override because his hands preferred levers to buttons when things got real. The first flame caught with a cough. The second refused to be told and then flirted and came. He had never loved an inanimate object the way he loved a well-behaved gas line in a storm.\n\nThey made rolls by feel. He could not see the dough\u2019s exact shine but he had spent so many hours touching it into place that his hands recognized the right wet as surely as he recognized Lena\u2019s laugh in a bar. He balanced pans on racks that seemed to lean toward him with interest. He sent the eyeliner girl out with small plates and a command whenever the door opened and the storm shoved, because a plate in a hand could be a promise you kept for a stranger. Sammi poured coffee that tasted like history. The beekeeper moved among people with a tray of candles she had clearly carried for scenarios like this, setting light on tables with the authority of a woman who had convinced insects to stay put.\n\nAt some point, because fate is a writer without a sense of when to leave a scene alone, Smee appeared on the sill, his coat soaked to a darker brick, his collar bell ringing its complaint. He looked in at the light and at the plates and at the people and at Rory with the slow, shredding contempt only cats and certain kinds of art critics manage, then hopped down and pawed at the door until the eyeliner girl opened it with a sigh of a queen. He stepped inside and shook himself with the drama of a dog and then remembered himself and pretended he had meant to do that with poise. Pickles arrived three minutes later because cats text each other with a radio humans can\u2019t hear. The two animals looked at one another in a way that would have caused a duel if they were men, then found separate high surfaces and pretended to have been raised to better standards. Somewhere at a corner table a woman took their picture and then put her phone away and watched the rain instead, which was a turn in the plot he approved of.\n\nHe gave away what would not keep. He told the room the truth: that sugar dislikes being asked to wait beyond reason, that some foods are only themselves in a very narrow window you can miss by being decent and cautious. People paid anyway, because the city liked to make that kind of math come out. During one roll of thunder that made the windows tray-rattle, he looked up and saw, at the hinge of two candles near the door, his mother and a woman he did not know. The woman was small and wore a cardigan that had lost a button in a place that would have embarrassed a person with a different relationship to embarrassment. They shared a plate and they rested their forearms on the table like sisters who had survived each other and were practicing being tender. He could feel himself gasp without sound. His mother looked at him only once, and in that glance said, Not now, I am busy learning, which was a sentence he had not thought she possessed.\n\nPenelope walked in with a plastic crate that had seen floods and weddings. \u201cOther ovens,\u201d she announced, plunking the crate on the prep table, \u201chot and ready to insult you if you call them cute. You are not allowed to have a hero narrative if I am present. We bake as a species or not at all.\u201d She shook rain out of her hair like a saint with a sense of humor and took pans as if they were babies. He wanted to kiss her forehead and contented himself with making her tea on the camping stove because the line between gratitude and worship had to be preserved for days without lightning.\n\nAn hour in the room had a rhythm, the way blackouts do when people decide they would rather be kind than frantic. The janitor supervised a spontaneous project to prop the door at intervals to let in air and not rain because you can solve physics with teamwork if the hallway smells like cinnamon. The girl with the eyeliner took a woman by the elbow so she would not stomp a child underfoot and then released her before the woman noticed she had been shepherded. Dee stood in the corner where the floor sloped, where accidents liked to be born, and watched for them, her hand on her hip, the other on the battery lantern as if ready to shine down on trouble like a god the size of a auntie. Cassidy appeared at some point with an umbrella that had given up and hair like a plot twist, slid behind the counter unasked, and took a bag of trash out as if she had been born there. \u201cThis is my idea of heaven,\u201d she told him when she passed. \u201cControlled chaos and sugar. Do not be humble when the lights come back. Let people think you planned this. I will slander you on television if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen the streetlamps blinked awake and the room made that small, guilty sound spaces make when electricity forgives them, the candles burned on. No one clapped because there was nothing to applaud; it felt as if the scene had reached a natural end and someone had tugged the curtain because they were cold. He let the ovens go back to their newer habits with a pat on the side a man would be mocked for if seen elsewhere. They finished the last tray and sent the last plate out because stopping mid-bake is an affront to the gods of small consistency. When the door closed on the last customer who had stood for five minutes at the threshold to push his wet hair off his forehead and decide whether to step into light or storm, he turned and leaned his shoulder against the cool of the walk-in and let himself laugh. It sounded like what a person might mistake for crying at a distance, and he did not mind if someone did.\n\nThey cleaned slower, the way you clean when the room has told you stories and needs silence to keep them. The beeswax candles made the floor look forgiving. The cats had both vanished, because mystery requires punctuation and they were professionals. The beekeeper collected the stubs and hummed under her breath in a way that made the hairs on his forearms stand, as if the room recognized the song even if his ear did not. Sammi wiped down a counter like a man who had been given a second childhood with a rag. Dee sat on a milk crate and rolled her ankle and pronounced it fit for another five decades, then stood and kissed the top of his head because she was, on rare occasions, a person who allowed herself to be sentimental for the span of one breath.\n\nWhen the buckets were empty and the racks lined with a single clean towel to feel less alone and the register counted down to a number that would pay the light bill and the indignity bill and leave enough for flour, he and the beekeeper climbed to the roof. The storm had moved on but left its laundry on the line. The city steamed in patches. The river carried a branch the size of a confession and a small army of bottles that would never get to tell their story. They set the little hive box near the back corner where brick met sky. The beekeeper breathed like a woman who had taught lungs to find patience. He felt something in his chest answer that lesson with gratitude. The bees would wake and learn the map and tell one another where the flowers were; the roof would become a sentence in their dance.\n\nHe slept that night as if his body had finally accepted the terms of the job. He woke once to the distinct thrum through the open window that meant life and was not loud about it. He slept again.\n\nIn the morning the river had changed color the way it does after a night of conversation, brown lifted into a green that wasn\u2019t a feeling you could put words to. He went to the bridge and leaned his forearms on the railing and watched the little islands of debris cruise to a rendezvous they had not planned. A man a few feet away flicked a cigarette into the wind and then looked sorry because the water was in a mood that made even litterers patient. Rory thought of ice shards and sugar and the night before and of the way things hold form when they want to and don\u2019t when they need to change. He let the whole of it pass through the narrow part in him where worry likes to sit. It moved on.\n\nBack at the shop, the electrician had left a note wedged in the door in handwriting that made you forgive his rates. He had circled a breaker box on a little map and written Look here first like a love letter in a language you\u2019d learned in high school and were now teaching yourself again. The landlord\u2019s granddaughter stood on the sidewalk with coffee and a smile that said she had fought a small war with her father and both of them had won. \u201cBees,\u201d she said, with no sarcasm and a little dread. \u201cIf they sting him he will have to learn not to take it personally. He is the kind of man who thinks yellow jackets are after his character. I told him if he wanted to ban them he could go out there and tell them himself. He\u2019s not fond of ladders. We\u2019re a go until somebody with a clipboard says we aren\u2019t. Then we\u2019ll hide the box by putting a sign in front of it that says Electrical. No one ever looks behind those.\u201d\n\nHe shook her hand and it felt like the cement after a sidewalk gets fixed, that moment when it holds and still remembers being liquid. He tied a little ribbon of caution tape on the ladder so the clumsy would be warned and thought of Nana, who would have called the bees \u201cthe girls\u201d and baked them something sugary and unnecessary. At eleven, the first customer was the man who runs the ice machine at the dive bar on his block, who said, \u201cHeard you kept it open in the dark,\u201d as if he were giving a medal to a person for standing still in rain. At noon, the girl with the eyeliner stapled a flyer for a mentorship night to the bulletin board and looked away like she didn\u2019t want to see it become real. At one, Penelope dropped a bag of flour labeled in permanent marker with obscene pet names because bakers are sentimental in that weird way. At two, his mother came in with a teenage boy Rory had never seen and said, \u201cThis is who I was before I knew you,\u201d without any drama, just the temperature of a truth laid on a table.\n\nHe learned her name old again, because some days words need exhuming and polish. He made them both lemon something that the boy said was indoor sunlight. The boy had his mother\u2019s jaw and another person\u2019s impatience. He sat awkward and alert as if deciding on an opinion about this room and the man in it that he would be stuck with for the next ten years. The mothers of cities carry these decisions in their purses and their bones. Rory took a breath that felt like a long hallway and said hello to the boy in a tone he would take to churches if he ever went, and the boy said hello back in a tone that he would deploy in cafeterias until he learned not to waste it on people who didn\u2019t deserve his careful.\n\nHe had to cut himself loose from the counter to meet a man with a ladder and an invoice for the hood and he wanted to stay at the table where his mother\u2019s hands were folded and her knuckles looked like they did when she was twenty-five and knocked on the neighbor\u2019s door to complain about the music. He had to trust that some scenes could be re-entered after you signed the line under a number. Dee caught his eye across the room and did the thing she did when he was choosing between being present and being needed. She tipped her chin toward his mother with the imperceptible motion of a woman who had orchestrated a triage in a storm and a bake sale in a snow. He nodded and let his hands do the moving, the head do the nodding, the body do the several contradictory things bodies do when you are in charge of flour and feelings.\n\nThe letter from the station where he used to ride the elevator and recoil at his reflection came two days later. It was from the HR person whose name had probably been memed in a Slack channel for her insistence on phrases like \u201coffboarding\u201d and \u201clegacy task integration.\u201d It said his last paycheck would be short two hours because someone could not read a clock or had chosen not to, and it said there would be cake at a gathering he would not attend, and it said all the right things in the wrong order. He set it on the counter and wrote himself a little invoice for the missing hours in pencil on the back of a flour receipt and then placed it inside Nana\u2019s recipe book because that kept the math from feeling like money and more like weather.\n\nIt would have been enough to take those hours back with stubbornness and a phone call. It would have been fine to let them go like pennies into a jar you never empty. Instead, he sent a plate and a note with a kid who had learned the elevator\u2019s grudges, the note addressed to the plant. It said, \u201cI left you three song titles worth of secrets. Please tell them only to the next person who empties the bucket.\u201d He put the missing hours into a tip pool for his new people because it seemed like a spell your grandmother writes on a scrap and says aloud while you\u2019re peeling potatoes.\n\nThe blackout became a story the city told itself generously for three days. He had to bat it away with careful hands when men with microphones tried to make it into a fable about bootstraps because he had been held up by an entire parade during a storm. He took a call from a man whose voice had the Indiana he had not wanted in it, and he did not know, until he knew, that it was his father. The man said his name twice, as if calling a dog that might remember even after a long winter in which names were not used and only whistles were allowed. \u201cSaw your face,\u201d his father said, and the quality of that seeing was a dozen kinds of wrong and three kinds of right. \u201cI\u2019d like a roll.\u201d He could hear the background, could hear a television that had been left on for company and air buzzing and a refrigerator that had not been cleaned in a decade but kept trying.\n\nRory felt his stomach step out of the room for a second and have a smoke. He watched his right hand lay itself palm-down on the counter without instruction as if to remind the rest of him where he was and what he could steady. He thought he would say no in a crisp-clean way and then he did not, because there were mothers in city light making peace at tables and there were boys leaning on napkins with new thoughts in their elbows. \u201cSunday,\u201d he said, hearing the word land in front of him like a thing to step over. \u201cEleven. There will be people. You can stand with them or not. If not, I will hand you a paper bag and you can leave it unopened on your seat until you change your mind.\u201d He heard the man on the other end shift a breath. He said something that wasn\u2019t sorry and might have been its cousin, then did the decent thing and hung up before either of them tried to improve the moment and smudged it.\n\nThe roof bees settled with the nonchalance of successful colonizers. He learned the hum of them the way you learn the creaks of an old house, which stair to step on wrong with a friend so you both fall down laughing and which to avoid when the person asleep in the next room deserves world peace. The beekeeper texted him pictures of pollen saddlebags that made him want to purchase a microscope and forgive his sixth-grade science teacher. He smudged his first sting like a blessing on his wrist and did not mind the pulse of it for an hour. He put a sign under the crown that said the honey used in this room comes from ladies in your sky and watched people\u2019s faces soften in the way of people who have been allowed to consider their air alive.\n\nHe gave a talk at the library because a woman with a nametag and a fierceness of glasses asked him, and people sat in the lower-level room with the carpet that smelled like old glue and spilled childhood and listened to him tell them the fewer words version of the whole long thing. He saw three men from the late shift sit in the back near the outlet because there was a phone to charge. He saw a woman who had played viola in the Music Hall orchestra even though it had never paid properly and who now taught children to use their arms like wings. He saw the janitor in a clean shirt with his grandchild who wore everything like armor. He was asked, very carefully by a man whose nose had been broken once and set by a person who did not possess art, whether he had forgiven anyone. He answered with butter. It was the only way he knew to make honesty edible in public.\n\nOn a Wednesday when the river wore its green-brown good suit and the city held its humidity like a grudge, he put up a hand-lettered notice on the bulletin board next to the flyers for jazz and dog sitting and rooms above bars. It said Custodians Eat Free on Tuesdays and Do Not Tell Me Otherwise. He had meant it as a joke with blood in it. He had meant it as a small tithe to a god he had served. A week later a woman in a shirt with bleach ghosts came in and tried to pay anyway and he refused twice and took a dollar for the staff tip jar the third time because dignity does in fact enjoy tipping. She sat with her back straight and her face relaxed and ate slowly and took a second to swipe the crumbs into a little pile with her palm so she could carry them in her mouth and not on her shirt back to a hallway with a schedule on a clipboard.\n\nThere were nights in that stretch where he forgot how to speak in sentences not made of nouns, where he handed the tray and lifted the towel and knocked the oven door with his knee to remind it who was in charge. There were hours when the river and the road and the alley and the bees and the cat bells and the cheap seats and the crown and the smell of black walnuts tangled in a way that could only be combed with sleep. On those mornings he stood with his hands in dishwater and let plates become circles again. He smoothed the sticker on the new bin that said Team Night Custard Clean and felt the corner hold. The city made its own weather, in storms and in rooms, and he had decided to stand where he could taste it and let it ruin him and wake him and then feed him toast with honey until he could stand again. He had learned to tie his shoes tighter when the floor was wet. He had learned to light an oven by hand when it argued. He had learned that good news, if you held it, had weight after all. He had learned that the lamp over his sink would turn his hands a color that made him want to keep them. He put them back in the dough, and the day, which was a kind one or pretending to be, lifted its chin and let him.",

                              "content": "By the time the night custodians finished the east wing of the office tower and the first blue smear of morning fingered the river, Rory Grady could feel bleach in the creases of his knuckles like a second pulse. Cincinnati was still mostly asleep, a few trucks humming west on the Brent Spence, river fog bruised by sodium lights. He pushed his cart past rows of empty cubicles and screensaver nebulae, picking up confetti from last night\u2019s sales celebration, a champagne cork that had rolled behind a ficus with desperate, childhood determination. He should have had music in his ear\u2014Dee always told him to use a playlist and zone out\u2014but he preferred the creak and squeak of his wheels and the occasional thump-thump of a tired man trying to buckle the city back together before the bankers returned.\n\nAt the north windows, he paused and watched the Ohio slide like a long thought beneath the Roebling Bridge, those tidy pale ropes running up to the sky. Across the water, Covington had a handful of lights glowing in kitchen windows. He imagined a few early risers whisking eggs and working batter into silky spirals. It made the hunger in his chest ache. Not for food, not precisely. For a mixing bowl the size of a child, for the heavy comfort of a measured cup leveling off with the back of a knife, for the whisper of flour.\n\nHe had learned flour under his Nana\u2019s kitchen lamp, the one with the stained glass shade in amber and claret. Mix until it looks like the inside of a cloud, Nana would say, and then, more sternly, Leave it alone. Don\u2019t fuss it to death. If he stood very still now, he could hear the wooden drawers sliding open to reveal scuffed cups and spoons, could smell butter and something deeper\u2014nutmeg maybe, or the piney cut of black walnut\u2014which was Ohio in a bowl. At twelve, when other boys were making paper airplanes out of math worksheets or learning to cuss properly, he was sifting. It embarrassed him then. Now it saved him.\n\nHe dumped a trash bag into the bin and tied it with a quick twist, his fingers moving in the small, deft way they had when he crimped a pie. Stickers on the bin read Team Queen City Clean and had peeling corners that he smoothed reflexively each morning. He wheeled the cart around a desk where someone had left a memo face-up, and there was the word budget like a red kite yanked by wind, followed by numbers, numbers, numbers that meant nothing to him. This world was glossy. He came in after-hours to scrub away the smudges that daytime left. His world was stainless steel bowls and secondhand ovens and eggs that, when cracked, sometimes surprised him with a double yolk as if the morning had whispered, Try again, Rory. Try one more.\n\n\u201cStop staring at the river and finish the twelfth floor before the sun fries your skin. You Irish boys catch light like paper. You ever notice that?\u201d Dee\u2019s voice was a generous rasp. She had been a nurse once\u2014this surprised people until she told them the story of the hospital that swallowed twelve years of her life and spit her out when her back pulled and she forgot a code. Coffee sloshed in her travel mug with a little hiss each time she rolled her own cart. \u201cI mean it, Grady. You\u2019ve got batter in your brain.\u201d\n\nHe grinned and kept mopping. \u201cBatter is where the answers live.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe answer is: quit wiping with that limp wrist. Put muscle in it so I don\u2019t have to redo your streaks. I already redid your streaks last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was insulted.\u201d\n\nThey moved like that through the morning\u2014through carpet and tile, cubicles and glass. Across the hall from the Board Room, Rory flicked the mop one last time and glanced at his phone not because he expected anything but because a habit is a superstition in overalls. His home screen was a photo he\u2019d seen tucked in a cookery book once: a black-and-white of hands dusted with flour, the knuckles and heel of the palms smudged into a storm. No new calls. A promotional email from a chain bakery offering him a doughnut in exchange for a pound of his personal data. An alert about the weather: bright, wind later. Then, a subject line that made his mouth go desert-dry.\n\nCrown & Crust Finalist\u2014Availability Confirmation.\n\nHe touched it and the screen refused to respond; his thumb was damp and the phone seemed to step back, shy. He wiped his hands on his pants, even though they were as clean as they were going to get, and tried again. The email bloomed open like a flower.\n\nWe are pleased to inform you, it began. Due to unforeseen circumstances, a finalist slot has opened up for Crown & Crust. After reviewing your audition portfolio and preliminary performances, we would like to invite you to compete in the live final at Cincinnati Music Hall. Please confirm your availability by\u2014\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pass out. The floor is clean here and hate to dirty it with you.\u201d Dee had come up behind him and could read upside down like a bat. \u201cLet me guess. You won a Caribbean cruise. Or we both did. It\u2019s a timeshare, honey. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d Rory said, and heard his own voice as if it were someone else\u2019s\u2014light and floating, not clipped and tired like usual.\n\nDee took the phone with hands that were slow and capable and smelled faintly of lemon oil. She read the email twice. \u201cOh, come on now. After all the times you told me those producers forgot you existed. You told me that with drama, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did forget me. They forgot me six times.\u201d He could feel his smile trying to climb his face, and he let it. \u201cThis is\u2014this is crazy, Dee. This is a glitch. They pulled my name by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing your what-now? After reviewing your you-beatten eggs, they said. The colored lights want you. That\u2019s what it says. Confirm your availably by noon, weirdo. Noon,\u201d she repeated, as though he might mistake it for autumn. \u201cCall them. Before the world bends back and snaps shut.\u201d\n\nHe called, fumbling with speaker and then not, hearing his own breath on the line and the little desktop waterfall in the manager\u2019s office behind them trickling like scripted serenity. A woman answered in the crisp voice of someone whose job it was to keep moving before the enthusiasm of amateur bakers could catch her and drag her into a chat about meringue.\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Grady. We had a finalist fall ill, and your name is at the top of our list. Your preliminary round pies were remarkable. The texture on that rye croissant you brought the camera crew\u2014I still think about the structure. And the thing with the black walnut and honey. You\u2019re local, and we love when locals take the stage at Music Hall. It makes the crowd happier.\u201d Always the crowd, thought Rory. Always the swell of them, arranged like a mouth.\n\n\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d he said, because the boy inside him, the one with the Nana lamp throwing patchy light on his homework, did not believe good news had weight. Good news lived in clouds. It would blow away the second he reached for it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sure. Can you be at the technical walkthrough Wednesday afternoon? Production needs to measure your bench height, make sure you can reach the ovens comfortably, things like that. Ms. Vale would like to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u201cCassidy Vale? I mean\u2014yes. Yes, I can. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\n\nHe hung up and Dee set her palm between his shoulders and leaned in with the measured pressure she kept for people who were coughing or confessing. \u201cWell, if that isn\u2019t a kick in the heart. Look at you. Look at your eyes going bright. I wish I\u2019d brought a camera. You\u2019re gonna make the city proud, even if you trip and drop a whole anythings on live television. You\u2019ll be charming. You are. You\u2019re a mess, but you\u2019re charming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to faint in front of Cassidy Vale, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d He felt giddy the way he had once, on a rollercoaster when he was seventeen, riding with Lena and screaming until the scream broke into laughter and the laughter into tears. He could see it laid out like a pastry case: a crowd, lights, ovens humming like lions in cages, the host\u2019s smile white and the sort of white that you think of later when your kitchen window goes cloudy at dawn. He could almost hear the whisk against metal that said, move, move, a show is not a kitchen; a show is speed; a show is a story you tell with butter.\n\nHe texted Lena in Covington. His thumbs slicked and stumbled. guess who just got a slot on crown + crust? he typed, and then added too many exclamation points and deleted two, left one, added two more. A black storm of dots appeared as she typed back.\n\nAs in the tv show? As in the thing you made us all sit perfectly still for six Sunday nights in a row last summer? As in you are going to faint on live television and make me change my last name? Proud of you, stupid.\n\nHe grinned so hard his cheeks hurt. \u201cI have to practice,\u201d he said to Dee. \u201cI have two days and my oven runs hot and the weather\u2019s weird and my hands are shaky and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to finish the eleventh floor so we can clock out and get you home. Then you can burn that tiny apartment down with caramel. Practice is nothing if your landlord throws you into the street.\u201d\n\nWhen they finished the last office, pulled the carts back into the supply closet, and filled the bucket with clean water to soak the mops, Rory took an extra half-second to run a cloth along the shelf\u2019s edge. It felt like placating some complicated god. You do what you do. You make a surface gleam. You make space.\n\nHe walked home in the brightening. Sixth Street had a few cars and the sweet smell of something sugary rising from a bakery two blocks over. It wasn\u2019t much of a bakery; the sort that warmed frozen croissants and told commuters they were fresh out of the oven. Still, the scent wrapped itself around him and teased. He cut over toward Over-the-Rhine and let himself in at his building, past the ferns Mrs. Kline had arranged in plastic urns on the bannister, past the paper flier advertising a lost parakeet\u2014small, green, answers to the name of Bean, if found please do not yell\u2014and up the worn stairs to his floor.\n\nMrs. Kline poked her head out as if his footsteps had rung a bell. She had the look of someone who\u2019d thrown her hair into a bun in 1973 and never taken it down again. \u201cMorning, Rory,\u201d she said. \u201cYou smell like lemon and something else. Glue?\u201d\n\n\u201cVictory,\u201d he said, and leaned on the railing. \u201cMaybe victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve won the lottery, I\u2019m switching out your locks and raising the rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019ve won the lottery, I\u2019ll buy you a door that doesn\u2019t stick every time the humidity changes.\u201d He liked her because she could be mean at a moment\u2019s notice, and that sort of meanness was almost always worry. \u201cI\u2019m in a baking competition. The final. Music Hall.\u201d\n\nHer lips parted. \u201cOh! Well. Aren\u2019t you a\u2014aren\u2019t you something.\u201d She swatted at the air like compliments were wasps. \u201cYou\u2019re always bringing me those scone things. What are they called. Scones. You brought me scones. You want me to watch?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you watch, the stage will catch fire. That\u2019s a proven thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make jokes or else the evil eye\u2019ll take you. Pickles, no! Get down!\u201d The cat had slipped past her ankles to eye Rory\u2019s shoelaces like prey. Pickles was fat and orange and wore a bell that turned him into a fleet of sleighs when he ran. He had a contrarian soul, also a grudge against mops.\n\n\u201cPickles,\u201d Rory said in his diplomatic voice. \u201cWe are friendly. We don\u2019t scratch. We coexist.\u201d\n\nPickles flicked his tail as if that settled it. He swiped at Rory\u2019s lace and then rubbed his head against Rory\u2019s calf with a sudden violence that was almost tender. Something like the hush before a storm. Pickles\u2019 pupils were wide, a pair of black olives in a soup.\n\n\u201cHe woke me at three by trying to suffocate me,\u201d Mrs. Kline said. \u201cHe\u2019s been restless. It\u2019s the weather. It\u2019s the neighborhood. It\u2019s television damaging our pets. It\u2019s\u2014go to bed, Rory. I\u2019m arguing because it\u2019s Tuesday.\u201d\n\nHe unlocked his door and stood for a second in the little square of his kitchen. The place had been a studio once, before a landlord with practical dreams carved it into two smaller rectangles. His couch had a sag where he slept sometimes; the bed was narrow and patient; the sink had a particular way of complaining when he ran hot water too long. He set his phone on the table, poured a glass of tap water, and plucked the magnet from the fridge that held Nana\u2019s recipe for pecan flips. He had a sheet of black walnuts in a paper bag in the cupboard, cracked last month by a woman at Findlay Market in exchange for three little jam tarts. He pulled the bag out and inhaled the scent: sharp, thick, almost medicinal in the way of loves that have saved your life more than once.\n\nOn the shelf above the stove, a framed photo of him and Nana leaned against the wall. It had been taken at her kitchen table, which was too close to the oven, a hazard he didn\u2019t understand until he was older and fussed over heat distribution. They were both holding their hands up as if they were swearing to tell the truth. Their palms were white as if they\u2019d been trying to disappear. Nana always told him to do the thing that was in his hands, the thing that sat in the palm like a bird. Don\u2019t get fancy, Augie, she\u2019d say sometimes, calling him that old family nickname he pretended to hate. Flour and butter, sugar and eggs. The basics. And when the heaven television calls, you answer. You don\u2019t put them on hold. That part she\u2019d added more recently in his imagination, because she died when he was nineteen and there was no television then that cared about the way his wrist flicked when he whisked.\n\nHe napped for two hours in his narrow bed with the shade half down, the line of light across his feet moving softly as if not to wake him. The dream he had was a bakery dream: egg whites that refused to peak no matter how he whispered to them, bowls that slipped sideways and ran away, an oven door that led to a street and then to the river, which steamed like soup. He woke with a dry mouth and an idea pinwheeling. Honey walnut cake with a rye crumb. Lemon curd on one tier but not in the usual way. Something like that. Something Ohio and a little bit immigrant and a little bit old lady and a little bit television.\n\nHe set bowls on the counter, lined them up like reliquaries, cracked eggs, separated yolks, watched the whites slide away clean. He always let himself be proud of that little neat act. The first tablespoon of sugar rained into the yolks like news. He stirred and the angle of his elbow was his father\u2019s, the only thing he had gotten good from the man. He ran the mixer and the sound softened something else inside him, a knot that always wrapped around the morning. He cut butter into flour and the fat mapped itself into flakes the size of small coins. He threw a slack dish towel over the bowl and let it sit, let it breathe and think.\n\nAt noon he went down to the corner and bought himself good honey from a woman who kept bees and wore outrageously wide-brimmed hats. \u201cYou\u2019re a baker,\u201d she said, thrusting a jar at him like a weapon. \u201cI remember faces that come back because they tasted something true. If you put this in a cake, I will come to your house to get a piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on television,\u201d he said impulsively, only because he had not yet said it to a stranger and wanted to see how those words looked out in the open air. \u201cThe final. Music Hall.\u201d\n\nShe took his hand in both of hers. \u201cBless. Better not mess it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI intend to be slightly underwhelming and then maybe we\u2019ll all be pleasantly surprised,\u201d he said, and she laughed, and the laugh went up into the hat like gold.\n\nOn the way home, he paused outside the caf\u00e9 where Sammi worked and looked at the chalkboard that announced their new almond milk like it was a revolution. Sammi spotted him and waved him in. He tapped the glass for once, breaking his own rule about only tapping glass in aquariums.\n\n\u201cYou look like you swallowed a light bulb,\u201d Sammi called, pulling espresso with an elegant efficiency that made him jealous even though espresso was a facile trick and pastry was slow love. \u201cWhat happened? Did Dee finally propose? I told her she would. Honestly, she\u2019s been playing the long game.\u201d\n\nHe told him. Sammi screamed in a way that made the customers turn and smile and one man frown as if he had been cheated. Sammi came around the counter to squeeze his shoulders. \u201cAbout time. Sometimes the world almost resembles justice. Do you need espresso? Or would that make you too crazed and then you\u2019d go home and explode butter from the cabinets.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne shot. Make it kind. I have to practice piping.\u201d\n\nSammi set the cup in front of him and then folded his arms and leaned on the counter like an aunt. \u201cAnd after you win? Will you leave me for a nicer coffee shop with marble counters and people who wear crisp aprons for fun?\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter I win,\u201d Rory said, testing the shape of the words in his mouth like a new pastry tip, \u201cI\u2019ll come here and buy a round for the house and then I\u2019ll go home and I\u2019ll bake the biggest cake you\u2019ve ever seen and I\u2019ll eat it on my floor with a fork.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t eat a victory cake alone. I\u2019ll come with plates. Bring paper. You know you hate dishes when you\u2019re emotional.\u201d\n\nHe went home with the espresso warmth lingering, like a friend who didn\u2019t leave even when you pushed back your chair. He rolled dough smooth, folded it like a letter, rolled it again. He piped tiny peaks on shortbreads and then swiped them off because the peaks were smug. He baked a failed chiffon just for the pleasure of tasting the failure and biting into the particular resilience of egg and sugar when they decide to resist your charms. He kept his phone face-down on the table so he wouldn\u2019t see the minutes. Whenever it buzzed, he jumped, convinced it would be an email recanting the invitation or a text from Lena that read JK.\n\nThe walk-through took place in a world that had been assembled and polished and snapped into place since the last time he\u2019d seen it. Music Hall in the afternoon was dark and wide like a hand. Crew in black tee shirts rolled carts. A camera on a crane swung overhead as slowly and ominously as a planet. He stood on the stage with a name placard\u2014GRADY, R.\u2014a bank of ovens behind his station like patient warm fellows, like heavy animals at rest. The bench was actually a touch too low and he said so and someone came with shims and slid them under the legs as if they were slipping money into a birthday card.\n\n\u201cRory Grady,\u201d said a voice behind him, and he turned to see Cassidy Vale with her human brightness turned down to a simmer. In person she was smaller, her teeth no less white, her laugh contained for now because there was no audience to take it and multiply it by ten. She shook his hand. \u201cSo you\u2019re the hometown story. Thank God. If I had to pretend to love another pretty Californian this week, I\u2019d have quit and gone to sell muffins from a truck.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cI love Californians.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t. And if you do, pretend otherwise. I read your file. Custodian. We love that. Television loves that. Are you ready to be edited into a composite of hardworking, humble grit with a dash of Nana?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Nana would love to be edited into anything. She would haunt you if you didn\u2019t mention her.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Cassidy said, and her eyes had the glint of a person who could catch two balls while you threw a third. \u201cWe\u2019re on live delay but not long enough to save you if you swear. Don\u2019t swear. Don\u2019t set the station on fire. If you cry, do it in a way that makes our camera stay on your eyes. If you need anything, yell my name on the side with the golden recorder, not the side with the hot mic.\u201d\n\nShe moved on and he touched the counter, then touched it again. The people around him were a comfortable blur: stage managers, lighting technicians carrying their ladders like friendly giraffes, and three other bakers in street clothes who eyed him with open curiosity and a little territorial defensiveness.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d said one of them, a woman with hair that looked like she had rolled out of a nap on a lawn and freckles that had fallen on her nose like ash. \u201cYou the local kid they hauled out of some broom closet? I\u2019m Penelope Hart. I do the bread cart at the German restaurant. My sourdough starter is older than my resentment.\u201d\n\n\u201cRory,\u201d he said. \u201cCustodial engineer.\u201d\n\nShe snorted. \u201cNice to meet you, future rival-slash-ally. That\u2019s Jace with the hat and Abby with the earlobe thing. Abby\u2019s pastry cream makes you forget your mother\u2019s name for two hours, minimum. Congratulations on sneaking in at the end.\u201d\n\nHe liked the way she said it. As if he had run in right before a closing door and no one could be mad because the door had left that last inch as a dare. He shook hands with the others. When they all moved to check their stations, he stood alone for a moment and looked out into the yawning dark where the crowd would be. He thought of Mrs. Kline in her apartment with the cat on her lap, rolling his eyes at the way she yelled at the television. He thought of Lena on her couch, knees up, a beer sweating into her palm. He thought of Dee standing in a clean hallway at four a.m. next week and telling a plant, because no one else was there to hear, that she knew him first.\n\nThe stage door swung open then and light poured in, and something low to the floor streaked in like a rumor. A stagehand laughed and snapped his fingers. \u201cHow do you keep getting in here, man? Out. Back out.\u201d The thing paused in the middle of the stage and Rory made out a cat the color of brick, its tail like a question mark. It stared at him with that stare cats have that says they have already judged you and found you deficient.\n\n\u201cStage cat,\u201d Penelope said from behind him. \u201cName\u2019s Smee. He hates equipment cases and also most men. If you give him salmon, he\u2019ll remember you in his will and leave you at least a chunk of the lighting grid.\u201d\n\nSmee trotted toward the wings, then stopped, as if reconsidering, and flopped onto his side under the table with the mixing bowls. One of the crew hissed, a hissing meant to be friendly. Smee answered with a hiss that was not at all friendly. Rory crouched halfway, thought better of it, stood again. He had no quarrel with opinionated animals. He would feed Smee later\u2014no, he would not. He would ignore Smee and Smee might ignore him, in the ancient contract.\n\nHe took the tram home. He stood by the window and watched the city slide by. The air had turned into that hot-cool Midwest spring weirdness where you take off your jacket and then put it back on and then take it off again as if being inside fabric and outside it could cure attention. He thought about what he could make that would be his and the city\u2019s, not in a false way, not in a Cincinnati chili cake that everyone would talk about because of the peppers and then never want to eat again. He wanted the judges to take a bite, close their eyes, and be in a kitchen they had never visited, with a lamp whose shade made everything into amber and claret.\n\nAt home, he dragged out his old, heavy stand mixer, the one his sister had found at a church sale and which made a brittle sound when you flipped the switch, as if it were startled to be asked to work again. He roasted the walnuts slowly until the kitchen smelled like smoke and promise. He beat butter until it went from yellow to cream to something he could almost spread on a wound. He sifted flour and wanted to cry for no reason he could tell, only this: that he got to do this, that his hands know how to move in this shape without being told.\n\nPickles thumped against his door in a way that suggested he had thrown himself at it for fun. He yowled once. He yowled like a trumpet. \u201cNot now,\u201d Rory called, ridiculous for answering a cat as if it were a neighbor. \u201cI\u2019m baking.\u201d\n\nHe used honey sparingly. He wanted its light, not its shout. He folded the nut into the batter and thought of the trees that made them, stubborn and handsome, standing in the yards of old houses where they had outlived three owners. He poured the batter into pans and slid them into the oven, then watched the oven window as if looking hard could make a cake rise truer.\n\nWhen the timer went, he did not fling open the door. He opened it like the face of someone he loved. The cakes domed slightly. Steam escaped with a sound that might have been his shoulders dropping. He tapped the top with his finger, felt the give and rebound. He let them cool and made the curd with a steady wrist. When he whisked in the butter at the last moment, the entire form transformed into something glossy, something that wanted to wrap itself around a spoon and never leave.\n\nHe set a small slice on a plate, put his fork in it to see how it would resist or surrender. It yielded with a sigh. He took a bite and waited for judgment that did not come. What arrived was a small clear feeling. This will work. This is not the best thing you will ever make, but it will work and you can fix the edges on the second go.\n\nHis phone buzzed. Lena. Mom wants to know if she should tell people. She said she\u2019ll tell the whole bar if you give her a reason.\n\nTell her to tell one person and to whisper it and watch how long it takes to reach the barbacks, he wrote.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t seen their mother in a while. You could want someone and not want the tangle of their stories. He had friends, he had Dee, he had a sister who sent him emails with subject lines like I Found This Loaf On Sale And I Thought Of You, Is That Sad, And Don\u2019t Answer That. He had Mrs. Kline and her mean jokes. He had a cat outside his door that rattled his lock sometimes with supreme confidence. He had a city that let him walk without asking too many questions. He had two days until he had to stand in front of ten thousand hands and bake.\n\nHe washed his bowls. He took out his piping tips and lined them up one by one to see which one he could coerce to be neat. He fell asleep on the couch for forty minutes and then woke with the curl of his spine aching and the urge to make another layer. He did, and it perforated his confidence when it sank in the middle like a boat with a secret. He cut the top with a long knife and told himself to stop for the night.\n\nOutside, the evening had decided to be noisy. The block had a good amount of street music, a trumpet and then a bucket drummer whose rhythms were less music than an argument with polyrhythms, and then a man selling ice cream from a cart that sang in tinny bells. He put his ear to the kitchen window screen and listened to the city. He thought of the baking competition again\u2014not the jolt of it anymore, but the steady weight, the way a stone sits in your pocket and makes you stand a little differently.\n\nIn bed, he rolled over and saw the silhouette of the framed photo. He reached up and found the switch on the lamp. The little square of light made his eyes prickle. He laughed as quietly as he could at himself, at the way joy made him slightly nauseous, like a boat. The last thing he thought before sleep dragged him down was that he needed to buy more parchment paper, and also a new apron that didn\u2019t have the ghost of so many onions in it, and also\u2014because he couldn\u2019t help it\u2014that he would keep his shoes tied tighter onstage because Pickles had reminded him of the treachery of laces.\n\nThe night before the final he decided to bake sweet rolls and take them to the crew because gratitude, because bribery, because sugar helps men lift things with a little more grace. He made the dough as he listened to a podcast in which a woman talked about grief like it was a neighborhood you could walk if you had a good map. He coaxed the dough to rise, then rolled it out and spread butter and cinnamon and brown sugar into the pale blanket, then rolled the whole thing up like a log and cut it into fat rounds. He arranged them in the pan with the tender care of a person setting stones where a river runs rough.\n\nAt two in the morning, someone in the hall laughed like a bark. Pickles shrieked and sprinted, bells furious. Rory looked through the peephole and saw nothing but a coat hung badly on a nail. He turned back to the kitchen. His oven\u2019s light had taken on the glow he associated with late-night conversations, the kind that ended with someone saying, Okay, okay, let\u2019s do the thing then.\n\nHe thought of the angry cat acting as hall monitor and shook his head. The cat had a job, too, he supposed. To be difficult and gorgeous and to make sure no one became too confident. He iced the rolls and put them aside.\n\nOn the morning of the final, he woke before the alarm, before the light, and stood there with his palms flat on the refrigerator door as if it were a question. He brought the sweet rolls and his recipe book and the apron that had a smooth new weight. He stared at himself in the mirror until his face looked like a stranger\u2019s, then like his own, then like Nana\u2019s, then like a stranger\u2019s again. Faces do that when they have to be borrowed by an audience for a while.\n\nHe met Dee outside the hall. She had changed out of her cleaning shirt into something she considered dressy, which was cleaner jeans and earrings that flashed when she moved her head. She took his hand, squeezed. \u201cGo in there and break their little hearts with a crumble. I\u2019ll be in the cheap seats with the loud people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least mispronounce my last name if you shout. That\u2019s tradition.\u201d He wanted to hug her but thought if he did his ribcage would crack like spun sugar.\n\nHe went through the stage door. The corridor smelled like coffee and dust and something metallic he couldn\u2019t place at first. The crew took his pan of rolls with grateful whoops. Someone handed him a mic pack. Abby tried out a joke on him and it didn\u2019t land, so they both agreed it was terrible and shook out nervous energy by standing on their toes.\n\nCassidy Vale walked by in her stage dress and sent him a thumbs-up that made something in his stomach roll all the way to the left and back. The judges sat at their long table and read the notes someone had prepared for them with deadly attention, like people who would not tolerate being surprised unless they could clap first.\n\nSmee appeared again, tail high, stalking past the racks of sheet pans. A production assistant made a face at him and Smee bared his teeth in return and then\u2014abrupt, as if making decisions was how he made a living\u2014leapt into the empty mixing bowl on the table next to Rory and curled into a judgmental loaf. A woman with a headset approached and tried to scoop him. Smee went boneless in the way of cats who know the rules and refuse to acknowledge them. The woman swore under her breath and then remembered she was wearing a mic and switched the swear into something else. \u201cSmee, I will personally buy you a pound of fish if you vacate this prep area in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nRory almost laughed and then didn\u2019t. The cat opened one eye. He could have sworn the iris narrowed more at him than at anyone else, as if it had picked a direction for its disdain and planned to carry it through for the rest of its nine and a half lives. He reached out a hand and then withdrew it. No, best not. Let the universe deal with its own mascots. He checked his mise en place again, familiarizing himself with the angles of the knives, the way the drawers resisted closing, the stubborn edge of the counter. Here he would stand; here he would whisk; here he would fail or fly slightly.\n\nWhen the crowd filtered in, a slow tide, the din shifted from backstage clinks to human sound. He heard, somewhere in the cheap seats, someone yelling his name in a voice that had seen cigarette smoke and roads. He didn\u2019t dare look. He closed his eyes for one heartbeat, maybe two. Nana\u2019s voice in his head, or else his own: Flour. Butter. Sugar. Eggs. Don\u2019t fuss it to death. Let it be what it wants to be.\n\nHe opened his eyes. The lights flooded the stage in a clean brightness that bleached him of his bad thoughts. Cassidy Vale turned to the camera and smiled, and in that instant every irregular corner of his life felt like it had been smoothed into a story. He set his hands on the bench, and beside him the cat\u2019s bell gave a small, disdainful jingle. He could almost swear Smee blinked slow and smug, as if he\u2019d seen things like this before and knew how they turned.\n\nHe breathed. He listened for the cue. And when it came, when the show leaped to life and the timers began ticking like a thousand tiny hearts, his hands moved with their own thin luck. He was still thinking of butter, of Nana\u2019s lamp, of the river, and of the city that had let him scrub it every night and had finally, finally turned toward him the bright face of its stage.",

                              "content": "The first challenge was called Roots and Rivers, which sounded like a craft beer but meant a thing he could hold on to. Cassidy did the announcing with a grin that had teeth in it, her voice looping through the hall and back to the stage as if it had swung on the chandeliers. Tell us the story of your place, she said, tell us what you have dragged here in your apron pockets, tell us what your hands have learned. Make something the judge will want to eat and will also want to marry. Sixty minutes. Go. The clatter and hiss rose, metal finding metal, bodies finding patterns they had drilled into themselves in kitchens that no one had filmed, and Rory\u2019s hands, mercifully, remembered before his brain could interfere. He measured with the thrift he had always admired in Nana, no heaping, no starve, his fingers leveled off sugar with the back of a knife the way she had taught him, as if he were smoothing a bed for someone who would sleep badly if the sheet was rumpled.\n\nHe started his rye crust first, because crust forgave if you treated it with a delicate neglect. The flour was a brownish color that made him want to trust it. The butter had been softened by the lights\u2014he could feel the heat of them on his cheekbones when he looked up too long\u2014and he cut it in with a tool that had not been designed for this exact motion but did not complain. He worked quickly but not fast, that fine distinction you either learned or did not; fast was panic wearing shoes, quick was tenderness with a deadline. The dough came together with a sigh and he patted it into a disc and slid it into the cooler drawer at his station, the one that clicked like a tongue every time you opened it too abruptly. Honey warmed at the back of the stove, the scent already making his thoughts go widen and deepen, like river pools. He cracked eggs and separated them by muscle memory, the whites clean as a whistle, the yolks plump as promises. The walnuts he had roasted low that morning he chopped with a measured brutality, just enough to release the oil and give the mouth something to think about. The curd he began last because he disliked a smug curd; he wanted it to arrive the way a good guest did, late enough to be interesting.\n\nSmee decided the action might also belong to him. He drifted out from under the metal shelving with a lope that suggested he had somewhere to be and that it was unfortunately here. Jace swore softly when Smee brushed his ankle and Penelope spoke to the cat the way you speak to weather, with a respect you hope will be mistaken for persuasion. Rory did not tempt fate by offering a hand. He kept stirring. Sugar, lemon, fire, attention. He watched the edge of the curd go from loose to persuasive and whisked in butter at the moment his chest told him, at that exact shade of yellow that suggested sanctity. Behind him, Cassidy\u2019s voice rose and fell and rose again, translating the chaos into a narrative people at home could fold into their living rooms and their Sunday quiet.\n\nWhen he rolled out the rye crust and set it into the pan, his fingers moved in a tidy ballet. He trimmed with a paring knife that had seen better days and pinched a rough scallop that would never make the cover of a magazine and did not need to. He poured in the nut mixture and let the honey thread through it like a small golden river, then poured in a custard that smelled like lemon rind and salt. He had thought briefly of making two tarts, one as an offering to luck and one to taste and adjust, and then he had remembered that he was on live television, and that this was not the bake sale at St. Gertrude\u2019s. He slid the tart into the oven with a care that made his spine ache with concentration. He did not slam the door. He turned the dial as if it were a volume knob and he was easing the music down instead of summoning the heat up.\n\nHe washed his bowl and wiped his counter because of who he was and where he had been for ten years every night, then started on a small garnish of candied walnut shards that he did not believe in but which television demanded like a tax. The sugar seized on the first try because he looked up at the screen that had his own face on it and flinched at being doubled. He laughed at himself\u2014it came out like a cough\u2014and began again, this time staring at the pot as if his eyes could persuade molecules to behave. The sugar melted, went clear, turned straw, and he tipped in the nuts and stirred with the speed of someone who had learned to move babies from one shoulder to the other without waking them. On the other side of him Abby had a problem with her pastry cream and shouted for a strainer, and he handed her his without looking, an exchange that felt like something you did in a war you weren\u2019t sure you\u2019d chosen.\n\nThe oven door opened with a small catch that felt personal. The tart wobbled when he gave the pan a gentle nudge, the good sort of wobble that promised to set as it cooled, not the tragic sort that said you have failed in a way you will carry home in your coat pocket and feel with your fingers on the train. He set it on the rack, stepped back, and pretended for a second that he was alone in a kitchen with a radio muttering small news about clouds. When it was just cool enough to risk, he loosened the tart and felt it let go with a sound that was mostly imagination, a tiny sigh. He slid the curd into a piping bag and drew a spiral from the center out, as if he were measuring time on its surface. He flicked on the torch and kissed the top in spots, a rumor of heat, a little bruise of color, not enough to make it costume.\n\nThe judges came like a tide that had checked a schedule. They were three, a triptych he had studied in internet clips until he had met each of their eyebrows like neighbors. There was the pastry chef who had a voice that could cut bread, the critic with the pen like a tiny spear, and the baker with the big hands who made everything sound like a coaching speech somebody\u2019s father had given on a field at dusk. They asked him questions while they tasted and he answered without tasting the words first. He told them black walnut was Ohio to him, not in that postcard way, but in the way that bitterness could shade sweetness and make both feel true. He told them about rye and honey and how he liked when things from fields met things from cupboards. The critic closed her eyes when she chewed and Rory pretended not to watch her mouth. The big-handed baker said something kind about restraint. The pastry chef tapped the curd with her spoon and said, in the tone of someone pronouncing on a modest political scandal, that the set was on the softer side. He nodded and said he\u2019d been shy of heat; the lights seemed to be doing some of the work, stupid as that sounded. They moved on and he watched their backs recede and let his lungs remember how to bring air in without making a show of it.\n\nBetween rounds, everything that had felt like a private action was revealed for what it was: a small part of an operation that had been built like a temporary city. A makeup woman swept at his forehead with a brush the size of a baby\u2019s fist and told him not to rub his face because the camera would interpret his gesture as guilt. Cassidy appeared as if she had been shot out of a tube and asked him if he was okay, if he was loving it, if his hands were done being shy. He wanted to tell her that his heart had set to a metronome that was not his, but he said he was good, he said the tart had behaved, he said words like hometown and humbled while trying to arrange his mouth into a shape that was not a flinch. Behind Cassidy he saw, or thought he saw, Lena\u2019s ponytail like a flag six rows up. He caught a flash of a familiar jaw, a notch in a lip, a laugh that came out of a woman with a cigarette voice. His stomach did something catastrophic and then righted itself. He put his hands back on the bench to keep them from trying to swim.\n\nThe technical reached out of the past and took him by the back of his shirt. They handed them recipe cards that could have been telegrams from an anxious aunt. Make schnecken, the card said, and below that a list of ingredients that had the vagueness of poetry. Make dough. Prove. Make caramel. Assemble. Bake until done. Penelope made a noise that sounded like relief in a language he didn\u2019t know, and Jace muttered about his grandmother from Zanesville who had a pan for this and no patience for people who called things by their wrong names. Rory had read about schnecken, had seen the word turn into sticky when someone moved it through their mouth. He thought of the German restaurant Penelope inhabited, of the way Over-the-Rhine held its history and dumped it too, a place that could be fancy and could be a story about a bricked-up door.\n\nHe made a dough like he was making an ally. He coaxed it into being with warm milk and sugar and the quantity of butter that made the judge with the pen sniff and smile and not write anything. He leaned on it with the heel of his hand and then with his fingertips, reading it for signs the way other people read clouds for ships. He tucked it under a damp cloth and willed the air to be an incubator. He made caramel with a toughness around his mouth; he had never liked being watched when sugar was crossing its dangerous street. He swirled the pan instead of stirring. He added a splash of cream when it seemed to protest and the pan coughed like an actor. He rolled the dough when he could not bear it any longer, and it rolled out as obedient as a child who had already gotten in trouble once. He spread the butter and sugar with a palette knife no one called a palette knife on this show, then rolled and cut and set each scroll into the caramel like a ship into harbor.\n\nSmee came back when they were sliding pans into ovens, because of course he did, because wherever there was urgency cats discovered an appetite. He wove between ankles and feinted at a fallen raisin as if it were a mouse. A production assistant looked at Rory like, control your pet, and Rory looked back like, the only animal I control is my own breath. When the timer went and he pulled the pan out, the top had a gloss he could have used as a mirror. He turned them out and one of the buns slid entirely off the pan, onto the floor, and sat there like a fat fallen soldier. He froze for a beat. Then the old mover part of him woke up. He bent, scooped with a new spatula, tossed it into the trash with a dignity that made it look intentional, and reshuffled the rest in the pan so the gap did not show like a missing tooth. Abby winked at him as if to say, I saw, but I saw everything, so don\u2019t worry.\n\nThe judges tasted blind and their eyebrows did coded dances that the internet would slow down into GIFs later. Penelope was first, because of course she was; she carried yeast in her genes and a short fuse that blew in the right direction. Abby took third. Jace, who had overproofed because the lights had convinced him time had softened, sighed so loudly they should have miked it. Rory stood in second and felt relief turn into something like disappointment and then remembered he was in a room with people who made bread with their teeth and gave himself a mental slap for greed.\n\nFor the last round, they brought out a small forest of clear cake boxes and stands that glinted like the inside of a shell. This is your showstopper, Cassidy said, and the audience made a sound that was hunger and catcall and sympathy. Tell us a celebration, Rory heard, tell us the thing you are trying to build when the world tells you to calm down. He had drawn his plan in pencil on a napkin two nights ago when a bus had refused to arrive, a sketch that looked like a bridge and a crown had had a clever child. He saw now how ridiculous the sugar crown was going to be under this humidity and light, and he changed it while washing his hands with the vigor of a surgeon. He would make brown-butter ermine frosting because butter had spoken to him when he was half-awake, and because it wanted to be whipped into a thing that hugged layers without arguing.\n\nHe baked four layers of honey walnut cake with rye flour just enough to give the crumb a conversational weight. He trimmed, he leveled, he brushed each cut surface with a thin wash of honey he had warmed to make it less stubborn. The lemon curd had set like a promise this time; he stirred it smooth and spread it like a thin sun between the lower layers, resisting the urge to pile it on the way a person resists the urge to make a joke at a funeral. He stacked with dowels like a cautious carpenter. He had trained his hands to control weight and balance with mops and bins; now he used the same selection of muscles to persuade cake to behave. He glanced once at the screen when it showed him, and his face looked less like someone in a police lineup and more like someone trying to remember something they loved, which was as much as he could ask from any mirror.\n\nHe made sugar, because he had not been able to let go of the light in his drawing. He cooked it to hard crack, the thermometer a slender prophet that did not always tell truth, and he poured it out into puddles he tried to pull into ropes. The air grinned and refused to help. The ropes broke into shards that had a beauty he could sell to a poet and a fragility he could not use to crown anything. He stared at them, at the way they threw light on the counter and made his hands look injured. He lifted a piece and it broke in his palm and it felt like brittle ice on a river at late winter, and that was when he understood what he should do. He would not fight the air; he would ask it to kneel. He arranged the shards on the top tier like plates of river ice leaning out of one another, as if spring had come and pushed them to the edges. He sprinkled a dust of ground walnut around them that looked like the particular gravel of a riverbank. He tied a barely-there ribbon of candied lemon peel where the top tier met the one below, not to decorate but to hide a seam that wanted to gossip. He stood back and thought of Nana\u2019s lamp and its small jewels of colored glass, and he felt, for a breath, forgiven for every time he had doubted his hands.\n\nCassidy arrived in a whorl of perfume and encouragement and stuck a microphone near his mouth while not looking at him, her show eyes on the lens. She asked him what his cake meant and he told her about thaw, about the bridge, about the way honey dripped in March on his tongue and made him think that maybe he would not sleep forever. She nodded and did that look she had that said she could put what he had said into television without him losing it to edits. \u201cAnd that cat,\u201d she said softly, when her smile was pointed elsewhere and the crowd roared for Abby\u2019s tower, \u201chas a vendetta against equipment. Watch your corners.\u201d\n\nIt was as if Smee had heard his name in the secret frequency cats owned. He appeared from underneath a swath of black drape and leapt onto the lower shelf of Rory\u2019s station with the ease of a creature born spring-loaded. He stared at the cake. Rory stared at him. Two seconds stretched like sugar threads. Then the cat made a small, dismissive snort and strolled away, tail up, a flag of contempt. The audience caught it and laughed the laugh of a city. Rory\u2019s shoulders unclenched by degrees that had names in languages people used mostly for prayers.\n\nPenelope\u2019s showstopper was a bread sculpture that looked like a church had been braided. Jace made something so tall it looked like it resented gravity and had been brought here against its will. Abby\u2019s cake was a polite marvel with little piped flowers the color of good gossip. The heat prickled under Rory\u2019s hair. A curl came loose from the sweat and fell into his eye, and he pushed it back without thinking, smearing a line of frosting across his temple like war paint. Someone near the judges\u2019 table pointed and grinned. He thought, fine, then, let me be a cartoon for you and a baker for me.\n\nWhen time was called the room pushed its breath out and then fought to pull it back in. He set his hands flat on the bench and told them, aloud, barely louder than a whisper, thank you. He had been learned out of religion but kept its habits. The judges came as a set and neither of them tried to smile first. They had taken in the brief. They were ready to intake outcomes. The critic had a pen that matched the color of her shoes. She asked about the shards and he told her what the city did in March, how the river broke and pretended to disappear and came back the same but different. The pastry chef cut a slice with a seriousness that made him stand up straighter. The big-handed baker closed his whole mouth around a bite and then around a second before his hand had come back to the plate, which was really all the statement anyone needed.\n\nThey liked the crumb. They liked the imagined restraint of the icing. They liked the way the lemon refused to be a shout and the walnut refused to be a sulk. The critic said something about the rye, about how it had given the cake a backbone the city would recognize. The pastry chef mentioned the seam, which meant she had found it, which meant she was exactly who he thought she was. The big-handed baker said, \u201cThis eats like a person who works all night and then goes home and remembers why,\u201d and Rory felt, for the second time that day, his eyes get watery for a reason that was not tragedy. They moved on and he watched them go, feeling lighter and also as if he had been carved. He looked up into the house and there it was, the jaw, the lip notch, only now it was undeniably his mother with a plastic cup of something and an expression he had used on himself in mirrors when he tasted too many failures in a row. Next to her Lena held a sign that said Go Augie in letters that had run when she cried. He did not know whether to laugh or to sit down on the floor. He split the difference by widening his mouth in a way that felt like light and did not let out any sound at all.\n\nBackstage while they cut for a commercial he leaned against a rolling cart and breathed into his shirt so as not to fog up any cameras. Dee found him because she could find him in a power outage, and she put her hands on his face like she was checking for fever. He said, \u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d and it was not an accusation, only a piece of news he didn\u2019t know where to put. Dee said, \u201cOf course she is,\u201d and then added, \u201cIf she tries to storm the stage I will tackle her and break two of my bones and hers.\u201d He laughed and it came out like a guided sigh. \u201cYou did good,\u201d she said, simple as that, like she was giving him a drink of water. \u201cIf they don\u2019t know what that tastes like, it\u2019s on their tongues, not yours.\u201d\n\nThey lined up, the four of them, in that alphabet they had become, and the air cooled the sweat on his neck in a way that made him shiver. He watched the screens show the small cut scenes the crew had made of their faces, their hands, their houses from outside, their dogs and snake plants and nephews in soccer jerseys. His own montage included the sink in his apartment, which had not been cleaned enough to satisfy him in this context no matter how he scrubbed it, and the shot of his hands holding the photo of Nana that had made him want to tell the producer to please be kinder to ghosts. Cassidy did that thing where she moved down the line and made each of them look into her face and then into the camera and not trip on the tape at their feet. She asked them how they felt and they lied in sincere voices. He said he was honored and did not say he was also tired in every cell and the kind of wild calm you have when you are just after crying.\n\nDeliberation was quick and long. The judges moved their mouths behind their hands and made notes and then put their pens down and picked them up again because the drama demanded an extra gesture. The stage lights hummed and someone three rows up shouted Woo in the way of a person whose vocabulary had boiled. Smee reappeared like a cameo, sat on the edge of the prize table as if he were guarding the invisible crown, and cleaned his paw with the slow relish of someone who could abolish whole systems by sleeping through them. A production assistant attempted to shoo him with her will and then surrendered and worked around him. Rory felt his heart do a slow, pronounced thing like a drum in a parade no one had asked for. He thought of his oven at home, its tired light, the way it complained when he asked too much. He thought of the woman with the bee hat, of Sammi\u2019s espresso shot like a blessing, of Mrs. Kline\u2019s doorstick and Pickles\u2019 bell, of Lena\u2019s sign with the old name he wore as a bruise and a joke. He thought of Dee\u2019s body, the way it folded around the cart when she leaned, the way she put her mouth next to a plant at four in the morning and told it news.\n\nCassidy returned to the center and lifted her arm in a way that said, all right, we have done what we came here to do. She said the names of the judges in full like incantations, and it occurred to him how much of television was simply saying things with cadence and pretending the air had always sounded like that. She held a card. He thought of his Nana saying, when the heaven television calls, you answer, and he felt a giggle come up the same pipe where he kept his grief. He kept his face under control in the way custodians keep the floors under fluorescent lights, calm, even, a sweep that does not betray the muscle it has cost. Someone behind him cleared their throat; he thought it was Jace and hoped it was not a sob. He touched the bench with his fingertips because he had touches left and no place to put them.\n\nCassidy made a joke that let the crowd exhale impatience in a straight line and then she looked into the camera with both her soul and her training and tore the card open with a scarlet nail. The judges arrays brightened as if on cue. The cat lifted his head and blinked because the envelope made noise that had been designed to interest him. Rory did not move, because moving might jostle the moment, and if you jostled the moment it might spill, and if it spilled the mess would be on his shoes, and he had cleaned enough messes in other people\u2019s shoes to know the sorrow of that. He felt the hall holding its breath in a way that reminded him of ovens and of morning and of how a city can go quiet before it wakes itself violently.\n\nHe saw, as Cassidy drew breath, the shape of a bridge in his head, and he did not know if it was the Roebling or the one between the boy he had been and the man he had let himself become. He knew only that a thing like a voice was about to attach to him, either for a minute or for a while, and that he would go home afterward and stand in his little kitchen with the lamp on and open the jar of honey and let it ribbon into a spoon and taste it, and that the taste would be the same or it would be better or it would be worse and either way he would still make flour move and butter change, and either way he would still tie his shoes and be watched by a cat and pick at a sticker on a plastic bin. He kept his eyes on Cassidy\u2019s mouth because it was the only honest thing in a world of lights. The room leaned toward her like wheat to wind. He did not hear his heart because it had chosen that moment to step into a quieter room and sit down.",

                              "content": "Chapter 4\n\nCassidy said his name in a way that folded and unfolded the room. There was a beat where he thought he had misheard because his own breath came loud, another beat where he saw Penelope\u2019s face in profile, a third where Jace\u2019s hat dipped, a fourth where Abby\u2019s hand went to her mouth to hold in something she did not want to escape. Then his name, undeniable as a stamp, was in the air again and hands were making the sound hands make when they are allowed to forget themselves, and he forgot himself too, not because of winning but because of the wave of the crowd and the way a city can make its own weather.\n\nFor a second he stood exactly where he was, the way you do when a bus arrives while you are still considering your destination. Cassidy reached him first, and the card she had torn was still in her other hand like a dead butterfly. Her dress caught the light, all deliberate shimmer, and her smile made a small serious shape before it arranged itself into the broadcast grin. He wanted not to cry because he had told himself stories about men who did not, and the older story in him, the one that wore Nana\u2019s apron like a vestment, told him not to play coy with joy. He put his palms on the bench, then took them off and opened his arms and the feeling climbed into his chest like a second set of lungs.\n\nCassidy said things into the microphone that became a thin music behind his ears. He saw the trophy on the table\u2014a heavy, funny crown made of brushed metal that looked like the bridge and like the top of a pie crust had had a practical child. A production assistant attempted to lift Smee so the cat would not be formally crowned by accident, and Smee leaped off the cloth with a grace that mocked the concept of gravity and disappeared with his bell shouting behind him. He reached for the metal crown and it was cold, a good cold, the kind that made the palm honest. When they set it on his head for a photograph, he felt ridiculous and then quickly felt something else: the soft click of the story snapping shut around him like a locket.\n\nHe spoke into Cassidy\u2019s microphone and heard himself from a distance, as if he had been recorded long ago and was being played back without his consent. He thanked the judges and the city and the crew and his Nana, who would have said, is there anything left in your mouth when you\u2019re finished with all that thanking, because if there is you didn\u2019t do it right. He said Dee\u2019s name and saw, through the lights, a pair of hands go up and wave like flags. He said custodians out loud and felt his face go warm at the word, the way he always did when he named the job that had kept him steady. He told the cameras the thing he had repeated to himself under his breath for years: do the basics and let them be the miracle. He did not say he was scared every day, because fear would have tried to translate itself into tears and he wanted to be able to see.\n\nThe judges shook his hand in turns. The pastry chef squeezed too hard in a way that proved tender. The critic spoke low in his ear and said, \u201cYou were careful where other people would have been fussy,\u201d and he wondered if that was the most intimate thing anyone had ever told him in public. The big-handed baker slapped his shoulder with a weight that rearranged something in his spine and said, \u201cGo home and sleep and then get up and bake the way you did yesterday and the day before that, and don\u2019t let anyone put their voice in your wrist.\u201d He nodded because his throat had closed.\n\nPenelope hugged him like a cousin at a funeral, all proper back pats and then a squeeze at the end that broke the pattern. \u201cEnjoy your parade,\u201d she said. \u201cThen come eat bread with me sometime and don\u2019t talk about celebrity because my starter will reject you.\u201d\n\nAbby kissed his cheek and left a stamp there that he would discover later in a bathroom mirror and laugh at, like a cartoon bruise. \u201cDo not ever admit that you almost flamb\u00e9ed your own eyebrows with a torch,\u201d she said. \u201cWait at least two years.\u201d\n\nJace took his hand and held it in both of his, an old-man gesture that looked comical on his young face. \u201cTell your sister to put my hat on her dog,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was some cake, Grady. The shards were a risk. They paid rent.\u201d\n\nThe house lights shifted and he felt the temperature change on his skin. He looked up toward the cheap seats, the ones that had given him his lungs, and found Lena because she was standing and because she did not sit when she should. She had made her sign from the wrong kind of cardboard and it had bowed in the middle where the condensation from her drink had touched it. Next to her was the jaw and the notch and the laugh lines a person gets from practicing an expression even when there is no one to practice it for. His mother\u2019s mouth was not moving. It was a line it made when it had to hold a lot of words that would otherwise be loose. He did not wave because if he did he feared he would make of this moment a different piece of theater than the city had paid for, but he allowed himself the smallest nod, a hinge you couldn\u2019t see at a distance.\n\nBackstage he handed the crown to a production assistant so he could wash his hands and then took it back and set it on top of a rolling rack where the cool metal could remind him what a joke looked like made into object. Dee found him in the squeezing sea of bodies and fitted herself to him like a brace, her arms firm around his ribs, her chin a weight on his shoulder for a second and then gone. She did not say congratulations the way people say it like a balloon; she said, \u201cI knew,\u201d and he believed that, not because anybody knows anything but because she had spoken over his head in a way he had come to associate with miracles. She inspected his face with a nurse\u2019s eye and licked her thumb and wiped a streak of frosting off his temple the same way she had once wiped something worse from a stranger\u2019s cheek in a hallway. \u201cYou have to show your teeth to some microphones. Do not gargle. Articulate. And for the love of somebody\u2019s god, don\u2019t let them convince you to cry on cue.\u201d\n\nThe press room had been made out of a rehearsal space. It smelled like coffee and hairspray and excitement that had a price. He sat in a chair that spun slightly even when he did not make it, a minor carnival ride he regretted instantly. There were flashes. There were questions that were the same question wearing different shirts. How did it feel. What would he do next. Did he have a sweetheart and was the sweetheart available for a reaction shot. He spoke the way he baked, trying to parcel out sugar and salt in reasonable measures. He did not say what he had thought of saying, which was that he had been trying for so much less than this for so long, and that sometimes less had been too stubborn to be caught. He said Nana again and felt like he was pushing the edges of her name with a finger to see where it would bruise. Cassidy slid in and out, corralling and flirting and holding space with the expertise of someone who could make a room think it was a good room to be.\n\nWhen the crew released him from his public, he went to the edge of a hallway and stood in a shadow near a mop closet out of habit, and that was where Lena found him. She barreled into the shadow as if it had been designed to fit her. The ponytail slapped his collarbone and she punched his chest with her small and lethal knuckles, not because she was mad but because she didn\u2019t have an organ for how proud she was and had to use her knuckles as a substitute.\n\n\u201cAugie,\u201d she said, and he wanted to tell her that the name was an old coat you only put on for family, and then he thought of the sign and felt the cheap cardboard bow again in his chest. \u201cYou idiot. You did it. You made me cry in front of a man with a bucket of popcorn the size of Wyoming. I hate you. I love you.\u201d\n\nHe held her in a way that had to be adjusted to fit the metal crown she craned to inspect and then refused to touch. \u201cLena,\u201d he said, and her name made his voice smaller. \u201cDid she\u2014did you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe came,\u201d Lena said. \u201cI brought her because if I had not she would have found a way to arrive wrong. She did good. She sat. She didn\u2019t yell anything you\u2019ll have to die with. She wants to see you if you want that. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll tell her we have to take a detour on the way home because the bridge is out, and then I\u2019ll drive her to Indiana and make her do shots with a man who sells knives.\u201d\n\nHe laughed and then felt the prickle behind his eyes again. He had promised himself he would not cry in a room where people could harvest it for B-roll, so he looked at a fire extinguisher and said, \u201cFive minutes. I can do five.\u201d\n\nLena pressed her mouth to his jaw and then went to fetch their mother, who came like a person walking down a church aisle and then remembered she was not the bride. She had put on lipstick like a decision. Her hair was a nest that had refused to be reinterpreted and he was glad of that, ridiculous as it was. She stopped ten feet away and put her hand to her mouth and dropped it and put it back. The line in her face was not as hard as it had been the last time he had allowed himself to be seen. He did not know what to do with his hands and so he tucked them into his own elbows like a cold person will.\n\n\u201cYou look like him,\u201d she said, and then scolded herself for bringing that ghost into the hall, her eyes cutting sideways as if a camera would catch the thought and sell it. \u201cYou did good, Rory. You looked \u2026 you looked like yourself. I was proud. If a person is allowed to be proud. You know I don\u2019t know the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no rules,\u201d he said, and knew immediately that this was a lie they had all built rooms on. \u201cThank you for coming. You didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to see you when you were the size the world says you are. I don\u2019t want to miss anymore sized moments if I can help it. I could help it before. I can\u2019t now. It\u2019s not a speech. It\u2019s just true.\u201d She reached and then stopped. \u201cI won\u2019t. I won\u2019t touch unless you\u2026 I know you wear your old name like a brand some days.\u201d\n\nHe stepped into the reach because he did not know what he would do with the feeling if he kept it. Her hands smelled like some old bar soap and a sweet drink that had no fruit in it. The embrace lasted the length of a small song. When they stepped back he saw the wetness at the edge of her eyes and his mouth made a shape that could have been a laugh if someone else had done it.\n\n\u201cDo you want to come up after?\u201d he asked, surprising himself with his mouth\u2019s boldness. \u201cI made rolls. The cinnamon sort. They aren\u2019t fancy.\u201d\n\nShe flinched at fancy like a gnat had flown at her eye. \u201cI won\u2019t darken your door. Not tonight. I\u2019ll just go home with your sister and not make her turn the radio on if she doesn\u2019t want it, I swear. But I\u2019ll take a roll if you make me, because I\u2019ll die otherwise not knowing if they taste like your Nana\u2019s. She would have eaten me alive if I\u2019d said they did. She\u2019d have said, Lucille, your tongue is a lazy thing.\u201d\n\nLena appeared behind their mother\u2019s shoulder and made an exaggerated nodding motion that meant, Good, good, this is not a bad thing, nobody is on fire, I will keep the fire extinguisher and you get the rolls. He said he would bring the pan to the stage door and she could take it like contraband. He touched the metal crown because it was easier than touching anything else and then let the press swallow him again for a few last bites.\n\nHe had his picture taken with the crew because he had promised himself he would, and with the lighting technicians who had made him into a person and not a lamp, and with Cassidy, who whispered, \u201cWe can cut the part where I forgot which side your camera loves. You are a charm. Enjoy your nap.\u201d He found the tray of sweet rolls and transferred most of them to a box because it was psychologically easier to give away a box than a pan. On his way to the stage door he passed Smee sitting on the center chair of a row meant for cellists like he had bought a ticket and written a letter about the seat he required. The cat flicked his tail when he saw Rory\u2019s box and made the particular face of a being who had hoped for salmon and been handed bread. \u201cWe can\u2019t all be pleased,\u201d Rory told him, as if the cat worked on his shift and not for the universe.\n\nOutside, the air had shifted into a softer register, the kind that made your skin grateful for having been scrubbed. He handed the box to Lena, who held it like a prize, and to his mother, who took one roll right then and bit into it with the theatricality of a judge on a show that did not exist. The two of them made noises like television and then the noises quieted and the look on their faces went private, and he stood for a second and watched them have what he hoped they were having, which was not nostalgia so much as a small green shoot of mercy.\n\nBy the time he got home, the crown under his arm like a large expensive book he did not plan to read, the neighborhood had shed its concert clothes and put on laundry. A man across the street was hosing his stairs with an attention that suggested he had borrowed the water. The trumpet player on the corner was practicing scales and failing to be embarrassed. He lugged the crown up the stairs as if it contained sand. Mrs. Kline\u2019s door creaked open like a theatrical cue.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d she said, as if he had been out shopping and had to tell her whether the store still carried her favorite brand of canned peaches. He lifted the metal in his hand and her mouth did something unplanned and then she made it into a snort. \u201cFigures,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my tenants are going to get famous they may as well do it for sweets and not podcasts. Let me see your head. Did they make you wear that like a toddler. I\u2019ll get the cat. He too deserves to be humiliated.\u201d\n\nPickles waltzed into the hall fat with approval and knocked his bell against the baseboard on purpose. The cat slalomed between Rory\u2019s ankles as if to say, explain yourself. Rory bent and touched one orange ear with two fingers and said, \u201cWe did a thing.\u201d The cat stared at him with pupils like coins and then butted his head into the crown with an insulted acceptance that made Mrs. Kline wheeze her laugh. \u201cI knew you could,\u201d she said, and the way she said could made him feel he had lifted something significant from her as well as from himself.\n\nHe set the crown on the kitchen table and it settled there in a disconcertingly official way, like a city seal. He turned on the lamp with the soft click and opened his window onto a small square of evening and stood with his hand on the sill until the breeze cooled the sweat in his hair. The apartment smelled of sugar that had receded and the slight bitter he got when his oven had been too ambitious. He poured a glass of water and did not drink from it right away. He leaned his head against the cabinet and kept his eyes open in case his face tried to do its own thing.\n\nHis phone buzzed like a wasp in a jar. There were texts he could scroll. There were emails he could pretend to answer. There were two voicemails from unknown numbers that had the tone of opportunity wearing a suit. He put the phone on the table next to the crown and went to wash bowls instead. It had been what saved him. It could save him again. The dishwater went cloudy fast and the plate with the frosting smears released them as if the day had always been ready to turn clean. He imagined the stagehands eating the last of the rolls with their heads together, not talking at all but taking the sweetness like the way a person will map their own route home.\n\nWhen he had put the last bowl in the rack; when he had wiped the counter, then wiped it again; when he had arranged his piping tips in a line and put them back in a box because you put away sharp things when you are tired; when he had sat on the floor with his back against the cabinet and closed his eyes and put his palms flat on the cool linoleum\u2014the knock came. It was the polite two and a half of someone with manners and a history of being ignored.\n\nHe stood and did not put his hand to his hair because there was nothing hair could do to help. On the other side of the door was the beekeeper woman in her ridiculous hat like a constellation. She was panting, which made the hat bob, and she had a jar in her hand.\n\n\u201cI watched on television,\u201d she said, each word dragging a small invisible cart. \u201cThis is the good stuff, the stuff I don\u2019t sell unless you ask me in a certain voice, which you did without knowing today. I thought you might want to celebrate wrong. With toast or something. I don\u2019t know how you people do it. I know how bees do. They dance. They move figure-eights and tell each other where the flowers are. You should probably dance but you probably won\u2019t, being Irish and male and ruined by church. So take this. I charge fifty. I will not take your money. That is how you accept a gift.\u201d\n\nHe took the jar and it was warm like a hand. He looked through it at the kitchen light and saw gold turned into a mood. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you a cake,\u201d he said, because that was the only language he had for that kind of kindness. \u201cYou\u2019ll hate it. But you\u2019ll pretend otherwise.\u201d\n\nShe cackled and the hat shook again. \u201cBless you, boy,\u201d she said, and down the stairs she went, calling her feet bad names in a way that suggested they were used to it.\n\nHe thought, vaguely, that he should sleep for a week and then open a bakery by accident. He thought, more precisely, that he had to tell Dee first if he was going to change anything, because you don\u2019t walk off a night shift without a salute. He set the honey on the counter like a small altar and took out the bread he had bought because he thought he might need crumbs and did not. He made toast and the oven tried to talk him out of it by failing to ignite cleanly and then consenting to burn the corners. He poured honey like a slow mistake and ate standing up, each bite a simple returning. He let himself think, very softly, that he had earned this not because of television or crown or crowd, but because he had done the basics until they formed a life without permission.\n\nHe woke at four out of an old habit and because joy shares a bed badly. He pulled on his work pants and felt for the familiar weight of keys that had marked him for so long he sometimes thought of them as jewelry. He wrote a note in pencil to himself with the three things he\u2019d thought of in the night like thieves: parchment paper, new apron, call producer back only after coffee. He looked at the crown on his table and laughed at it, not unkindly. He left it there to watch the window with the serious expression of a person guarding a small country.\n\nDee was in the lobby of their building with her cart already loaded, her travel mug steaming, her earrings from last night turned back into small loops. She cocked her head and narrowed her eyes and then smiled in the way you smile at a story you already know. \u201cWe get to clean the story,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine that. I\u2019m going to polish that conference table with my face.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sleep,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI sleep. I nap sideways. That counts as sleep at my age. I watched you and then I made spaghetti and then Pickles came to the window and told me a fight story in his little bell. He has an enemy who is a possum now. Things are happening.\u201d She wrapped his knuckles with her fingers in a quick blessing. \u201cYou take today easy as you can. They\u2019ll want you to go on the morning show and then the noon news and then some radio where a man tells you about sin and traffic. Pick what lets you be a person and not a picture.\u201d\n\nThey wheeled their carts through the predawn quiet that had been his anyway. The building accepted him the way a familiar room accepts a changed thing: by making the change feel ordinary while not pretending not to notice. The air on the twelfth floor was thick with yesterday and every day, carpet and coffee, air registers that had been neglected by a budget, the chemical chill of glass cleaner. He breathed it like bread. When he put his mop down and began, the sound belonged to him again. The bucket rolled over a ridged tile and made the thrum that always reminded him of a song he could never name.\n\nThey did not speak for twenty minutes. The mops took the conversation. The streaks diminished. Dee refilled her bottle and whistled a single tuneless line because she had whistled that line every day he had known her. When they reached the north windows, he stood and looked out. The river lay in its bed with dignity, unbothered by any crowns people had tried on in its name. A barge moved with the implacability he envied. Over Covington, two kitchen lights came on at once like a signal someone had forgotten how to read. He thought of his shards of sugar placed to mimic the ice and felt a fond embarrassment, the way you do when you hear yourself laugh on a recording.\n\n\u201cYou gonna quit?\u201d Dee asked, not adding the word me because she was practicing generosity as a sport.\n\nHe wrung the mop without looking at it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to. Not immediately. They might tell me I have to if I\u2019m going to pretend to be a person in a magazine for a little while. But this is my\u2026 this is my breathing. I\u2019ll try to do both until the seams show. Then I\u2019ll come make you promise not to get mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get mad,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can do it softly. Circus light mad. Not house fire mad. If you leave, we will have a good cry in the supply closet like civilized colleagues and then I\u2019ll throw you under the bus to new hires for a month and then I\u2019ll brag. I\u2019m proud of you, kid. I\u2019m proud in my bones. I\u2019ll deny it if anyone repeats me.\u201d\n\nHe nodded because to say thank you would have made the air too thin.\n\nBy nine the world had found him again with a different voice. The producer called with a list that sounded like a grocery run written by a person with an addiction to nouns. He said yes to the radio with the kind man who did not make him explain his family on air. He said no to the breakfast show that wanted him to make a five-minute pastry in a pan shaped like a heart. He said yes to the newspaper photographer who wanted to meet him in front of the blue tile wall on Vine and photograph his hands. He said maybe to a roundtable with the other finalists, because he wanted to sit beside Penelope and be a person with bread jokes in a public place.\n\nHe went to Sammi\u2019s caf\u00e9 and the chalkboard had a hasty crown drawn on it like a child had gotten ahold of chalk and joy. Sammi rang a bell he kept under the counter for people who over-tipped or brought good gossip. Patrons looked up and clapped because the bell told them to. The espresso this morning tasted like somebody had polished the machine. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you a deal,\u201d Sammi said, eyes bright, hair going in six directions because it had been excited too. \u201cPop-up here. Midnight buns. One week. I\u2019ll work the door so nobody assaults you. We\u2019ll call it Night Custard and pretend that\u2019s a business plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cNight Custard,\u201d he repeated, because he loved the way words could be stupid and perfect. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to get a bouncer who knows how to shoo grandmothers and men with opinions about rye.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a man with opinions about rye,\u201d Sammi said. \u201cHe is my landlord. He is also my father. He can\u2019t lift anything but his eyebrows. He can raise those so high it knocks a person over. Bring bread, boy. Bring sugared things that make people forgive their parents for an hour.\u201d\n\nThey chose a night like you choose a door. They drew a flier with a pen that bled. They told three people who would tell the entire city because the city wanted to be told. He left with his head full of the particular anxiety of abundance, the kind that made his teeth hum. He walked past the German restaurant where Penelope\u2019s bread lived and pressed his nose to the glass because a person who loves yeast is a dog sometimes. On the street he passed a man selling strawberries that were the wrong month and the wrong smell and could only be lies. He did not judge; he bought one because the red made his mouth thirsty. He ate it and let the sweet pretend. He tossed the stem in a trash can with the confidence of a man with transferable skills.\n\nBy late afternoon he had said enough words to strangers to need a small dark. He took his crown down from the table because Pickles had jumped up and knocked it with the disdain of a monarch disappointed by a cousin. He set it on the refrigerator where the magnet with Nana\u2019s recipe could look at it when she was bored. He pulled the recipe drawer open and ran his finger along cards that had acquired grease halos like saint pictures. He chose three that would not betray him to night air: the honey walnut cake, now a thing that belonged to the room as much as to him; a tart the color of a clean sunrise; and a roll that was not schnecken but would nod in a respectful direction. He made notes on a scrap of an old memo from the cleaning schedule because paper had layers like cake and he loved to stack their uses.\n\nIn the evening his phone rang with a name he did not expect and was not ready for. Cassidy. He took the call standing by the window because he had discovered that if he stood by the window while talking to famous people he could see the river and remember he had a body.\n\n\u201cYou were good television,\u201d she said without greeting. \u201cYou were better bakery. Those two aren\u2019t often the same. I\u2019m calling not to recruit you for a ridiculous thing where we make winners cook over an open fire in high winds, though that will happen and you should say no. I\u2019m calling because we have a series of off-air events that shuffle money into hands that need it. A fundraiser for the culinary program at a public school. A bake sale for a shelter that wants a new oven. If I paste your name to a flier, people who wouldn\u2019t come will. Will you stand in rooms and let people eat you in bites.\u201d\n\nHe smiled because the phrasing pleased him even as it made him wince. \u201cYes. Mostly. If I\u2019m allowed to bring a friend who will swat me when my face goes wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can bring a battalion,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, prepare yourself for men with clipboards who want to take you to Los Angeles. You are allowed to say no to them. They will interpret no as foreplay. Let me know if you need someone in a dress to say a legal phrase near their kneecaps.\u201d\n\nHe thought about his apartment and the crown on the refrigerator and the cat who had opinions about bells. \u201cI think what I want is to open a place called Night Custard for a week and let people eat sweet rolls at midnight until the police ask us to be reasonable. After that, I might stand in a school cafeteria and torch marshmallow for children who have never watched their sugar go glass.\u201d\n\nCassidy made a delighted noise that had nothing to do with cameras. \u201cThis is why you were good bakery,\u201d she said. \u201cSend me pictures of your pop-up. I\u2019ll post them and let the city pretend we are close. And Rory\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cBuy comfortable shoes. You are about to stand a lot more than you sit. And when you sit, people will sit on parts of you.\u201d\n\nAfter they hung up he sat on the floor again because the floor did not ask anything. He put his palm on the linoleum and felt, absurdly, like he could feel the river through the old wood and older concrete, like a pulse that would be there when he pulled his hand away. He had a memory unspool without asking permission: him at twelve, Nana\u2019s hand on his head, flour in the air like a weather system, her voice telling him in a soft imperative to leave it alone once it looked like a cloud. He said aloud, in his empty kitchen, to the crown and to the river and to the cat who might have his ear at the door, \u201cOkay,\u201d and meant it more ways than one.\n\nTwo days later Night Custard began as a joke and turned, by eleven-thirty, into a line that curled around the block like a sentence that wouldn\u2019t end. Sammi had bought rope stanchions from an event rental because he did not trust the civility of the city after ten p.m. He had given them codenames for when his voice had to reach only a certain distance: Rye, Lemon, Walnut, Bee. The chalkboard out front read: Midnight Rolls for Night Workers and Anyone Who Has Ever Held a Mop. Dee stood at the door with a stack of diner plates and the attitude of a woman who had removed children from danger and was not afraid to remove adults too.\n\nRory baked in the back with sleeves rolled up and hair tied with a strip of clean dish towel. He had borrowed a restaurant\u2019s convection oven that sang in a key he did not know. He rolled dough while Sammi\u2019s espresso machine flared like gossip. Steam clung to his neck; flour flourished on his forearms in pale smudges. He plated, he brushed, he drizzled honey with the small meanness you keep for good things. Every third person who received a roll told him a story about a grandmother, and every story bent the same way at the end, toward a kitchen and a light and a person you couldn\u2019t keep.\n\nAt one, the firefighters from the station down the block came in with the polite swagger that belonged to men and women who owned helmets. They bought a dozen and carried them like they were relics. At one-thirty, a woman in scrubs with blood on her shoe and glitter in her hair from some child\u2019s birthday came and ordered two, one to eat there and one to sneak into a fridge labeled Nurses. At two, three boys who had no business being awake and would not be told otherwise came in and took pictures of their faces behind the rolls until Sammi took their phones and said, \u201cEat now. Photograph later. There are rules in a place like this. They are all about sugar.\u201d\n\nDee wandered behind the counter and bumped him with her hip. \u201cYou\u2019re a menace,\u201d she said, looking pleased and exhausted. \u201cThe city is lit like a birthday and you did that little bit. Do not let it go to your head or I\u2019ll knock it out with a tray.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen do I sleep,\u201d he asked, not really asking.\n\n\u201cWhen you remember you have a bed,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t get bouncy. Bouncy is for children. You are a steady man with a crown on his refrigerator. Keep your ankles under you. Watch your laces. Pickles is going to trip you on purpose because he resents your new fame.\u201d\n\nAt three, the beekeeper arrived with her hat like an eclipse and a canvas bag that had the sort of mysterious weight that said emergency. She took off the hat like a burden and put it on a chair and ate with the intensity of a person who had earned anything she wanted to want. After her second roll she put two jars on the counter like an offering. \u201cThe bees approve,\u201d she said around a mouthful. \u201cThey want to know if you\u2019ll keep using them. Don\u2019t answer. Just keep buying jars from a woman with a hat and I\u2019ll read that as yes.\u201d\n\nAt four, the line thinned as the night did that thing it does right before morning, the breathing out, the preparation to hand the day to day. Sammi counted cash with his tongue in his cheek. The espresso machine sighed like an animal heading for bed. Rory cleaned his station as if the cameras were watching and were also kind. He wrapped the last roll of the night for a boy asleep at a table who had come with his mother and had put his head down and dreamed while the room made a sound he would remember as a flavor.\n\nWhen he stepped outside to feel the five o\u2019clock on his cheeks, there was a shape outlined against the glass. The brick-colored cat sat on Sammi\u2019s window ledge with his paws tucked into his chest, his bell a weight on his collar, his eyes like slits that still saw. Smee looked at Rory and Rory looked at Smee and the air made a truce. The cat jumped down with a view toward entropy and trotted away, tail up, like a prince who had inspected a new province and found it acceptable.\n\nHe went home with his apron in a bag and flour in his eyebrows and the loose proud ache that only stands in your legs when you have been useful for hours on end. In his hallway he heard Mrs. Kline snoring like a small saw. Pickles lay on his back with his stomach out and his eyes closed, a seduction and a trap. Rory stepped carefully because he loved his ankles. In his kitchen, the crown on the refrigerator had become a normal object, the way even remarkable things do when you keep them near. He set his palms on the table not in prayer but in the habit of it.\n\nSometime later, when he did sleep, the dream he had was not one of disaster. He dreamed he stood on the Suspension Bridge and the river below was a loaf that had risen perfectly, a brown you only get by not opening the oven too soon. He walked across as if crossing a kitchen and on the other side there was a lamp lit like a good joke, and a woman with flour on her cheek who told him, in a voice that was his too, that he had measured enough for today. She handed him a towel and he dried his hands and woke with the tang of lemon in his mouth, and for once, for a long second that felt like the length of a loaf cooling, he did not scramble for the next thing. He lay there and let his breath do what it had learned. Outside, the river went about its business and the sun came up and the city thought, why not, and began again.",

It sat on the refrigerator and made the humming of the motor feel ceremonial, which was useless and also a little funny. He found himself drying his hands on a towel and then glancing up at it as if it might be taking notes, as if it might press itself into the soft of his day and leave an imprint he would have to honor. He went to work because work asked in the same steady voice it always had. He pushed the cart and mopped the path light took, and Dee pretended not to watch him for cracks in his attention like a mason testing a new wall with his knuckles. Night Custard happened in three more installments without anyone getting arrested, which Sammi declared a miracle, and which Rory declared an inevitability if you fed a city sugar with respect and some kind of music. His phone began to behave like a pot near a boil; it made small noises and little vibrations and tried to keep him running. He answered what felt human and gave himself up to the slow rejection of the rest, deleting offers for shows with titles like Dough Or Dare and politely saying no to a documentary that wanted to catch him sleeping because that would be raw.\n\nThere were practicalities to answer that did not care whether you were lit by stage lights. Health, safety, permits, the holy trinity of the nervous and righteous. A man with a clipboard and the startling eyelashes of a calf appeared during Night Custard number four and asked to see documentation and then, because Sammi charmed him into a seat with a roll and a latte he did not want, asked if Rory had thought of a permanent kitchen. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this forever,\u201d the man said, chewing like a person who knew pleasure and had agreed to like this too. \u201cPop-ups are like those men who tell you they are between things. The city will get jealous if you flirt with it and then refuse to say yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetween things is a place,\u201d Rory said, because he had occupied it for the length of several apartments. \u201cBut yes. I am thinking about a room I can sweep and lock and leave flour in without having to apologize to espresso fans.\u201d\n\n\u201cFind a hood system that doesn\u2019t sound like a rock band,\u201d the man said, rising with a sigh. \u201cAnd put your sink where a tired person will forgive it. I like you. I will like you better on paper.\u201d\n\nRory did not tell him that paper had been imagining him in rooms for years. He told him he would consider a hood devoutly and then sent a text to Penelope because she was a person who owned proofs and also proofing cabinets. She wrote back with a picture of a walk-in cooler that had outlived at least one marriage and a caption that said, Come look at our old annex kitchen before the landlord repurposes it into artisanal axe-throwing. He tucked that invitation into the same pocket where he had tucked every invitation that felt like a door.\n\nWhen he wasn\u2019t arranging yeast in bowls at midnight or aligning trash bags like uniforms at four a.m., he walked. He made little loops of city the way a person makes loops of yarn while trying to remember a story their grandmother told once and never again. On one of those walks he found a narrow space on Twelfth, a former shoe repair store whose windows arched like eyebrows and whose floor, visible through the dusty glass, was a patchwork of tile and plywood that looked like it had been mended with love and impatience. The For Lease sign had a number with a name under it: W. D. Engel & Sons, which was either a dynasty or a hopeful fiction. He called and got a woman who said her name like a formula, the efficiency of four generations condensed into a vowel. \u201cYou can look at it on Tuesday,\u201d she said, after he admitted that his business plan was a napkin and his capital a collection of friends and a jar of honey. \u201cBring a flashlight. The light switches are decorative for now.\u201d\n\nHe brought Dee because he did not do new rooms without her if he could help it. She walked into the dim and sniffed the air like a dog in a hallway. \u201cDry,\u201d she said, tapping the wall with her knuckles. \u201cGood bones. Bad outlets. There\u2019s a slope to the floor near the back that will make you swear when you are balancing a sheet pan full of anything. It smells like leather and old glue. That\u2019s not a bad thing for the first year of a place. It\u2019s got discipline built in.\u201d\n\nThe landlord\u2019s granddaughter arrived with keys and a binder that looked heavier than some of the tenants. She looked at Rory\u2019s crown on the refrigerator in his photos and did not mention it, which made him like her a little. \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate on rent,\u201d she said, flipping to a page that revealed numbers that made his stomach do the math in exclamation points. \u201cBut we negotiate on months before rent when the landlord is feeling fatherly and believes in a thing. Do you have a thing that can make a man in suspenders loosen them.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d Rory said, and set the baker\u2019s dozen of schnecken on the counter as if he had practiced this and, in a way, had. \u201cAnd an idea. Midnight buns for people who sweep, for people who deliver, for people who pour, for people who shut off the lights and then have to turn around and turn them on again.\u201d\n\nThe woman took a roll and examined it the way a person examines a small piece of jewelry. She bit and her eyes did the thing eyes do when the mathematician inside them sets down a pencil. \u201cSuspender man is my father,\u201d she said, when she had swallowed. \u201cHe has strong opinions about butter and about young people being lazy which I don\u2019t share. He will say this is too sweet. I will tell him he is at war with joy. He will then compromise because my child calls him Honey Bear and he goes soft for that kind of nonsense. Finish cleaning your cabinets this week. We\u2019ll talk.\u201d\n\nIt was progress that felt like being handed a bridge in pieces and a glue gun. He wrote a list that looked like a parade: quotes for hoods, PLC-covered painters versus the friend who would do it for half a cake, plumbing men, electrician women, industrial shelves with a patience that almost made you forgive their ugliness. He stuck the list to the wall with tape he would regret later and then left the space to breathe because he had seen kitchens die when men loved them too loudly before they were ready.\n\nIn between the logistics he went to the school on the West Side because Cassidy asked him to and because she promised him a cafeteria that smelled like corn and teenage soap. The culinary program\u2019s teacher had a voice like a coach and the hair of a person who had chosen not to fight their curls anymore. She stood him up in front of a dozen kids who hid their nervousness in hoods and eyeliner and the practiced shrug of a person who has decided they will not clap for a man with a crown they didn\u2019t ask for. He told them about dough in the bakery voice that he used when he wanted to quell panic and he told them about custodial work in the voice he used when he wanted to raise attention. He said flour and butter and sugar and eggs and saw a boy in the back lift his head like those four words were four notes from a song his mother had sung. They made pretzels with too much salt and a dough that stuck stubborn in the bends until he coaxed the kids to let it be ugly for a minute and then trust their own hands. The girl with the eyeliner asked him if television was fake and he told her it was true with wardrobe. He watched two of the boys stand a little taller when he told them his wrists had learned this long after his mouth did. No one swooned and no one pretended to; they put the pretzels in brown paper bags and walked back to classes like you walk out of a church, eyes squinting at the light as if it will charge a fee.\n\nOn the way out he passed a display case with trophies behind glass and the dust of decades on top. The janitor\u2019s cart leaned against the wall outside the principal\u2019s office like a parked car, and the man pushing it had the posture of someone who remembered his body after the first hour and didn\u2019t need to be reminded again. Rory stopped and said the thing he always said to men and women whose hands made it possible for people to pretend things were clean by magic. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he said. \u201cLooks like a long one.\u201d The man glanced at his shoes, looked up to Rory\u2019s face, then down to the key ring on his belt and shook it once like a bell. \u201cIsn\u2019t it always,\u201d he said, smiling in a plain way that made their feet choose the same rhythm for a second. Cassidy caught up to him at the door and tapped his shoulder with a little stack of thank-you notes printed on paper that still smelled like hot toner. \u201cKeep these,\u201d she said, as if he had tried to hand them back. \u201cThe city is writing you small love letters. Don\u2019t get greedy, but don\u2019t throw them away.\u201d\n\nHe saw his mother three times in two weeks and every time she arrived less winded by the idea. The first time they met her on Lena\u2019s porch, perched on a plastic chair that wheezed when she shifted. He handed her a plate and she pretended not to apologize to it, as if plates kept tallies. The second time she showed up at Night Custard at ten fifty-five with a man from the bowling alley who had known him since he had been shorter than a mop. \u201cWe are old,\u201d she announced to the room, which had not asked and clapped anyway, \u201cand we want sugar.\u201d He saw the way she glanced at the crown pinned to a corkboard like a butterfly, how her mouth threatened to turn down and then changed its mind. The third time she knocked on his apartment door at four in the afternoon with a bag of groceries and a handful of recipes that had traveled folded in someone else\u2019s purse long enough to matter. She said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to let me in,\u201d and then entered anyway because in their family a threshold was a suggestion like a speed limit. They made meatloaf that fought them and green beans that refused to take on personality, and they ate, knees touching the coffee table, plates on bare wood, letting the television talk for them until it didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter she left, he stood in his kitchen with his hands wet and thought about how forgiveness was like honey in that it did not solve bread but made it easier to finish. He did not think the word forgive out loud because it would have tried to put itself into his mouth with sticky hands. He sent Lena a picture of the sink and the plates leaning like tired men on each other. She wrote back a string of hearts and a picture of their mother asleep in an armchair with a new softness around the mouth, the kind babies get when they give up crying for a history they don\u2019t know how to hold.\n\nOn a Saturday that held itself like it had been taught manners, the beekeeper called him and said, in the flat panicked voice of a person who had taught themselves calm, \u201cThe bees are leaving.\u201d He arrived in a rapid walk that would have been a run a year ago and saw a cloud that was not cloud. The air in front of the bee boxes shivered and rewrote itself and then moved, a collective decision that made the hair on his arms try to salute. The woman stood with a cardboard box and a white sheet like a bride at a farm wedding. \u201cThey do this,\u201d she said, in case he thought he was about to lose a friend. \u201cThey find a queen and make a traveling house. They\u2019ll choose a branch. Then we have to convince them they meant to land in this box.\u201d\n\nHe was not a man to argue with insects with better choreography than his. He held the sheet the way she wanted and then kneeled when she told him to, and they moved like a duo that had not rehearsed but had a talent for not stepping on each other\u2019s feet. The bees settled in a curly cluster on a low branch that looked like an ornament, like someone had hung a living purse from the tree for lack of imagination. The beekeeper spoke to them in a tone that was half hymn and half gossip, and Rory found himself holding his breath at intervals as if not to jostle their choices. When the box was under the branch and the sheet was less sheet than stage, the woman shook the branch with a vigor that would have scattered lesser creatures. The bees fell in a mass that did not hit like water but like a sack filled with a liquid that remembered air. They gathered again and spilled again and then, as if remembering their queen\u2019s perfume, moved their small bodies into a tide heading down. He felt one knock against his wrist and he thought of all the kitchens he had made into something else and he imagined the bees looking at him with eyes that did not need advice and said, without words, We know how to make something out of sugar and need with our bodies. It was three minutes and also an afternoon. When the lid was on and the holes were open and the noise changed register the beekeeper let out a breath that paid off several old debts. \u201cThat\u2019s how you do it,\u201d she said, leaning against his shoulder like a sister. \u201cThat\u2019s how you move a crowd without yelling.\u201d\n\nHe took the feeling back to the Twelfth Street space and set it on a shelf like a jar of spice. He and Sammi measured the counters with a tape that would not stay put, and he and Dee marked the walls with blue painter\u2019s tape where the ovens would live and where the sinks would have to insist. He signed a paper with the granddaughter and her father and got their name wrong and they forgave him because his hand kept shaking. He spent a long morning with a plumber named Cherise who said, without looking up from the maw of a pipe, \u201cDo not let tile men tell you that grout is sealant. Grout is toothpaste. It gets dirty and cries.\u201d He put in an order for sheet pans that made him feel as if he either were planning a party for a town or had decided to take up a sport in which aluminum was the primary opponent. He stood at the back door and saw the narrow alley and the part of the sky that was his and the sound of the dumpsters rolling like ships in harbor, and he had to hold his breath until his lungs forgave his heart.\n\nIt was about then that the article came out, because if there is joy there must be a piece of paper attached that makes it official. The paper put his face above a headline that made him want to crawl into Dee\u2019s supply closet and not come out until the ink flaked off. The writer was better than the headline, and had the grace to ask him about the mops before the ovens. She sat with him while he made dough and did not pretend to know what the words meant when he talked about crumb structure and she wrote down Nana with the apostrophe he put in it when he was tired. The photographs did not make him look like a deer, which he appreciated, and one of them caught his hands in a blur that looked like rehearsal for flight. The part he liked best surprised him: a picture of Dee in a hallway, her hand on a plant like she was telling it a secret and the plant was smarter than the people who had left their signatures on a glass wall. The caption called her his mentor and she snorted when she saw it and then kept the paper under the bed like girls keep magazines about hair and possibility.\n\nThe article made the line at Night Custard longer and a little shinier. It brought a consultant with white teeth and no socks who wanted to give him money in exchange for his name on fifty boxes in cities that did not have this river and this weather and this Dee. It brought a couple from Indian Hill who wanted to \u201ccurate\u201d him into a lifestyle brand with bees on the label and a story about walnuts that felt like a poem about someone else\u2019s grandfather. It brought a man who had known his father and whose eyebrows tried to warn him before his mouth did, and it brought a woman with a blog who took pictures of her food like a mother who did not trust her babysitter. He smiled until his mouth asked for a reprieve, and then he went to the back and leaned his head against the cool side of the walk-in and begged the metal to teach him how to be cold in a kind way.\n\nThrough all of it, the work was itself. He turned out rolls at midnight until his arms discovered a new kind of fatigue that felt like a song you learn without sheet music. He wiped counters with the muscle memory of a monk in a kitchen that had to be clean by dawn. He took his crown to a fundraiser at a vocational school on the East Side and raised his torch over a tray of meringue while a boy told him he could not stop burning sugar because it looked like magic he could control. He stood in a church basement and served tart to a line of men who would not make eye contact and then did because he said their names like a spell. He took a day off because Dee told him to and found himself at the river at eight in the morning watching a barge push against the current like a man who will not be told no by a stubborn cupboard, and he pressed his palms to the cold metal railing and breathed through his mouth like a swimmer.\n\nThe week the hood went in he fought with the electrician about ducts and with the inspector about hand-washing signs and with his own brain about whether butter was a reason to lose sleep. He went to the German restaurant early and stood in the annex with Penelope and watched steam pour from the dishwasher like a genie that had decided to bless plates. She put an arm around his shoulder in the brother way she had and told him to ask for help before he cried into his dough, and he told her he did not cry into dough, he cried into baguettes because it made the crust more honest. They ate bread off a knife and she sent him back out with a basket of pretzels for the crew and a promise to show him how to make the starter behave if it started acting like a teenager.\n\nOn a Tuesday when the work had been a hum and not a shout, Mrs. Kline cornered him on the stairs with an expression on her face that reminded him of the time she had accused the mailman of stealing her magazine, which had in fact fallen under her couch and been stuck there with a raisin. \u201cA man came,\u201d she said, flipping a hand like a page. \u201cHe asked if you live here. I said maybe. He left a packet with papers inside that are ridiculous because they say partnership and they mean contract and they mention a number that would make the cat faint.\u201d She held the envelope away from her as if it might be contagious. \u201cI hid it under your mat because if I put it inside you\u2019d know where it was and then you\u2019d do something you\u2019d have to hire me to forgive you for.\u201d\n\nHe took the envelope and felt the weight of it do a little dance with his stomach. He opened it at his table and read words that tried to turn him into trademark and then into product, words that asked whether he could remove the part of him that burned his fingertips and surrender it to a label. He ran a finger down the page and looked at the margin left by the printer and felt an old loyalty twitch. He set it aside because he had to, and he pulled out flour because flour did not negotiate. He made a cake he did not need because sometimes baking was a way of telling the room you will not leave.\n\nKitchens were loud when you were alone in them. The hood hummed, the mixer thumped its gallop, the oven gasped and softened into a good breath, the water at the three-bay sink slurred as it found drains that had not yet learned him. He wanted to call Dee and then did not, because he wanted the decision to be quiet until it had shape. He wanted to call Cassidy and ask how she had stayed human when cameras insisted on pinning her to a wall, and then he did not because he knew she would answer with a joke that would act like a stitch when he needed something less gentle. He did call Lena, and she answered with the sound of wind because she was driving and would not be told otherwise. He read her the numbers and she whistled and then told him to light the paper on fire as a ritual, the way their grandmother had burned her last husband\u2019s hat on a grill as a goodbye to something none of them could name. \u201cYou are allowed to be big,\u201d she said, and her voice was not a car anymore. \u201cYou are not required to be enormous. Enormous makes rooms grow teeth.\u201d\n\nHe told Dee after their second building of the night that he might be leaving the cart, and he watched her face the way men at the track watched the horse that had almost fallen last race. She nodded as if her head had been steadied by a kind hand. \u201cI knew before you did,\u201d she said, because she was not modest. \u201cOf course I did. You\u2019ve been looking at walls like they are asking you to hang shelves for other people. You can\u2019t leave badly. That\u2019s the only thing. You do not ghost a floor. You say goodbye to the cupboard and the mop sink and the poor plant that I have told so many truths to. You are allowed to cry in here where no one will make you into a GIF. But do not think I will let you walk out carrying all the boxes at once to prove something to someone who is not in the room.\u201d\n\nHe did not cry then, because he was greedy and wanted to save the good crying for a time when he could do it in a place with a lock. He nodded and wiped a nonexistent streak on the glass in front of them and put the rag back in the caddy in its spot because goodbyes are made of that kind of thing. He told the plant the news, because he had learned there were economies of ritual, and he heard Dee snort behind him and also sniff quietly. They went down to the lobby where the dawn put its confidence on and he looked at the sticker on the bin that said Team Queen City Clean and he smoothed the corners, which had lifted just enough to catch worry. He let his thumb press the edge back down and knew as soon as it held that he had done the thing he could do to make the moment presentable.\n\nOpening a place is a way of admitting that your private is willing to be borrowed. The first night the doors were not really doors yet; they were sheets of plastic that the contractor insisted would keep dust out and which in fact taught it how to enter in a more sophisticated fashion. The ovens came like medieval animals on dollies, ancient and dignified and easily insulted if handled badly. The first time they lit, the sound made him think of boats and lungs. Sammi had insisted on painting the front the color of old cream, which looked like nothing much until the sign went up and then looked like the correct decision your hands had been leading your mouth to all along. They hung a simple sign, which Lena praised and their mother called stingy, and Dee said, \u201cUnder-promise, over-deliver,\u201d while writing in Sharpie under the register, Do not run a tab for men who say they know my cousin.\n\nHe hired two people because two felt like a marriage and three a household. One was a girl from the school whose eyeliner now made statements rather than excuses; she showed up early and rearranged spoons like it was her religion. The other was a man who had moved to the city for a person and had been left by that person with a bed and a love of cinnamon and a need. The papers asked him if he would franchise and he said he would rather learn how not to burn toasted nuts on days when his mother had called, and then laughed until they were forced to print the laugh as a decision. He went to sleep at odd angles and at odd times, and if he dreamed, he did not always remember the narrative when he woke.\n\nOn the morning that was the day before opening, he woke to Pickles sitting on his chest in a perfect loaf, his bell a judgment and a mercy. The cat stared at his eyelids until they gave up. He could have sworn the cat knew; he could have sworn the animal had an opinion about hoods and permits and banners and men who wanted to put his rolls in airports. He scratched the stripe between the cat\u2019s eyes and suffered the slap of a tail and laughed even as the weight made his breathing personal. The street outside had already given itself to trucks and bread smells, and when he cracked the window he could hear someone down the block arguing with a pallet jack. He made coffee he would not drink, because the smell was more useful than the liquid right now, and he stood in the rectangle of the kitchen floor that seemed to love him best and set his plans down in a row. He had lists that said butter and lists that said exit routes and lists that reminded him to breathe when the first thing burned, because the first thing burned if only to remind everyone what heat could do.\n\nHe walked to the shop through the small regular noises of day starting up, the dog nails on sidewalk, the wheel hum, the woman who ran and performed a complicated negotiation with her hair tie and her desire to let the morning be messy. The alley behind the store smelled faintly of onions from the restaurant two over, and he made a mental note to learn that schedule because there were smells that fought and there were smells that danced, and onions would try to lead. He unlocked the door and breathed the industrial wood of prep tables that had not yet learned their stories. He set his hand flat on the new counter as if it were a fevered child. The crown on the refrigeration unit looked absurd, which was comforting. He turned on the oven and listened for the first cough that would announce that the day had started, and when it came it was not theatrical, it was small and ready, which he took as an omen better than birds.\n\nHe thought of Nana then, in a way that was less elegy and more instruction. He could almost hear her scold the oven for being too modern and drag the table closer to a window because light was free and had to be used. He could almost feel the weight of her palm between his shoulders, that steadying push that was also a challenge. He mixed dough and he told the room not to fuss, which made the room laugh in the way new rooms do when they are trying to please. When the first tray went in he closed the door as if he were putting a letter in a slot and learned, in that second again, that every oven is a person. He began frosting, the ermine glossy as an apology made at the right time, and he let the icing tell him when it was enough. He was not going to do a sugar crown the first day; he would not antagonize humidity until he and humidity had made a truce in front of this room\u2019s audience.\n\nSammi arrived with a box of single-stem flowers that had defied the gas station they came from. He set them into old ginger beer bottles with the concentration of a surgeon. \u201cWe look like we are pretending to be French, which is on brand for me and a sin in your grandmother\u2019s church,\u201d he said, fanning himself with the health department permit in a way that would make the inspector find him from miles away. Dee came with a mop because no matter how much you intend to begin in triumph, you begin in water. She told him not to sign anything placed in front of him by a person whose jacket cost more than his oven and then kissed his cheek with a briskness that dared the day to debate her. Lena appeared with a box of napkins she had stolen from a deli that would not miss them, and his mother slid in at the side door with a Tupperware of deviled eggs that she insisted had to be placed behind the register as emergency morale. Penelope sent a text that said, I\u2019m outside with bread because you will forget to eat inside your own place, and Cassidy sent a picture of a city skyline with a crown drawn in like a girl writing in a geometry book.\n\nAt ten fifty-nine they stood in a loose cluster that felt less like a staff and more like a family who has decided not to discuss who has the worst uncle. At eleven the door swung inward, and the bell\u2014not a cute one, a solid one that sounded like the word yes\u2014told the room it had changed. The first customer was the janitor from the school, who had come with his cart and an expression that made his eyebrows into bridges. He ordered one of everything and ten of the rolls and stood with his tray at the end of the counter because the generosity of choice had stunned him for a second. The second was the health inspector with the eyelashes and a date in a dress who rolled her eyes at him and told him not to make the man work today because he was not on shift. The third was the beekeeper without her hat, which was like seeing a church without its roof for a second and recognizing it anyway. The fourth was a woman who had never liked him and had nonetheless come to tell him she was proud, which he took as the prize in everything.\n\nThe room filled and then softened, the way bread does when it hits the right heat. There was a moment when the line was long enough for him to feel the corner of panic and he saw it and bowed to it and then looked past it the way you see the river and look up to the bridge because if you stare at the water too long you will begin to hear old stories tell themselves too loudly. He slid trays in and out with a rhythm he had studied for with his body. He spoke to the girl with the eyeliner with his eyes when he needed a plate and she got him the plate without the distorted theater of a cry. He burned the corners of one pan and fed that pan to the back door raccoon who had been holding his little hands together as if in prayer outside the alley and whose gratitude would be repaid by a knocked-over trash can on a night when they were tired. He cut slices of cake with a knife he warmed under hot water because a cold blade had\u2014today, at least\u2014decided to pull the crumb badly.\n\nThe first lull came at one-thirty and fell like a good seat. He wiped, because wiping was the thing you did when silence arrived even in a happy room. He looked at the crown and it did not look like a dare anymore. It looked like a detail in a picture you can point at later when someone who wasn\u2019t there demands proof. A shadow moved against the glass and a shape hopped into the window, tail a punctuation mark. Smee stared in with his critic\u2019s stare and made a small sound in his throat that meant either contempt or approval depending on your own need. Pickles, whose bell had preceded him like trumpets, sprang up onto the chair near the door with a spiral that would have impressed a choir director. The two cats stared at each other over the heads of men who did not notice and one woman who did and took a photograph without thinking whether the internet needed it. Smee flicked an ear; Pickles flicked his entire posterior; the truce held because both were in the habit of being allowed to have opinions and neither wished to knock a plate off a table when honey was within smacking distance.\n\nWhen he finally let himself sit, it was on a milk crate behind the counter and for a time that could be measured by a door swing and a breath. He felt the tired come into his bones as a friend, the kind that takes your shoes off without asking and does not try to talk. He heard the river from here even though he could not hear the river from here, the way you hear a clock that is not in the room because your wrist remembers. The girl with the eyeliner slid him a plate with a deviled egg because she had learned fast and because she liked to watch him wince at the way their mother used too much paprika. Sammi waved a towel like a flag at a fly that had been trying to upstage the tart. Dee reached under the counter and held his hand for half a breath because she was a person who was not ashamed of touching when touching steadied the world.\n\nIt would be a long afternoon and a longer week. It would be a series of mornings that began at quiet and turned into the particular clatter of knives talking to plates and names talking to mouths. It would be checks and signatures and a scrape from a pan he would feel in his thumb for days. It would be the slow amendment of himself to the room, of the room to himself. It would be men with clipboards forgiven and men with clipboards not invited back. It would be Mrs. Kline coming in to stand at the door and say, loudly enough for the raccoon to learn manners, \u201cWell, will you look at that, a place that will fail if you don\u2019t give that custard to people who look like me. Hand over the secret,\u201d followed by the utter silence of him refusing except with a fork and plate. It would be seeing his mother at a table with a woman he did not know without fear, just curiosity that would be allowed to be answered in the slow way. It would be learning which corner of the counter was where sad news tended to be delivered and which corner made people tell the truth about their feet. It would be a hundred little answers to the question of how to be a person whose hands made something that vanished only to be asked for again, which is what love looks like if you put it on a schedule.\n\nNear closing, as the last summer light tilted itself into the windows and made the sugar on the tart glow in a way that was a cheap effect and also perfect, he stepped outside with a last tray of rolls for the crew that had assembled around this room the way bees assemble around a story. The air moved on his face like an apology for something it had not done. Across the street the blue tile wall on Vine took the evening and handed it back brighter. A bus rolled by with a poster for a show he had not agreed to be on yet, and the driver gave him a little salute like a fellow worker and he returned it like a man who knew which way his cap faced. He could smell the river the way you smell a kitchen when you round the corner of home. He tucked his chin, smiled because he hadn\u2019t earned not to, and went back inside to take one more pan from the oven before it decided to remind him that heat had two hands.",

Fridays strutted, Mondays sulked, Wednesdays cracked in the middle like bread that forgot its steam, but Tuesdays held their spine and didn\u2019t ask for applause. He told Dee a week ahead and she did not tell him she had known since the night his face had started looking past the corners of rooms to the places where ovens might go. She simply wrote his shift in black pen and then drew a small crown next to his name as if a child had borrowed her hand for a second. He felt the knowledge in his knuckles every time he wrung the mop, the way grief lives in the same bone as weather.\n\nThe building accepted the ritual because buildings are religious creatures if you treat them long enough like sanctuaries. They started at the top, because they always started at the top, and rode the elevator with the polite boredom of people who had memorized the coughs of its cables. The key ring on his belt felt heavier, not with metal, but with the anticipation of removal. Dee moved quick and then not, the way she always did when she was making a point to a clock. When they hit the eleventh floor she pressed her palm to the wall outside the conference room as if checking it for fever and said, \u201cYou tell the wall thank you,\u201d like he was slow. \u201cDon\u2019t make me raise you wrong at the end.\u201d\n\nThey worked for forty minutes without commentary, because some gratitude only counts if you don\u2019t say it over the work. He wiped the handprints off the glass partitions with a motion he had taught a hundred times to people who preferred circles and streaks; he ran the vacuum in the straight lanes that had satisfied him when other things refused to. He found the office plant that had spoken all their secrets back to them and touched its pot like a shoulder. Dee stood behind him with her hip jutted and her head cocked and said, \u201cNow you\u2019ve made it weird,\u201d and then she put two fingers on one yellowing leaf and stroked it with a tenderness she saved for machine parts and living things she did not intend to admit she needed.\n\nAt three, because habit is ceremony, they stood at the north windows and looked out. The river had laid itself flat to appease the thunderheads should they arrive. Covington had let five people turn on kitchen lightbulbs in the last ten minutes; the pattern was nothing and also fate. A barge slid under the Roebling with the long patience of a family story. He could see, faint white at the curve of the sky above Newport, the flare of heat lightning that announced summer\u2019s temper. He told himself, and he told the glass, and he told the woman beside him without saying it out loud, that a person could love two things in a way that didn\u2019t ask either to shrink. He had loved these halls. He had loved these corners that had learned his shoulder. He would love a room with flour in its cracks. He would love them both until the part in him that could not be split objected.\n\nThey did the last bathroom like priests with a relic. Dee made him re-do two sinks he had done with nerves instead of attention and he did not sigh. When they had hung the mops to drip and leaned the brooms in their assigned angles and refilled the paper towel caddies with the muscle memory of monks binding books, he took his keys off his belt. He set them on the shelf in the supply closet where the dust made everyone honest. He put his thumb on the Team Queen City Clean sticker to smooth its unruly corner and it stayed; he felt that small success like a blessing. Dee stood with her hands in her back pockets, which made her look like a foreman and a mother, and looked everywhere but at his hands.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll come back to walk the hall with me when the building forgets how good it can look,\u201d she said, and it wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cYou\u2019ll call me if anyone talks to you like a magazine and I will put on shoes and go to their office and water their plant with their coffee. Don\u2019t get soft. Don\u2019t get mean. Those are the only rules I care about. And don\u2019t let anyone tell you clean floors don\u2019t matter because their shoes are expensive.\u201d\n\nHe said okay to all of it. He said okay to the things she hadn\u2019t named, the stranded rituals, the jokes that only worked at four-thirty when the elevator made its haunted sound. They hugged because they were not showy people and because sometimes you hug to keep your chest from coming apart in a dry way. In the manager\u2019s office, whose little waterfall still muttered managerial wisdom to no one, he signed the form that made it official and shook hands with a man who called him valued and mispronounced his last name in a way that would have been charming from a grandmother and was not from a manager. Dee took his keys and slipped them onto her belt with a motion that honored the weight. \u201cI\u2019ll hold them until your hand stops reaching for your hip when you leave rooms,\u201d she said, and they both laughed and both coughed and then both laughed again because it had been a long time since coughing wasn\u2019t scary.\n\nThe bakery met him with flour talk. He stepped through the door and felt the air greet him the way a dog recognizes one body\u2019s footstep from the thousand that pass. The ovens had learned his moods and, in their grumbling way, approved of big ones because it gave them something to do. The girl with the eyeliner had written a quote on the prep board from the big-handed baker about not letting anyone put their voice in your wrist and added, in a different color, a heart she pretended didn\u2019t belong to her. The man who made cinnamon smell like a decision had stacked trays with the hushed efficiency of a person who had been told once that he made too much noise in the kitchen and had saved the critique for a rainy day.\n\nHe could feel the storm in the way sugar poured. It clumped just slightly, reluctant to leave itself for air. Outside, the sky was a bruise with a soft middle. The beekeeper arrived with a hat that could have blocked artillery and news that arrived in the same tone she used for recipes and death. \u201cMites,\u201d she said, and let the word walk around the room, stepping on flour with military boots. \u201cI lost a third this week. I\u2019m not crying because I have reached the stage of grief where rage makes itself useful. Will you take a box on your roof.\u201d She held up her chin the way people do when they don\u2019t want to be told no because the word might break something internal they do not have parts to replace just now.\n\nHe thought of permits and health inspectors with eyelashes and a landlord\u2019s granddaughter who saw the city like a ledger and also like a novel. He thought of honey moving through a kitchen as if sweetness were a public utility. He thought of his grandmother calling bees ladies and blessing them when they bumped into her ear. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, because sometimes the mouth had to outrun the brain if you wanted to behave like the person you intended to become. \u201cWe\u2019ll make friends with the landlord\u2019s father by pretending it was his idea. I\u2019ll bring him a roll and a napkin and ask whether he remembers what bees tasted like when he was small. If he says no, I\u2019ll say yes for him and he\u2019ll agree because nostalgia is the cheapest spice.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore the storm works its way into the part of their bodies that make decisions. We\u2019ll start them small. You\u2019ll hear them from your bed if you leave the window open. That\u2019s not a warning. That\u2019s a lullaby. Also, the candles.\u201d She opened her bag like a magician with practical training and set two rows of beeswax cylinders on the counter, pouring the light out in another form. \u201cTake them. The electricity will do that thing men do\u2014a disappearing act and an apology only half meant. Burn these and pretend you planned romance.\u201d\n\nHe did the prep with the attention he had learned to replace panic. He weighed flour the way you weigh choices when you are trying to love one person without leaving another. Honey loosened on the stove and smelled like other people\u2019s breakfasts. He had three doughs going because the city had been coming for the midnight buns with a hunger that was less novelty and more recognition. Sammi arrived with the storm in his hair and a camping stove he swore would not kill anyone. \u201cMy father says he used this in 1978 to make scrapple when the whole neighborhood lost its mind,\u201d he announced, setting it up on a stainless-steel table with the adoration men save for machines that saved them once. \u201cWe\u2019ll make coffee on it when the lights go and call it heritage.\u201d\n\nAt six the day went gray and humid, the sort of air that sat on your chest and asked rude questions. The first thunder rolled like barrels. People came in anyway because sugar is a thing people make a pact with and storms do not interrupt ceremonies, they accompany. The girl with the eyeliner took orders with the ability to watch two things and smile at a third. He saw the janitor from the school in line with a teenager in a hoodie who looked at the room like it owed him money and then, when he bit into the roll, like he was owed nothing and had been handed a gift anyway. Penelope stuck her face in the back door like a weather report and yelled over the hood\u2019s hum, \u201cMy oven\u2019s got gas and a stubborn streak; you lose your lights, bring dough to me,\u201d and then she left because bread waited for no pronouncement.\n\nThe storm arrived like anger finally deciding to be useful. Rain hit the windows flat, urgent, as if someone had put their hands to the glass and clapped. The bell on the door sounded busy and brave, because the people of his city knew how to time their runs between the drops. The first flicker from the bulbs made the room hold its breath and then pretend it hadn\u2019t. The second took the sound down a notch but left the ovens frowning and the mixer muttering. The third turned everything to a soft-dark that was somehow theatrical and also, immediately, practical.\n\nDee was up from the basement level of her other life in one minute and thirty seconds because she had smelled it from blocks away. She carried a battery lantern under one arm and a roll of gaffer tape in her teeth like a pirate and set both down with a thunk that said protocol. \u201cSoft systems first,\u201d she announced to the room like a drill sergeant who had retired from a kinder army but kept the hat. \u201cBackups for hands. Touch your knees before you trip. Nobody lights anything with a panic. You, eyebrows,\u201d she said to Sammi, \u201cmake your grandfather proud with that stove but keep it away from paper that hasn\u2019t decided its career path.\u201d\n\nThe beekeeper lit the beeswax and the room softened in a way no salon had accomplished, the light honey-gentle and stubborn. People went quieter, not because they\u2019d been told to, but because the room had changed the scale of its voice and asked for a different kind of listening. Outside, lightning blew a white hole in the sky and stitched it closed again. The ovens sat, their pilot lights alive, their brains confused. He knew this feeling in people. He reached for the manual override because his hands preferred levers to buttons when things got real. The first flame caught with a cough. The second refused to be told and then flirted and came. He had never loved an inanimate object the way he loved a well-behaved gas line in a storm.\n\nThey made rolls by feel. He could not see the dough\u2019s exact shine but he had spent so many hours touching it into place that his hands recognized the right wet as surely as he recognized Lena\u2019s laugh in a bar. He balanced pans on racks that seemed to lean toward him with interest. He sent the eyeliner girl out with small plates and a command whenever the door opened and the storm shoved, because a plate in a hand could be a promise you kept for a stranger. Sammi poured coffee that tasted like history. The beekeeper moved among people with a tray of candles she had clearly carried for scenarios like this, setting light on tables with the authority of a woman who had convinced insects to stay put.\n\nAt some point, because fate is a writer without a sense of when to leave a scene alone, Smee appeared on the sill, his coat soaked to a darker brick, his collar bell ringing its complaint. He looked in at the light and at the plates and at the people and at Rory with the slow, shredding contempt only cats and certain kinds of art critics manage, then hopped down and pawed at the door until the eyeliner girl opened it with a sigh of a queen. He stepped inside and shook himself with the drama of a dog and then remembered himself and pretended he had meant to do that with poise. Pickles arrived three minutes later because cats text each other with a radio humans can\u2019t hear. The two animals looked at one another in a way that would have caused a duel if they were men, then found separate high surfaces and pretended to have been raised to better standards. Somewhere at a corner table a woman took their picture and then put her phone away and watched the rain instead, which was a turn in the plot he approved of.\n\nHe gave away what would not keep. He told the room the truth: that sugar dislikes being asked to wait beyond reason, that some foods are only themselves in a very narrow window you can miss by being decent and cautious. People paid anyway, because the city liked to make that kind of math come out. During one roll of thunder that made the windows tray-rattle, he looked up and saw, at the hinge of two candles near the door, his mother and a woman he did not know. The woman was small and wore a cardigan that had lost a button in a place that would have embarrassed a person with a different relationship to embarrassment. They shared a plate and they rested their forearms on the table like sisters who had survived each other and were practicing being tender. He could feel himself gasp without sound. His mother looked at him only once, and in that glance said, Not now, I am busy learning, which was a sentence he had not thought she possessed.\n\nPenelope walked in with a plastic crate that had seen floods and weddings. \u201cOther ovens,\u201d she announced, plunking the crate on the prep table, \u201chot and ready to insult you if you call them cute. You are not allowed to have a hero narrative if I am present. We bake as a species or not at all.\u201d She shook rain out of her hair like a saint with a sense of humor and took pans as if they were babies. He wanted to kiss her forehead and contented himself with making her tea on the camping stove because the line between gratitude and worship had to be preserved for days without lightning.\n\nAn hour in the room had a rhythm, the way blackouts do when people decide they would rather be kind than frantic. The janitor supervised a spontaneous project to prop the door at intervals to let in air and not rain because you can solve physics with teamwork if the hallway smells like cinnamon. The girl with the eyeliner took a woman by the elbow so she would not stomp a child underfoot and then released her before the woman noticed she had been shepherded. Dee stood in the corner where the floor sloped, where accidents liked to be born, and watched for them, her hand on her hip, the other on the battery lantern as if ready to shine down on trouble like a god the size of a auntie. Cassidy appeared at some point with an umbrella that had given up and hair like a plot twist, slid behind the counter unasked, and took a bag of trash out as if she had been born there. \u201cThis is my idea of heaven,\u201d she told him when she passed. \u201cControlled chaos and sugar. Do not be humble when the lights come back. Let people think you planned this. I will slander you on television if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen the streetlamps blinked awake and the room made that small, guilty sound spaces make when electricity forgives them, the candles burned on. No one clapped because there was nothing to applaud; it felt as if the scene had reached a natural end and someone had tugged the curtain because they were cold. He let the ovens go back to their newer habits with a pat on the side a man would be mocked for if seen elsewhere. They finished the last tray and sent the last plate out because stopping mid-bake is an affront to the gods of small consistency. When the door closed on the last customer who had stood for five minutes at the threshold to push his wet hair off his forehead and decide whether to step into light or storm, he turned and leaned his shoulder against the cool of the walk-in and let himself laugh. It sounded like what a person might mistake for crying at a distance, and he did not mind if someone did.\n\nThey cleaned slower, the way you clean when the room has told you stories and needs silence to keep them. The beeswax candles made the floor look forgiving. The cats had both vanished, because mystery requires punctuation and they were professionals. The beekeeper collected the stubs and hummed under her breath in a way that made the hairs on his forearms stand, as if the room recognized the song even if his ear did not. Sammi wiped down a counter like a man who had been given a second childhood with a rag. Dee sat on a milk crate and rolled her ankle and pronounced it fit for another five decades, then stood and kissed the top of his head because she was, on rare occasions, a person who allowed herself to be sentimental for the span of one breath.\n\nWhen the buckets were empty and the racks lined with a single clean towel to feel less alone and the register counted down to a number that would pay the light bill and the indignity bill and leave enough for flour, he and the beekeeper climbed to the roof. The storm had moved on but left its laundry on the line. The city steamed in patches. The river carried a branch the size of a confession and a small army of bottles that would never get to tell their story. They set the little hive box near the back corner where brick met sky. The beekeeper breathed like a woman who had taught lungs to find patience. He felt something in his chest answer that lesson with gratitude. The bees would wake and learn the map and tell one another where the flowers were; the roof would become a sentence in their dance.\n\nHe slept that night as if his body had finally accepted the terms of the job. He woke once to the distinct thrum through the open window that meant life and was not loud about it. He slept again.\n\nIn the morning the river had changed color the way it does after a night of conversation, brown lifted into a green that wasn\u2019t a feeling you could put words to. He went to the bridge and leaned his forearms on the railing and watched the little islands of debris cruise to a rendezvous they had not planned. A man a few feet away flicked a cigarette into the wind and then looked sorry because the water was in a mood that made even litterers patient. Rory thought of ice shards and sugar and the night before and of the way things hold form when they want to and don\u2019t when they need to change. He let the whole of it pass through the narrow part in him where worry likes to sit. It moved on.\n\nBack at the shop, the electrician had left a note wedged in the door in handwriting that made you forgive his rates. He had circled a breaker box on a little map and written Look here first like a love letter in a language you\u2019d learned in high school and were now teaching yourself again. The landlord\u2019s granddaughter stood on the sidewalk with coffee and a smile that said she had fought a small war with her father and both of them had won. \u201cBees,\u201d she said, with no sarcasm and a little dread. \u201cIf they sting him he will have to learn not to take it personally. He is the kind of man who thinks yellow jackets are after his character. I told him if he wanted to ban them he could go out there and tell them himself. He\u2019s not fond of ladders. We\u2019re a go until somebody with a clipboard says we aren\u2019t. Then we\u2019ll hide the box by putting a sign in front of it that says Electrical. No one ever looks behind those.\u201d\n\nHe shook her hand and it felt like the cement after a sidewalk gets fixed, that moment when it holds and still remembers being liquid. He tied a little ribbon of caution tape on the ladder so the clumsy would be warned and thought of Nana, who would have called the bees \u201cthe girls\u201d and baked them something sugary and unnecessary. At eleven, the first customer was the man who runs the ice machine at the dive bar on his block, who said, \u201cHeard you kept it open in the dark,\u201d as if he were giving a medal to a person for standing still in rain. At noon, the girl with the eyeliner stapled a flyer for a mentorship night to the bulletin board and looked away like she didn\u2019t want to see it become real. At one, Penelope dropped a bag of flour labeled in permanent marker with obscene pet names because bakers are sentimental in that weird way. At two, his mother came in with a teenage boy Rory had never seen and said, \u201cThis is who I was before I knew you,\u201d without any drama, just the temperature of a truth laid on a table.\n\nHe learned her name old again, because some days words need exhuming and polish. He made them both lemon something that the boy said was indoor sunlight. The boy had his mother\u2019s jaw and another person\u2019s impatience. He sat awkward and alert as if deciding on an opinion about this room and the man in it that he would be stuck with for the next ten years. The mothers of cities carry these decisions in their purses and their bones. Rory took a breath that felt like a long hallway and said hello to the boy in a tone he would take to churches if he ever went, and the boy said hello back in a tone that he would deploy in cafeterias until he learned not to waste it on people who didn\u2019t deserve his careful.\n\nHe had to cut himself loose from the counter to meet a man with a ladder and an invoice for the hood and he wanted to stay at the table where his mother\u2019s hands were folded and her knuckles looked like they did when she was twenty-five and knocked on the neighbor\u2019s door to complain about the music. He had to trust that some scenes could be re-entered after you signed the line under a number. Dee caught his eye across the room and did the thing she did when he was choosing between being present and being needed. She tipped her chin toward his mother with the imperceptible motion of a woman who had orchestrated a triage in a storm and a bake sale in a snow. He nodded and let his hands do the moving, the head do the nodding, the body do the several contradictory things bodies do when you are in charge of flour and feelings.\n\nThe letter from the station where he used to ride the elevator and recoil at his reflection came two days later. It was from the HR person whose name had probably been memed in a Slack channel for her insistence on phrases like \u201coffboarding\u201d and \u201clegacy task integration.\u201d It said his last paycheck would be short two hours because someone could not read a clock or had chosen not to, and it said there would be cake at a gathering he would not attend, and it said all the right things in the wrong order. He set it on the counter and wrote himself a little invoice for the missing hours in pencil on the back of a flour receipt and then placed it inside Nana\u2019s recipe book because that kept the math from feeling like money and more like weather.\n\nIt would have been enough to take those hours back with stubbornness and a phone call. It would have been fine to let them go like pennies into a jar you never empty. Instead, he sent a plate and a note with a kid who had learned the elevator\u2019s grudges, the note addressed to the plant. It said, \u201cI left you three song titles worth of secrets. Please tell them only to the next person who empties the bucket.\u201d He put the missing hours into a tip pool for his new people because it seemed like a spell your grandmother writes on a scrap and says aloud while you\u2019re peeling potatoes.\n\nThe blackout became a story the city told itself generously for three days. He had to bat it away with careful hands when men with microphones tried to make it into a fable about bootstraps because he had been held up by an entire parade during a storm. He took a call from a man whose voice had the Indiana he had not wanted in it, and he did not know, until he knew, that it was his father. The man said his name twice, as if calling a dog that might remember even after a long winter in which names were not used and only whistles were allowed. \u201cSaw your face,\u201d his father said, and the quality of that seeing was a dozen kinds of wrong and three kinds of right. \u201cI\u2019d like a roll.\u201d He could hear the background, could hear a television that had been left on for company and air buzzing and a refrigerator that had not been cleaned in a decade but kept trying.\n\nRory felt his stomach step out of the room for a second and have a smoke. He watched his right hand lay itself palm-down on the counter without instruction as if to remind the rest of him where he was and what he could steady. He thought he would say no in a crisp-clean way and then he did not, because there were mothers in city light making peace at tables and there were boys leaning on napkins with new thoughts in their elbows. \u201cSunday,\u201d he said, hearing the word land in front of him like a thing to step over. \u201cEleven. There will be people. You can stand with them or not. If not, I will hand you a paper bag and you can leave it unopened on your seat until you change your mind.\u201d He heard the man on the other end shift a breath. He said something that wasn\u2019t sorry and might have been its cousin, then did the decent thing and hung up before either of them tried to improve the moment and smudged it.\n\nThe roof bees settled with the nonchalance of successful colonizers. He learned the hum of them the way you learn the creaks of an old house, which stair to step on wrong with a friend so you both fall down laughing and which to avoid when the person asleep in the next room deserves world peace. The beekeeper texted him pictures of pollen saddlebags that made him want to purchase a microscope and forgive his sixth-grade science teacher. He smudged his first sting like a blessing on his wrist and did not mind the pulse of it for an hour. He put a sign under the crown that said the honey used in this room comes from ladies in your sky and watched people\u2019s faces soften in the way of people who have been allowed to consider their air alive.\n\nHe gave a talk at the library because a woman with a nametag and a fierceness of glasses asked him, and people sat in the lower-level room with the carpet that smelled like old glue and spilled childhood and listened to him tell them the fewer words version of the whole long thing. He saw three men from the late shift sit in the back near the outlet because there was a phone to charge. He saw a woman who had played viola in the Music Hall orchestra even though it had never paid properly and who now taught children to use their arms like wings. He saw the janitor in a clean shirt with his grandchild who wore everything like armor. He was asked, very carefully by a man whose nose had been broken once and set by a person who did not possess art, whether he had forgiven anyone. He answered with butter. It was the only way he knew to make honesty edible in public.\n\nOn a Wednesday when the river wore its green-brown good suit and the city held its humidity like a grudge, he put up a hand-lettered notice on the bulletin board next to the flyers for jazz and dog sitting and rooms above bars. It said Custodians Eat Free on Tuesdays and Do Not Tell Me Otherwise. He had meant it as a joke with blood in it. He had meant it as a small tithe to a god he had served. A week later a woman in a shirt with bleach ghosts came in and tried to pay anyway and he refused twice and took a dollar for the staff tip jar the third time because dignity does in fact enjoy tipping. She sat with her back straight and her face relaxed and ate slowly and took a second to swipe the crumbs into a little pile with her palm so she could carry them in her mouth and not on her shirt back to a hallway with a schedule on a clipboard.\n\nThere were nights in that stretch where he forgot how to speak in sentences not made of nouns, where he handed the tray and lifted the towel and knocked the oven door with his knee to remind it who was in charge. There were hours when the river and the road and the alley and the bees and the cat bells and the cheap seats and the crown and the smell of black walnuts tangled in a way that could only be combed with sleep. On those mornings he stood with his hands in dishwater and let plates become circles again. He smoothed the sticker on the new bin that said Team Night Custard Clean and felt the corner hold. The city made its own weather, in storms and in rooms, and he had decided to stand where he could taste it and let it ruin him and wake him and then feed him toast with honey until he could stand again. He had learned to tie his shoes tighter when the floor was wet. He had learned to light an oven by hand when it argued. He had learned that good news, if you held it, had weight after all. He had learned that the lamp over his sink would turn his hands a color that made him want to keep them. He put them back in the dough, and the day, which was a kind one or pretending to be, lifted its chin and let him.",
