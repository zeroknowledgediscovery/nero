     "novel_text": "Rill of Poole had learned to read the tides like a locksmith learns the mouths of keys. He stood on a creaking plank under the old Twin Sails bridge, where the cables hummed faintly, where barnacles made hieroglyphs of the pilings. The evening had turned the harbour to pewter. The swell lifted the eelgrass in the shallows, and each glimmer on the water was a small, quick heartbeat. Rill felt them against his calves, the pulse and pull; he could count time on his ankles. He was a sprite, which meant he was not much taller than a good-luck charm, made of salt and nettle and chance, but he weighed more than you\u2019d think when he chose to.\n\nHe had a number of skills, a particular set that was not common even in Poole\u2019s hidden corners: he could untie the unsaid from a knot; he could hear a map sing of its edges; he could reach into a bottle for the last word after the last word was gone. He\u2019d learned those things from water and rope and the patient persistence of gulls that never quit. He used them now, standing on the lip of a rusty chain-link drain, his toes gripping a loop of it like a sparrow\u2019s claws, eyes closed. The lost phrase was caught somewhere near, tangled in the green cords and the hair-thin threads of spider-silk that had caught the dust of many summers.\n\n\u201cStop dithering,\u201d Kettle said from behind him. Her voice was soft because everything about Kettle was soft: her hair like moss, her hands like mittens. She kept a folding brazier on her back and made the best oysters-with-pepper of any sprite in the southern harbours. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting, Rill.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can wait,\u201d Rill said without opening his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s waited for four days; he can wait for three breaths more. The word slid down the drain mouth, and it\u2019s hiding in a knot of slime. If I yank, I\u2019ll lose the tail of it.\u201d\n\nKettle clacked the brazier lightly as if offended on behalf of the man above them. \u201cI know you have\u2026 skills.\u201d She had a way of saying the word as if it\u2019d been borrowed and might need to be returned with a bow. \u201cBut the Harbour Patrol\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look down,\u201d Rill said. He reached into the drain with his left hand, not his right, because the right was good for knots but the left was good for lies, and the last word of a dying man to his battered boat was a bit of both. He felt the cold-slick of the metal rim, the furry damp, the notch on his index finger where a mussel had once bitten him. Then he made a hook of his thumb and fished with it, found a snag, and teased.\n\nThe phrase came up as a thin ribbon, translucent, splashed with bits of grit. He had it in his palm. It tried to flutter away, to get back to the drain\u2019s silted inner. He cupped it with a wind that didn\u2019t exist and whispered the bottle\u2019s name in its ear, then fed it into the brown glass waiting by his ankle. The bottle had been rubbed with fish scales to quiet it and lined with a spider\u2019s exhale to keep it supple.\n\n\u201cSay it then,\u201d Kettle urged, curious. She always was curious about gleanings, about the small salvage that kept them fed and favoured.\n\nRill shook his head. \u201cThose are only for the one that said them or the one that needs them. We just wrangle.\u201d\n\nAbove them, on the bridge\u2019s walkway, a fisherman with eyes as red as the sun\u2019s last sting leaned on the rail. Kettle took the bottle, scrambled up a ladder that only sprites could grip, and pressed it into the man\u2019s big human hand. He cried then; Rill could hear the salt change in the air.\n\nHe let the plank hold him a breath longer and then turned, flipping upside down to mark the underside of the bridge with a small seam of blue clay. It was his way of saying, \u201cDone.\u201d It was a habit. It was also a ward. There were so many wishes tossed down to the water; the water needed help cataloguing.\n\n\u201cThree more of those tomorrow,\u201d Kettle said as Rill came up to join her on the walkway. She nodded toward the quay lights, toward the ferries at their berths, toward the gulls that had learned the timetables. \u201cGreen George says there\u2019s a red thread around your name; says the Assembly will want your ear. Ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cThreads don\u2019t belong around names.\u201d Rill straightened, flexed his shoulder. He was wiry and quick and had hands like he\u2019d been born from the pockets of a thief, which in a way wasn\u2019t wrong. He looked past Kettle to the crescent of the harbour, to Brownsea\u2019s dark hulk on the horizon, to the lighthouse that winked steady as a heartbeat. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not wrong, wrong. It\u2019s\u2026 something,\u201d Kettle said. \u201cA disturbance. Someone\u2019s turned the benches in the Old Copse upside down and left goose-feathers jammed in the wattle. And there are dead nettles, Rill.\u201d She shivered. \u201cDead nettles, in August. Who does that?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn idiot,\u201d Rill said lightly. But his neck hairs bristled. Dead nettles were as pointed as exclamation marks, and sprites didn\u2019t like punctuation much. Punctuation meant decisions.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2026 telling jokes,\u201d Kettle said as if the words had grit in them. \u201cAn inappropriate sprite.\u201d\n\nRill thought of the last time he\u2019d heard the name. Grin. He turned it in his mouth as if it were a stick he could taste the fire from, testing the burn. \u201cHe\u2019s back in Poole?\u201d\n\nKettle rolled her eyes skyward. \u201cHe never left, if you ask me. He just hides between syllables. He was in the cress beds last week, telling bad jokes to the crabs. Made them pinch their own legs. Nix says a boy broke his arm falling off the quay because of a quip about wings. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be funny,\u2019 he said, then it was.\u201d\n\nRill rubbed his knuckle against his lip, a habit when he was thinking. Grin told jokes that were wrong in the particular way that made water roll back from your ankles. They weren\u2019t filthy, not in that way, not exactly, but they were like saying \u201cfire\u201d in a quiet library or \u201cquiet\u201d in a burning room. Inappropriate was the word for them, except that made them sound small. They were levers. And Grin liked to pry.\n\n\u201cWho told him he was funny,\u201d Rill murmured.\n\n\u201cEveryone,\u201d Kettle said, and the word had a certain bitterness). \u201cEveryone laughs. They can\u2019t help it. He makes it so the laugh comes first and the sense comes later, and by the time the sense arrives, the joke\u2019s already lodged like a fishbone.\u201d\n\nRill looked at his left palm, where there was still a faint shimmer from the word he\u2019d caught. He flexed his fingers. \u201cAnd the Assembly wants me because\u2014?\u201d\n\nKettle made a see-saw with her hand. \u201cYour\u2026 capabilities. The way knots behave when you talk to them. The way you can find the end of a thing even when it\u2019s been chewed off.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d Rill turned down the quay. \u201cBut first I want to\u2026 I want to see the Old Copse.\u201d\n\nThey ghosted along the fringe of the quay where the shadows were thickest and the voices from the pubs were like a chorus of tailors tearing cloth. Rill kept his eyes on the ground, listening for nails in the wood, for the tired crack of a rail that had been leaned on too much by grief or joy. He used those small noises to memorize. Kettle kept pace, her brazier clinking. Somewhere a foghorn sighed as if the night had stepped on a cat.\n\nThe Old Copse was a wedge of trees that had grown up in the lee of the embankment where the railway once slept. Sprites liked it because the roots made rooms, because the ivy was a good listener. Rill slipped into the green hush and found the benches upside down just as Kettle had said. The goose-feathers were jammed in the wattle fence at odd angles, like halfway thoughts. Where the nettles should have been he found pale stalks, bleached and curled, wearing their deaths openly.\n\nAnd someone had carved a mouth into the bark of the grandmother oak. It wasn\u2019t a mouth, exactly, more like a notch that resembled one, but if you stood at a certain angle and squinted, it was a grin. Below it, someone had written: \u201cWhy do islands never get lost? Because they\u2019re never better at sea.\u201d\n\nKettle snorted despite herself. Then she clamped both hands over her mouth and stamped her foot. \u201cNo. No. That\u2019s rotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad joke. That\u2019s the point,\u201d Rill said. \u201cHe\u2019s staking claims.\u201d He stepped closer to the oak and put his hand on the grin to feel if any heat lived in the cut. It was cold; the cold of something that wanted to be warmer.\n\nA flicker in the underbrush. Rill stilled. Kettle stilled. The flicker became a shape: long-ish, slended as a reed, hair like a shock of milkweed fluff, grin too wide for his small face. He came out into the moonlight and bowed in an exaggerated billow as if he\u2019d been on stage and the applause had just stopped.\n\n\u201cHello Poole,\u201d he said to the air, to the ground, to the tree, to Rill only at the last. \u201cDon\u2019t step on anyone\u2019s shadow. They\u2019re fragile this season.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrin,\u201d Kettle said flat. \u201cWe were just\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAdmiring my horticulture,\u201d Grin finished, waggling his eyebrows. \u201cOr, as I like to call it, horti-cackle-ture.\u201d He let the words hang and watched their shadows as if they were birds. \u201cYou like the dead nettles? It\u2019s a joke. See? Dead nettles are not dead. But they are called dead. So if I make them dead-dead, are they\u2026 more alive? No? All right. Tough crowd.\u201d\n\nRill kept his palm on the tree. He wanted to keep the bark between them as long as he could. Grin\u2019s smile wasn\u2019t always a weapon. Sometimes it was just a smile. But he used it to mark territory, and territory, in a place like Poole, meant old promises.\n\n\u201cLet the nettles be nettles,\u201d Rill said, no heat in his tone. \u201cThe Assembly won\u2019t like your\u2026 experiments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Assembly,\u201d Grin said, mouthing the syllables like fruit he\u2019d been given as a child. \u201cSo many elders packed into one word you\u2019d think it would burst, wouldn\u2019t you? But no. It hangs together anyway. Fascinating. Like a knot. Like your head.\u201d He pointed at Rill\u2019s temple as if aiming a stick there. \u201cYou tie things up and then you say you\u2019re freeing them. And everyone claps, clap-clap. Is that a skill or just habit?\u201d\n\nRill took his hand off the tree and put them both in his pockets for lack of anything better to do with them. He watched Grin\u2019s eyes. They were bright with the lights of the harbour and something else. \u201cYou went to school in mischief and graduated in hazard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s almost poetry. Careful.\u201d Grin stepped closer until he was at the edge of Kettle\u2019s brazier\u2019s glow. \u201cAll right then. Let\u2019s stop pretending I\u2019m not here for a reason. I\u2019m here for a reason. There\u2019s a crack in the world the size of a string, and I\u2019d like to fit a joke through it. Maybe two if I\u2019m feeling bold. You know how doors work; I know how rooms sound when you shout.\u201d\n\nKettle made a small noise in her throat and bit her lip until it went pale. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n\nRill said nothing. He watched a woodlouse amble over a stone by Grin\u2019s shoe, watched it decide the shade was better and turn back. He wondered what a crack in the world would feel like in his hands. Like a fish he couldn\u2019t quite bring up? Like the last word he\u2019d caught today? Eventually he said, \u201cJokes are not bridges.\u201d\n\nGrin laughed. It sounded, trivial, almost, but the ivy rustled when it shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cAren\u2019t they?\u201d he said. \u201cJoke: two shores, a sentence, a leap. We laugh in the air. You land, if you\u2019re lucky. If not, well. Splash.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease go away,\u201d Kettle said, and it wasn\u2019t a pleading sort of plea; it was a making-room-with-her-breath kind. She was one of the few who could look at a dangerous thing and not blink.\n\nGrin made a face as if he\u2019d tasted a lemon. \u201cSuch hospitality. I\u2019ll go then. Not because I was told. But because I have places to be and people to disappoint.\u201d He pivoted on his heel. \u201cRill of Poole,\u201d he said over his shoulder, \u201cyou have\u2026 useful fingers. Sometime soon I will ask you to pick a lock for me. You will say no. And then you will say yes. It\u2019ll be hilarious. Horribly.\u201d\n\nThen he slid into the ivy and was gone, as if he\u2019d made a mouth in the leaves to swallow himself.\n\nKettle exhaled into her hands. Rill looked at the notch he\u2019d carved in the underside of the bridge earlier today in his mind and wished it were here for him to mark. \u201cHe\u2019s worse,\u201d Kettle said. \u201cHe\u2019s sharper.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to smooth him,\u201d Rill said, thinking of wind and water. \u201cHe rubs against everything and gets more cutting.\u201d\n\nThe Assembly met under the Jetty of Glass when they needed to speak without wind. That place, the Jetty, had been a row of moorings once, which a storm had shivered and the shards of it had been stacked, then the light had learned to fold itself there. Sprites liked the Jetty because it reminded them the world was made of many pieces and would be, even if they wanted it to be a clean stripe. Rill and Kettle went by the back way under the salt-arches where the ghosts of fishermen\u2019s curses lived. They found Elder Thatch on a crate, his beard full of knots like a map.\n\n\u201cRill,\u201d he said, fogging his own name. \u201cWe have need of you. Brownsea\u2019s north grove has a\u2026 shard. A shard-of-ebbing. A key. It should be here.\u201d He held out a string in his hand. It had three knots. It had been broken.\n\n\u201cDear salt,\u201d Kettle murmured. \u201cWho tugged that?\u201d\n\nThatch made a face at the knots as though he could scold them back. \u201cWe did not. We guard. But the squirrel people stopped coming two months ago, and the badgers sleep a cold sleep, and the nights there are loud with something unsaid. We went to see. We did not go further when the ground hummed. Rill. You go. This is what you are for.\u201d\n\nRill took the string in both hands. It told him nothing. The missing tail gave away everything. He let it slide over his fingers, felt each knot\u2019s old stories chafing: an oath, a debt, a floor swept with leaves. \u201cWhy me,\u201d he said quietly, although he knew. Doors and lines and whatnot. Particulars.\n\nElder Thatch shrugged, a suggestion of a wave under that coat. \u201cBecause you can pull the end without unmaking the beginning, and we are old and clumsy and loud. Because you look at a knot and see the breath left in it. Because he will be there making noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrin,\u201d Kettle said. She tried saying it the way you might say a small misstep, a stubbed toe. It still came out like the edge of a blade.\n\n\u201cIf a thing can be ruined by laughter,\u201d Elder Thatch said, and his eyes went to the broken string in his hand, \u201cit\u2019s not worth keeping.\u201d It sounded brave. It sounded like something someone had told him. He looked suddenly very tired. \u201cBut some things are worth keeping and can stand being laughed at if the laughter is the right sort. Grin\u2019s sort is\u2026 no. Will you go.\u201d\n\nRill rubbed his lips. He had the taste of brine and old sodden rope on his tongue. He saw again the man with the bottle, the way his shoulders had dropped when he\u2019d set his ear to the glass. He thought of the grandmother oak with a mouth cut into her. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd\u2026 if I go, Kettle comes. And Needle if she\u2019ll have it.\u201d\n\nKettle arched an eyebrow at him. \u201cI always come.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot always,\u201d Rill said. But she did now. She made a face at him that said shut up and also that she would punch anyone who said she couldn\u2019t.\n\nNeedle arrived by accident, as she always did, sidling from a coil of rope with a bit of iron spit between her teeth. Needle was small even for a sprite and sharp in every way a word could be sharp: witty, angular, piercing. She adjusted her thimble hat. \u201cDid someone mention my name with intent,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause that has legal ramifications.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to Brownsea,\u201d Rill said. \u201cThere\u2019s a shard that hums and a door that needs fingers. And there\u2019s someone who will be there. With a mouth.\u201d\n\nNeedle\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cYou debt me four oyster shells from last week, Rill. This will make us even.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we not dead in a ditch of doom yet,\u201d Kettle said, mock-cheery. \u201cLet\u2019s go before we are.\u201d\n\nThe night gave them a boat because Rill asked for it correctly. He ran his palm down the side of a rotting skiff and told it a story about being young. The skiff blushed under the barnacles and remembered it had once been lighter. It lit them across the harbour like a skip-stone. The water tasted silver. Rill leaned over and touched it sometimes, to say thank you in the only language the sea never tired of, which is to say, touch.\n\n\u201cDid you hear about the lamplighter,\u201d Needle said after a while, as the skiff skated past a patch of dark water. \u201cWho lit a lamp at dawn and everyone said, \u2018Fool,\u2019 and the lamp said, \u2018You only ever talk to him when he lights you at night. You never ask me how I feel.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKettle groaned. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Needle said defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice joke. It comforts the lamp.\u201d\n\nRill smiled, small. It did. There were jokes like that. Houses have their own laughter; gulls too. And there were the other jokes. The ones that came in, took off their shoes, and tracked mud carefully everywhere.\n\nBrownsea rose ahead, the black of trees against a grey-black sky. The skiff bumped under an overhang of roots and waited. They slid into the north grove by a path no human saw. The ground thrummed under the balls of Rill\u2019s feet; he felt the hum in his teeth and right down his bones to the bit of peg in his left ankle where he\u2019d once put a splinter of mast to hold himself together. It was a beautiful sound, the kind that makes you think of big doorways that have not yet opened, of rooms so well-built that the air inside them has a taste.\n\n\u201cWe should go slow,\u201d Kettle said softly. \u201cThis is\u2026 a place.\u201d\n\nNeedle peered into the underbrush. \u201cIt\u2019s also a place with burs. Ow. Ow.\u201d\n\nRill crouched. He could see, in the packed dirt, the faint shine of a line that had been there and was not now. It was the scuff you get when a heavy thing has been dragged or when an intention has been changed. He followed it to a small rise where the old badger set had been. It was collapsed now, apparently on purpose; the collapse was too neat. He put his ear to the ground and listened.\n\nHe heard a song. Not a human song, not a gull\u2019s. It was a song of edges. It told him that a shard had sat here, like a museum piece tucked into a pocket of dirt, humming to keep the soil from forgetting. It told him that the shard had been a key that didn\u2019t know the name of its door but knew it was important to keep small hands busy. It told him that three nights ago, someone had lifted it with reverence and kicked the makeshift plinth to show that they didn\u2019t need to bow to old layouts.\n\nHe lifted his head. \u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d he said, and the word had no weight left in it. \u201cIt\u2019s been gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Kettle said superfluously. \u201cHe?\u201d\n\n\u201cLikely.\u201d Rill stood and his knees popped like old bubbles. He touched the fringe of the hole. There, tongueing the edge, was a thread of red. Grin\u2019s least favorite color. He\u2019d used it here. That was rude in so many directions Rill couldn\u2019t count them all. He plucked the thread and held it to his nose. It smelled of wharf rope and smoke and the strange sweetness that comes from the inside of a joke. He handed it to Needle. She took it with her thimble and did not let it touch her skin.\n\nThere was a movement in the trees. All three sprites stilled as if they\u2019d never moved, never would again. A branch swung. A pair of eyes blinked, luminous. A human stepped out.\n\nShe was a child, which for humans meant she was monstrous in size and yet very new. She had a red jacket zipped wrong; her hood had ears but they were not her ears. She had a torch. It swung. The light on their faces must have looked like a caved-in star.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said, because most human children are born with more courage than good sense. \u201cAre you fairies.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call us that,\u201d Needle said reflexively. \u201cIt\u2019s a misnomer and an insult.\u201d\n\nKettle jabbed her with an elbow as big as a peach. \u201cWe\u2019re sprites,\u201d she said in a voice that an adult would have heard as wind in leaves, but children hear truer. \u201cYou are out too late.\u201d\n\nThe girl came closer, stepping over the collapsed badger set without seeing it. \u201cI heard music,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFrom my window. It sounded like my granddad humming when he made stew. I wanted to find it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGranddad stew song,\u201d Needle muttered. \u201cIt will be written on the back of many cookbooks.\u201d\n\nRill lifted his eyes to the girl\u2019s face. Her cheeks were freckled like someone had sprinkled nutmeg there. Her eyes were full of God-knows-what. He liked children. They were like new knots. Not tight yet. He had found a dozen in his life who could see him and a hundred who could not. He always took it as a sort of compliment when he was seen. It meant he had not over-worn his edges.\n\n\u201cYou should go home,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should follow your torch back.\u201d He put a bit of weight in his words so she would want to. It usually worked. It did not now.\n\n\u201cThe music stopped,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to make it go again.\u201d She put her hand out to them in a gesture that made Rill\u2019s heart do a quick wrong flip. She would fall in love very easily when she grew. Or she would fall into something else. He didn\u2019t know. He took a step back so he wouldn\u2019t be touched. Sprites and humans touching was complicated and sticky.\n\nThen the ground under all their feet exhaled and became less ground and more water. The hum gathered, knotted itself, and lifted in a wave. The girl squealed and went down on one knee, her torch skipping. Rill did not think. He had a peculiar skill that the Assembly did not like him to demonstrate but which he had taught himself on long evenings when the gulls were low. He could hook a heartbeat. He threw his left hand, the liar, and his right, the knotter, and caught the girl\u2019s pulse between them as if it were a bead on a string. He tugged. It brought her center back to where it should be. She did not fall fully. The wave passed. The girl looked at him as if he\u2019d told her a story only she could hear.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Needle said, her voice very small. \u201cYou\u2019ll get your hands filled with someone else\u2019s rhythm and then what? What if you can\u2019t empty them.\u201d\n\nKettle put a hand on the girl\u2019s shoulder, gentler than buttering toast. \u201cHome,\u201d she said again. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nAnd then a second light appeared between the trees, and laughter\u2014cruel only because it didn\u2019t belong\u2014came with it, skipping like a stone. Grin. He was perched on the low branch of a hornbeam, and his legs, dangling, were rhythmic. He clapped. \u201cRescue!\u201d he called. \u201cBravo! Round of applause, except we have no round hands. Ah well.\u201d He swung down and bowed to the child. \u201cDid anyone ever tell you to walk into the best part of a forest with a torch and a question? No? That\u2019s bad parenting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you,\u201d the girl whispered. She did not recoil. He had that effect. Moths. Flames. The tired old metaphor was tired and old for a reason.\n\n\u201cI am a person with a joke,\u201d Grin said seriously. \u201cWould you like to hear it? It\u2019s a good one. It\u2019s about people who think the world is real. Haha! I\u2019m kidding. The world is real.\u201d He put a finger on his lip. \u201cUp to a point. It\u2019s\u2026 historically real.\u201d He looked past the child at Rill and made a very small shrug. The kind that says: I\u2019m doing this because you aren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Rill said.\n\n\u201cWhy not,\u201d Grin said with a wide-eyed innocence that would have been convincing if the lights had not shuddered at the corners of his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful joke. I can only make it once. Everyone will be thrilled\u2014later.\u201d\n\nKettle stepped between the child and Grin, brazier catching the torchlight and making gold patterns on the leaves. She was not big enough, no one ever was, but she placed her body with authority. \u201cNo jokes here.\u201d\n\nGrin stood on his toes and peered over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll tell it when she\u2019s gone then. Rill? Did you come for the shard? Did you come with your clever fingers? I was going to leave it for you as a present. But then I thought\u2014no. No. It will be more\u2026 comedic if you have to chase.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it back,\u201d Rill said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t yours to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTo what? To poke? To prop? To pry. Words are doors. We all know it. You just like to pretend your doorways don\u2019t go to bad places. Sweet Rill. The world has bad places that are also right. If you build a gate, someone should use it. Otherwise why build the gate.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s torch flickered. The night seemed to take a breath. Kettle made the decision. She pushed the girl gently back the way she had come. \u201cFollow the smell of chocolate,\u201d she said in the tone of a spell, \u201cand you\u2019ll find the path.\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes widened as if she could smell it already. She backed, then turned, then ran. The trees made room for her because Kettle had told them to.\n\nRill stepped forward. \u201cYou touch her again and I\u2019ll tie your laughter to your teeth,\u201d he said, his voice even. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to spit it out to breathe.\u201d\n\nGrin\u2019s eyes glittered in the torch-skim. \u201cPromises,\u201d he sighed. \u201cSo heavy. I\u2019ll make you a promise too. I will hurt no child. I will hurt everyone else. And everyone will laugh. And that\u2019s the wicked joke.\u201d\n\nNeedle, whose patience was always thinner than a gull\u2019s patience with a chip bag, said, \u201cYou loathsome twig. You coward. You can\u2019t even do wickedness straight. You have to hide it behind a pun.\u201d She took a step as if to stab him with her needle, which she did in fact carry, the iron glinting.\n\n\u201cAh, ah,\u201d Grin said, wagging. \u201cDon\u2019t stab me. It will make me leak jokes everywhere and then no one will be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the shard,\u201d Rill said. He felt the question as a thread in his tongue.\n\nGrin lifted his hands in a theatrical, innocent gesture. They were empty. He tapped his jacket, his pockets. \u201cOops,\u201d he said. \u201cNow where did I put the end of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop it,\u201d Kettle groaned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not starting it,\u201d Grin said. \u201cIt was started long before I got here. I just\u2026 punch it up. Don\u2019t you love the phrase? Punch up. Punchlines. Lines that punch. Gates that open when you tap them just right. We\u2019re all perched on the end of a sentence and it\u2019s a long one and it has too many commas.\u201d\n\nHe turned. He was gone. It was a wink, a blink, and he had folded into the shadow behind the hornbeam, as if someone had shut him in a book. Rill threw after him the sort of knot you throw at running things, which is to say a looping slip of will that makes anchors of ankles, but it passed the shadow and found only a rabbit. The rabbit yawned and scratched and went home.\n\nKettle crouched and pressed both palms into the earth. \u201cHe took it,\u201d she said in the flat voice of someone reading a fact. \u201cHe took it and he will make a joke with it.\u201d\n\nRill knelt too. The hum in the ground was less now, like a song after someone has closed a door. He stuck his hand into the collapsed earth until dirt lined his wrist and came back with nothing. He put his palm flat on the dirt and pressed until he could feel the world\u2019s breath again.\n\n\u201cI can follow him,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThere\u2019s a\u2026 sliver he always leaves. He can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s a piece of his mouth he doesn\u2019t use. It tastes like copper.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t lick the earth,\u201d Needle said. \u201cAgain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Rill said indistinctly because he had indeed just done it. \u201cHe\u2019s going to the chalk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cliff,\u201d Kettle said. Her voice was unhappy. \u201cHe\u2019s going to tell a joke to the cliff? That\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRude,\u201d Needle supplied.\n\n\u201cExtremely rude,\u201d Kettle agreed. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Before he finds a better audience.\u201d\n\nThey took the path that wasn\u2019t a path, the one that went sideways. Rill liked those. He\u2019d always been partial to diagonals. He whistled once, a sound pitched in the notch between cricket and kettle, and a cormorant, black as silence, dropped from the air and folded its feet neatly on a post as they passed. It watched them with the old intelligence of ungentled things. Rill pressed a knuckle to its beak in greeting.\n\nThey cut along the edge of the harbour where the lights made lanes. Rill kept his eyes on the dark beyond them, the line between where things are and where they are not. He had learned his way around those lines. He had built a life of it. He was good at it. The harbour sucked at its teeth. He thought of the child\u2019s heartbeat stuck a moment in his hands. That was not his job. He\u2019d always told himself that. He was for edges and doors and things you could pull gently and they gave. Not for beating back waves. Not for standing between.\n\nSomewhere in the flat of the mid-water, a pod of dolphins rolled. He saw their backs. He tucked the sight behind his ribs like a penny.\n\nThey reached the chalk cliffs just as the moon got tired of the whole charade and went down to do something else. Grin was already there, and of course he was, standing on an outcrop that looked like a broken tooth. The wind up here was a different thing than it was at the harbour. It had ideas. It wanted to throw. Grin had his hands in his pockets, and his jacket was wrong for the weather; it always was.\n\n\u201cTell me you\u2019ve not yet told it,\u201d Rill said without preamble. The sky tasted of iron.\n\nGrin did not turn right away. When he did, his face was blue with the light. \u201cTell me you\u2019ve come to help,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cMy timing is good. The world\u2019s timing is better. I\u2019m going to marry them.\u201d He wrinkled his nose. \u201cYou know when you say a word so much it becomes a bit of paste in your mouth? World. World. World. We were all saying it wrong anyway. We meant something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me the shard,\u201d Rill said.\n\nGrin grinned. \u201cSay please.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Rill said, and he meant it.\n\nGrin\u2019s grin faltered. For a moment it became a real mouth, not a heraldic device. He looked at Rill. There was something like sadness there. Rill wondered, too late, if he could have been a different thing, if someone had laughed the right way at him at the right minute. And then Grin brightened and the moment was gone like someone had snuffed a match with wet fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, with a comical little wince. \u201cI ate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou what,\u201d Kettle and Needle said in unison.\n\nGrin patted his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not unsafe. I\u2019m just\u2026 keyed. And when I say the line, it will turn. On my rib. Isn\u2019t that awfully intimate? I feel very closer to myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Rill said again. \u201cDon\u2019t notch the air. Not with that in you. It will cut all the way through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help myself,\u201d Grin pleaded, and for a second it looked as if he meant it. He raised his hands, as if to attract the lightning. \u201cI have a terrible sense of\u2026 timing.\u201d\n\nKettle punched him. Or tried. He stepped aside. She almost went over the edge. Rill snagged the back of her coat with two fingers. The wind took that as an insult and slapped him. He swallowed it. Needle, who had no patience left at all now, threw her needle. Grin caught it. He looked surprised. He hadn\u2019t expected her to actually throw it.\n\n\u201cTell me the joke,\u201d Rill said, and his voice was the sound you hear when a rope reaches the end of its give. \u201cTell me the joke you think is going to change everything, and then maybe I can\u2026 knots. I can tie it. Make it safe.\u201d\n\nGrin squinted at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t tie a joke, Rill.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I can,\u201d he said almost kindly. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. I tie things that want to go everywhere. I tie them so people can use them later, so they don\u2019t cut their hands on them.\u201d\n\nGrin\u2019s eyes were full of the moving light of the sea at night. \u201cI don\u2019t want this joke to be safe,\u201d he said. He turned then and faced the cliff and spread his arms. The world held his outline in a shallow bowl like it might spill him. He shouted the joke into the chalk.\n\nIt was not obscene. It wasn\u2019t even clever. It wasn\u2019t filthy or full of knives. It was a pun with too much weight on its hinge. It was a line about lines and endings and the way we say \u201cIt will be the end of me\u201d as if it were a story\u2019s end and not a statement of geography. He made the end of me into the end of we, and he braced it between two bits of rock that had been aching for a lever since the day they were born from sea.\n\nThe cliff laughed. It had never done that before. The sound was old and huge and wrong. It rattled into the harbour and broke the smaller laughs into sea-foam. A crack appeared at Grin\u2019s feet, small as a hair. It widened. It ran away like someone on a tight schedule. It went under the water and kept going, because cracks do not necessarily stop where we think they should.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kettle said, but she was saying it to a tide.\n\nRill moved before he knew he had moved. He had a skill and he had used it on little things: bottles and threads and the breath of a gull caught in a shoal of plastic. He used it now on the air. He made a knot in it, a simple old knot, the kind you use to hold a tarpaulin in a gale. He threw the knot at the sound. It snagged for a second, and for that second the earth\u2019s teeth stopped chattering. Then the knot slipped, because he\u2019d tied it in the wrong place. The joke was too heavy for that tie. It was a lever and a guillotine. He felt it slide away from his hands like a fish that changed its mind about being a dinner.\n\nGrin laughed. He had to. He had locked the laugh to the line. He clutched his chest. The shard turned in his rib. He made a surprised face, like someone who\u2019d swallowed a stone and discovered it was actually a bell. He doubled over and laughed again. His laughter had an edge now; it could cut through rope.\n\n\u201cI told you,\u201d he said breathlessly, between laughs. \u201cI told\u2026 you\u2026\u201d He coughed. His eyes watered. He went to one knee and let his hands rest on the ground. The crack at his feet widened another hair. It gathered a family of other cracks and the children ran off together, screaming.\n\nRill thought of the girl. He felt sick. He fell to his own knees and put his face to the wind and said something in a language he only knew when he was standing where things began and ended. The wind thought about it. It didn\u2019t say no. It said: You are small.\n\nHe stood. He put a hand on Kettle\u2019s arm and on Needle\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop this here,\u201d he said. He wanted to add: yet. He didn\u2019t. He was not a liar with his mouth, only his hand.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do,\u201d Kettle said, and she did not sound like she believed in any answer he could give. She believed in him and that was worse. Needle swore in a way that made a spider nearby blush.\n\nRill looked at Grin, who had fallen on his side and was still shaking with the laughter he had wanted so much he\u2019d put it where his bones were. \u201cWe follow the crack,\u201d Rill said. \u201cWe follow it and we tie as we go, and we find where he\u2019s made the line attach to everything and we pry it off. And we find a joke that is better and put it on top of his and smother it.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cAnd we hope the world likes our punchline more than his.\u201d\n\nGrin looked up at him, eyes streaming. \u201cI told you you\u2019d help,\u201d he gasped. Then he laughed again and his whole body shook and the sea threw up its white hands and the shore of the island lurched as if it had drunk too fast.\n\nAnd somewhere in Poole, in a little house near the quay, a child in a red jacket climbed into her bed and dreamed that the walls were telling jokes to each other and that she had to tell them to stop. She said \u201cNo,\u201d and in her dream it worked for a second, and then the dream slipped, and she woke to the sound of something old learning to split.\n\nRill stood under a sky that was too big for what he had to do. He put his hands together. He was a small thing. He had what he had. He had the exact set of skills the Assembly had praised and admonished and had threatened to cut from him if he used them in the wrong place. He had his left hand and his right. He had the taste of rust and lark-song and old rope in his mouth. He had his own stubborn heartbeat. He looked at Kettle and Needle and nodded once because saying anything right now would be wrong. They nodded back. Their faces were all sharp edges cut out of morning.\n\nThey ran along the cliff as the world cracked, tying the air with knots that held for breaths at a time, choking the wrong laugh with right silence where they could. Grin lay behind them and shook and shook. He was happy, insofar as he could be. He had set the line in motion. He had told his joke. It would continue whether he was there to timing it or not.\n\nAnd Rill of Poole, who could in his own quiet way set things right, went to try to find the end of a laughter that was unkind and put a thread around it. If he could just get the right thread. If he could find the tail. He had always been good at that. There had to be one. There is for everything, he told himself. He told the cracked earth. He told the wind. He told the slow-moving ferries and the gulls and the stones and the ghosts of fishermen under the Jetty of Glass.\n\nHe told the world there is always a tail to pull, and in telling it, he felt the mad, bright cut of hope. He grabbed. He tugged. The air squealed. Somewhere, faintly, the wrong laughter hiccuped, and for a heartbeat the sound of the harbour came back clear: ropes and bells and the clatter of a pub door and someone telling a story very badly in a corner, and all of it ordinary.\n\nThen the crack answered. It said Ha. And the ground under them said Yes. And the sky, shameless as ever, pretended it had no idea what was happening.\n\nHe did not let go. He had not let go when things were smaller; he would not now. The line burned in his hands as if it were hot. He knew it would scar. He kept pulling.\n\nHe had never been afraid of scars. They were just knots in skin.The first place the crack tested itself was a gorse thicket that had spent forty-seven summers holding its yellow candles up to storm and sun with equal ceremony. The line ran beneath its roots like a bright idea, and the thicket, being a sensible citizen of the coast, decided, after some creaking debate, to become two thickets with a polite space between them. Rill, running crooked along the cliff with his breath a saw in his ribs, flung a knot into the gap and held it trembling. Kettle slapped a smear of blue clay against the raw edge and whispered the old ward she used for keeping her brazier lids from rattling in a blow. Needle trotted after, stamping iron filings into the seam so that the joke\u2019s edge would shy off as if it had seen a magnet it didn\u2019t fancy. The thicket, impressed at being addressed like a person, reconsidered. It stayed one thicket for three more heartbeats, which felt like winning the lottery while the bank was burning.\n\nThey learned the new rhythm as they went. The crack didn\u2019t cut straight; no clever thing ever does. It sought old weaknesses to hide its innovation, following salt lines and rabbit runs, kissing a fissure that had been lonely since the winter of 1972 when a cargo lorry, lost in fog and contrition, had pressed too hard on the verge. There, Rill\u2019s rope-sense made him curse under his breath because he could feel the laughter riding ahead of the split, a flock of sharp little ha-has crowding into crevices like starlings, making roosts of cavities, planning mischief. He threw his left hand at them and missed deliberately, letting the false throw draw the sound toward him as a gull will swoop to a hand that never had a chip in it, only to be outwitted by the second hand that does. With his right he tied a sailor\u2019s stopper across the mouth of a hole and heard the chuckle go flat against it like a wave slapped by a pier.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t over-clever it,\u201d Kettle warned without looking up from her work gluing the air together with clay and a mutter. \u201cClever is how we arrived here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Rill said, and if he had been less out of breath he might have tried to sound offended on behalf of his own outrageous simplicity. \u201cI\u2019m using ordinary knots in extraordinary weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cSemantics,\u201d Needle said, which to her was an insult and a benediction in equal measure. She had a scrap of the red thread wrapped around her thimble so she could taste where Grin\u2019s trail had brushed the world. Every time the crack took a turn he would have loved, the thread warmed against her skin as if embarrassed. \u201cHe isn\u2019t steering it,\u201d she reported. \u201cBut it knows where he laughs best.\u201d\n\nThey chained the cliff together with temporary stitches and made for town because the crack had already beaten them there. Poole\u2019s night, which had been composed of good customary sounds, had acquired a new note like crockery being washed very briskly in a cathedral. They could hear the Twin Sails bridge complaining as if someone had asked it to waltz to a march. Each pivot groaned in its sockets. The cables thrummed. Down at the ferry berths, timetables untied themselves and drifted into the water like startled jellyfish. The gulls, who had learned the hours, argued bitterly among themselves about whether to trust laughs that changed the clink of a spoon on glass.\n\nRill slid to a halt under the first of the salt-arches and braced his hands against his knees. The harbour blew his hair back with a breath that tasted of iron filings and history. \u201cWe need more hands,\u201d he said, not because he wanted to be saved by a committee but because his fingers were full to the nail-beds with hot, humming line. \u201cWe need the Assembly\u2019s old knots and anyone with a pocket full of even-tempered jokes.\u201d\n\nKettle nodded, face slick with sweat that left pale maps on her moss-coloured hair. \u201cGreen George will have rope. Thatch will have stories. Nix owes me two favours and a bucket. We\u2019ll spend them.\u201d She set off at a trot, brazier clacking encouragement at her like a chorus of copper-beaked birds. Needle fell in beside Rill and matched him breath for breath, which meant she was suffering more than she let him see. She had a way of doing that, and he let her because it would shame her to consider being seen needing.\n\nUnder the Jetty of Glass, the light was folded tight as a scarf and the ghosts of fishermen had gathered already, not because anyone called but because when the harbour changes its laugh, those who gave it their throats in life feel the draught. Elder Thatch stood dead centre with Green George at his shoulder, both of them wearing their beards and consequences with equal gravity. In the edges, lesser sprites in their particularities lined the pilings: Nix with her bucket and her unrepaired regret, Blot with his ink-blackened hands, the vine-twins with ivy down to their shins, Candle with a wick poking from his cap like a thought he intended to ignite later.\n\n\u201cWe felt the split,\u201d Thatch said as Rill ducked through, and the old one\u2019s voice came out like a rope uncoiling from a barrel, fast and steady. \u201cWe felt the laugh go into the water. You are bringing it with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to undo it,\u201d Rill said, lifting his stinging hands to show the bright line-mark scalding his palms like a lover\u2019s letters. \u201cHe set a hinge in the chalk. The shard is inside him.\u201d He did not say Grin\u2019s name because he didn\u2019t want to watch their mouths harden or soften the wrong way. \u201cThe line wants to be a river. We need to make it a string again.\u201d\n\nGreen George stepped forward and pressed a coil against Rill\u2019s chest. It was made of horsehair and willow and a stubbornness that had kept bridges up through twelve storms. \u201cThis likes to be tied around things that get away,\u201d George said mildly. \u201cIt\u2019s made of patience. It will remember what you ask it to remember if you ask with both hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not touching that,\u201d Needle said, eyeing the coil as if it had teeth. \u201cIt looks like it will ask to be fed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will,\u201d Kettle said, and took it, looping it around her shoulders as if it had always lived there. The coil settled like a cat around a waist that knew the give of ropes. \u201cI\u2019ll feed it soup and propriety.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also need a joke,\u201d Rill said. He tasted blood and a story could not tell whether it was his lip or the air that had split. \u201cHe made an ending into a weapon. We need a line that turns endings into tools for staying, not for falling apart. Something people can carry in their mouths that will weigh the laugh down when it wants to float.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a counter-spell written in silliness,\u201d Blot mused, ink on his fingers making his cheeks a map of night. \u201cGood. Those are the only ones that stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a lamplighter,\u201d Needle offered, though she gave the word with a tightness that confessed she was nervous to have her joke judged. \u201cIt comforted a lamp. It isn\u2019t a big thing, but it is honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonest makes a knot hold,\u201d Thatch declared. He plucked a strand of his beard and made a loop of it and flicked it to Rill as if to say, use what I am. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a child\u2019s word too. Children tell the sea no without embarrassment. If you can ask it as only a child can, the laugh will trip over its laces.\u201d\n\nRill had already thought of the girl. It made him feel like a thief to even shape the thought. He looked at Kettle and Kettle looked back with a mouth that had opinions about the use of children in work that smelled of sharp edges. He nodded before she could speak. \u201cIf. If her if wants to. If her no already lives in her without my asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d a small voice said from behind a stack of glass. Poppy, red jacket zipped wrong and ears perched on the hood like comments, stood with her torch held like a wand she\u2019d never asked for. Her cheeks were bright from running; her shoelaces were, in fact, untied. She had slipped in under the Jetty as if she belonged, which, for tonight at least, she did. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. The walls were laughing, and then they got scared of themselves and started hiccuping. Mum said it was the pipes and to go to bed, and I did, but the cracking noise made my teeth itchy, and my granddad\u2019s stew song isn\u2019t supposed to sound like that. So I came here because I saw you, and you are made of the same sort of sound.\u201d\n\nKettle breathed out very slowly, as if letting go of a lid while setting a simmer to where it wanted to be. \u201cYou are brave,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is another word for a problem when you are small and the world is not. What is your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoppy,\u201d the girl said. \u201cLike the red. Like what happens in the air when it\u2019s very hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoppy,\u201d Rill said gently, and the name tasted like pepper and paper. \u201cI took your heartbeat when you were falling. I should not have without your leave. Do you want me to put it back if it is still in my hand at all.\u201d\n\nPoppy blinked, then grinned a little, like someone being given a story she would be able to tell later to children who would laugh at the right places. \u201cIt\u2019s in me again,\u201d she declared with the sovereign calm of the very young. \u201cIt feels very tired, but it\u2019s mine. Thank you. My mum says if you borrow something you should say what you did with it so the person can put it back where it goes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried that,\u201d Rill said gravely. \u201cIt resisted being told where to go. It is a sprite, apparently.\u201d\n\nPoppy giggled and then clapped a hand over her mouth because there was too much laugh in the room already and she felt it. \u201cI can say no,\u201d she offered, and the way she said it had absolutely no rust on it at all. \u201cBut the walls at home don\u2019t always listen. They\u2019re polite, but sometimes they say \u2018we\u2019re busy\u2019 and they squeak in the back hall anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWalls are notorious for doing housework when no one looks,\u201d Needle said, and a thin smile cut its way across her sharp face, unwilling and grateful for the company. \u201cWe need your no where the crack is not yet decided it is a road,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you put it there, it will have to consider manners.\u201d\n\nElder Thatch climbed down from his crate, each step an old decision re-made. He put his hand over Poppy\u2019s torch and the flame did not go out, because this was not that sort of story, but it leaned and listened, which was all fire has ever wanted to do. \u201cChild who chose us,\u201d he said, giving her a title because titles are old coats that sometimes fit new shoulders. \u201cDo you want to help hold the harbour together. If you do not, we will applaud your refusal. If you do, we will hum a stew song with you.\u201d\n\nPoppy looked at all of them, a small, singular person assembling a meaning for herself from old splendours. \u201cI don\u2019t want my mum to be sad,\u201d she said, which was the answer of a general. \u201cI\u2019ll say no where you tell me but I don\u2019t want to stand on anything high.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not,\u201d Kettle promised, and in that promise she tied three other ropes that Rill could feel: we will carry you, we will stop before you ask, and we will let you make the rule when we can.\n\nThere was not enough time and there was too much to do. The crack had threaded the quay and by the time they ran to the Twin Sails, the bridge had lifted itself an inch without being asked, as if testing poses for a dance lesson. The sewer beneath Rill\u2019s old plank had changed its cough to a whistle. Blue clay smeared under the bridge from earlier breathed in relief when it saw him, dimly alive to the notion that someone who cared about cataloguing wishes was nearby. He crouched where he had put his mark and felt the seam he\u2019d left answer his fingers like a cat pressing cheek to cheek.\n\n\u201cBorrow me,\u201d he told it, and the clay sighed petroleum and time and moved like a living tongue. He scooped it up and Kettle steadied the runaway bit into a loop around Poppy\u2019s wrist. \u201cIt will help your no stick to stone,\u201d Kettle murmured as she smoothed the cool weight around the girl\u2019s skin. \u201cIt will come off when you tell it. It listens to you now.\u201d\n\nOut over the dark, the ferry horns tried to maintain decorum and became a little hysterical, like vicarage teapots seeing a fire drill. The oystermen\u2019s boards clacked of their own volition, counting without being told to. Needle stepped to the bridge rail and threw her voice down into the piles, saying a word made of iron syllables so that the barnacles would hold tight for an hour more. Barnacles do everything because of pride; being asked properly is their favourite luxury.\n\nRill stretched his arms and felt his hands ache for the work. He called the map that had his harbour tucked into its paper like a sleeping cat. It came, convinced by habit and need, and flattened itself against the bridge where the gulls couldn\u2019t poop on it by mistake. It sang of its edges, and he heard the new line as a hiss being drawn across its belly. He spoke to it the way you talk to a frightened horse, telling it it was still itself even if someone had ideas. The map stilled. The hiss quivered. Poppy put her small clay-banded wrist upon a squiggle that indicated the mouth of the muddier drain and said no with awful precision, not loud, not theatrical, as if stopping a friend from stepping into a road because a car was there. The hissing at that place stopped and the map blinked, a cartography of surprise correcting its breath.\n\n\u201cYou are very good at that,\u201d Needle said, half to herself and half to the child, astonished that such a blunt tool could be so fine. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a magic no. It\u2019s a practical one.\u201d\n\n\u201cPractical magic is what kitchens are for,\u201d Kettle said with professional pride. She had the horsehair coil looped and was letting it unspool as needed, pressing its memory into the bridge so that when it lifted, if it had to, it would remember how to come down.\n\nGrin, somewhere behind the chalk\u2019s broken tooth, laughed again, and the laugh rolled over town in a sheet. All the laughter in the pubs stuttered, then changed key. The wrong laugh did not care about their stew song or their promises; it cared about its own success, the way a bad story cares about its twist. Rill flinched as if hit and tied two quick knots in his mind just to stop from tying them into air by accident. He had to be careful. His hands wanted to get to work everywhere, and everywhere could not be held by two hands.\n\nThey moved in a pattern that felt like a recipe, which comforted Kettle and steadied Rill more than he would ever admit. Around the bridge, under the greasy orange glare of old lamps, into the narrow lanes where everything was made of brick and opinion, they stitched and soothed. They asked a cranky drain that had thought to empty its belly all over a cellar to please wait and told it a joke about a bucket that thought it was a lake and the bucket calmed down out of embarrassment. They stood in front of an old bakery that had a row of cracked-glass windows like a grin and said no to the floor where the laugh wanted to draw a line up through the ovens, and the ovens, which had confidence in their vocation and a grudge against abruptness, closed their mouths in solidarity. They asked the lamplighter\u2019s joke to sit on the shoulder of a policeman who was using all his training not to shout at the night. The joke rubbed his epaulettes and he relaxed enough to ask the wind to breathe slower and the wind, chastened by courtesy, did.\n\nPoppy\u2019s eyes got bigger and then steadier. She began to treat her no like a paintbrush, putting it down in little flicks and long strokes. Her tongue poked out at the corner of her mouth when she worked, and every time she executed a proper stop the laugh skittered. Not all of them held, and when one slipped it made her shoulders hunch in a way Rill knew was not good for a growing backbone. He put a hand above her head without touching and took some of the strain, pulling the tautness out like old wire. She did not see him do it and that was how he wanted it. A child should not be a rope.\n\nThey took a breather in the lee of a warehouse where salt had drawn ferns on brick, and Kettle made everyone drink something that tasted like black pepper and low tide and might have been soup or spell or a lesson disguised as both. It put heat back where it had been taken. Even the cormorant, who had been following them with the offended dignity of a critic who cannot deny the good bits, blinked and sat a little taller on a bollard. Across the channel, Brownsea showed no immediate opinion of their efforts, which was either a good sign or the patience of trees who\u2019ve seen worse and refuse to be hurried.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to go back to him,\u201d Needle said, tearing a hanging thread from the cuff of her own coat and plaiting it with two others so her fingers had something to bite. \u201cWe\u2019ll be patching forever if we don\u2019t take the hinge out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Rill said, and he placed his sore palms against the cold-of-night brick and felt it approvingly hold. \u201cBut we cannot move him by will or by shame. We\u2019ll need to pull the shard through the line he made. He set the joke like a fishbone; we have to cut the meat around it and slide it out backwards, or we\u2019ll tear the whole throat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an image,\u201d Kettle muttered, but she did not disapprove. \u201cHe\u2019ll fight you because he thinks being pulled back makes his joke bigger. We\u2019ll need something he wants more than he wants the laugh.\u201d\n\nRill thought of the moment by the cliff when Grin\u2019s grin had slipped and a real mouth had showed through, tired and nearly tender. He thought of the old wish in it, the one that some of them shared, the one that makes you think if you could only say it right once the world would fix itself like a coat under a good needle. He felt a passing sorrow for a clever mouth wasted, which was dangerous because it makes you gentle where you should be firm. \u201cHe wants to be undeniable,\u201d Rill said. \u201cIf we offer him a denial made by something he respects, he will bite because he thinks he\u2019s bigger. He respects not being allowed. He collects it.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s nos,\u201d Needle said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to hear them properly. He thinks he invented refusal.\u201d She looked at Poppy, then at Kettle, and the corners of her mouth went strange as if she had swallowed three arguments and only one had agreed to stay down. \u201cWe can bring her no to him with a net around it so it touches only what it should. He won\u2019t be able to help himself. He\u2019ll lean into it and we\u2019ll pull. But we will not put the child on the cliff.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d Kettle said, and in the look she gave Rill there was a fair copy of his own resolve. \u201cWe\u2019ll carry the no like a lantern and keep her at the Jetty where walls listen and ghosts mind their manners.\u201d\n\nPoppy chewed her lip, considering the idea that part of her might go where she did not. \u201cI can make two nos,\u201d she announced cautiously, like someone offering a spare biscuit with the clear understanding that it was valuable.\n\n\u201cYou can make as many as you like,\u201d Kettle said. \u201cBut we will only borrow one. And we will return it with thanks.\u201d\n\nGreen George, who had listened with a carpenter\u2019s patience, pulled from his coat a length of grey silk as wide as a finger. It had knots down its length, each one a different sort: square, figure-eight, sheet bend, a whole rosary of securing. The silk smelled faintly of wet wool and stories told on boats after the tea has gone cold. \u201cThis holds declarations,\u201d he said. \u201cI had it for births and names. Tie your no into it, Poppy, and it will not fray.\u201d He set it out on a crate. The ghosts leaned closer, avid with an old hunger for craft.\n\nPoppy squared her shoulders and knelt, the clay bracelet catching Jetty-light like wet slate. She put her small fingers on the silk and said \u201cno\u201d as if she were teaching it to spell. It went in like a nail into good wood. The knot held. The silk warmed and the knots along it lifted like little heads, all of them saying we heard, we heard. Rill, who loved and feared knots in equal measure, felt his chest loosen just slightly as if he had been tied politely to the day and someone had asked him whether he wanted to be.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Thatch said, his eyes brighter and his beard heavier with a hundred places. \u201cGo before the laugh decides it can swim better than us.\u201d\n\nThey went, because when old instructions arrive in the right coat you run in them, not away from them. The path to the chalk felt different now that they had a thing to carry that could stop a joke. The wind, which had been argumentative all night, put its back into their going. Rill did not look at the sky for help; he had given up expecting cooperation from anything that never needed a knot. At the cliff, the crack had been busy during their absence and had reached two extra-seasons into the stone. The little lines ran like mice. The big one sat there the way a long word sits in the middle of a sentence, smug because it knows you have to say it before you can finish.\n\nGrin lay where they had left him, curled around his laughter as if it were precious and leaking both. His face had gone paler in a way that was not theatrical; it was the colour people turn when they\u2019ve been braver than their blood likes. His eyes flicked to them when they came because he could always find audiences even if they were composed of his enemies. He tried to sit up and his ribs told him a joke about hinges and he winced and laughed and glared at his own chest, betrayed by his own art.\n\n\u201cYou came back,\u201d he said, genuinely surprised and a hair grateful in a manner he would hate himself for later. \u201cYou brought a child\u2019s weather. That\u2019s unfair. Children have barometers that never lie. It takes all the sport from storms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe brought a no,\u201d Rill said calmly. \u201cAnd soup if you would like to be less clever while we work.\u201d He set Kettle\u2019s lidded tin to one side where the steam could comfort without promising more than it could give. Kettle kept herself between Poppy, who was not present in body but sang in silk, and Grin\u2019s eyes, because even looking is a sort of touch in the wrong story.\n\nGrin sniffed ostentatiously and then showed his teeth. \u201cDo I look like a person who eats soup,\u201d he demanded, affronted in that particular way only earnest generosity can provoke. \u201cI eat weather and blushes and the last bits of words.\u201d His nose twitched. \u201cIs that pepper. All right. Later. Show me your trick.\u201d\n\nRill held up Green George\u2019s silk and the knot that held Poppy\u2019s no. The no did not glow or hum. It sat in the silk as ordinary as a button in an old shirt, thoughtful, sure of itself. Grin\u2019s lip curled, then relaxed. He cocked his head. The laugh in his chest seized. He breathed through it like a woman who had decided to be both patient and furious in labour. He raised a hand and, delicately, the way he would touch a joke he respected even if it was not his, he reached toward the knot.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Kettle said, but she said it in the voice you use for touching a hot thing carefully. \u201cIf you touch it, it will be in you as well as your laugh. You will have to say no to yourself. It hurts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am extremely good at hurting,\u201d Grin said, and surprised them by not sounding triumphant. He put his finger on the knot and the knot did not burn him. It did not freeze him either. It paused his touch. It told him, clearly and kindly and without flourish, that he could not go further in that direction. It did not shame him for wanting to. It simply took the direction away. Grin\u2019s eyes widened in a way that would have been comical if it had not been so naked. That was the thing about a child\u2019s no. It is not a weapon. It is a road-closed sign in honest sunlight.\n\nRill watched his face and with the muscle memory of a hundred nights spent unpicking things that thought they were finished, he slid his hands to Grin\u2019s chest. He did not touch skin. He put his palms a whisper above him and felt for the rib where the shard had turned. It thrummed, a lovely, strange, ill-placed music. He had been right; the joke had braced itself between two bits of bone that thought they\u2019d been asked to hold up a song. He had to admire the craft of the disaster even while he undid it. He told Grin what he was doing because it is rude not to explain when you are about to untie someone\u2019s inside ideas, even if that someone is an irritation and a risk.\n\n\u201cI will pull the hinge through the line you made,\u201d he said, and he let his voice sit quietly on the air because shouting at air is like kicking a river. \u201cIt will feel like hearing yourself say a word you said yesterday again, but wrong. Don\u2019t try to fix it. Let it be wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI despise wrongness I did not choose,\u201d Grin breathed, eyes wet with laughter that was beginning to frighten even him. He put his clever mouth in a line. \u201cDo it. Do it. If you are to thwart me, do it better than I thwarted myself.\u201d\n\nPoppy\u2019s no stayed where it was supposed to stay, and Rill, holding its tether, moved his left hand in a small arc while his right curled the air flat against Grin\u2019s heart. He found the tail. He knew it by the way it wanted to be a beginning while being placed foolishly in an ending. He tugged and the world hiccuped again and Kettle made a wordless sound that meant she would hold something that broke if everything else went wrong. Needle, whose job it was to make holes orderly, caught the loose laughter falling out with her thimble and popped it like a fish eye. It stank of puns. She did not flinch.\n\nThe shard came carefully, reluctantly, a sliver of chalk with a varnish of old ebb on it. It slid through the line of the joke like a needle through envy and came away singing to itself about sea and distance and how it was built for slotting into edges, not for sitting in a chest where ribs are playing cards. Grin gasped. He stopped laughing because there was no hinge now and what came out of him was not a laugh but a sound people make when they see a cliff and understand cliffs. He clutched the space above his heart and glared at Rill with murderous gratitude.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t break it,\u201d Rill said softly to Needle, who was already considering how to stab the song quiet just in case. He set the shard upon the silk, far from the no but near enough that they might advise one another. The ground under them tried a feeble ha and failed in the face of a refusal it could not misinterpret. The big crack, deprived of its weight, ceased being a line and became a wobble. The little ones sat down like children who have been told gently by a kind person that the game is over.\n\nKettle bent and pressed a damp cloth she had not had a moment ago to Grin\u2019s throat. He flinched and then leaned into it because his body was a better person than he was. \u201cYou are not allowed to eat keys,\u201d she told him with the patient fury of a cook addressing a goat. \u201cYou are not clever in that direction. Eat pepper instead. Eat the last two minutes of a bad show. Eat praise from people who didn\u2019t listen fully. Leave the world\u2019s hinges where they fit.\u201d\n\nGrin closed his eyes and the grin on his mouth faded to something that might one day be a smile if he spent a very long time practicing humility as if it were instrument. \u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d he whispered, and because he was him he meant the way his joke fit; because he was not only him he also meant what they had done to stop it. \u201cI hate you. Don\u2019t go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d Rill said, and because he was him, he meant: we\u2019ll stay until we\u2019ve catalogued this properly and marked the underside of it with blue clay so the water knows where to file the day.\n\nDown in Poole, doors stopped rattling their own handles. At the Jetty of Glass, the ghosts who had been leaning forward to listen leaned back and made a noise like ropes slackening in contentment. Poppy\u2019s mum stood in the doorway of her little house, hands on hips, and called her daughter\u2019s name into a night that had stopped pretending to be a comedy. Poppy sighed because she was needed in two places at once and it was a good problem. \u201cCan I go home now,\u201d she asked politely, as if they had been keeping her from bed by telling an overly long story about doors.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kettle said at once. \u201cRill will walk you and make walls behave if they forget you are their priority.\u201d\n\nPoppy set her palm on the silk and patted her own no, which purred like a contented kettle, and then she peered at Grin with the frankness of a child who has assisted with a public medical procedure. \u201cDon\u2019t put things in yourself that don\u2019t live there,\u201d she advised, and then, perhaps because she was seven and tired of being an occasion, she added, \u201cDuh.\u201d\n\nGrin laughed, just once, without architecture. The sound ran toward the harbour and made two gulls change their minds about a quarrel, and then it didn\u2019t do anything at all, which is to say it was harmless. He flopped back and closed his eyes and tried to thank no one out loud. It came out as a sigh with ambition.\n\nRill tucked the shard into his jacket after wrapping it in silk that had once been a prayer and more recently a fishing license. It hummed faintly, calm now that it was not misapplied. He would take it to the north grove and set it back into a bed Kettle would make for it from sand and nettle-rind and the whisper of badger thanks. He would ask it to hum softer until he could convince someone wiser than all of them to sing over it while the squirrels returned to work. There were logistics. There were always logistics. He loved them because they meant the world had chosen to go on.\n\nThey stood there a while, the four of them and the uninvited fifth who had made himself necessary by being unbearable, and listened to the sea re-learn its ordinary jokes. The chalk sighed in a long, delicious release like a tooth taken out that had ached for weeks and was now allowed to surprise itself by being gone. The sky behaved like a sky. The wind made sassy remarks about everyone\u2019s hair and then remembered it was not the main event.\n\nWhen they finally moved, it was together, in the haphazard grace of people whose feet have learned each other. Kettle took Poppy\u2019s clay wrist and Needle carried the silk with its new knot like she was escorting a duchess who happened to be a word. Rill slid Grin\u2019s arm across his shoulders and took more of his weight than the other would have allowed if he had been fully present. They went back down the sideways path, and the cormorant, after a considerable pause in which it weighed the aesthetics of companionship against its cachet for solitude, unfolded its wings and followed at a distance, pretending it was coincidental.\n\nUnder the Jetty, the Assembly had put a pot on. That is the other sort of magic, the one that makes you cry with relief because someone remembered you have a stomach and a future. They ate and reported and unrolled the night and re-rolled it in better order. Poppy sat on Thatch\u2019s crate telling him very seriously about granddad\u2019s stew song and which bit was the high part. He learned it in two tries because he had been listening for lessons like that his whole life. Needle rested her head in Kettle\u2019s lap for three breaths and then got up cross because she had been kind to herself in public. Green George bound Rill\u2019s palm with a strip of an old flag from a boat that had never sunk, and the burning line on his skin went from having its own opinions to being a memory that could be kept without being caged.\n\n\u201cYou need sleep,\u201d Kettle told everyone as if she could hand it out. \u201cAnd then we need to plant nettles and apologise to an oak. And we need to consider why bad jokes have such good teeth when the wind is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we believe in endings too much,\u201d Thatch said, stroking his beard as if maps could be calmed with the correct smooth. \u201cWe tell ourselves we are smaller than we are and that endings are larger and they are not. They are just points at which someone has run out of breath. Breathe more. That\u2019s my advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy advice is to feed your enemies soup,\u201d Kettle said. \u201cIt slows them and makes them remember they have tongues for taste and not only for weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy advice is to learn funnier puns,\u201d Needle said with murderous cheer. \u201cThe ones we used tonight were a disgrace. I can find a dozen worse in the time it takes to boil a kettle. Better, I mean. Worse. You see the problem.\u201d\n\nRill looked at Grin, who had taken himself to the shadow where people stand when they know they are not welcome but cannot yet leave because the leaving would be a statement and they are not ready to be sentenced. He went over, carrying the shard-wrapped jacket carefully like an egg in a paper bag. He stopped two arm-lengths away and did not make his face kind; kindness would chafe just now.\n\n\u201cYou will say you meant to test us,\u201d he said evenly, saving Grin some effort by speaking his next three lines for him. \u201cYou will say this proved something about strength and about how laughter behaves under pressure and how you were useful. You will also say, later when you are tired and there is no one to impress, that it was beautiful and you wanted to see if beauty was bigger than attention. You can say all of those things if they help you make a shape you can wear. But hear this: you misused a key. You set an ending on the wrong hinge, and if we had not been there a child would have carried more weight than she should. There is no joke that makes that part all right.\u201d\n\nGrin\u2019s throat moved. He stared at the Jetty\u2019s stacked light as if reading something scratched on it in a hand he half remembered. \u201cIt is unbearable,\u201d he said at last, voice that thin metal some voices become when they have been used for cutting and then regret it afterward. \u201cBeing the person who is clever and wrong. It is also very funny. I will get better. Not better at being bad. Better at being precise.\u201d He looked up with something like humility lodged where his smugness lived. It would need feeding if it were to stay. \u201cWhen I ask you to pick a lock for me later, will you say no once and yes second and make me earn it.\u201d\n\nRill sighed with a long patience he had learned from rope and ruin. \u201cIf it is a lock that hurts someone, I will take your fingers off it,\u201d he said, because promises should be precise too. \u201cIf it is a lock that holds an old hurt shut and you have a new bandage in your pocket, I will pick it and tell you when to press.\u201d\n\nGrin nodded, then ruined the moment with a waggled eyebrow because he was himself and not another. \u201cI am very handsome when bandaging,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will swoon at my bedside manner.\u201d\n\nKettle threw him a chunk of bread that hit his chest with a sound that was practically a moral. He ate it because he had, despite protestations, a mouth designed for food. Around them the Jetty breathed. The ghosts slipped back into their swearwords. The map Rill had leaned against the bridge earlier rolled itself up politely and waited to be asked again on some other night.\n\nWhen dawn put its elbow on the harbour and peered in to see if everyone was decent, the Twin Sails bridge yawned and settled its pivots as if it had had a wholesome nap. The gulls took attendance and found no one missing who mattered to gulls. Rill walked Poppy home with Kettle on his quiet left and Needle on his prickly right and the cormorant above pretending it was studying a cloud. Poppy\u2019s mum stood in the doorway with an expression like a closed gate that has a gatekeeper who is also your mother. She saw sprites the way some adults can, not with her eyes but with the part of her that keeps the whole house in its head like a map.\n\n\u201cWas my girl a problem,\u201d she asked, measuring the words out like flour.\n\n\u201cShe was a solution,\u201d Kettle said, because the truth wants to be buttered. \u201cWe borrowed her no. It was returned with thanks.\u201d\n\nPoppy\u2019s mum pressed her lips together, swallowed three maternal lectures and made one instead. \u201cNo more night wandering unless you bring the walls with you,\u201d she said, then rolled her eyes at the absurdity and softened because every mother eventually has to laugh at rules to keep them fresh. \u201cCome in. There\u2019s stew left. It\u2019s better the second day, Granddad always said.\u201d She looked past them at the harbour that had decided not to be different in the essential bits. \u201cThank you,\u201d she added, not like a spell, just like a thing you say when something is given back.\n\nThey left her there in the light that comes through curtains like patient lace. Rill felt the weight of the shard in his jacket and set his steps for Brownsea. He needed to tell the grandmother oak it had been used badly and given back with apologies and to mend the cut mouth in its bark so no one could speak through it without asking. He needed to put nettles right-side-up and shake goose feathers from a fence that had been made to keep thoughts out not in. He needed to sleep for a week and would have to make do with an hour. He would mark the underside of this day with blue clay and catalogue it where the water would remember.\n\nAs they crossed the quay, the gulls tested a new joke, something about fishermen and patience, and it landed with a soggy wet. Needle groaned and Kettle laughed and Rill, a small thing made of salt and nettle and chance and an obstinacy the world had found uses for, smiled with his mouth and his hands and put a thread around the morning so it wouldn\u2019t run off before he could greet it properly. The line on his palms had stopped burning. It would scar, as everything worth telling does. He flexed his fingers and felt their particular set of skills settle like house sparrows into nests they had built themselves. There would be more cracks. There always are. There would be better jokes. That was the work. That was the bridge they would keep.\n\nBehind them, unseen because not everything needed an audience, the chalk considered the joke it had been told and tried out a new laughter, one that made ferns grow in odd places and encouraged oysters to speak to each other courteously about tides. It was not a bad laugh. It didn\u2019t break anything. It sounded like a harbour being itself under an unfussy sky. It sounded like the world refusing an ending out of sheer habit and kindness, which is the best sort of punchline to come home to at dawn.Morning wore its pale coat over the harbour and found the sprites in a boat that was in a good mood about being rowed. The water had a hangover from laughter but had decided to drink tea instead of regret, which is one of water\u2019s best habits. Rill held the shard wrapped in its makeshift silk in his lap and felt it patter against his knees like a small animal that knew its burrow was near. Kettle leaned her brazier against her hip and stirred the air now and then with the lid as if to keep flavour from clumping. Needle sat on the prow and counted gulls because numbers soothed her when jokes had been sharp, and when she lost count she hissed through her teeth and started again, which also soothed her.\n\nBrownsea received them with a courtesy it extended to guests who clean up after themselves. The north grove kept its hum close to the bark while they walked, the sound tucked like a scarf in a careful throat. When they reached the collapsed badger set, the earth had settled in a posture of embarrassment, as if it had toppled a tray at a good table and was waiting to be allowed to pick up the cutlery. Rill knelt in the dig and unrolled the silk. The shard blinked, if a piece of chalk can be said to blink, and exhaled a smell like wet stone and half-remembered songs sung at the edge of things. Kettle made a bed of nettle-rind and sand and a pinch of the blue clay taken from under the Twin Sails and murmured something that could have been a recipe if recipes called for apologies as an ingredient.\n\nThe grandmother oak heaved herself into their attention without moving and Rill bowed with his knuckles pressed to the ground because some elders prefer the earth to bear witness. He set his right palm on the cut grin and felt the cold of it still wearing a mischief that hadn\u2019t earned the right to live there. He smeared the thin coil of blue clay over the notch, pressing it into the wound the way you press paste into a child\u2019s scraped knee, firm and singing. Kettle blew pepper breath across the clay and the oak accepted the offering because it was practical, and nothing ages as well as practicality dressed decently. Needle shook iron filings along the wattle and the filings threaded themselves into the fence with the zeal of things that have found a use, and the goose feathers fell out one by one, realizing they hadn\u2019t liked being metaphors anyway.\n\nThey laid the shard back into the earth where the badgers\u2019 old rooms had been and the hum, freed from the cage of a rib, found its original octave and sat there like a kettle deciding to sing later when the kitchen was quieter. Rill\u2019s fingers hovered before he let them go, the way you hover above a sleeping creature because touch would be a theft even if it was also love. He laced a net of spider-silk over the bed and weighed the corners with smooth pebbles and an oath he made out loud so the ivy could copy it for the record. When he finished, the ground breathed and the breath did not try to be a laugh and no one anywhere mistook that for a small thing.\n\nThe squirrels came back with the casual entitlement of people who never intended to be gone long. One paused on a low branch and stared at Rill with a walnut in its mouth like a syllable it couldn\u2019t swallow without deciding what to name it, and then it ran up the oak and hid in leaves that smelled of repairs. A badger, not sleeping as cold as rumours had promised, shambled to the edge of the set, regarded the new duvet someone had made for its house, and made a noise that meant, in badger, I will not thank you in front of witnesses but I am making a note. Kettle wiped her hands on her skirt and put her head against the grandmother\u2019s bark and listened, then lifted her face and nodded as if someone had agreed to a change in the menu.\n\nWhile they worked, a thread slithered out of the shade and curled itself around Rill\u2019s left wrist with the sort of intimacy that makes you think you ought to have been consulted. It was red, not bright as a wound but old red, the colour of string kept in the back of a drawer for tying parcels to be left on porches in weather that wanted to say otherwise. Rill stared at it without moving his hands because his hands were not to be startled when they had just put a thing back where it belonged. The thread didn\u2019t tighten and it didn\u2019t slacken. It sat there with an agenda. Kettle saw it and made a face that was both I told you and also I am sorry about the telling.\n\n\u201cDoes it bite,\u201d Needle asked, because if it did she wanted to bite it first.\n\n\u201cIt binds,\u201d said a voice that had the creak of a long-lived crate and the taste of formal arrangements. Elder Thatch had not come up the path, and yet there he was, standing with his beard telling stories against his chest and his hands held in that placatory way old men hold them when they are about to announce a thing they would rather not have to enforce. Green George stood at his shoulder, looking apologetic in that way that means he had voted for the thing and then lost sleep about it anyway. \u201cIt is a Summoning Thread. It wants your name in a box where names go when the Assembly is ready to speak and the wind is not to be given the floor.\u201d\n\nRill turned his wrist so the thread saw his pulse and not his palm, which was a tiny discourtesy that threads notice. He lifted his chin a hair because small people spend half their lives learning useful heights. \u201cI hear you,\u201d he said to the thread without letting Thatch think he hadn\u2019t answered him. \u201cI have to walk a hinge to you or you\u2019ll make one for me and I won\u2019t like where it sits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d have put it at the Jetty,\u201d Thatch said, as if assuring a feral cat there was milk inside and also a door he promised not to close. \u201cThere is a matter to be spoken and we\u2019d prefer to speak it while the glass is listening and not the chalk. You can bring your friends or your enemies if that makes you feel more like yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we are coming,\u201d Kettle said with the offended domesticity of a person who intends to stand by a kettle until it boils properly. \u201cIf there is speaking about my Rill\u2019s name, we will bake that speech until it is edible.\u201d\n\nNeedle clicked her teeth and flicked a burr off her sleeve with a disgust that was disproportionate unless you had been teetering at the edge of cracks all night and needed one thing you could successfully remove. \u201cIf they are going to package him,\u201d she muttered, \u201cthey can at least let me choose the string.\u201d\n\nThey went by a path the grove opened for them because it had been taken seriously, which is all any place requires from those who pass through it. The cormorant had installed itself on a limb with the air of a critic relocated to the stalls from the gallery, and it watched their exit with a twist of head that said it would be delivering notes after the matinee. The harbour looked like a man buttoning his shirt after an argument, careful and not yet ready to smile. Rill unspooled the red thread as they walked and it paid out, not as long as it needed to be but longer than it should have been, which is the nature of summonses everywhere.\n\nUnder the Jetty of Glass, people had done the simple sacred work of sweeping and setting chairs. It is good for assemblies to start with the sound of brooms because it reminds everyone that decisions make dust. The ghosts had chosen to sit quiet for once and let the living talk, and the glass was folded over the light so that words landed and did not try to flee into the rafters. Elder Thatch climbed onto his crate and held a knot of rope at his chest like a bouquet. Green George stood with his hands in his coat and his coil at his back, and the others arranged themselves where the posts could lean against them for comfort.\n\n\u201cRill of Poole,\u201d Thatch said, and the glass scrolled the name in reflections so it felt official without being fussy. \u201cThere is a thing we have to ask, and it is not a request dressed up as a choice. It is a choice dressed up as a request because we are making it tidy to keep from being ashamed of ourselves later.\u201d\n\nRill looked at Kettle and she nodded once because her way had always been to show him the yes he could lean on if he wanted it. He looked at Needle and she mimed stabbing the air the way you stab a loaf to check if it\u2019s done and then quietly sheathed her needle because even jokes need houses. He rolled his left hand into a near-fist around the red thread to keep it from enjoying itself and spoke because silence is only noble when it does not want to be an ambush. \u201cAsk me, then, and do not sweeten it so much it sticks to my teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want you to hold a title,\u201d Thatch said, and he did not pause because pausing would let other people narrate the request with their fears. \u201cWe want you to be Keeper of the Two Ends. That is a job more than a name. It means the shard at Brownsea and the Jetty\u2019s glass will take you as a preferred route when they need to pass a warning or a hum. It means the lines that go out from this harbour and the lines that come in will have a person in them who can answer back. It means when a door is proposed, you get to test it before anyone shoves against it with a shoulder they cannot spare.\u201d\n\nGreen George lifted his hands as if to show they were empty of coercion. \u201cIt also means,\u201d he added gently, \u201cyou will be tied. Not in the way that makes a thing unable to run forever, but in the way that makes your first step always be toward us when the water is wrong. You would have to tell your hands there are places they do not lie and places they do, because some lies save and some lies are knives dressed for parties.\u201d\n\nRill did not move because there are moments when a person\u2019s whole life leans like a ladder and if you twitch the ladder falls. He felt the red thread tasting his wrist the way cats taste the edge of a bowl. He thought of the girl\u2019s no sitting polite on silk and of Grin\u2019s laugh turned mechanical inside a rib. He thought of how a harbour is not a line or a circle but a kind of cup you hold up to the weather in the hope it will pour you something you can live on. \u201cIf I say yes,\u201d he said, because good decisions always begin with ifs, \u201cI keep this hand.\u201d He lifted his left and let the thread see that it had not been given the right to choose him. \u201cI keep my liar. I will not promise to be honest where honesty is cruelty. I will promise to put a net under jokes that jump. I will promise to catalogue wishes even when I disagree with them because water prefers records. I will promise to cut lines that are cutting throats. I will not promise to be obedient if obedience is a joke told too long.\u201d\n\nThe Jetty liked that; you could hear it approve in the way the light held steady without flicker. Thatch exhaled as if he had been relieved of a knot in his gut that had been tied in a time before Rill\u2019s parents stood under any sky. \u201cI did not come here to tame you,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cThat would be a crime against salt. I came here because you already do the work and names keep the wind accountable when it tries to tell everyone that nothing happened.\u201d\n\nKettle stepped onto a crate of her own so she could look level at the old men who liked to think height had decided the question before the talking began. \u201cIf he is Keeper,\u201d she said, \u201cI am his Lid. When the pot rattles, my hand will be on it. That is not a title so much as a type of promise. Needle will be his Pin because knots can be undone and sometimes need something through them to remember their job. You can have our three for the price of one, but you must accept that we will take shifts at foolishness so it doesn\u2019t pile up.\u201d\n\nNeedle arched a brow with imperial insolence, then put her hand on Rill\u2019s shoulder with two fingers and a care that could have been a warning and was actually devotion. \u201cI do not accept your metaphor,\u201d she told Thatch, \u201cbut I accept the work. If he tethers himself to a thing with a fancy name, I get to cut the tether if it tries to hang him rather than hold him. This is not a negotiation, it is a declaration of tools.\u201d\n\nThatch laughed, and he had not laughed without weight on it in some hours, so the sound had a wheel to it. \u201cI will take three sprites and their vocabulary,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is better than many armies I have known.\u201d He lifted the rope he held and it was not rope any sprite had seen in a century; it was plaited of hair and river-reeds and bits of storm, and it was old enough to have listened to rules no one remembered writing. He offered it without advancing, which is how you offer a thing to a cat or a power. \u201cWe tie it to your name, not your neck. You can slip it if you break in half, which gives me comfort in a nasty way.\u201d\n\nRill came forward and set his right hand on the rope and his left on Kettle\u2019s wrist because it would be rude to let either think they were unconsulted. The rope was ugly and comfortable, a good combination for things that hold. He tasted ferric old rain when it touched his fingers and he did not shy away from the taste. Thatch tied two knots and then stopped and looked at Rill the way men look at a map that has offered them a short-cut and a story about a bog. \u201cThe third knot is yours to choose,\u201d Thatch said, and his voice had a wear that made it an honest gift. \u201cSquare and you will be steady. Slip and you will be quick. Figure-eight and you will be harder to crush.\u201d\n\nRill smiled, small and particular, because being asked to choose a knot is like being asked to choose a way to breathe. He caught the rope and laid an anchor bend that sailors use when they intend to leave but don\u2019t know when, a knot made for attachments that are important and temporary in the way all honest attachments are. The rope appreciated the choice; it settled against his name with a sigh like falling into the right bed at the end of the wrong day. The red thread around his wrist loosened, offended and impressed in equal measure, and lay sulking against his skin like a cat that had been invited off a counter by logic rather than by being shooed.\n\nSomething in the Jetty shifted delicately, a glassy change as if a window had been cracked the correct amount for air without drafts. Rill felt the line between shard and glass brush his spine like a tail taking his measure and he did not swat it away because you must not insult a thing you will need to ask favours of later. Green George cleared his throat and rolled his coil against his thigh until the horsehair hummed with approval, then nodded to Rill as if to say your anchor is decent and I will stop checking it for now. The ghosts murmured and one of them swore affectionately in a dialect no one living had the patience to learn, and the swear landed like a blessing.\n\nThey had not finished the talk when Grin appeared because Grin had never gotten the hang of entrances that wait for a welcome. He stood in the scrim where the Jetty\u2019s light did not quite reach and looked like someone had dressed a theory in a coat. The skin at his mouth was tender, not because he had been close to dying in a way that would make respectable people say his name softer for a bit, but because laughter used as a tool chafes even the hand that swings it. He did not try to grin and he did not pretend he was there by chance. He kept his hands out of his pockets as if he had been told once by a mother that this was how to appear harmless.\n\n\u201cIf you throw him out I will follow him and stab him in the hedge so he doesn\u2019t have to be lonely,\u201d Needle announced, which was her way of being merciful.\n\n\u201cI came to tell you the part that makes me look worse,\u201d Grin said, and there was a strange sincerity in the admission that made several barnacles consider revising their opinions of him by half a whisker. \u201cThe crack answered me because something else was listening under it. You felt it maybe as a taste of pennies or as the way your names got tight when the laugh went under them. There is a line under the chalk that isn\u2019t ours. It is very old and it has been polite because it was taught manners by rocks, which is the slowest school. I made a lever and it liked finally being asked to move.\u201d\n\nElder Thatch\u2019s beard rearranged its approvals and disapprovals and came up neutral while he thought. \u201cWe know about the old line,\u201d he said, carefully not saying its name because names make ruts and ruts are trails. \u201cIt is the seam that runs under Old Harry\u2019s bones and through the mouths of coves where people lose hats they didn\u2019t deserve. We touch it only with full pockets because it likes to take payment after you\u2019ve decided you\u2019ve paid. If it liked being asked to move, then we have offended it by assuming it would stay still for respect. That is annoying and educational.\u201d\n\nKettle exhaled a sigh that was three different household sounds braided together. \u201cSo there\u2019s an underlaugh,\u201d she said, making a new word because old ones had been used up. \u201cWe should have guessed. Bad jokes are rarely original; they are usually borrowed with worse timing.\u201d\n\nRill let the rope around his name sit and listened to the way the seam hummed now the shard was home. He could feel, like a draft through a latch, the other line Grin named, the one that lay like a sleeping eel under chalk and chalk\u2019s opinions. It had not liked being still so long that the first thing to ask it to get up was a joke. It wanted petitions, not pranks, and it would accept neither now without interest. \u201cWe will have to go find its end and politely put a stopper in the bottle,\u201d he said, and his mouth twisted because metaphors pile up and you can drown in them if you do not occasionally empty the bucket. \u201cWe\u2019ll need someone who talks rock and someone who has patience with the parts of water that prefer not to move. We\u2019ll need to stitch over Old Harry\u2019s toes with something that will not insult him.\u201d\n\nGreen George rubbed his jaw where old splinters had learned his skin and grunted approval. \u201cI have a length of lead line that has not lied in decades,\u201d he volunteered, tone humble because bragging at stones is a good way to fall off them. \u201cIt can measure depths without hurting feelings. Candle can talk to chalk because chalk thinks in candles. We will ask him to come and be useful instead of poetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlot should come,\u201d Needle said, surprising herself by complimenting a person she often called a smudge. \u201cInk knows the way words soak into porous things. He can persuade the underlaugh to take a different shape if we pour him in the right places. Also he owes me four curses and at least one apology.\u201d\n\nKettle looked toward the harbour mouth where the sea turns its head toward whatever larger thing is calling it today and frowned thoughtfully. \u201cWe will need to bring food,\u201d she said to no one in particular and to everyone at once. \u201cThe sort you can eat standing up because rocks do not like picnics and the sea has no patience for cutlery.\u201d\n\nThe Assembly unfolded into plans like a dress taken out of a trunk that smells of cedar and decisions. Rill stood with the rope around his name and did not feel captured so much as pointed, which is all a person can ask from a morning that was not promised to be simple. Poppy arrived halfway through a list of which coves sulked and which forgave and tugged on Kettle\u2019s skirt with strong little fingers, the clay bracelet now a dry band she wore with pride because something that had done work should be seen. She stood on tiptoe until Kettle bent and whispered into her ear, and Kettle laughed in a way that had spare warmth in it and kissed the top of Poppy\u2019s hood because it was rude to kiss a child who had not been asked unless you kissed the garment instead.\n\n\u201cShe says the walls at home stopped hiccuping when she told them the stew would scorch if they didn\u2019t settle,\u201d Kettle said, and Thatch had to sit down for a second because relief sometimes takes the strength from your legs like a debt paid at last. Poppy handed Rill a bottle that had once confessed to being brown glass and now had a nervous confidence. It was lined with spider exhale and smelled faintly of sugar because it had been used for cordial before and was now devoted to memory.\n\n\u201cI found a word in the drains,\u201d Poppy announced with professional pride. \u201cIt got stuck on the grill because it didn\u2019t want to go to the sea. It is a small word but it was crying in the exact way beans cry when they want more water, and I thought you would know where to put it if I brought it without tasting it myself.\u201d\n\nRill took the bottle with both hands because you take anything from a child with both hands so they can see where it went. He looked into the glass and saw the word rolled up like a mouse sleeping, and he put his ear to the mouth of the bottle and heard it say yet. He shut his eyes because there are words that, in the right morning, will fold you like a paper boat and set you down, and you must not let them see you sink for a minute because then they will feel responsible. \u201cI will put it where Grin can find it when he needs it,\u201d he said, and Grin, who had the misfortune of hearing kindness with accuracy, flinched like someone stung then warmed like someone granted a blanket against his own taste.\n\nIt was later than it felt when they let the Jetty rest. The day had decided to be ordinary with a stubbornness that lashed itself to mast and axle. Rill carried the bottle with the yet in it tucked at his hip and the rope knot on his name sat easy as a song you\u2019ve remembered three days late and found that it fits the step you are taking now. Kettle went ahead with a list of foodstuffs that looked like a prayer and sounded like logistics, and Needle stomped beside her making grooved plans into which puns could safely fall without bruising the passengers. Grin drifted at Rill\u2019s shoulder with the lightness of a person trying not to ask for escort and Rill, who had learned to be less stupid than his enemies, let his step match without announcing it aloud.\n\nThey made it as far as the quay before the harbour sent them a message the old way, which is to say with a bottle that had not asked to be a messenger and was now irreversibly devoted. It knocked against the pilings under the Jetty with the persistence of a child who knows there is cake and has not been told otherwise. Needle fished it out with her needle because that is an elegant thing to do, and Kettle flicked the drop of water off the cork with the contempt of a woman whose kitchen floor is her friend only when dry. Rill took the bottle and rolled it in his hands until whatever last word was sleeping there woke up and showed its tail.\n\nThis one was not a last word. It was a map\u2019s breath, a thread of river drawn wrong on paper. It tasted like iron and faint chalk and a shame that had been told to mind itself in public. Rill held it to his ear and listened without speaking because there are times to let a thing tell you what it thinks it is before you tell it what it is for. The breath said a channel had gone missing. Weller\u2019s Channel, the skinny vein that fishermen used to swear by and then forget in November when fog pretended to be a theology, had shrugged and slipped sideways.\n\n\u201cChannels do not get lost,\u201d Green George said from behind them with an impatience he wore on good days to hide worry. \u201cThey sulk. That is different. Lost implies someone had a map in their pocket and then lent their coat to a man who did not check his lining.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis one fell in love with the wrong laugh and followed it,\u201d Rill said, because he could feel the absence like when a loose tooth will not stop making a tongue a hypochondriac. \u201cOr it was told it could be an ending and believed the compliment. We will have to speak to it before the tide convinces it to try being a bay, and then we will have a foolishness that looks like elegance for generations.\u201d\n\nKettle set her brazier down with a thump that suggested it had opinions and she agreed with half of them. \u201cEat first,\u201d she ordered, because these were her people and that was the law that kept them clever instead of mere. \u201cThen we go pin a channel to its name and ask Old Harry to be generous with anyone who begs while silly. Poppy, you go home and tell your mother there will be stew again tomorrow and you very much intend to stop wandering without walls.\u201d\n\nPoppy made a face that was both obedient and dramatic, and Kettle hugged her hood because mothers who are not yours sometimes get to do that, and Rill knelt and let Poppy pat the bottle at his hip because small people deserve to confirm the location of their yet. The child ran away in the precise pattern of steps that keeps small feet from being noticed by large trouble, and the sprites stood together with sea in their ears and rope in their futures and a laugh they had taught to behave sullenly for the moment.\n\nThey ate on crates with their heels knocking against salt and their talk indistinguishable to anyone who did not speak the language of people who hold things together by habit. Rill put the word yet in his mouth like a sweet he didn\u2019t deserve and tried not to bite it so he could save it for later. Grin sat with his back to a post because even he knew where to put himself when he wanted the room to ignore him kindly, and when Needle nudged him she did it with her foot, which is how you say I have forgiven enough for today without using your mouth. The Jetty listened for a while and then decided to practice being glass for when the next crack asked if anyone was home, and the harbour pulled its shirt straight and planned its evening with an optimism you could pour a day into if you kept your hand steady.\n\nBy the time the tide turned in earnest, the plan had more legs than a spider and fewer than a millipede, which is the correct amount for plans with sea in them. They would go to Old Harry with lead line and ink and candle and ask the underlaugh for a bargain in the old words that chalk respects. They would fetch Weller\u2019s Channel back and stitch it so it remembered what being a channel had to offer that being a bay did not. They would set signs where the laughter had tried to make itself a road and label them with warnings that could be mistaken for jokes if you were in the wrong mood and needed to be indulged. They would watch Grin not because they wanted to catch him but because he liked to be supervised when he had agreed to try to be good.\n\nRill rose, feeling the rope on his name like a cat on his lap that had decided it would allow itself to be carried for a bit if the scenery changed. He looked at Kettle, whose hair had more weather in it than any sky deserved, and at Needle, whose fingers wanted to pick a fight with a horizon, and at Green George, who had coils and patience, and at Elder Thatch, who had a beard that could store winter. He looked at Grin, who was the sort of person you must look at and then remember to blink because staring rewards him. He looked at the harbour, which was his, and he looked at the chalk, which wasn\u2019t but tolerated him, and he let the map sing softly at his hip because it needed to.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, and the word did not have to be loud to reach the places that wanted to hear it. \u201cLet us go find the end of a thing that thinks it is an ending and remind it it is only ever a turn.\u201d He flexed his fingers and the burns on his palms chimed like old coins, and he smiled with his mouth and his hands and his odd, knotted heart, because he had been asked to keep two ends and that meant he would always have something to hold.They went out on the turn, when the harbour took two steps back like a dancer making room for a better move. The skiff that let them last night was sulking, so Green George bribed a squat, tar-bellied launch with the smell of horsehair and an old shanty hummed under his breath. It nosed away from the quay with the obstinate grace of boats that think they know the harbour better than you do. Candle arrived late and effortless, as if he had been standing in the wick of a shadow the whole time. He was not lit because that would have been rude in a morning, but he smelled faintly of bees and libraries, and when he breathed you could see the air consider staying. His cap had a stub of wick poking through like a thought he was saving for when people would be grateful to hear it.\n\nBlot clambered in with his ledger tucked to his ribs and a bottle of black that did not slosh but considered its own gravity whenever the boat leaned. His fingers were stained the way a map is, with intention and accident. He coughed as if he had swallowed a punctuation mark and waved off Kettle\u2019s look with the long-suffering dignity of people whose work stains them. \u201cIt comes off if you die,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cPreferably not today.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreferably never,\u201d Kettle said, and she tucked a lidded tin down among the coiled rope where soup could maintain the fiction of being a spell and a spell could hold the delusion of being soup. Needle took the prow as if it had snubbed her once and she was granting it the favour of her weight. Grin sat on the thwart with his coat buttoned wrong and his expression set to penitent despite his eyebrows\u2019 wish to be outrageous. Rill stood for a breath, letting the rope around his name settle itself, then sat where he could lay one hand on the gunwale and feel the water move with opinions under the paint.\n\nThey rode the harbour out like a sentence written with care. Old Harry\u2019s white shoulders showed themselves in daylight the way chalk always does, proud and crumbly, already writing their own erasures. Candle lifted his face to them like a parishioner remembering the words to a hymn. \u201cHe is old in the way that is not polite to remark upon,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut he likes to be admired and he will forgive us anything if we let him explain the weather to us for twenty minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more than weather,\u201d Needle said, pushing hair out of her eyes with a hand that had mastered annoyance. \u201cWe need his seam. We need his private line. We need to ask him to send his eel back under the table while we eat.\u201d\n\nCandle smiled with the patience of someone upon whom doors open because he never presumes to knock loudly. \u201cHe does not call it a seam,\u201d he said, and the boat shivered softly as if something trailing beneath had heard the capital letter and lifted an ear. \u201cHe calls it his thought. Chalk thinks very slowly, but when it does it is in long lines. He has a thought under him. You startled it with a joke and now it is trying to finish a sentence that has waited three hundred summers for a predicate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will give it one,\u201d Rill said. He drew the map onto his knees and let it sing low and domestic, the way a cat sings when it thinks you have not noticed it brought you a moth. The map\u2019s breath slid up around Old Harry\u2019s printed outline and hummed there, excited and uncertain. He put two fingers on Weller\u2019s Channel and felt the absence like a bruise. It had gone thin and sideways, as if it had been embarrassed by its own usefulness and decided to take up less space.\n\nGreen George stood to cast the lead and the boat scowled at him but made room because lead lines demand courtesies learned when ships were young. The plummet hit the water like a full stop and fell with an authority that made the weeds step aside. George paid out the line with both hands, calling the marks under his breath as if gossiping with depth. \u201cBy the mark five. And then a sulk. By the deep eight farther on. She\u2019s shifted her skirts, the minx.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe followed a laugh,\u201d Blot said dryly. He uncorked his bottle and let a thin thread of ink dribble into the tide. It did not spread; it behaved like a wire, sinking and drawing a neat line through the water that fish would later follow for the pleasure of pretending to be on a road. \u201cI\u2019ll mark the path she took so we can mark the path we will ask. Channels like flattery dressed as instruction. We will give her both.\u201d\n\nThe launch grumbled around Old Harry\u2019s white knees and slid into the wind\u2019s blind spot. The chalk was loud without making noise; the cliffs held the sound of their own collapse the way old people hold anecdotes about storms. Candle stood, took off his cap, and bowed to rock. He did it with the right amount of humour, as if he knew how ridiculous such bows look to people who cannot hear stone, and as if he did not care. \u201cGood morning, Harold,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cYou are looking crisp.\u201d\n\nThe cliff, which does not deign to turn its head, turned its attention. The sky on this side of the boat felt different, as if it had acquired weight. Candle spoke in a tone Rill had heard from women sitting too near ovens and speaking sense through steam. \u201cYou have a thought exposed,\u201d he went on. \u201cIt is not a shame. Thoughts must breathe. But this one has its shoelaces undone and the tide is a thief. Will you let us tie it for you while you finish, and then untie it when you are ready to speak the long word.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least he tells you what he is doing,\u201d Needle muttered to the cliff, which had opinions about needling and did not disapprove. Grin closed his mouth with visible effort and pressed his lips together until his grin had nowhere to sit. Kettle ladled out spoons of soup and set them on the thwart for the wind to consider, because generosity is often a better opening gambit than compliments.\n\nThe chalk replied the way chalk does. A bit flaked near a cormorant\u2019s foot, a rivulet of dust traced an old channel down, the boat trembled as a wave that had not been signalled elsewhere by wind riffled its skin. Candle nodded and translated for those who did not speak rumour-through-stone. \u201cHe says we are not wrong that a thought has its shoe undone. He says it has been listening to things it does not understand, and also to things it understands too well. He says he will not have us telling him he is in danger like he is a child, because he is not, and that he will allow us to sit and knit in his porch while he continues his thinking, provided we do not drop our needles where he keeps his fossils.\u201d\n\nRill grinned because there is no better yes than a cranky one. He turned the map so the printed cliff and the cliff itself could see each other out of the corners of their eyes. He set Green George\u2019s lead line across the chart like a vein. He glanced at Kettle and she set the tin by Candle\u2019s feet with a respectful thunk and began to hum Poppy\u2019s granddad\u2019s stew song very softly, the kind of hum that convinces a kitchen the hour is decent. The Jetty\u2019s silk with the no was wrapped away like a sacrament, but he felt its knot in his pocket like a coin he did not plan to spend unless the world shoved.\n\nBlot wet his finger in the ink and drew a sigil on the map that had no magic to it at all unless you count hands that have done it many times as magic, which you should. It was a net with wide eyes and kind knots, the sort that lets small fish pass and keeps boats from being stupid. \u201cFor Weller,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is shy. We tell her she is not a road, she is a ribbon. We tell her ribbons have important work keeping things pretty and together. We tell her she looks nicer straight.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not tell her she looks nicer,\u201d Kettle warned, wagging her spoon with the firmness of someone who has dealt with too many hearts for one lifetime. \u201cTell her she looks like herself when she is where she knows she is. Coaxing is good. Flattery is a spice you use after the stew is cooked and not a minute sooner.\u201d\n\nGreen George cast again and called out the old words, and the chalk sighed at being counted and slightly admired the rigour. The boat settled into a rhythm. Candle spoke to Harold about wind that came from the wrong direction three summers ago and left a taste like pennies. Harold responded by letting a flake fall near Candle\u2019s shoe in agreement. Needle, who had the patience of a person who has had to use other people\u2019s patience as a tool, did not stab the sea. She watched Weller\u2019s Channel with her eyes narrowed until she could see not where it was but where it wanted to be, which is what true sight is for. Grin did not speak. The restraint sat on him like a cat on a cushion just barely tolerating the cushion\u2019s pattern.\n\nThe underlaugh was there. Rill could feel it, that eel of thought under chalk, curled tight and pleased with being tickled. It had liked being asked to move by a lever that was not fit for it. It had enjoyed, for the first time in an age, a wickedness it had not invented. It was going to be difficult to tell it that wickedness made a mess and someone would have to clean if it got mud on all the floors. He put his palms on the cool lip of the boat and spoke in his chest because sometimes things under stone prefer vibrations to sound. \u201cWe do not come to stop you thinking,\u201d he told the seam in a cadence only Candle and a gull bothered to hear. \u201cWe come to show you a better joke. The one we carry is not about ends. It is about turns. It is about yet. It is an honest word. It tastes of stew and weather that is improving. Will you try it as a hinge for the while.\u201d\n\nThe underlaugh uncurled like a ribbon taken from a drawer where it had been kept for weddings and deaths. It slid up under the hull. The boat rose a fingerbreadth and stayed there. Candle lowered his lids, hearing slow stone change its mind about an adjective. Green George frowned, listening to the lead line tell him that a place that had been eight was now eight-but-cheerful. Blot dipped his brush and flicked a letter of yet into the water. It did not dissolve. It wobbled into a shape the chalk would recognise when it thought about weather next.\n\n\u201cWeller,\u201d Kettle said at the same time, and her voice went sideways under the boat the way taste goes sideways on your tongue when you think about vinegar. \u201cYou are not missing. You are sulking. Stop it. We love you. It is unbecoming to be loved and be missing at the same time when fishermen could break their ankles on your mistake.\u201d She ladled a circle of soup into the tide like a halo. \u201cCome here and eat.\u201d The circle drifted and then sat as if the water had suddenly learned table manners.\n\nChannels have ears when they choose, and this one had always been soft for Kettle because she had scolded it once when it was young and called it by its name without making it a shrine. The water darkened in a line no wider than a reasonably ambitious ribbon, and Rill felt a tug in his hands that was nothing like rope and everything like rope. He put two fingers on the map and three into the air, tying the one to the other with a thought so practised it let him breathe while he did it. Weller\u2019s Channel slid back into its old bed with the relief of a child returning to a favourite chair after trying to sit like an adult at a table too high.\n\n\u201cMark it,\u201d Blot said, and he lifted his brush. The ink did not spread; it sank and threaded itself through the water in a cord that would last as long as they asked if they asked it politely every morning and there was tea. Green George sang two marks and a prayer and the lead line agreed with both. Needle tied a little nothing on the air over the channel that would catch in fishermen\u2019s eyeballs and make them think, aye, there, without knowing why. Kettle tasted the soup in the halo and nodded because nourishment is all geometry in the end.\n\nUnder them, the underlaugh tasted yet. It did not accept it as a meal because it is older than meals and refuses to be fashionable, but it let the word sit on its tongue. The taste distracted it from the seductive memory of the end Grin had offered. It did not turn away. It turned aside. Candle put his palm on the launch\u2019s plank and made a small sound in his throat that might have been a hymn fragment or the remembered cough of a winter hearth. \u201cHarold says thank you by not saying it,\u201d he reported. \u201cHe says the new word is lacklustre and wholesome, which is a compliment in chalk. He says if we will please refrain from carving any more mouths in oaks he will consider not laughing at cliffs for a fortnight to give everyone\u2019s tiles a chance to sit in their mortar properly.\u201d\n\nGrin snorted and then made the sound into a cough because making fun of gratitude is a bad habit that ruins bread. He leaned over the side and looked down into water that had decided to be obedient without being servile. \u201cI have a suggestion,\u201d he offered, with the caution of a man holding a match over a hammock. \u201cWe take the yet and we write it where the laugh would go if it came back. We do not nail it in. We hang it like a coat on a peg. The underlaugh will see the peg and remember it has somewhere to put its coat. Then when it wants to go to a party it will at least dress properly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour metaphors are late for work,\u201d Needle said, but she did not dismiss the idea. \u201cBlot can write the word under the lip where only chalk and fish will read it. Candle can translate the coat-peg. George can measure the impertinence. Kettle can feed the coat because nothing behaves on an empty stomach. Rill can\u2026\u201d She paused, because she hated admitting she did not know a thing already. \u201cRill can tie the peg.\u201d\n\nRill laughed softly, which the chalk permitted because it was not a destructive laugh. He took the silk from his pocket and showed the knot that held Poppy\u2019s practical no. He did not untie it because you do not undress a promise to ask it to do tricks. He tied a small sister knot alongside, pale and similar, with the memory of yet in it and the shape of a hook with no barb. Blot dipped his brush and wrote the word in a script fish admire, under the lip of a ledge where crabs would read it and yawn and keep the secret out of boredom. Candle spoke to the chalk with vowels shaped like patience, and Green George declared himself satisfied with a number that would have been rude to announce aloud, so he patted the lead line apology into its fibers until it forgave him for silence.\n\nThe boat sighed like a person who has been sent to collect a parcel and found three instead. The wind let them alone for a minute in the way wind does when it admits it has been overeager. Weller\u2019s Channel stretched under their hull and rolled its shoulders. The underlaugh curled back under chalk and took the word with it the way a dog takes a glove to worry under a table later when no one is crying. Old Harry dropped a flake that landed point-first on Candle\u2019s cap and stuck there like a blessing with a sense of humour.\n\n\u201cSoup,\u201d Kettle announced, because the boat\u2019s mood had changed and she knew better than anyone that this is when a person falls over because they think the work is done. She handed spoons and did not wait to see if people would take them, because even the naughty eat when commanded by competence. Needle ate with austere diligence. Green George ate like a man who agreed with weather. Blot got ink on his spoon and then pretended he had meant to. Candle took three sips and sighed in a way that made the cliff more sentimental than it liked to be and made it pretend to cough. Grin ate, which was new enough to be notable, and when Kettle raised an eyebrow he jutted his chin. \u201cI can consume without performing,\u201d he said, and then added meekly, \u201cSometimes.\u201d\n\nThey went about the rest of the business that morning gives you when you ask without modesty. Rill checked the map for how the laugh had tried to creep into lanes and found the little places where it still pestered brick. Needle wrote down on her cuff the names of three groynes that had volunteered for buoy duty before they thought about splinters. Green George promised buoys. Blot made a note in his ledger that a channel had been retrieved with dignity, and he capped his bottle with a flourish that would read as modesty in the minutes. Candle tucked Harold\u2019s complaint about last winter\u2019s frost into his cap like a shopping list. Kettle wiped the ladle clean on the inside of the tin because that is a spell too.\n\nThey were turning the boat for home when the sea sent them an envelope. It came not in a bottle but in a raft of bladderwrack that had decided to be useful. The weed bumped against the hull and would not let go until Rill leaned down and accepted from it a packet of cold, which is how the sea writes to people it suspects will not misuse adjectives. He held the cold in his hands until it understood it had been heard, then opened it and allowed it to become words. The words were from the west, where the chalk thins and the mud begins to win arguments. They smelled of peat and iron and something like a smile you do not trust.\n\n\u201cSandbanks,\u201d Green George guessed before Rill could speak, because men who know harbours keep the list of likely braggarts near the front of their minds.\n\nRill shook his head and tasted again. \u201cNo. Studland. The heaths,\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cThey have not liked their fires lately. They say a laugh ran through their gorse last year and left splinters that itch when the wind is east. They think it heard today\u2019s, and it is up now, pacing. They ask us whether we mean to keep cheerfulness inside its fence.\u201d\n\nCandle grimaced, the way candles do when someone tries to use them to burn a house down. \u201cGorse does not like underlaughs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt holds its own laughter dear. It will set itself on fire to teach underlaughs manners. That is not the method I would choose on a weekday.\u201d\n\nKettle put the lid on the soup tin with a firm little click. \u201cWe will go,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cAfter we take Weller home and after I replace the clay under Twin Sails, and after Poppy is told she may not wear the walls as a cape in winter. We will bring water to the gorse because it will take it from me and not you, and we will tell jokes that make shrubs behave. Needle can bring the nasty puns. They are a tonic. Grin will not even open his mouth. I will sew it if I must.\u201d\n\nGrin put his hands up, which is a gesture of surrender made by people who plan to examine the bars of their jail for comedic potential. \u201cI will be mute as a volume of sermons in a pub,\u201d he said sweetly, and then spoiled it by making a face at Candle, who gave him a look you could boil soup on.\n\nThey slid the boat back toward Poole with the tide under them like a hand. The harbour\u2019s bruise was already fading, though the place would ache for a bit when it rained. Rill felt the rope on his name stretch and settle with the sort of satisfaction a person feels when their house has acquired a new shelf in precisely the spot a mug had always wanted to occupy. He looked at the faces around him, all of them built for different kinds of holding, and the soft, necessary ache that comes after a thing is not broken any longer knocked twice under his ribs. He put his palm on the map and let it hum to sleep, which it did with relief, because maps like to be closed when everyone knows where they are.\n\nUnder the Jetty of Glass, the ghosts had set out mugs. The Assembly did not swarm; it leaned, the way it does when it expects news from people it trusts. Rill lifted the lead line and let the plummet knock the planks twice, which is how you tell fishermen as ghosts that the tide has agreed to be sensible and they may go sleep without worrying that they will have to turn in their nets in the morning because a channel has gone missing. Thatch nodded gravely and the rope on his arm agreed, and for a moment the room was merely a room with people in it who had done a task and came back alive, which is the best use of a room.\n\nPoppy had been consigned to domesticity by a mother whose eyes had shadows in them like spare warnings, and so there was no small person underfoot to remind them all how easy certain words are. Kettle wrote a note with steam on Thatch\u2019s crate for the child\u2019s kitchen to find later, a recipe for no that involved butter and not being sorry. Needle sharpened her needle even though it did not need sharpening, because readiness tastes better than appetite when you have to go back out. Blot licked a thumb and smoothed ink that had lifted where a gull had been nosy. Candle set his cap with its flake of chalk on a nail and covered it with a cloth because respect is an outfit you keep clean.\n\nGreen George coiled his lead line like a contented snake, then let it sit unworried on the floor as if to say there, we know how deep you are for today. Rill set the bottle with the yet where Grin would pretend not to notice it and then, when he did notice, pretend not to know it was for him. Grin, to his credit, looked, pretended nothing, and tucked the bottle into his own coat like a promise he had signed for and did not intend to default on in public. He was very quiet and this time the quiet did not feel like wait-for-it, but like I am trying in the clumsy way of those who learned late.\n\n\u201cI have to go apologise to an oak and not be ridiculous about it,\u201d Rill said, and the Jetty\u2019s light rustled over him like a page turned with affection. \u201cThen we will pack jokes that shrubs tolerate and water that remembers rain. We will probably sing, which is alarming. After that, if the world wants an ending again, we will fling yet at it until it agrees to be a turn.\u201d He rubbed his palms unconsciously, and the rope on his name thrummed once against his skin as if it had laughed in private.\n\n\u201cDo not be late,\u201d Thatch said, indicating nothing and everything with two fingers and his beard. \u201cThe day intends to be long and will not be insulted if you get to the hard bits before lunch.\u201d\n\nThey split like sensible water at a keel, each to their preparations and the small repairs work leaves behind. Rill and Kettle took the sideways path because it was the shortest, and Needle Shadowed them with the particular offence of a person who has decided to be present for everything out of sheer policy. The harbour made itself a place behind their backs with the satisfaction of a dog turning in a bed it has decided to keep. From the chalk edge, a flake let go deliberately and fell, not as an ending but as a note in a song that had been waiting for a bar to fill. The wind got over itself. The channels checked their names. The gulls, having briefly entertained better jokes, returned to their traditional repertoire with dignified relief.\n\nThe grandmother oak of the Old Copse received their apology with the uncomplicated generosity of entities that outlast grudges. Rill pressed his forehead to the repaired bark and listened to it breathe around the blue clay like a mended pot saucepan sings when it has been fixed by someone who will cook with it the next day. He told it what had happened in words that contained their own mending and promised it a nettle bed thick enough to make the wrong mouths keep their distance. Kettle scattered nettle seeds with the tidy ferocity of someone setting out spoons for a wake. Needle stood guard in case Grin\u2019s name slipped through a syllable and tried to be clever where oaks preferred steadiness.\n\nOn their way to Studland, they caught sight of Grin where the quay makes a corner out of gossip and rope, conversing with Poppy across the demarcation line that all good mothers draw in the air when they have to let their child talk to danger without making a fuss. He was holding the bottle with yet in both hands the way you hold a small animal that will not forgive you for dropping it. Poppy\u2019s hood ears were cocked and her eyebrows were in their I am a good student posture. Kettle made a noise that meant she approved without being pleased. Rill slowed for half a breath and heard Grin say, with peculiar care, \u201cWhen you have a good no, keep it where you can reach it. Other people will want to borrow it. You may lend it. But you do not have to. Make them bring soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuh,\u201d Poppy said again, but she smiled, not cruelly, and Rill decided hope was not a mad craft even in harbours that had laughed in the wrong key two hours ago.\n\nStudland\u2019s heaths lay out like a rumpled blanket someone had kicked off in their sleep in the middle of a dream about fire. Gorse bristled obscene sunshine, broom flung up arms waiting for spring even when spring had gone to lunch, and the sandy paths remembered the feet of soldiers and brides and dogs with a democracy that would have made parliaments blush. The underlaugh that had been teased into waking westward was different here; it had learned a new hiss that involved dry stems and the whisper of something that had never liked being told it was beautiful. The air tasted like the inside of old tea tins, metallic and cozy and cross.\n\nKettle took the front because shrubs respond to authority the way kettles do. She had a bucket, which the heaths respected as a sort of priest, and a rag slung over her shoulder because there are always spills. Candle walked just behind her, eyes soft in that way that tells land you are listening to the story it tells itself to be itself. Blot carried his bottle of ink as if heath would forgive a stain if the proper penitent took responsibility for it. Green George had rope that grass likes; it does not chafe and it understands that it is a path only as long as it is asked. Needle had a bag filled with false starts and groans, which are the tools of pun warfare. Rill held the map rolled, because land does not like to be shown its picture unless asked nicely, and because the rope around his name had begun to hum in the precise pitch that meant the ground was already thinking about lines.\n\nThey stepped onto the first path and it muttered under its breath about deer. Kettle splashed a spoonful of water onto the path and it calmed, because water is the proper answer to most resentments that involve dust. On their right, a flare of yellow in the gorse looked indecently cheerful. Grin sucked air through his teeth and had the decency to say nothing at all. Candle cleared his throat and talked about fog in November and the way it makes the world kind because it insists on holding everything gently until you remember you are lost.\n\nThe underlaugh edged in, shy and provocative both, like a cat that wants a hand and will scratch if you do it wrong. It moved through the gorse in a sibilant flirtation, looking for the particular place where dry jokes turn to bad fires. Rill felt it and put his palm down, five fingers to earth. He did not try to tie it because you do not put knots on tinder. He spoke into his hand instead and offered the joke they had hung under the chalk, the yet with its hookless peg. The heaths listened, suspicious and tempted. Kettle set her bucket down and scooped water with her hand, flicking it into the air so the droplets became a string of pearls too pretty for flame to embarrass itself by licking. Needle told a joke about a broom who thought it was a match and was ashamed when it discovered its true purpose was to tidy up after other people\u2019s drama. The gorse laughed raucously at the broom, which is how you get gorse to let go of a plan to set itself on fire.\n\nBlot wrote on air with a wet brush so that when the underlaugh tried to run it banged its shins on letters and fell into a punctuation that did not hurt anyone. Green George set a line down across path and path lifted its skirts and stepped over it primly, thereby losing momentum, which is how you prevent tragedy at walking speed. Candle spoke to the heather the way you talk to a proud aunt, reminding it of winters borne and summers improved. Kettle sang Poppy\u2019s no at a gorse bush that had begun to whisper set me alight and the bush lost its nerve and offered bees instead.\n\nThey were progressing, which is to say they were not on fire and the underlaugh was breathing through its nose instead of its mouth, when Grin, who had been mute longer than was good for him, stepped on a patch of sand that remembered soldiers and spoke from the soles of his feet without meaning to. It was a clever little sound, the sort you could slip any number of meanings into, and the underlaugh, which loves a double meaning more than sin loves leisure, snapped toward it like a ferret. Kettle spun and threw a wet rag directly at Grin\u2019s face and the rag smacked him with all the dignity of a matron correcting a boy at table. He blinked, sputtered, and for once laughed at himself like a man and not a trick, and the underlaugh inched away, confused by an appetite turned inward that had not eaten anyone else.\n\n\u201cCarry that,\u201d Kettle said coolly, pointing at the rag, \u201cand if you open your mouth without my permission you put the rag in it first.\u201d\n\nGrin bowed, wet and chastened, and put the rag between his teeth and grimaced and made no effort at heroism. The heaths respected this, because they had mothers more exacting than weather. Candle put his hand flat on the sandy patch and apologised to the soldiers who used to turn here. Needle whispered a pun so bad it unmanned three patches of broom and made them drop their seed; Blot gulped a laugh and choked on it and then chose a better place to put it. Rill kept speaking yet into the places where he felt the word tip back toward end, balancing it, the way a person balances a tray of cups across a slanting deck.\n\nThey reached a hollow where gorse had already scorched itself months ago in a tantrum and cooled into charcoal that remembered everything. Kettle sat on a scar and set the bucket between her knees and talked to it about soup. The underlaugh curled there, resentful and comforted, like a story that had been told too many times and now wanted to be sung. Candle coaxed it with vowels he had borrowed from old chalk. Green George put a line around the hollow so the bad idea could not go visit the next one without stepping over a rope that would remind it of manners. Blot painted yet against the underside of a charred branch and the branch said, in the language of crack and patience, that it would try.\n\nRill\u2019s palms ached again, but it was not the ache of burning. It was the ache of carrying a basket too full of fruit because it is all ripe at once and you cannot bear to leave any of it on the ground where it will rot. He rubbed his thumbs together and in the friction felt the rope on his name hum in contentment. He thought of Poppy, of Harold, of Weller sliding back into her bed like a sigh, and of the stew they would eat when they had finished making sure laughter did not mistake itself for flame. He allowed himself, for a dangerous minute, to believe that this was what days were for.\n\nThen from the west, past the mouth that is not a mouth, under the cove that likes other people\u2019s hats more than is decent, the sea sent them a different shape of cold. It was tighter, metal-faced, of a sort that lives under schedules and whistles and blue uniforms. It smelled of oil and decision and a little of old paper stamped with approvals. The harbour had breathed in. The Twin Sails complained anew. The Patrol had looked down.\n\n\u201cThey are seeing more than they want,\u201d Needle said, snapping her head toward town as if she could unsee on their behalf. \u201cIf they see us, we will be a joke the present cannot forgive. If they do not see us, they will see something else and make a bad rule.\u201d\n\nKettle stood and picked up her bucket with a noise like a gavel in an agreeable court. \u201cWe finish here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe go home handsome. We teach the Patrol a no that is not a child\u2019s and not a door\u2019s. We give them yet, because bureaucracies love a postponement more than truth.\u201d\n\nGrin spat the rag into his hand with a wet slap, tucked it under his belt with a sense of theatre he did not squander, and looked at Rill with a face not even he could ruin. \u201cLet me speak,\u201d he asked, and Kettle drew breath to forbid him and he drew his wet rag out and stuffed it into his mouth again and mumbled through it, \u201cWith a mouth full of propriety.\u201d He plucked the bottle at his chest where yet waited without pride. \u201cI can sell delay to clocks.\u201d\n\nCandle considered and then inclined his head, granting permission as if he were the one who had it to give and thereby making it true. \u201cIf you can make the Patrol laugh in the right place,\u201d he warned, \u201cyou will have done a dangerous service. Mind your hinges.\u201d\n\nThey finished binding the underlaugh to a better appetite with the tidy finality of women closing up a pantry. The gorse looked less like it wanted to be a sermon and more like it wanted to be a hedge again. The broom lifted its lances with a sigh that sounded like gossip. The heaths let them go with the air of a house that has been put in order and can now afford to be messy in private. They took the path not because it was shortest but because it existed, which is sometimes the best reason. The wind had gone off to meddle elsewhere and the sun let them be seen in pieces on the sandy track, because no one minding their own business benefits from sharp outlines.\n\nWhen they reached the Jetty, the Patrol were there in their boat with the blue that says we mean to be helpful without being interested in your opinion. The craft rocked under men who were doing their jobs by leaning; their hands were on rails, on radios, on an authority that had been given to them by people who could not know the right sounds to make when chalk laughs. Their eyes were tired even when they were young. One of them had soup on his jacket and was embarrassed about it. The Twin Sails stood with its arms in their proper places, but there was a stiffness in its shoulder bolts like a person trying not to show you they had been crying recently.\n\nThe sergeant on the Patrol\u2019s bow, a woman with a mouth that could pry a misdeed out of a conger eel, saw Kettle and looked past her more than at her, which is how seeing works when you are not allowed to. \u201cYou lot,\u201d she said to the Jetty, to the ghosts, to the parts of the day that would later be written as wind. \u201cDid you feel that. We had reports. Cracks. Laughter in the foundations. A child with a torch. Don\u2019t tell me stories. Tell me where to put cones.\u201d\n\nRill stepped up because it was a work for hands and voices both and because his rope tugged lightly on his name and said you are the presentable one. Grin was behind him with the rag at the ready like penance. Kettle stood at his shoulder with a bucket and the unarguable expression of useful people. Needle bristled like a nettle that has just been asked to please be less itself. Candle took up a place in a patch of light and prepared to be ignored, which is the best place from which to alter the course of an afternoon.\n\n\u201cPut cones,\u201d Rill said pleasantly, \u201caround Weller\u2019s Channel at low tide because she is returning to good habits and will need encouragement to think of herself as a path. Put cones on the north end of the Twin Sails where someone has been throwing wishes too hard and the bridge\u2019s feelings were bruised. Put cones in your men\u2019s ears when they think to shout at children; make them ask nicely. And if you have cones spare, put them on the path up by the Old Copse until I have apologised to an oak and mended a fence. After that your cones may be redeployed to wherever you most like cones because we will have finished with them.\u201d\n\nThe sergeant stared, and the rope on Rill\u2019s name hummed power in a frequency that makes decision-makers think of retirement with fondness. It was not magic. It was tone. It was also a man with ink-scarred fingers standing attentively behind Rill, a man with a coil of lead line, a woman with a brazier, a needle-witch disguised as a child\u2019s toy, and a candle that was not lit because that would have been an admission. The sergeant\u2019s mouth twitched toward humour in the corner, as if a joke was trying to find its way up through her training and had decided to come back later. \u201cAnd you are,\u201d she said blandly, because names are tools and she had learned not to pick up what wasn\u2019t hers.\n\n\u201cA person,\u201d Kettle said briskly, saving everyone time, \u201cwho is telling you that if you put cones where I said you will not be mending things in a hurry tomorrow. If you do not put cones where I said, you will be mending more expensive things. Your choice is either competence or budget. I assume you prefer competence, because your jacket has soup on it and that means someone loves you at home.\u201d\n\nThe sergeant lifted a hand to her jacket and found the smear and looked the tiniest bit betrayed by fortune, then let the betrayal be an ally. She glanced at the bridge as if to ask it whether it had been misused, thought better, and looked back at the people who were politely not people. \u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cCones. Weller\u2019s. North end. Old Copse. Shouting at children is discouraged by the manual as well as decency. Consider it done.\u201d She paused, then added, in a lower tone that pretended to be an aside to the Jetty, \u201cAnd the laughing.\u201d\n\nGrin lifted the bottle of yet without flourish and handed it to Rill like a scalpel. Rill uncorked it with a thumb and held it near the sergeant\u2019s radio aerial. The word slid out like steam and sat on the metal with the weight of a promise. For a moment the radio did not crackle because radio knows when it has been given the equivalent of a biscuit and wants to behave in case there is another. \u201cIf the laugh comes back,\u201d Rill said, watching the sergeant as the word behaved, \u201csay yet three times in a line, not a list, with patience for the first reply. It will not stop it because we are not in the business of stopping laughter. It will make it turn its head and then you can set your cones where they will be useful. It will feel like nothing and it will be the difference between your men going home cross and going home cross and broken.\u201d\n\nThe sergeant\u2019s mouth did a thing only one person standing there noticed, because only Candle had the training to see a mouth agree while the rest of a face obeys protocol. She turned to her crew and spoke three orders in an economical tone that made the boat sit up and handle like a promise. When she turned back she had no humour left in her mouth because this was not where she would use it. She nodded to Kettle like two generals who had discovered they had the same mother, and then they were moving, competent, blue, the sort of necessary you are grateful for when you have to be.\n\n\u201cClocks,\u201d Grin said smugly through his rag, muffle wobbling the word until it became reasonable. Kettle removed the rag herself and put it back in his mouth so quickly he almost bit her, then blushed when he realised she had been faster than him out of love not malice.\n\nThey watched the Patrol lay down cones and embarrassment as if the two were the same colour and had to be distributed evenly. The ghosts under the Jetty swore with relief, which is the only time anyone should swear near soup. Poppy, from a window where she had been instructed to practise thinking about not walking at night, put her nose to the glass and watched competence pass like a boat. The weather, satisfied for the moment that it had some role to play that did not involve dragging anyone by the ankles out of their beds, stretched like a well-fed animal and promised to be interesting in the afternoon.\n\nThey went to the Old Copse again because oaks sulk when thanked by proxy. The grandmother accepted a second apology as if it had never been owed and then accepted the apology again because forgiveness is a habit that improves with repetition. Nettles lifted their proper flags along the fence and ran shivers up their stems to show off. Needle muttered a vicious pun into the wattle and the feathers that still clung there fell out in a sulk so delicious Rill laughed aloud and the oak did not scold him for it.\n\nBy the time they had all eaten what was left in Kettle\u2019s tin and Rill had catalogued the wishes stuck under the bridge with blue clay in neat ticks like a bookkeeper of the tide, the day had become ordinary in that deceptive way days have when they have been doing hazardous work and would now like to be mistaken for laundry. The rope on Rill\u2019s name had stopped humming and settled into a posture of domestic tyranny. Candle tucked Harold\u2019s flake deeper under the cloth on his nail and whispered something to it that sounded like joinery and prayer. Blot rubbed his fingers together until the ink stopped thinking it was more important than he was and had the grace to become merely stubborn. Green George sat on the edge of a crate and listened to the lead line remember depths with contentment, which is how you properly care for elder tools. Needle took stock of jokes and found she had three left that could be used on shrubs and two she would hold back for councils, which meant her day had been judicious. Grin leaned against a post and did not make an entrance or an exit, which may have been the cleverest thing he did all week.\n\nWhen evening came down like a clean sheet shaken over a bed, they went home in their separate directions because belonging is easier when it has corners. Rill walked the harbour once with his knuckles brushing the old rail so it could count him as a familiar and not an event. He marked the underside of the Twin Sails where his clay had been nicked by a coaxing laugh earlier, and the clay did not sigh because clay does not sigh, but the bridge settled a millimetre, which is better. He put a hand on the Jetty\u2019s beam where the light folds and thanked glass for listening, and it pricked his palm lightly by way of reply, which is the language of things that cannot speak and never lie.\n\nAt his bolt-hole over the drain that used to be a matter of civic contention and was now his back door, he sat with his feet in the water because he liked cold that told the truth. He took yet out of his pocket\u2014not the bottle because that properly lived in Grin\u2019s coat now\u2014but the taste of it, which had become his. He rolled it on his tongue as if he could tell by it whether tomorrow would require more of him than he had and if so whether his hands would do it anyway. The rope on his name warmed once. He smiled because there were mouths in the world, carved and otherwise, that would try to be clever tomorrow, and he had soup, and thread, and a child\u2019s no returned with thanks, and Old Harry\u2019s grudging sympathy, and a channel humming to itself in the bed it knew.\n\nThe laugh under the chalk slept, if that is what coils do when they do not think, and dreamed lacklustre, wholesome dreams. The heaths told themselves stories about not burning, which is a new genre and worth encouraging. The Patrol went home cross and not broken, and one of them wiped soup off a jacket with the corner of a towel and kissed a person who had made it. Poppy went to bed with all her walls in the right places and one window not quite closed because somewhere a gull had an opinion worth hearing at three in the morning. Grin lay on his back staring at a ceiling he did not deserve, with a rag on his chest and a bottle under his pillow, and tried very hard to fall asleep before he made a joke that would wake him up again by coming true. Kettle, needle on her lap, cooked tomorrow in her head, which is how you make days edible before they are born. Candle sat in the dark because it is where he keeps the parts of himself that need quiet, and he talked to chalk until chalk sighed and shut up.\n\nRill, small, salt, nettle, chance, closed his eyes. He did not ask for endings. He did not ask for beginnings. He asked for lines and for the good, plain thread to pull on when laughter, which is not the enemy, forgets that it is a bridge and not a blade. The harbour turned in its sleep and showed him its good side, and he catalogued that as well because you do not only write down bad days. He slept without blue clay under his head for the first time in two nights and dreamed of tying the horizon to a bucket with an anchor bend and being forgiven by nobody because nobody had been angry. The morning came as it always did, with a cough and a grin and the smell of someone else\u2019s toast, and he woke with both hands open, ready.Rill woke to the respectable noises of a harbour denying it had done anything dramatic in the night. The drain under his bolt-hole coughed contentedly and spat a fish scale with the air of a man clearing his throat before reading minutes. He lay for a moment with his palms upright, feeling for aches. The burns on his hands had settled to polite reminders, the rope around his name purred against his skin like a cat with opinions about the duvet, and the world, all vastness and errands, leaned amicably against his door. He did not so much stretch as unfurl; people made of knots did not stretch without untying something they might need later. He stood, rubbed sleep from the corners of his eyes with a forefinger he had promised not to lie with, and tasted the morning to see whether it had decided to be a list or a story. It tasted of toast, of wet slate, and of a red thread with manners clearing its throat.\n\nThe thread lifted itself from his wrist with the self-importance of a committee member who has discovered the biscuits and now wants to pass an important motion. It did not tighten, which was courteous. It merely inclined in the manner of a dog pointing, the way threads do when they are sure they can be trusted with a bit of agency and not ruin the carpet. Rill tilted his head and followed the gesture with his attention before he let his feet follow with boots. The Jetty was not calling, not precisely, and neither was the chalk. The tug lay upriver where the sea becomes a conversation with the Frome and the tides decide to be democratic with mud. The other end had found his name like a fish nose knows the difference between water that has been to London and water that has only heard rumours of it.\n\nKettle\u2019s knock on his door was not a knock so much as a competent arrangement of knuckles against wood. He opened at once because there is no point in making a kettle wait. She was already in her day, hair scandalised by the weather, apron pocket a riot of items that looked like kitchen implements and were in fact treaties. She thrust a mug into his hands that smelled like the underside of fog and pepper and considered him with the satisfaction of someone who has counted all the spoons and found none missing. \u201cThe thread?\u201d she asked, though the red had already curled itself against her wrist in greeting and given her a ceremonial tap like an invitation to a dance with footnotes. \u201cI felt it tug while my porridge was pretending not to be cross. Does it want our shoes or our ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wants our river,\u201d Rill said. He sipped her drink and felt it make itself at home in his ribs. \u201cThe inland end is sniffing at us. The Frome has a thought and it is treading water in a way that promises either news or trouble and I don\u2019t like leaving those two alone. The weir at Wareham is in the mood to count itself aloud. We should go before it starts asking the Patrol to help it find the name of a fish that has no truck with whistles.\u201d\n\nNeedle appeared like a remark you had been hoping no one would add and then discovered you had been saving a seat for. She looked like she had not slept, or like she had slept and stabbed the bed for snoring. She had twine around her wrist and pins in her hair and a scowl sharp enough to make a bottle rethink its label. \u201cIf we must go inland,\u201d she said with the offended contempt coastal sprites have for any mention of fields, \u201cI will come and correct everyone\u2019s nouns. Rivers think they are metaphors when they are simply badly organised roads. I will not have the Frome confusing end with bend. Also there is a rumour going about that a ladder for fish has become an escalator and is now charging. I cannot abide escalators.\u201d\n\nGrin arrived last because he had been practising not arriving at all, which is the sort of late that sometimes passes for improvement when you are keeping your expectations on a leash. He carried his wet rag folded over his arm like a churchgoer who intends to mind his hymn book. The bottle with yet slept in the pocket over his heart, which would have been symbolic if he had not known symbols personally and had therefore decided not to give them the satisfaction. \u201cGoing inland,\u201d he observed brightly, which earned him a look from Kettle that sanded the brightness off neatly. He put up his hands. \u201cI will be a tourist with my mouth full of propriety. I will point at cattle and refrain from puns. I will not fall in love with a bridge.\u201d He paused, then sighed because honesty had turned up at the table uninvited and claimed a chair. \u201cI might fall in love with a bridge.\u201d\n\nThey went sideways first because sideways is quicker until it isn\u2019t. The path through the hard edges of town to where the river made manners was stacked with laundry of light. The market men had their crates turned to show off the best oranges as if they had grown them under Poole\u2019s shy sun rather than bought them off a truck at an hour when good people refuse to know numbers. A woman mended nets with the unconscious elegance of someone who does things better when she does not think about being witnessed. The Patrol had set their cones exactly where Kettle had told them and somehow made it look like their idea, which is the sort of magic that keeps towns from collapsing at corners. Poppy, behind a dignified curtain twitch that could have signed its name, gave them a very solemn wave with the hand that had worn the clay and then went back to the important business of pretending to eat breakfast at a speed she would never achieve without bribery.\n\nBefore they left the harbour proper, Rill stopped under the Twin Sails and pressed his palm to the smear of clay he had placed the day before. It answered like a cat pressed against a shin, affronted and appeased in the same breath. He murmured names down into the seam because bridges like to be given their roll-call when they have been sick and survived. Kettle flicked a breadcrumb at a gull who had been thinking philosophical thoughts about chips and redirected it to more practical ambitions. Needle ran iron along the rail where the wrong laugh had scratched itself, sanding sound with sound. Grin watched without comment, his eyebrows writing seventeen jokes he would not say aloud because he was not that idiot this hour.\n\nThe river took them with its particular pulse, which is not sea and not stream but something stubborn in the middle. It moved like an elder who knows the shortcuts in town and resents anyone else taking them. The first reach past Holes Bay had a wide, placid pretence on top and a closed lip of current underneath. Barges lay on their sides in the mud as if practising fainting; a heron in scandalous grey stared at them with the long contempt of a professional. Rill put his hand on the gunwale and felt the Frome judging his grip. He did not squeeze back because rivers do not like to be told they are handshakes.\n\nAt the bend where Wareham shows its shoulders, the river began to talk about the mill with the self-importance of a person dealing with a neighbour. They could hear the wheel that no longer turned remembering itself and trying to drum its old rhythm into water that had learned to be less obedient and more interesting. The weir spoke in its own accent, a thin metal song hummed through the teeth of boards that had been measured by men with pencils and then ignored by water with time. Candle was waiting on the bank with his cap carefully neutral and his mouth set to the hymnal page that says you are allowed to speak and also to listen without quarrelling. He had arrived ahead of them because Candle always arrived ahead of them. He inclined his head and the weir scowled in a way that told you it was flattered.\n\nWareham\u2019s bridge, stone and self-consciously picturesque, held itself the way bridges do when they have been on postcards. It had grown very used to watching weddings go across it and did not intend to be part of an argument. On the far side, where the path kinks like a shame, a man in a high-visibility jacket stood with a clipboard and the face of someone who had been handed a set of measurements and a budget and was trying to reconcile them with a landscape that continually refused to fit its own outlines. He did not see sprites because he was not a child and because his list had not left room for that line. He saw suspicious swans instead and gave them a wide berth, which is a skill you should put on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 while swans still let you.\n\nThe weir\u2019s thought was tangled. It had collected driftwood ideas behind its teeth and the ideas had knotted. A fish ladder sat to the left like a polite afterthought and a piece of modern guilt, and it hummed to itself in bad lift music as tiny lives tried to make it a story about perseverance rather than the more accurate one about rude obstacles. Rill crouched on the stone lip, put a hand to the ladder, and felt in it the scratch of a joke someone had left, the sort of joke that uses stairs as a punchline and thinks itself superior. It made his fingers itch as if he had put them too near sugar. He did not bother to be offended at the wit; he had known sharper people than this and they had also mistaken themselves for edges. He looked to Kettle and she was already there with a tin mug and a scoop, decanting the river into a series of sips so it could taste itself and become less adamant.\n\n\u201cWho told you you were a wall,\u201d Kettle asked the weir briskly, which is how you talk to thresholds that have got above themselves. \u201cYou are a sieve with pretensions, darling. Most sieves I know are content. This behaviour is unbecoming. You are pinching the feet of eels and I will not have it. Drink your water and try again.\u201d\n\nThe weir pretended not to hear her and let out a little screech as a salmon with a grievance flung itself where water had been made square. The fish hit the lip and fell back with a noise like a polite swear. Needle made a face that could curdle milk. \u201cYou are not handsome enough to be cruel,\u201d she told the machinery. \u201cYour angles are not clever and your clatter is undignified. Accept your function before I unpick you one bar at a time and make you into fish forks.\u201d\n\nGrin, forbidden by every sensible rule from taking the front of the conversation, sat on a bollard that was minding its own business and took the rag from his mouth because he needed to breathe and not because he had decided to talk. The bottle under his coat rapped against his rib like a very small teacher. He held himself quiet by sheer novelty. Candle stepped up to the little hut where the lock-keeper\u2019s ghost kept his cap and his cigarettes and touched the old bell that used to be rung when rope needed to be respected. He did it gently and with faith and the bell responded with a dull acknowledgement, like a person getting out of their chair when you call them for tea but not before the news finishes.\n\nFrom the reed bed to the right someone coughed with tiny lungs and then swore in a whisper. Nix stepped into view up to her knees in water with a bucket hooked over her arm, hair wet down the back in a line a less kind person would call untidy and which she called a style. \u201cThe ladder is sulking,\u201d she announced, which was apparent, \u201cand the volunteers have been making speeches at it, which is poison. I told them ladders like compliments and oil, one only of which you have to pay VAT on, and they smiled patronisingly and left. I put oil. It likes me. I need somebody with a better joke than stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cEscalator,\u201d Needle said immediately with the relish of a proper misanthrope. \u201cTell it an escalator is only a lie that has accepted a handrail. Tell it stairs need no moving parts to do their essential work. Tell it we will install a small sign that says Mind The Step and people will obey because they like being told what they already know as if it were news.\u201d\n\nKettle snorted, which is how she applauded. Rill set his palms flat on the ladder\u2019s lip and let the wrong joke slide into his fingers. It was a stale old thing about rising up in the world that had petrified into entitlement. He folded it as if folding a napkin and pressed Poppy\u2019s no, the practical polite version that fits in domestic corners, against it. Jokes, when you make them stop being clever, become heavy. He let this one sink onto the stone beside him where it could be swept later into a bin. He then told the ladder a very small joke about an eel in a lift that could not press the buttons and had to ask politely. The ladder, which had never been asked for anything but compliance, gurgled despite itself. It had a taste for please and thank you when the vowels were used competently. The water on the steps changed its mind about whether it preferred to sulk on the lip or run along the edge and chose the latter. The salmon, suspicious but opportunistic, flicked its tail and went up without telling anyone because secrecy is how some victories are. Three eels looked at one another like conspirators and slithered with the exhausted determination that makes you respect eels even when they run charitably afoul of your socks.\n\nThe weir itself offered the long complaint of an old man watching young men carry bricks wrong. Candle murmured acknowledgements that did not fix any of it and nonetheless made it less painful. Green George, who had arrived with the displeased cheer of a man who knows how much rope it will be his job to carry later, leaned over the rail and knocked gently on a plank that had been mis-nailed as a statement. \u201cWe will persuade you to be decent,\u201d he told the weir, eyes narrowed with patient intent, \u201cand you will pretend not to enjoy it so you can tell your friends we bullied you. We will all know the truth but lie as a favour because pride is a child and needs fruit cut up for it in a bowl sometimes.\u201d\n\nThe lock-keeper\u2019s ghost made his presence explicit at last simply by being sufficiently felt. He was a man of fifty-three infinitely because he had died doing a job that required fifty-three forever. He had a cap that was now a thought about a cap and a pencil behind an ear that had been chipped by wind in 1978. His voice came out the way tea tastes when it has been brewed in a pot that has seen more wars than weddings. \u201cThe Board wrote me a letter,\u201d he muttered without preamble. \u201cThey said the new funding was for safety, and then they took the ladder out for six weeks and left me with a bin bag and courage. I do not mind work. I mind doing the work wrong. That thing down there thinks it knows everything. It does not. Its ideas go sideways into mud and frighten the fry.\u201d\n\nRill tipped his head respectfully and put his hand out, palm up. The ghost put nothing into it because that is not how the living and the dead exchange anything of use, and yet Rill felt a little weight like a key only real if you wanted to open a door that believed in you. He closed his fingers because you do that when a person gives you their name in any form. \u201cWe are not the Board,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the Keepers. Not of yours particularly. Of two ends, which is already more than we ought, and is manageable only because we have Kettle and she has soup. We won\u2019t take your ladder. We\u2019ll put a joke on it you can use when they come with clipboards. It will sound like compliance and taste like stubbornness and be nutritious in an emergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompliance,\u201d Needle said with disgust so crisp you could sprinkle it over chips, \u201cis a word that has learned to be both polite and vengeful. I like it on ladders better than on tongues.\u201d\n\nThe river had opinions and did not pretend not to. It slid its weight against the weir with a deliberate patience that made the structure consider the possibility that it had always intended to be porous. Rill shaped a knot in the air, not on water because that is a nuisance, and cast it very lightly across the top of the weir\u2019s idea. He did not tie the river\u2014no one ties a river without losing a footnote later\u2014but he set the knot out where fish could catch it with their eyebrows if they lacked better plans. Fish have more eyebrows than people think, they simply keep them internal for privacy. He whispered yet into the wood where the water paused, and the pause became a turn, which is what you want in rivers and in arguments with your older aunts.\n\nThe man in high-visibility with the clipboard, whose name was perhaps Simon or possibly Declan depending on the day and who had an older sister who had rescued him from ponds by his ear, looked down and saw the ladder begin to behave and felt it as relief in his shoulders. He did not see any sprites and he would not remember to tell the Board that sometimes water finds its own engineer, but he would go home with soup on his jacket if he was lucky and a story about making progress if he was less so. He turned, made a note he did not fully understand in a box that had asked for numbers and had received adjectives. The ghost of the lock-keeper watched him with the forgiving scorn of a man who had once been young enough to be wrong to the proper scale.\n\nWareham\u2019s bridge listened to itself being admired without congratulating itself. Candle leaned his shoulder against the old stone and shared weather. Kettle, who had run out of reasons to be angry for ten minutes, cleaned the lip of the ladder with a rag that had been mood and was now a tool. Needle collected three more appalling escalator jokes and labelled them with disgust because you must always keep a store of the weapons you refuse to use for the times when shrubs insist. Grin, whose abstinence had begun to make his tongue itch, let a small, harmless play on current die unspoken and felt the bottle under his heart warm as if someone had nodded to him in another room and he had decided to be flattered by the nod and not the room.\n\n\u201cUpstream,\u201d the red thread insisted, nudging Rill\u2019s wrist again, not rude but obstinate. The Frome had let them fix a lip and now wanted them to meet a new tooth. There was a pinch in the water beyond the bridge where a back eddy had stored something sharp and would not admit it was hoarding. It tasted of iron and a promise written on paper you were not supposed to lick. Rill made a face, tasted again, and recognised the signature of an old thing that did not think it was old because it dressed itself in the latest phrasing. The river had acquired a regulation.\n\nGreen George swore under his breath in a nautical that had kept boats afloat for a century. \u201cSomebody has put a net across her in the wrong place,\u201d he said without needing to see it, because men who have cast without hurting fish can smell arrogance in braided cord. \u201cNot a real net. A rule. It\u2019ll have floats. It\u2019ll catch words before it catches water. We had one in \u201886 and we taught it to become rope for a wash line. That was a good day.\u201d\n\nThey went up and found it at a meander section where the Frome allowed herself the luxury of dignity. Two new posts had been driven, bleached within an inch of what wood likes, and between them someone had strung a bright blue line festooned with triangles of plastic that flapped in the keen with the arrogant democracy of festivals. The pennants read Keep Out in a font that assumed you were already ashamed. They had not been placed to keep anyone from drowning. They had been placed to keep the river from being river in that particular place. The water had kinked to accommodate them, which is what water does when it needs to and shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nKettle put her hands on her hips in a way that said good morning to the fight and cracked her neck like a woman preparing to lift insult out of a room. Needle sniffed as if someone had put marmalade in the tea. Candle looked at the posts with tender eyes and addressed them as boys who had fallen in with the wrong crowd. Blot, appearing from the reed with a ledger the damp had not dared to warp, made a note that looked like a drawing of a man with a hat on backwards. Green George tested the line with a thumb and a sigh. Grin made the face he made when he liked a toy he wasn\u2019t allowed. Rill set his palms on the air where two words had glued themselves and felt the glue\u2019s cheapness. He put his ear to a triangle and heard, behind the Keep Out, another phrase the maker had not intended to use. It said End Of.\n\n\u201cEnd of what,\u201d Needle demanded of the triangles with the fury of a librarian dragged into a meme. \u201cEnd of sentence? End of laugh? End of a budget line? End of patience? Do you intend to end a river and if so have you informed the fish or do you plan to leave a voicemail.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnd of a paddle lease,\u201d the ghost of the lock-keeper offered unhelpfully, and then added with relish, \u201cEwan in licensing is in love with triangles. He likes to see them flutter. He thinks it adds tone. He is allergic to mud. He once called a sluice gate a crop. I will haunt him, but first I will make him a cup of tea because I was his father\u2019s friend and he is not irredeemable, merely flammable.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep Out,\u201d Kettle read, and her mouth did something that could have grown into a grin in another kitchen and became instead a plan. \u201cAll right. We will keep out. We will keep out what should be kept out. We will keep out the laugh and the end and the arrogance and we will fling them into a ditch to sulk. The rest can come through as it needs. We will repurpose signage with courtesy.\u201d\n\nRill took hold of the red thread and invited it to tighten, just this once. It did, delighted to be acknowledged, and put its teeth into his pulse with an enthusiasm that made him forgive it. He anchored it with the rope on his name so it would not run away with him and set his hands to the blue line. He did not cut it. He had no wish to fight a municipal resentment and he respected the person who had carried posts to a river and done their job badly while meaning well. He slid the Keep between his fingers and set it to one side. The Out he rewrote by moving three letters in his palm and asking Blot to dab the ink where it would stay without making a boast of it. When he let go the triangles now read Keep Flow, which was a suggestion and not an order and thus possible. The posts did not notice themselves improved; posts do not have that sort of vanity. They stood where they had been pounded with diligence and the river passed them consenting to be itself.\n\nGrin allowed himself a very small sound that was as close to pride as he had earned. He was not proud of the change. He was proud of his not being the change and being present. This is a skill you learn late and then pretend you always had. The river put its shoulder into the bend again and the back eddy that had been hoarding the smell of pennies moved out into the honest middle and lost its attraction for mischief. Eels ghosted past the revised triangles with a sardonic wiggle and resolved to write to their cousins in two tides\u2019 time about think pieces.\n\nBy the time they came back down under Wareham\u2019s postcard life, the weir had decided to be a sieve and was feeling very superior about it in private. The ladder sang a little actual tune instead of its unreasonable hum. A boy in a red jacket not unlike Poppy\u2019s but shaped for a longer spine leaned on the rail and did not see anything except the satisfaction of moving water because he was borderline in love with physics. Rill stored that face because it is the sort of sight you use later when you need to remind yourself that the future has foolishness of the right kinds in it.\n\nThey took their leave by touching things. Candle put two fingers on the bell because it liked to feel dignified. Kettle dipped her rag and wrung it out with an efficiency that made the lock-keeper\u2019s ghost sigh with admiration and envy. Needle slid her iron across a nail that had been bent and made it straight again with such precision she almost smiled. Green George untwisted a kink from the lead line with a frown that was his private religion. Blot capped his bottle with a noise that meant work completed. Grin put the rag back in his mouth briefly for the sheer ritual of it, then took it out again and tucked it away with care because habit can become liturgy when not observed with malice. Rill pressed his left hand, the liar, into the river just past the weir and then his right, the knotter, and felt both accepted because he had not asked them to be other than they were.\n\nAfternoon was waiting at the harbour with a hand on its hip. The Jetty listened to their return with the grace of a friend who has been minding your cat and was not judged for loving it outrageously. Elder Thatch\u2019s beard had collected small weather. Green George\u2019s coil had, miraculously, not collected any emergencies during their absence and was smug. Poppy sat on Thatch\u2019s crate with a book open and her finger very carefully under each word as if she could lasso them into being slower, and her mother looked a little less like a gate across a doorway and a little more like the person who makes the stew and does not require eternal heroism for it.\n\n\u201cYou look like people who have argued with planks and won,\u201d Thatch observed with the courtly contempt of old men who needed to feel useful and had decided feeling clever was a workable substitute. \u201cDid you fetch the river to heel or did it inform you politely that it would be doing as it liked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe showed it a better joke,\u201d Kettle said. \u201cIt agreed to be funny in the direction of usefulness. The weir has been prevented from making stairs a political act. Needle bullied an escalator. Rill told a sign to mind its prepositions. Grin did nothing objectionable in public and then refrained from boasting about it. Candle made friends with metal. Blot abused ink for the common good. Green George measured decency. We will all now eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one believes me when I tell them resolution has the taste of pepper,\u201d Thatch complained to the Jetty at large, but he reached for a bowl like a man with sense. Rill sat, hands a little shocked at being asked to do nothing, and let soup become his afternoon. The rope around his name warmed once, an acknowledgement without orders. The red thread patted his wrist and lay down with its nose on its paws because even threads have the sense to nap in good company.\n\nIt might have been an ordinary ending to a useful day if the glass had not hiccuped. It was not the wrong laugh; it was a ripple, a refractive twitch along the underside of the Jetty, like a fish showing a side of itself you do not see unless it wants you to. Candle turned his head and so did the lock-keeper\u2019s ghost who had walked with them as far as the post and then become again the man who minds the bell and remembers names. The ripple became a picture for an instant, and for that instant the Jetty was not a Jetty but a window someone had not thought to shut in France or Ireland or the other side of a coincidence. Rill saw, he could not help it, a quay that was not their quay, a harbour mouth with shoulders cut more severely, and a set of sails that were not twin but triple, and a woman with a badge that read Port Authority and a face that had been loved badly by a job once and then decided to do it anyway. She looked down at the water and said something to someone Rill could not see, and the glass closed its polite throat and became theirs again.\n\nGreen George rubbed the bridge of his nose with a finger that had once been broken and was now his favourite weather vane. \u201cThe glass has decided to be a letterbox,\u201d he said, not disapproving. \u201cOther harbours have been bitten and now they are writing. The Council of Estuaries will fancy a conference. They\u2019ll arrive with rules in their hats and the wrong shoes.\u201d\n\nThatch fixed his beard as if it were a sail needing a tug. \u201cWhen harbours recommend one another,\u201d he mused, \u201cthe world is either ending or getting bigger. We will need an agenda and biscuits and a list of what words we will not tolerate. I vote against unprecedented, which is a lazy boast in a parade uniform.\u201d\n\nRill felt the rope on his name change key. Not a pull, not a pinch; a chord. The two ends had spoken to each other through his spine and done it without his permission with the affectionate rudeness of old relatives. He felt a brief, untoward joy bloom in his throat because he had been made a conduit and had not broken. He looked at Kettle and she looked back at him with a ladle already poised, which is what passes for comfort in his world. \u201cWe are going to need rooms,\u201d he said, and it felt like the first talk of a wedding and a court case simultaneously. \u201cAnd chairs that do not splinter when a smug person leans on the wrong bit. And invitations to people we do not like who nonetheless are responsible for useful things in places we do not know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a plan for Grin,\u201d Needle added with relish, as if ordering dessert. \u201cHe will want to host and I will want to stab. We will need to compromise. Perhaps he can host the restroom.\u201d\n\nGrin put a hand over his heart as if she had shot him there and then remembered that was where the bottle lived, and he removed it carefully and let his hand hover in apology over his chest. He managed seriousness with an effort that would have made a better man proud and him simply tired. \u201cI will write the programme,\u201d he offered, almost meek. \u201cI will print yet in the margins where no one expects useful things and will encourage breaks for soup. I will stand at the door and make people laugh where they should not and be embarrassed where they must. And when a person stands to make an ending a spectacle I will sit down in front of them and chew my rag.\u201d\n\nKettle looked at him long and then nodded once. She had not forgiven him and would not start a habit of it in public. She had given him a job because idleness is how disasters crouch. Candle rolled his shoulders and let the Jetty\u2019s light take the good side of his face as if to say, very well then, we will allow the day one more thing before we allow bed to happen. Blot snapped his ledger shut with a noise like a promise. Green George went to find more rope because conferences liked to unravel. Thatch sat back on his crate and began composing in his head the opening speech for an assembly of tide, something without adjectives and with three good nouns you could nail planks to.\n\nPoppy looked up from her book because the grown-up weather had changed. She slid off the crate with the practised stealth of a child and came to stand beside Rill. She put her hand on his rope without being told and without asking because some permissions live in the fibres of certain afternoons. It warmed under her palm, and Rill for one beat of his heart did not think of ends or cracks or weirs or chalk. He thought of chairs. He thought of biscuits. He thought of a harbour that had decided to remember itself aloud across languages and distances and the tender arrogance of tides. He let himself imagine he would be the person in the room who would say yet when endings stood up and introduced themselves with their hobbies and their CVs. He let himself imagine that would sometimes be enough.\n\nEvening sloped in not so much later as kindly. They made lists on the Jetty: who would come because they were asked, who would come because they were not and could not help themselves, who would need to be lured with respect and who with an opportunity to have their hair admired. Letters would be written to the Solent and the Exe, to the Mersey if she would lower herself to correspond with the south, to harbours not made of stone at all but of mangrove and memory because they were thinking of inviting the whole world and needed to be stopped. Candle drafted words for stone to read. Blot drafted words for people. Needle drafted rules for jokes. Green George drafted a list of knots you should never attempt to tie in public unless you wanted lawsuits. Kettle drafted a menu that involved soups from seven counties and bread that would not disgrace any of them.\n\nThey worked until lamps had to be lit and then worked so that lamps did not have to be lit after that because the glass does not like open flame when it is being a window to other people\u2019s foolishness. Rill took a breath that counted as selfish and set it in his pocket for later. He would go, after this, to the grandmother oak for seven minutes with a cake he had no right to because it had been baked for someone else and gently stolen by a person with moral mathematics. He would tell the oak that the world was coming in pieces to their Jetty and not to worry, the chairs would be set properly and no one would put their hands on her bark without being taught how to by Kettle. He would touch the weir again in a day and tell it the fish had been seen to pass without filing a complaint. He would stand on the cliff and ask Harold if he wanted a new joke to roll under his tongue when the wind was wrong.\n\nWhen he finally let his feet turn toward the drain that was his front garden and his back door, he felt the rope thrum a second time at his name with an almost shy little pride. The Two Ends had met behind his back and decided to throw a party on his Jetty. He had the urge to laugh and did not because he had lately learned restraint around such urges and because laughter carried is sometimes better than laughter spilled. He saved it for the morning when there would be biscuits and pamphlets and at least one serious person mispronouncing Old Harry, and he would need to be a bridge no one noticed crossing until they were on the other side. He saved it because you do not spend all your joy on planning. Some of it must be left for the part where someone stands up with an ending like a hat and you hook it, kindly, by the brim, and hang it on a peg where it can be admired without being worn.",

                              "content": "Rill of Poole had learned to read the tides like a locksmith learns the mouths of keys. He stood on a creaking plank under the old Twin Sails bridge, where the cables hummed faintly, where barnacles made hieroglyphs of the pilings. The evening had turned the harbour to pewter. The swell lifted the eelgrass in the shallows, and each glimmer on the water was a small, quick heartbeat. Rill felt them against his calves, the pulse and pull; he could count time on his ankles. He was a sprite, which meant he was not much taller than a good-luck charm, made of salt and nettle and chance, but he weighed more than you\u2019d think when he chose to.\n\nHe had a number of skills, a particular set that was not common even in Poole\u2019s hidden corners: he could untie the unsaid from a knot; he could hear a map sing of its edges; he could reach into a bottle for the last word after the last word was gone. He\u2019d learned those things from water and rope and the patient persistence of gulls that never quit. He used them now, standing on the lip of a rusty chain-link drain, his toes gripping a loop of it like a sparrow\u2019s claws, eyes closed. The lost phrase was caught somewhere near, tangled in the green cords and the hair-thin threads of spider-silk that had caught the dust of many summers.\n\n\u201cStop dithering,\u201d Kettle said from behind him. Her voice was soft because everything about Kettle was soft: her hair like moss, her hands like mittens. She kept a folding brazier on her back and made the best oysters-with-pepper of any sprite in the southern harbours. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting, Rill.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can wait,\u201d Rill said without opening his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s waited for four days; he can wait for three breaths more. The word slid down the drain mouth, and it\u2019s hiding in a knot of slime. If I yank, I\u2019ll lose the tail of it.\u201d\n\nKettle clacked the brazier lightly as if offended on behalf of the man above them. \u201cI know you have\u2026 skills.\u201d She had a way of saying the word as if it\u2019d been borrowed and might need to be returned with a bow. \u201cBut the Harbour Patrol\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look down,\u201d Rill said. He reached into the drain with his left hand, not his right, because the right was good for knots but the left was good for lies, and the last word of a dying man to his battered boat was a bit of both. He felt the cold-slick of the metal rim, the furry damp, the notch on his index finger where a mussel had once bitten him. Then he made a hook of his thumb and fished with it, found a snag, and teased.\n\nThe phrase came up as a thin ribbon, translucent, splashed with bits of grit. He had it in his palm. It tried to flutter away, to get back to the drain\u2019s silted inner. He cupped it with a wind that didn\u2019t exist and whispered the bottle\u2019s name in its ear, then fed it into the brown glass waiting by his ankle. The bottle had been rubbed with fish scales to quiet it and lined with a spider\u2019s exhale to keep it supple.\n\n\u201cSay it then,\u201d Kettle urged, curious. She always was curious about gleanings, about the small salvage that kept them fed and favoured.\n\nRill shook his head. \u201cThose are only for the one that said them or the one that needs them. We just wrangle.\u201d\n\nAbove them, on the bridge\u2019s walkway, a fisherman with eyes as red as the sun\u2019s last sting leaned on the rail. Kettle took the bottle, scrambled up a ladder that only sprites could grip, and pressed it into the man\u2019s big human hand. He cried then; Rill could hear the salt change in the air.\n\nHe let the plank hold him a breath longer and then turned, flipping upside down to mark the underside of the bridge with a small seam of blue clay. It was his way of saying, \u201cDone.\u201d It was a habit. It was also a ward. There were so many wishes tossed down to the water; the water needed help cataloguing.\n\n\u201cThree more of those tomorrow,\u201d Kettle said as Rill came up to join her on the walkway. She nodded toward the quay lights, toward the ferries at their berths, toward the gulls that had learned the timetables. \u201cGreen George says there\u2019s a red thread around your name; says the Assembly will want your ear. Ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cThreads don\u2019t belong around names.\u201d Rill straightened, flexed his shoulder. He was wiry and quick and had hands like he\u2019d been born from the pockets of a thief, which in a way wasn\u2019t wrong. He looked past Kettle to the crescent of the harbour, to Brownsea\u2019s dark hulk on the horizon, to the lighthouse that winked steady as a heartbeat. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not wrong, wrong. It\u2019s\u2026 something,\u201d Kettle said. \u201cA disturbance. Someone\u2019s turned the benches in the Old Copse upside down and left goose-feathers jammed in the wattle. And there are dead nettles, Rill.\u201d She shivered. \u201cDead nettles, in August. Who does that?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn idiot,\u201d Rill said lightly. But his neck hairs bristled. Dead nettles were as pointed as exclamation marks, and sprites didn\u2019t like punctuation much. Punctuation meant decisions.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2026 telling jokes,\u201d Kettle said as if the words had grit in them. \u201cAn inappropriate sprite.\u201d\n\nRill thought of the last time he\u2019d heard the name. Grin. He turned it in his mouth as if it were a stick he could taste the fire from, testing the burn. \u201cHe\u2019s back in Poole?\u201d\n\nKettle rolled her eyes skyward. \u201cHe never left, if you ask me. He just hides between syllables. He was in the cress beds last week, telling bad jokes to the crabs. Made them pinch their own legs. Nix says a boy broke his arm falling off the quay because of a quip about wings. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be funny,\u2019 he said, then it was.\u201d\n\nRill rubbed his knuckle against his lip, a habit when he was thinking. Grin told jokes that were wrong in the particular way that made water roll back from your ankles. They weren\u2019t filthy, not in that way, not exactly, but they were like saying \u201cfire\u201d in a quiet library or \u201cquiet\u201d in a burning room. Inappropriate was the word for them, except that made them sound small. They were levers. And Grin liked to pry.\n\n\u201cWho told him he was funny,\u201d Rill murmured.\n\n\u201cEveryone,\u201d Kettle said, and the word had a certain bitterness). \u201cEveryone laughs. They can\u2019t help it. He makes it so the laugh comes first and the sense comes later, and by the time the sense arrives, the joke\u2019s already lodged like a fishbone.\u201d\n\nRill looked at his left palm, where there was still a faint shimmer from the word he\u2019d caught. He flexed his fingers. \u201cAnd the Assembly wants me because\u2014?\u201d\n\nKettle made a see-saw with her hand. \u201cYour\u2026 capabilities. The way knots behave when you talk to them. The way you can find the end of a thing even when it\u2019s been chewed off.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine.\u201d Rill turned down the quay. \u201cBut first I want to\u2026 I want to see the Old Copse.\u201d\n\nThey ghosted along the fringe of the quay where the shadows were thickest and the voices from the pubs were like a chorus of tailors tearing cloth. Rill kept his eyes on the ground, listening for nails in the wood, for the tired crack of a rail that had been leaned on too much by grief or joy. He used those small noises to memorize. Kettle kept pace, her brazier clinking. Somewhere a foghorn sighed as if the night had stepped on a cat.\n\nThe Old Copse was a wedge of trees that had grown up in the lee of the embankment where the railway once slept. Sprites liked it because the roots made rooms, because the ivy was a good listener. Rill slipped into the green hush and found the benches upside down just as Kettle had said. The goose-feathers were jammed in the wattle fence at odd angles, like halfway thoughts. Where the nettles should have been he found pale stalks, bleached and curled, wearing their deaths openly.\n\nAnd someone had carved a mouth into the bark of the grandmother oak. It wasn\u2019t a mouth, exactly, more like a notch that resembled one, but if you stood at a certain angle and squinted, it was a grin. Below it, someone had written: \u201cWhy do islands never get lost? Because they\u2019re never better at sea.\u201d\n\nKettle snorted despite herself. Then she clamped both hands over her mouth and stamped her foot. \u201cNo. No. That\u2019s rotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad joke. That\u2019s the point,\u201d Rill said. \u201cHe\u2019s staking claims.\u201d He stepped closer to the oak and put his hand on the grin to feel if any heat lived in the cut. It was cold; the cold of something that wanted to be warmer.\n\nA flicker in the underbrush. Rill stilled. Kettle stilled. The flicker became a shape: long-ish, slended as a reed, hair like a shock of milkweed fluff, grin too wide for his small face. He came out into the moonlight and bowed in an exaggerated billow as if he\u2019d been on stage and the applause had just stopped.\n\n\u201cHello Poole,\u201d he said to the air, to the ground, to the tree, to Rill only at the last. \u201cDon\u2019t step on anyone\u2019s shadow. They\u2019re fragile this season.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrin,\u201d Kettle said flat. \u201cWe were just\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAdmiring my horticulture,\u201d Grin finished, waggling his eyebrows. \u201cOr, as I like to call it, horti-cackle-ture.\u201d He let the words hang and watched their shadows as if they were birds. \u201cYou like the dead nettles? It\u2019s a joke. See? Dead nettles are not dead. But they are called dead. So if I make them dead-dead, are they\u2026 more alive? No? All right. Tough crowd.\u201d\n\nRill kept his palm on the tree. He wanted to keep the bark between them as long as he could. Grin\u2019s smile wasn\u2019t always a weapon. Sometimes it was just a smile. But he used it to mark territory, and territory, in a place like Poole, meant old promises.\n\n\u201cLet the nettles be nettles,\u201d Rill said, no heat in his tone. \u201cThe Assembly won\u2019t like your\u2026 experiments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Assembly,\u201d Grin said, mouthing the syllables like fruit he\u2019d been given as a child. \u201cSo many elders packed into one word you\u2019d think it would burst, wouldn\u2019t you? But no. It hangs together anyway. Fascinating. Like a knot. Like your head.\u201d He pointed at Rill\u2019s temple as if aiming a stick there. \u201cYou tie things up and then you say you\u2019re freeing them. And everyone claps, clap-clap. Is that a skill or just habit?\u201d\n\nRill took his hand off the tree and put them both in his pockets for lack of anything better to do with them. He watched Grin\u2019s eyes. They were bright with the lights of the harbour and something else. \u201cYou went to school in mischief and graduated in hazard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s almost poetry. Careful.\u201d Grin stepped closer until he was at the edge of Kettle\u2019s brazier\u2019s glow. \u201cAll right then. Let\u2019s stop pretending I\u2019m not here for a reason. I\u2019m here for a reason. There\u2019s a crack in the world the size of a string, and I\u2019d like to fit a joke through it. Maybe two if I\u2019m feeling bold. You know how doors work; I know how rooms sound when you shout.\u201d\n\nKettle made a small noise in her throat and bit her lip until it went pale. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n\nRill said nothing. He watched a woodlouse amble over a stone by Grin\u2019s shoe, watched it decide the shade was better and turn back. He wondered what a crack in the world would feel like in his hands. Like a fish he couldn\u2019t quite bring up? Like the last word he\u2019d caught today? Eventually he said, \u201cJokes are not bridges.\u201d\n\nGrin laughed. It sounded, trivial, almost, but the ivy rustled when it shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cAren\u2019t they?\u201d he said. \u201cJoke: two shores, a sentence, a leap. We laugh in the air. You land, if you\u2019re lucky. If not, well. Splash.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease go away,\u201d Kettle said, and it wasn\u2019t a pleading sort of plea; it was a making-room-with-her-breath kind. She was one of the few who could look at a dangerous thing and not blink.\n\nGrin made a face as if he\u2019d tasted a lemon. \u201cSuch hospitality. I\u2019ll go then. Not because I was told. But because I have places to be and people to disappoint.\u201d He pivoted on his heel. \u201cRill of Poole,\u201d he said over his shoulder, \u201cyou have\u2026 useful fingers. Sometime soon I will ask you to pick a lock for me. You will say no. And then you will say yes. It\u2019ll be hilarious. Horribly.\u201d\n\nThen he slid into the ivy and was gone, as if he\u2019d made a mouth in the leaves to swallow himself.\n\nKettle exhaled into her hands. Rill looked at the notch he\u2019d carved in the underside of the bridge earlier today in his mind and wished it were here for him to mark. \u201cHe\u2019s worse,\u201d Kettle said. \u201cHe\u2019s sharper.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to smooth him,\u201d Rill said, thinking of wind and water. \u201cHe rubs against everything and gets more cutting.\u201d\n\nThe Assembly met under the Jetty of Glass when they needed to speak without wind. That place, the Jetty, had been a row of moorings once, which a storm had shivered and the shards of it had been stacked, then the light had learned to fold itself there. Sprites liked the Jetty because it reminded them the world was made of many pieces and would be, even if they wanted it to be a clean stripe. Rill and Kettle went by the back way under the salt-arches where the ghosts of fishermen\u2019s curses lived. They found Elder Thatch on a crate, his beard full of knots like a map.\n\n\u201cRill,\u201d he said, fogging his own name. \u201cWe have need of you. Brownsea\u2019s north grove has a\u2026 shard. A shard-of-ebbing. A key. It should be here.\u201d He held out a string in his hand. It had three knots. It had been broken.\n\n\u201cDear salt,\u201d Kettle murmured. \u201cWho tugged that?\u201d\n\nThatch made a face at the knots as though he could scold them back. \u201cWe did not. We guard. But the squirrel people stopped coming two months ago, and the badgers sleep a cold sleep, and the nights there are loud with something unsaid. We went to see. We did not go further when the ground hummed. Rill. You go. This is what you are for.\u201d\n\nRill took the string in both hands. It told him nothing. The missing tail gave away everything. He let it slide over his fingers, felt each knot\u2019s old stories chafing: an oath, a debt, a floor swept with leaves. \u201cWhy me,\u201d he said quietly, although he knew. Doors and lines and whatnot. Particulars.\n\nElder Thatch shrugged, a suggestion of a wave under that coat. \u201cBecause you can pull the end without unmaking the beginning, and we are old and clumsy and loud. Because you look at a knot and see the breath left in it. Because he will be there making noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrin,\u201d Kettle said. She tried saying it the way you might say a small misstep, a stubbed toe. It still came out like the edge of a blade.\n\n\u201cIf a thing can be ruined by laughter,\u201d Elder Thatch said, and his eyes went to the broken string in his hand, \u201cit\u2019s not worth keeping.\u201d It sounded brave. It sounded like something someone had told him. He looked suddenly very tired. \u201cBut some things are worth keeping and can stand being laughed at if the laughter is the right sort. Grin\u2019s sort is\u2026 no. Will you go.\u201d\n\nRill rubbed his lips. He had the taste of brine and old sodden rope on his tongue. He saw again the man with the bottle, the way his shoulders had dropped when he\u2019d set his ear to the glass. He thought of the grandmother oak with a mouth cut into her. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd\u2026 if I go, Kettle comes. And Needle if she\u2019ll have it.\u201d\n\nKettle arched an eyebrow at him. \u201cI always come.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot always,\u201d Rill said. But she did now. She made a face at him that said shut up and also that she would punch anyone who said she couldn\u2019t.\n\nNeedle arrived by accident, as she always did, sidling from a coil of rope with a bit of iron spit between her teeth. Needle was small even for a sprite and sharp in every way a word could be sharp: witty, angular, piercing. She adjusted her thimble hat. \u201cDid someone mention my name with intent,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause that has legal ramifications.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to Brownsea,\u201d Rill said. \u201cThere\u2019s a shard that hums and a door that needs fingers. And there\u2019s someone who will be there. With a mouth.\u201d\n\nNeedle\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cYou debt me four oyster shells from last week, Rill. This will make us even.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we not dead in a ditch of doom yet,\u201d Kettle said, mock-cheery. \u201cLet\u2019s go before we are.\u201d\n\nThe night gave them a boat because Rill asked for it correctly. He ran his palm down the side of a rotting skiff and told it a story about being young. The skiff blushed under the barnacles and remembered it had once been lighter. It lit them across the harbour like a skip-stone. The water tasted silver. Rill leaned over and touched it sometimes, to say thank you in the only language the sea never tired of, which is to say, touch.\n\n\u201cDid you hear about the lamplighter,\u201d Needle said after a while, as the skiff skated past a patch of dark water. \u201cWho lit a lamp at dawn and everyone said, \u2018Fool,\u2019 and the lamp said, \u2018You only ever talk to him when he lights you at night. You never ask me how I feel.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKettle groaned. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Needle said defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice joke. It comforts the lamp.\u201d\n\nRill smiled, small. It did. There were jokes like that. Houses have their own laughter; gulls too. And there were the other jokes. The ones that came in, took off their shoes, and tracked mud carefully everywhere.\n\nBrownsea rose ahead, the black of trees against a grey-black sky. The skiff bumped under an overhang of roots and waited. They slid into the north grove by a path no human saw. The ground thrummed under the balls of Rill\u2019s feet; he felt the hum in his teeth and right down his bones to the bit of peg in his left ankle where he\u2019d once put a splinter of mast to hold himself together. It was a beautiful sound, the kind that makes you think of big doorways that have not yet opened, of rooms so well-built that the air inside them has a taste.\n\n\u201cWe should go slow,\u201d Kettle said softly. \u201cThis is\u2026 a place.\u201d\n\nNeedle peered into the underbrush. \u201cIt\u2019s also a place with burs. Ow. Ow.\u201d\n\nRill crouched. He could see, in the packed dirt, the faint shine of a line that had been there and was not now. It was the scuff you get when a heavy thing has been dragged or when an intention has been changed. He followed it to a small rise where the old badger set had been. It was collapsed now, apparently on purpose; the collapse was too neat. He put his ear to the ground and listened.\n\nHe heard a song. Not a human song, not a gull\u2019s. It was a song of edges. It told him that a shard had sat here, like a museum piece tucked into a pocket of dirt, humming to keep the soil from forgetting. It told him that the shard had been a key that didn\u2019t know the name of its door but knew it was important to keep small hands busy. It told him that three nights ago, someone had lifted it with reverence and kicked the makeshift plinth to show that they didn\u2019t need to bow to old layouts.\n\nHe lifted his head. \u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d he said, and the word had no weight left in it. \u201cIt\u2019s been gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Kettle said superfluously. \u201cHe?\u201d\n\n\u201cLikely.\u201d Rill stood and his knees popped like old bubbles. He touched the fringe of the hole. There, tongueing the edge, was a thread of red. Grin\u2019s least favorite color. He\u2019d used it here. That was rude in so many directions Rill couldn\u2019t count them all. He plucked the thread and held it to his nose. It smelled of wharf rope and smoke and the strange sweetness that comes from the inside of a joke. He handed it to Needle. She took it with her thimble and did not let it touch her skin.\n\nThere was a movement in the trees. All three sprites stilled as if they\u2019d never moved, never would again. A branch swung. A pair of eyes blinked, luminous. A human stepped out.\n\nShe was a child, which for humans meant she was monstrous in size and yet very new. She had a red jacket zipped wrong; her hood had ears but they were not her ears. She had a torch. It swung. The light on their faces must have looked like a caved-in star.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said, because most human children are born with more courage than good sense. \u201cAre you fairies.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call us that,\u201d Needle said reflexively. \u201cIt\u2019s a misnomer and an insult.\u201d\n\nKettle jabbed her with an elbow as big as a peach. \u201cWe\u2019re sprites,\u201d she said in a voice that an adult would have heard as wind in leaves, but children hear truer. \u201cYou are out too late.\u201d\n\nThe girl came closer, stepping over the collapsed badger set without seeing it. \u201cI heard music,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFrom my window. It sounded like my granddad humming when he made stew. I wanted to find it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGranddad stew song,\u201d Needle muttered. \u201cIt will be written on the back of many cookbooks.\u201d\n\nRill lifted his eyes to the girl\u2019s face. Her cheeks were freckled like someone had sprinkled nutmeg there. Her eyes were full of God-knows-what. He liked children. They were like new knots. Not tight yet. He had found a dozen in his life who could see him and a hundred who could not. He always took it as a sort of compliment when he was seen. It meant he had not over-worn his edges.\n\n\u201cYou should go home,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should follow your torch back.\u201d He put a bit of weight in his words so she would want to. It usually worked. It did not now.\n\n\u201cThe music stopped,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to make it go again.\u201d She put her hand out to them in a gesture that made Rill\u2019s heart do a quick wrong flip. She would fall in love very easily when she grew. Or she would fall into something else. He didn\u2019t know. He took a step back so he wouldn\u2019t be touched. Sprites and humans touching was complicated and sticky.\n\nThen the ground under all their feet exhaled and became less ground and more water. The hum gathered, knotted itself, and lifted in a wave. The girl squealed and went down on one knee, her torch skipping. Rill did not think. He had a peculiar skill that the Assembly did not like him to demonstrate but which he had taught himself on long evenings when the gulls were low. He could hook a heartbeat. He threw his left hand, the liar, and his right, the knotter, and caught the girl\u2019s pulse between them as if it were a bead on a string. He tugged. It brought her center back to where it should be. She did not fall fully. The wave passed. The girl looked at him as if he\u2019d told her a story only she could hear.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Needle said, her voice very small. \u201cYou\u2019ll get your hands filled with someone else\u2019s rhythm and then what? What if you can\u2019t empty them.\u201d\n\nKettle put a hand on the girl\u2019s shoulder, gentler than buttering toast. \u201cHome,\u201d she said again. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nAnd then a second light appeared between the trees, and laughter\u2014cruel only because it didn\u2019t belong\u2014came with it, skipping like a stone. Grin. He was perched on the low branch of a hornbeam, and his legs, dangling, were rhythmic. He clapped. \u201cRescue!\u201d he called. \u201cBravo! Round of applause, except we have no round hands. Ah well.\u201d He swung down and bowed to the child. \u201cDid anyone ever tell you to walk into the best part of a forest with a torch and a question? No? That\u2019s bad parenting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you,\u201d the girl whispered. She did not recoil. He had that effect. Moths. Flames. The tired old metaphor was tired and old for a reason.\n\n\u201cI am a person with a joke,\u201d Grin said seriously. \u201cWould you like to hear it? It\u2019s a good one. It\u2019s about people who think the world is real. Haha! I\u2019m kidding. The world is real.\u201d He put a finger on his lip. \u201cUp to a point. It\u2019s\u2026 historically real.\u201d He looked past the child at Rill and made a very small shrug. The kind that says: I\u2019m doing this because you aren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Rill said.\n\n\u201cWhy not,\u201d Grin said with a wide-eyed innocence that would have been convincing if the lights had not shuddered at the corners of his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful joke. I can only make it once. Everyone will be thrilled\u2014later.\u201d\n\nKettle stepped between the child and Grin, brazier catching the torchlight and making gold patterns on the leaves. She was not big enough, no one ever was, but she placed her body with authority. \u201cNo jokes here.\u201d\n\nGrin stood on his toes and peered over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll tell it when she\u2019s gone then. Rill? Did you come for the shard? Did you come with your clever fingers? I was going to leave it for you as a present. But then I thought\u2014no. No. It will be more\u2026 comedic if you have to chase.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it back,\u201d Rill said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t yours to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTo what? To poke? To prop? To pry. Words are doors. We all know it. You just like to pretend your doorways don\u2019t go to bad places. Sweet Rill. The world has bad places that are also right. If you build a gate, someone should use it. Otherwise why build the gate.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s torch flickered. The night seemed to take a breath. Kettle made the decision. She pushed the girl gently back the way she had come. \u201cFollow the smell of chocolate,\u201d she said in the tone of a spell, \u201cand you\u2019ll find the path.\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes widened as if she could smell it already. She backed, then turned, then ran. The trees made room for her because Kettle had told them to.\n\nRill stepped forward. \u201cYou touch her again and I\u2019ll tie your laughter to your teeth,\u201d he said, his voice even. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to spit it out to breathe.\u201d\n\nGrin\u2019s eyes glittered in the torch-skim. \u201cPromises,\u201d he sighed. \u201cSo heavy. I\u2019ll make you a promise too. I will hurt no child. I will hurt everyone else. And everyone will laugh. And that\u2019s the wicked joke.\u201d\n\nNeedle, whose patience was always thinner than a gull\u2019s patience with a chip bag, said, \u201cYou loathsome twig. You coward. You can\u2019t even do wickedness straight. You have to hide it behind a pun.\u201d She took a step as if to stab him with her needle, which she did in fact carry, the iron glinting.\n\n\u201cAh, ah,\u201d Grin said, wagging. \u201cDon\u2019t stab me. It will make me leak jokes everywhere and then no one will be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the shard,\u201d Rill said. He felt the question as a thread in his tongue.\n\nGrin lifted his hands in a theatrical, innocent gesture. They were empty. He tapped his jacket, his pockets. \u201cOops,\u201d he said. \u201cNow where did I put the end of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop it,\u201d Kettle groaned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not starting it,\u201d Grin said. \u201cIt was started long before I got here. I just\u2026 punch it up. Don\u2019t you love the phrase? Punch up. Punchlines. Lines that punch. Gates that open when you tap them just right. We\u2019re all perched on the end of a sentence and it\u2019s a long one and it has too many commas.\u201d\n\nHe turned. He was gone. It was a wink, a blink, and he had folded into the shadow behind the hornbeam, as if someone had shut him in a book. Rill threw after him the sort of knot you throw at running things, which is to say a looping slip of will that makes anchors of ankles, but it passed the shadow and found only a rabbit. The rabbit yawned and scratched and went home.\n\nKettle crouched and pressed both palms into the earth. \u201cHe took it,\u201d she said in the flat voice of someone reading a fact. \u201cHe took it and he will make a joke with it.\u201d\n\nRill knelt too. The hum in the ground was less now, like a song after someone has closed a door. He stuck his hand into the collapsed earth until dirt lined his wrist and came back with nothing. He put his palm flat on the dirt and pressed until he could feel the world\u2019s breath again.\n\n\u201cI can follow him,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThere\u2019s a\u2026 sliver he always leaves. He can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s a piece of his mouth he doesn\u2019t use. It tastes like copper.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t lick the earth,\u201d Needle said. \u201cAgain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Rill said indistinctly because he had indeed just done it. \u201cHe\u2019s going to the chalk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cliff,\u201d Kettle said. Her voice was unhappy. \u201cHe\u2019s going to tell a joke to the cliff? That\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRude,\u201d Needle supplied.\n\n\u201cExtremely rude,\u201d Kettle agreed. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Before he finds a better audience.\u201d\n\nThey took the path that wasn\u2019t a path, the one that went sideways. Rill liked those. He\u2019d always been partial to diagonals. He whistled once, a sound pitched in the notch between cricket and kettle, and a cormorant, black as silence, dropped from the air and folded its feet neatly on a post as they passed. It watched them with the old intelligence of ungentled things. Rill pressed a knuckle to its beak in greeting.\n\nThey cut along the edge of the harbour where the lights made lanes. Rill kept his eyes on the dark beyond them, the line between where things are and where they are not. He had learned his way around those lines. He had built a life of it. He was good at it. The harbour sucked at its teeth. He thought of the child\u2019s heartbeat stuck a moment in his hands. That was not his job. He\u2019d always told himself that. He was for edges and doors and things you could pull gently and they gave. Not for beating back waves. Not for standing between.\n\nSomewhere in the flat of the mid-water, a pod of dolphins rolled. He saw their backs. He tucked the sight behind his ribs like a penny.\n\nThey reached the chalk cliffs just as the moon got tired of the whole charade and went down to do something else. Grin was already there, and of course he was, standing on an outcrop that looked like a broken tooth. The wind up here was a different thing than it was at the harbour. It had ideas. It wanted to throw. Grin had his hands in his pockets, and his jacket was wrong for the weather; it always was.\n\n\u201cTell me you\u2019ve not yet told it,\u201d Rill said without preamble. The sky tasted of iron.\n\nGrin did not turn right away. When he did, his face was blue with the light. \u201cTell me you\u2019ve come to help,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cMy timing is good. The world\u2019s timing is better. I\u2019m going to marry them.\u201d He wrinkled his nose. \u201cYou know when you say a word so much it becomes a bit of paste in your mouth? World. World. World. We were all saying it wrong anyway. We meant something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me the shard,\u201d Rill said.\n\nGrin grinned. \u201cSay please.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Rill said, and he meant it.\n\nGrin\u2019s grin faltered. For a moment it became a real mouth, not a heraldic device. He looked at Rill. There was something like sadness there. Rill wondered, too late, if he could have been a different thing, if someone had laughed the right way at him at the right minute. And then Grin brightened and the moment was gone like someone had snuffed a match with wet fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, with a comical little wince. \u201cI ate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou what,\u201d Kettle and Needle said in unison.\n\nGrin patted his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not unsafe. I\u2019m just\u2026 keyed. And when I say the line, it will turn. On my rib. Isn\u2019t that awfully intimate? I feel very closer to myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Rill said again. \u201cDon\u2019t notch the air. Not with that in you. It will cut all the way through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help myself,\u201d Grin pleaded, and for a second it looked as if he meant it. He raised his hands, as if to attract the lightning. \u201cI have a terrible sense of\u2026 timing.\u201d\n\nKettle punched him. Or tried. He stepped aside. She almost went over the edge. Rill snagged the back of her coat with two fingers. The wind took that as an insult and slapped him. He swallowed it. Needle, who had no patience left at all now, threw her needle. Grin caught it. He looked surprised. He hadn\u2019t expected her to actually throw it.\n\n\u201cTell me the joke,\u201d Rill said, and his voice was the sound you hear when a rope reaches the end of its give. \u201cTell me the joke you think is going to change everything, and then maybe I can\u2026 knots. I can tie it. Make it safe.\u201d\n\nGrin squinted at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t tie a joke, Rill.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I can,\u201d he said almost kindly. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. I tie things that want to go everywhere. I tie them so people can use them later, so they don\u2019t cut their hands on them.\u201d\n\nGrin\u2019s eyes were full of the moving light of the sea at night. \u201cI don\u2019t want this joke to be safe,\u201d he said. He turned then and faced the cliff and spread his arms. The world held his outline in a shallow bowl like it might spill him. He shouted the joke into the chalk.\n\nIt was not obscene. It wasn\u2019t even clever. It wasn\u2019t filthy or full of knives. It was a pun with too much weight on its hinge. It was a line about lines and endings and the way we say \u201cIt will be the end of me\u201d as if it were a story\u2019s end and not a statement of geography. He made the end of me into the end of we, and he braced it between two bits of rock that had been aching for a lever since the day they were born from sea.\n\nThe cliff laughed. It had never done that before. The sound was old and huge and wrong. It rattled into the harbour and broke the smaller laughs into sea-foam. A crack appeared at Grin\u2019s feet, small as a hair. It widened. It ran away like someone on a tight schedule. It went under the water and kept going, because cracks do not necessarily stop where we think they should.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kettle said, but she was saying it to a tide.\n\nRill moved before he knew he had moved. He had a skill and he had used it on little things: bottles and threads and the breath of a gull caught in a shoal of plastic. He used it now on the air. He made a knot in it, a simple old knot, the kind you use to hold a tarpaulin in a gale. He threw the knot at the sound. It snagged for a second, and for that second the earth\u2019s teeth stopped chattering. Then the knot slipped, because he\u2019d tied it in the wrong place. The joke was too heavy for that tie. It was a lever and a guillotine. He felt it slide away from his hands like a fish that changed its mind about being a dinner.\n\nGrin laughed. He had to. He had locked the laugh to the line. He clutched his chest. The shard turned in his rib. He made a surprised face, like someone who\u2019d swallowed a stone and discovered it was actually a bell. He doubled over and laughed again. His laughter had an edge now; it could cut through rope.\n\n\u201cI told you,\u201d he said breathlessly, between laughs. \u201cI told\u2026 you\u2026\u201d He coughed. His eyes watered. He went to one knee and let his hands rest on the ground. The crack at his feet widened another hair. It gathered a family of other cracks and the children ran off together, screaming.\n\nRill thought of the girl. He felt sick. He fell to his own knees and put his face to the wind and said something in a language he only knew when he was standing where things began and ended. The wind thought about it. It didn\u2019t say no. It said: You are small.\n\nHe stood. He put a hand on Kettle\u2019s arm and on Needle\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop this here,\u201d he said. He wanted to add: yet. He didn\u2019t. He was not a liar with his mouth, only his hand.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do,\u201d Kettle said, and she did not sound like she believed in any answer he could give. She believed in him and that was worse. Needle swore in a way that made a spider nearby blush.\n\nRill looked at Grin, who had fallen on his side and was still shaking with the laughter he had wanted so much he\u2019d put it where his bones were. \u201cWe follow the crack,\u201d Rill said. \u201cWe follow it and we tie as we go, and we find where he\u2019s made the line attach to everything and we pry it off. And we find a joke that is better and put it on top of his and smother it.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cAnd we hope the world likes our punchline more than his.\u201d\n\nGrin looked up at him, eyes streaming. \u201cI told you you\u2019d help,\u201d he gasped. Then he laughed again and his whole body shook and the sea threw up its white hands and the shore of the island lurched as if it had drunk too fast.\n\nAnd somewhere in Poole, in a little house near the quay, a child in a red jacket climbed into her bed and dreamed that the walls were telling jokes to each other and that she had to tell them to stop. She said \u201cNo,\u201d and in her dream it worked for a second, and then the dream slipped, and she woke to the sound of something old learning to split.\n\nRill stood under a sky that was too big for what he had to do. He put his hands together. He was a small thing. He had what he had. He had the exact set of skills the Assembly had praised and admonished and had threatened to cut from him if he used them in the wrong place. He had his left hand and his right. He had the taste of rust and lark-song and old rope in his mouth. He had his own stubborn heartbeat. He looked at Kettle and Needle and nodded once because saying anything right now would be wrong. They nodded back. Their faces were all sharp edges cut out of morning.\n\nThey ran along the cliff as the world cracked, tying the air with knots that held for breaths at a time, choking the wrong laugh with right silence where they could. Grin lay behind them and shook and shook. He was happy, insofar as he could be. He had set the line in motion. He had told his joke. It would continue whether he was there to timing it or not.\n\nAnd Rill of Poole, who could in his own quiet way set things right, went to try to find the end of a laughter that was unkind and put a thread around it. If he could just get the right thread. If he could find the tail. He had always been good at that. There had to be one. There is for everything, he told himself. He told the cracked earth. He told the wind. He told the slow-moving ferries and the gulls and the stones and the ghosts of fishermen under the Jetty of Glass.\n\nHe told the world there is always a tail to pull, and in telling it, he felt the mad, bright cut of hope. He grabbed. He tugged. The air squealed. Somewhere, faintly, the wrong laughter hiccuped, and for a heartbeat the sound of the harbour came back clear: ropes and bells and the clatter of a pub door and someone telling a story very badly in a corner, and all of it ordinary.\n\nThen the crack answered. It said Ha. And the ground under them said Yes. And the sky, shameless as ever, pretended it had no idea what was happening.\n\nHe did not let go. He had not let go when things were smaller; he would not now. The line burned in his hands as if it were hot. He knew it would scar. He kept pulling.\n\nHe had never been afraid of scars. They were just knots in skin.",

                              "content": "The first place the crack tested itself was a gorse thicket that had spent forty-seven summers holding its yellow candles up to storm and sun with equal ceremony. The line ran beneath its roots like a bright idea, and the thicket, being a sensible citizen of the coast, decided, after some creaking debate, to become two thickets with a polite space between them. Rill, running crooked along the cliff with his breath a saw in his ribs, flung a knot into the gap and held it trembling. Kettle slapped a smear of blue clay against the raw edge and whispered the old ward she used for keeping her brazier lids from rattling in a blow. Needle trotted after, stamping iron filings into the seam so that the joke\u2019s edge would shy off as if it had seen a magnet it didn\u2019t fancy. The thicket, impressed at being addressed like a person, reconsidered. It stayed one thicket for three more heartbeats, which felt like winning the lottery while the bank was burning.\n\nThey learned the new rhythm as they went. The crack didn\u2019t cut straight; no clever thing ever does. It sought old weaknesses to hide its innovation, following salt lines and rabbit runs, kissing a fissure that had been lonely since the winter of 1972 when a cargo lorry, lost in fog and contrition, had pressed too hard on the verge. There, Rill\u2019s rope-sense made him curse under his breath because he could feel the laughter riding ahead of the split, a flock of sharp little ha-has crowding into crevices like starlings, making roosts of cavities, planning mischief. He threw his left hand at them and missed deliberately, letting the false throw draw the sound toward him as a gull will swoop to a hand that never had a chip in it, only to be outwitted by the second hand that does. With his right he tied a sailor\u2019s stopper across the mouth of a hole and heard the chuckle go flat against it like a wave slapped by a pier.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t over-clever it,\u201d Kettle warned without looking up from her work gluing the air together with clay and a mutter. \u201cClever is how we arrived here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Rill said, and if he had been less out of breath he might have tried to sound offended on behalf of his own outrageous simplicity. \u201cI\u2019m using ordinary knots in extraordinary weather.\u201d\n\n\u201cSemantics,\u201d Needle said, which to her was an insult and a benediction in equal measure. She had a scrap of the red thread wrapped around her thimble so she could taste where Grin\u2019s trail had brushed the world. Every time the crack took a turn he would have loved, the thread warmed against her skin as if embarrassed. \u201cHe isn\u2019t steering it,\u201d she reported. \u201cBut it knows where he laughs best.\u201d\n\nThey chained the cliff together with temporary stitches and made for town because the crack had already beaten them there. Poole\u2019s night, which had been composed of good customary sounds, had acquired a new note like crockery being washed very briskly in a cathedral. They could hear the Twin Sails bridge complaining as if someone had asked it to waltz to a march. Each pivot groaned in its sockets. The cables thrummed. Down at the ferry berths, timetables untied themselves and drifted into the water like startled jellyfish. The gulls, who had learned the hours, argued bitterly among themselves about whether to trust laughs that changed the clink of a spoon on glass.\n\nRill slid to a halt under the first of the salt-arches and braced his hands against his knees. The harbour blew his hair back with a breath that tasted of iron filings and history. \u201cWe need more hands,\u201d he said, not because he wanted to be saved by a committee but because his fingers were full to the nail-beds with hot, humming line. \u201cWe need the Assembly\u2019s old knots and anyone with a pocket full of even-tempered jokes.\u201d\n\nKettle nodded, face slick with sweat that left pale maps on her moss-coloured hair. \u201cGreen George will have rope. Thatch will have stories. Nix owes me two favours and a bucket. We\u2019ll spend them.\u201d She set off at a trot, brazier clacking encouragement at her like a chorus of copper-beaked birds. Needle fell in beside Rill and matched him breath for breath, which meant she was suffering more than she let him see. She had a way of doing that, and he let her because it would shame her to consider being seen needing.\n\nUnder the Jetty of Glass, the light was folded tight as a scarf and the ghosts of fishermen had gathered already, not because anyone called but because when the harbour changes its laugh, those who gave it their throats in life feel the draught. Elder Thatch stood dead centre with Green George at his shoulder, both of them wearing their beards and consequences with equal gravity. In the edges, lesser sprites in their particularities lined the pilings: Nix with her bucket and her unrepaired regret, Blot with his ink-blackened hands, the vine-twins with ivy down to their shins, Candle with a wick poking from his cap like a thought he intended to ignite later.\n\n\u201cWe felt the split,\u201d Thatch said as Rill ducked through, and the old one\u2019s voice came out like a rope uncoiling from a barrel, fast and steady. \u201cWe felt the laugh go into the water. You are bringing it with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to undo it,\u201d Rill said, lifting his stinging hands to show the bright line-mark scalding his palms like a lover\u2019s letters. \u201cHe set a hinge in the chalk. The shard is inside him.\u201d He did not say Grin\u2019s name because he didn\u2019t want to watch their mouths harden or soften the wrong way. \u201cThe line wants to be a river. We need to make it a string again.\u201d\n\nGreen George stepped forward and pressed a coil against Rill\u2019s chest. It was made of horsehair and willow and a stubbornness that had kept bridges up through twelve storms. \u201cThis likes to be tied around things that get away,\u201d George said mildly. \u201cIt\u2019s made of patience. It will remember what you ask it to remember if you ask with both hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not touching that,\u201d Needle said, eyeing the coil as if it had teeth. \u201cIt looks like it will ask to be fed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will,\u201d Kettle said, and took it, looping it around her shoulders as if it had always lived there. The coil settled like a cat around a waist that knew the give of ropes. \u201cI\u2019ll feed it soup and propriety.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also need a joke,\u201d Rill said. He tasted blood and a story could not tell whether it was his lip or the air that had split. \u201cHe made an ending into a weapon. We need a line that turns endings into tools for staying, not for falling apart. Something people can carry in their mouths that will weigh the laugh down when it wants to float.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a counter-spell written in silliness,\u201d Blot mused, ink on his fingers making his cheeks a map of night. \u201cGood. Those are the only ones that stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a lamplighter,\u201d Needle offered, though she gave the word with a tightness that confessed she was nervous to have her joke judged. \u201cIt comforted a lamp. It isn\u2019t a big thing, but it is honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonest makes a knot hold,\u201d Thatch declared. He plucked a strand of his beard and made a loop of it and flicked it to Rill as if to say, use what I am. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a child\u2019s word too. Children tell the sea no without embarrassment. If you can ask it as only a child can, the laugh will trip over its laces.\u201d\n\nRill had already thought of the girl. It made him feel like a thief to even shape the thought. He looked at Kettle and Kettle looked back with a mouth that had opinions about the use of children in work that smelled of sharp edges. He nodded before she could speak. \u201cIf. If her if wants to. If her no already lives in her without my asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d a small voice said from behind a stack of glass. Poppy, red jacket zipped wrong and ears perched on the hood like comments, stood with her torch held like a wand she\u2019d never asked for. Her cheeks were bright from running; her shoelaces were, in fact, untied. She had slipped in under the Jetty as if she belonged, which, for tonight at least, she did. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. The walls were laughing, and then they got scared of themselves and started hiccuping. Mum said it was the pipes and to go to bed, and I did, but the cracking noise made my teeth itchy, and my granddad\u2019s stew song isn\u2019t supposed to sound like that. So I came here because I saw you, and you are made of the same sort of sound.\u201d\n\nKettle breathed out very slowly, as if letting go of a lid while setting a simmer to where it wanted to be. \u201cYou are brave,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is another word for a problem when you are small and the world is not. What is your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoppy,\u201d the girl said. \u201cLike the red. Like what happens in the air when it\u2019s very hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoppy,\u201d Rill said gently, and the name tasted like pepper and paper. \u201cI took your heartbeat when you were falling. I should not have without your leave. Do you want me to put it back if it is still in my hand at all.\u201d\n\nPoppy blinked, then grinned a little, like someone being given a story she would be able to tell later to children who would laugh at the right places. \u201cIt\u2019s in me again,\u201d she declared with the sovereign calm of the very young. \u201cIt feels very tired, but it\u2019s mine. Thank you. My mum says if you borrow something you should say what you did with it so the person can put it back where it goes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried that,\u201d Rill said gravely. \u201cIt resisted being told where to go. It is a sprite, apparently.\u201d\n\nPoppy giggled and then clapped a hand over her mouth because there was too much laugh in the room already and she felt it. \u201cI can say no,\u201d she offered, and the way she said it had absolutely no rust on it at all. \u201cBut the walls at home don\u2019t always listen. They\u2019re polite, but sometimes they say \u2018we\u2019re busy\u2019 and they squeak in the back hall anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWalls are notorious for doing housework when no one looks,\u201d Needle said, and a thin smile cut its way across her sharp face, unwilling and grateful for the company. \u201cWe need your no where the crack is not yet decided it is a road,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you put it there, it will have to consider manners.\u201d\n\nElder Thatch climbed down from his crate, each step an old decision re-made. He put his hand over Poppy\u2019s torch and the flame did not go out, because this was not that sort of story, but it leaned and listened, which was all fire has ever wanted to do. \u201cChild who chose us,\u201d he said, giving her a title because titles are old coats that sometimes fit new shoulders. \u201cDo you want to help hold the harbour together. If you do not, we will applaud your refusal. If you do, we will hum a stew song with you.\u201d\n\nPoppy looked at all of them, a small, singular person assembling a meaning for herself from old splendours. \u201cI don\u2019t want my mum to be sad,\u201d she said, which was the answer of a general. \u201cI\u2019ll say no where you tell me but I don\u2019t want to stand on anything high.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not,\u201d Kettle promised, and in that promise she tied three other ropes that Rill could feel: we will carry you, we will stop before you ask, and we will let you make the rule when we can.\n\nThere was not enough time and there was too much to do. The crack had threaded the quay and by the time they ran to the Twin Sails, the bridge had lifted itself an inch without being asked, as if testing poses for a dance lesson. The sewer beneath Rill\u2019s old plank had changed its cough to a whistle. Blue clay smeared under the bridge from earlier breathed in relief when it saw him, dimly alive to the notion that someone who cared about cataloguing wishes was nearby. He crouched where he had put his mark and felt the seam he\u2019d left answer his fingers like a cat pressing cheek to cheek.\n\n\u201cBorrow me,\u201d he told it, and the clay sighed petroleum and time and moved like a living tongue. He scooped it up and Kettle steadied the runaway bit into a loop around Poppy\u2019s wrist. \u201cIt will help your no stick to stone,\u201d Kettle murmured as she smoothed the cool weight around the girl\u2019s skin. \u201cIt will come off when you tell it. It listens to you now.\u201d\n\nOut over the dark, the ferry horns tried to maintain decorum and became a little hysterical, like vicarage teapots seeing a fire drill. The oystermen\u2019s boards clacked of their own volition, counting without being told to. Needle stepped to the bridge rail and threw her voice down into the piles, saying a word made of iron syllables so that the barnacles would hold tight for an hour more. Barnacles do everything because of pride; being asked properly is their favourite luxury.\n\nRill stretched his arms and felt his hands ache for the work. He called the map that had his harbour tucked into its paper like a sleeping cat. It came, convinced by habit and need, and flattened itself against the bridge where the gulls couldn\u2019t poop on it by mistake. It sang of its edges, and he heard the new line as a hiss being drawn across its belly. He spoke to it the way you talk to a frightened horse, telling it it was still itself even if someone had ideas. The map stilled. The hiss quivered. Poppy put her small clay-banded wrist upon a squiggle that indicated the mouth of the muddier drain and said no with awful precision, not loud, not theatrical, as if stopping a friend from stepping into a road because a car was there. The hissing at that place stopped and the map blinked, a cartography of surprise correcting its breath.\n\n\u201cYou are very good at that,\u201d Needle said, half to herself and half to the child, astonished that such a blunt tool could be so fine. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a magic no. It\u2019s a practical one.\u201d\n\n\u201cPractical magic is what kitchens are for,\u201d Kettle said with professional pride. She had the horsehair coil looped and was letting it unspool as needed, pressing its memory into the bridge so that when it lifted, if it had to, it would remember how to come down.\n\nGrin, somewhere behind the chalk\u2019s broken tooth, laughed again, and the laugh rolled over town in a sheet. All the laughter in the pubs stuttered, then changed key. The wrong laugh did not care about their stew song or their promises; it cared about its own success, the way a bad story cares about its twist. Rill flinched as if hit and tied two quick knots in his mind just to stop from tying them into air by accident. He had to be careful. His hands wanted to get to work everywhere, and everywhere could not be held by two hands.\n\nThey moved in a pattern that felt like a recipe, which comforted Kettle and steadied Rill more than he would ever admit. Around the bridge, under the greasy orange glare of old lamps, into the narrow lanes where everything was made of brick and opinion, they stitched and soothed. They asked a cranky drain that had thought to empty its belly all over a cellar to please wait and told it a joke about a bucket that thought it was a lake and the bucket calmed down out of embarrassment. They stood in front of an old bakery that had a row of cracked-glass windows like a grin and said no to the floor where the laugh wanted to draw a line up through the ovens, and the ovens, which had confidence in their vocation and a grudge against abruptness, closed their mouths in solidarity. They asked the lamplighter\u2019s joke to sit on the shoulder of a policeman who was using all his training not to shout at the night. The joke rubbed his epaulettes and he relaxed enough to ask the wind to breathe slower and the wind, chastened by courtesy, did.\n\nPoppy\u2019s eyes got bigger and then steadier. She began to treat her no like a paintbrush, putting it down in little flicks and long strokes. Her tongue poked out at the corner of her mouth when she worked, and every time she executed a proper stop the laugh skittered. Not all of them held, and when one slipped it made her shoulders hunch in a way Rill knew was not good for a growing backbone. He put a hand above her head without touching and took some of the strain, pulling the tautness out like old wire. She did not see him do it and that was how he wanted it. A child should not be a rope.\n\nThey took a breather in the lee of a warehouse where salt had drawn ferns on brick, and Kettle made everyone drink something that tasted like black pepper and low tide and might have been soup or spell or a lesson disguised as both. It put heat back where it had been taken. Even the cormorant, who had been following them with the offended dignity of a critic who cannot deny the good bits, blinked and sat a little taller on a bollard. Across the channel, Brownsea showed no immediate opinion of their efforts, which was either a good sign or the patience of trees who\u2019ve seen worse and refuse to be hurried.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to go back to him,\u201d Needle said, tearing a hanging thread from the cuff of her own coat and plaiting it with two others so her fingers had something to bite. \u201cWe\u2019ll be patching forever if we don\u2019t take the hinge out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Rill said, and he placed his sore palms against the cold-of-night brick and felt it approvingly hold. \u201cBut we cannot move him by will or by shame. We\u2019ll need to pull the shard through the line he made. He set the joke like a fishbone; we have to cut the meat around it and slide it out backwards, or we\u2019ll tear the whole throat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an image,\u201d Kettle muttered, but she did not disapprove. \u201cHe\u2019ll fight you because he thinks being pulled back makes his joke bigger. We\u2019ll need something he wants more than he wants the laugh.\u201d\n\nRill thought of the moment by the cliff when Grin\u2019s grin had slipped and a real mouth had showed through, tired and nearly tender. He thought of the old wish in it, the one that some of them shared, the one that makes you think if you could only say it right once the world would fix itself like a coat under a good needle. He felt a passing sorrow for a clever mouth wasted, which was dangerous because it makes you gentle where you should be firm. \u201cHe wants to be undeniable,\u201d Rill said. \u201cIf we offer him a denial made by something he respects, he will bite because he thinks he\u2019s bigger. He respects not being allowed. He collects it.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s nos,\u201d Needle said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to hear them properly. He thinks he invented refusal.\u201d She looked at Poppy, then at Kettle, and the corners of her mouth went strange as if she had swallowed three arguments and only one had agreed to stay down. \u201cWe can bring her no to him with a net around it so it touches only what it should. He won\u2019t be able to help himself. He\u2019ll lean into it and we\u2019ll pull. But we will not put the child on the cliff.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d Kettle said, and in the look she gave Rill there was a fair copy of his own resolve. \u201cWe\u2019ll carry the no like a lantern and keep her at the Jetty where walls listen and ghosts mind their manners.\u201d\n\nPoppy chewed her lip, considering the idea that part of her might go where she did not. \u201cI can make two nos,\u201d she announced cautiously, like someone offering a spare biscuit with the clear understanding that it was valuable.\n\n\u201cYou can make as many as you like,\u201d Kettle said. \u201cBut we will only borrow one. And we will return it with thanks.\u201d\n\nGreen George, who had listened with a carpenter\u2019s patience, pulled from his coat a length of grey silk as wide as a finger. It had knots down its length, each one a different sort: square, figure-eight, sheet bend, a whole rosary of securing. The silk smelled faintly of wet wool and stories told on boats after the tea has gone cold. \u201cThis holds declarations,\u201d he said. \u201cI had it for births and names. Tie your no into it, Poppy, and it will not fray.\u201d He set it out on a crate. The ghosts leaned closer, avid with an old hunger for craft.\n\nPoppy squared her shoulders and knelt, the clay bracelet catching Jetty-light like wet slate. She put her small fingers on the silk and said \u201cno\u201d as if she were teaching it to spell. It went in like a nail into good wood. The knot held. The silk warmed and the knots along it lifted like little heads, all of them saying we heard, we heard. Rill, who loved and feared knots in equal measure, felt his chest loosen just slightly as if he had been tied politely to the day and someone had asked him whether he wanted to be.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Thatch said, his eyes brighter and his beard heavier with a hundred places. \u201cGo before the laugh decides it can swim better than us.\u201d\n\nThey went, because when old instructions arrive in the right coat you run in them, not away from them. The path to the chalk felt different now that they had a thing to carry that could stop a joke. The wind, which had been argumentative all night, put its back into their going. Rill did not look at the sky for help; he had given up expecting cooperation from anything that never needed a knot. At the cliff, the crack had been busy during their absence and had reached two extra-seasons into the stone. The little lines ran like mice. The big one sat there the way a long word sits in the middle of a sentence, smug because it knows you have to say it before you can finish.\n\nGrin lay where they had left him, curled around his laughter as if it were precious and leaking both. His face had gone paler in a way that was not theatrical; it was the colour people turn when they\u2019ve been braver than their blood likes. His eyes flicked to them when they came because he could always find audiences even if they were composed of his enemies. He tried to sit up and his ribs told him a joke about hinges and he winced and laughed and glared at his own chest, betrayed by his own art.\n\n\u201cYou came back,\u201d he said, genuinely surprised and a hair grateful in a manner he would hate himself for later. \u201cYou brought a child\u2019s weather. That\u2019s unfair. Children have barometers that never lie. It takes all the sport from storms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe brought a no,\u201d Rill said calmly. \u201cAnd soup if you would like to be less clever while we work.\u201d He set Kettle\u2019s lidded tin to one side where the steam could comfort without promising more than it could give. Kettle kept herself between Poppy, who was not present in body but sang in silk, and Grin\u2019s eyes, because even looking is a sort of touch in the wrong story.\n\nGrin sniffed ostentatiously and then showed his teeth. \u201cDo I look like a person who eats soup,\u201d he demanded, affronted in that particular way only earnest generosity can provoke. \u201cI eat weather and blushes and the last bits of words.\u201d His nose twitched. \u201cIs that pepper. All right. Later. Show me your trick.\u201d\n\nRill held up Green George\u2019s silk and the knot that held Poppy\u2019s no. The no did not glow or hum. It sat in the silk as ordinary as a button in an old shirt, thoughtful, sure of itself. Grin\u2019s lip curled, then relaxed. He cocked his head. The laugh in his chest seized. He breathed through it like a woman who had decided to be both patient and furious in labour. He raised a hand and, delicately, the way he would touch a joke he respected even if it was not his, he reached toward the knot.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Kettle said, but she said it in the voice you use for touching a hot thing carefully. \u201cIf you touch it, it will be in you as well as your laugh. You will have to say no to yourself. It hurts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am extremely good at hurting,\u201d Grin said, and surprised them by not sounding triumphant. He put his finger on the knot and the knot did not burn him. It did not freeze him either. It paused his touch. It told him, clearly and kindly and without flourish, that he could not go further in that direction. It did not shame him for wanting to. It simply took the direction away. Grin\u2019s eyes widened in a way that would have been comical if it had not been so naked. That was the thing about a child\u2019s no. It is not a weapon. It is a road-closed sign in honest sunlight.\n\nRill watched his face and with the muscle memory of a hundred nights spent unpicking things that thought they were finished, he slid his hands to Grin\u2019s chest. He did not touch skin. He put his palms a whisper above him and felt for the rib where the shard had turned. It thrummed, a lovely, strange, ill-placed music. He had been right; the joke had braced itself between two bits of bone that thought they\u2019d been asked to hold up a song. He had to admire the craft of the disaster even while he undid it. He told Grin what he was doing because it is rude not to explain when you are about to untie someone\u2019s inside ideas, even if that someone is an irritation and a risk.\n\n\u201cI will pull the hinge through the line you made,\u201d he said, and he let his voice sit quietly on the air because shouting at air is like kicking a river. \u201cIt will feel like hearing yourself say a word you said yesterday again, but wrong. Don\u2019t try to fix it. Let it be wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI despise wrongness I did not choose,\u201d Grin breathed, eyes wet with laughter that was beginning to frighten even him. He put his clever mouth in a line. \u201cDo it. Do it. If you are to thwart me, do it better than I thwarted myself.\u201d\n\nPoppy\u2019s no stayed where it was supposed to stay, and Rill, holding its tether, moved his left hand in a small arc while his right curled the air flat against Grin\u2019s heart. He found the tail. He knew it by the way it wanted to be a beginning while being placed foolishly in an ending. He tugged and the world hiccuped again and Kettle made a wordless sound that meant she would hold something that broke if everything else went wrong. Needle, whose job it was to make holes orderly, caught the loose laughter falling out with her thimble and popped it like a fish eye. It stank of puns. She did not flinch.\n\nThe shard came carefully, reluctantly, a sliver of chalk with a varnish of old ebb on it. It slid through the line of the joke like a needle through envy and came away singing to itself about sea and distance and how it was built for slotting into edges, not for sitting in a chest where ribs are playing cards. Grin gasped. He stopped laughing because there was no hinge now and what came out of him was not a laugh but a sound people make when they see a cliff and understand cliffs. He clutched the space above his heart and glared at Rill with murderous gratitude.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t break it,\u201d Rill said softly to Needle, who was already considering how to stab the song quiet just in case. He set the shard upon the silk, far from the no but near enough that they might advise one another. The ground under them tried a feeble ha and failed in the face of a refusal it could not misinterpret. The big crack, deprived of its weight, ceased being a line and became a wobble. The little ones sat down like children who have been told gently by a kind person that the game is over.\n\nKettle bent and pressed a damp cloth she had not had a moment ago to Grin\u2019s throat. He flinched and then leaned into it because his body was a better person than he was. \u201cYou are not allowed to eat keys,\u201d she told him with the patient fury of a cook addressing a goat. \u201cYou are not clever in that direction. Eat pepper instead. Eat the last two minutes of a bad show. Eat praise from people who didn\u2019t listen fully. Leave the world\u2019s hinges where they fit.\u201d\n\nGrin closed his eyes and the grin on his mouth faded to something that might one day be a smile if he spent a very long time practicing humility as if it were instrument. \u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d he whispered, and because he was him he meant the way his joke fit; because he was not only him he also meant what they had done to stop it. \u201cI hate you. Don\u2019t go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d Rill said, and because he was him, he meant: we\u2019ll stay until we\u2019ve catalogued this properly and marked the underside of it with blue clay so the water knows where to file the day.\n\nDown in Poole, doors stopped rattling their own handles. At the Jetty of Glass, the ghosts who had been leaning forward to listen leaned back and made a noise like ropes slackening in contentment. Poppy\u2019s mum stood in the doorway of her little house, hands on hips, and called her daughter\u2019s name into a night that had stopped pretending to be a comedy. Poppy sighed because she was needed in two places at once and it was a good problem. \u201cCan I go home now,\u201d she asked politely, as if they had been keeping her from bed by telling an overly long story about doors.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kettle said at once. \u201cRill will walk you and make walls behave if they forget you are their priority.\u201d\n\nPoppy set her palm on the silk and patted her own no, which purred like a contented kettle, and then she peered at Grin with the frankness of a child who has assisted with a public medical procedure. \u201cDon\u2019t put things in yourself that don\u2019t live there,\u201d she advised, and then, perhaps because she was seven and tired of being an occasion, she added, \u201cDuh.\u201d\n\nGrin laughed, just once, without architecture. The sound ran toward the harbour and made two gulls change their minds about a quarrel, and then it didn\u2019t do anything at all, which is to say it was harmless. He flopped back and closed his eyes and tried to thank no one out loud. It came out as a sigh with ambition.\n\nRill tucked the shard into his jacket after wrapping it in silk that had once been a prayer and more recently a fishing license. It hummed faintly, calm now that it was not misapplied. He would take it to the north grove and set it back into a bed Kettle would make for it from sand and nettle-rind and the whisper of badger thanks. He would ask it to hum softer until he could convince someone wiser than all of them to sing over it while the squirrels returned to work. There were logistics. There were always logistics. He loved them because they meant the world had chosen to go on.\n\nThey stood there a while, the four of them and the uninvited fifth who had made himself necessary by being unbearable, and listened to the sea re-learn its ordinary jokes. The chalk sighed in a long, delicious release like a tooth taken out that had ached for weeks and was now allowed to surprise itself by being gone. The sky behaved like a sky. The wind made sassy remarks about everyone\u2019s hair and then remembered it was not the main event.\n\nWhen they finally moved, it was together, in the haphazard grace of people whose feet have learned each other. Kettle took Poppy\u2019s clay wrist and Needle carried the silk with its new knot like she was escorting a duchess who happened to be a word. Rill slid Grin\u2019s arm across his shoulders and took more of his weight than the other would have allowed if he had been fully present. They went back down the sideways path, and the cormorant, after a considerable pause in which it weighed the aesthetics of companionship against its cachet for solitude, unfolded its wings and followed at a distance, pretending it was coincidental.\n\nUnder the Jetty, the Assembly had put a pot on. That is the other sort of magic, the one that makes you cry with relief because someone remembered you have a stomach and a future. They ate and reported and unrolled the night and re-rolled it in better order. Poppy sat on Thatch\u2019s crate telling him very seriously about granddad\u2019s stew song and which bit was the high part. He learned it in two tries because he had been listening for lessons like that his whole life. Needle rested her head in Kettle\u2019s lap for three breaths and then got up cross because she had been kind to herself in public. Green George bound Rill\u2019s palm with a strip of an old flag from a boat that had never sunk, and the burning line on his skin went from having its own opinions to being a memory that could be kept without being caged.\n\n\u201cYou need sleep,\u201d Kettle told everyone as if she could hand it out. \u201cAnd then we need to plant nettles and apologise to an oak. And we need to consider why bad jokes have such good teeth when the wind is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we believe in endings too much,\u201d Thatch said, stroking his beard as if maps could be calmed with the correct smooth. \u201cWe tell ourselves we are smaller than we are and that endings are larger and they are not. They are just points at which someone has run out of breath. Breathe more. That\u2019s my advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy advice is to feed your enemies soup,\u201d Kettle said. \u201cIt slows them and makes them remember they have tongues for taste and not only for weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy advice is to learn funnier puns,\u201d Needle said with murderous cheer. \u201cThe ones we used tonight were a disgrace. I can find a dozen worse in the time it takes to boil a kettle. Better, I mean. Worse. You see the problem.\u201d\n\nRill looked at Grin, who had taken himself to the shadow where people stand when they know they are not welcome but cannot yet leave because the leaving would be a statement and they are not ready to be sentenced. He went over, carrying the shard-wrapped jacket carefully like an egg in a paper bag. He stopped two arm-lengths away and did not make his face kind; kindness would chafe just now.\n\n\u201cYou will say you meant to test us,\u201d he said evenly, saving Grin some effort by speaking his next three lines for him. \u201cYou will say this proved something about strength and about how laughter behaves under pressure and how you were useful. You will also say, later when you are tired and there is no one to impress, that it was beautiful and you wanted to see if beauty was bigger than attention. You can say all of those things if they help you make a shape you can wear. But hear this: you misused a key. You set an ending on the wrong hinge, and if we had not been there a child would have carried more weight than she should. There is no joke that makes that part all right.\u201d\n\nGrin\u2019s throat moved. He stared at the Jetty\u2019s stacked light as if reading something scratched on it in a hand he half remembered. \u201cIt is unbearable,\u201d he said at last, voice that thin metal some voices become when they have been used for cutting and then regret it afterward. \u201cBeing the person who is clever and wrong. It is also very funny. I will get better. Not better at being bad. Better at being precise.\u201d He looked up with something like humility lodged where his smugness lived. It would need feeding if it were to stay. \u201cWhen I ask you to pick a lock for me later, will you say no once and yes second and make me earn it.\u201d\n\nRill sighed with a long patience he had learned from rope and ruin. \u201cIf it is a lock that hurts someone, I will take your fingers off it,\u201d he said, because promises should be precise too. \u201cIf it is a lock that holds an old hurt shut and you have a new bandage in your pocket, I will pick it and tell you when to press.\u201d\n\nGrin nodded, then ruined the moment with a waggled eyebrow because he was himself and not another. \u201cI am very handsome when bandaging,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will swoon at my bedside manner.\u201d\n\nKettle threw him a chunk of bread that hit his chest with a sound that was practically a moral. He ate it because he had, despite protestations, a mouth designed for food. Around them the Jetty breathed. The ghosts slipped back into their swearwords. The map Rill had leaned against the bridge earlier rolled itself up politely and waited to be asked again on some other night.\n\nWhen dawn put its elbow on the harbour and peered in to see if everyone was decent, the Twin Sails bridge yawned and settled its pivots as if it had had a wholesome nap. The gulls took attendance and found no one missing who mattered to gulls. Rill walked Poppy home with Kettle on his quiet left and Needle on his prickly right and the cormorant above pretending it was studying a cloud. Poppy\u2019s mum stood in the doorway with an expression like a closed gate that has a gatekeeper who is also your mother. She saw sprites the way some adults can, not with her eyes but with the part of her that keeps the whole house in its head like a map.\n\n\u201cWas my girl a problem,\u201d she asked, measuring the words out like flour.\n\n\u201cShe was a solution,\u201d Kettle said, because the truth wants to be buttered. \u201cWe borrowed her no. It was returned with thanks.\u201d\n\nPoppy\u2019s mum pressed her lips together, swallowed three maternal lectures and made one instead. \u201cNo more night wandering unless you bring the walls with you,\u201d she said, then rolled her eyes at the absurdity and softened because every mother eventually has to laugh at rules to keep them fresh. \u201cCome in. There\u2019s stew left. It\u2019s better the second day, Granddad always said.\u201d She looked past them at the harbour that had decided not to be different in the essential bits. \u201cThank you,\u201d she added, not like a spell, just like a thing you say when something is given back.\n\nThey left her there in the light that comes through curtains like patient lace. Rill felt the weight of the shard in his jacket and set his steps for Brownsea. He needed to tell the grandmother oak it had been used badly and given back with apologies and to mend the cut mouth in its bark so no one could speak through it without asking. He needed to put nettles right-side-up and shake goose feathers from a fence that had been made to keep thoughts out not in. He needed to sleep for a week and would have to make do with an hour. He would mark the underside of this day with blue clay and catalogue it where the water would remember.\n\nAs they crossed the quay, the gulls tested a new joke, something about fishermen and patience, and it landed with a soggy wet. Needle groaned and Kettle laughed and Rill, a small thing made of salt and nettle and chance and an obstinacy the world had found uses for, smiled with his mouth and his hands and put a thread around the morning so it wouldn\u2019t run off before he could greet it properly. The line on his palms had stopped burning. It would scar, as everything worth telling does. He flexed his fingers and felt their particular set of skills settle like house sparrows into nests they had built themselves. There would be more cracks. There always are. There would be better jokes. That was the work. That was the bridge they would keep.\n\nBehind them, unseen because not everything needed an audience, the chalk considered the joke it had been told and tried out a new laughter, one that made ferns grow in odd places and encouraged oysters to speak to each other courteously about tides. It was not a bad laugh. It didn\u2019t break anything. It sounded like a harbour being itself under an unfussy sky. It sounded like the world refusing an ending out of sheer habit and kindness, which is the best sort of punchline to come home to at dawn.",

                              "content": "Morning wore its pale coat over the harbour and found the sprites in a boat that was in a good mood about being rowed. The water had a hangover from laughter but had decided to drink tea instead of regret, which is one of water\u2019s best habits. Rill held the shard wrapped in its makeshift silk in his lap and felt it patter against his knees like a small animal that knew its burrow was near. Kettle leaned her brazier against her hip and stirred the air now and then with the lid as if to keep flavour from clumping. Needle sat on the prow and counted gulls because numbers soothed her when jokes had been sharp, and when she lost count she hissed through her teeth and started again, which also soothed her.\n\nBrownsea received them with a courtesy it extended to guests who clean up after themselves. The north grove kept its hum close to the bark while they walked, the sound tucked like a scarf in a careful throat. When they reached the collapsed badger set, the earth had settled in a posture of embarrassment, as if it had toppled a tray at a good table and was waiting to be allowed to pick up the cutlery. Rill knelt in the dig and unrolled the silk. The shard blinked, if a piece of chalk can be said to blink, and exhaled a smell like wet stone and half-remembered songs sung at the edge of things. Kettle made a bed of nettle-rind and sand and a pinch of the blue clay taken from under the Twin Sails and murmured something that could have been a recipe if recipes called for apologies as an ingredient.\n\nThe grandmother oak heaved herself into their attention without moving and Rill bowed with his knuckles pressed to the ground because some elders prefer the earth to bear witness. He set his right palm on the cut grin and felt the cold of it still wearing a mischief that hadn\u2019t earned the right to live there. He smeared the thin coil of blue clay over the notch, pressing it into the wound the way you press paste into a child\u2019s scraped knee, firm and singing. Kettle blew pepper breath across the clay and the oak accepted the offering because it was practical, and nothing ages as well as practicality dressed decently. Needle shook iron filings along the wattle and the filings threaded themselves into the fence with the zeal of things that have found a use, and the goose feathers fell out one by one, realizing they hadn\u2019t liked being metaphors anyway.\n\nThey laid the shard back into the earth where the badgers\u2019 old rooms had been and the hum, freed from the cage of a rib, found its original octave and sat there like a kettle deciding to sing later when the kitchen was quieter. Rill\u2019s fingers hovered before he let them go, the way you hover above a sleeping creature because touch would be a theft even if it was also love. He laced a net of spider-silk over the bed and weighed the corners with smooth pebbles and an oath he made out loud so the ivy could copy it for the record. When he finished, the ground breathed and the breath did not try to be a laugh and no one anywhere mistook that for a small thing.\n\nThe squirrels came back with the casual entitlement of people who never intended to be gone long. One paused on a low branch and stared at Rill with a walnut in its mouth like a syllable it couldn\u2019t swallow without deciding what to name it, and then it ran up the oak and hid in leaves that smelled of repairs. A badger, not sleeping as cold as rumours had promised, shambled to the edge of the set, regarded the new duvet someone had made for its house, and made a noise that meant, in badger, I will not thank you in front of witnesses but I am making a note. Kettle wiped her hands on her skirt and put her head against the grandmother\u2019s bark and listened, then lifted her face and nodded as if someone had agreed to a change in the menu.\n\nWhile they worked, a thread slithered out of the shade and curled itself around Rill\u2019s left wrist with the sort of intimacy that makes you think you ought to have been consulted. It was red, not bright as a wound but old red, the colour of string kept in the back of a drawer for tying parcels to be left on porches in weather that wanted to say otherwise. Rill stared at it without moving his hands because his hands were not to be startled when they had just put a thing back where it belonged. The thread didn\u2019t tighten and it didn\u2019t slacken. It sat there with an agenda. Kettle saw it and made a face that was both I told you and also I am sorry about the telling.\n\n\u201cDoes it bite,\u201d Needle asked, because if it did she wanted to bite it first.\n\n\u201cIt binds,\u201d said a voice that had the creak of a long-lived crate and the taste of formal arrangements. Elder Thatch had not come up the path, and yet there he was, standing with his beard telling stories against his chest and his hands held in that placatory way old men hold them when they are about to announce a thing they would rather not have to enforce. Green George stood at his shoulder, looking apologetic in that way that means he had voted for the thing and then lost sleep about it anyway. \u201cIt is a Summoning Thread. It wants your name in a box where names go when the Assembly is ready to speak and the wind is not to be given the floor.\u201d\n\nRill turned his wrist so the thread saw his pulse and not his palm, which was a tiny discourtesy that threads notice. He lifted his chin a hair because small people spend half their lives learning useful heights. \u201cI hear you,\u201d he said to the thread without letting Thatch think he hadn\u2019t answered him. \u201cI have to walk a hinge to you or you\u2019ll make one for me and I won\u2019t like where it sits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d have put it at the Jetty,\u201d Thatch said, as if assuring a feral cat there was milk inside and also a door he promised not to close. \u201cThere is a matter to be spoken and we\u2019d prefer to speak it while the glass is listening and not the chalk. You can bring your friends or your enemies if that makes you feel more like yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we are coming,\u201d Kettle said with the offended domesticity of a person who intends to stand by a kettle until it boils properly. \u201cIf there is speaking about my Rill\u2019s name, we will bake that speech until it is edible.\u201d\n\nNeedle clicked her teeth and flicked a burr off her sleeve with a disgust that was disproportionate unless you had been teetering at the edge of cracks all night and needed one thing you could successfully remove. \u201cIf they are going to package him,\u201d she muttered, \u201cthey can at least let me choose the string.\u201d\n\nThey went by a path the grove opened for them because it had been taken seriously, which is all any place requires from those who pass through it. The cormorant had installed itself on a limb with the air of a critic relocated to the stalls from the gallery, and it watched their exit with a twist of head that said it would be delivering notes after the matinee. The harbour looked like a man buttoning his shirt after an argument, careful and not yet ready to smile. Rill unspooled the red thread as they walked and it paid out, not as long as it needed to be but longer than it should have been, which is the nature of summonses everywhere.\n\nUnder the Jetty of Glass, people had done the simple sacred work of sweeping and setting chairs. It is good for assemblies to start with the sound of brooms because it reminds everyone that decisions make dust. The ghosts had chosen to sit quiet for once and let the living talk, and the glass was folded over the light so that words landed and did not try to flee into the rafters. Elder Thatch climbed onto his crate and held a knot of rope at his chest like a bouquet. Green George stood with his hands in his coat and his coil at his back, and the others arranged themselves where the posts could lean against them for comfort.\n\n\u201cRill of Poole,\u201d Thatch said, and the glass scrolled the name in reflections so it felt official without being fussy. \u201cThere is a thing we have to ask, and it is not a request dressed up as a choice. It is a choice dressed up as a request because we are making it tidy to keep from being ashamed of ourselves later.\u201d\n\nRill looked at Kettle and she nodded once because her way had always been to show him the yes he could lean on if he wanted it. He looked at Needle and she mimed stabbing the air the way you stab a loaf to check if it\u2019s done and then quietly sheathed her needle because even jokes need houses. He rolled his left hand into a near-fist around the red thread to keep it from enjoying itself and spoke because silence is only noble when it does not want to be an ambush. \u201cAsk me, then, and do not sweeten it so much it sticks to my teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want you to hold a title,\u201d Thatch said, and he did not pause because pausing would let other people narrate the request with their fears. \u201cWe want you to be Keeper of the Two Ends. That is a job more than a name. It means the shard at Brownsea and the Jetty\u2019s glass will take you as a preferred route when they need to pass a warning or a hum. It means the lines that go out from this harbour and the lines that come in will have a person in them who can answer back. It means when a door is proposed, you get to test it before anyone shoves against it with a shoulder they cannot spare.\u201d\n\nGreen George lifted his hands as if to show they were empty of coercion. \u201cIt also means,\u201d he added gently, \u201cyou will be tied. Not in the way that makes a thing unable to run forever, but in the way that makes your first step always be toward us when the water is wrong. You would have to tell your hands there are places they do not lie and places they do, because some lies save and some lies are knives dressed for parties.\u201d\n\nRill did not move because there are moments when a person\u2019s whole life leans like a ladder and if you twitch the ladder falls. He felt the red thread tasting his wrist the way cats taste the edge of a bowl. He thought of the girl\u2019s no sitting polite on silk and of Grin\u2019s laugh turned mechanical inside a rib. He thought of how a harbour is not a line or a circle but a kind of cup you hold up to the weather in the hope it will pour you something you can live on. \u201cIf I say yes,\u201d he said, because good decisions always begin with ifs, \u201cI keep this hand.\u201d He lifted his left and let the thread see that it had not been given the right to choose him. \u201cI keep my liar. I will not promise to be honest where honesty is cruelty. I will promise to put a net under jokes that jump. I will promise to catalogue wishes even when I disagree with them because water prefers records. I will promise to cut lines that are cutting throats. I will not promise to be obedient if obedience is a joke told too long.\u201d\n\nThe Jetty liked that; you could hear it approve in the way the light held steady without flicker. Thatch exhaled as if he had been relieved of a knot in his gut that had been tied in a time before Rill\u2019s parents stood under any sky. \u201cI did not come here to tame you,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cThat would be a crime against salt. I came here because you already do the work and names keep the wind accountable when it tries to tell everyone that nothing happened.\u201d\n\nKettle stepped onto a crate of her own so she could look level at the old men who liked to think height had decided the question before the talking began. \u201cIf he is Keeper,\u201d she said, \u201cI am his Lid. When the pot rattles, my hand will be on it. That is not a title so much as a type of promise. Needle will be his Pin because knots can be undone and sometimes need something through them to remember their job. You can have our three for the price of one, but you must accept that we will take shifts at foolishness so it doesn\u2019t pile up.\u201d\n\nNeedle arched a brow with imperial insolence, then put her hand on Rill\u2019s shoulder with two fingers and a care that could have been a warning and was actually devotion. \u201cI do not accept your metaphor,\u201d she told Thatch, \u201cbut I accept the work. If he tethers himself to a thing with a fancy name, I get to cut the tether if it tries to hang him rather than hold him. This is not a negotiation, it is a declaration of tools.\u201d\n\nThatch laughed, and he had not laughed without weight on it in some hours, so the sound had a wheel to it. \u201cI will take three sprites and their vocabulary,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is better than many armies I have known.\u201d He lifted the rope he held and it was not rope any sprite had seen in a century; it was plaited of hair and river-reeds and bits of storm, and it was old enough to have listened to rules no one remembered writing. He offered it without advancing, which is how you offer a thing to a cat or a power. \u201cWe tie it to your name, not your neck. You can slip it if you break in half, which gives me comfort in a nasty way.\u201d\n\nRill came forward and set his right hand on the rope and his left on Kettle\u2019s wrist because it would be rude to let either think they were unconsulted. The rope was ugly and comfortable, a good combination for things that hold. He tasted ferric old rain when it touched his fingers and he did not shy away from the taste. Thatch tied two knots and then stopped and looked at Rill the way men look at a map that has offered them a short-cut and a story about a bog. \u201cThe third knot is yours to choose,\u201d Thatch said, and his voice had a wear that made it an honest gift. \u201cSquare and you will be steady. Slip and you will be quick. Figure-eight and you will be harder to crush.\u201d\n\nRill smiled, small and particular, because being asked to choose a knot is like being asked to choose a way to breathe. He caught the rope and laid an anchor bend that sailors use when they intend to leave but don\u2019t know when, a knot made for attachments that are important and temporary in the way all honest attachments are. The rope appreciated the choice; it settled against his name with a sigh like falling into the right bed at the end of the wrong day. The red thread around his wrist loosened, offended and impressed in equal measure, and lay sulking against his skin like a cat that had been invited off a counter by logic rather than by being shooed.\n\nSomething in the Jetty shifted delicately, a glassy change as if a window had been cracked the correct amount for air without drafts. Rill felt the line between shard and glass brush his spine like a tail taking his measure and he did not swat it away because you must not insult a thing you will need to ask favours of later. Green George cleared his throat and rolled his coil against his thigh until the horsehair hummed with approval, then nodded to Rill as if to say your anchor is decent and I will stop checking it for now. The ghosts murmured and one of them swore affectionately in a dialect no one living had the patience to learn, and the swear landed like a blessing.\n\nThey had not finished the talk when Grin appeared because Grin had never gotten the hang of entrances that wait for a welcome. He stood in the scrim where the Jetty\u2019s light did not quite reach and looked like someone had dressed a theory in a coat. The skin at his mouth was tender, not because he had been close to dying in a way that would make respectable people say his name softer for a bit, but because laughter used as a tool chafes even the hand that swings it. He did not try to grin and he did not pretend he was there by chance. He kept his hands out of his pockets as if he had been told once by a mother that this was how to appear harmless.\n\n\u201cIf you throw him out I will follow him and stab him in the hedge so he doesn\u2019t have to be lonely,\u201d Needle announced, which was her way of being merciful.\n\n\u201cI came to tell you the part that makes me look worse,\u201d Grin said, and there was a strange sincerity in the admission that made several barnacles consider revising their opinions of him by half a whisker. \u201cThe crack answered me because something else was listening under it. You felt it maybe as a taste of pennies or as the way your names got tight when the laugh went under them. There is a line under the chalk that isn\u2019t ours. It is very old and it has been polite because it was taught manners by rocks, which is the slowest school. I made a lever and it liked finally being asked to move.\u201d\n\nElder Thatch\u2019s beard rearranged its approvals and disapprovals and came up neutral while he thought. \u201cWe know about the old line,\u201d he said, carefully not saying its name because names make ruts and ruts are trails. \u201cIt is the seam that runs under Old Harry\u2019s bones and through the mouths of coves where people lose hats they didn\u2019t deserve. We touch it only with full pockets because it likes to take payment after you\u2019ve decided you\u2019ve paid. If it liked being asked to move, then we have offended it by assuming it would stay still for respect. That is annoying and educational.\u201d\n\nKettle exhaled a sigh that was three different household sounds braided together. \u201cSo there\u2019s an underlaugh,\u201d she said, making a new word because old ones had been used up. \u201cWe should have guessed. Bad jokes are rarely original; they are usually borrowed with worse timing.\u201d\n\nRill let the rope around his name sit and listened to the way the seam hummed now the shard was home. He could feel, like a draft through a latch, the other line Grin named, the one that lay like a sleeping eel under chalk and chalk\u2019s opinions. It had not liked being still so long that the first thing to ask it to get up was a joke. It wanted petitions, not pranks, and it would accept neither now without interest. \u201cWe will have to go find its end and politely put a stopper in the bottle,\u201d he said, and his mouth twisted because metaphors pile up and you can drown in them if you do not occasionally empty the bucket. \u201cWe\u2019ll need someone who talks rock and someone who has patience with the parts of water that prefer not to move. We\u2019ll need to stitch over Old Harry\u2019s toes with something that will not insult him.\u201d\n\nGreen George rubbed his jaw where old splinters had learned his skin and grunted approval. \u201cI have a length of lead line that has not lied in decades,\u201d he volunteered, tone humble because bragging at stones is a good way to fall off them. \u201cIt can measure depths without hurting feelings. Candle can talk to chalk because chalk thinks in candles. We will ask him to come and be useful instead of poetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlot should come,\u201d Needle said, surprising herself by complimenting a person she often called a smudge. \u201cInk knows the way words soak into porous things. He can persuade the underlaugh to take a different shape if we pour him in the right places. Also he owes me four curses and at least one apology.\u201d\n\nKettle looked toward the harbour mouth where the sea turns its head toward whatever larger thing is calling it today and frowned thoughtfully. \u201cWe will need to bring food,\u201d she said to no one in particular and to everyone at once. \u201cThe sort you can eat standing up because rocks do not like picnics and the sea has no patience for cutlery.\u201d\n\nThe Assembly unfolded into plans like a dress taken out of a trunk that smells of cedar and decisions. Rill stood with the rope around his name and did not feel captured so much as pointed, which is all a person can ask from a morning that was not promised to be simple. Poppy arrived halfway through a list of which coves sulked and which forgave and tugged on Kettle\u2019s skirt with strong little fingers, the clay bracelet now a dry band she wore with pride because something that had done work should be seen. She stood on tiptoe until Kettle bent and whispered into her ear, and Kettle laughed in a way that had spare warmth in it and kissed the top of Poppy\u2019s hood because it was rude to kiss a child who had not been asked unless you kissed the garment instead.\n\n\u201cShe says the walls at home stopped hiccuping when she told them the stew would scorch if they didn\u2019t settle,\u201d Kettle said, and Thatch had to sit down for a second because relief sometimes takes the strength from your legs like a debt paid at last. Poppy handed Rill a bottle that had once confessed to being brown glass and now had a nervous confidence. It was lined with spider exhale and smelled faintly of sugar because it had been used for cordial before and was now devoted to memory.\n\n\u201cI found a word in the drains,\u201d Poppy announced with professional pride. \u201cIt got stuck on the grill because it didn\u2019t want to go to the sea. It is a small word but it was crying in the exact way beans cry when they want more water, and I thought you would know where to put it if I brought it without tasting it myself.\u201d\n\nRill took the bottle with both hands because you take anything from a child with both hands so they can see where it went. He looked into the glass and saw the word rolled up like a mouse sleeping, and he put his ear to the mouth of the bottle and heard it say yet. He shut his eyes because there are words that, in the right morning, will fold you like a paper boat and set you down, and you must not let them see you sink for a minute because then they will feel responsible. \u201cI will put it where Grin can find it when he needs it,\u201d he said, and Grin, who had the misfortune of hearing kindness with accuracy, flinched like someone stung then warmed like someone granted a blanket against his own taste.\n\nIt was later than it felt when they let the Jetty rest. The day had decided to be ordinary with a stubbornness that lashed itself to mast and axle. Rill carried the bottle with the yet in it tucked at his hip and the rope knot on his name sat easy as a song you\u2019ve remembered three days late and found that it fits the step you are taking now. Kettle went ahead with a list of foodstuffs that looked like a prayer and sounded like logistics, and Needle stomped beside her making grooved plans into which puns could safely fall without bruising the passengers. Grin drifted at Rill\u2019s shoulder with the lightness of a person trying not to ask for escort and Rill, who had learned to be less stupid than his enemies, let his step match without announcing it aloud.\n\nThey made it as far as the quay before the harbour sent them a message the old way, which is to say with a bottle that had not asked to be a messenger and was now irreversibly devoted. It knocked against the pilings under the Jetty with the persistence of a child who knows there is cake and has not been told otherwise. Needle fished it out with her needle because that is an elegant thing to do, and Kettle flicked the drop of water off the cork with the contempt of a woman whose kitchen floor is her friend only when dry. Rill took the bottle and rolled it in his hands until whatever last word was sleeping there woke up and showed its tail.\n\nThis one was not a last word. It was a map\u2019s breath, a thread of river drawn wrong on paper. It tasted like iron and faint chalk and a shame that had been told to mind itself in public. Rill held it to his ear and listened without speaking because there are times to let a thing tell you what it thinks it is before you tell it what it is for. The breath said a channel had gone missing. Weller\u2019s Channel, the skinny vein that fishermen used to swear by and then forget in November when fog pretended to be a theology, had shrugged and slipped sideways.\n\n\u201cChannels do not get lost,\u201d Green George said from behind them with an impatience he wore on good days to hide worry. \u201cThey sulk. That is different. Lost implies someone had a map in their pocket and then lent their coat to a man who did not check his lining.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis one fell in love with the wrong laugh and followed it,\u201d Rill said, because he could feel the absence like when a loose tooth will not stop making a tongue a hypochondriac. \u201cOr it was told it could be an ending and believed the compliment. We will have to speak to it before the tide convinces it to try being a bay, and then we will have a foolishness that looks like elegance for generations.\u201d\n\nKettle set her brazier down with a thump that suggested it had opinions and she agreed with half of them. \u201cEat first,\u201d she ordered, because these were her people and that was the law that kept them clever instead of mere. \u201cThen we go pin a channel to its name and ask Old Harry to be generous with anyone who begs while silly. Poppy, you go home and tell your mother there will be stew again tomorrow and you very much intend to stop wandering without walls.\u201d\n\nPoppy made a face that was both obedient and dramatic, and Kettle hugged her hood because mothers who are not yours sometimes get to do that, and Rill knelt and let Poppy pat the bottle at his hip because small people deserve to confirm the location of their yet. The child ran away in the precise pattern of steps that keeps small feet from being noticed by large trouble, and the sprites stood together with sea in their ears and rope in their futures and a laugh they had taught to behave sullenly for the moment.\n\nThey ate on crates with their heels knocking against salt and their talk indistinguishable to anyone who did not speak the language of people who hold things together by habit. Rill put the word yet in his mouth like a sweet he didn\u2019t deserve and tried not to bite it so he could save it for later. Grin sat with his back to a post because even he knew where to put himself when he wanted the room to ignore him kindly, and when Needle nudged him she did it with her foot, which is how you say I have forgiven enough for today without using your mouth. The Jetty listened for a while and then decided to practice being glass for when the next crack asked if anyone was home, and the harbour pulled its shirt straight and planned its evening with an optimism you could pour a day into if you kept your hand steady.\n\nBy the time the tide turned in earnest, the plan had more legs than a spider and fewer than a millipede, which is the correct amount for plans with sea in them. They would go to Old Harry with lead line and ink and candle and ask the underlaugh for a bargain in the old words that chalk respects. They would fetch Weller\u2019s Channel back and stitch it so it remembered what being a channel had to offer that being a bay did not. They would set signs where the laughter had tried to make itself a road and label them with warnings that could be mistaken for jokes if you were in the wrong mood and needed to be indulged. They would watch Grin not because they wanted to catch him but because he liked to be supervised when he had agreed to try to be good.\n\nRill rose, feeling the rope on his name like a cat on his lap that had decided it would allow itself to be carried for a bit if the scenery changed. He looked at Kettle, whose hair had more weather in it than any sky deserved, and at Needle, whose fingers wanted to pick a fight with a horizon, and at Green George, who had coils and patience, and at Elder Thatch, who had a beard that could store winter. He looked at Grin, who was the sort of person you must look at and then remember to blink because staring rewards him. He looked at the harbour, which was his, and he looked at the chalk, which wasn\u2019t but tolerated him, and he let the map sing softly at his hip because it needed to.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, and the word did not have to be loud to reach the places that wanted to hear it. \u201cLet us go find the end of a thing that thinks it is an ending and remind it it is only ever a turn.\u201d He flexed his fingers and the burns on his palms chimed like old coins, and he smiled with his mouth and his hands and his odd, knotted heart, because he had been asked to keep two ends and that meant he would always have something to hold.",

                              "content": "They went out on the turn, when the harbour took two steps back like a dancer making room for a better move. The skiff that let them last night was sulking, so Green George bribed a squat, tar-bellied launch with the smell of horsehair and an old shanty hummed under his breath. It nosed away from the quay with the obstinate grace of boats that think they know the harbour better than you do. Candle arrived late and effortless, as if he had been standing in the wick of a shadow the whole time. He was not lit because that would have been rude in a morning, but he smelled faintly of bees and libraries, and when he breathed you could see the air consider staying. His cap had a stub of wick poking through like a thought he was saving for when people would be grateful to hear it.\n\nBlot clambered in with his ledger tucked to his ribs and a bottle of black that did not slosh but considered its own gravity whenever the boat leaned. His fingers were stained the way a map is, with intention and accident. He coughed as if he had swallowed a punctuation mark and waved off Kettle\u2019s look with the long-suffering dignity of people whose work stains them. \u201cIt comes off if you die,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cPreferably not today.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreferably never,\u201d Kettle said, and she tucked a lidded tin down among the coiled rope where soup could maintain the fiction of being a spell and a spell could hold the delusion of being soup. Needle took the prow as if it had snubbed her once and she was granting it the favour of her weight. Grin sat on the thwart with his coat buttoned wrong and his expression set to penitent despite his eyebrows\u2019 wish to be outrageous. Rill stood for a breath, letting the rope around his name settle itself, then sat where he could lay one hand on the gunwale and feel the water move with opinions under the paint.\n\nThey rode the harbour out like a sentence written with care. Old Harry\u2019s white shoulders showed themselves in daylight the way chalk always does, proud and crumbly, already writing their own erasures. Candle lifted his face to them like a parishioner remembering the words to a hymn. \u201cHe is old in the way that is not polite to remark upon,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut he likes to be admired and he will forgive us anything if we let him explain the weather to us for twenty minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more than weather,\u201d Needle said, pushing hair out of her eyes with a hand that had mastered annoyance. \u201cWe need his seam. We need his private line. We need to ask him to send his eel back under the table while we eat.\u201d\n\nCandle smiled with the patience of someone upon whom doors open because he never presumes to knock loudly. \u201cHe does not call it a seam,\u201d he said, and the boat shivered softly as if something trailing beneath had heard the capital letter and lifted an ear. \u201cHe calls it his thought. Chalk thinks very slowly, but when it does it is in long lines. He has a thought under him. You startled it with a joke and now it is trying to finish a sentence that has waited three hundred summers for a predicate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will give it one,\u201d Rill said. He drew the map onto his knees and let it sing low and domestic, the way a cat sings when it thinks you have not noticed it brought you a moth. The map\u2019s breath slid up around Old Harry\u2019s printed outline and hummed there, excited and uncertain. He put two fingers on Weller\u2019s Channel and felt the absence like a bruise. It had gone thin and sideways, as if it had been embarrassed by its own usefulness and decided to take up less space.\n\nGreen George stood to cast the lead and the boat scowled at him but made room because lead lines demand courtesies learned when ships were young. The plummet hit the water like a full stop and fell with an authority that made the weeds step aside. George paid out the line with both hands, calling the marks under his breath as if gossiping with depth. \u201cBy the mark five. And then a sulk. By the deep eight farther on. She\u2019s shifted her skirts, the minx.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe followed a laugh,\u201d Blot said dryly. He uncorked his bottle and let a thin thread of ink dribble into the tide. It did not spread; it behaved like a wire, sinking and drawing a neat line through the water that fish would later follow for the pleasure of pretending to be on a road. \u201cI\u2019ll mark the path she took so we can mark the path we will ask. Channels like flattery dressed as instruction. We will give her both.\u201d\n\nThe launch grumbled around Old Harry\u2019s white knees and slid into the wind\u2019s blind spot. The chalk was loud without making noise; the cliffs held the sound of their own collapse the way old people hold anecdotes about storms. Candle stood, took off his cap, and bowed to rock. He did it with the right amount of humour, as if he knew how ridiculous such bows look to people who cannot hear stone, and as if he did not care. \u201cGood morning, Harold,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cYou are looking crisp.\u201d\n\nThe cliff, which does not deign to turn its head, turned its attention. The sky on this side of the boat felt different, as if it had acquired weight. Candle spoke in a tone Rill had heard from women sitting too near ovens and speaking sense through steam. \u201cYou have a thought exposed,\u201d he went on. \u201cIt is not a shame. Thoughts must breathe. But this one has its shoelaces undone and the tide is a thief. Will you let us tie it for you while you finish, and then untie it when you are ready to speak the long word.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least he tells you what he is doing,\u201d Needle muttered to the cliff, which had opinions about needling and did not disapprove. Grin closed his mouth with visible effort and pressed his lips together until his grin had nowhere to sit. Kettle ladled out spoons of soup and set them on the thwart for the wind to consider, because generosity is often a better opening gambit than compliments.\n\nThe chalk replied the way chalk does. A bit flaked near a cormorant\u2019s foot, a rivulet of dust traced an old channel down, the boat trembled as a wave that had not been signalled elsewhere by wind riffled its skin. Candle nodded and translated for those who did not speak rumour-through-stone. \u201cHe says we are not wrong that a thought has its shoe undone. He says it has been listening to things it does not understand, and also to things it understands too well. He says he will not have us telling him he is in danger like he is a child, because he is not, and that he will allow us to sit and knit in his porch while he continues his thinking, provided we do not drop our needles where he keeps his fossils.\u201d\n\nRill grinned because there is no better yes than a cranky one. He turned the map so the printed cliff and the cliff itself could see each other out of the corners of their eyes. He set Green George\u2019s lead line across the chart like a vein. He glanced at Kettle and she set the tin by Candle\u2019s feet with a respectful thunk and began to hum Poppy\u2019s granddad\u2019s stew song very softly, the kind of hum that convinces a kitchen the hour is decent. The Jetty\u2019s silk with the no was wrapped away like a sacrament, but he felt its knot in his pocket like a coin he did not plan to spend unless the world shoved.\n\nBlot wet his finger in the ink and drew a sigil on the map that had no magic to it at all unless you count hands that have done it many times as magic, which you should. It was a net with wide eyes and kind knots, the sort that lets small fish pass and keeps boats from being stupid. \u201cFor Weller,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is shy. We tell her she is not a road, she is a ribbon. We tell her ribbons have important work keeping things pretty and together. We tell her she looks nicer straight.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not tell her she looks nicer,\u201d Kettle warned, wagging her spoon with the firmness of someone who has dealt with too many hearts for one lifetime. \u201cTell her she looks like herself when she is where she knows she is. Coaxing is good. Flattery is a spice you use after the stew is cooked and not a minute sooner.\u201d\n\nGreen George cast again and called out the old words, and the chalk sighed at being counted and slightly admired the rigour. The boat settled into a rhythm. Candle spoke to Harold about wind that came from the wrong direction three summers ago and left a taste like pennies. Harold responded by letting a flake fall near Candle\u2019s shoe in agreement. Needle, who had the patience of a person who has had to use other people\u2019s patience as a tool, did not stab the sea. She watched Weller\u2019s Channel with her eyes narrowed until she could see not where it was but where it wanted to be, which is what true sight is for. Grin did not speak. The restraint sat on him like a cat on a cushion just barely tolerating the cushion\u2019s pattern.\n\nThe underlaugh was there. Rill could feel it, that eel of thought under chalk, curled tight and pleased with being tickled. It had liked being asked to move by a lever that was not fit for it. It had enjoyed, for the first time in an age, a wickedness it had not invented. It was going to be difficult to tell it that wickedness made a mess and someone would have to clean if it got mud on all the floors. He put his palms on the cool lip of the boat and spoke in his chest because sometimes things under stone prefer vibrations to sound. \u201cWe do not come to stop you thinking,\u201d he told the seam in a cadence only Candle and a gull bothered to hear. \u201cWe come to show you a better joke. The one we carry is not about ends. It is about turns. It is about yet. It is an honest word. It tastes of stew and weather that is improving. Will you try it as a hinge for the while.\u201d\n\nThe underlaugh uncurled like a ribbon taken from a drawer where it had been kept for weddings and deaths. It slid up under the hull. The boat rose a fingerbreadth and stayed there. Candle lowered his lids, hearing slow stone change its mind about an adjective. Green George frowned, listening to the lead line tell him that a place that had been eight was now eight-but-cheerful. Blot dipped his brush and flicked a letter of yet into the water. It did not dissolve. It wobbled into a shape the chalk would recognise when it thought about weather next.\n\n\u201cWeller,\u201d Kettle said at the same time, and her voice went sideways under the boat the way taste goes sideways on your tongue when you think about vinegar. \u201cYou are not missing. You are sulking. Stop it. We love you. It is unbecoming to be loved and be missing at the same time when fishermen could break their ankles on your mistake.\u201d She ladled a circle of soup into the tide like a halo. \u201cCome here and eat.\u201d The circle drifted and then sat as if the water had suddenly learned table manners.\n\nChannels have ears when they choose, and this one had always been soft for Kettle because she had scolded it once when it was young and called it by its name without making it a shrine. The water darkened in a line no wider than a reasonably ambitious ribbon, and Rill felt a tug in his hands that was nothing like rope and everything like rope. He put two fingers on the map and three into the air, tying the one to the other with a thought so practised it let him breathe while he did it. Weller\u2019s Channel slid back into its old bed with the relief of a child returning to a favourite chair after trying to sit like an adult at a table too high.\n\n\u201cMark it,\u201d Blot said, and he lifted his brush. The ink did not spread; it sank and threaded itself through the water in a cord that would last as long as they asked if they asked it politely every morning and there was tea. Green George sang two marks and a prayer and the lead line agreed with both. Needle tied a little nothing on the air over the channel that would catch in fishermen\u2019s eyeballs and make them think, aye, there, without knowing why. Kettle tasted the soup in the halo and nodded because nourishment is all geometry in the end.\n\nUnder them, the underlaugh tasted yet. It did not accept it as a meal because it is older than meals and refuses to be fashionable, but it let the word sit on its tongue. The taste distracted it from the seductive memory of the end Grin had offered. It did not turn away. It turned aside. Candle put his palm on the launch\u2019s plank and made a small sound in his throat that might have been a hymn fragment or the remembered cough of a winter hearth. \u201cHarold says thank you by not saying it,\u201d he reported. \u201cHe says the new word is lacklustre and wholesome, which is a compliment in chalk. He says if we will please refrain from carving any more mouths in oaks he will consider not laughing at cliffs for a fortnight to give everyone\u2019s tiles a chance to sit in their mortar properly.\u201d\n\nGrin snorted and then made the sound into a cough because making fun of gratitude is a bad habit that ruins bread. He leaned over the side and looked down into water that had decided to be obedient without being servile. \u201cI have a suggestion,\u201d he offered, with the caution of a man holding a match over a hammock. \u201cWe take the yet and we write it where the laugh would go if it came back. We do not nail it in. We hang it like a coat on a peg. The underlaugh will see the peg and remember it has somewhere to put its coat. Then when it wants to go to a party it will at least dress properly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour metaphors are late for work,\u201d Needle said, but she did not dismiss the idea. \u201cBlot can write the word under the lip where only chalk and fish will read it. Candle can translate the coat-peg. George can measure the impertinence. Kettle can feed the coat because nothing behaves on an empty stomach. Rill can\u2026\u201d She paused, because she hated admitting she did not know a thing already. \u201cRill can tie the peg.\u201d\n\nRill laughed softly, which the chalk permitted because it was not a destructive laugh. He took the silk from his pocket and showed the knot that held Poppy\u2019s practical no. He did not untie it because you do not undress a promise to ask it to do tricks. He tied a small sister knot alongside, pale and similar, with the memory of yet in it and the shape of a hook with no barb. Blot dipped his brush and wrote the word in a script fish admire, under the lip of a ledge where crabs would read it and yawn and keep the secret out of boredom. Candle spoke to the chalk with vowels shaped like patience, and Green George declared himself satisfied with a number that would have been rude to announce aloud, so he patted the lead line apology into its fibers until it forgave him for silence.\n\nThe boat sighed like a person who has been sent to collect a parcel and found three instead. The wind let them alone for a minute in the way wind does when it admits it has been overeager. Weller\u2019s Channel stretched under their hull and rolled its shoulders. The underlaugh curled back under chalk and took the word with it the way a dog takes a glove to worry under a table later when no one is crying. Old Harry dropped a flake that landed point-first on Candle\u2019s cap and stuck there like a blessing with a sense of humour.\n\n\u201cSoup,\u201d Kettle announced, because the boat\u2019s mood had changed and she knew better than anyone that this is when a person falls over because they think the work is done. She handed spoons and did not wait to see if people would take them, because even the naughty eat when commanded by competence. Needle ate with austere diligence. Green George ate like a man who agreed with weather. Blot got ink on his spoon and then pretended he had meant to. Candle took three sips and sighed in a way that made the cliff more sentimental than it liked to be and made it pretend to cough. Grin ate, which was new enough to be notable, and when Kettle raised an eyebrow he jutted his chin. \u201cI can consume without performing,\u201d he said, and then added meekly, \u201cSometimes.\u201d\n\nThey went about the rest of the business that morning gives you when you ask without modesty. Rill checked the map for how the laugh had tried to creep into lanes and found the little places where it still pestered brick. Needle wrote down on her cuff the names of three groynes that had volunteered for buoy duty before they thought about splinters. Green George promised buoys. Blot made a note in his ledger that a channel had been retrieved with dignity, and he capped his bottle with a flourish that would read as modesty in the minutes. Candle tucked Harold\u2019s complaint about last winter\u2019s frost into his cap like a shopping list. Kettle wiped the ladle clean on the inside of the tin because that is a spell too.\n\nThey were turning the boat for home when the sea sent them an envelope. It came not in a bottle but in a raft of bladderwrack that had decided to be useful. The weed bumped against the hull and would not let go until Rill leaned down and accepted from it a packet of cold, which is how the sea writes to people it suspects will not misuse adjectives. He held the cold in his hands until it understood it had been heard, then opened it and allowed it to become words. The words were from the west, where the chalk thins and the mud begins to win arguments. They smelled of peat and iron and something like a smile you do not trust.\n\n\u201cSandbanks,\u201d Green George guessed before Rill could speak, because men who know harbours keep the list of likely braggarts near the front of their minds.\n\nRill shook his head and tasted again. \u201cNo. Studland. The heaths,\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cThey have not liked their fires lately. They say a laugh ran through their gorse last year and left splinters that itch when the wind is east. They think it heard today\u2019s, and it is up now, pacing. They ask us whether we mean to keep cheerfulness inside its fence.\u201d\n\nCandle grimaced, the way candles do when someone tries to use them to burn a house down. \u201cGorse does not like underlaughs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt holds its own laughter dear. It will set itself on fire to teach underlaughs manners. That is not the method I would choose on a weekday.\u201d\n\nKettle put the lid on the soup tin with a firm little click. \u201cWe will go,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cAfter we take Weller home and after I replace the clay under Twin Sails, and after Poppy is told she may not wear the walls as a cape in winter. We will bring water to the gorse because it will take it from me and not you, and we will tell jokes that make shrubs behave. Needle can bring the nasty puns. They are a tonic. Grin will not even open his mouth. I will sew it if I must.\u201d\n\nGrin put his hands up, which is a gesture of surrender made by people who plan to examine the bars of their jail for comedic potential. \u201cI will be mute as a volume of sermons in a pub,\u201d he said sweetly, and then spoiled it by making a face at Candle, who gave him a look you could boil soup on.\n\nThey slid the boat back toward Poole with the tide under them like a hand. The harbour\u2019s bruise was already fading, though the place would ache for a bit when it rained. Rill felt the rope on his name stretch and settle with the sort of satisfaction a person feels when their house has acquired a new shelf in precisely the spot a mug had always wanted to occupy. He looked at the faces around him, all of them built for different kinds of holding, and the soft, necessary ache that comes after a thing is not broken any longer knocked twice under his ribs. He put his palm on the map and let it hum to sleep, which it did with relief, because maps like to be closed when everyone knows where they are.\n\nUnder the Jetty of Glass, the ghosts had set out mugs. The Assembly did not swarm; it leaned, the way it does when it expects news from people it trusts. Rill lifted the lead line and let the plummet knock the planks twice, which is how you tell fishermen as ghosts that the tide has agreed to be sensible and they may go sleep without worrying that they will have to turn in their nets in the morning because a channel has gone missing. Thatch nodded gravely and the rope on his arm agreed, and for a moment the room was merely a room with people in it who had done a task and came back alive, which is the best use of a room.\n\nPoppy had been consigned to domesticity by a mother whose eyes had shadows in them like spare warnings, and so there was no small person underfoot to remind them all how easy certain words are. Kettle wrote a note with steam on Thatch\u2019s crate for the child\u2019s kitchen to find later, a recipe for no that involved butter and not being sorry. Needle sharpened her needle even though it did not need sharpening, because readiness tastes better than appetite when you have to go back out. Blot licked a thumb and smoothed ink that had lifted where a gull had been nosy. Candle set his cap with its flake of chalk on a nail and covered it with a cloth because respect is an outfit you keep clean.\n\nGreen George coiled his lead line like a contented snake, then let it sit unworried on the floor as if to say there, we know how deep you are for today. Rill set the bottle with the yet where Grin would pretend not to notice it and then, when he did notice, pretend not to know it was for him. Grin, to his credit, looked, pretended nothing, and tucked the bottle into his own coat like a promise he had signed for and did not intend to default on in public. He was very quiet and this time the quiet did not feel like wait-for-it, but like I am trying in the clumsy way of those who learned late.\n\n\u201cI have to go apologise to an oak and not be ridiculous about it,\u201d Rill said, and the Jetty\u2019s light rustled over him like a page turned with affection. \u201cThen we will pack jokes that shrubs tolerate and water that remembers rain. We will probably sing, which is alarming. After that, if the world wants an ending again, we will fling yet at it until it agrees to be a turn.\u201d He rubbed his palms unconsciously, and the rope on his name thrummed once against his skin as if it had laughed in private.\n\n\u201cDo not be late,\u201d Thatch said, indicating nothing and everything with two fingers and his beard. \u201cThe day intends to be long and will not be insulted if you get to the hard bits before lunch.\u201d\n\nThey split like sensible water at a keel, each to their preparations and the small repairs work leaves behind. Rill and Kettle took the sideways path because it was the shortest, and Needle Shadowed them with the particular offence of a person who has decided to be present for everything out of sheer policy. The harbour made itself a place behind their backs with the satisfaction of a dog turning in a bed it has decided to keep. From the chalk edge, a flake let go deliberately and fell, not as an ending but as a note in a song that had been waiting for a bar to fill. The wind got over itself. The channels checked their names. The gulls, having briefly entertained better jokes, returned to their traditional repertoire with dignified relief.\n\nThe grandmother oak of the Old Copse received their apology with the uncomplicated generosity of entities that outlast grudges. Rill pressed his forehead to the repaired bark and listened to it breathe around the blue clay like a mended pot saucepan sings when it has been fixed by someone who will cook with it the next day. He told it what had happened in words that contained their own mending and promised it a nettle bed thick enough to make the wrong mouths keep their distance. Kettle scattered nettle seeds with the tidy ferocity of someone setting out spoons for a wake. Needle stood guard in case Grin\u2019s name slipped through a syllable and tried to be clever where oaks preferred steadiness.\n\nOn their way to Studland, they caught sight of Grin where the quay makes a corner out of gossip and rope, conversing with Poppy across the demarcation line that all good mothers draw in the air when they have to let their child talk to danger without making a fuss. He was holding the bottle with yet in both hands the way you hold a small animal that will not forgive you for dropping it. Poppy\u2019s hood ears were cocked and her eyebrows were in their I am a good student posture. Kettle made a noise that meant she approved without being pleased. Rill slowed for half a breath and heard Grin say, with peculiar care, \u201cWhen you have a good no, keep it where you can reach it. Other people will want to borrow it. You may lend it. But you do not have to. Make them bring soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuh,\u201d Poppy said again, but she smiled, not cruelly, and Rill decided hope was not a mad craft even in harbours that had laughed in the wrong key two hours ago.\n\nStudland\u2019s heaths lay out like a rumpled blanket someone had kicked off in their sleep in the middle of a dream about fire. Gorse bristled obscene sunshine, broom flung up arms waiting for spring even when spring had gone to lunch, and the sandy paths remembered the feet of soldiers and brides and dogs with a democracy that would have made parliaments blush. The underlaugh that had been teased into waking westward was different here; it had learned a new hiss that involved dry stems and the whisper of something that had never liked being told it was beautiful. The air tasted like the inside of old tea tins, metallic and cozy and cross.\n\nKettle took the front because shrubs respond to authority the way kettles do. She had a bucket, which the heaths respected as a sort of priest, and a rag slung over her shoulder because there are always spills. Candle walked just behind her, eyes soft in that way that tells land you are listening to the story it tells itself to be itself. Blot carried his bottle of ink as if heath would forgive a stain if the proper penitent took responsibility for it. Green George had rope that grass likes; it does not chafe and it understands that it is a path only as long as it is asked. Needle had a bag filled with false starts and groans, which are the tools of pun warfare. Rill held the map rolled, because land does not like to be shown its picture unless asked nicely, and because the rope around his name had begun to hum in the precise pitch that meant the ground was already thinking about lines.\n\nThey stepped onto the first path and it muttered under its breath about deer. Kettle splashed a spoonful of water onto the path and it calmed, because water is the proper answer to most resentments that involve dust. On their right, a flare of yellow in the gorse looked indecently cheerful. Grin sucked air through his teeth and had the decency to say nothing at all. Candle cleared his throat and talked about fog in November and the way it makes the world kind because it insists on holding everything gently until you remember you are lost.\n\nThe underlaugh edged in, shy and provocative both, like a cat that wants a hand and will scratch if you do it wrong. It moved through the gorse in a sibilant flirtation, looking for the particular place where dry jokes turn to bad fires. Rill felt it and put his palm down, five fingers to earth. He did not try to tie it because you do not put knots on tinder. He spoke into his hand instead and offered the joke they had hung under the chalk, the yet with its hookless peg. The heaths listened, suspicious and tempted. Kettle set her bucket down and scooped water with her hand, flicking it into the air so the droplets became a string of pearls too pretty for flame to embarrass itself by licking. Needle told a joke about a broom who thought it was a match and was ashamed when it discovered its true purpose was to tidy up after other people\u2019s drama. The gorse laughed raucously at the broom, which is how you get gorse to let go of a plan to set itself on fire.\n\nBlot wrote on air with a wet brush so that when the underlaugh tried to run it banged its shins on letters and fell into a punctuation that did not hurt anyone. Green George set a line down across path and path lifted its skirts and stepped over it primly, thereby losing momentum, which is how you prevent tragedy at walking speed. Candle spoke to the heather the way you talk to a proud aunt, reminding it of winters borne and summers improved. Kettle sang Poppy\u2019s no at a gorse bush that had begun to whisper set me alight and the bush lost its nerve and offered bees instead.\n\nThey were progressing, which is to say they were not on fire and the underlaugh was breathing through its nose instead of its mouth, when Grin, who had been mute longer than was good for him, stepped on a patch of sand that remembered soldiers and spoke from the soles of his feet without meaning to. It was a clever little sound, the sort you could slip any number of meanings into, and the underlaugh, which loves a double meaning more than sin loves leisure, snapped toward it like a ferret. Kettle spun and threw a wet rag directly at Grin\u2019s face and the rag smacked him with all the dignity of a matron correcting a boy at table. He blinked, sputtered, and for once laughed at himself like a man and not a trick, and the underlaugh inched away, confused by an appetite turned inward that had not eaten anyone else.\n\n\u201cCarry that,\u201d Kettle said coolly, pointing at the rag, \u201cand if you open your mouth without my permission you put the rag in it first.\u201d\n\nGrin bowed, wet and chastened, and put the rag between his teeth and grimaced and made no effort at heroism. The heaths respected this, because they had mothers more exacting than weather. Candle put his hand flat on the sandy patch and apologised to the soldiers who used to turn here. Needle whispered a pun so bad it unmanned three patches of broom and made them drop their seed; Blot gulped a laugh and choked on it and then chose a better place to put it. Rill kept speaking yet into the places where he felt the word tip back toward end, balancing it, the way a person balances a tray of cups across a slanting deck.\n\nThey reached a hollow where gorse had already scorched itself months ago in a tantrum and cooled into charcoal that remembered everything. Kettle sat on a scar and set the bucket between her knees and talked to it about soup. The underlaugh curled there, resentful and comforted, like a story that had been told too many times and now wanted to be sung. Candle coaxed it with vowels he had borrowed from old chalk. Green George put a line around the hollow so the bad idea could not go visit the next one without stepping over a rope that would remind it of manners. Blot painted yet against the underside of a charred branch and the branch said, in the language of crack and patience, that it would try.\n\nRill\u2019s palms ached again, but it was not the ache of burning. It was the ache of carrying a basket too full of fruit because it is all ripe at once and you cannot bear to leave any of it on the ground where it will rot. He rubbed his thumbs together and in the friction felt the rope on his name hum in contentment. He thought of Poppy, of Harold, of Weller sliding back into her bed like a sigh, and of the stew they would eat when they had finished making sure laughter did not mistake itself for flame. He allowed himself, for a dangerous minute, to believe that this was what days were for.\n\nThen from the west, past the mouth that is not a mouth, under the cove that likes other people\u2019s hats more than is decent, the sea sent them a different shape of cold. It was tighter, metal-faced, of a sort that lives under schedules and whistles and blue uniforms. It smelled of oil and decision and a little of old paper stamped with approvals. The harbour had breathed in. The Twin Sails complained anew. The Patrol had looked down.\n\n\u201cThey are seeing more than they want,\u201d Needle said, snapping her head toward town as if she could unsee on their behalf. \u201cIf they see us, we will be a joke the present cannot forgive. If they do not see us, they will see something else and make a bad rule.\u201d\n\nKettle stood and picked up her bucket with a noise like a gavel in an agreeable court. \u201cWe finish here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe go home handsome. We teach the Patrol a no that is not a child\u2019s and not a door\u2019s. We give them yet, because bureaucracies love a postponement more than truth.\u201d\n\nGrin spat the rag into his hand with a wet slap, tucked it under his belt with a sense of theatre he did not squander, and looked at Rill with a face not even he could ruin. \u201cLet me speak,\u201d he asked, and Kettle drew breath to forbid him and he drew his wet rag out and stuffed it into his mouth again and mumbled through it, \u201cWith a mouth full of propriety.\u201d He plucked the bottle at his chest where yet waited without pride. \u201cI can sell delay to clocks.\u201d\n\nCandle considered and then inclined his head, granting permission as if he were the one who had it to give and thereby making it true. \u201cIf you can make the Patrol laugh in the right place,\u201d he warned, \u201cyou will have done a dangerous service. Mind your hinges.\u201d\n\nThey finished binding the underlaugh to a better appetite with the tidy finality of women closing up a pantry. The gorse looked less like it wanted to be a sermon and more like it wanted to be a hedge again. The broom lifted its lances with a sigh that sounded like gossip. The heaths let them go with the air of a house that has been put in order and can now afford to be messy in private. They took the path not because it was shortest but because it existed, which is sometimes the best reason. The wind had gone off to meddle elsewhere and the sun let them be seen in pieces on the sandy track, because no one minding their own business benefits from sharp outlines.\n\nWhen they reached the Jetty, the Patrol were there in their boat with the blue that says we mean to be helpful without being interested in your opinion. The craft rocked under men who were doing their jobs by leaning; their hands were on rails, on radios, on an authority that had been given to them by people who could not know the right sounds to make when chalk laughs. Their eyes were tired even when they were young. One of them had soup on his jacket and was embarrassed about it. The Twin Sails stood with its arms in their proper places, but there was a stiffness in its shoulder bolts like a person trying not to show you they had been crying recently.\n\nThe sergeant on the Patrol\u2019s bow, a woman with a mouth that could pry a misdeed out of a conger eel, saw Kettle and looked past her more than at her, which is how seeing works when you are not allowed to. \u201cYou lot,\u201d she said to the Jetty, to the ghosts, to the parts of the day that would later be written as wind. \u201cDid you feel that. We had reports. Cracks. Laughter in the foundations. A child with a torch. Don\u2019t tell me stories. Tell me where to put cones.\u201d\n\nRill stepped up because it was a work for hands and voices both and because his rope tugged lightly on his name and said you are the presentable one. Grin was behind him with the rag at the ready like penance. Kettle stood at his shoulder with a bucket and the unarguable expression of useful people. Needle bristled like a nettle that has just been asked to please be less itself. Candle took up a place in a patch of light and prepared to be ignored, which is the best place from which to alter the course of an afternoon.\n\n\u201cPut cones,\u201d Rill said pleasantly, \u201caround Weller\u2019s Channel at low tide because she is returning to good habits and will need encouragement to think of herself as a path. Put cones on the north end of the Twin Sails where someone has been throwing wishes too hard and the bridge\u2019s feelings were bruised. Put cones in your men\u2019s ears when they think to shout at children; make them ask nicely. And if you have cones spare, put them on the path up by the Old Copse until I have apologised to an oak and mended a fence. After that your cones may be redeployed to wherever you most like cones because we will have finished with them.\u201d\n\nThe sergeant stared, and the rope on Rill\u2019s name hummed power in a frequency that makes decision-makers think of retirement with fondness. It was not magic. It was tone. It was also a man with ink-scarred fingers standing attentively behind Rill, a man with a coil of lead line, a woman with a brazier, a needle-witch disguised as a child\u2019s toy, and a candle that was not lit because that would have been an admission. The sergeant\u2019s mouth twitched toward humour in the corner, as if a joke was trying to find its way up through her training and had decided to come back later. \u201cAnd you are,\u201d she said blandly, because names are tools and she had learned not to pick up what wasn\u2019t hers.\n\n\u201cA person,\u201d Kettle said briskly, saving everyone time, \u201cwho is telling you that if you put cones where I said you will not be mending things in a hurry tomorrow. If you do not put cones where I said, you will be mending more expensive things. Your choice is either competence or budget. I assume you prefer competence, because your jacket has soup on it and that means someone loves you at home.\u201d\n\nThe sergeant lifted a hand to her jacket and found the smear and looked the tiniest bit betrayed by fortune, then let the betrayal be an ally. She glanced at the bridge as if to ask it whether it had been misused, thought better, and looked back at the people who were politely not people. \u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cCones. Weller\u2019s. North end. Old Copse. Shouting at children is discouraged by the manual as well as decency. Consider it done.\u201d She paused, then added, in a lower tone that pretended to be an aside to the Jetty, \u201cAnd the laughing.\u201d\n\nGrin lifted the bottle of yet without flourish and handed it to Rill like a scalpel. Rill uncorked it with a thumb and held it near the sergeant\u2019s radio aerial. The word slid out like steam and sat on the metal with the weight of a promise. For a moment the radio did not crackle because radio knows when it has been given the equivalent of a biscuit and wants to behave in case there is another. \u201cIf the laugh comes back,\u201d Rill said, watching the sergeant as the word behaved, \u201csay yet three times in a line, not a list, with patience for the first reply. It will not stop it because we are not in the business of stopping laughter. It will make it turn its head and then you can set your cones where they will be useful. It will feel like nothing and it will be the difference between your men going home cross and going home cross and broken.\u201d\n\nThe sergeant\u2019s mouth did a thing only one person standing there noticed, because only Candle had the training to see a mouth agree while the rest of a face obeys protocol. She turned to her crew and spoke three orders in an economical tone that made the boat sit up and handle like a promise. When she turned back she had no humour left in her mouth because this was not where she would use it. She nodded to Kettle like two generals who had discovered they had the same mother, and then they were moving, competent, blue, the sort of necessary you are grateful for when you have to be.\n\n\u201cClocks,\u201d Grin said smugly through his rag, muffle wobbling the word until it became reasonable. Kettle removed the rag herself and put it back in his mouth so quickly he almost bit her, then blushed when he realised she had been faster than him out of love not malice.\n\nThey watched the Patrol lay down cones and embarrassment as if the two were the same colour and had to be distributed evenly. The ghosts under the Jetty swore with relief, which is the only time anyone should swear near soup. Poppy, from a window where she had been instructed to practise thinking about not walking at night, put her nose to the glass and watched competence pass like a boat. The weather, satisfied for the moment that it had some role to play that did not involve dragging anyone by the ankles out of their beds, stretched like a well-fed animal and promised to be interesting in the afternoon.\n\nThey went to the Old Copse again because oaks sulk when thanked by proxy. The grandmother accepted a second apology as if it had never been owed and then accepted the apology again because forgiveness is a habit that improves with repetition. Nettles lifted their proper flags along the fence and ran shivers up their stems to show off. Needle muttered a vicious pun into the wattle and the feathers that still clung there fell out in a sulk so delicious Rill laughed aloud and the oak did not scold him for it.\n\nBy the time they had all eaten what was left in Kettle\u2019s tin and Rill had catalogued the wishes stuck under the bridge with blue clay in neat ticks like a bookkeeper of the tide, the day had become ordinary in that deceptive way days have when they have been doing hazardous work and would now like to be mistaken for laundry. The rope on Rill\u2019s name had stopped humming and settled into a posture of domestic tyranny. Candle tucked Harold\u2019s flake deeper under the cloth on his nail and whispered something to it that sounded like joinery and prayer. Blot rubbed his fingers together until the ink stopped thinking it was more important than he was and had the grace to become merely stubborn. Green George sat on the edge of a crate and listened to the lead line remember depths with contentment, which is how you properly care for elder tools. Needle took stock of jokes and found she had three left that could be used on shrubs and two she would hold back for councils, which meant her day had been judicious. Grin leaned against a post and did not make an entrance or an exit, which may have been the cleverest thing he did all week.\n\nWhen evening came down like a clean sheet shaken over a bed, they went home in their separate directions because belonging is easier when it has corners. Rill walked the harbour once with his knuckles brushing the old rail so it could count him as a familiar and not an event. He marked the underside of the Twin Sails where his clay had been nicked by a coaxing laugh earlier, and the clay did not sigh because clay does not sigh, but the bridge settled a millimetre, which is better. He put a hand on the Jetty\u2019s beam where the light folds and thanked glass for listening, and it pricked his palm lightly by way of reply, which is the language of things that cannot speak and never lie.\n\nAt his bolt-hole over the drain that used to be a matter of civic contention and was now his back door, he sat with his feet in the water because he liked cold that told the truth. He took yet out of his pocket\u2014not the bottle because that properly lived in Grin\u2019s coat now\u2014but the taste of it, which had become his. He rolled it on his tongue as if he could tell by it whether tomorrow would require more of him than he had and if so whether his hands would do it anyway. The rope on his name warmed once. He smiled because there were mouths in the world, carved and otherwise, that would try to be clever tomorrow, and he had soup, and thread, and a child\u2019s no returned with thanks, and Old Harry\u2019s grudging sympathy, and a channel humming to itself in the bed it knew.\n\nThe laugh under the chalk slept, if that is what coils do when they do not think, and dreamed lacklustre, wholesome dreams. The heaths told themselves stories about not burning, which is a new genre and worth encouraging. The Patrol went home cross and not broken, and one of them wiped soup off a jacket with the corner of a towel and kissed a person who had made it. Poppy went to bed with all her walls in the right places and one window not quite closed because somewhere a gull had an opinion worth hearing at three in the morning. Grin lay on his back staring at a ceiling he did not deserve, with a rag on his chest and a bottle under his pillow, and tried very hard to fall asleep before he made a joke that would wake him up again by coming true. Kettle, needle on her lap, cooked tomorrow in her head, which is how you make days edible before they are born. Candle sat in the dark because it is where he keeps the parts of himself that need quiet, and he talked to chalk until chalk sighed and shut up.\n\nRill, small, salt, nettle, chance, closed his eyes. He did not ask for endings. He did not ask for beginnings. He asked for lines and for the good, plain thread to pull on when laughter, which is not the enemy, forgets that it is a bridge and not a blade. The harbour turned in its sleep and showed him its good side, and he catalogued that as well because you do not only write down bad days. He slept without blue clay under his head for the first time in two nights and dreamed of tying the horizon to a bucket with an anchor bend and being forgiven by nobody because nobody had been angry. The morning came as it always did, with a cough and a grin and the smell of someone else\u2019s toast, and he woke with both hands open, ready.",

                              "content": "Rill woke to the respectable noises of a harbour denying it had done anything dramatic in the night. The drain under his bolt-hole coughed contentedly and spat a fish scale with the air of a man clearing his throat before reading minutes. He lay for a moment with his palms upright, feeling for aches. The burns on his hands had settled to polite reminders, the rope around his name purred against his skin like a cat with opinions about the duvet, and the world, all vastness and errands, leaned amicably against his door. He did not so much stretch as unfurl; people made of knots did not stretch without untying something they might need later. He stood, rubbed sleep from the corners of his eyes with a forefinger he had promised not to lie with, and tasted the morning to see whether it had decided to be a list or a story. It tasted of toast, of wet slate, and of a red thread with manners clearing its throat.\n\nThe thread lifted itself from his wrist with the self-importance of a committee member who has discovered the biscuits and now wants to pass an important motion. It did not tighten, which was courteous. It merely inclined in the manner of a dog pointing, the way threads do when they are sure they can be trusted with a bit of agency and not ruin the carpet. Rill tilted his head and followed the gesture with his attention before he let his feet follow with boots. The Jetty was not calling, not precisely, and neither was the chalk. The tug lay upriver where the sea becomes a conversation with the Frome and the tides decide to be democratic with mud. The other end had found his name like a fish nose knows the difference between water that has been to London and water that has only heard rumours of it.\n\nKettle\u2019s knock on his door was not a knock so much as a competent arrangement of knuckles against wood. He opened at once because there is no point in making a kettle wait. She was already in her day, hair scandalised by the weather, apron pocket a riot of items that looked like kitchen implements and were in fact treaties. She thrust a mug into his hands that smelled like the underside of fog and pepper and considered him with the satisfaction of someone who has counted all the spoons and found none missing. \u201cThe thread?\u201d she asked, though the red had already curled itself against her wrist in greeting and given her a ceremonial tap like an invitation to a dance with footnotes. \u201cI felt it tug while my porridge was pretending not to be cross. Does it want our shoes or our ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wants our river,\u201d Rill said. He sipped her drink and felt it make itself at home in his ribs. \u201cThe inland end is sniffing at us. The Frome has a thought and it is treading water in a way that promises either news or trouble and I don\u2019t like leaving those two alone. The weir at Wareham is in the mood to count itself aloud. We should go before it starts asking the Patrol to help it find the name of a fish that has no truck with whistles.\u201d\n\nNeedle appeared like a remark you had been hoping no one would add and then discovered you had been saving a seat for. She looked like she had not slept, or like she had slept and stabbed the bed for snoring. She had twine around her wrist and pins in her hair and a scowl sharp enough to make a bottle rethink its label. \u201cIf we must go inland,\u201d she said with the offended contempt coastal sprites have for any mention of fields, \u201cI will come and correct everyone\u2019s nouns. Rivers think they are metaphors when they are simply badly organised roads. I will not have the Frome confusing end with bend. Also there is a rumour going about that a ladder for fish has become an escalator and is now charging. I cannot abide escalators.\u201d\n\nGrin arrived last because he had been practising not arriving at all, which is the sort of late that sometimes passes for improvement when you are keeping your expectations on a leash. He carried his wet rag folded over his arm like a churchgoer who intends to mind his hymn book. The bottle with yet slept in the pocket over his heart, which would have been symbolic if he had not known symbols personally and had therefore decided not to give them the satisfaction. \u201cGoing inland,\u201d he observed brightly, which earned him a look from Kettle that sanded the brightness off neatly. He put up his hands. \u201cI will be a tourist with my mouth full of propriety. I will point at cattle and refrain from puns. I will not fall in love with a bridge.\u201d He paused, then sighed because honesty had turned up at the table uninvited and claimed a chair. \u201cI might fall in love with a bridge.\u201d\n\nThey went sideways first because sideways is quicker until it isn\u2019t. The path through the hard edges of town to where the river made manners was stacked with laundry of light. The market men had their crates turned to show off the best oranges as if they had grown them under Poole\u2019s shy sun rather than bought them off a truck at an hour when good people refuse to know numbers. A woman mended nets with the unconscious elegance of someone who does things better when she does not think about being witnessed. The Patrol had set their cones exactly where Kettle had told them and somehow made it look like their idea, which is the sort of magic that keeps towns from collapsing at corners. Poppy, behind a dignified curtain twitch that could have signed its name, gave them a very solemn wave with the hand that had worn the clay and then went back to the important business of pretending to eat breakfast at a speed she would never achieve without bribery.\n\nBefore they left the harbour proper, Rill stopped under the Twin Sails and pressed his palm to the smear of clay he had placed the day before. It answered like a cat pressed against a shin, affronted and appeased in the same breath. He murmured names down into the seam because bridges like to be given their roll-call when they have been sick and survived. Kettle flicked a breadcrumb at a gull who had been thinking philosophical thoughts about chips and redirected it to more practical ambitions. Needle ran iron along the rail where the wrong laugh had scratched itself, sanding sound with sound. Grin watched without comment, his eyebrows writing seventeen jokes he would not say aloud because he was not that idiot this hour.\n\nThe river took them with its particular pulse, which is not sea and not stream but something stubborn in the middle. It moved like an elder who knows the shortcuts in town and resents anyone else taking them. The first reach past Holes Bay had a wide, placid pretence on top and a closed lip of current underneath. Barges lay on their sides in the mud as if practising fainting; a heron in scandalous grey stared at them with the long contempt of a professional. Rill put his hand on the gunwale and felt the Frome judging his grip. He did not squeeze back because rivers do not like to be told they are handshakes.\n\nAt the bend where Wareham shows its shoulders, the river began to talk about the mill with the self-importance of a person dealing with a neighbour. They could hear the wheel that no longer turned remembering itself and trying to drum its old rhythm into water that had learned to be less obedient and more interesting. The weir spoke in its own accent, a thin metal song hummed through the teeth of boards that had been measured by men with pencils and then ignored by water with time. Candle was waiting on the bank with his cap carefully neutral and his mouth set to the hymnal page that says you are allowed to speak and also to listen without quarrelling. He had arrived ahead of them because Candle always arrived ahead of them. He inclined his head and the weir scowled in a way that told you it was flattered.\n\nWareham\u2019s bridge, stone and self-consciously picturesque, held itself the way bridges do when they have been on postcards. It had grown very used to watching weddings go across it and did not intend to be part of an argument. On the far side, where the path kinks like a shame, a man in a high-visibility jacket stood with a clipboard and the face of someone who had been handed a set of measurements and a budget and was trying to reconcile them with a landscape that continually refused to fit its own outlines. He did not see sprites because he was not a child and because his list had not left room for that line. He saw suspicious swans instead and gave them a wide berth, which is a skill you should put on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 while swans still let you.\n\nThe weir\u2019s thought was tangled. It had collected driftwood ideas behind its teeth and the ideas had knotted. A fish ladder sat to the left like a polite afterthought and a piece of modern guilt, and it hummed to itself in bad lift music as tiny lives tried to make it a story about perseverance rather than the more accurate one about rude obstacles. Rill crouched on the stone lip, put a hand to the ladder, and felt in it the scratch of a joke someone had left, the sort of joke that uses stairs as a punchline and thinks itself superior. It made his fingers itch as if he had put them too near sugar. He did not bother to be offended at the wit; he had known sharper people than this and they had also mistaken themselves for edges. He looked to Kettle and she was already there with a tin mug and a scoop, decanting the river into a series of sips so it could taste itself and become less adamant.\n\n\u201cWho told you you were a wall,\u201d Kettle asked the weir briskly, which is how you talk to thresholds that have got above themselves. \u201cYou are a sieve with pretensions, darling. Most sieves I know are content. This behaviour is unbecoming. You are pinching the feet of eels and I will not have it. Drink your water and try again.\u201d\n\nThe weir pretended not to hear her and let out a little screech as a salmon with a grievance flung itself where water had been made square. The fish hit the lip and fell back with a noise like a polite swear. Needle made a face that could curdle milk. \u201cYou are not handsome enough to be cruel,\u201d she told the machinery. \u201cYour angles are not clever and your clatter is undignified. Accept your function before I unpick you one bar at a time and make you into fish forks.\u201d\n\nGrin, forbidden by every sensible rule from taking the front of the conversation, sat on a bollard that was minding its own business and took the rag from his mouth because he needed to breathe and not because he had decided to talk. The bottle under his coat rapped against his rib like a very small teacher. He held himself quiet by sheer novelty. Candle stepped up to the little hut where the lock-keeper\u2019s ghost kept his cap and his cigarettes and touched the old bell that used to be rung when rope needed to be respected. He did it gently and with faith and the bell responded with a dull acknowledgement, like a person getting out of their chair when you call them for tea but not before the news finishes.\n\nFrom the reed bed to the right someone coughed with tiny lungs and then swore in a whisper. Nix stepped into view up to her knees in water with a bucket hooked over her arm, hair wet down the back in a line a less kind person would call untidy and which she called a style. \u201cThe ladder is sulking,\u201d she announced, which was apparent, \u201cand the volunteers have been making speeches at it, which is poison. I told them ladders like compliments and oil, one only of which you have to pay VAT on, and they smiled patronisingly and left. I put oil. It likes me. I need somebody with a better joke than stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cEscalator,\u201d Needle said immediately with the relish of a proper misanthrope. \u201cTell it an escalator is only a lie that has accepted a handrail. Tell it stairs need no moving parts to do their essential work. Tell it we will install a small sign that says Mind The Step and people will obey because they like being told what they already know as if it were news.\u201d\n\nKettle snorted, which is how she applauded. Rill set his palms flat on the ladder\u2019s lip and let the wrong joke slide into his fingers. It was a stale old thing about rising up in the world that had petrified into entitlement. He folded it as if folding a napkin and pressed Poppy\u2019s no, the practical polite version that fits in domestic corners, against it. Jokes, when you make them stop being clever, become heavy. He let this one sink onto the stone beside him where it could be swept later into a bin. He then told the ladder a very small joke about an eel in a lift that could not press the buttons and had to ask politely. The ladder, which had never been asked for anything but compliance, gurgled despite itself. It had a taste for please and thank you when the vowels were used competently. The water on the steps changed its mind about whether it preferred to sulk on the lip or run along the edge and chose the latter. The salmon, suspicious but opportunistic, flicked its tail and went up without telling anyone because secrecy is how some victories are. Three eels looked at one another like conspirators and slithered with the exhausted determination that makes you respect eels even when they run charitably afoul of your socks.\n\nThe weir itself offered the long complaint of an old man watching young men carry bricks wrong. Candle murmured acknowledgements that did not fix any of it and nonetheless made it less painful. Green George, who had arrived with the displeased cheer of a man who knows how much rope it will be his job to carry later, leaned over the rail and knocked gently on a plank that had been mis-nailed as a statement. \u201cWe will persuade you to be decent,\u201d he told the weir, eyes narrowed with patient intent, \u201cand you will pretend not to enjoy it so you can tell your friends we bullied you. We will all know the truth but lie as a favour because pride is a child and needs fruit cut up for it in a bowl sometimes.\u201d\n\nThe lock-keeper\u2019s ghost made his presence explicit at last simply by being sufficiently felt. He was a man of fifty-three infinitely because he had died doing a job that required fifty-three forever. He had a cap that was now a thought about a cap and a pencil behind an ear that had been chipped by wind in 1978. His voice came out the way tea tastes when it has been brewed in a pot that has seen more wars than weddings. \u201cThe Board wrote me a letter,\u201d he muttered without preamble. \u201cThey said the new funding was for safety, and then they took the ladder out for six weeks and left me with a bin bag and courage. I do not mind work. I mind doing the work wrong. That thing down there thinks it knows everything. It does not. Its ideas go sideways into mud and frighten the fry.\u201d\n\nRill tipped his head respectfully and put his hand out, palm up. The ghost put nothing into it because that is not how the living and the dead exchange anything of use, and yet Rill felt a little weight like a key only real if you wanted to open a door that believed in you. He closed his fingers because you do that when a person gives you their name in any form. \u201cWe are not the Board,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the Keepers. Not of yours particularly. Of two ends, which is already more than we ought, and is manageable only because we have Kettle and she has soup. We won\u2019t take your ladder. We\u2019ll put a joke on it you can use when they come with clipboards. It will sound like compliance and taste like stubbornness and be nutritious in an emergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompliance,\u201d Needle said with disgust so crisp you could sprinkle it over chips, \u201cis a word that has learned to be both polite and vengeful. I like it on ladders better than on tongues.\u201d\n\nThe river had opinions and did not pretend not to. It slid its weight against the weir with a deliberate patience that made the structure consider the possibility that it had always intended to be porous. Rill shaped a knot in the air, not on water because that is a nuisance, and cast it very lightly across the top of the weir\u2019s idea. He did not tie the river\u2014no one ties a river without losing a footnote later\u2014but he set the knot out where fish could catch it with their eyebrows if they lacked better plans. Fish have more eyebrows than people think, they simply keep them internal for privacy. He whispered yet into the wood where the water paused, and the pause became a turn, which is what you want in rivers and in arguments with your older aunts.\n\nThe man in high-visibility with the clipboard, whose name was perhaps Simon or possibly Declan depending on the day and who had an older sister who had rescued him from ponds by his ear, looked down and saw the ladder begin to behave and felt it as relief in his shoulders. He did not see any sprites and he would not remember to tell the Board that sometimes water finds its own engineer, but he would go home with soup on his jacket if he was lucky and a story about making progress if he was less so. He turned, made a note he did not fully understand in a box that had asked for numbers and had received adjectives. The ghost of the lock-keeper watched him with the forgiving scorn of a man who had once been young enough to be wrong to the proper scale.\n\nWareham\u2019s bridge listened to itself being admired without congratulating itself. Candle leaned his shoulder against the old stone and shared weather. Kettle, who had run out of reasons to be angry for ten minutes, cleaned the lip of the ladder with a rag that had been mood and was now a tool. Needle collected three more appalling escalator jokes and labelled them with disgust because you must always keep a store of the weapons you refuse to use for the times when shrubs insist. Grin, whose abstinence had begun to make his tongue itch, let a small, harmless play on current die unspoken and felt the bottle under his heart warm as if someone had nodded to him in another room and he had decided to be flattered by the nod and not the room.\n\n\u201cUpstream,\u201d the red thread insisted, nudging Rill\u2019s wrist again, not rude but obstinate. The Frome had let them fix a lip and now wanted them to meet a new tooth. There was a pinch in the water beyond the bridge where a back eddy had stored something sharp and would not admit it was hoarding. It tasted of iron and a promise written on paper you were not supposed to lick. Rill made a face, tasted again, and recognised the signature of an old thing that did not think it was old because it dressed itself in the latest phrasing. The river had acquired a regulation.\n\nGreen George swore under his breath in a nautical that had kept boats afloat for a century. \u201cSomebody has put a net across her in the wrong place,\u201d he said without needing to see it, because men who have cast without hurting fish can smell arrogance in braided cord. \u201cNot a real net. A rule. It\u2019ll have floats. It\u2019ll catch words before it catches water. We had one in \u201886 and we taught it to become rope for a wash line. That was a good day.\u201d\n\nThey went up and found it at a meander section where the Frome allowed herself the luxury of dignity. Two new posts had been driven, bleached within an inch of what wood likes, and between them someone had strung a bright blue line festooned with triangles of plastic that flapped in the keen with the arrogant democracy of festivals. The pennants read Keep Out in a font that assumed you were already ashamed. They had not been placed to keep anyone from drowning. They had been placed to keep the river from being river in that particular place. The water had kinked to accommodate them, which is what water does when it needs to and shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nKettle put her hands on her hips in a way that said good morning to the fight and cracked her neck like a woman preparing to lift insult out of a room. Needle sniffed as if someone had put marmalade in the tea. Candle looked at the posts with tender eyes and addressed them as boys who had fallen in with the wrong crowd. Blot, appearing from the reed with a ledger the damp had not dared to warp, made a note that looked like a drawing of a man with a hat on backwards. Green George tested the line with a thumb and a sigh. Grin made the face he made when he liked a toy he wasn\u2019t allowed. Rill set his palms on the air where two words had glued themselves and felt the glue\u2019s cheapness. He put his ear to a triangle and heard, behind the Keep Out, another phrase the maker had not intended to use. It said End Of.\n\n\u201cEnd of what,\u201d Needle demanded of the triangles with the fury of a librarian dragged into a meme. \u201cEnd of sentence? End of laugh? End of a budget line? End of patience? Do you intend to end a river and if so have you informed the fish or do you plan to leave a voicemail.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnd of a paddle lease,\u201d the ghost of the lock-keeper offered unhelpfully, and then added with relish, \u201cEwan in licensing is in love with triangles. He likes to see them flutter. He thinks it adds tone. He is allergic to mud. He once called a sluice gate a crop. I will haunt him, but first I will make him a cup of tea because I was his father\u2019s friend and he is not irredeemable, merely flammable.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep Out,\u201d Kettle read, and her mouth did something that could have grown into a grin in another kitchen and became instead a plan. \u201cAll right. We will keep out. We will keep out what should be kept out. We will keep out the laugh and the end and the arrogance and we will fling them into a ditch to sulk. The rest can come through as it needs. We will repurpose signage with courtesy.\u201d\n\nRill took hold of the red thread and invited it to tighten, just this once. It did, delighted to be acknowledged, and put its teeth into his pulse with an enthusiasm that made him forgive it. He anchored it with the rope on his name so it would not run away with him and set his hands to the blue line. He did not cut it. He had no wish to fight a municipal resentment and he respected the person who had carried posts to a river and done their job badly while meaning well. He slid the Keep between his fingers and set it to one side. The Out he rewrote by moving three letters in his palm and asking Blot to dab the ink where it would stay without making a boast of it. When he let go the triangles now read Keep Flow, which was a suggestion and not an order and thus possible. The posts did not notice themselves improved; posts do not have that sort of vanity. They stood where they had been pounded with diligence and the river passed them consenting to be itself.\n\nGrin allowed himself a very small sound that was as close to pride as he had earned. He was not proud of the change. He was proud of his not being the change and being present. This is a skill you learn late and then pretend you always had. The river put its shoulder into the bend again and the back eddy that had been hoarding the smell of pennies moved out into the honest middle and lost its attraction for mischief. Eels ghosted past the revised triangles with a sardonic wiggle and resolved to write to their cousins in two tides\u2019 time about think pieces.\n\nBy the time they came back down under Wareham\u2019s postcard life, the weir had decided to be a sieve and was feeling very superior about it in private. The ladder sang a little actual tune instead of its unreasonable hum. A boy in a red jacket not unlike Poppy\u2019s but shaped for a longer spine leaned on the rail and did not see anything except the satisfaction of moving water because he was borderline in love with physics. Rill stored that face because it is the sort of sight you use later when you need to remind yourself that the future has foolishness of the right kinds in it.\n\nThey took their leave by touching things. Candle put two fingers on the bell because it liked to feel dignified. Kettle dipped her rag and wrung it out with an efficiency that made the lock-keeper\u2019s ghost sigh with admiration and envy. Needle slid her iron across a nail that had been bent and made it straight again with such precision she almost smiled. Green George untwisted a kink from the lead line with a frown that was his private religion. Blot capped his bottle with a noise that meant work completed. Grin put the rag back in his mouth briefly for the sheer ritual of it, then took it out again and tucked it away with care because habit can become liturgy when not observed with malice. Rill pressed his left hand, the liar, into the river just past the weir and then his right, the knotter, and felt both accepted because he had not asked them to be other than they were.\n\nAfternoon was waiting at the harbour with a hand on its hip. The Jetty listened to their return with the grace of a friend who has been minding your cat and was not judged for loving it outrageously. Elder Thatch\u2019s beard had collected small weather. Green George\u2019s coil had, miraculously, not collected any emergencies during their absence and was smug. Poppy sat on Thatch\u2019s crate with a book open and her finger very carefully under each word as if she could lasso them into being slower, and her mother looked a little less like a gate across a doorway and a little more like the person who makes the stew and does not require eternal heroism for it.\n\n\u201cYou look like people who have argued with planks and won,\u201d Thatch observed with the courtly contempt of old men who needed to feel useful and had decided feeling clever was a workable substitute. \u201cDid you fetch the river to heel or did it inform you politely that it would be doing as it liked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe showed it a better joke,\u201d Kettle said. \u201cIt agreed to be funny in the direction of usefulness. The weir has been prevented from making stairs a political act. Needle bullied an escalator. Rill told a sign to mind its prepositions. Grin did nothing objectionable in public and then refrained from boasting about it. Candle made friends with metal. Blot abused ink for the common good. Green George measured decency. We will all now eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one believes me when I tell them resolution has the taste of pepper,\u201d Thatch complained to the Jetty at large, but he reached for a bowl like a man with sense. Rill sat, hands a little shocked at being asked to do nothing, and let soup become his afternoon. The rope around his name warmed once, an acknowledgement without orders. The red thread patted his wrist and lay down with its nose on its paws because even threads have the sense to nap in good company.\n\nIt might have been an ordinary ending to a useful day if the glass had not hiccuped. It was not the wrong laugh; it was a ripple, a refractive twitch along the underside of the Jetty, like a fish showing a side of itself you do not see unless it wants you to. Candle turned his head and so did the lock-keeper\u2019s ghost who had walked with them as far as the post and then become again the man who minds the bell and remembers names. The ripple became a picture for an instant, and for that instant the Jetty was not a Jetty but a window someone had not thought to shut in France or Ireland or the other side of a coincidence. Rill saw, he could not help it, a quay that was not their quay, a harbour mouth with shoulders cut more severely, and a set of sails that were not twin but triple, and a woman with a badge that read Port Authority and a face that had been loved badly by a job once and then decided to do it anyway. She looked down at the water and said something to someone Rill could not see, and the glass closed its polite throat and became theirs again.\n\nGreen George rubbed the bridge of his nose with a finger that had once been broken and was now his favourite weather vane. \u201cThe glass has decided to be a letterbox,\u201d he said, not disapproving. \u201cOther harbours have been bitten and now they are writing. The Council of Estuaries will fancy a conference. They\u2019ll arrive with rules in their hats and the wrong shoes.\u201d\n\nThatch fixed his beard as if it were a sail needing a tug. \u201cWhen harbours recommend one another,\u201d he mused, \u201cthe world is either ending or getting bigger. We will need an agenda and biscuits and a list of what words we will not tolerate. I vote against unprecedented, which is a lazy boast in a parade uniform.\u201d\n\nRill felt the rope on his name change key. Not a pull, not a pinch; a chord. The two ends had spoken to each other through his spine and done it without his permission with the affectionate rudeness of old relatives. He felt a brief, untoward joy bloom in his throat because he had been made a conduit and had not broken. He looked at Kettle and she looked back at him with a ladle already poised, which is what passes for comfort in his world. \u201cWe are going to need rooms,\u201d he said, and it felt like the first talk of a wedding and a court case simultaneously. \u201cAnd chairs that do not splinter when a smug person leans on the wrong bit. And invitations to people we do not like who nonetheless are responsible for useful things in places we do not know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a plan for Grin,\u201d Needle added with relish, as if ordering dessert. \u201cHe will want to host and I will want to stab. We will need to compromise. Perhaps he can host the restroom.\u201d\n\nGrin put a hand over his heart as if she had shot him there and then remembered that was where the bottle lived, and he removed it carefully and let his hand hover in apology over his chest. He managed seriousness with an effort that would have made a better man proud and him simply tired. \u201cI will write the programme,\u201d he offered, almost meek. \u201cI will print yet in the margins where no one expects useful things and will encourage breaks for soup. I will stand at the door and make people laugh where they should not and be embarrassed where they must. And when a person stands to make an ending a spectacle I will sit down in front of them and chew my rag.\u201d\n\nKettle looked at him long and then nodded once. She had not forgiven him and would not start a habit of it in public. She had given him a job because idleness is how disasters crouch. Candle rolled his shoulders and let the Jetty\u2019s light take the good side of his face as if to say, very well then, we will allow the day one more thing before we allow bed to happen. Blot snapped his ledger shut with a noise like a promise. Green George went to find more rope because conferences liked to unravel. Thatch sat back on his crate and began composing in his head the opening speech for an assembly of tide, something without adjectives and with three good nouns you could nail planks to.\n\nPoppy looked up from her book because the grown-up weather had changed. She slid off the crate with the practised stealth of a child and came to stand beside Rill. She put her hand on his rope without being told and without asking because some permissions live in the fibres of certain afternoons. It warmed under her palm, and Rill for one beat of his heart did not think of ends or cracks or weirs or chalk. He thought of chairs. He thought of biscuits. He thought of a harbour that had decided to remember itself aloud across languages and distances and the tender arrogance of tides. He let himself imagine he would be the person in the room who would say yet when endings stood up and introduced themselves with their hobbies and their CVs. He let himself imagine that would sometimes be enough.\n\nEvening sloped in not so much later as kindly. They made lists on the Jetty: who would come because they were asked, who would come because they were not and could not help themselves, who would need to be lured with respect and who with an opportunity to have their hair admired. Letters would be written to the Solent and the Exe, to the Mersey if she would lower herself to correspond with the south, to harbours not made of stone at all but of mangrove and memory because they were thinking of inviting the whole world and needed to be stopped. Candle drafted words for stone to read. Blot drafted words for people. Needle drafted rules for jokes. Green George drafted a list of knots you should never attempt to tie in public unless you wanted lawsuits. Kettle drafted a menu that involved soups from seven counties and bread that would not disgrace any of them.\n\nThey worked until lamps had to be lit and then worked so that lamps did not have to be lit after that because the glass does not like open flame when it is being a window to other people\u2019s foolishness. Rill took a breath that counted as selfish and set it in his pocket for later. He would go, after this, to the grandmother oak for seven minutes with a cake he had no right to because it had been baked for someone else and gently stolen by a person with moral mathematics. He would tell the oak that the world was coming in pieces to their Jetty and not to worry, the chairs would be set properly and no one would put their hands on her bark without being taught how to by Kettle. He would touch the weir again in a day and tell it the fish had been seen to pass without filing a complaint. He would stand on the cliff and ask Harold if he wanted a new joke to roll under his tongue when the wind was wrong.\n\nWhen he finally let his feet turn toward the drain that was his front garden and his back door, he felt the rope thrum a second time at his name with an almost shy little pride. The Two Ends had met behind his back and decided to throw a party on his Jetty. He had the urge to laugh and did not because he had lately learned restraint around such urges and because laughter carried is sometimes better than laughter spilled. He saved it for the morning when there would be biscuits and pamphlets and at least one serious person mispronouncing Old Harry, and he would need to be a bridge no one noticed crossing until they were on the other side. He saved it because you do not spend all your joy on planning. Some of it must be left for the part where someone stands up with an ending like a hat and you hook it, kindly, by the brim, and hang it on a peg where it can be admired without being worn.",
