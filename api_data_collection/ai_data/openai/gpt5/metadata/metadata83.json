     "novel_text": "The first time the blood spread across the glass like a long slow hand, Evan thought of paint. A smear of barn red, opaque, a child's bold brush dragged across the windshield of the Embraer that was taking sixteen people and their pretzels down toward Cleveland. He had time to think ridiculous things when the strobe picked out the feather-spit in the spray, when the lower leading edge of the wing shuddered from the bird they hadn't seen and couldn't have avoided. The hollow thud ran up his hands where they sat on the yoke. Besides, it wasn't his first strike, and he was supposed to be built for noise and weirdness and the sharp physics of sudden things.\n\n\"Bird,\" said Magda in the right seat, her voice fraudulent-calm, the kind they get as a faculty donation in year one of flight school.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said, and then the hand on the glass became a slick, became drops, and he felt his heart run ahead of the plane, bolting.\n\nHe had flown with a little dread before. Everyone did. There was always the pinprick you hid, a thread hung from each flight that you refused to tug because the sweater of your head would unravel. His had been storms, always storms, anvils and green light, lightning that looked like a mouth opening. But this. This wasn't a storm. It wasn't even dangerous, not exactly. The alerts stayed quiet. The engine numbers were steady, though the left one took a breath he could feel through the floor. Not dangerous. Just red. Red and water and the idea of meat.\n\n\"Checklists,\" Magda said.\n\nHe blinked. It was there in his throat, the sweetness of it, the way you know a nosebleed is about to start, a metal penny somewhere in the back of your tongue. He nodded, but didn't reach for the laminated card. The card was right where it always was, in the slot, red triangles and cool font. His hand refused to go.\n\n\"Ev?\" Magda said, softer.\n\n\"I've got it,\" he said, and the \"it\" felt like a lie. The drops began to crawl upward, slower now because their forward momentum had decreased. He watched one in the perimeter of his vision move in a long lazy comma.\n\nHe knew enough to know his own body. The tremor in his forearms. The way air got stuck behind his sternum like he'd swallowed a cough that was too big. Stupid. You could fly through ice. You could arc around storms in the purple black night with lightning ahead making sculptures out of clouds, silhouettes of Greek gods and teeth. You could make decisions at two hundred knots. So, fine, move your hand. He stared at the card until the ink turned into tiny printed islands. Move your hand, Evan.\n\nMagda's hand landed on his wrist like a perching bird, light, a warning that could be read any way you wanted. \"Breathe,\" she said, and the pity in it made something shameful twinge in his belly. \"Breathe, and start the list.\"\n\nHe inhaled. The cabin was pressurized and dry and smelled faintly of coffee and hydraulic dust. The blood, which he could not exactly smell, had nevertheless colonized his head with its idea. Fine. Breathe in, breathe out. He told his hand to leave his lap. The hand didn't. The hand had declared sovereignty, a republic of skin.\n\n\"Checklist: bird strike, suspected,\" Magda said, and took the card herself. Her voice had become hands, making the words into useful items. He answered where he needed to, because you didn't forget the catechism. Halfway through, the droplets had formed a rake of red across the glass. He could see the runway through it, horizontal lights, the clean line of it, the wetness of the day out there. He focused on that, on the over-run lights like things you could walk on. He would centerline this thing, he would taxi it, he would sign paperwork and then he would go to the closet in the crashpad and he would sleep with his head under the coat that smelled like rain.\n\nThey landed. Everyone applauded, because everyone always did on these little runs, and he tried to feel the old soft irony of that, or the old soft fondness. He felt nothing except for an almost empty relief, like the feeling right after you've almost fallen down the stairs. Magda's hand was again a bird. \"You're white,\" she said. \"Like... extra white.\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" he said, and he couldn't tell if it was true.\n\nThe captain of maintenance met them at the gate with a bucket and that fake brightness that ground guys sometimes have when they know the pilots think they're the help. \"Gonna need you to fill out\u2014\"\n\n\"I know,\" Evan said, but it came out a whisper.\n\n\"You okay, Marlowe?\" the man said, and he meant it, but he also meant Am I going to have to call anyone.\n\n\"Fine,\" Evan said. He didn't look at the windshield. He didn't look at the rag in the man's hands with the rust on it. He didn't look at the smear. When they got the debrief in the small room with the bad chair and the black coffee, he held the styrofoam cup like a charm. He thought, idiot, birds hit planes. This isn't a story. This is Tuesday.\n\nHe went back out into the chill slick of the jetway when all was said and done and the passengers had gone and the jet was quiet, and he put his hand on the fuselage. It felt like tapping a sleeping animal. He loved it. He felt something like love anyway, a memory of it. He had the absurd thought that his love should be stronger than a smear on a windshield, that love of a thing should toughen you, like callus or scar.\n\n\"Hey,\" Magda said again, as if perhaps he had gone somewhere. \"Hey. You're shaking.\"\n\n\"It's cold,\" he lied, and walked as if he were not walking.\n\nLater, in the crew room, he took a breath and caught sight of a news clip on the television overhead: a house burned in Chicago, the camera loving the curl of black and orange, and then an old man with a bandage crooked on his head, red moisture leeching through the gauze. For a second he thought he would vomit.\n\nHe put an arm against the wall. He didn't, because he'd learned long ago how not to do things. He went to the locker and took his bag and he went to the bus to the parking lot, and he drove to his crashpad through Columbus twilight, and the trees were black cut-outs and everything felt like it had been recorded, like he was playing back a thing that had already happened.\n\nAt the crashpad, Max from dispatch sat on his couch with a beer and a video game. He grunted. \"You look like someone shot you with flour.\"\n\n\"Bird,\" Evan said.\n\nMax laughed. \"Hate those stupid feather missiles. You good?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Evan said. He showered with the water too hot, as if he could scald the day away, and thought, this is very dramatic, isn't it, Marlowe. He brushed his teeth and saw toothpaste like foam like something else and swore and turned away. He slept for three hours and woke with his heart scudding in his chest, like a horse in a small barn.\n\nTwo days later, on the tarmac in Detroit, he watched a ramp guy trip, land on his palms, and nick his chin. The cut was mean, a tiny quiver in the man's face and then a line, a line that in the cold wind beaded. Evan felt the world go at an angle. A ramp guy. A nick. He went down on his heels by the tug, his breath loud in his ears like he was listening to a shell.\n\nYou can't fly like this, he thought, as if someone else had said it to him. You can't.\n\nHis chief pilot, a man named Fischer with a neat beard and the chill composure of someone who likes maps, called him into the office after the Thursday commuter flights had been farmed out to other souls with other bags under their eyes. The office had a picture of a Cessna framed like a diploma.\n\n\"You want me to guess?\" Fischer said.\n\n\"It's... I don't know,\" Evan said. \"I'm off. I think I'm catching some kind of\u2014\"\n\n\"Not sick,\" Fischer said, like he'd already set the suspects in a line and shot them. \"You're white as a paper cup. And Burke told me you had to sit down in Detroit because you saw a little blood.\"\n\nIt's amazing, how quickly it spreads, he thought. Words. Like weather off a lake.\n\n\"It's not like I'm going to faint,\" he said, though once, twelve years old in a school gym when a girl fell off the pyramid in cheerleading and hit her eyebrow on the floor, the red made the world go velvet and he put his head between his knees like the gym teacher said, and the floor smelled like sneakers and wood polish and something sweet.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" Fischer said, folding his hands so you knew he thought it was important. \"I know men who can't fly in November because the sunlight at four o'clock makes them cry. I know a lady who has to count to two hundred before she pushes up the thrust levers. We used to take people like that out back behind the hangar and tell them to get their heads right. I am not that guy and this isn't that airline. If you're telling me you got a problem with blood, you get to go talk to somebody, and you don't get to fly until somebody says you're good.\"\n\n\"I didn't sign up for sick leave.\"\n\n\"Then take unpaid,\" Fischer said, not unkindly. \"You want to kill sixteen strangers because a passenger has a nosebleed in Row 9?\"\n\nEvan thought of the bird becoming smear becoming hand. He thought of the idea of blood behind the sight of blood, the entire architecture of what it meant. He had always thought he didn't fear mortal things, that his fear was shapeless, fog-like. Now, suddenly: a shape.\n\n\"I'll go home,\" he said.\n\n\"You got family?\"\n\n\"In Westerville,\" he said. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Fischer said. \"Go let them make casseroles. When you come back, we'll still be here.\"\n\nHe didn't feel very casserole. He put his bag in the trunk of the old Mazda he kept in the employee lot because it was paid off and because he had never liked anything that looked expensive. He drove north on 71 until it softened into the Columbus belt, then off into the map he could draw with his eyes closed: the older trees, the weirdly wide streets, the old brick that someone had deliberately left old, the town that had reinvented itself from old new, from Methodist to microbrew without quite forgetting either.\n\nWesterville had a particular quiet to it in summer, like bees in your head. He could hear it as he turned onto State, the storefronts with letters that were trying too hard, the woman he recognized even if he didn't know her name walking a dog with a sweater like a golf club. He stopped in front of his mother's house even though he had not called. The porch boards sang hello under his feet as they had sung when he was nine and twelve and nineteen and left without telling anyone for Indianapolis because he had gotten a job washing airplanes and you didn't announce that you were going to become someone else.\n\nJune opened the door even before he knocked. She had a sixth sense for her child, or that was what she said, and also she never took off that necklace with the shell button and the tiny sliver of sea glass, and it made a small sound against the door, a clink like a teaspoon. She wore a sleeveless blouse that showed the freckle on her shoulder he had memorized as a toddler. Her eyes flicked from his face to his bag to his face again in a flash so quick you could almost miss the calculation.\n\n\"Are you in trouble?\" she said, but with love; in their family \"trouble\" could be anything from a breakup to death.\n\n\"Only the usual,\" he said, and tried to make his mouth look like a joke. She hugged him anyway, the way she hugged, fully, like she was taller than she was, like he could disappear if she didn't do it whole. He felt briefly like a little boy back under the canopy of her life.\n\n\"You smell like airport,\" she said into his collar. \"Come in, make that go away.\"\n\nThe house was saturated with her. Plants that were always about to die but never did. A rug his grandmother had braided, the edges slightly upturned like it was smiling. In the kitchen, Arthur sat at the table with a newspaper and his careful glasses. Arthur wore glasses like a man who had practiced them. Everything about him was careful, though he worked with wood and sometimes got splinters. He raised a hand. He wasn't mean. He wasn't kind either. He was a good stepfather at a distance, which was better than a bad one up close.\n\n\"You hear?\" Arthur said, and did not explain what \"you\" or \"hear\" were supposed to mean. He had that voice of men who assume you live in the same head.\n\n\"I heard birds,\" Evan said, and Arthur snorted in a way that could have been either affectionate or not.\n\n\"Your mother marked the calendar when it's squirrels at the feeder. If I had to mark birds on glass I'd run out of ink.\"\n\n\"Arthur,\" June said. \"Be gentle.\"\n\n\"I'm not being not gentle. I'm being factual,\" he said, which was how you knew he wasn't just being factual.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Evan said. \"I'm taking some leave.\"\n\nShe gave him that look, a twin of Magda's, the same species of human creature who had told you to breathe when you forgot. \"And you came home.\"\n\n\"I've got other places, but none of them have a porch,\" he said. \"Besides, the rent's paid to the landlord of Mom. You can't beat the rate.\"\n\n\"You can always beat the rate if you tell me with enough notice to put a roast in,\" she said, but she brought him a beer that wasn't craft and didn't care. \"Do you want me to call Colm? He was here yesterday for lunch like a thunderstorm.\"\n\nThere it was, the other ghost in the house. The stepbrother whose name could change the temperature in a room. Not because of any fault; because of presence. Colm had a presence like a mantelpiece you didn't choose but someone had bolted above your fireplace. It was stately, beautiful, annoying. He had come with Arthur ten years before and had adapted to the house like ivy, soft and covering and unstoppable.\n\n\"It is a weekday,\" Evan said. \"Doesn't he... do something at night?\"\n\n\"Who can tell,\" Arthur said into his coffee. \"He calls it work. He comes home with money and stories that can't be true. There's a smell like a candle when he's done, and your mother puts out bread on the counter because she thinks he hasn't eaten.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" June said.\n\n\"You do,\" Arthur said, \"but I don't hold it against you. That's what mothers do with creatures who look hungry. They feed them until they stop howling.\"\n\n\"Don't scare him,\" she said. She turned back to Evan. \"Do you want me to call?\"\n\nHe hesitated, and the hesitation had layers. Colm and he had never been one thing. They had been a series of small treaties built and broken and built again. Colm was older by three years but younger in ways that made him dangerous to himself and others. He had a laugh like a match being struck. He had a way of standing in a doorway so that you knew you were in the room and not in the world. He also knew everybody in Westerville who thought they were somebody and most of the people who were truly somebody and didn't look it. If there was a party, he could get in the back door of it. If there was a problem, he could find the ditch it had gotten stuck in and pull.\n\n\"Sure,\" Evan said. \"I could use a\u2014\" What? A wing no, don't say that. A break. A job? \"A distraction.\"\n\nJune nodded and went to the wall where the phone numbers were still written on paper because she didn't trust the small glass rectangle where everything else lived. Evan went to the back door and watched rain starting to form on the maple leaves. The sky had low clouds like a ceiling that needed repainting. He felt weirdly relieved to be in a place where skies were just skies.\n\nHe told himself he had always known how to sit with things, but the truth was he had always moved. He had been a mover since he was old enough to imagine motion. As a child he ran in circles around the coffee table until his mother made him stop not because of furniture but because the circle inside his legs scared her. The first time he saw a cockpit, he had the feeling some people have when they step into a church that is older than their language. He belonged. He'd learned to belong in that small room with a thousand levers, and to pretend the rest of his life was an annex to that room.\n\n\"He's coming,\" June said, too fast, like if she said it slow she would be admitting something. \"He says he was coming anyway.\"\n\n\"He always says that,\" Arthur said.\n\n\"So do you,\" she told him, and he shrugged.\n\nColm arrived like he had a key to the house he didn't; the door opened and he walked in on June's \"come in!\" like a rumor that had decided to become a man. He had that thing where he looked different each time. Today he looked like he'd been to a place where money went to get old, a thrift store where the good suits ended up. His jacket was soft and small at the shoulder, a little too tight, and his shoes were not quite brown or black. He smelled faintly like something hot. It wasn't cologne, exactly. It was like someone had put cinnamon through and then opened a window.\n\n\"Brother,\" he said, and it was the word itself that got you, the way he said it with gratitude as if the world owed him nothing and then gave him this boy to be brother to and he was going to say thank you for the rest of his life. \"You look like you got introduced to winter and told to shake hands.\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" Evan said, default setting.\n\n\"You're not,\" Colm said, delighting. He hugged him and Evan stiffened because he always did. It wasn't dislike. It was the way Colm really hugged, with everything, squeezing the air out of your bones like he was checking for coins. Colm stepped back and tilted his head at the way birds do when they see something shiny. \"You get beat up by a bird?\" he said.\n\n\"Sort of,\" Evan said.\n\n\"He got beat up by the idea of a bird,\" Arthur muttered, because Arthur couldn't stop saying what he thought, truly couldn't, it distressed him not to.\n\n\"So you want an idea of a drink or the real thing?\" Colm said. His eyes, which at rest were brown, caught a light that made them look molten sometimes, like they held a little fire. \"There's a place, and there's a person at the place, and the person thinks I am a person who knows other people.\"\n\n\"My big dream,\" Evan said. \"To be a person who knows a person.\"\n\n\"You joke,\" Colm said. He always took jokes personally because to him everything was a gift you could unwrap, and if you didn't unwrap it he couldn't tell whether you liked him. \"But it's a thing. The person is at the Evergreen. They do shows. They are not, you know, Broadway with the chorus lines. But they are... something. And they have a thing that needs a voice and a hand and maybe somebody who can read a map.\"\n\n\"Theater,\" Arthur said, as if the word were a lost relative.\n\n\"Theater,\" Colm said. He rolled the word in his mouth. \"I told them I knew a man who can talk a pilot into landing in a hurricane, and who can make a room like a cockpit, calm. Fine, not a hurricane. A storm that no one else will fly. I said you had a voice like a switch warming up.\"\n\n\"You're selling me like a table saw,\" Evan said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Colm said, unabashed. \"But it's for good.\"\n\n\"What's the job?\" June asked, as if she were not going to approve either way.\n\n\"There is a show,\" Colm said. \"They call it a devised piece. That's arts talk for we are going to do a thing that isn't a musical and it isn't a play and it isn't the news. They want someone to narrate it and someone to do the\u2014\" He made a gesture with his hand that could have been puppets or lights or pressing an elevator button. \"\u2014the cues, the buttons. The person who does that had a baby and then found out she liked having a baby more than having a job. Imagine.\"\n\n\"They want a stage manager,\" June translated.\n\n\"Is that a thing?\" Colm said. \"Then yes.\"\n\n\"I can barely manage myself,\" Evan said.\n\n\"Which is why you're perfect. You need to be better at it. They will boss you. They will be short of funds. They will give you drink tickets and pretend it is money. You will look at girls who pretend they don't look at anyone, and they will look back. And you will not be in the sky, which, from what I've heard, is your current prescription.\"\n\n\"He's not not in the sky because he doesn't want it,\" Arthur said. \"He's on leave.\"\n\n\"I'm not a patient,\" Evan said, though it occurred to him that people who said that usually were.\n\nColm leaned against the doorframe, a habit of his that looked casual and felt like strategy, because now he was between you and leaving. \"It's not for always,\" he said, softer, the sell now a whisper. \"It's for a while. And you'll be around. And I can lend you my bicycle\u2014\"\n\n\"I have a car.\"\n\n\"I don't know that about you,\" Colm said, and he didn't smile; his face was sincere in a way that made you want to either confess something or pretend to be braver. \"I know you fly. And I know\u2014\" he paused, not for drama (though he loved drama) but for honesty\u2014 \"that sometimes, when I walk past the wall where she puts the pictures, your picture looks like you want to run. This isn't running. This is standing in a room and making sure it becomes something. Try it.\"\n\n\"Don't push him,\" June said, which, coming from her to Colm, sounded like a prayer you say because your heart is full and you don't like what comes out when it's overfull.\n\n\"I'm not pushing,\" Colm said. \"I'm pointing. I'm a great pointer. Everyone says so.\"\n\n\"You've met two people today,\" Arthur said. \"The barista and my wife.\"\n\n\"And the third person is the person I know who needs a person,\" Colm said, still smiling. He moved away from the doorframe, gave back the way out. \"You can say no. You can tell me to walk out and I'll walk out. And then I'll walk one more block and lean into the alley and call Tess and say I tried. And she'll say, what do you want me to do, I need someone for tonight's tech run, it's not like someone is going to fall out of the sky.\"\n\nAt that, something in Evan made a bitter noise, a laugh that wasn't a laugh. \"I know,\" he said. His mouth did what it always did: it decided before he did. \"I'll go.\"\n\n\"You'll go,\" Colm repeated, as if that had been his prayer. \"Good. Tonight?\"\n\nJune made a face, which women have made since there were sons. \"He just got in.\"\n\n\"I'll sleep later,\" Evan said. \"If I sleep now I'll dream I'm in the plane and the glass is\u2014\" He stopped, because he had never said it out loud, and because saying it made it less and more at the same time.\n\nThey went out into evening. It wasn't quite rain; it was the weather where drops are arranged so far apart that each one feels lonely. Colm drove because of course he did, because he always took wheels like they were a throne. The car hummed like it had eaten too much honey. The radio played a station that played old songs by women who sounded like they had unscrewed their throats and let the gods sing through. The town slid past\u2014the ice cream place with the kid in a sweatshirt though it was June, the library with its windows lit, the fountain that had always reminded Evan of an upside-down chandelier.\n\n\"You okay?\" Colm said, as if he'd waited the appropriate number of minutes to ask, the number printed in an invisible manual he kept in his chest.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Evan lied, and then didn't. \"No. It's stupid.\"\n\n\"It never is.\"\n\n\"I'm a pilot,\" Evan said, and heard how untrue that sounded. \"I don't get to do this. I don't get to\u2014\" He gestured with a hand that made the turn signal click. \"\u2014be undone by a thing that wouldn't scare a student nurse. The world is full of blood. It's in us right now. I'm fine with it in me. I'm not fine with it on the outside of glass. I've been fine. Now I'm not.\"\n\nColm was quiet, which was rare enough that Evan looked at him. His face had gone profile, an old coin. He looked older when he was quiet. \"When I was ten,\" Colm said, \"my father cut his hand on a lathe. Not your father. Mine.\"\n\n\"I know which one you mean,\" Evan said.\n\n\"You didn't then,\" Colm said, not gently but not cruel, either. \"He was alone in the shop because that was the curse he chose, to always be alone with the things he loved more than us. He called me in because he couldn't find the towel we used for oil. I saw the inside of his hand. There are so many pieces, and they were all living. I fainted. And when I woke up he slapped me. Not because he was cruel. Because he was angry I had done something he did not expect. He said, don't ever drop out like that. Don't ever. And I've been trying to never ever since.\"\n\n\"How's it working out?\"\n\nColm smiled. \"Depends who you ask.\"\n\nThe Evergreen Theatre looked like somewhere you took first dates because it would make you look smarter than you were. The door was painted green in case you didn't get the metaphor, and there was a flyer for a show with hands on it, so many hands, all the hands making a circle. The lobby smelled like coffee and carpet and ambition. A woman in her forties with the saving grace of a crooked nose came down the stairs with her arms full of papers. Her hair was short and gray like she had dared herself to go gray and had won. She carried herself like a person who could say \"no\" and make you grateful.\n\n\"This is him,\" Colm said, like he'd brought her a cat and was hoping she didn't have allergies. \"Evan. The one I told you about.\"\n\n\"Tess,\" she said, untucking a hand. \"Bless you, because I am not above blessing. We're bleeding man-hours.\"\n\nEvan's stomach twanged at the word bleeding, a string plucked. He made his face into a guy face, a here to help face. \"Happy to help.\"\n\n\"You any good with light boards?\" she said, not waiting for the niceties because niceties had been chased out by need.\n\n\"What's a light board,\" he said, honest.\n\n\"Good,\" she said, not missing. \"You'll do what I tell you. Tonight is spacing and cues. Tomorrow is paper tech. Friday we let them think it's a show. There's a script somewhere but we're pretending we don't need it. Got it?\"\n\n\"Got it,\" he said.\n\n\"And you,\" she said to Colm, \"can go home, because I'm not paying for extra eyes.\"\n\n\"You never do,\" he said, and then leaned to kiss her cheek, a gesture so old and gentle it made Evan think they'd known each other longer than the theater had been a theater. \"Don't burn him,\" he said.\n\n\"Me? Burn?\" she said with a snort. \"The place burns. I just put signs on the exits.\"\n\nColm was already halfway to the door. He looked back once, a habit as old as trains, and his look said what he always said when he was leaving you anywhere: you can do this. It was theatrical and real.\n\nEvan followed Tess into the black box that was actually only partly black and more of a charcoal that held light like water. The stage was a flat plane with tape lines in colors that looked like confetti to him. The seats were steep, telling him that whoever sat here had to agree to be sat upon. On the back wall, a faded painted tree suggested that once, not long ago, they'd pretended to be in a park.\n\n\"You're late,\" said a girl whose job it had been, apparently, to tell someone this no matter the hour.\n\n\"He is not late, he's new,\" Tess said. \"There's a difference, and the difference is that 'late' suggests fault and 'new' suggests hope.\"\n\n\"I like her,\" the girl said, and did not even look at him. \"Hi. I'm Vee.\"\n\nShe looked like a person whose face had been designed by someone with a fondness for lines. She had lines around her mouth from smiling and lines on her forehead from other things, and a haircut like she didn't want to be asked about it. Her eyes were clever, which you couldn't say about everyone because not everyone had eyes that had been taught at school. \"Do you know where the subwoofer is?\" she said to him.\n\n\"In my car,\" he said, and that at least made her face change.\n\n\"Okay, he's funny,\" Vee said to Tess. \"We keep him.\"\n\n\"He's here because we lost Sheila,\" Tess said to the cluster of actors in sweats and scarves. \"Not lost lost, just baby lost. This is Evan. He is going to shut things up and turn things on and tell you when to do things.\"\n\n\"You could just call that God,\" said a tall man who had shaved his head and then put a hat on it.\n\n\"You can call it whatever makes you feel special,\" Tess said. \"Places for spacing. Evan: booth.\"\n\nHe learned on the job because there was no other way. The light board was a land of buttons that were numbered and then numbered again in case you were blind. Tess told him that faders were friends. He put his fingers on them and something soothed in him because a small part of him had loved buttons his whole life. He had always loved the command that was not command, the way a lever makes a wall of light appear and you can pretend you did that, like a god with good software.\n\n\"Blackout,\" Tess said.\n\n\"Blackout,\" he said, and drew the fader down until the world became night. His stomach unspooled. There was something here he could love possibly, something like the way sky happens in pieces.\n\nThey ran the tech, which meant they did not act exactly, but moved the things you would later assume had been always in the right place. He watched, he obeyed, he pressed \"Go\" on the board when Tess said \"Go,\" and it felt like flying in that he was not the thing but he was adjacent to the thing. He watched Vee and the tall man with the hat and a girl with a voice like a spoon tap and a man who moved like he hadn't decided if he was a dancer or a tree. They called the piece \"Rend,\" which made Evan remember the smear on the windshield and he told himself he did not have to be triggered by nouns.\n\nAt break, he went down to the stage to coil a cable like they taught you, which is to say you did it right or it would kink and kick like a snake. Vee watched him. \"You did that like you've done it before.\"\n\n\"I coil things in my sleep,\" he said.\n\nShe tilted her head. \"What were you before you were a stage manager for an hour?\"\n\n\"Pilot,\" he said, and waited for the inevitable \"cool.\"\n\nShe said \"Oh,\" but not like that. \"So why are you... here.\"\n\n\"Leave,\" he said; it was the word that had become his answer.\n\n\"Did you break something?\"\n\n\"My brain,\" he said, somewhat obscenely proud. \"It's on recall.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she said, and he blinked. \"Better now than after. Are you going back?\"\n\n\"Dunno,\" he said, and meant the lack of knowing like it was a faith he was trying on, like a ridiculous hat.\n\nShe nodded like someone who had decided not to care too much for a week or a year. \"You should drink water,\" she said, practical. \"There's a jug in the green room. It tastes like cucumbers because Sophie thinks that's hydration.\"\n\nHe drank cucumber water. He watched actors take tiny bites of apples like they were feeding birds out of their own hands. He watched Tess not look at a list and then know everything. He pressed the \"Go\" button when told. The night began to feel like a machine with a rhythm. He watched his body not flinch when someone said \"blood\" in a line about families. He watched himself not be smaller than he had been in the office with Fischer. He watched himself imagine a future that wasn't a cliff.\n\nAt the end of the night, Tess did the thing she probably did every night of her life: she stood on the stage, pretended not to be sentimental, and said, \"Good work, tomorrow eight,\" and then she turned to Evan. \"We pay with checks because the computer hates me. They will bounce if I sign them. So you're paid on Wednesdays and we give you drink tickets for the bar because it's easier.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, and meant, thank you for making a way for me to be in a room.\n\nVee came up to him at the door and said, \"You're better when you don't think,\" and he almost said, \"my whole life will be that sentence,\" but he didn't, because he thought she would get it so hard it would hurt.\n\nOutside, the town had decided to be night. The street was an illustration drawn by a child who had learned perspective yesterday. Colm leaned against the green door, his hands in his pockets because he thought pockets were a personality. He looked wrong for the street and also like the street had shifted to suit him.\n\n\"You waited,\" Evan said, surprised in exactly the way you shouldn't be if you knew Colm.\n\n\"Of course,\" Colm said. \"He was good?\"\n\n\"He pressed buttons with reverence,\" Tess said from behind him, putting key in lock. \"Which is more than I get from my own spine most days. Thank you for the delivery. Pick him up tomorrow? Or does the boy drive himself?\"\n\n\"I can walk,\" Evan said, though he would not, not because he was lazy, but because he had learned to be driven.\n\n\"I will pick him up and feed him something the color of wood,\" Colm said.\n\n\"I don't need to be fed,\" Evan said.\n\n\"You always do,\" Colm said, and there was that other thing in his voice, the thing that came in when it wanted to: authority. Not the authority of a man who knows, but of a thing older than a man. It passed like a cloud. Evan told himself he had imagined it. He told himself that ten times.\n\nBack at the house, June had left a light on like a lighthouse and a note on the fridge that said in her saintly half-cursive: Turkey soup, no actual turkey. He warmed it in a pot because she did not trust microwaves and had told them since they were kids that buttons in the kitchen would make them sterile. He ate it and tasted salt and something under it like thyme. He thought, I am okay in this hour.\n\nHe slept in his old room with the window that had always known a small draft. He dreamed\u2014not of glass and birds, which would have been too obvious\u2014but of a theater with no walls and a voice like his mother's saying \"places\" and Colm's laughter like the sound a match makes. He woke once with his throat locked, the way it locked when he saw red. He went to the kitchen. The light under the microwave clock was green like a feeling you could make disappear with your fist.\n\nWhen he turned around, he saw himself reflected in the window over the sink: his own face, older than it should be at thirty-three; the street light doing a halo it had no right to. And behind him, in the next room where the house held its darkness like a hand holds an egg, a suggestion of someone standing, tall, patient.\n\nHe turned yes, because he was not a coward even if he was.\n\nThe room was empty. Of course it was. It was a house at midnight in a town that liked to pretend there were more things in it than there were. He drank water. He went back to bed and slept like he was falling through a cloud and finding ground and falling again.\n\nMorning came like a song he had half-remembered, the way morning comes when you are in a house that knows you and will forgive your noises. June put coffee in him like a legal drug. Arthur argued with the paper because the paper had opinions. Colm arrived with a bag from a bakery that made cinnamon rolls the size of helmets. He flung the bag on the table like a man throwing gauntlets. \"Eat, or the gods will be angry,\" he said.\n\n\"What gods,\" Arthur said.\n\n\"Mine,\" Colm said. He smiled at Evan over the pastry. \"Ready for day two?\"\n\n\"I'm ready to keep my hand moving when someone says 'go,'\" Evan said.\n\n\"Look at you, a joiner,\" Colm said with delight. \"I never thought I'd see the day.\"\n\n\"You never saw any of the days,\" June said in that way that was light except for the half of it that wasn't.\n\nThey went again to the Evergreen, and again he pressed buttons and coiled cables and tried not to think of himself as a man who had flown but couldn't stand the sight of a finger nick. He watched Vee make herself into someone else and then into herself again. He watched Tess take a call in the corner and say, \"Yes, but no,\" and then say, \"Fine,\" and then say, \"We'll make it work,\" three times. He learned more than he had thought he would. He stood behind the light board in the utter dark and felt powerful and small.\n\nAt break, he stepped outside into an alley that smelled like summer and trash that had not yet decided what it wanted to be. He leaned against the brick. He looked up and let himself look at the slice of sky he could get. It was ordinary day-blue. It did not make his heart run. A pigeon flopped off a ledge and then thought better of it and settled. He laughed out loud, not because it was funny but because it was ordinary.\n\nHe didn't hear Colm come up; he never did. Colm had a way of showing up like a thought you had decided to have. He held out a hand with a paper cup. \"Water with slices of lemon because cucumbers are an abomination,\" he said.\n\n\"How did you\u2014\"\n\n\"I'm everywhere,\" Colm said. He leaned next to Evan and let their shoulders be parallel. He had always known how to stand in exactly the right place to make you feel like you had a brother even if you didn't think you needed one. \"You look less like a deer in a stadium.\"\n\n\"I'm a vole in a library,\" Evan said. He took the cup. The lemon made the water taste like old books.\n\n\"You'll go back to the sky,\" Colm said without punctuation.\n\n\"I will,\" Evan said, because he didn't know if that was comfort or threat and he didn't have the energy to make it either.\n\n\"Do you know why the blimp that lives over by the highway moves so slowly, and why it still scares me even though it's ridiculous?\" Colm said.\n\n\"No,\" Evan said, because if you told him magic he would listen.\n\n\"It is too big and too quiet. Things that are that big should not be quiet. I know that like I know I shouldn't look straight at the moon when it's full because it will break my neck. You'll go back when you can.\" He took a breath like he was taking in more than air. \"I brought you here for a reason.\"\n\n\"I assumed you brought me here because Tess needed hands and you owe her fourteen things.\"\n\n\"Seventeen, but who's counting.\" Colm shifted, and when he did a warmth came off him that wasn't weather. It wasn't the cup. It wasn't the alley. It was him, and if Evan had been an animal he would have sidled closer to it and then hated himself for that. \"I wanted you to be in a room where making a world does not ask for blood.\"\n\nEvan, who had been about to smile something away, stopped. \"What do you mean,\" he said, but not like a question.\n\n\"I mean, you go up and you make a world every time, and that world demands a tithe. Sometimes the tithe is coffee and sleep. Sometimes it's something else. I wanted to put you in a world that took softer currency for a while.\"\n\nHe looked at Colm, for the first time that day looked all the way. \"You talk like a man who's always selling. But it's for me, isn't it. The sell is to me.\"\n\n\"Most of my selling is for me,\" Colm said with that little sideways offense at himself that made him charming. \"This one, I think I get nothing from. Except you.\"\n\n\"Leave it to you to make that sound like a trick.\" He paused. \"Thanks.\"\n\n\"You don't have to thank me,\" Colm said, which was always suspicious. He reached up and absently plucked at the brick with his nails. Dust made a small cloud that was golden for a second. He smiled at it like a king.\n\nEvan was tired. Tired in the way that isn't sleep but weight. He thought suddenly of those pictures that used to be in science books, of a drop of red magnified, those smooth coins of cells, stacks of them like gummy candy. He felt the room of himself shift. He put his hand on the brick.\n\n\"Don't faint on me,\" Colm said, but lightly.\n\n\"I'm not,\" Evan said; then, surprising himself, he said, \"Stay.\"\n\n\"I am not leaving,\" Colm said, and something in his voice said, I don't.\n\nLater, he would try to remember if any of this had been a clue, if any of this had laid down a strand that could make a net he could pull himself with. He would think of Colm's heat like a foundry, of the way the alley had gone very quiet as if even pigeons had held their breath. He would think of Tess saying \"blessing\" like she meant it. He would think of the way, on State Street that night, a dog had crossed in front of them and bowed, a solemn, strange bow, before running into the dark.\n\nFor now, he breathed next to his brother who was also a stranger and tried to outlast a feeling that had a face and a name. He was at the beginning. He didn't know that yet. He tilted his head and listened to the theater under his feet, the way you listen to a plane: not to what it is doing, but to the change in what it is doing.\n\n\"Places,\" Tess called from inside, her voice carrying like a cathedral bell through the brick. The word sounded different, like someone had hung a ribbon on it. Evan wiped his hand on his jeans. He went in. He turned one light to half, and then another, and then let the dark take the edges. He found the \"Go\" with his thumb without looking, the way you find the pulse in your own wrist when you want to know if you're still here. He clicked. The stage breathed, and the story, whatever it was, came toward him with open hands.On the third day he learned how to be a clock. That was what Tess called it when she walked him through the paper tech, a ritual that made theater people look like accountants and feel like generals. They sat at a folding table that had seen other wars and marked time in pencil. The table was covered with paper: the script printed large and broken into blocks, the light cues written in the margins in Tess\u2019s loping hand, sound cues in block letters as if naming them could keep them from going feral. Around them the actors sprawled on the stairs like cats that had agreed to be human for a while. Vee had a pen she stuck behind her ear and forgot and then went searching for, accusing the air of theft. The tall man with the hat had placed the hat on his knee like an old dog. Sophie, who was small and precise, was sewing something that might have been a sleeve or might have been a metaphor; her needle made tiny audible tsks as it moved. Tess tapped the script with a pencil that had teeth dents in it and said, \u201cThis is where you become the heartbeat. I say \u2018Standby\u2019, you say \u2018Lights standing by\u2019 and \u2018Sound standing by,\u2019 and then I say \u2018Go\u2019 and you move the world. If the world does not move we pretend we meant it. That is ninety percent of the job. The other ten percent is making people drink water and putting out little fires I start.\u201d\n\nHe liked the formality, because it gave his body something to dress itself in. There was relief in being allowed to be literal. He drew a little box in his notebook each time a cue happened, just to see it appear. He wrote \u201cLX\u201d for lights and \u201cSND\u201d for sounds and \u201cPRJ\u201d for the projector they insisted was not a projector but an instrument, and then he found himself shading them like a child fills in a coloring book when he needs the edges to matter. He liked the way Tess handed him the baton without any ceremony and with all of it. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one looking at the whole,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich means you are allowed to be boring. Boring is underrated.\u201d\n\nThey went through \u201cRend\u201d on paper, and even just that felt like a kind of violence softened by instruction. It was a piece about tearing and mending, which was the kind of sentence that made Arthur\u2019s mouth twitch in disdain when he read it in the community calendar and then circled the showtime anyway. It had been built from interviews and arguments and an afternoon when the company had brought in old blankets and ripped them and then stitched them and then tried not to cry about things that were not blankets. There was a scene where Vee stood with a pair of scissors and did not cut anything while speaking a litany of all the times in her life she had wanted to open a seam and put her head in. There was a scene where the tall man in the hat told a story about his grandmother\u2019s hands, and he undressed the hat from his head and held it like a bowl and showed you it was empty, and then at the end of the scene he turned it over and something fell out you had not seen him put there. There was a section with a table and the kind of lights that look like they belong in an interrogation; Tess wanted those to blink and not blink, to threaten blinking. There was, in Act Two, they insisted on calling it Act Two though no one sat long enough to deserve Greek, a sequence with red fabric that moved like water when six of them moved together, a river that was actually six arms and something about bodies making bodies.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Tess said, her pencil on a line that said in his own looping handwriting, because she had made him write it, INFINITE RED FABRIC ENTERS LIKE A SECRET. \u201cYou will want to go early because it\u2019s beautiful. Don\u2019t. Let them carry it to you.\u201d\n\nHe swallowed and nodded and wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t help beauty,\u201d which made Vee look over his shoulder and laugh without cruelty. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right, Captain,\u201d she said, calling him that like a joke she knew still had teeth in it.\n\nThey did spacing, which was less about space than about watching bodies learn to trust tape. He learned a new palette of words. \u201cSpike\u201d was a piece of tape telling a table where it would be later; \u201cspiking\u201d became holy. \u201cHold\u201d was what you said when someone was about to die or when a chair leg made an awful sound; when you said \u201cHold,\u201d the air obeyed you. Tess gave him the \u201cHold\u201d with a look, like you might give someone you like the keys to your car because you think their nervousness will keep them from doing stupid things. \u201cYou don\u2019t say it to feel large,\u201d she told him in the dark between cues, where their faces glowed with emergency light and a feeling like belonging. \u201cYou say it because something needs you to.\u201d\n\nAt lunch he followed Vee out the side door into the sliver of alley that pretended it was a patio if you squinted. The sun made a rectangle on the asphalt like a trap you would gladly walk into and then stand in forever. She had a sandwich whose bread looked too good for someone who said \u201cI\u2019m broke\u201d as if that were a choice she had made with pride. He had the last of one of June\u2019s soups in a jar and a plastic spoon with a crack like a fault line. They leaned against the dumpster the way you lean against a problem and decide you will not be the one to solve it but you will keep it company. Vee said, \u201cTess told me something but I think she told everyone because she is nosy and also kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did that change in the universe,\u201d he asked, aiming for lightness and landing close enough.\n\n\u201cThat you flew,\u201d Vee said, \u201cand that you\u2019re not flying because your head remembered something it didn\u2019t want to remember. She said you\u2019re not a hero. She meant it like a compliment. We don\u2019t have much use for them here.\u201d\n\nHe ate a spoon of soup and felt its heat slide down like a truce. \u201cI like jobs where I\u2019m a hinge,\u201d he said. \u201cYou turn me and a thing opens. That\u2019s all. Pilots get told we\u2019re gods because people don\u2019t think about the plane when it\u2019s doing what they want. I liked being the hinge better.\u201d\n\nVee nodded like someone who collected nods. \u201cI used to want to be the door,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I was. It was too much. Everyone coming through. Everyone slamming you when they were angry. Hinges get to hide.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like a vow,\u201d he said. He wanted to ask her what she had been the door to, but he had learned enough about Vee in three days to know she counted questions given to her and returned change later.\n\nBack inside, they started again. He stood behind the board. He found that there was a prayer in \u201cStandby,\u201d especially when Tess made the word a sigh and not an order. \u201cStandby cue thirty-one through thirty-eight,\u201d she said, and in the booth his treble repeated it, and in repeating it turned it into something that would happen. At cue forty-two they had their first accident, which Tess took like a gift from some god she didn\u2019t believe in because it meant they had met that god early in the run.\n\n\u201cHold,\u201d said the universe, except it was the tall man slaughtering his alphabet in a cough that was more like a bark. He had knelt to adjust a piece of tape he had decided he didn\u2019t like and came up too fast. The hat let out a little exclamation point and fell. He put a hand to his face and then took it down and there was, inevitable and delicate and unstoppable, a slickness under his nostrils that gleamed before it fell.\n\nEvan did not know an amount of red could be so precise and so ruinous at once. It wasn\u2019t a gush, it wasn\u2019t the obscene hand that had spread across a windshield, but his body didn\u2019t consult nuance. His chest unlaced itself and tried to leave; his vision contracted to a tunnel that saw only that one drop. He had an absurd thought that if he could make it not drop he would be back in the plane before the shudder, before the spray. He put his hand on the console and felt the hard edges of faders like banisters. Tess\u2019s voice reached him from a far country that was one step away. She was saying \u201cHold,\u201d and then she was saying \u201cHouse to half please,\u201d and then she was in the aisle, and then she was a hand on the tall man\u2019s arm, and then she was elbows and cloth and people breathing the breath of what now.\n\nHe heard himself say \u201cHold,\u201d late and echoing, like he\u2019d heard himself say it the first time he had told a plane to stop. The word entered him and moved the air, and the moving air did a tiny thing to his rib cage: it reminded his ribs that they, too, were banisters. He took a breath and felt only half of it, which was more than a quarter and thus counted as progress. He reached blindly for the headset that hung on a nail, because if he could put something over his ears it would be like putting his mother\u2019s palm on his head, that old warmth.\n\n\u201cFirst aid kit?\u201d Vee said from somewhere to his left, and he could hear in her voice that she wanted to catch it, the drop, with words, and that words were not cups.\n\n\u201cGreen room, top of the fridge,\u201d Sophie said, and already her feet were making that sneaker squeak that made all of this seem like a cartoon that would hurt only if you looked sideways at it.\n\nThe tall man said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine, it always does this,\u201d and he sounded like that at every nosebleed for his whole life, that apology shape. Someone handed him a cloth that used to be white, because every theatre had an item that used to be white and had surrendered. Blood made a dot and then a bigger dot. The iron smell that science says you do not actually smell because smell is not iron but your brain\u2019s idea of iron arrived like a memory of pennies. Evan\u2019s wrist throbbed the way it had in the cockpit when Magda had used that perilous voice.\n\n\u201cHead down, pinch the bridge,\u201d Tess said, and then, \u201cDon\u2019t tilt back, you\u2019re not trying to irrigate your throat,\u201d and then to Sophie, \u201cGloves, get him gloves because we\u2019re pretending to be professionals.\u201d\n\nEvan found himself gripping the board. He told his heart, absurdly, that he would be with it in a moment. He opened the drawer to his right\u2014Sheila\u2019s drawer of things she hadn\u2019t yet sorted and would now be his to sort\u2014and found tape and cough drops and a box of nitrile. He put a glove on because doing one thing he had done before could sometimes persuade the body to follow; he had put on gloves in planes and in kitchens and when Arthur had taught him to sand a board just so. The glove snapped around his wrist with a sound that took the room into its mouth and softened its corners. He moved down the steps like a man in a pool, determined to reach the other side. He crouched by the tall man, who was saying he was fine and whose face contradicted that in a dozen little shards.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Evan said, his voice without echo, \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d He could feel the tremor in his own hand, a low rpm hum. He could also feel the weight of what this was, which was not an emergency in any universe where they had invented words for real emergencies. He put the glove on himself and then got the tall man to tilt forward just enough that the body could do the job it had always done. He pinched with the tall man\u2019s fingers, counting in a quiet rote that surprised him: \u201cOne two three four,\u201d as if there were a lever that wanted to come up at two hundred. \u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it. Stay with us.\u201d\n\nVee handed him a cold compress from a little packet that must have lived in that green room\u2019s nest for years. He pressed it gently to the bridge with his knuckles so he didn\u2019t have to look straight at the red that was not yet red, that was still a wetness. The tall man\u2019s breath slowed, and in the slowing there was a sound like rails taken up out of the road when winter ends. The dot on the cloth quit its ambition and went ordinary. The iron smell did its quiet exit, the way smells leave as if insulted you noticed them in the first place.\n\n\u201cLook at that,\u201d Tess said, her praise a dry palm. \u201cA man who takes a command. Can we keep you in the booth and also in the apocalypse.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly if I get to write the checklist,\u201d he said, breath returning in increments. His knee hurt from the crouch and he welcomed the hurt like a hand on his shoulder. He handed the compress to the tall man, who was called Marcus, he remembered then, because it mattered now. \u201cYou good?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed,\u201d Marcus said, as if that were a diagnosis. \u201cI always, if it\u2019s dry and then I bend too fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cHydrate,\u201d Sophie said, the way someone says \u201crepent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in ten,\u201d Tess announced to the room at large, as if she hadn\u2019t already stolen back the ten with her competence. She looked at Evan while everyone dispersed, and he saw in her face that relief that is tinged with guilt: you thanked whatever had made the accident small and given you a chance to practice your kindness, and you hated that you were the sort of animal who could be grateful for proof of your own capacities.\n\nHe went back up to the booth and did not sit until he could sit ordinary. He put his hands flat on the console and let the ridges of the fader track press lines into his palms, geography he could carry into the next room. The word \u201cbleed,\u201d which had been a siren, subsided into the background noise of language. He felt a small swell of pride, and then a wash of shame at the pride, and then he allowed both to be there because he could not spend his life refusing emotions their passports.\n\nThey resumed, and the red fabric sequence came later, and it was, to his horror and pleasure, as beautiful as he had feared. The six of them came in with the cloth pooled in their hands, and for a second it looked insolent and dead. Then they lifted and the thing became a river, it became a weather system, it became every curtain you had ever hidden behind and every artery that had ever pumped and every flag you had ever been asked to salute and couldn\u2019t. It moved like he wished he felt: continuously, without snag, making a surface for light to play on. He did not go early, as instructed. He waited until Tess\u2019s breath next to him changed, a slight click in it, and then he pressed \u201cGo\u201d and the low side light turned the red into a kind of velvet dream. He might have closed his eyes for a second because in the dark he imagined the cockpit again, the purple-grey of cloud when the warning light is on and you have to decide. When he opened them he was still in the booth and Marcus was not bleeding and Vee was not cutting anything with her scissors that were always a threat and never the weapon.\n\nAt dinner home was a great blousy bowl of spaghetti made by a woman who thought of pasta as a moral stance. June had sauce on her wrist and didn\u2019t notice for twenty minutes because she was telling a story about a man at the bank who had made her laugh by sneezing exactly like a puppy. Arthur pretended not to be charmed and then told them how much money the bank had made off people who couldn\u2019t subtract and then made himself a policeman of garlic bread. Colm arrived late, not because he could not arrive on time but because he believed time was a curve he could lean against and then straighten with his hands. He set a paper bag on the counter like an apology for what he would be later. It contained olives in a container that leaked and two kinds of cheese June would approve of because they didn\u2019t call themselves anything. Colm kissed June\u2019s cheek and touched Arthur\u2019s shoulder with a knuckle. He looked at Evan over the steam like this was another show they had both wandered into without tickets.\n\n\u201cHow is the church,\u201d Arthur said to him, and then to Evan, for explanation, \u201cHe ministers to the theater people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a deacon of poor decisions,\u201d Colm said. He snagged an olive with his fingers and chewed it in a way that made you think olive should pay him rent. \u201cYour boy distinguished himself today.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have informants,\u201d Evan said, and Vee would have liked the way he made the word a dare.\n\n\u201cI have eyes that tell me things,\u201d Colm said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t run out of the back of the room and leave a cartoon cutout of yourself in the door. You did a small good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a nose,\u201d Evan said, and then the words surprised him, came unbidden, \u201cIt was not a wing.\u201d He could feel the minute temperature shift that came when you told a room what had hurt you last. Arthur looked at him and did not say a thing. June did the little frown she did when she was about to say too much and then chose not to, an art she had had to practice. Colm nodded as if mentally moving a bead on an abacus.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Colm said lightly to the table in general, \u201ca man will come and ask me to find a dog.\u201d\n\nThis was how he was; he dropped a sentence like a small explosive and then watched you not react, and then he knew who you were. June said, \u201cThere are posters,\u201d practical, a mother to all lost domesticated creatures.\n\n\u201cThey want a particular dog,\u201d Colm said. \u201cA dog that has learned to open the latch on the backyard gate with his teeth. The man says he loves the dog and I believe him because he stopped for a full two seconds in his telling and looked like someone took his throat away.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what is this to you,\u201d Arthur said, though he was smiling despite himself, because he liked to pretend he was immune to Colm and then wake up to having driven him to a thing and waited with the engine running.\n\n\u201cThis is how I make rent,\u201d Colm said, so open you almost forgot to be angry. \u201cI find dear things for people who lost them. Sometimes it is a dog. Sometimes it is a ring they never owned in the first place and will sell to feel noble. Sometimes it is a way to leave without breaking a window. Sometimes it is a furnace repairman who won\u2019t charge three hundred dollars to come and press a reset button. People don\u2019t know how to ask. They know how to list. I like turning lists into requests.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fixer,\u201d Arthur said, professional disgust nicely sanded with affection.\n\n\u201cI am a pointer,\u201d Colm said. He bowed his head to the bowl like he thought it was holy. \u201cI stand in a room and sometimes the air moves for me. It\u2019s ridiculous, really. Do you have more bread, June.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner, when Arthur washed dishes in his methodical way and June triaged the dry with a towel she swore made plates shinier than the machine, Colm stood at the back door like he\u2019d been asked to guard the night. Evan went out with him into the hum. Fireflies began to assert themselves in the yard, insolent punctuation. The neighbor\u2019s maple was a gossipy silhouette. The air had that sugary thickness Ohio got when it remembered the cornfields around it and decided to marinate you.\n\nColm lit a cigarette and then passed it to Evan, and Evan made a face but took it because it was old and stupid and had a taste like some memory he couldn\u2019t name. He didn\u2019t smoke, which was why in moments like this he did; he liked choosing his poisons when the others were choosing him. Colm watched the smoke lift like a thought having second thoughts.\n\n\u201cI saw a thing today,\u201d Colm said finally, in that way he had of making the thing he was about to say feel like an ethical problem rather than a story. \u201cI wanted your take, which is either rich or pathetic depending on the hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs if my take is anything,\u201d Evan said, blowing smoke into a shape and then being ashamed of himself for enjoying the shape.\n\n\u201cDowntown, the new coffee place that believes chairs should be a lesson,\u201d Colm said. \u201cA boy was standing with a leaflet in his fingers and talking to a woman who had turned her face away. He was talking softly, which is a trick, and he was making the leaflet into a promise. He said the word family four times and the word tired once. I wanted to stand between them because the leaflet had too many exclamation points. I wanted to ask the boy who was tired, him or the woman, because that matters. And then\u2014\u201d He paused, not for effect, but to be exact. \u201cThen the boy flinched at nothing. Like the air hit him. He looked past the woman for a second, and then he folded the leaflet backwards and he left it on the counter like a tip. The woman cried in the coffee smell and then ordered a drink that was nothing but sugar and milk. I saw that and I thought, I can stand in rooms and point all day, but sometimes the room points back.\u201d\n\nEvan considered that. The fireflies made grammar of the yard. \u201cMaybe the room has better manners than we do,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the room knows when a thing is too much to carry.\u201d\n\nColm smiled. \u201cThat is comforting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also a little sad. I prefer the version where something in the room grows teeth when I ask it to.\u201d He dropped the cigarette and squashed it with his toe and then, because he was himself, put the stub in the little tin June kept for that purpose as if he had been born knowing to respect tins.\n\nThey were quiet for a while. The quiet between them had become something new; it was not the silence of two boys in different corners of the same house, it was not the silence of two men who hadn\u2019t met each other properly yet. It was a silence that was a bridge under construction, ropes being thrown, a little sway, a little triumph at every knot.\n\nThe next day Tess made them do the show with everything but an audience. \u201cIt\u2019s called a dress rehearsal, though god forbid anyone wears anything nice,\u201d she said. She had a knack for making you feel like you were part of a tradition older than your birth and also brand-new. They put on the lights in the order he had memorized. He wrote a small prayer for himself in the margins of the cue sheet: \u201cStandby to not panic.\u201d He put his pen behind his ear and then reached for it and it wasn\u2019t there, and he laughed to himself because of Vee, because he had borrowed her habit and found it empty. At the half-hour he said \u201cHalf hour\u201d into a microphone that made his voice sound like a version of himself he could trust. The word traveled through hallways and stairwells and touched people he couldn\u2019t see. He thought of departure gates and the way certain words make bodies move. He thought of Magda\u2019s hand on his wrist and of the maintenance man\u2019s rag and of the ridiculous grace of a nose bleeding itself out. He stood in the booth and thought he might be almost fine. This was not a promise. It was a place to stand.\n\nThey ran. In Act One, Vee\u2019s scissors flashed, and the light caught an old nick on her knuckle that had scarred itself into a white comma. He wanted to ask what it had been; he wanted to say, \u201cMe too,\u201d even though his comma lived in a place the light had a hard time finding. In Act One, a prop glass rolled and showed its dirty bottom and Marcus kicked it softly toward its spike without looking and Evan loved him for that. In Act One, Tess said \u201cGo\u201d three beats later than he would have, and he learned something about patience he let creep into his bones.\n\nBetween Acts, a young man from the back of house brought in a tub of liquid with the caution of someone who had been given a baby and a bomb. \u201cBlood,\u201d he announced, because in theater you called a thing by its name so there would be no surprise later when it stained. The tub was cheap plastic and had a lid with a snap. The stuff inside was opaque maroon, too much chocolate syrup, a tug of corn. He had to test it, Tess said, because they would flick a finger into it in Act Two and paint a line on a cloth, a symbolic thing that would read as obvious if it were the wrong viscosity.\n\nHe looked at the tub the way you look at an ex you haven\u2019t seen since you were a worse person. He took a breath and opened the snap and let the smell meet his face. It smelled like midnights in kitchens, like pancakes at three a.m. It smelled like children. He found that the part of him that had braced for iron stood down except for the guards who were never off. He stirred with a paint stick and watched the surface pull and let go. Vee came to stand next to him and did not crowd him. She dipped her finger as if she were baptizing herself into mischief. She painted a line on the air, then wiped it on a cloth, and the cloth accepted it. \u201cLooks like a cartoon,\u201d she said. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because relief had that shape in him. \u201cI can do cartoons,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t like realism.\u201d She looked at him out of the corner of her eye as if testing whether he knew he had made a joke and taken some of the sting out of it.\n\n\u201cThanks for yesterday,\u201d Marcus said an hour later, passing him a coffee as if bribing him to be nice again. \u201cThat was\u2014 I hate it, you know, when my body decides to be stupid in public.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all hate that,\u201d Evan said, accepting the coffee and trying to like it as much as the kindness. He took a sip and grimaced because the cup thought it was coffee and was lying. Marcus laughed a little and patted his arm awkwardly and then went to find his hat, which he had mislaid again in the exact place Tess had told him not to.\n\nBy Friday, the day they would let a real roomful of strangers enter and turn them into an audience, the Evergreen had taken on that humming-jelly quality that theaters get when they are about to be genuine. The lobby had been mopped within an inch of its life and somehow still smelled like shoe. The bathrooms had been attended to with a brush and an ancient rag; Sophie had folded the paper towels into a triangle because she believed in small excellences even in rooms where no one cared. Tess walked around with a roll of gaff tape stuck to her wrist like a bracelet of authority. Evan put fresh batteries in mics and then put fresh batteries next to the fresh ones because he had learned that gods shriek without warning. He called the half and then the fifteen and then the five and each time the numbers felt realer, like going down in an airplane and seeing real houses.\n\nAt five, June and Arthur showed up in seats they had not paid for because Tess had growled that she would murder anyone who sold a comp to the mother of the new boy who saved a nose. June gooey-eyed the space as if it were the crib of a new baby and not a room that had held more ghosts than babies. Arthur sat as if he had never allowed a chair to tell him where to put his legs. Colm arrived two minutes before lights out, because he would never miss an entrance if someone would clap. He stood in the back at first, a habit, then took a seat when he realized someone else would take it. He had dressed in a sweater that women had probably knitted for him with their eyes. He watched Evan\u2019s booth like he could see through walls. When the lights went to half he became a shape in the dark that was in on a joke.\n\nThey started. The tiny edge of fear became a wave and then a lake and then a table he could set a drink on. He said \u201cStandby\u201d and they stood by. He said \u201cGo\u201d and the going happened. In the alley the night before he had told Colm he was a hinge; now he felt like a switch on the body of the theater, one of those small slick toggles with ridges meant for blind fingers. He listened to the audience laugh in a place where he had expected them to and not laugh where he had hoped they might; he listened to the intake of breath when the red fabric river happened, which was sound enough to pay everyone in the room for a week if they lived on breath. He did not mess up a single cue; that sentence was his and he took it home in his mouth and held it there for later when he would need something sweet.\n\nAfter the show the room did that sloppy slow-motion celebration theaters love: someone clapped too long in a sincere way that made someone else uncomfortable; a man hugged the wrong person; a woman cried and made it funny. Stranger faces came up the aisle and told Tess what the show had done to them, as if Tess were God and had to be told. June hugged three actors and told them she had seen their souls, which, coming from her, sounded like a thing she could actually do. Arthur found a chair and told it about a lighting cue he would have done differently because he could not help himself. Colm stood in a spot the light found and let it and did not apologize.\n\nEvan stood at the rail of the booth until his hands stopped wanting work. He looked at Vee, who was being congratulated by a woman with a jaw like judgment, and Vee endured it like someone who had decided not to be cut by certain knives anymore. He could feel in his pocket the slip of paper Tess had given him with three words on it, the first he had been paid in besides drink tickets: \u201cYou belong here.\u201d It was a trap and it was a gift and he had no idea how to unwrap it.\n\nOn the walk home with Colm through the soft-drunk summer streets, someone they didn\u2019t know stepped into their path and stepped back and then stepped in again, an indecision like a dance move invented by accident. He was a man of the kind Arthur called a \u201cpunctuation person\u201d\u2014someone who appeared in life like a comma and a question mark at once. He had the wiry look of a person who had never met a straight line. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re him,\u201d to Colm, and Colm\u2019s back did something small, a readiness, but his face stayed as open as a church door.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Colm said. \u201cDepends on the hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a thing wants you,\u201d the man said. He looked at Evan too as if measuring his ability to be useful or to ruin something by breathing on it. He had a smell about him, sweat and night and old, old books.\n\n\u201cThere are always things,\u201d Colm said lightly, and the light in his voice was a screen door that would slam shut if you were not careful.\n\n\u201cThis one is related to your boy,\u201d the man said, and the way he said \u201cboy\u201d was older than the streetlights. \u201cYou know the river, the one with the rocks that racket like teeth. Something left a mark by the bridge. A red. A making. It isn\u2019t the usual paint. it isn\u2019t church. It\u2019s the other. They want you because you\u2019re small enough to ask and big enough to see. And if you don\u2019t, it keeps asking.\u201d\n\nEvan felt it as a cold at the base of his skull, not his blood thing, not his pilot thing either, a new tremor that belonged to his bones. He looked at Colm and saw that the warmth around him had turned from a summer thing to a cookfire. Colm laughed, a sound like a man being polite to a god who has just appeared in the wrong shirt. \u201cTell whoever \u2018they\u2019 are that I\u2019ll walk by the bridge after I tuck in the kid,\u201d he said, and he said \u201ckid\u201d and the man looked at Evan like he was a puzzle he did not want to solve.\n\n\u201cIf it spreads,\u201d the man said, \u201cand it will, you\u2019ll wish you went when asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone always does,\u201d Colm said softly. \u201cRun along. Drink water. Don\u2019t look straight at what the sky is doing tonight.\u201d\n\nThe man went; he didn\u2019t really go, he diminished until he was part of the block and then part of the block\u2019s memory. Evan stood and put his hands in his pockets because he hadn\u2019t known what else to do since he was thirteen. \u201cIs this your other work,\u201d he said, not keeping all the skepticism out of his voice, because if something was going to be nonsense he wanted to know before he had to clean up after it.\n\n\u201cIt is all the same work,\u201d Colm said, so tired in that moment that Evan wanted to put a blanket on his shoulders and tell him to sit. \u201cPeople misplace things. Dogs, rings, courage. Sometimes the things misplace themselves. Sometimes the road ruins the road and you have to ask it to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d Evan said, because his body had a reflex and it was to push away the idea that rooms pointed back.\n\n\u201cI am an instrument,\u201d Colm said, and for one sliver of a second his eyes did that molten trick and for one sliver of a second Evan knew what it would be to be a room that had just been asked. Then Colm\u2019s face closed again, and he was only a man in a sweater. \u201cCome if you want. Stay if you\u2019re saner than me.\u201d\n\nEvan wanted, which surprised him. He wanted to stand by a river and see whether the water could talk. He wanted to be with his brother even if his brother was about to walk into a nonsense he had made up to survive himself. He also wanted to go to bed and make himself a small person under a quilt in a house where June left lights on like wards. He was two men and a boy and a hinge and a switch and a person who wanted to be bored. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll walk,\u201d and heard how his voice made it sound like a fact.\n\nThey went down past the storefronts with their names like herbs and apothecaries, past the bar where Max sometimes sat on his one night off and pretended not to be dispatch. The night had a bruise in it. The river announced itself before they could see it; it had a mouth the town had taught it to use. When they got to the bridge, a municipal thing that had dipped its toes in history and then been replaced and then dipped again, Evan felt the hairs on his arms decide they had been painted on. He saw, under the bright mean light, a mark. It was at the place where teenagers wrote their names and then pretended it was their fates. It looked like paint in that it was red, but not the red you buy at Lowe\u2019s because it matches your idea of barn. It had that weird blue in it that real red has. It was also dry and also looked wet. It had been spread with a hand by someone who had never spread paint before on purpose.\n\nColm stepped closer and then stopped with respect like you stop at the edge of a sanctuary when you don\u2019t know where the candles are. He did not put his hand out. Good, Evan thought, because if you touch the stupid thing I will have to carry you home and explain to June that you died of idiot. The cord in the back of Colm\u2019s hand stood up anyway, like it wanted to try the dark. \u201cSomeone made a door,\u201d Colm said, and he said it matter-of-fact the way you might say \u201cThe soffit is rotten.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to close doors. They\u2019ll say they didn\u2019t mean it and then act hurt when the wind comes in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to get you a rag,\u201d Evan said, a blend of mockery and care that had been their pattern since the first time they had shared a bathroom. \u201cYou want me to pretend this is paint and you want to scrape.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to stand where you\u2019re standing,\u201d Colm said, and the voice\u2014there it was\u2014thickened, gained a grain. \u201cYou make rooms steady. It helps.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lunatic,\u201d Evan said, with love, and took half a step anyway into the posture of a man who has decided he can catch something if it falls. He looked at the mark and hated it for looking like a hand he had seen on glass. He could feel a pulse under the bridge in the water or in himself; he could not tell which and laughed quietly because distinction is for days off.\n\nColm took a breath, big and slow. He reached into his pocket and brought out not a rag but a stub of chalk like a teacher who doesn\u2019t want to teach your child so much as draw a protective circle around her. He drew on the concrete next to the red without touching it. He drew a shape that was humble, a circle with a little dent in it, like a cup under a drip. He muttered, and Evan realized with a shock that he had heard the words before. They were a child\u2019s nonsense about not letting the bogeyman under the bed: \u201cStay out, stay there, stay in your house.\u201d He had said it when he was eight while June brushed his hair and he had asked about his father. How did Colm know it. How did Colm have a piece of their kitchen in his mouth.\n\nThe chalk line wasn\u2019t much. It was already smeared from the damp that lived under a bridge. But when Colm finished the little circle and put the chalk back in his pocket and exhaled, some awful pressure in the air gave up its little show of power and went off to find a lazier boy to bother. The red looking-wet looked less wet, because the world had decided not to stare at it. The river made a little satisfied sound, as if a pebble had been moved to a better place.\n\n\u201cYou and your toys,\u201d Evan said, the words as a way to not say what he had felt.\n\n\u201cYou and your buttons,\u201d Colm said back, smiling that crooked his good teeth could not fix.\n\nThey walked home without speaking about it. Near the house, the dog from the previous night crossed in front of them and bowed again, as if it had taken the night class and learned to greet kings. Evan wanted to apologize to the animal for all the people he had been and not been. He wanted to say to the world, I am trying. June had left the porch light on. It made a small pool on the boards. He stepped into that pool and felt, for the second time in as many days, that his body belonged to him in a way that might last for the space of a cup of tea.\n\nIn bed, with the window cracked and the Ohio summer wanting in, he did not dream of birds or of red or of chalk. He dreamed of a switch, the old kind with a Bakelite knob, ridged under his thumb. He dreamed that the switch was part of a machine he could not see all of and that somehow, impossibly, when he pressed it, two rooms lit at once: the theater and the cockpit, one light warmer than the other, both good. In the morning he would wake and make coffee and be someone who went to work; not the work everyone expected, not the work he had thought would always be the only thing for him, but work nonetheless. He would measure his day in standbys and gos, in breath and in chalk, in the ordinary acquaintance of people who did not expect to find god but were not insulted when a small god found them anyway. He would walk into the Evergreen and be the man who made the dark happen on purpose and then bring it up, who let a story come and put its hand out and not flinch when it did. He would, because he had no other way, listen for the change.By morning the bridge felt like an idea he could have dreamed, the way small dangerous things do when you place a window between them and the sun. June put eggs on a plate like she always had and told him a story about a neighbor who had planted zinnias in a circle so tight the flowers were suffocating each other and how she\u2019d walked over with a spoon and separated them gently as if they were toddlers, and Arthur argued with the weather on television as if its predictions were personal slurs. Colm looked the same and not the same, the warmth around him banked but insistent, and he picked up his coffee with both hands the way he did when something had tugged at his edges in the night. Evan let the ordinary make its case, nodded when June told him to take a banana because potassium was not optional, and pretended not to watch his brother for signs of anything a language didn\u2019t have words for yet.\n\nHe walked to the theater alone because he wanted to see the town in daylight after standing under its bridge at midnight, and because it felt like a dare he could win without anyone witnessing the wobble in his step. The baristas at the corner place were children with rings in places his grandmother would have called delicate; one of them had a bandage at his knuckle and the sight of the dirty gauze made Evan\u2019s throat dip and rise like a fish. He bought coffee and did not look at the drip on the lid that made a small Rosetta of brown on the white; he wiped it with his sleeve and told himself that whatever ritual that was, it was his to choose. Inside the Evergreen Tess had a roll of tickets around her wrist and a pen behind her ear and the aura of a woman about to commit to a battle that would end in confetti and bills, and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re early in a way that makes me think you slept badly, which is fine, I slept like an ambassador between two warring states.\u201d\n\nThey walked the building together the way pilots walk a plane, touching things not because touch changes them but because touch tells you when change has already happened. Tess bent and ran her fingers along the edge of the stage and came up with a splinter that she kissed and put on her tongue because that was the sort of superstition that was half a laugh and half a sacrament. Evan checked the light board and the sound levels and the prop cabinet that wanted to be a closet someday and found his own handwriting where Tess had made him make it yesterday, his capital letters more certain than he felt. Vee arrived with wet hair and a book under her arm that said \u201cBirds of Ohio\u201d as if words could domesticate their subjects, and when she saw him she nodded without flourishes and said, \u201cYou all right,\u201d in a tone that made it easy to tell the truth.\n\n\u201cI am a man held together by tape,\u201d he said, and she smiled without breaking stride and said, \u201cThen we\u2019re all spiritual cousins,\u201d and disappeared to argue with a costume that had decided to be silk when it had been bought as cotton. The smallness of the day steadied him, a list he could put into his mouth and swallow without choking. He said \u201cHalf hour\u201d into the microphone and liked the power of it; he said \u201cFifteen\u201d and tried not to think of gates and boarding groups; he said \u201cFive\u201d and felt his heart settle into a tempo that had nothing to do with engines and everything to do with intention.\n\nThe second night brought different strangers, and strangers are always different in their sameness. A woman in the third row wore a cardigan like armor and let herself cry when the red fabric moved as if her body had been waiting for permission; an older man laughed at a line about grandmothers as if laughter were a rebellion he could still afford. Evan took them in as a single creature with a hundred heads, an animal that needed to be led to water and told it was allowed to drink. He fumbled a sound cue by a breath and nobody died; Tess squeezed his shoulder afterward as if to reward him for being human in public. He felt the familiar urge to apologize for an error he\u2019d trained entire systems out of, and he stepped on it like a lit match and let it smoke and be nothing.\n\nAfter the show they stood in the green room that wasn\u2019t, a rectangle with a microwave that had gone to college twice and a couch that had acquired a reputation. Marcus handed around grapes as if he were Santa reinvented as a fruit bowl and Vee ate them with a precision that made you think she had rules about spheres. Tess counted the cash in the donation jar with her lips moving and said something rude about the generosity of people who would spend fifteen dollars on a drink and bring her three in crumpled bills, but she said it with love, like a mother scolding a thief who steals for reasons she understands. Evan sat on a flight case and let the buzz run out of him the way carbonation does when you let a bottle breathe, and when he looked up he saw that Colm was in the doorway again as if the building had asked him to be one of its doorframes.\n\n\u201cGood house,\u201d Colm said to Tess, and Tess snorted and said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen worse and I\u2019ve seen it with mildew,\u201d and then she turned to Evan and said, \u201cYour voice for the \u2018Standby\u2019 is getting lower, which makes everyone calm, so keep drinking coffee or whatever makes you less of a boy, but not so much that you start thinking you\u2019re in charge of anything.\u201d Evan said, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d and Vee said, \u201cHe\u2019s an agreeable hinge,\u201d and the word made him grin in a way that felt like a borrowed coat that fit better than expected.\n\nThey walked out into the alley under a sky that was doing that thing Ohio skies do where they look like they\u2019ve been ironed by someone who resented the chore. The news vans had gone to cover something that wasn\u2019t art, and the dumpsters smelled like bread and ghosts; someone had painted over a tag on the brick with a patch of color that didn\u2019t match, and now the color was the tag. Colm looked thinner in the sodium light, the warmth of him drawn tight to save heat, and he said, \u201cBridge is quiet,\u201d before Evan could ask, and then he said, \u201cIt won\u2019t stay. But you have your show, so we will let polite things be polite and impolite things be less interesting for as long as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it when it isn\u2019t a mark,\u201d Evan asked, because his skepticism had the odd habit of turning into curiosity when he wasn\u2019t looking. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a door, I mean. What is it a door to.\u201d\n\n\u201cDepends who drew it and who made the first noise,\u201d Colm said, as if he were explaining traffic patterns. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a door to someone else\u2019s breath. Sometimes it\u2019s a door to the part of the town that doesn\u2019t like us. Sometimes it\u2019s nothing and I am a fool with chalk, which is my preferred diagnosis. Do your hands shake when you press \u2018Go\u2019 or are you a statue yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a statue someone put a motor in,\u201d Evan said, and Colm laughed, not because it was funny but because it was precise, and then he told Evan about a woman who had hired him to find her locket and had ended up finding her own patience instead, and the story ended with a cat that had adopted a plant and made it thrive. They stood in that spill of light that pretended to be safety and listened to the traffic two streets over argue with itself, and neither of them said the word blood because they didn\u2019t need to.\n\nThe next morning, Arthur found a notice on the neighborhood forum printed out by a neighbor who believed paper to be more real than screens, and he brought it to the table with the air of a man delivering a summons. The flier had a photo of a stencil on a brick wall, not the bridge exactly but the same hand, the same insistence on red, the line of a palm and the suggestion of fingers like a schoolchild\u2019s turkey drawing. The caption said, \u201cVandalism or art? Join the conversation,\u201d and there was a time and a place and the earnestness of people who want all problems to be solvable by chairs arranged in a circle. June clicked her tongue and said, \u201cIf they get me in a circle I\u2019ll stand up, you know I will,\u201d and Arthur said, \u201cThey will hate you for speaking plain,\u201d and June said, \u201cThey always do; I\u2019ll bring cookies.\u201d\n\nEvan looked at the picture and felt the same cartoon slide in his stomach he had felt at the bridge, smaller in daylight but there. Colm took the paper and looked at it long enough for the coffee to go cold and said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d like a judge pronouncing guilt with compassion. \u201cMost people who make doors don\u2019t intend to. They mean to hang a picture and they open the wall instead.\u201d He folded the paper neatly so the red hand was hidden and put it in his jacket pocket and said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll go to that conversation, don\u2019t you, June,\u201d and June gave him a look that combined all the ways she had of loving him and said, \u201cWe do not let the babies talk by themselves.\u201d\n\nTess hated meetings because meetings were two steps away from grants, and grants made her stomach acid perform acrobatics for audiences, but she went to this one because the theater had a stake in any red thing in this town. She wore a shirt that said \u201cGaffer Tape Is My Love Language,\u201d and when someone made a joke about it she let them and then talked about the cost of replacing bulbs in the work lights and everyone in the room watched her like they would buy her a bulb and a steak if they could. The gathering was held in a church basement that had learned to smell like coffee regardless of who was drinking it, and the chairs had been arranged in a circle that wanted to be a net. Vee came and took notes on a piece of paper she would later lose; Marcus brought the hat as if he thought it could serve as a talking stick; Sophie threaded a needle and did not comment. Evan sat near the back with Colm because he wanted to see who turned their heads when someone said \u201cdoor.\u201d\n\nThe town showed up like a family asked to discuss a will: eager, anxious, pretending they weren\u2019t thinking about what they\u2019d get to take home. A teacher spoke about art as provocation and her students who wanted to be seen and hadn\u2019t been; a man from the city muttered about property values and vandalism and hinted at fines like a magician forcing a card; a woman who worked at the pharmacy told a story about a boy who had come in with paint on his fingers and had asked for tape and gauze and had flinched when the automatic doors opened. June said, \u201cMaybe you make a person less lonely and they won\u2019t need to make the wall less lonely,\u201d and Arthur said, \u201cOr maybe you do both because people are complicated,\u201d and someone clapped and then apologized for clapping because the room had not signed a contract about applause.\n\nWhen it was Colm\u2019s turn\u2014or rather, when he made it his turn by standing and making the room admit he was tall\u2014he spoke in that voice of his that widened the aisles. He said, \u201cMaybe treat the walls like people, too. Maybe tell them you see them. Paint the thing you want to look at when you head home, and if it isn\u2019t a hand, all right. If it is, ask whose hand. Ask what it thinks it\u2019s reaching for.\u201d He didn\u2019t say the word door. He didn\u2019t say the words stay out or stay there or stay in your house. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t make a mark you can\u2019t clean,\u201d and the room took the sentence into itself like bread.\n\nA boy in the second row who had cut his hair to look like he had not tried spoke, his voice an apology and a dare. He said, \u201cIt was me,\u201d though no one had asked the question that bluntly, and the teachers in the room put their hands in their laps and decided not to rush forward to claim him. He said, \u201cI thought it would make a hole people could put their eyes in,\u201d and everyone except Evan heard this and thought he meant attention, and Evan heard this and thought he meant exactly what he said. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know it would smell,\u201d and at that word something in Evan\u2019s back teeth ached with the memory of rocket fuel that wasn\u2019t, with pennies that weren\u2019t, with the sweetness that had first made his heart bolt.\n\nAfter the meeting, which adjourned because the coffee ran out and the room had had its say, Evan walked with the boy out into the small social weather of the parking lot. Colm followed at a distance because he could be generous like that when it mattered. The boy picked at his thumb cuticle like it was responsible, and Evan recognized the age of the movement; he had been that age with wheels in his head and only one road inviting him. \u201cYou opened something you didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d Evan said, so even the boy could not misunderstand. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be careful now. You\u2019re going to clean what you can. You\u2019re going to draw things you can take back.\u201d\n\nThe boy looked at him like he had been told by a stranger that he had a father somewhere and that the father was neither hero nor villain but a man who knew how to tighten a bolt. \u201cDo you know how,\u201d he said, the vulnerable nakedness of the question making itself an animal between them. \u201cDo you know how to take back.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Evan said, and felt the shame of the sometimes like a perfume he didn\u2019t want and couldn\u2019t wash off. \u201cI know someone who knows. He\u2019s annoying and he\u2019s kind and he thinks chalk is a religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cChalk is for teachers,\u201d the boy said, bravado injecting itself like sugar, and Evan laughed and said, \u201cExactly,\u201d and he saw the boy picture a room with a blackboard and calm, and he saw the way that image tightened the strings in his neck and loosened others. Colm drifted close then, as if he had been invited by an invisible hands-clasp, and he said to the boy, \u201cCome by the Evergreen after five if you can stand the smell of sawdust married to ancient coffee. We\u2019ll show you where the doors are supposed to be.\u201d\n\nThe day after that the thing came inside, which was inevitable because everything loves an audience. It did not knock on the literal door or throw itself at the box office or demand a ticket; it came in on someone\u2019s shoes and someone else\u2019s breath and the idea that had been shaped at a bridge and a brick and a flier. It showed up as a pattern first, a series of small red thumbprints on the edge of a prop table, nothing grotesque, just the quiet residue of a hundred handled motions coalescing into an iris. Sophie made a noise in her throat and reached for a wipe; Tess said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d and Evan put his hand on the table and felt, absurdly, a faint pulse, as if the wood were reciting something it had just learned.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stop the rehearsal; he would not have dared, and besides, it would have been the wrong spell. He let the run go on and did his job and pressed \u201cGo\u201d and \u201cStop\u201d when asked and carried water to a person who had decided they never needed water and was wrong. At break he stood by the table with the red freckles and said, \u201cHold,\u201d not for the room, but to the idea that wanted to become larger. He said it softly and then said, \u201cStay,\u201d under his breath the way you say it to a dog in a shape you hope the dog likes. He found Sheila\u2019s old chalk in the drawer with her cough drops and a button shaped like a cat, and he drew the little cup shape next to the furthest smear and then another near the next. He did not draw circles around anything; he did not imprison. He drew places for things to go when they were tired of being mischief.\n\nVee watched him and said, \u201cWe let you play with the holy markers now,\u201d and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell Tess or she\u2019ll charge me a rental fee,\u201d and Vee said, \u201cShe\u2019ll charge you and then take you to lunch.\u201d She reached out without touching the chalk lines and said, \u201cWhat is it that you and your brother do when you\u2019re not selling tickets to stories,\u201d and he said, \u201cWe ask rooms to behave,\u201d and she nodded as if she had been doing that all her life with her face and her hands and had been waiting for a name for it.\n\nThe boy from the meeting\u2014Noah, as soon as he said it it made sense, because he had a float to him, an ark quality, something that moved even when still\u2014showed up that afternoon wearing a shirt with paint on it placed like punctuation. He stood at the edge of the stage like someone waiting to be picked last and first, and Tess, who saw everyone before they showed up, looked at him and said, \u201cYou\u2019re late if you\u2019re early, that\u2019s how this works,\u201d and handed him a broom like a knighthood. He swept with fervor, then with rhythm, then with the calm of a person who had been given a repeatable action and was not going to let it go. When he saw the chalk cups he asked, \u201cDo I draw one,\u201d and Evan said, \u201cIf you ever draw one do it slow and small and say something nice while you\u2019re doing it,\u201d and Noah said, \u201cLike what,\u201d and Vee, walking by with a pair of scissors in her back pocket as if they\u2019d grown there, said, \u201cLike \u2018I forgive you,\u2019\u201d and Noah took that word as if it were water.\n\nThat night, halfway through Act Two, the red fabric river did a new thing; it snagged on a splinter in the table no one had seen and would have torn if Marcus hadn\u2019t moved his hand like a man who has once broken something sacred and vowed never to again. The audience did not know; they only heard the intake of breath from six onstage lungs and the little \u201ctsk\u201d from Sophie in the wings, and then they saw the river run, smooth as a long apology. Evan, from the booth, watched the near-ruin and had a thought he didn\u2019t care for, that the show wanted to be something and would try with or without him, and then he had the better thought that his small interventions mattered because they made beauty possible instead of merely lucky. He pressed \u201cGo\u201d and felt his finger like a vote.\n\nAfter, when the room had emptied of its borrowed heartbeats and the lobby smelled like damp coats and gratitude, Tess sent everyone home except him and Colm, which felt like being kept after school by a teacher who wants to ask you about your mother. She went to the prop table and placed her hands flat on either side of the red freckles and closed her eyes like a person listening for a train. \u201cIt\u2019s quieter,\u201d she said after a while, and then she looked at the chalk cups and added, \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t see you dipping into the pantry without asking. If you make a mess you clean it.\u201d\n\nColm grinned with his mouth closed like a boy, and Tess rolled her eyes and said, \u201cYou two are going to give me a heart attack and then you\u2019ll add me to the lighting plot as if a ghost weren\u2019t a nuisance,\u201d and then she put her hand on Evan\u2019s head briefly, the way Magda had done without the history, the way June had done with all of it. \u201cYou\u2019re learning a new kind of flight,\u201d she said, brisk so he wouldn\u2019t get ideas, and then she was gone, the door swinging with her authority for a full minute.\n\nThe next day rain came in a uniform sheet like the town had ordered it from a catalog and was now obligated by return policy to keep it. The bridge swelled its sound to be heard over the regular shush, and the chalk at the pillar dissolved into scripts the water understood better than they did. Evan went with Colm anyway because there are rituals that call you even when they have been half-undone by weather, and they stood under the lip of concrete and listened to the sound of the river correcting itself. The red mark from two nights ago had been painted over by someone efficient, a gray bandaid on a bruise, and the new gray had already learned to be damp in a particular way. Colm did not draw anything. He stood and put his hand in his pocket and brought out nothing but lint, and he smiled at the river and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me if you\u2019re unhappy,\u201d and the river said what rivers say, which is Yes and No and Always and Never, a grammar of contradictions that nonetheless holds boats.\n\nOn Sunday June made a roast that had never met an animal, and Arthur pretended to carve it with ceremony and then passed plates like a man at a communion rail. They ate and did not talk about bridges or doors. They talked about a neighbor whose child had shaved his head for charity and about a man at the hardware store who had given June a discount as if she were a story he wanted to be in. Colm told them a tame version of an evening that had ended with him walking a drunk home and putting her on her own couch like a coat and leaving a glass of water on the piano where she\u2019d see it. Evan told them that the hat had disappeared and been found on the hat rack as if it had finally decided to follow its own instructions. They were a family for a whole hour, with repetitions and interruptions and the knowledge that the week would rip them into their separate costumes again.\n\nIn the night, because nights will, it came back and tried another room. Not the bridge, not the theater, not the church basement with its coffee-stained democracy. It came to the bus that city workers parked behind the library, a long yellow animal that dozed on its own fumes. The driver arrived before dawn for one of those routes only birds and insomniacs notice and found a smear on the glass over the emergency exit in the back, a handprint incomplete and too small, the sort of mark that makes you think of children first and then of hands that don\u2019t belong to children anymore. He called someone because he was a good man; the someone he called called someone else because that is how towns function; and the someone else who answered was Colm, because of course, and because the town had learned a number that woke him.\n\nThey went together in the gray butter of early morning, Evan and Colm, the streetlights not yet convinced there would be a day. The bus stood in its place like an animal chained to a post that only it could see. The mark looked almost pink in that light, absurdly sweet, and that made the back of Evan\u2019s teeth ache more than red ever would. He walked around the bus with a hand out the way you walk around a sleeping horse and spoke to it without words because you do that when a thing is large and could harm you without malice. Colm climbed the stairs and stood in the aisle and put his hand on a seat, and the bus accepted his touch like metal does, all or nothing.\n\n\u201cDo you hear it,\u201d Colm said, and Evan wanted to answer No on principle, but the truth was a small humiliating Yes because the idea had entered him and would not be evicted. It was not a sound, not exactly. It was a held note. It was a breath with nowhere to go. It was a plane in a holding pattern, circling, waiting for fog to lift. It was the hand he had seen on the windshield turned into intention and trapped. He looked at the emergency exit and saw how it would be to try to push it and find that there were rules about which way doors open, rules the door refused to explain.\n\nColm did not draw chalk because chalk is nothing on glass. He took the roll of tape from his pocket\u2014gaff, not painter\u2019s, because some materials carry their own gravity\u2014and tore it into a small square and then another and another, and he made a cross of tape on the emergency exit release, a child\u2019s salute to seriousness. \u201cThis is stupid,\u201d Evan said, and Colm said, \u201cYes,\u201d and then he said, \u201cSometimes stupid is a language a room understands,\u201d and then he breathed on the glass to fog it like a magician refusing to be a liar and placed his hand flat over the small hand that had been there, and Evan saw for a second the ridiculous and unbearable tenderness of a man trying to tell glass not to be cruel.\n\nThey stood there too long for men who had jobs, and then they left because theater and hardware and the day insisted. In the booth, later, Evan said \u201cStandby\u201d with a voice that was more bass than it had been a week ago, and he saw that Vee had wrapped her fingers with tape without bleeding to earn it, and he watched Noah sweep as if a broom could erase history and replace it with a very clean floor. In a lull between scenes, Tess said from the back of the house, \u201cWe will do another piece in the fall,\u201d as if announcing a weather pattern, \u201cone about places that misbehave,\u201d and everyone groaned because devising a piece is a small war, and then everyone nodded because there is nothing worse than being safe.\n\nThat night a man who had never set foot in a theater came and sat in the back and watched as if his life depended on it because maybe it did; afterward he came up the aisle and stood near the booth and raised a hand like someone asking a question in school. He said to Evan, \u201cI used to fly,\u201d and Evan had the urge to salute him without knowing from what or to what, and he said, \u201cI am temporarily grounded,\u201d and the man said, \u201cAren\u2019t we all,\u201d and then he laughed the laugh of men who have watched clouds from the wrong side and left while the lobby still felt like a lung.\n\nEvan lay in bed later and looked at the ceiling that he knew intimately, every hairline crack like a line on a map he could trace with his finger when he couldn\u2019t sleep. The house made its sounds, the small pings and groans that mean a structure is remembering what it is to be held up. He thought of chalk and tape and cup shapes and red fabric and doors with rules and bridges and buses. He thought of hands on glass and hands on levers and the way a stage breathes when the lights go out. He imagined, not fancifully but in the manner of a person making a list before a trip, a set of instructions for being a person that he could live with: drink water, stand where asked, draw small circles that mean welcome, say Hold when you have to, say Go when you must, keep your hand on the switch and do not flinch when the light comes.\n\nIn the morning the sun did its plain yellow work on the brick of the theater and the pillar of the bridge and the paintboard in the boy\u2019s hand. The town stretched and decided again to be a town. There were donuts at the firehouse and dogs nosing at grass and old men standing with hands behind their backs conducting invisible orchestras. Colm came to the kitchen with a newspaper he didn\u2019t read and a look he couldn\u2019t help and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a woman who lost a ring near the river and thinks she wants it,\u201d and June said, \u201cTell her to come get a bracelet instead; I have a tin of them,\u201d and Arthur said, \u201cHe will, and he will take her to see the bridge and not give her the ring when he finds it because it is the wrong ring,\u201d and Colm said, \u201cCorrect,\u201d and then looked at Evan like a man looking at a weather vane he had relied upon for years and asked, \u201cYou on headset,\u201d and Evan nodded and said, \u201cI am,\u201d and that was both an answer and a vow.On the seventh morning since he put his bag down in the front hall and let June call it staying, the town woke smelling like cut grass and wet newspaper, and Colm said, \u201cThe ring woman is real and she is outside your mother\u2019s house because the world is small when it wants to be.\u201d He said it while standing at the sink drinking water like a man who has been reminded how mortal a throat is. June wiped her hands on a towel and arranged her mouth into the shape that meant she would approve of anyone who asked for help if they did it without superiority. Arthur made a noise that could have been skepticism or exactly the opposite, and Evan looked out the front window because he knew his part, which was always to look first and decide second.\n\nShe was there on the walk under the maple that always made more shade than made sense, a woman in a dress that tried hard not to be new and a cardigan with those satin ribbons at the neck that you never use. Her hair was pulled back the way nurses wear it in hospitals and actors on stage when they play nurses, and her eyes were the eyes of someone who had moved between aisles for too long, the grocery, the drugstore, the church, carrying lists like they were oaths. She held her hand at her sternum like something there needed holding. When June opened the door, the woman turned that held hand into a wave and then into a brace for the other hand, which had, Evan saw, a small band of nakedness where something had been.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to come without phoning,\u201d she said, and Evan wondered if she had ever in her life done anything without apologizing first to air and to doorways. \u201cI am Elaine. I\u2014 Colm helped my neighbor with her furnace, and someone put my name on a scrap of paper that ended up in his pocket and now here we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe like scraps,\u201d June said, ushering her into the house with a softness that had saved many a ragged person from thinking they were ragged. \u201cWe keep them in boxes and pretend we\u2019ll make quilts. Sit. We\u2019ll put coffee in you and if you want to talk about a ring I will not let Arthur get righteous about how things are lost on purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am righteous about very few things,\u201d Arthur said, and then proved himself a liar by handing Elaine a cup of coffee as if he were conducting a ceremony. \u201cTell us where the river took it.\u201d\n\nElaine smiled at that, small but real. \u201cBy the little bridge where the rocks sound like they\u2019re making fun of you,\u201d she said. \u201cI was there after my shift because the sound was a way to not think. I took off my ring to put lotion on because my hands\u2014 well.\u201d She held them out and they were hands that had been dry and scrubbed and wet and scrubbed and dry, the skin like paper that\u2019s seen the rain and been ironed and seen the rain again. \u201cI put it in my pocket and then I did not put it back on, and when I got home I had lotion and no ring and I retraced steps and I used my phone like a flashlight though that is not what it is and I went back in the morning and then it rained and now I am here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDescribe it,\u201d Colm said, not impatient, just saving the room time later when the light would be different. \u201cNot the metals, the feeling.\u201d\n\nShe blinked at him and then did the tiny nod he always valued in people, the one that meant they could take a sideways question and answer it straight. \u201cIt fits,\u201d she said, and then laughed at herself for the simplicity. \u201cIt was my mother\u2019s and it fits. It isn\u2019t more precious than that and it is. It has a chip you only see when you tilt it. It did not cost anything to anyone who keeps records.\u201d\n\nJune said, \u201cI have a tin of bracelets,\u201d reflex because she couldn\u2019t help offering substitutes, and Elaine smiled like someone being handed a coat while she stands in a dress she has promised to wear because it was bought for her.\n\nThey went because that is what you do when there is a ring and a river and a woman who has made herself small to come and ask. The road at that hour was indifferent to drama. The man who sprayed for weeds was dressed like a ghost of municipal business. High school kids pretending to jog practiced a choreography of disdain and hunger. The bridge looked like it always did, which is part of why it\u2019s dangerous; you forget how many feet have crossed it wanting different things. The river whispered its long gossip.\n\nElaine stood with her hands at her sides like a child and said, \u201cI stood here,\u201d and you could see it, the spot stamped with her trying. Colm went down the bank like a man who knows how to use his ankle bones and who knows the result of not knowing. Evan followed and hated the way the damp tested the rubber edge of his shoe. He could feel his throat prepare a speech about iron and pennies and slurred sweetness and he stopped the speech with a different voice, his own low. He said, for himself, \u201cStandby,\u201d because it was ridiculous and also worked.\n\nColm didn\u2019t bring chalk because chalk is silly here. He brought a magnet on a string which was sillier and which worked, sometimes. He dropped it in the shallow and pulled up bottle caps like coins from a fairy story that doesn\u2019t pay well, then he went further down where the river made that anxious murmur at the culvert and tossed in the magnet where the current was a little greedy. \u201cIt has a chip,\u201d he said, remembering, though the magnet didn\u2019t care about chips. Evan watched the water over his foot flatten and fatten, flatten and fatten, like a breath he could pace. He could smell iron because he had brought iron odor with him in his head; the river only smelled like river.\n\n\u201cI can go in,\u201d he heard himself say, surprising himself and the part of him that would have gone anywhere but in. He took off his shoes, which made June\u2019s voice rise up in his brain with a warning about hooks and glass, and stepped into Ohio in June. The water went to his calves and then to his knees, and there was that quick ache you get and then the animal part of you adjusts and calls it fine. He moved his feet along like he was dancing with the bottom because putting them down hard would be stupid, and he put his hand in and the water looked at his hand like a cat looks at a stranger, dubious and finely attentive.\n\nHe found nothing but stone at first, nothing but the cold that has less to do with temperature and more to do with wear. He then found a thing that wasn\u2019t stone, a small oval of glass from a bottle that had been memorized by the current until it forgot it had started life as a handle for liquor. He picked it up and thought how easy it is to mistake histories that have been polished long enough. He moved a little deeper and felt a slick of algae that told him he should not move that way again, and then he felt a thing that was a circle, and his breath did the wrong thing because circles and rings and throats are cousins. He closed his hand not around it but beside it and then coaxed, as if the object were a shy friend of a friend at a party. The ring slid against his skin and attempted to go back to the river because everything tries to go back if you let it, and he said out loud, foolish, \u201cHold,\u201d and the ring rested against his fingers like a bird that pretends it chose you.\n\nWhen he came up out of the water he had a small piece of metal and a trembling he did not hate. It was not gold. It was a crooked hoop of something that had been plated and then had surrendered. It was not Elaine\u2019s. It was a ring the river had made from something else the river had eaten. He held it up and Elaine shook her head and smiled anyway.\n\n\u201cI will keep that one if you don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the day. And for the story that goes with the day. If mine is still there it is wanted where it is. If it isn\u2019t, I\u2019ll find out I can live without it.\u201d\n\nColm bent his head and looked into the water like a man reading a book he suspects is lying. He walked a little and sat on his haunches and looked weirdly priestly doing it. He didn\u2019t draw anything, not even with a stick, which made Evan feel better because drawing cups on river rock would have made him want to leave. He put his hand on a stone and then lifted his palm and there was a line of red under his skin that hadn\u2019t been there before, the sort of line that might alarm someone who hadn\u2019t been living inside metaphor for a week. Evan flinched and then did not, because the line was under, not on. He made his breath change shape. He looked at Elaine\u2019s hands, at the way they had learned to be steady from being demanded of, and he thought of the fake blood in the tub and the way it had accepted a finger and been silly. He thought of the nosebleed and of pressing a compress with the back of his hand so he didn\u2019t have to look straight at the thing his brain had decided to name. He thought of the math of small kindnesses and saw how it totaled larger than most catastrophes.\n\nOn the way back to the house Elaine sat in the back seat and spoke to the ring that was not hers like people speak to a plant they have stuck in the sun to see if it wants to live. She said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be a story,\u201d and the ring did not argue because it had no mouth. At the corner a boy on a skateboard did a shape with his board that looked like grammar failing and then recovering, and Evan laughed without thinking, which is always the better kind of laugh.\n\nAt the theater Tess handed him a new set of responsibilities as if she had ordered them from a catalog and they had arrived in a box slightly crushed. \u201cWe have a matinee for a school that believes it is doing a good thing for their children which is how they make sure the parents keep paying them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be loud in the ways quiet people do loudness. The questions afterward will be awful and revealing. You will announce \u2018Please turn off your devices\u2019 and be listened to by none. Also, our dimmers have a cough; if they do that cough during the red fabric sequence, you will lie to them and say we mean it. You will be very convincing.\u201d\n\nHe went into the booth and sat for a minute without touching anything because he had learned you can\u2019t put your hands on every tool you love every hour; you have to let them be furniture half the day. The school filed in like a creature with many sneakers. The teacher voices made layers, sweet and authoritarian, and the building adjusted itself to hold their amount of expectation. He said, into a mic that made everyone sound like a radio they trusted, \u201cPlease turn off anything that will ring,\u201d and half a dozen children put phones deeper into pockets like burying mice. Vee came up the stairs with a paper cup and set it by his right hand without looking at him because sometimes that is how kindness behaves. \u201cSip,\u201d she said, and then, \u201cIf they ask you anything in the Q&A don\u2019t tell them there\u2019s fake blood in a tub because then we will have to mop questions instead of floors.\u201d\n\nHe did the show and it came like it should, with a bump at the place where the projector had been sulking, and he pushed past it with his thumb like a man refusing to listen to a sulking friend. The children made a noise he liked when the red fabric moved, the combination of \u201cOh,\u201d and \u201cI could do that,\u201d and \u201cIt had not occurred to me to desire this until this second,\u201d which was essentially the reason to open any door. After, when the lights came to half and the children were given permission to make theater about themselves, a boy raised his hand and did not wait to be called on and asked, \u201cIs it scary when it\u2019s dark in here and you are the only one who knows where the lights are,\u201d and Evan said into the mic, \u201cOnly in the way being in charge of a light switch is scary,\u201d and the children laughed and then a girl in the back raised her hand very formally and asked, \u201cWhat do you do if you make a mistake,\u201d and he wanted to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d but his mouth, which was learning to be honest in public, said, \u201cYou forgive yourself quickly so you can stop making it,\u201d and the kids made that humming sound children make when they are deciding whether to let a sentence into their private arsenal.\n\nHis phone buzzed as the kids left, and he thought, Max, because Max had a knack for buzzing him when he was between tasks, but it was Fischer, the beard man who liked maps and had a picture of a Cessna like a diploma in his office. He stepped into the hallway where the emergency light made everyone look like a rehearsal version of themselves. \u201cHow\u2019s your leave, Marlowe,\u201d Fischer said, which could be anything from \u201cAre you stealing the pens,\u201d to \u201cAre you dying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a list,\u201d Evan said, because that was as accurate as anything. \u201cI have a job where I say \u2018Standby\u2019 and \u2018Go\u2019 and \u2018Hold\u2019 but no one dies if I say them wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recommend it to everyone,\u201d Fischer said, and his tone made you suspect he meant it. \u201cI\u2019m checking because we have to check, and because I put your name on a thing that says you talk to Dr. Leary on Tuesday, and it\u2019s not optional if you want your seat back, and I thought, be kind, tell him before a machine does.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d Evan said, and he swallowed the little noise his throat had been saving for doctors. \u201cI\u2019m working on a muscle.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cYou can build a lot of muscle in one place and discover it helps somewhere else. Someone told me that once, I don\u2019t remember who, probably my wife. If you need more leave you take it; if you want to sit on a jumpseat with old men and talk about whether landing on one engine in Cincinnati is classy or stupid, you call me. We\u2019ll be here when you decide you can look at the glass without choking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Evan said, and this time he meant it without any little darts of irony at the word. He put the phone back in his pocket and felt like someone on the bridge in the first days of spring: the river still cold and mean and hungry, but the light moving differently across it and a person upstream thinking of taking their shoes off.\n\nThat afternoon he found himself on the floor in the wing, holding a staple gun and a piece of muslin and swearing under his breath because he had put the staple where no staple should be. Sophie leaned over him with a look that was ninety percent pity and ten percent the joyful superiority of a woman with a toolkit. \u201cYour thumb is going to get you,\u201d she said, and a beat later it did, the staple skidding and the skin betraying him with the smallest slick. He saw it, he felt the small sting, he opened his mouth for the old air, and then he closed his mouth and decided to let the sting be loud and the sight be small. He pinched with his other hand and breathed out with a noise like someone pressing a banjo string for pitch. Vee appeared out of somewhere with the little box of silly Band-Aids they kept for exactly this, the ones with cartoon clouds and the ones with a line for your name which amused Tess every time. \u201cI am not falling,\" he said, and Vee, without making a face that would make him hate her, said, \u201cI know,\u201d and put the cloud on his thumb as if she were doing a magic trick for a child she decided to like.\n\nNoah swept like a person who had found a religion, and when he slumped on the stage with his broom lying across his shins like an instrument he would refuse to learn, Evan sat next to him and passed him a bottle of water like it was contraband. \u201cYou could teach sweeping,\u201d he said, and Noah said, \u201cYou could teach talking into a microphone,\u201d and Evan said, \u201cI could teach saying \u2018Hold\u2019 to a room until the room does it,\u201d and Noah said, \u201cI need that,\u201d and took a drink like he had understood the metaphor and made it literal to be safe.\n\nThey talked about paint and doors and the boy said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could ask a room to behave,\u201d and Evan said, \u201cMost rooms like to be asked,\u201d and Noah nodded with that hungry face boys have when someone offers them an adult sentence with their name on it. When Noah went to the lobby to carry two heavy things that had been designed to look light, Evan looked at the chalk cups he had drawn and saw they had smudged into little moons, and he did not redraw them because there\u2019s a time to redraw and a time to let a line go back into the air.\n\nThere were storms in the forecast and the sky made a half-hearted drama of it all afternoon, a darkening that never committed, a rumbling that made the high windows in the booth twitch two millimeters every twenty minutes. Evan took this weather like a quiz he had not studied for, kept his paper blank for a while, then wrote his name on it, then decided to stay. When the rain finally came, it came as if scolded into doing its job, an efficient discipline. The building liked rain; it had learned to be hugged by it. The light board arcs sounded different when the dust above them found water; the air took the ghost of a smell like someone had ironed a thousand shirts in the next room and the doors were left open on purpose. He pressed \u201cGo\u201d with dry fingers and considered the nights he had pressed \u201cGo\u201d with sweating ones and the way humans mistake that for courage.\n\nWhen he got home, June had left a Tupperware marked with masking tape that said \u201cRoast you can live with,\u201d and a note that said, \u201cWent to book club, do not let them make me read anything where all the women are mean to each other.\u201d Arthur had underlined an article in the paper about the city council and left the page for Colm on the table with a highlighter as if he were training a parrot to speak. Colm came in late with a smell like rain on wool and sat without turning on the light. In the dark, with only the street\u2019s offering making the edges of the room visible, he said, \u201cThe boy has good hands for doors,\u201d as if announcing a grade on a report card. Evan said, \u201cHe wants to not make trouble,\u201d and Colm said, \u201cNobody wants to make trouble. They want to be listened to without qualifying the listening. That is different,\u201d and Evan did not disagree.\n\n\u201cDid you find the ring,\u201d Colm asked after a minute, and Evan said, \u201cI found a ring,\u201d and that was sufficient because sometimes a ring is an answer and sometimes it is a place for a better question to sit. They sat with that for a while without messing it up by talking around it. The house made a shift sound like a person turning over in sleep on the other side of a wall. Evan ate a piece of roast standing up because no religion should be pure. He poured water and looked at the glass and tried to see if it wanted to be cruel; it looked like what it was, a thing that holds and is held.\n\nOn Monday the theater was a shopping list. Tess put assignments on the whiteboard that had been cleaned so much it had its own sky. \u201cPostcards at the coffee places,\u201d she wrote, then added, \u201cbut only where they like us,\u201d and \u201cfix the squeaky hinge on the second row because it\u2019s starting to think it\u2019s in the show,\u201d and \u201cteach Noah to run house lights by Friday or else,\u201d with three exclamation points she would later deny. Evan went out with Vee to tape a flyer to a bulletin board that did not believe in tapes and watched as she argued with the cork until it admitted her pushpin. In the window of the haberdashery pretending to be necessary, a mannequin with no head wore a tie like a wound. Vee said, \u201cMy father used to wear those ties and have opinions about the shoes of men on television,\u201d which was a bigger sentence than she usually let out in daylight, and he said, \u201cMy father used to forget I could see him,\u201d which landed between them with a polite clink, like utensils on a placemat.\n\n\u201cDo you go to see him,\u201d she said after they had both decided they would not comment on what they had said, and he said, \u201cI go to the place he works because it\u2019s in my town and because his sorry shape is part of the skyline. He shapes wood with insistence and I have to respect that. He told me boys don\u2019t faint. He was wrong in a category larger than fainting. He had a cut once, on his hand, and he slapped me when I fell down, and I keep walking past that in my head like it\u2019s a picture in a hall I don\u2019t have time to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoors you don\u2019t want to open are still doors,\u201d Vee said, not gently and not unkind, and he felt a little angry because she was not in his family and how dare she be right, and then he realized he was not angry at her at all but at the sentence for being clever and true at the same time.\n\nThat afternoon, in a little pocket of nothing between acts and rain, a woman stood in the lobby holding her purse the way people hold Bibles when they aren\u2019t sure they believe. She had a face that had been careful for many years and had lately quit. She said to Evan, \u201cMy kid was the one who asked you about mistakes,\u201d and he said, \u201cYour kid is good at questions.\u201d She said, \u201cHe told me you said you forgive yourself quickly so you can stop making it. He said it while he was trying to fix the faucet I have been yelling at for two months and it made me want to lie down on the floor and cry like one of those women in movies who always end up married again by the end. Do you really do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I forgive and sometimes I perform forgiving and hope the rest catches up,\u201d he said, which was more exposure than a lobby requires. \u201cSometimes I make the same mistakes because I like them. Sometimes I make new ones and praise myself for the variety.\u201d\n\nShe laughed in that dangerous way where the next sound could be anything and said, \u201cYou\u2019re very unhelpful in the way that makes me feel less alone,\u201d and then she bought two tickets and left with a walk like someone who had remembered she is funny.\n\nThat night the town had a sound like cutlery being put away after a party that had not been a success. The red mark came back in dreams in a smaller size, on the glass of a bus and on the back door of the theater and on the countertop where June had left a note about milk. He woke and went to the kitchen and drank water and pressed his thumb to the little cloud Band-Aid until its adhesive reminded him of childish loyalty. He thought of tomorrow and the man with the beard and the office with the airplane picture and the particular kind of reporting he would have to do about himself. He had feared storms and learned to fly in them. Now he had learned to light a room so that storms could be theater. He would sit in a chair and say a word like \u201cpanic\u201d and wait for the person across from him to nod like a priest who has seen stranger sins. He would say \u201cbird\u201d as if it were both an apology and a punchline. He would say \u201cblood\u201d on purpose in a sentence and feel the way the air handles the word differently depending on who had invited it, doctor or actor or man in a kitchen at night with his hand on a glass.\n\nTuesday was blue and efficient. The office where Dr. Leary worked refused to be anything other than a room, which somehow helped. There were magazines older than most of the people who would read them. The receptionist had hair in a clip that reminded him of a rib. When he sat with the man whose job it was to make pilots tell the truth, he thought of checklists and found himself relieved. \u201cWhat brings you here,\u201d the man said in that voice that is taught in the rooms where therapists renew their licenses, and Evan said, \u201cBirds do not bring me here, but they are the excuse, and blood is not a storm but my body thought otherwise,\u201d and the man said, \u201cGood,\u201d as if he adhered to the church of naming things. They talked about cockpit doors and door doors and about the smell of iron that may or may not exist, and the man did not tell him he was ridiculous and did not tell him he was brave and told him instead, \u201cWhat your amygdala is doing makes sense; it lacks context; we give it context; you go back when your body quits tripping the alarm at the wrong party.\u201d\n\nHe left the office feeling like he had been given homework he did not hate. He drove past the airport and did not go in because he did not want to test any spells, and because he wanted to keep the runway a promise and not a dare. He went to the theater, which had become, for all its cobbled charms and its leaks and its smell of ten years of caffeine, a sanctuary. Tess looked at him and did not ask. She handed him a roll of tape and said, \u201cThe broom closet is rebellious; domesticate it,\u201d and he did, arranging mops like soldiers, a satisfaction so clean it made him want to change his name.\n\nAfter the show that night they did notes with Tess doing her best impression of a mean person because everyone had done well and praise makes them lazy. \u201cSophie,\u201d she said, \u201cyour shirt is noisier than your scene; don\u2019t let cloth upstage your grief,\u201d and \u201cMarcus, the hat is not a character, put it when you put it and stop letting it flirt with the audience,\u201d and \u201cVee, you are one sigh too many; keep one for later; trust me; you can always sell your sighs at the market,\u201d and \u201cEvan, your \u2018Standby\u2019 is perfect but you are touching the faders with your middle finger like a man in a French film; use your whole hand so they know you\u2019re married to the job.\u201d He nodded like a student and made his fingers obey and felt the small rush of having changed a habit problem-side down.\n\nWhen they were almost out the door Noah came running in through the alley with a look on his face that made Evan want to block a doorway and make the room smaller and safer by the square foot. \u201cThere\u2019s a\u2014\u201d Noah said, and then did not say it because he had learned about not letting nouns win. He made instead a shape with his hands like two things that had loved each other and then been separated. \u201cAt the bridge,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone put something in the cup and now the cup is \u2014 I don\u2019t have the word.\u201d\n\nThey went with their coats half on. The alley had the trash smell of a city that is too polite to admit it is a city. The bridge had the look of a patient being visited by too many people who claim to be relatives. The chalk cups, or what remained, had collected rain and dust and small kindnesses, and someone, because humans cannot resist a vessel, had put a pebble in one, and someone else had put a broken bottle cap in another, and someone, because youth is exuberant, had put a cigarette butt in the last. The pebbled one was fine, the cap one was a joke that didn\u2019t hurt, and the cigarette had burned the chalk edge into a black scar like an eyelash too long and too close to the flame. Colm stood and looked at the small damage like a man who has to admit he forgot to put something out of reach. Evan crouched without wanting to and put his hand near the burn because the smell of it had the same joke as fake blood, it suggested one thing and was another, and he could take that right now.\n\nNoah rocked on his heels like a child pretending not to need to pee. \u201cDid I ruin it,\u201d he said softly, and Evan understood the grammar of that question, the I means all of us, the it means the thing we made and the thing making us. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, because in this case no was true. \u201cWe are practicing. We will forget where the chalk is and we will leave the tape in the wrong drawer and we will invite something in with our big red hands and then we will put cups in the right place and ask for the right kind of quiet.\u201d\n\nColm wiped the ash with his sleeve and made a face because he adored his sleeve. He took out a rag like a conjurer not because he had hidden one but because he had prepared one and was now pleased by his own competence. He wiped until the black was a memory. He drew the cup again, smaller, in a place where a shoe would have to be rude to hit it. He said, very quietly and only once, \u201cStay,\u201d and Evan watched his brother\u2019s breath and saw how it matched the water and learned another thing about what he was really doing here.\n\nOn the seventh night since they began calling it a run, the audience contained a man with a scar through his eyebrow and a woman with a scarf that had traveled more than she had. June sat in the front row and held her hands in her lap the way she would if she were on a bus with a baby nobody knew where to look at. Arthur took notes in the dark with a pen that glowed, which made him look like he had been given a position by a deity. Colm stood for a long time and then sat when someone else wanted that space more. Evan pressed \u201cGo\u201d and he meant it. He said \u201cStandby\u201d and the word did not sound like a lie. He put the river and the ring and the chalk and the boy and the bus and the nose and the glass and the bridge in a place in his chest that was not a closet and not a trash bin; it was a shelf. He felt the shelf hold. He felt the shelf shudder and then settle. He put his hand on the fader and let his whole palm touch it like vows are supposed to be touched, with all available surface. The red moved like a language. The stage breathed like a thing that loves you when you do not deserve it and which will be there when you do.\n\nAfter, he stood in the door on the side of the stage where the actors go out to smoke and make pronouncements and said to Noah, \u201cYou draw the cups tomorrow, if they need them,\u201d and Noah said, \u201cI will,\u201d and then, as if offering information about the weather, \u201cI told my mother I made a door by accident and she said she had made three on purpose and we laughed,\u201d and Evan thought that maybe, if there were an after, this would be what earned them it.\n\nLater, in bed, with the window open just enough to argue with June\u2019s preferences, he dreamed, not of the cockpit or the stage, but of a room that had been both and neither, a room with bolts and light and the smell of warmed dust, a room where there was a switch and the switch had a label and the label was his name. He pressed it, in the dream, and nothing terrible happened and the room did what rooms do when you ask them with your whole hand. He woke to a morning that did not mind being itself and made coffee and went downstairs and said \u201cGood morning\u201d to the house the way he sometimes said \u201cHold\u201d when no one was listening and meant it.He woke with the particular clarity that sometimes visits you after a week of being someone else and being yourself at the same time, a thin bright line down the inside of the day that made him think he could thread a needle without looking. June had left a bowl of apples on the table and the newspaper folded to the page Arthur would want to scold, and the light came in over the sink with that late-morning leniency that forgives any number of late nights. He poured coffee and let it be coffee without auditioning it for metaphor, because there are days when even men who like to name things permit nouns to be just nouns. When he looked up, Colm was already there in a chair like he had grown from it overnight, the warmth around him banked and thrifty, his hands around a mug as if he were cooperating with a ritual and not leading it. \u201cToday is a day for errands,\u201d Colm said, as if he had checked with the calendar personally, and June, who never believed in light work, said, \u201cErrands are what life is made of,\u201d and handed him a list with her handwriting marching, as if it had been trained in a tiny army where persuasion outranked force.\n\nOn the way to the Evergreen he detoured on purpose by the turnoff to the airport, the lanes blued with paint in numbers that will outlive the people who painted them. He did not pull in, because there is a difference between flirting and making trouble, but he let himself look at the sign until the shape of the word felt like a thing he could put in his mouth again without choking. Max texted him a picture of a weather radar with a little circle around a chunk like a bruise and a caption that said, \u201cShe\u2019s ugly and leaving for Pittsburgh,\u201d which was Max\u2019s way of showing affection. He sent back a picture of the light board with faders standing like wheat and wrote, \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful and doesn\u2019t move without me,\u201d and Max answered with fifteen thumbs-up that made him weirdly grateful for the stupid language of icons.\n\nTess met him at the door with a map of the day, which was her face. \u201cWe have a kindergarten at ten,\u201d she said, moving a roll of tape from wrist to wrist like a bangle with obligations, \u201cand they will ask better questions than the high schoolers and wipe their noses on our seating if we are not quick with the tissues. Then tech notes because we have gotten cocky and the lights got out of their lanes last night and I will not be made a liar by electricity. Then the mayor\u2019s assistant would like to pretend we are a symbol and take a photo in which she will stand too close to a ladder and I will move her gently with my eyes. Also, someone put a handprint near the box office that is not in our paint palette. Bring your patience.\u201d\n\nThe handprint was small and sincere in the wrong red, at the corner where people brush without noticing because bodies do that in buildings. It was not a horror film of a thing; it looked like a child had pressed curiosity to the wall, an experiment in, What will happen if I give away this much of my shape. He felt his stomach somehow step aside and make room for it, and the relief that came with that made his eyes prick, which annoyed him in the exact way relief will when it shows up in rooms you didn\u2019t invite it to. \u201cI have vinegar,\u201d Vee said, already there, already wielding a rag with the authority of someone who had done this ritual on three continents in rooms with worse attitude. \u201cI will charm it; you will not watch; Sophie will mutter about paint wearing thin and then fix it with a recipe she learned from a grandmother who taught her to knit and fight in the same hour.\u201d He let them work, because masculinity had lain down in him for the morning and decided to nap, and because his function right then was to rehearse saying \u201cHold\u201d to a room full of five-year-olds who would ignore him with more grace than most adults.\n\nKindergarten audiences are a religion if you let them be, and Tess had long ago become their liturgy. He said, \u201cHalf hour,\u201d and got back a hundred versions of \u201cWhat Is Half of Anything,\u201d and then he said, \u201cFive,\u201d and watched a child near the aisle hold up a hand and count his fingers to make sense of being told to count at all. They watched the show with the kind of reverence children have for anything that looks like it requires adult permission, and then they made a sound at the red fabric that was neither gasp nor laugh but that little \u201coh\u201d cats make when you open a new can. One boy asked if the fabric was a snake and if the snake would bite the bad guys, and Vee, who had unfolded herself into teacher for the duration, said, \u201cThere are no bad guys, only people who forgot what room they were supposed to be in,\u201d and the boy looked satisfied, like the world had been returned to him in a condition he could hold.\n\nAfter, a pale girl with hair like thread asked Evan into the mic, \u201cAre you afraid when it is dark and your mom is not there,\u201d and he said his mouth\u2019s truth before his defenses could reassemble: \u201cI am afraid and then I am not,\u201d which turned out to be the exact dose she required. He gave her a flashlight and her teacher looked like she was going to cry and then didn\u2019t, because you can tell a teacher by the way she treats her tears as capital to be spent wisely. Vee cleaned the handprint with vinegar and laughter and left a faint pink memory that couldn\u2019t harm a soul, and Sophie blended paint while humming something you would not believe she knew, and for an hour the whole building behaved.\n\nAt noon Tess sent them to the coffee shop with a stack of postcards and the instruction to flirt with restraint, which Vee interpreted as a mandate to stare down a barista\u2019s moustache until it agreed to put the cards in front instead of under the tip jar. The mayor\u2019s assistant arrived as threatened in heels that were a joke on the idea of pavement and stood with Tess near the ladder for a photo that would be captioned with words about Community and Art and Partnership, none of which would include the price of gaff. \u201cWe love small businesses,\u201d the assistant said, and Tess said, \u201cWe are smaller than you can be without falling through the grates,\u201d and someone in the assistant\u2019s brain wrote it down and labeled it folksy so it could be pulled out later at fundraisers to charm a crowd that pretended it couldn\u2019t be charmed.\n\nThe power decided to be a character at two, in the middle of a cue-to-cue that Tess had insisted on because she liked to iron the same clothes three times if anyone was going to stare at them. There was a blip and a sound like an old radio pretending to die theatrically, and then the rich dark that has weight came up from the floor and sat in everyone\u2019s lap. Someone said \u201cShit,\u201d and someone said \u201cSorry,\u201d and someone else tried to fix both with humor, which was the local currency. Evan\u2019s body tried on an old habit, the one where dark is bad because dark is a prelude to alarms and glass and the smell of wrong; then his body remembered his other job, the one where dark is a garment they put on and take off with style. \u201cHold,\u201d he said, not loud but full, and the room obeyed because it needed someone to tell it what to do with its new silence. He said, \u201cHouse to half when she comes back and worklights on battery,\u201d to no one in particular and to his hands, and Vee, who had a flashlight on her keychain because she is the sort of person who expects to be asked to fix things in rooms she doesn\u2019t even like, snapped a beam down the aisle and made the darkness decide to be a hallway and not a swamp.\n\nThe audience of no audience behaved, sitting where they were as if they had paid for the right not to make a sound. The lights made their slow-tortoise return: the emergency strips first, then the green exit signs that suggest salvation and bureaucracy at once, and finally, grudgingly, the ghost light on its pole, which Evan loved in the way that children love talismans. He set up the board to come back online with the gentle hand a person uses on a friend who is pretending to be more fragile than it is, and when the dimmers coughed the cough Tess had predicted he coughed back, because petty machinery sometimes responds to mockery. \u201cWe will do that again,\u201d Tess said to the universe after the room consented to be a stage, and the universe said, in its way, You will or I will.\n\nThe tub of stage blood is an object that will teach humility if you are arrogant and slapstick if you are not, and that afternoon it decided to make its case by leaping off a table as if bored. Marcus had moved too quickly, blessing of his character, and the lid had not snapped, and the tub did what tubs do when you leave them with no supervision\u2014it took the floor for a brief red sermon. Someone made a sound with their mouth like an old car\u2019s brakes and Vee started to swear in a language that did not exist and Evan\u2019s eyes did their old trick, trying to pull the world in to one small spot, then his fingers saved him by putting gloves on before his head could be brave or cowardly. He knelt, and the ridiculous smell got there before the image, thank god\u2014chocolate and corn syrup and the shame of convenience. He scooped and wiped and made the movement more important than the color and said out loud, like he was teaching his own hand a song, \u201cIt\u2019s candy,\u201d and felt the sweet destroy the iron in his head. Tess underlined the moment with a quip\u2014\u201cI told you I don\u2019t believe in realism\u201d\u2014and Sophie brought a mop with the solemnity of a nurse, and slowly the floor was a floor again and not a metaphor audition.\n\nIn the late afternoon, when the time for catastrophes had expired for most normal buildings, Colm came in looking like a man who had made progress on a list and still had items that would eat him if he looked away too long. He had a smudge of something on the knuckle of his right hand that wasn\u2019t dirt and wasn\u2019t oil; if you asked, he would say it was from a lock that had decided to be poetic for an hour. He watched Evan from the back of house for a few minutes, in his way of measuring whether a person\u2019s work had grown teeth or grown shy, then crooked a finger like a magician who has finally learned to ask before he pulls a coin from behind your ear. \u201cThere\u2019s a place,\u201d he said, because that was always how it began, \u201cthat used to be a bowling alley and is pretending now to be storage for a future that never arrived. Someone with spray cans and grief has been practicing there. Before it graduates to bridges again, we might ask it to study in private.\u201d\n\nThe building was not far, because nothing in the town was ever far enough to be safe. It had been a place where people let balls go and waited for the world to make sense in ten neat explosions, a place of beer and shoes with other people\u2019s ghosts in them, and now it held folded tables and optimism in boxes. The back door was the kind the town favored, metal with a rumor of rust and a bar like an instruction to the hand. Inside, light came through slats and dust in stripes, which would have made artists happy if artists hadn\u2019t already found themselves something to be happier about. The lanes were there under a patchwork of carpet and plywood like old bones under a new skin, and the pins were gone except one, standing in the corner like a witness who knew it would not be called.\n\nOn the far wall someone had been practicing a language he or she did not speak. The red on concrete, in hand and palm and stroke and slither, was the work of someone who liked the feel of it, which is sixty percent of how trouble happens. Colm stood like a man at a museum, patient, letting the painting notice him before he noticed it in any useful way. Evan measured his breath against the room, felt the old crunchy lift of his chest and then the smarter slow. He carried in with him the theater\u2019s softness\u2014the way a person can move light like water and have it be consequence rather than command\u2014and he set up the small work lights they had stuffed in the back of the car, clamping them to a beam the way you clamp feelings to the usable part of your day.\n\nThe light changed the red immediately, because light is rude and has no loyalty to anyone\u2019s intention. The handprints that had tried to be solemn became affectionate, the streaks that wanted to be wounds cooled to something closer to crayon. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a room,\u201d Colm said, as if they were putting together the shelving unit of a god. \u201cThen we\u2019ll ask the room to remember itself.\u201d He took out chalk, the cheap kind that does not pretend to be indelible, and Evan had the ridiculous thought that he should apply for reimbursement.\n\nThey drew the cups, not making prisons but making invitations, small, low, at the base of the shapes where the red wanted to drip if it were liquid, which it wasn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t draw over hands; they drew near them, a politeness learned from cleaning up after children and elderly men who still insist on cutting their own bagels. Noah arrived because he had been everywhere all day, vibrating at the edges and sending his willingness ahead of him like a dog that wants to be liked. He looked at the wall and then at Evan and then at the chalk with a face that had learned very quickly where not to put itself. \u201cDo I,\u201d he asked, and Evan said, \u201cYes, and say something nice,\u201d and Noah, who had run out of profound two days ago and now had to let honest carry him, said, \u201cThank you for showing me what not to do,\u201d and the lines settled.\n\nThey did not perform ritual because ritual is a trap when you don\u2019t know the language. They did small things that had, if you were a certain kind of person, the shape of ritual at the edges. Colm breathed so that his breath matched the room, which is what he does when he is being the kind of ridiculous no one can teach, and Evan adjusted a light and felt his body do that clean, mechanical joy it does when a thing is correct before intention can put a signature on it. He realized the old ache in him had a rule he could exploit: if he could make his hands the most important part of what he was doing, his eyes would agree to be junior partners. \u201cStay,\u201d Colm said to the wall and to whatever wanted to pull tricks on the edges of it, and then, after a beat in which no one was inconvenienced, he said, \u201cGo,\u201d very gently, like telling water it may return to being itself.\n\nAfter, they walked around the building like nurses, checking windows and corners and the place where a back stair makes a decision about whether it is a place for secrets. A woman with keys came and thanked them with a thank-you card she had written before anyone made her grateful, the kind of faith that will always charm Colm and make him try not to say so out loud. She told them about the bowling league that had written its names on a napkin and lost them and then made do with calling each other \u201cyou,\u201d and she laughed the small laugh of someone who doesn\u2019t get to tell her stories in rooms where people are listening. He let her talk long enough for the room to register something besides red and chalk, and then they left, because if you stay too long after you close a door you start to doubt hinges.\n\nEvan saw it then for the first time, the way the warmth around Colm dimmed and brightened like something with a battery. It would be funny if it weren\u2019t so much like the cost of all things we love when we use them too hard. He said nothing, because love is occasionally smart, but the noticing changed him a degree or two, which is how loyalties grow up and become obligations you can keep happily. Back at the house June was making a cake that didn\u2019t believe in sugar and insisted on being loved anyway, and Arthur was reading the paper out loud to someone not present, perhaps his younger self, and when Colm sat down he did it like a man who\u2019d taken a long vow and brought it to completion for the day. \u201cYou look thinner around the edges,\u201d Arthur said, which might have been a joke or might have been a mercy. Colm smiled with half of his face and stole a piece of the cake that had been set aside specifically so he could steal it, because this was a house that understood the theater of justice.\n\nA letter came with the evening\u2019s mail in a windowed envelope that would have been funny at any other time, and Evan took it outside and opened it on the porch because some sentences prefer weather. Fischer\u2019s office and the company\u2019s logo made a marriage up top as unromantic as any document, and the words under them were ordinary and devastating in a gentle way. They had put him on a simulator schedule eight days hence, on a morning when the sky would probably do its very best to mind itself, and they used words like \u201cevaluation\u201d and \u201creadiness\u201d and \u201csupport\u201d that were either genuine or learned, which, in the end, feels the same if you\u2019re the one trying to breathe. He stood with the paper and thought of the light board, of the way your thumb finds the switch without consulting you, the way your body sometimes makes decisions your mind can later claim as its own if it wants the credit. He thought of saying \u201cHold\u201d into a headset and how nice it had been when a room listened. He thought of saying \u201cHold\u201d to his own blood and having it proceed with its business anyway.\n\nHe told Tess because you tell the person you work with that something will change the way your mouth says \u201cGo,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood,\u201d with a plainness he valued. She did not congratulate him as if he\u2019d won a thing; she put him into a list in which his absence would matter and did not act like that meant the list would end. \u201cI will make Noah sit in your chair when you are gone,\u201d she said, and Noah, in the doorway like a cat you forgot letting in, said, \u201cI will sit, I will sit,\u201d and then immediately assumed the posture of a person panicking quietly at being given a lever. Vee said nothing for a whole minute, and then she said, \u201cIf you leave, I get to use your pen and ruin the nib,\u201d which was her way of admitting to feelings that would otherwise make her eyes too wet.\n\nHe told June because a mother is a form of air you have to keep honest, and she said, \u201cThey will be lucky to have your nerves again,\u201d which would have sounded perverse if anyone else had said it. Arthur pointed at the envelope with a fork and said, \u201cComing and going is the work of men and trains; do it without drama and you will have done well,\u201d which made June smack his wrist with a towel and say, \u201cHe is allowed drama at least until next Thursday,\u201d and Arthur suffered the smacking like a man who has been punished better for worse.\n\nThe day before he was to go, the bus driver from the dawn and the glass came into the theater, hat in hand because that is how some men come into rooms with curtains. He watched from the back for a while, the way people do when they\u2019re deciding whether a thing is a mirror or a window, and when Evan said \u201cStandby,\u201d the man\u2019s shoulders made a shape, comprehension of ritual, recognition of power used for good. After the show he stood near the booth and said, \u201cThe tape stayed,\u201d and Evan said, \u201cGood,\u201d which was both reply and sacrament. The man said, \u201cI put my hand where the small hand had been, and for a minute I thought I was in church,\u201d and then he left because he had a route and because some people will always speak one sentence longer than they think they are allowed and then go before anyone can be rude to the overage.\n\nOn the last night before the sim, Tess made them do notes after the house had gone home, even though everything had been fine enough to leave alone. \u201cI do this so you don\u2019t forget the world is bigger than the size of your accomplishments,\u201d she said, which made Marcus groan theatrically and Sophie grin because authority wrapped in kindness is her favorite candy. She told Vee to pick a different shirt for the scene where she held the scissors because the current one insisted on finding light that didn\u2019t want it. She told Noah to stop trying not to move the brush when he swept, because trying not to is a movement too and makes twice the work. She told Evan his voice on the mic had found a register people trust, and then she added, \u201cDon\u2019t keep it when you don\u2019t need to, your friends will make fun of you for sounding like a god in a kitchen,\u201d which made him promise not to order toast like a tyrant.\n\nHe didn\u2019t sleep as badly as he\u2019d planned. Fear does not always behave and sometimes chooses to be boring, which is a relief disguised as an insult. He woke with his lungs in his chest instead of near the door and made coffee and let June put a banana in his bag because potassium is a religion if she\u2019s in the room. Colm drove him to the airport because he cannot not be the person who carries men to doors and waits near the hinge. They said almost nothing on the way, because men who like words know when to leave them in the house and let the day do the talking. At the curb, where men hug like they are making a trade in a marketplace where everything is a little too expensive, Colm squeezed his shoulder and said, \u201cWhichever room you are in, you do not owe it blood,\u201d which was more than a blessing and less than a curse, and then he let go because letting go is the only trick worth perfecting.\n\nThe simulator building is the opposite of theater in that it refuses to be romantic, which is its own kind of mercy. Fluorescent light is honest even when it is cruel, and the chairs have been sat on by men at their smallest and men at their bravest and do not care. Dr. Leary had sent him a link with breathing in four-square and a suggestion that he consider the bright idea of not losing six pounds of water through fear in an hour, and he took the suggestion and breathed as if someone had asked nicely and not because he wanted to impress anyone. The sim itself, the cockpit on stilts with a brain, was so close to familiar his fingers tried to skip the part where they asked permission, and he made them behave like guests at a good party.\n\nThe instructor had white eyebrows that made him look kind even when he was not sure he was being, and he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go where you take us,\u201d which is an outrageous sentence in that room, and then he gave Evan the weather of his own week: clear enough but daring you to lie. He ran the checklist and let the list run him, which is how you do anything good. When it was time to lift, he lifted. When it was time to pretend to land because men in rooms with expensive machines love to be generous by inventing disaster, he pretended to land in a wind that had decided to tell jokes. When it was time to lose an engine and decide that one becomes two by a sort of math you can\u2019t teach children, he found that old place that isn\u2019t bravery, exactly, but the reliable result of training that has gone into your bones.\n\nThey did not spill fake coffee. They did not make the fake headlines. They did not look at a bird pretending to be a plane and have to renegotiate centuries. He saw red differently once, not from the window, but from the panel\u2019s little lights, when an indicator for a thing that wasn\u2019t a thing blipped and he felt his old alarm ring like a neighbor at a door they should not have a key to. He said \u201cHold,\u201d under his breath, because he can\u2019t stop being a small liturgy now, and then he said, \u201cGo,\u201d and the fake plane did as asked. When they were done, his shirt clung in a way that would embarrass you if you were seventeen and vain, and the eyebrow man said, without flourish, \u201cYou\u2019ll live,\u201d which might have been the highest praise any sacred room could give.\n\nThe lobby on the way out had a pot plant pretending to thrive and a bulletin board with notices for seminars no one would attend unless their licenses depended on them. He sat for a minute on a bench and let his body catch up with itself, then texted Tess a single word\u2014\u201cGo\u201d\u2014which she would read into whatever she had at hand. He texted Colm a picture of his shoes on industrial carpet and wrote, \u201cI am where the room asks,\u201d and Colm replied with a picture of chalk dust on his fingertips and wrote, \u201cSo am I.\u201d He drove back to town with the odd feeling a person has when he has done the thing he feared he could not do and now must decide what to do with the part of him that was keeping fear as a pet.\n\nThe theater smelled like warmed dust and cut fruit when he walked in, and the light in the booth was doing that slow pulse the dimmers sometimes do when they think people will forgive them for having mood. Noah had written \u201cStandby\u201d on a sticky note and stuck it to the edge of the console because he is a poet even when he means to be mechanical. Vee looked at him and said, \u201cYou look like you met a man who was kind to you and you didn\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d which is almost what had happened, and he said, \u201cI pressed \u2018Go\u2019 in another room,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood, no one died,\u201d and he said, \u201cCorrect, and I wore a shirt,\u201d and she said, \u201cStop, we\u2019re about to be friends and I haven\u2019t decided if I can afford one.\u201d\n\nThe show that night held him like it had missed him, which is something that buildings do not do but which, if you hold them in your mind just right, feels true. He said \u201cStandby\u201d and knew the word in two languages now, the language of switches and the language of breath, and both belonged to him in a way he didn\u2019t have to argue for. The red fabric moved, and the audience, those strangers who are always cousins, made the noise that makes all the rest bearable, and he put his hand on the fader with his whole palm and let himself belong to the lever and the room without tithe or smear, without forgiveness demanded on credit from a future that owed him nothing.\n\nAfter, in the alley with the rain finally good and earnest, Colm lit nothing and stood with his hands empty for once. \u201cWhen a man learns to be two things he must not be surprised when he discovers a third,\u201d he said lightly, then shrugged as if he had not meant to say any of it out loud. Evan laughed without cruelty and said, \u201cIs the third a man who knows where we keep the extra gaff,\u201d and Colm said, \u201cIt is also that,\u201d and then leaned shoulder to shoulder the way he does when he is very tired and very proud of someone else, and they breathed in a rhythm the building under their feet approved of without saying so.",

                              "content": "The first time the blood spread across the glass like a long slow hand, Evan thought of paint. A smear of barn red, opaque, a child's bold brush dragged across the windshield of the Embraer that was taking sixteen people and their pretzels down toward Cleveland. He had time to think ridiculous things when the strobe picked out the feather-spit in the spray, when the lower leading edge of the wing shuddered from the bird they hadn't seen and couldn't have avoided. The hollow thud ran up his hands where they sat on the yoke. Besides, it wasn't his first strike, and he was supposed to be built for noise and weirdness and the sharp physics of sudden things.\n\n\"Bird,\" said Magda in the right seat, her voice fraudulent-calm, the kind they get as a faculty donation in year one of flight school.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said, and then the hand on the glass became a slick, became drops, and he felt his heart run ahead of the plane, bolting.\n\nHe had flown with a little dread before. Everyone did. There was always the pinprick you hid, a thread hung from each flight that you refused to tug because the sweater of your head would unravel. His had been storms, always storms, anvils and green light, lightning that looked like a mouth opening. But this. This wasn't a storm. It wasn't even dangerous, not exactly. The alerts stayed quiet. The engine numbers were steady, though the left one took a breath he could feel through the floor. Not dangerous. Just red. Red and water and the idea of meat.\n\n\"Checklists,\" Magda said.\n\nHe blinked. It was there in his throat, the sweetness of it, the way you know a nosebleed is about to start, a metal penny somewhere in the back of your tongue. He nodded, but didn't reach for the laminated card. The card was right where it always was, in the slot, red triangles and cool font. His hand refused to go.\n\n\"Ev?\" Magda said, softer.\n\n\"I've got it,\" he said, and the \"it\" felt like a lie. The drops began to crawl upward, slower now because their forward momentum had decreased. He watched one in the perimeter of his vision move in a long lazy comma.\n\nHe knew enough to know his own body. The tremor in his forearms. The way air got stuck behind his sternum like he'd swallowed a cough that was too big. Stupid. You could fly through ice. You could arc around storms in the purple black night with lightning ahead making sculptures out of clouds, silhouettes of Greek gods and teeth. You could make decisions at two hundred knots. So, fine, move your hand. He stared at the card until the ink turned into tiny printed islands. Move your hand, Evan.\n\nMagda's hand landed on his wrist like a perching bird, light, a warning that could be read any way you wanted. \"Breathe,\" she said, and the pity in it made something shameful twinge in his belly. \"Breathe, and start the list.\"\n\nHe inhaled. The cabin was pressurized and dry and smelled faintly of coffee and hydraulic dust. The blood, which he could not exactly smell, had nevertheless colonized his head with its idea. Fine. Breathe in, breathe out. He told his hand to leave his lap. The hand didn't. The hand had declared sovereignty, a republic of skin.\n\n\"Checklist: bird strike, suspected,\" Magda said, and took the card herself. Her voice had become hands, making the words into useful items. He answered where he needed to, because you didn't forget the catechism. Halfway through, the droplets had formed a rake of red across the glass. He could see the runway through it, horizontal lights, the clean line of it, the wetness of the day out there. He focused on that, on the over-run lights like things you could walk on. He would centerline this thing, he would taxi it, he would sign paperwork and then he would go to the closet in the crashpad and he would sleep with his head under the coat that smelled like rain.\n\nThey landed. Everyone applauded, because everyone always did on these little runs, and he tried to feel the old soft irony of that, or the old soft fondness. He felt nothing except for an almost empty relief, like the feeling right after you've almost fallen down the stairs. Magda's hand was again a bird. \"You're white,\" she said. \"Like... extra white.\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" he said, and he couldn't tell if it was true.\n\nThe captain of maintenance met them at the gate with a bucket and that fake brightness that ground guys sometimes have when they know the pilots think they're the help. \"Gonna need you to fill out\u2014\"\n\n\"I know,\" Evan said, but it came out a whisper.\n\n\"You okay, Marlowe?\" the man said, and he meant it, but he also meant Am I going to have to call anyone.\n\n\"Fine,\" Evan said. He didn't look at the windshield. He didn't look at the rag in the man's hands with the rust on it. He didn't look at the smear. When they got the debrief in the small room with the bad chair and the black coffee, he held the styrofoam cup like a charm. He thought, idiot, birds hit planes. This isn't a story. This is Tuesday.\n\nHe went back out into the chill slick of the jetway when all was said and done and the passengers had gone and the jet was quiet, and he put his hand on the fuselage. It felt like tapping a sleeping animal. He loved it. He felt something like love anyway, a memory of it. He had the absurd thought that his love should be stronger than a smear on a windshield, that love of a thing should toughen you, like callus or scar.\n\n\"Hey,\" Magda said again, as if perhaps he had gone somewhere. \"Hey. You're shaking.\"\n\n\"It's cold,\" he lied, and walked as if he were not walking.\n\nLater, in the crew room, he took a breath and caught sight of a news clip on the television overhead: a house burned in Chicago, the camera loving the curl of black and orange, and then an old man with a bandage crooked on his head, red moisture leeching through the gauze. For a second he thought he would vomit.\n\nHe put an arm against the wall. He didn't, because he'd learned long ago how not to do things. He went to the locker and took his bag and he went to the bus to the parking lot, and he drove to his crashpad through Columbus twilight, and the trees were black cut-outs and everything felt like it had been recorded, like he was playing back a thing that had already happened.\n\nAt the crashpad, Max from dispatch sat on his couch with a beer and a video game. He grunted. \"You look like someone shot you with flour.\"\n\n\"Bird,\" Evan said.\n\nMax laughed. \"Hate those stupid feather missiles. You good?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Evan said. He showered with the water too hot, as if he could scald the day away, and thought, this is very dramatic, isn't it, Marlowe. He brushed his teeth and saw toothpaste like foam like something else and swore and turned away. He slept for three hours and woke with his heart scudding in his chest, like a horse in a small barn.\n\nTwo days later, on the tarmac in Detroit, he watched a ramp guy trip, land on his palms, and nick his chin. The cut was mean, a tiny quiver in the man's face and then a line, a line that in the cold wind beaded. Evan felt the world go at an angle. A ramp guy. A nick. He went down on his heels by the tug, his breath loud in his ears like he was listening to a shell.\n\nYou can't fly like this, he thought, as if someone else had said it to him. You can't.\n\nHis chief pilot, a man named Fischer with a neat beard and the chill composure of someone who likes maps, called him into the office after the Thursday commuter flights had been farmed out to other souls with other bags under their eyes. The office had a picture of a Cessna framed like a diploma.\n\n\"You want me to guess?\" Fischer said.\n\n\"It's... I don't know,\" Evan said. \"I'm off. I think I'm catching some kind of\u2014\"\n\n\"Not sick,\" Fischer said, like he'd already set the suspects in a line and shot them. \"You're white as a paper cup. And Burke told me you had to sit down in Detroit because you saw a little blood.\"\n\nIt's amazing, how quickly it spreads, he thought. Words. Like weather off a lake.\n\n\"It's not like I'm going to faint,\" he said, though once, twelve years old in a school gym when a girl fell off the pyramid in cheerleading and hit her eyebrow on the floor, the red made the world go velvet and he put his head between his knees like the gym teacher said, and the floor smelled like sneakers and wood polish and something sweet.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" Fischer said, folding his hands so you knew he thought it was important. \"I know men who can't fly in November because the sunlight at four o'clock makes them cry. I know a lady who has to count to two hundred before she pushes up the thrust levers. We used to take people like that out back behind the hangar and tell them to get their heads right. I am not that guy and this isn't that airline. If you're telling me you got a problem with blood, you get to go talk to somebody, and you don't get to fly until somebody says you're good.\"\n\n\"I didn't sign up for sick leave.\"\n\n\"Then take unpaid,\" Fischer said, not unkindly. \"You want to kill sixteen strangers because a passenger has a nosebleed in Row 9?\"\n\nEvan thought of the bird becoming smear becoming hand. He thought of the idea of blood behind the sight of blood, the entire architecture of what it meant. He had always thought he didn't fear mortal things, that his fear was shapeless, fog-like. Now, suddenly: a shape.\n\n\"I'll go home,\" he said.\n\n\"You got family?\"\n\n\"In Westerville,\" he said. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Fischer said. \"Go let them make casseroles. When you come back, we'll still be here.\"\n\nHe didn't feel very casserole. He put his bag in the trunk of the old Mazda he kept in the employee lot because it was paid off and because he had never liked anything that looked expensive. He drove north on 71 until it softened into the Columbus belt, then off into the map he could draw with his eyes closed: the older trees, the weirdly wide streets, the old brick that someone had deliberately left old, the town that had reinvented itself from old new, from Methodist to microbrew without quite forgetting either.\n\nWesterville had a particular quiet to it in summer, like bees in your head. He could hear it as he turned onto State, the storefronts with letters that were trying too hard, the woman he recognized even if he didn't know her name walking a dog with a sweater like a golf club. He stopped in front of his mother's house even though he had not called. The porch boards sang hello under his feet as they had sung when he was nine and twelve and nineteen and left without telling anyone for Indianapolis because he had gotten a job washing airplanes and you didn't announce that you were going to become someone else.\n\nJune opened the door even before he knocked. She had a sixth sense for her child, or that was what she said, and also she never took off that necklace with the shell button and the tiny sliver of sea glass, and it made a small sound against the door, a clink like a teaspoon. She wore a sleeveless blouse that showed the freckle on her shoulder he had memorized as a toddler. Her eyes flicked from his face to his bag to his face again in a flash so quick you could almost miss the calculation.\n\n\"Are you in trouble?\" she said, but with love; in their family \"trouble\" could be anything from a breakup to death.\n\n\"Only the usual,\" he said, and tried to make his mouth look like a joke. She hugged him anyway, the way she hugged, fully, like she was taller than she was, like he could disappear if she didn't do it whole. He felt briefly like a little boy back under the canopy of her life.\n\n\"You smell like airport,\" she said into his collar. \"Come in, make that go away.\"\n\nThe house was saturated with her. Plants that were always about to die but never did. A rug his grandmother had braided, the edges slightly upturned like it was smiling. In the kitchen, Arthur sat at the table with a newspaper and his careful glasses. Arthur wore glasses like a man who had practiced them. Everything about him was careful, though he worked with wood and sometimes got splinters. He raised a hand. He wasn't mean. He wasn't kind either. He was a good stepfather at a distance, which was better than a bad one up close.\n\n\"You hear?\" Arthur said, and did not explain what \"you\" or \"hear\" were supposed to mean. He had that voice of men who assume you live in the same head.\n\n\"I heard birds,\" Evan said, and Arthur snorted in a way that could have been either affectionate or not.\n\n\"Your mother marked the calendar when it's squirrels at the feeder. If I had to mark birds on glass I'd run out of ink.\"\n\n\"Arthur,\" June said. \"Be gentle.\"\n\n\"I'm not being not gentle. I'm being factual,\" he said, which was how you knew he wasn't just being factual.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Evan said. \"I'm taking some leave.\"\n\nShe gave him that look, a twin of Magda's, the same species of human creature who had told you to breathe when you forgot. \"And you came home.\"\n\n\"I've got other places, but none of them have a porch,\" he said. \"Besides, the rent's paid to the landlord of Mom. You can't beat the rate.\"\n\n\"You can always beat the rate if you tell me with enough notice to put a roast in,\" she said, but she brought him a beer that wasn't craft and didn't care. \"Do you want me to call Colm? He was here yesterday for lunch like a thunderstorm.\"\n\nThere it was, the other ghost in the house. The stepbrother whose name could change the temperature in a room. Not because of any fault; because of presence. Colm had a presence like a mantelpiece you didn't choose but someone had bolted above your fireplace. It was stately, beautiful, annoying. He had come with Arthur ten years before and had adapted to the house like ivy, soft and covering and unstoppable.\n\n\"It is a weekday,\" Evan said. \"Doesn't he... do something at night?\"\n\n\"Who can tell,\" Arthur said into his coffee. \"He calls it work. He comes home with money and stories that can't be true. There's a smell like a candle when he's done, and your mother puts out bread on the counter because she thinks he hasn't eaten.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" June said.\n\n\"You do,\" Arthur said, \"but I don't hold it against you. That's what mothers do with creatures who look hungry. They feed them until they stop howling.\"\n\n\"Don't scare him,\" she said. She turned back to Evan. \"Do you want me to call?\"\n\nHe hesitated, and the hesitation had layers. Colm and he had never been one thing. They had been a series of small treaties built and broken and built again. Colm was older by three years but younger in ways that made him dangerous to himself and others. He had a laugh like a match being struck. He had a way of standing in a doorway so that you knew you were in the room and not in the world. He also knew everybody in Westerville who thought they were somebody and most of the people who were truly somebody and didn't look it. If there was a party, he could get in the back door of it. If there was a problem, he could find the ditch it had gotten stuck in and pull.\n\n\"Sure,\" Evan said. \"I could use a\u2014\" What? A wing no, don't say that. A break. A job? \"A distraction.\"\n\nJune nodded and went to the wall where the phone numbers were still written on paper because she didn't trust the small glass rectangle where everything else lived. Evan went to the back door and watched rain starting to form on the maple leaves. The sky had low clouds like a ceiling that needed repainting. He felt weirdly relieved to be in a place where skies were just skies.\n\nHe told himself he had always known how to sit with things, but the truth was he had always moved. He had been a mover since he was old enough to imagine motion. As a child he ran in circles around the coffee table until his mother made him stop not because of furniture but because the circle inside his legs scared her. The first time he saw a cockpit, he had the feeling some people have when they step into a church that is older than their language. He belonged. He'd learned to belong in that small room with a thousand levers, and to pretend the rest of his life was an annex to that room.\n\n\"He's coming,\" June said, too fast, like if she said it slow she would be admitting something. \"He says he was coming anyway.\"\n\n\"He always says that,\" Arthur said.\n\n\"So do you,\" she told him, and he shrugged.\n\nColm arrived like he had a key to the house he didn't; the door opened and he walked in on June's \"come in!\" like a rumor that had decided to become a man. He had that thing where he looked different each time. Today he looked like he'd been to a place where money went to get old, a thrift store where the good suits ended up. His jacket was soft and small at the shoulder, a little too tight, and his shoes were not quite brown or black. He smelled faintly like something hot. It wasn't cologne, exactly. It was like someone had put cinnamon through and then opened a window.\n\n\"Brother,\" he said, and it was the word itself that got you, the way he said it with gratitude as if the world owed him nothing and then gave him this boy to be brother to and he was going to say thank you for the rest of his life. \"You look like you got introduced to winter and told to shake hands.\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" Evan said, default setting.\n\n\"You're not,\" Colm said, delighting. He hugged him and Evan stiffened because he always did. It wasn't dislike. It was the way Colm really hugged, with everything, squeezing the air out of your bones like he was checking for coins. Colm stepped back and tilted his head at the way birds do when they see something shiny. \"You get beat up by a bird?\" he said.\n\n\"Sort of,\" Evan said.\n\n\"He got beat up by the idea of a bird,\" Arthur muttered, because Arthur couldn't stop saying what he thought, truly couldn't, it distressed him not to.\n\n\"So you want an idea of a drink or the real thing?\" Colm said. His eyes, which at rest were brown, caught a light that made them look molten sometimes, like they held a little fire. \"There's a place, and there's a person at the place, and the person thinks I am a person who knows other people.\"\n\n\"My big dream,\" Evan said. \"To be a person who knows a person.\"\n\n\"You joke,\" Colm said. He always took jokes personally because to him everything was a gift you could unwrap, and if you didn't unwrap it he couldn't tell whether you liked him. \"But it's a thing. The person is at the Evergreen. They do shows. They are not, you know, Broadway with the chorus lines. But they are... something. And they have a thing that needs a voice and a hand and maybe somebody who can read a map.\"\n\n\"Theater,\" Arthur said, as if the word were a lost relative.\n\n\"Theater,\" Colm said. He rolled the word in his mouth. \"I told them I knew a man who can talk a pilot into landing in a hurricane, and who can make a room like a cockpit, calm. Fine, not a hurricane. A storm that no one else will fly. I said you had a voice like a switch warming up.\"\n\n\"You're selling me like a table saw,\" Evan said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Colm said, unabashed. \"But it's for good.\"\n\n\"What's the job?\" June asked, as if she were not going to approve either way.\n\n\"There is a show,\" Colm said. \"They call it a devised piece. That's arts talk for we are going to do a thing that isn't a musical and it isn't a play and it isn't the news. They want someone to narrate it and someone to do the\u2014\" He made a gesture with his hand that could have been puppets or lights or pressing an elevator button. \"\u2014the cues, the buttons. The person who does that had a baby and then found out she liked having a baby more than having a job. Imagine.\"\n\n\"They want a stage manager,\" June translated.\n\n\"Is that a thing?\" Colm said. \"Then yes.\"\n\n\"I can barely manage myself,\" Evan said.\n\n\"Which is why you're perfect. You need to be better at it. They will boss you. They will be short of funds. They will give you drink tickets and pretend it is money. You will look at girls who pretend they don't look at anyone, and they will look back. And you will not be in the sky, which, from what I've heard, is your current prescription.\"\n\n\"He's not not in the sky because he doesn't want it,\" Arthur said. \"He's on leave.\"\n\n\"I'm not a patient,\" Evan said, though it occurred to him that people who said that usually were.\n\nColm leaned against the doorframe, a habit of his that looked casual and felt like strategy, because now he was between you and leaving. \"It's not for always,\" he said, softer, the sell now a whisper. \"It's for a while. And you'll be around. And I can lend you my bicycle\u2014\"\n\n\"I have a car.\"\n\n\"I don't know that about you,\" Colm said, and he didn't smile; his face was sincere in a way that made you want to either confess something or pretend to be braver. \"I know you fly. And I know\u2014\" he paused, not for drama (though he loved drama) but for honesty\u2014 \"that sometimes, when I walk past the wall where she puts the pictures, your picture looks like you want to run. This isn't running. This is standing in a room and making sure it becomes something. Try it.\"\n\n\"Don't push him,\" June said, which, coming from her to Colm, sounded like a prayer you say because your heart is full and you don't like what comes out when it's overfull.\n\n\"I'm not pushing,\" Colm said. \"I'm pointing. I'm a great pointer. Everyone says so.\"\n\n\"You've met two people today,\" Arthur said. \"The barista and my wife.\"\n\n\"And the third person is the person I know who needs a person,\" Colm said, still smiling. He moved away from the doorframe, gave back the way out. \"You can say no. You can tell me to walk out and I'll walk out. And then I'll walk one more block and lean into the alley and call Tess and say I tried. And she'll say, what do you want me to do, I need someone for tonight's tech run, it's not like someone is going to fall out of the sky.\"\n\nAt that, something in Evan made a bitter noise, a laugh that wasn't a laugh. \"I know,\" he said. His mouth did what it always did: it decided before he did. \"I'll go.\"\n\n\"You'll go,\" Colm repeated, as if that had been his prayer. \"Good. Tonight?\"\n\nJune made a face, which women have made since there were sons. \"He just got in.\"\n\n\"I'll sleep later,\" Evan said. \"If I sleep now I'll dream I'm in the plane and the glass is\u2014\" He stopped, because he had never said it out loud, and because saying it made it less and more at the same time.\n\nThey went out into evening. It wasn't quite rain; it was the weather where drops are arranged so far apart that each one feels lonely. Colm drove because of course he did, because he always took wheels like they were a throne. The car hummed like it had eaten too much honey. The radio played a station that played old songs by women who sounded like they had unscrewed their throats and let the gods sing through. The town slid past\u2014the ice cream place with the kid in a sweatshirt though it was June, the library with its windows lit, the fountain that had always reminded Evan of an upside-down chandelier.\n\n\"You okay?\" Colm said, as if he'd waited the appropriate number of minutes to ask, the number printed in an invisible manual he kept in his chest.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Evan lied, and then didn't. \"No. It's stupid.\"\n\n\"It never is.\"\n\n\"I'm a pilot,\" Evan said, and heard how untrue that sounded. \"I don't get to do this. I don't get to\u2014\" He gestured with a hand that made the turn signal click. \"\u2014be undone by a thing that wouldn't scare a student nurse. The world is full of blood. It's in us right now. I'm fine with it in me. I'm not fine with it on the outside of glass. I've been fine. Now I'm not.\"\n\nColm was quiet, which was rare enough that Evan looked at him. His face had gone profile, an old coin. He looked older when he was quiet. \"When I was ten,\" Colm said, \"my father cut his hand on a lathe. Not your father. Mine.\"\n\n\"I know which one you mean,\" Evan said.\n\n\"You didn't then,\" Colm said, not gently but not cruel, either. \"He was alone in the shop because that was the curse he chose, to always be alone with the things he loved more than us. He called me in because he couldn't find the towel we used for oil. I saw the inside of his hand. There are so many pieces, and they were all living. I fainted. And when I woke up he slapped me. Not because he was cruel. Because he was angry I had done something he did not expect. He said, don't ever drop out like that. Don't ever. And I've been trying to never ever since.\"\n\n\"How's it working out?\"\n\nColm smiled. \"Depends who you ask.\"\n\nThe Evergreen Theatre looked like somewhere you took first dates because it would make you look smarter than you were. The door was painted green in case you didn't get the metaphor, and there was a flyer for a show with hands on it, so many hands, all the hands making a circle. The lobby smelled like coffee and carpet and ambition. A woman in her forties with the saving grace of a crooked nose came down the stairs with her arms full of papers. Her hair was short and gray like she had dared herself to go gray and had won. She carried herself like a person who could say \"no\" and make you grateful.\n\n\"This is him,\" Colm said, like he'd brought her a cat and was hoping she didn't have allergies. \"Evan. The one I told you about.\"\n\n\"Tess,\" she said, untucking a hand. \"Bless you, because I am not above blessing. We're bleeding man-hours.\"\n\nEvan's stomach twanged at the word bleeding, a string plucked. He made his face into a guy face, a here to help face. \"Happy to help.\"\n\n\"You any good with light boards?\" she said, not waiting for the niceties because niceties had been chased out by need.\n\n\"What's a light board,\" he said, honest.\n\n\"Good,\" she said, not missing. \"You'll do what I tell you. Tonight is spacing and cues. Tomorrow is paper tech. Friday we let them think it's a show. There's a script somewhere but we're pretending we don't need it. Got it?\"\n\n\"Got it,\" he said.\n\n\"And you,\" she said to Colm, \"can go home, because I'm not paying for extra eyes.\"\n\n\"You never do,\" he said, and then leaned to kiss her cheek, a gesture so old and gentle it made Evan think they'd known each other longer than the theater had been a theater. \"Don't burn him,\" he said.\n\n\"Me? Burn?\" she said with a snort. \"The place burns. I just put signs on the exits.\"\n\nColm was already halfway to the door. He looked back once, a habit as old as trains, and his look said what he always said when he was leaving you anywhere: you can do this. It was theatrical and real.\n\nEvan followed Tess into the black box that was actually only partly black and more of a charcoal that held light like water. The stage was a flat plane with tape lines in colors that looked like confetti to him. The seats were steep, telling him that whoever sat here had to agree to be sat upon. On the back wall, a faded painted tree suggested that once, not long ago, they'd pretended to be in a park.\n\n\"You're late,\" said a girl whose job it had been, apparently, to tell someone this no matter the hour.\n\n\"He is not late, he's new,\" Tess said. \"There's a difference, and the difference is that 'late' suggests fault and 'new' suggests hope.\"\n\n\"I like her,\" the girl said, and did not even look at him. \"Hi. I'm Vee.\"\n\nShe looked like a person whose face had been designed by someone with a fondness for lines. She had lines around her mouth from smiling and lines on her forehead from other things, and a haircut like she didn't want to be asked about it. Her eyes were clever, which you couldn't say about everyone because not everyone had eyes that had been taught at school. \"Do you know where the subwoofer is?\" she said to him.\n\n\"In my car,\" he said, and that at least made her face change.\n\n\"Okay, he's funny,\" Vee said to Tess. \"We keep him.\"\n\n\"He's here because we lost Sheila,\" Tess said to the cluster of actors in sweats and scarves. \"Not lost lost, just baby lost. This is Evan. He is going to shut things up and turn things on and tell you when to do things.\"\n\n\"You could just call that God,\" said a tall man who had shaved his head and then put a hat on it.\n\n\"You can call it whatever makes you feel special,\" Tess said. \"Places for spacing. Evan: booth.\"\n\nHe learned on the job because there was no other way. The light board was a land of buttons that were numbered and then numbered again in case you were blind. Tess told him that faders were friends. He put his fingers on them and something soothed in him because a small part of him had loved buttons his whole life. He had always loved the command that was not command, the way a lever makes a wall of light appear and you can pretend you did that, like a god with good software.\n\n\"Blackout,\" Tess said.\n\n\"Blackout,\" he said, and drew the fader down until the world became night. His stomach unspooled. There was something here he could love possibly, something like the way sky happens in pieces.\n\nThey ran the tech, which meant they did not act exactly, but moved the things you would later assume had been always in the right place. He watched, he obeyed, he pressed \"Go\" on the board when Tess said \"Go,\" and it felt like flying in that he was not the thing but he was adjacent to the thing. He watched Vee and the tall man with the hat and a girl with a voice like a spoon tap and a man who moved like he hadn't decided if he was a dancer or a tree. They called the piece \"Rend,\" which made Evan remember the smear on the windshield and he told himself he did not have to be triggered by nouns.\n\nAt break, he went down to the stage to coil a cable like they taught you, which is to say you did it right or it would kink and kick like a snake. Vee watched him. \"You did that like you've done it before.\"\n\n\"I coil things in my sleep,\" he said.\n\nShe tilted her head. \"What were you before you were a stage manager for an hour?\"\n\n\"Pilot,\" he said, and waited for the inevitable \"cool.\"\n\nShe said \"Oh,\" but not like that. \"So why are you... here.\"\n\n\"Leave,\" he said; it was the word that had become his answer.\n\n\"Did you break something?\"\n\n\"My brain,\" he said, somewhat obscenely proud. \"It's on recall.\"\n\n\"Good,\" she said, and he blinked. \"Better now than after. Are you going back?\"\n\n\"Dunno,\" he said, and meant the lack of knowing like it was a faith he was trying on, like a ridiculous hat.\n\nShe nodded like someone who had decided not to care too much for a week or a year. \"You should drink water,\" she said, practical. \"There's a jug in the green room. It tastes like cucumbers because Sophie thinks that's hydration.\"\n\nHe drank cucumber water. He watched actors take tiny bites of apples like they were feeding birds out of their own hands. He watched Tess not look at a list and then know everything. He pressed the \"Go\" button when told. The night began to feel like a machine with a rhythm. He watched his body not flinch when someone said \"blood\" in a line about families. He watched himself not be smaller than he had been in the office with Fischer. He watched himself imagine a future that wasn't a cliff.\n\nAt the end of the night, Tess did the thing she probably did every night of her life: she stood on the stage, pretended not to be sentimental, and said, \"Good work, tomorrow eight,\" and then she turned to Evan. \"We pay with checks because the computer hates me. They will bounce if I sign them. So you're paid on Wednesdays and we give you drink tickets for the bar because it's easier.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, and meant, thank you for making a way for me to be in a room.\n\nVee came up to him at the door and said, \"You're better when you don't think,\" and he almost said, \"my whole life will be that sentence,\" but he didn't, because he thought she would get it so hard it would hurt.\n\nOutside, the town had decided to be night. The street was an illustration drawn by a child who had learned perspective yesterday. Colm leaned against the green door, his hands in his pockets because he thought pockets were a personality. He looked wrong for the street and also like the street had shifted to suit him.\n\n\"You waited,\" Evan said, surprised in exactly the way you shouldn't be if you knew Colm.\n\n\"Of course,\" Colm said. \"He was good?\"\n\n\"He pressed buttons with reverence,\" Tess said from behind him, putting key in lock. \"Which is more than I get from my own spine most days. Thank you for the delivery. Pick him up tomorrow? Or does the boy drive himself?\"\n\n\"I can walk,\" Evan said, though he would not, not because he was lazy, but because he had learned to be driven.\n\n\"I will pick him up and feed him something the color of wood,\" Colm said.\n\n\"I don't need to be fed,\" Evan said.\n\n\"You always do,\" Colm said, and there was that other thing in his voice, the thing that came in when it wanted to: authority. Not the authority of a man who knows, but of a thing older than a man. It passed like a cloud. Evan told himself he had imagined it. He told himself that ten times.\n\nBack at the house, June had left a light on like a lighthouse and a note on the fridge that said in her saintly half-cursive: Turkey soup, no actual turkey. He warmed it in a pot because she did not trust microwaves and had told them since they were kids that buttons in the kitchen would make them sterile. He ate it and tasted salt and something under it like thyme. He thought, I am okay in this hour.\n\nHe slept in his old room with the window that had always known a small draft. He dreamed\u2014not of glass and birds, which would have been too obvious\u2014but of a theater with no walls and a voice like his mother's saying \"places\" and Colm's laughter like the sound a match makes. He woke once with his throat locked, the way it locked when he saw red. He went to the kitchen. The light under the microwave clock was green like a feeling you could make disappear with your fist.\n\nWhen he turned around, he saw himself reflected in the window over the sink: his own face, older than it should be at thirty-three; the street light doing a halo it had no right to. And behind him, in the next room where the house held its darkness like a hand holds an egg, a suggestion of someone standing, tall, patient.\n\nHe turned yes, because he was not a coward even if he was.\n\nThe room was empty. Of course it was. It was a house at midnight in a town that liked to pretend there were more things in it than there were. He drank water. He went back to bed and slept like he was falling through a cloud and finding ground and falling again.\n\nMorning came like a song he had half-remembered, the way morning comes when you are in a house that knows you and will forgive your noises. June put coffee in him like a legal drug. Arthur argued with the paper because the paper had opinions. Colm arrived with a bag from a bakery that made cinnamon rolls the size of helmets. He flung the bag on the table like a man throwing gauntlets. \"Eat, or the gods will be angry,\" he said.\n\n\"What gods,\" Arthur said.\n\n\"Mine,\" Colm said. He smiled at Evan over the pastry. \"Ready for day two?\"\n\n\"I'm ready to keep my hand moving when someone says 'go,'\" Evan said.\n\n\"Look at you, a joiner,\" Colm said with delight. \"I never thought I'd see the day.\"\n\n\"You never saw any of the days,\" June said in that way that was light except for the half of it that wasn't.\n\nThey went again to the Evergreen, and again he pressed buttons and coiled cables and tried not to think of himself as a man who had flown but couldn't stand the sight of a finger nick. He watched Vee make herself into someone else and then into herself again. He watched Tess take a call in the corner and say, \"Yes, but no,\" and then say, \"Fine,\" and then say, \"We'll make it work,\" three times. He learned more than he had thought he would. He stood behind the light board in the utter dark and felt powerful and small.\n\nAt break, he stepped outside into an alley that smelled like summer and trash that had not yet decided what it wanted to be. He leaned against the brick. He looked up and let himself look at the slice of sky he could get. It was ordinary day-blue. It did not make his heart run. A pigeon flopped off a ledge and then thought better of it and settled. He laughed out loud, not because it was funny but because it was ordinary.\n\nHe didn't hear Colm come up; he never did. Colm had a way of showing up like a thought you had decided to have. He held out a hand with a paper cup. \"Water with slices of lemon because cucumbers are an abomination,\" he said.\n\n\"How did you\u2014\"\n\n\"I'm everywhere,\" Colm said. He leaned next to Evan and let their shoulders be parallel. He had always known how to stand in exactly the right place to make you feel like you had a brother even if you didn't think you needed one. \"You look less like a deer in a stadium.\"\n\n\"I'm a vole in a library,\" Evan said. He took the cup. The lemon made the water taste like old books.\n\n\"You'll go back to the sky,\" Colm said without punctuation.\n\n\"I will,\" Evan said, because he didn't know if that was comfort or threat and he didn't have the energy to make it either.\n\n\"Do you know why the blimp that lives over by the highway moves so slowly, and why it still scares me even though it's ridiculous?\" Colm said.\n\n\"No,\" Evan said, because if you told him magic he would listen.\n\n\"It is too big and too quiet. Things that are that big should not be quiet. I know that like I know I shouldn't look straight at the moon when it's full because it will break my neck. You'll go back when you can.\" He took a breath like he was taking in more than air. \"I brought you here for a reason.\"\n\n\"I assumed you brought me here because Tess needed hands and you owe her fourteen things.\"\n\n\"Seventeen, but who's counting.\" Colm shifted, and when he did a warmth came off him that wasn't weather. It wasn't the cup. It wasn't the alley. It was him, and if Evan had been an animal he would have sidled closer to it and then hated himself for that. \"I wanted you to be in a room where making a world does not ask for blood.\"\n\nEvan, who had been about to smile something away, stopped. \"What do you mean,\" he said, but not like a question.\n\n\"I mean, you go up and you make a world every time, and that world demands a tithe. Sometimes the tithe is coffee and sleep. Sometimes it's something else. I wanted to put you in a world that took softer currency for a while.\"\n\nHe looked at Colm, for the first time that day looked all the way. \"You talk like a man who's always selling. But it's for me, isn't it. The sell is to me.\"\n\n\"Most of my selling is for me,\" Colm said with that little sideways offense at himself that made him charming. \"This one, I think I get nothing from. Except you.\"\n\n\"Leave it to you to make that sound like a trick.\" He paused. \"Thanks.\"\n\n\"You don't have to thank me,\" Colm said, which was always suspicious. He reached up and absently plucked at the brick with his nails. Dust made a small cloud that was golden for a second. He smiled at it like a king.\n\nEvan was tired. Tired in the way that isn't sleep but weight. He thought suddenly of those pictures that used to be in science books, of a drop of red magnified, those smooth coins of cells, stacks of them like gummy candy. He felt the room of himself shift. He put his hand on the brick.\n\n\"Don't faint on me,\" Colm said, but lightly.\n\n\"I'm not,\" Evan said; then, surprising himself, he said, \"Stay.\"\n\n\"I am not leaving,\" Colm said, and something in his voice said, I don't.\n\nLater, he would try to remember if any of this had been a clue, if any of this had laid down a strand that could make a net he could pull himself with. He would think of Colm's heat like a foundry, of the way the alley had gone very quiet as if even pigeons had held their breath. He would think of Tess saying \"blessing\" like she meant it. He would think of the way, on State Street that night, a dog had crossed in front of them and bowed, a solemn, strange bow, before running into the dark.\n\nFor now, he breathed next to his brother who was also a stranger and tried to outlast a feeling that had a face and a name. He was at the beginning. He didn't know that yet. He tilted his head and listened to the theater under his feet, the way you listen to a plane: not to what it is doing, but to the change in what it is doing.\n\n\"Places,\" Tess called from inside, her voice carrying like a cathedral bell through the brick. The word sounded different, like someone had hung a ribbon on it. Evan wiped his hand on his jeans. He went in. He turned one light to half, and then another, and then let the dark take the edges. He found the \"Go\" with his thumb without looking, the way you find the pulse in your own wrist when you want to know if you're still here. He clicked. The stage breathed, and the story, whatever it was, came toward him with open hands.",

                              "content": "On the third day he learned how to be a clock. That was what Tess called it when she walked him through the paper tech, a ritual that made theater people look like accountants and feel like generals. They sat at a folding table that had seen other wars and marked time in pencil. The table was covered with paper: the script printed large and broken into blocks, the light cues written in the margins in Tess\u2019s loping hand, sound cues in block letters as if naming them could keep them from going feral. Around them the actors sprawled on the stairs like cats that had agreed to be human for a while. Vee had a pen she stuck behind her ear and forgot and then went searching for, accusing the air of theft. The tall man with the hat had placed the hat on his knee like an old dog. Sophie, who was small and precise, was sewing something that might have been a sleeve or might have been a metaphor; her needle made tiny audible tsks as it moved. Tess tapped the script with a pencil that had teeth dents in it and said, \u201cThis is where you become the heartbeat. I say \u2018Standby\u2019, you say \u2018Lights standing by\u2019 and \u2018Sound standing by,\u2019 and then I say \u2018Go\u2019 and you move the world. If the world does not move we pretend we meant it. That is ninety percent of the job. The other ten percent is making people drink water and putting out little fires I start.\u201d\n\nHe liked the formality, because it gave his body something to dress itself in. There was relief in being allowed to be literal. He drew a little box in his notebook each time a cue happened, just to see it appear. He wrote \u201cLX\u201d for lights and \u201cSND\u201d for sounds and \u201cPRJ\u201d for the projector they insisted was not a projector but an instrument, and then he found himself shading them like a child fills in a coloring book when he needs the edges to matter. He liked the way Tess handed him the baton without any ceremony and with all of it. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one looking at the whole,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich means you are allowed to be boring. Boring is underrated.\u201d\n\nThey went through \u201cRend\u201d on paper, and even just that felt like a kind of violence softened by instruction. It was a piece about tearing and mending, which was the kind of sentence that made Arthur\u2019s mouth twitch in disdain when he read it in the community calendar and then circled the showtime anyway. It had been built from interviews and arguments and an afternoon when the company had brought in old blankets and ripped them and then stitched them and then tried not to cry about things that were not blankets. There was a scene where Vee stood with a pair of scissors and did not cut anything while speaking a litany of all the times in her life she had wanted to open a seam and put her head in. There was a scene where the tall man in the hat told a story about his grandmother\u2019s hands, and he undressed the hat from his head and held it like a bowl and showed you it was empty, and then at the end of the scene he turned it over and something fell out you had not seen him put there. There was a section with a table and the kind of lights that look like they belong in an interrogation; Tess wanted those to blink and not blink, to threaten blinking. There was, in Act Two, they insisted on calling it Act Two though no one sat long enough to deserve Greek, a sequence with red fabric that moved like water when six of them moved together, a river that was actually six arms and something about bodies making bodies.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Tess said, her pencil on a line that said in his own looping handwriting, because she had made him write it, INFINITE RED FABRIC ENTERS LIKE A SECRET. \u201cYou will want to go early because it\u2019s beautiful. Don\u2019t. Let them carry it to you.\u201d\n\nHe swallowed and nodded and wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t help beauty,\u201d which made Vee look over his shoulder and laugh without cruelty. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right, Captain,\u201d she said, calling him that like a joke she knew still had teeth in it.\n\nThey did spacing, which was less about space than about watching bodies learn to trust tape. He learned a new palette of words. \u201cSpike\u201d was a piece of tape telling a table where it would be later; \u201cspiking\u201d became holy. \u201cHold\u201d was what you said when someone was about to die or when a chair leg made an awful sound; when you said \u201cHold,\u201d the air obeyed you. Tess gave him the \u201cHold\u201d with a look, like you might give someone you like the keys to your car because you think their nervousness will keep them from doing stupid things. \u201cYou don\u2019t say it to feel large,\u201d she told him in the dark between cues, where their faces glowed with emergency light and a feeling like belonging. \u201cYou say it because something needs you to.\u201d\n\nAt lunch he followed Vee out the side door into the sliver of alley that pretended it was a patio if you squinted. The sun made a rectangle on the asphalt like a trap you would gladly walk into and then stand in forever. She had a sandwich whose bread looked too good for someone who said \u201cI\u2019m broke\u201d as if that were a choice she had made with pride. He had the last of one of June\u2019s soups in a jar and a plastic spoon with a crack like a fault line. They leaned against the dumpster the way you lean against a problem and decide you will not be the one to solve it but you will keep it company. Vee said, \u201cTess told me something but I think she told everyone because she is nosy and also kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did that change in the universe,\u201d he asked, aiming for lightness and landing close enough.\n\n\u201cThat you flew,\u201d Vee said, \u201cand that you\u2019re not flying because your head remembered something it didn\u2019t want to remember. She said you\u2019re not a hero. She meant it like a compliment. We don\u2019t have much use for them here.\u201d\n\nHe ate a spoon of soup and felt its heat slide down like a truce. \u201cI like jobs where I\u2019m a hinge,\u201d he said. \u201cYou turn me and a thing opens. That\u2019s all. Pilots get told we\u2019re gods because people don\u2019t think about the plane when it\u2019s doing what they want. I liked being the hinge better.\u201d\n\nVee nodded like someone who collected nods. \u201cI used to want to be the door,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I was. It was too much. Everyone coming through. Everyone slamming you when they were angry. Hinges get to hide.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like a vow,\u201d he said. He wanted to ask her what she had been the door to, but he had learned enough about Vee in three days to know she counted questions given to her and returned change later.\n\nBack inside, they started again. He stood behind the board. He found that there was a prayer in \u201cStandby,\u201d especially when Tess made the word a sigh and not an order. \u201cStandby cue thirty-one through thirty-eight,\u201d she said, and in the booth his treble repeated it, and in repeating it turned it into something that would happen. At cue forty-two they had their first accident, which Tess took like a gift from some god she didn\u2019t believe in because it meant they had met that god early in the run.\n\n\u201cHold,\u201d said the universe, except it was the tall man slaughtering his alphabet in a cough that was more like a bark. He had knelt to adjust a piece of tape he had decided he didn\u2019t like and came up too fast. The hat let out a little exclamation point and fell. He put a hand to his face and then took it down and there was, inevitable and delicate and unstoppable, a slickness under his nostrils that gleamed before it fell.\n\nEvan did not know an amount of red could be so precise and so ruinous at once. It wasn\u2019t a gush, it wasn\u2019t the obscene hand that had spread across a windshield, but his body didn\u2019t consult nuance. His chest unlaced itself and tried to leave; his vision contracted to a tunnel that saw only that one drop. He had an absurd thought that if he could make it not drop he would be back in the plane before the shudder, before the spray. He put his hand on the console and felt the hard edges of faders like banisters. Tess\u2019s voice reached him from a far country that was one step away. She was saying \u201cHold,\u201d and then she was saying \u201cHouse to half please,\u201d and then she was in the aisle, and then she was a hand on the tall man\u2019s arm, and then she was elbows and cloth and people breathing the breath of what now.\n\nHe heard himself say \u201cHold,\u201d late and echoing, like he\u2019d heard himself say it the first time he had told a plane to stop. The word entered him and moved the air, and the moving air did a tiny thing to his rib cage: it reminded his ribs that they, too, were banisters. He took a breath and felt only half of it, which was more than a quarter and thus counted as progress. He reached blindly for the headset that hung on a nail, because if he could put something over his ears it would be like putting his mother\u2019s palm on his head, that old warmth.\n\n\u201cFirst aid kit?\u201d Vee said from somewhere to his left, and he could hear in her voice that she wanted to catch it, the drop, with words, and that words were not cups.\n\n\u201cGreen room, top of the fridge,\u201d Sophie said, and already her feet were making that sneaker squeak that made all of this seem like a cartoon that would hurt only if you looked sideways at it.\n\nThe tall man said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine, it always does this,\u201d and he sounded like that at every nosebleed for his whole life, that apology shape. Someone handed him a cloth that used to be white, because every theatre had an item that used to be white and had surrendered. Blood made a dot and then a bigger dot. The iron smell that science says you do not actually smell because smell is not iron but your brain\u2019s idea of iron arrived like a memory of pennies. Evan\u2019s wrist throbbed the way it had in the cockpit when Magda had used that perilous voice.\n\n\u201cHead down, pinch the bridge,\u201d Tess said, and then, \u201cDon\u2019t tilt back, you\u2019re not trying to irrigate your throat,\u201d and then to Sophie, \u201cGloves, get him gloves because we\u2019re pretending to be professionals.\u201d\n\nEvan found himself gripping the board. He told his heart, absurdly, that he would be with it in a moment. He opened the drawer to his right\u2014Sheila\u2019s drawer of things she hadn\u2019t yet sorted and would now be his to sort\u2014and found tape and cough drops and a box of nitrile. He put a glove on because doing one thing he had done before could sometimes persuade the body to follow; he had put on gloves in planes and in kitchens and when Arthur had taught him to sand a board just so. The glove snapped around his wrist with a sound that took the room into its mouth and softened its corners. He moved down the steps like a man in a pool, determined to reach the other side. He crouched by the tall man, who was saying he was fine and whose face contradicted that in a dozen little shards.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Evan said, his voice without echo, \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d He could feel the tremor in his own hand, a low rpm hum. He could also feel the weight of what this was, which was not an emergency in any universe where they had invented words for real emergencies. He put the glove on himself and then got the tall man to tilt forward just enough that the body could do the job it had always done. He pinched with the tall man\u2019s fingers, counting in a quiet rote that surprised him: \u201cOne two three four,\u201d as if there were a lever that wanted to come up at two hundred. \u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it. Stay with us.\u201d\n\nVee handed him a cold compress from a little packet that must have lived in that green room\u2019s nest for years. He pressed it gently to the bridge with his knuckles so he didn\u2019t have to look straight at the red that was not yet red, that was still a wetness. The tall man\u2019s breath slowed, and in the slowing there was a sound like rails taken up out of the road when winter ends. The dot on the cloth quit its ambition and went ordinary. The iron smell did its quiet exit, the way smells leave as if insulted you noticed them in the first place.\n\n\u201cLook at that,\u201d Tess said, her praise a dry palm. \u201cA man who takes a command. Can we keep you in the booth and also in the apocalypse.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly if I get to write the checklist,\u201d he said, breath returning in increments. His knee hurt from the crouch and he welcomed the hurt like a hand on his shoulder. He handed the compress to the tall man, who was called Marcus, he remembered then, because it mattered now. \u201cYou good?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed,\u201d Marcus said, as if that were a diagnosis. \u201cI always, if it\u2019s dry and then I bend too fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cHydrate,\u201d Sophie said, the way someone says \u201crepent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in ten,\u201d Tess announced to the room at large, as if she hadn\u2019t already stolen back the ten with her competence. She looked at Evan while everyone dispersed, and he saw in her face that relief that is tinged with guilt: you thanked whatever had made the accident small and given you a chance to practice your kindness, and you hated that you were the sort of animal who could be grateful for proof of your own capacities.\n\nHe went back up to the booth and did not sit until he could sit ordinary. He put his hands flat on the console and let the ridges of the fader track press lines into his palms, geography he could carry into the next room. The word \u201cbleed,\u201d which had been a siren, subsided into the background noise of language. He felt a small swell of pride, and then a wash of shame at the pride, and then he allowed both to be there because he could not spend his life refusing emotions their passports.\n\nThey resumed, and the red fabric sequence came later, and it was, to his horror and pleasure, as beautiful as he had feared. The six of them came in with the cloth pooled in their hands, and for a second it looked insolent and dead. Then they lifted and the thing became a river, it became a weather system, it became every curtain you had ever hidden behind and every artery that had ever pumped and every flag you had ever been asked to salute and couldn\u2019t. It moved like he wished he felt: continuously, without snag, making a surface for light to play on. He did not go early, as instructed. He waited until Tess\u2019s breath next to him changed, a slight click in it, and then he pressed \u201cGo\u201d and the low side light turned the red into a kind of velvet dream. He might have closed his eyes for a second because in the dark he imagined the cockpit again, the purple-grey of cloud when the warning light is on and you have to decide. When he opened them he was still in the booth and Marcus was not bleeding and Vee was not cutting anything with her scissors that were always a threat and never the weapon.\n\nAt dinner home was a great blousy bowl of spaghetti made by a woman who thought of pasta as a moral stance. June had sauce on her wrist and didn\u2019t notice for twenty minutes because she was telling a story about a man at the bank who had made her laugh by sneezing exactly like a puppy. Arthur pretended not to be charmed and then told them how much money the bank had made off people who couldn\u2019t subtract and then made himself a policeman of garlic bread. Colm arrived late, not because he could not arrive on time but because he believed time was a curve he could lean against and then straighten with his hands. He set a paper bag on the counter like an apology for what he would be later. It contained olives in a container that leaked and two kinds of cheese June would approve of because they didn\u2019t call themselves anything. Colm kissed June\u2019s cheek and touched Arthur\u2019s shoulder with a knuckle. He looked at Evan over the steam like this was another show they had both wandered into without tickets.\n\n\u201cHow is the church,\u201d Arthur said to him, and then to Evan, for explanation, \u201cHe ministers to the theater people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a deacon of poor decisions,\u201d Colm said. He snagged an olive with his fingers and chewed it in a way that made you think olive should pay him rent. \u201cYour boy distinguished himself today.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have informants,\u201d Evan said, and Vee would have liked the way he made the word a dare.\n\n\u201cI have eyes that tell me things,\u201d Colm said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t run out of the back of the room and leave a cartoon cutout of yourself in the door. You did a small good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a nose,\u201d Evan said, and then the words surprised him, came unbidden, \u201cIt was not a wing.\u201d He could feel the minute temperature shift that came when you told a room what had hurt you last. Arthur looked at him and did not say a thing. June did the little frown she did when she was about to say too much and then chose not to, an art she had had to practice. Colm nodded as if mentally moving a bead on an abacus.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Colm said lightly to the table in general, \u201ca man will come and ask me to find a dog.\u201d\n\nThis was how he was; he dropped a sentence like a small explosive and then watched you not react, and then he knew who you were. June said, \u201cThere are posters,\u201d practical, a mother to all lost domesticated creatures.\n\n\u201cThey want a particular dog,\u201d Colm said. \u201cA dog that has learned to open the latch on the backyard gate with his teeth. The man says he loves the dog and I believe him because he stopped for a full two seconds in his telling and looked like someone took his throat away.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what is this to you,\u201d Arthur said, though he was smiling despite himself, because he liked to pretend he was immune to Colm and then wake up to having driven him to a thing and waited with the engine running.\n\n\u201cThis is how I make rent,\u201d Colm said, so open you almost forgot to be angry. \u201cI find dear things for people who lost them. Sometimes it is a dog. Sometimes it is a ring they never owned in the first place and will sell to feel noble. Sometimes it is a way to leave without breaking a window. Sometimes it is a furnace repairman who won\u2019t charge three hundred dollars to come and press a reset button. People don\u2019t know how to ask. They know how to list. I like turning lists into requests.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fixer,\u201d Arthur said, professional disgust nicely sanded with affection.\n\n\u201cI am a pointer,\u201d Colm said. He bowed his head to the bowl like he thought it was holy. \u201cI stand in a room and sometimes the air moves for me. It\u2019s ridiculous, really. Do you have more bread, June.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner, when Arthur washed dishes in his methodical way and June triaged the dry with a towel she swore made plates shinier than the machine, Colm stood at the back door like he\u2019d been asked to guard the night. Evan went out with him into the hum. Fireflies began to assert themselves in the yard, insolent punctuation. The neighbor\u2019s maple was a gossipy silhouette. The air had that sugary thickness Ohio got when it remembered the cornfields around it and decided to marinate you.\n\nColm lit a cigarette and then passed it to Evan, and Evan made a face but took it because it was old and stupid and had a taste like some memory he couldn\u2019t name. He didn\u2019t smoke, which was why in moments like this he did; he liked choosing his poisons when the others were choosing him. Colm watched the smoke lift like a thought having second thoughts.\n\n\u201cI saw a thing today,\u201d Colm said finally, in that way he had of making the thing he was about to say feel like an ethical problem rather than a story. \u201cI wanted your take, which is either rich or pathetic depending on the hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs if my take is anything,\u201d Evan said, blowing smoke into a shape and then being ashamed of himself for enjoying the shape.\n\n\u201cDowntown, the new coffee place that believes chairs should be a lesson,\u201d Colm said. \u201cA boy was standing with a leaflet in his fingers and talking to a woman who had turned her face away. He was talking softly, which is a trick, and he was making the leaflet into a promise. He said the word family four times and the word tired once. I wanted to stand between them because the leaflet had too many exclamation points. I wanted to ask the boy who was tired, him or the woman, because that matters. And then\u2014\u201d He paused, not for effect, but to be exact. \u201cThen the boy flinched at nothing. Like the air hit him. He looked past the woman for a second, and then he folded the leaflet backwards and he left it on the counter like a tip. The woman cried in the coffee smell and then ordered a drink that was nothing but sugar and milk. I saw that and I thought, I can stand in rooms and point all day, but sometimes the room points back.\u201d\n\nEvan considered that. The fireflies made grammar of the yard. \u201cMaybe the room has better manners than we do,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the room knows when a thing is too much to carry.\u201d\n\nColm smiled. \u201cThat is comforting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also a little sad. I prefer the version where something in the room grows teeth when I ask it to.\u201d He dropped the cigarette and squashed it with his toe and then, because he was himself, put the stub in the little tin June kept for that purpose as if he had been born knowing to respect tins.\n\nThey were quiet for a while. The quiet between them had become something new; it was not the silence of two boys in different corners of the same house, it was not the silence of two men who hadn\u2019t met each other properly yet. It was a silence that was a bridge under construction, ropes being thrown, a little sway, a little triumph at every knot.\n\nThe next day Tess made them do the show with everything but an audience. \u201cIt\u2019s called a dress rehearsal, though god forbid anyone wears anything nice,\u201d she said. She had a knack for making you feel like you were part of a tradition older than your birth and also brand-new. They put on the lights in the order he had memorized. He wrote a small prayer for himself in the margins of the cue sheet: \u201cStandby to not panic.\u201d He put his pen behind his ear and then reached for it and it wasn\u2019t there, and he laughed to himself because of Vee, because he had borrowed her habit and found it empty. At the half-hour he said \u201cHalf hour\u201d into a microphone that made his voice sound like a version of himself he could trust. The word traveled through hallways and stairwells and touched people he couldn\u2019t see. He thought of departure gates and the way certain words make bodies move. He thought of Magda\u2019s hand on his wrist and of the maintenance man\u2019s rag and of the ridiculous grace of a nose bleeding itself out. He stood in the booth and thought he might be almost fine. This was not a promise. It was a place to stand.\n\nThey ran. In Act One, Vee\u2019s scissors flashed, and the light caught an old nick on her knuckle that had scarred itself into a white comma. He wanted to ask what it had been; he wanted to say, \u201cMe too,\u201d even though his comma lived in a place the light had a hard time finding. In Act One, a prop glass rolled and showed its dirty bottom and Marcus kicked it softly toward its spike without looking and Evan loved him for that. In Act One, Tess said \u201cGo\u201d three beats later than he would have, and he learned something about patience he let creep into his bones.\n\nBetween Acts, a young man from the back of house brought in a tub of liquid with the caution of someone who had been given a baby and a bomb. \u201cBlood,\u201d he announced, because in theater you called a thing by its name so there would be no surprise later when it stained. The tub was cheap plastic and had a lid with a snap. The stuff inside was opaque maroon, too much chocolate syrup, a tug of corn. He had to test it, Tess said, because they would flick a finger into it in Act Two and paint a line on a cloth, a symbolic thing that would read as obvious if it were the wrong viscosity.\n\nHe looked at the tub the way you look at an ex you haven\u2019t seen since you were a worse person. He took a breath and opened the snap and let the smell meet his face. It smelled like midnights in kitchens, like pancakes at three a.m. It smelled like children. He found that the part of him that had braced for iron stood down except for the guards who were never off. He stirred with a paint stick and watched the surface pull and let go. Vee came to stand next to him and did not crowd him. She dipped her finger as if she were baptizing herself into mischief. She painted a line on the air, then wiped it on a cloth, and the cloth accepted it. \u201cLooks like a cartoon,\u201d she said. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because relief had that shape in him. \u201cI can do cartoons,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t like realism.\u201d She looked at him out of the corner of her eye as if testing whether he knew he had made a joke and taken some of the sting out of it.\n\n\u201cThanks for yesterday,\u201d Marcus said an hour later, passing him a coffee as if bribing him to be nice again. \u201cThat was\u2014 I hate it, you know, when my body decides to be stupid in public.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all hate that,\u201d Evan said, accepting the coffee and trying to like it as much as the kindness. He took a sip and grimaced because the cup thought it was coffee and was lying. Marcus laughed a little and patted his arm awkwardly and then went to find his hat, which he had mislaid again in the exact place Tess had told him not to.\n\nBy Friday, the day they would let a real roomful of strangers enter and turn them into an audience, the Evergreen had taken on that humming-jelly quality that theaters get when they are about to be genuine. The lobby had been mopped within an inch of its life and somehow still smelled like shoe. The bathrooms had been attended to with a brush and an ancient rag; Sophie had folded the paper towels into a triangle because she believed in small excellences even in rooms where no one cared. Tess walked around with a roll of gaff tape stuck to her wrist like a bracelet of authority. Evan put fresh batteries in mics and then put fresh batteries next to the fresh ones because he had learned that gods shriek without warning. He called the half and then the fifteen and then the five and each time the numbers felt realer, like going down in an airplane and seeing real houses.\n\nAt five, June and Arthur showed up in seats they had not paid for because Tess had growled that she would murder anyone who sold a comp to the mother of the new boy who saved a nose. June gooey-eyed the space as if it were the crib of a new baby and not a room that had held more ghosts than babies. Arthur sat as if he had never allowed a chair to tell him where to put his legs. Colm arrived two minutes before lights out, because he would never miss an entrance if someone would clap. He stood in the back at first, a habit, then took a seat when he realized someone else would take it. He had dressed in a sweater that women had probably knitted for him with their eyes. He watched Evan\u2019s booth like he could see through walls. When the lights went to half he became a shape in the dark that was in on a joke.\n\nThey started. The tiny edge of fear became a wave and then a lake and then a table he could set a drink on. He said \u201cStandby\u201d and they stood by. He said \u201cGo\u201d and the going happened. In the alley the night before he had told Colm he was a hinge; now he felt like a switch on the body of the theater, one of those small slick toggles with ridges meant for blind fingers. He listened to the audience laugh in a place where he had expected them to and not laugh where he had hoped they might; he listened to the intake of breath when the red fabric river happened, which was sound enough to pay everyone in the room for a week if they lived on breath. He did not mess up a single cue; that sentence was his and he took it home in his mouth and held it there for later when he would need something sweet.\n\nAfter the show the room did that sloppy slow-motion celebration theaters love: someone clapped too long in a sincere way that made someone else uncomfortable; a man hugged the wrong person; a woman cried and made it funny. Stranger faces came up the aisle and told Tess what the show had done to them, as if Tess were God and had to be told. June hugged three actors and told them she had seen their souls, which, coming from her, sounded like a thing she could actually do. Arthur found a chair and told it about a lighting cue he would have done differently because he could not help himself. Colm stood in a spot the light found and let it and did not apologize.\n\nEvan stood at the rail of the booth until his hands stopped wanting work. He looked at Vee, who was being congratulated by a woman with a jaw like judgment, and Vee endured it like someone who had decided not to be cut by certain knives anymore. He could feel in his pocket the slip of paper Tess had given him with three words on it, the first he had been paid in besides drink tickets: \u201cYou belong here.\u201d It was a trap and it was a gift and he had no idea how to unwrap it.\n\nOn the walk home with Colm through the soft-drunk summer streets, someone they didn\u2019t know stepped into their path and stepped back and then stepped in again, an indecision like a dance move invented by accident. He was a man of the kind Arthur called a \u201cpunctuation person\u201d\u2014someone who appeared in life like a comma and a question mark at once. He had the wiry look of a person who had never met a straight line. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re him,\u201d to Colm, and Colm\u2019s back did something small, a readiness, but his face stayed as open as a church door.\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Colm said. \u201cDepends on the hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a thing wants you,\u201d the man said. He looked at Evan too as if measuring his ability to be useful or to ruin something by breathing on it. He had a smell about him, sweat and night and old, old books.\n\n\u201cThere are always things,\u201d Colm said lightly, and the light in his voice was a screen door that would slam shut if you were not careful.\n\n\u201cThis one is related to your boy,\u201d the man said, and the way he said \u201cboy\u201d was older than the streetlights. \u201cYou know the river, the one with the rocks that racket like teeth. Something left a mark by the bridge. A red. A making. It isn\u2019t the usual paint. it isn\u2019t church. It\u2019s the other. They want you because you\u2019re small enough to ask and big enough to see. And if you don\u2019t, it keeps asking.\u201d\n\nEvan felt it as a cold at the base of his skull, not his blood thing, not his pilot thing either, a new tremor that belonged to his bones. He looked at Colm and saw that the warmth around him had turned from a summer thing to a cookfire. Colm laughed, a sound like a man being polite to a god who has just appeared in the wrong shirt. \u201cTell whoever \u2018they\u2019 are that I\u2019ll walk by the bridge after I tuck in the kid,\u201d he said, and he said \u201ckid\u201d and the man looked at Evan like he was a puzzle he did not want to solve.\n\n\u201cIf it spreads,\u201d the man said, \u201cand it will, you\u2019ll wish you went when asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone always does,\u201d Colm said softly. \u201cRun along. Drink water. Don\u2019t look straight at what the sky is doing tonight.\u201d\n\nThe man went; he didn\u2019t really go, he diminished until he was part of the block and then part of the block\u2019s memory. Evan stood and put his hands in his pockets because he hadn\u2019t known what else to do since he was thirteen. \u201cIs this your other work,\u201d he said, not keeping all the skepticism out of his voice, because if something was going to be nonsense he wanted to know before he had to clean up after it.\n\n\u201cIt is all the same work,\u201d Colm said, so tired in that moment that Evan wanted to put a blanket on his shoulders and tell him to sit. \u201cPeople misplace things. Dogs, rings, courage. Sometimes the things misplace themselves. Sometimes the road ruins the road and you have to ask it to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d Evan said, because his body had a reflex and it was to push away the idea that rooms pointed back.\n\n\u201cI am an instrument,\u201d Colm said, and for one sliver of a second his eyes did that molten trick and for one sliver of a second Evan knew what it would be to be a room that had just been asked. Then Colm\u2019s face closed again, and he was only a man in a sweater. \u201cCome if you want. Stay if you\u2019re saner than me.\u201d\n\nEvan wanted, which surprised him. He wanted to stand by a river and see whether the water could talk. He wanted to be with his brother even if his brother was about to walk into a nonsense he had made up to survive himself. He also wanted to go to bed and make himself a small person under a quilt in a house where June left lights on like wards. He was two men and a boy and a hinge and a switch and a person who wanted to be bored. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll walk,\u201d and heard how his voice made it sound like a fact.\n\nThey went down past the storefronts with their names like herbs and apothecaries, past the bar where Max sometimes sat on his one night off and pretended not to be dispatch. The night had a bruise in it. The river announced itself before they could see it; it had a mouth the town had taught it to use. When they got to the bridge, a municipal thing that had dipped its toes in history and then been replaced and then dipped again, Evan felt the hairs on his arms decide they had been painted on. He saw, under the bright mean light, a mark. It was at the place where teenagers wrote their names and then pretended it was their fates. It looked like paint in that it was red, but not the red you buy at Lowe\u2019s because it matches your idea of barn. It had that weird blue in it that real red has. It was also dry and also looked wet. It had been spread with a hand by someone who had never spread paint before on purpose.\n\nColm stepped closer and then stopped with respect like you stop at the edge of a sanctuary when you don\u2019t know where the candles are. He did not put his hand out. Good, Evan thought, because if you touch the stupid thing I will have to carry you home and explain to June that you died of idiot. The cord in the back of Colm\u2019s hand stood up anyway, like it wanted to try the dark. \u201cSomeone made a door,\u201d Colm said, and he said it matter-of-fact the way you might say \u201cThe soffit is rotten.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to close doors. They\u2019ll say they didn\u2019t mean it and then act hurt when the wind comes in.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to get you a rag,\u201d Evan said, a blend of mockery and care that had been their pattern since the first time they had shared a bathroom. \u201cYou want me to pretend this is paint and you want to scrape.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to stand where you\u2019re standing,\u201d Colm said, and the voice\u2014there it was\u2014thickened, gained a grain. \u201cYou make rooms steady. It helps.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lunatic,\u201d Evan said, with love, and took half a step anyway into the posture of a man who has decided he can catch something if it falls. He looked at the mark and hated it for looking like a hand he had seen on glass. He could feel a pulse under the bridge in the water or in himself; he could not tell which and laughed quietly because distinction is for days off.\n\nColm took a breath, big and slow. He reached into his pocket and brought out not a rag but a stub of chalk like a teacher who doesn\u2019t want to teach your child so much as draw a protective circle around her. He drew on the concrete next to the red without touching it. He drew a shape that was humble, a circle with a little dent in it, like a cup under a drip. He muttered, and Evan realized with a shock that he had heard the words before. They were a child\u2019s nonsense about not letting the bogeyman under the bed: \u201cStay out, stay there, stay in your house.\u201d He had said it when he was eight while June brushed his hair and he had asked about his father. How did Colm know it. How did Colm have a piece of their kitchen in his mouth.\n\nThe chalk line wasn\u2019t much. It was already smeared from the damp that lived under a bridge. But when Colm finished the little circle and put the chalk back in his pocket and exhaled, some awful pressure in the air gave up its little show of power and went off to find a lazier boy to bother. The red looking-wet looked less wet, because the world had decided not to stare at it. The river made a little satisfied sound, as if a pebble had been moved to a better place.\n\n\u201cYou and your toys,\u201d Evan said, the words as a way to not say what he had felt.\n\n\u201cYou and your buttons,\u201d Colm said back, smiling that crooked his good teeth could not fix.\n\nThey walked home without speaking about it. Near the house, the dog from the previous night crossed in front of them and bowed again, as if it had taken the night class and learned to greet kings. Evan wanted to apologize to the animal for all the people he had been and not been. He wanted to say to the world, I am trying. June had left the porch light on. It made a small pool on the boards. He stepped into that pool and felt, for the second time in as many days, that his body belonged to him in a way that might last for the space of a cup of tea.\n\nIn bed, with the window cracked and the Ohio summer wanting in, he did not dream of birds or of red or of chalk. He dreamed of a switch, the old kind with a Bakelite knob, ridged under his thumb. He dreamed that the switch was part of a machine he could not see all of and that somehow, impossibly, when he pressed it, two rooms lit at once: the theater and the cockpit, one light warmer than the other, both good. In the morning he would wake and make coffee and be someone who went to work; not the work everyone expected, not the work he had thought would always be the only thing for him, but work nonetheless. He would measure his day in standbys and gos, in breath and in chalk, in the ordinary acquaintance of people who did not expect to find god but were not insulted when a small god found them anyway. He would walk into the Evergreen and be the man who made the dark happen on purpose and then bring it up, who let a story come and put its hand out and not flinch when it did. He would, because he had no other way, listen for the change.",

                              "content": "By morning the bridge felt like an idea he could have dreamed, the way small dangerous things do when you place a window between them and the sun. June put eggs on a plate like she always had and told him a story about a neighbor who had planted zinnias in a circle so tight the flowers were suffocating each other and how she\u2019d walked over with a spoon and separated them gently as if they were toddlers, and Arthur argued with the weather on television as if its predictions were personal slurs. Colm looked the same and not the same, the warmth around him banked but insistent, and he picked up his coffee with both hands the way he did when something had tugged at his edges in the night. Evan let the ordinary make its case, nodded when June told him to take a banana because potassium was not optional, and pretended not to watch his brother for signs of anything a language didn\u2019t have words for yet.\n\nHe walked to the theater alone because he wanted to see the town in daylight after standing under its bridge at midnight, and because it felt like a dare he could win without anyone witnessing the wobble in his step. The baristas at the corner place were children with rings in places his grandmother would have called delicate; one of them had a bandage at his knuckle and the sight of the dirty gauze made Evan\u2019s throat dip and rise like a fish. He bought coffee and did not look at the drip on the lid that made a small Rosetta of brown on the white; he wiped it with his sleeve and told himself that whatever ritual that was, it was his to choose. Inside the Evergreen Tess had a roll of tickets around her wrist and a pen behind her ear and the aura of a woman about to commit to a battle that would end in confetti and bills, and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re early in a way that makes me think you slept badly, which is fine, I slept like an ambassador between two warring states.\u201d\n\nThey walked the building together the way pilots walk a plane, touching things not because touch changes them but because touch tells you when change has already happened. Tess bent and ran her fingers along the edge of the stage and came up with a splinter that she kissed and put on her tongue because that was the sort of superstition that was half a laugh and half a sacrament. Evan checked the light board and the sound levels and the prop cabinet that wanted to be a closet someday and found his own handwriting where Tess had made him make it yesterday, his capital letters more certain than he felt. Vee arrived with wet hair and a book under her arm that said \u201cBirds of Ohio\u201d as if words could domesticate their subjects, and when she saw him she nodded without flourishes and said, \u201cYou all right,\u201d in a tone that made it easy to tell the truth.\n\n\u201cI am a man held together by tape,\u201d he said, and she smiled without breaking stride and said, \u201cThen we\u2019re all spiritual cousins,\u201d and disappeared to argue with a costume that had decided to be silk when it had been bought as cotton. The smallness of the day steadied him, a list he could put into his mouth and swallow without choking. He said \u201cHalf hour\u201d into the microphone and liked the power of it; he said \u201cFifteen\u201d and tried not to think of gates and boarding groups; he said \u201cFive\u201d and felt his heart settle into a tempo that had nothing to do with engines and everything to do with intention.\n\nThe second night brought different strangers, and strangers are always different in their sameness. A woman in the third row wore a cardigan like armor and let herself cry when the red fabric moved as if her body had been waiting for permission; an older man laughed at a line about grandmothers as if laughter were a rebellion he could still afford. Evan took them in as a single creature with a hundred heads, an animal that needed to be led to water and told it was allowed to drink. He fumbled a sound cue by a breath and nobody died; Tess squeezed his shoulder afterward as if to reward him for being human in public. He felt the familiar urge to apologize for an error he\u2019d trained entire systems out of, and he stepped on it like a lit match and let it smoke and be nothing.\n\nAfter the show they stood in the green room that wasn\u2019t, a rectangle with a microwave that had gone to college twice and a couch that had acquired a reputation. Marcus handed around grapes as if he were Santa reinvented as a fruit bowl and Vee ate them with a precision that made you think she had rules about spheres. Tess counted the cash in the donation jar with her lips moving and said something rude about the generosity of people who would spend fifteen dollars on a drink and bring her three in crumpled bills, but she said it with love, like a mother scolding a thief who steals for reasons she understands. Evan sat on a flight case and let the buzz run out of him the way carbonation does when you let a bottle breathe, and when he looked up he saw that Colm was in the doorway again as if the building had asked him to be one of its doorframes.\n\n\u201cGood house,\u201d Colm said to Tess, and Tess snorted and said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen worse and I\u2019ve seen it with mildew,\u201d and then she turned to Evan and said, \u201cYour voice for the \u2018Standby\u2019 is getting lower, which makes everyone calm, so keep drinking coffee or whatever makes you less of a boy, but not so much that you start thinking you\u2019re in charge of anything.\u201d Evan said, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d and Vee said, \u201cHe\u2019s an agreeable hinge,\u201d and the word made him grin in a way that felt like a borrowed coat that fit better than expected.\n\nThey walked out into the alley under a sky that was doing that thing Ohio skies do where they look like they\u2019ve been ironed by someone who resented the chore. The news vans had gone to cover something that wasn\u2019t art, and the dumpsters smelled like bread and ghosts; someone had painted over a tag on the brick with a patch of color that didn\u2019t match, and now the color was the tag. Colm looked thinner in the sodium light, the warmth of him drawn tight to save heat, and he said, \u201cBridge is quiet,\u201d before Evan could ask, and then he said, \u201cIt won\u2019t stay. But you have your show, so we will let polite things be polite and impolite things be less interesting for as long as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it when it isn\u2019t a mark,\u201d Evan asked, because his skepticism had the odd habit of turning into curiosity when he wasn\u2019t looking. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a door, I mean. What is it a door to.\u201d\n\n\u201cDepends who drew it and who made the first noise,\u201d Colm said, as if he were explaining traffic patterns. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a door to someone else\u2019s breath. Sometimes it\u2019s a door to the part of the town that doesn\u2019t like us. Sometimes it\u2019s nothing and I am a fool with chalk, which is my preferred diagnosis. Do your hands shake when you press \u2018Go\u2019 or are you a statue yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a statue someone put a motor in,\u201d Evan said, and Colm laughed, not because it was funny but because it was precise, and then he told Evan about a woman who had hired him to find her locket and had ended up finding her own patience instead, and the story ended with a cat that had adopted a plant and made it thrive. They stood in that spill of light that pretended to be safety and listened to the traffic two streets over argue with itself, and neither of them said the word blood because they didn\u2019t need to.\n\nThe next morning, Arthur found a notice on the neighborhood forum printed out by a neighbor who believed paper to be more real than screens, and he brought it to the table with the air of a man delivering a summons. The flier had a photo of a stencil on a brick wall, not the bridge exactly but the same hand, the same insistence on red, the line of a palm and the suggestion of fingers like a schoolchild\u2019s turkey drawing. The caption said, \u201cVandalism or art? Join the conversation,\u201d and there was a time and a place and the earnestness of people who want all problems to be solvable by chairs arranged in a circle. June clicked her tongue and said, \u201cIf they get me in a circle I\u2019ll stand up, you know I will,\u201d and Arthur said, \u201cThey will hate you for speaking plain,\u201d and June said, \u201cThey always do; I\u2019ll bring cookies.\u201d\n\nEvan looked at the picture and felt the same cartoon slide in his stomach he had felt at the bridge, smaller in daylight but there. Colm took the paper and looked at it long enough for the coffee to go cold and said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d like a judge pronouncing guilt with compassion. \u201cMost people who make doors don\u2019t intend to. They mean to hang a picture and they open the wall instead.\u201d He folded the paper neatly so the red hand was hidden and put it in his jacket pocket and said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll go to that conversation, don\u2019t you, June,\u201d and June gave him a look that combined all the ways she had of loving him and said, \u201cWe do not let the babies talk by themselves.\u201d\n\nTess hated meetings because meetings were two steps away from grants, and grants made her stomach acid perform acrobatics for audiences, but she went to this one because the theater had a stake in any red thing in this town. She wore a shirt that said \u201cGaffer Tape Is My Love Language,\u201d and when someone made a joke about it she let them and then talked about the cost of replacing bulbs in the work lights and everyone in the room watched her like they would buy her a bulb and a steak if they could. The gathering was held in a church basement that had learned to smell like coffee regardless of who was drinking it, and the chairs had been arranged in a circle that wanted to be a net. Vee came and took notes on a piece of paper she would later lose; Marcus brought the hat as if he thought it could serve as a talking stick; Sophie threaded a needle and did not comment. Evan sat near the back with Colm because he wanted to see who turned their heads when someone said \u201cdoor.\u201d\n\nThe town showed up like a family asked to discuss a will: eager, anxious, pretending they weren\u2019t thinking about what they\u2019d get to take home. A teacher spoke about art as provocation and her students who wanted to be seen and hadn\u2019t been; a man from the city muttered about property values and vandalism and hinted at fines like a magician forcing a card; a woman who worked at the pharmacy told a story about a boy who had come in with paint on his fingers and had asked for tape and gauze and had flinched when the automatic doors opened. June said, \u201cMaybe you make a person less lonely and they won\u2019t need to make the wall less lonely,\u201d and Arthur said, \u201cOr maybe you do both because people are complicated,\u201d and someone clapped and then apologized for clapping because the room had not signed a contract about applause.\n\nWhen it was Colm\u2019s turn\u2014or rather, when he made it his turn by standing and making the room admit he was tall\u2014he spoke in that voice of his that widened the aisles. He said, \u201cMaybe treat the walls like people, too. Maybe tell them you see them. Paint the thing you want to look at when you head home, and if it isn\u2019t a hand, all right. If it is, ask whose hand. Ask what it thinks it\u2019s reaching for.\u201d He didn\u2019t say the word door. He didn\u2019t say the words stay out or stay there or stay in your house. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t make a mark you can\u2019t clean,\u201d and the room took the sentence into itself like bread.\n\nA boy in the second row who had cut his hair to look like he had not tried spoke, his voice an apology and a dare. He said, \u201cIt was me,\u201d though no one had asked the question that bluntly, and the teachers in the room put their hands in their laps and decided not to rush forward to claim him. He said, \u201cI thought it would make a hole people could put their eyes in,\u201d and everyone except Evan heard this and thought he meant attention, and Evan heard this and thought he meant exactly what he said. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know it would smell,\u201d and at that word something in Evan\u2019s back teeth ached with the memory of rocket fuel that wasn\u2019t, with pennies that weren\u2019t, with the sweetness that had first made his heart bolt.\n\nAfter the meeting, which adjourned because the coffee ran out and the room had had its say, Evan walked with the boy out into the small social weather of the parking lot. Colm followed at a distance because he could be generous like that when it mattered. The boy picked at his thumb cuticle like it was responsible, and Evan recognized the age of the movement; he had been that age with wheels in his head and only one road inviting him. \u201cYou opened something you didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d Evan said, so even the boy could not misunderstand. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be careful now. You\u2019re going to clean what you can. You\u2019re going to draw things you can take back.\u201d\n\nThe boy looked at him like he had been told by a stranger that he had a father somewhere and that the father was neither hero nor villain but a man who knew how to tighten a bolt. \u201cDo you know how,\u201d he said, the vulnerable nakedness of the question making itself an animal between them. \u201cDo you know how to take back.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Evan said, and felt the shame of the sometimes like a perfume he didn\u2019t want and couldn\u2019t wash off. \u201cI know someone who knows. He\u2019s annoying and he\u2019s kind and he thinks chalk is a religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cChalk is for teachers,\u201d the boy said, bravado injecting itself like sugar, and Evan laughed and said, \u201cExactly,\u201d and he saw the boy picture a room with a blackboard and calm, and he saw the way that image tightened the strings in his neck and loosened others. Colm drifted close then, as if he had been invited by an invisible hands-clasp, and he said to the boy, \u201cCome by the Evergreen after five if you can stand the smell of sawdust married to ancient coffee. We\u2019ll show you where the doors are supposed to be.\u201d\n\nThe day after that the thing came inside, which was inevitable because everything loves an audience. It did not knock on the literal door or throw itself at the box office or demand a ticket; it came in on someone\u2019s shoes and someone else\u2019s breath and the idea that had been shaped at a bridge and a brick and a flier. It showed up as a pattern first, a series of small red thumbprints on the edge of a prop table, nothing grotesque, just the quiet residue of a hundred handled motions coalescing into an iris. Sophie made a noise in her throat and reached for a wipe; Tess said, \u201cNot yet,\u201d and Evan put his hand on the table and felt, absurdly, a faint pulse, as if the wood were reciting something it had just learned.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stop the rehearsal; he would not have dared, and besides, it would have been the wrong spell. He let the run go on and did his job and pressed \u201cGo\u201d and \u201cStop\u201d when asked and carried water to a person who had decided they never needed water and was wrong. At break he stood by the table with the red freckles and said, \u201cHold,\u201d not for the room, but to the idea that wanted to become larger. He said it softly and then said, \u201cStay,\u201d under his breath the way you say it to a dog in a shape you hope the dog likes. He found Sheila\u2019s old chalk in the drawer with her cough drops and a button shaped like a cat, and he drew the little cup shape next to the furthest smear and then another near the next. He did not draw circles around anything; he did not imprison. He drew places for things to go when they were tired of being mischief.\n\nVee watched him and said, \u201cWe let you play with the holy markers now,\u201d and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell Tess or she\u2019ll charge me a rental fee,\u201d and Vee said, \u201cShe\u2019ll charge you and then take you to lunch.\u201d She reached out without touching the chalk lines and said, \u201cWhat is it that you and your brother do when you\u2019re not selling tickets to stories,\u201d and he said, \u201cWe ask rooms to behave,\u201d and she nodded as if she had been doing that all her life with her face and her hands and had been waiting for a name for it.\n\nThe boy from the meeting\u2014Noah, as soon as he said it it made sense, because he had a float to him, an ark quality, something that moved even when still\u2014showed up that afternoon wearing a shirt with paint on it placed like punctuation. He stood at the edge of the stage like someone waiting to be picked last and first, and Tess, who saw everyone before they showed up, looked at him and said, \u201cYou\u2019re late if you\u2019re early, that\u2019s how this works,\u201d and handed him a broom like a knighthood. He swept with fervor, then with rhythm, then with the calm of a person who had been given a repeatable action and was not going to let it go. When he saw the chalk cups he asked, \u201cDo I draw one,\u201d and Evan said, \u201cIf you ever draw one do it slow and small and say something nice while you\u2019re doing it,\u201d and Noah said, \u201cLike what,\u201d and Vee, walking by with a pair of scissors in her back pocket as if they\u2019d grown there, said, \u201cLike \u2018I forgive you,\u2019\u201d and Noah took that word as if it were water.\n\nThat night, halfway through Act Two, the red fabric river did a new thing; it snagged on a splinter in the table no one had seen and would have torn if Marcus hadn\u2019t moved his hand like a man who has once broken something sacred and vowed never to again. The audience did not know; they only heard the intake of breath from six onstage lungs and the little \u201ctsk\u201d from Sophie in the wings, and then they saw the river run, smooth as a long apology. Evan, from the booth, watched the near-ruin and had a thought he didn\u2019t care for, that the show wanted to be something and would try with or without him, and then he had the better thought that his small interventions mattered because they made beauty possible instead of merely lucky. He pressed \u201cGo\u201d and felt his finger like a vote.\n\nAfter, when the room had emptied of its borrowed heartbeats and the lobby smelled like damp coats and gratitude, Tess sent everyone home except him and Colm, which felt like being kept after school by a teacher who wants to ask you about your mother. She went to the prop table and placed her hands flat on either side of the red freckles and closed her eyes like a person listening for a train. \u201cIt\u2019s quieter,\u201d she said after a while, and then she looked at the chalk cups and added, \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t see you dipping into the pantry without asking. If you make a mess you clean it.\u201d\n\nColm grinned with his mouth closed like a boy, and Tess rolled her eyes and said, \u201cYou two are going to give me a heart attack and then you\u2019ll add me to the lighting plot as if a ghost weren\u2019t a nuisance,\u201d and then she put her hand on Evan\u2019s head briefly, the way Magda had done without the history, the way June had done with all of it. \u201cYou\u2019re learning a new kind of flight,\u201d she said, brisk so he wouldn\u2019t get ideas, and then she was gone, the door swinging with her authority for a full minute.\n\nThe next day rain came in a uniform sheet like the town had ordered it from a catalog and was now obligated by return policy to keep it. The bridge swelled its sound to be heard over the regular shush, and the chalk at the pillar dissolved into scripts the water understood better than they did. Evan went with Colm anyway because there are rituals that call you even when they have been half-undone by weather, and they stood under the lip of concrete and listened to the sound of the river correcting itself. The red mark from two nights ago had been painted over by someone efficient, a gray bandaid on a bruise, and the new gray had already learned to be damp in a particular way. Colm did not draw anything. He stood and put his hand in his pocket and brought out nothing but lint, and he smiled at the river and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me if you\u2019re unhappy,\u201d and the river said what rivers say, which is Yes and No and Always and Never, a grammar of contradictions that nonetheless holds boats.\n\nOn Sunday June made a roast that had never met an animal, and Arthur pretended to carve it with ceremony and then passed plates like a man at a communion rail. They ate and did not talk about bridges or doors. They talked about a neighbor whose child had shaved his head for charity and about a man at the hardware store who had given June a discount as if she were a story he wanted to be in. Colm told them a tame version of an evening that had ended with him walking a drunk home and putting her on her own couch like a coat and leaving a glass of water on the piano where she\u2019d see it. Evan told them that the hat had disappeared and been found on the hat rack as if it had finally decided to follow its own instructions. They were a family for a whole hour, with repetitions and interruptions and the knowledge that the week would rip them into their separate costumes again.\n\nIn the night, because nights will, it came back and tried another room. Not the bridge, not the theater, not the church basement with its coffee-stained democracy. It came to the bus that city workers parked behind the library, a long yellow animal that dozed on its own fumes. The driver arrived before dawn for one of those routes only birds and insomniacs notice and found a smear on the glass over the emergency exit in the back, a handprint incomplete and too small, the sort of mark that makes you think of children first and then of hands that don\u2019t belong to children anymore. He called someone because he was a good man; the someone he called called someone else because that is how towns function; and the someone else who answered was Colm, because of course, and because the town had learned a number that woke him.\n\nThey went together in the gray butter of early morning, Evan and Colm, the streetlights not yet convinced there would be a day. The bus stood in its place like an animal chained to a post that only it could see. The mark looked almost pink in that light, absurdly sweet, and that made the back of Evan\u2019s teeth ache more than red ever would. He walked around the bus with a hand out the way you walk around a sleeping horse and spoke to it without words because you do that when a thing is large and could harm you without malice. Colm climbed the stairs and stood in the aisle and put his hand on a seat, and the bus accepted his touch like metal does, all or nothing.\n\n\u201cDo you hear it,\u201d Colm said, and Evan wanted to answer No on principle, but the truth was a small humiliating Yes because the idea had entered him and would not be evicted. It was not a sound, not exactly. It was a held note. It was a breath with nowhere to go. It was a plane in a holding pattern, circling, waiting for fog to lift. It was the hand he had seen on the windshield turned into intention and trapped. He looked at the emergency exit and saw how it would be to try to push it and find that there were rules about which way doors open, rules the door refused to explain.\n\nColm did not draw chalk because chalk is nothing on glass. He took the roll of tape from his pocket\u2014gaff, not painter\u2019s, because some materials carry their own gravity\u2014and tore it into a small square and then another and another, and he made a cross of tape on the emergency exit release, a child\u2019s salute to seriousness. \u201cThis is stupid,\u201d Evan said, and Colm said, \u201cYes,\u201d and then he said, \u201cSometimes stupid is a language a room understands,\u201d and then he breathed on the glass to fog it like a magician refusing to be a liar and placed his hand flat over the small hand that had been there, and Evan saw for a second the ridiculous and unbearable tenderness of a man trying to tell glass not to be cruel.\n\nThey stood there too long for men who had jobs, and then they left because theater and hardware and the day insisted. In the booth, later, Evan said \u201cStandby\u201d with a voice that was more bass than it had been a week ago, and he saw that Vee had wrapped her fingers with tape without bleeding to earn it, and he watched Noah sweep as if a broom could erase history and replace it with a very clean floor. In a lull between scenes, Tess said from the back of the house, \u201cWe will do another piece in the fall,\u201d as if announcing a weather pattern, \u201cone about places that misbehave,\u201d and everyone groaned because devising a piece is a small war, and then everyone nodded because there is nothing worse than being safe.\n\nThat night a man who had never set foot in a theater came and sat in the back and watched as if his life depended on it because maybe it did; afterward he came up the aisle and stood near the booth and raised a hand like someone asking a question in school. He said to Evan, \u201cI used to fly,\u201d and Evan had the urge to salute him without knowing from what or to what, and he said, \u201cI am temporarily grounded,\u201d and the man said, \u201cAren\u2019t we all,\u201d and then he laughed the laugh of men who have watched clouds from the wrong side and left while the lobby still felt like a lung.\n\nEvan lay in bed later and looked at the ceiling that he knew intimately, every hairline crack like a line on a map he could trace with his finger when he couldn\u2019t sleep. The house made its sounds, the small pings and groans that mean a structure is remembering what it is to be held up. He thought of chalk and tape and cup shapes and red fabric and doors with rules and bridges and buses. He thought of hands on glass and hands on levers and the way a stage breathes when the lights go out. He imagined, not fancifully but in the manner of a person making a list before a trip, a set of instructions for being a person that he could live with: drink water, stand where asked, draw small circles that mean welcome, say Hold when you have to, say Go when you must, keep your hand on the switch and do not flinch when the light comes.\n\nIn the morning the sun did its plain yellow work on the brick of the theater and the pillar of the bridge and the paintboard in the boy\u2019s hand. The town stretched and decided again to be a town. There were donuts at the firehouse and dogs nosing at grass and old men standing with hands behind their backs conducting invisible orchestras. Colm came to the kitchen with a newspaper he didn\u2019t read and a look he couldn\u2019t help and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a woman who lost a ring near the river and thinks she wants it,\u201d and June said, \u201cTell her to come get a bracelet instead; I have a tin of them,\u201d and Arthur said, \u201cHe will, and he will take her to see the bridge and not give her the ring when he finds it because it is the wrong ring,\u201d and Colm said, \u201cCorrect,\u201d and then looked at Evan like a man looking at a weather vane he had relied upon for years and asked, \u201cYou on headset,\u201d and Evan nodded and said, \u201cI am,\u201d and that was both an answer and a vow.",

                              "content": "On the seventh morning since he put his bag down in the front hall and let June call it staying, the town woke smelling like cut grass and wet newspaper, and Colm said, \u201cThe ring woman is real and she is outside your mother\u2019s house because the world is small when it wants to be.\u201d He said it while standing at the sink drinking water like a man who has been reminded how mortal a throat is. June wiped her hands on a towel and arranged her mouth into the shape that meant she would approve of anyone who asked for help if they did it without superiority. Arthur made a noise that could have been skepticism or exactly the opposite, and Evan looked out the front window because he knew his part, which was always to look first and decide second.\n\nShe was there on the walk under the maple that always made more shade than made sense, a woman in a dress that tried hard not to be new and a cardigan with those satin ribbons at the neck that you never use. Her hair was pulled back the way nurses wear it in hospitals and actors on stage when they play nurses, and her eyes were the eyes of someone who had moved between aisles for too long, the grocery, the drugstore, the church, carrying lists like they were oaths. She held her hand at her sternum like something there needed holding. When June opened the door, the woman turned that held hand into a wave and then into a brace for the other hand, which had, Evan saw, a small band of nakedness where something had been.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to come without phoning,\u201d she said, and Evan wondered if she had ever in her life done anything without apologizing first to air and to doorways. \u201cI am Elaine. I\u2014 Colm helped my neighbor with her furnace, and someone put my name on a scrap of paper that ended up in his pocket and now here we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe like scraps,\u201d June said, ushering her into the house with a softness that had saved many a ragged person from thinking they were ragged. \u201cWe keep them in boxes and pretend we\u2019ll make quilts. Sit. We\u2019ll put coffee in you and if you want to talk about a ring I will not let Arthur get righteous about how things are lost on purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am righteous about very few things,\u201d Arthur said, and then proved himself a liar by handing Elaine a cup of coffee as if he were conducting a ceremony. \u201cTell us where the river took it.\u201d\n\nElaine smiled at that, small but real. \u201cBy the little bridge where the rocks sound like they\u2019re making fun of you,\u201d she said. \u201cI was there after my shift because the sound was a way to not think. I took off my ring to put lotion on because my hands\u2014 well.\u201d She held them out and they were hands that had been dry and scrubbed and wet and scrubbed and dry, the skin like paper that\u2019s seen the rain and been ironed and seen the rain again. \u201cI put it in my pocket and then I did not put it back on, and when I got home I had lotion and no ring and I retraced steps and I used my phone like a flashlight though that is not what it is and I went back in the morning and then it rained and now I am here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDescribe it,\u201d Colm said, not impatient, just saving the room time later when the light would be different. \u201cNot the metals, the feeling.\u201d\n\nShe blinked at him and then did the tiny nod he always valued in people, the one that meant they could take a sideways question and answer it straight. \u201cIt fits,\u201d she said, and then laughed at herself for the simplicity. \u201cIt was my mother\u2019s and it fits. It isn\u2019t more precious than that and it is. It has a chip you only see when you tilt it. It did not cost anything to anyone who keeps records.\u201d\n\nJune said, \u201cI have a tin of bracelets,\u201d reflex because she couldn\u2019t help offering substitutes, and Elaine smiled like someone being handed a coat while she stands in a dress she has promised to wear because it was bought for her.\n\nThey went because that is what you do when there is a ring and a river and a woman who has made herself small to come and ask. The road at that hour was indifferent to drama. The man who sprayed for weeds was dressed like a ghost of municipal business. High school kids pretending to jog practiced a choreography of disdain and hunger. The bridge looked like it always did, which is part of why it\u2019s dangerous; you forget how many feet have crossed it wanting different things. The river whispered its long gossip.\n\nElaine stood with her hands at her sides like a child and said, \u201cI stood here,\u201d and you could see it, the spot stamped with her trying. Colm went down the bank like a man who knows how to use his ankle bones and who knows the result of not knowing. Evan followed and hated the way the damp tested the rubber edge of his shoe. He could feel his throat prepare a speech about iron and pennies and slurred sweetness and he stopped the speech with a different voice, his own low. He said, for himself, \u201cStandby,\u201d because it was ridiculous and also worked.\n\nColm didn\u2019t bring chalk because chalk is silly here. He brought a magnet on a string which was sillier and which worked, sometimes. He dropped it in the shallow and pulled up bottle caps like coins from a fairy story that doesn\u2019t pay well, then he went further down where the river made that anxious murmur at the culvert and tossed in the magnet where the current was a little greedy. \u201cIt has a chip,\u201d he said, remembering, though the magnet didn\u2019t care about chips. Evan watched the water over his foot flatten and fatten, flatten and fatten, like a breath he could pace. He could smell iron because he had brought iron odor with him in his head; the river only smelled like river.\n\n\u201cI can go in,\u201d he heard himself say, surprising himself and the part of him that would have gone anywhere but in. He took off his shoes, which made June\u2019s voice rise up in his brain with a warning about hooks and glass, and stepped into Ohio in June. The water went to his calves and then to his knees, and there was that quick ache you get and then the animal part of you adjusts and calls it fine. He moved his feet along like he was dancing with the bottom because putting them down hard would be stupid, and he put his hand in and the water looked at his hand like a cat looks at a stranger, dubious and finely attentive.\n\nHe found nothing but stone at first, nothing but the cold that has less to do with temperature and more to do with wear. He then found a thing that wasn\u2019t stone, a small oval of glass from a bottle that had been memorized by the current until it forgot it had started life as a handle for liquor. He picked it up and thought how easy it is to mistake histories that have been polished long enough. He moved a little deeper and felt a slick of algae that told him he should not move that way again, and then he felt a thing that was a circle, and his breath did the wrong thing because circles and rings and throats are cousins. He closed his hand not around it but beside it and then coaxed, as if the object were a shy friend of a friend at a party. The ring slid against his skin and attempted to go back to the river because everything tries to go back if you let it, and he said out loud, foolish, \u201cHold,\u201d and the ring rested against his fingers like a bird that pretends it chose you.\n\nWhen he came up out of the water he had a small piece of metal and a trembling he did not hate. It was not gold. It was a crooked hoop of something that had been plated and then had surrendered. It was not Elaine\u2019s. It was a ring the river had made from something else the river had eaten. He held it up and Elaine shook her head and smiled anyway.\n\n\u201cI will keep that one if you don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the day. And for the story that goes with the day. If mine is still there it is wanted where it is. If it isn\u2019t, I\u2019ll find out I can live without it.\u201d\n\nColm bent his head and looked into the water like a man reading a book he suspects is lying. He walked a little and sat on his haunches and looked weirdly priestly doing it. He didn\u2019t draw anything, not even with a stick, which made Evan feel better because drawing cups on river rock would have made him want to leave. He put his hand on a stone and then lifted his palm and there was a line of red under his skin that hadn\u2019t been there before, the sort of line that might alarm someone who hadn\u2019t been living inside metaphor for a week. Evan flinched and then did not, because the line was under, not on. He made his breath change shape. He looked at Elaine\u2019s hands, at the way they had learned to be steady from being demanded of, and he thought of the fake blood in the tub and the way it had accepted a finger and been silly. He thought of the nosebleed and of pressing a compress with the back of his hand so he didn\u2019t have to look straight at the thing his brain had decided to name. He thought of the math of small kindnesses and saw how it totaled larger than most catastrophes.\n\nOn the way back to the house Elaine sat in the back seat and spoke to the ring that was not hers like people speak to a plant they have stuck in the sun to see if it wants to live. She said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be a story,\u201d and the ring did not argue because it had no mouth. At the corner a boy on a skateboard did a shape with his board that looked like grammar failing and then recovering, and Evan laughed without thinking, which is always the better kind of laugh.\n\nAt the theater Tess handed him a new set of responsibilities as if she had ordered them from a catalog and they had arrived in a box slightly crushed. \u201cWe have a matinee for a school that believes it is doing a good thing for their children which is how they make sure the parents keep paying them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be loud in the ways quiet people do loudness. The questions afterward will be awful and revealing. You will announce \u2018Please turn off your devices\u2019 and be listened to by none. Also, our dimmers have a cough; if they do that cough during the red fabric sequence, you will lie to them and say we mean it. You will be very convincing.\u201d\n\nHe went into the booth and sat for a minute without touching anything because he had learned you can\u2019t put your hands on every tool you love every hour; you have to let them be furniture half the day. The school filed in like a creature with many sneakers. The teacher voices made layers, sweet and authoritarian, and the building adjusted itself to hold their amount of expectation. He said, into a mic that made everyone sound like a radio they trusted, \u201cPlease turn off anything that will ring,\u201d and half a dozen children put phones deeper into pockets like burying mice. Vee came up the stairs with a paper cup and set it by his right hand without looking at him because sometimes that is how kindness behaves. \u201cSip,\u201d she said, and then, \u201cIf they ask you anything in the Q&A don\u2019t tell them there\u2019s fake blood in a tub because then we will have to mop questions instead of floors.\u201d\n\nHe did the show and it came like it should, with a bump at the place where the projector had been sulking, and he pushed past it with his thumb like a man refusing to listen to a sulking friend. The children made a noise he liked when the red fabric moved, the combination of \u201cOh,\u201d and \u201cI could do that,\u201d and \u201cIt had not occurred to me to desire this until this second,\u201d which was essentially the reason to open any door. After, when the lights came to half and the children were given permission to make theater about themselves, a boy raised his hand and did not wait to be called on and asked, \u201cIs it scary when it\u2019s dark in here and you are the only one who knows where the lights are,\u201d and Evan said into the mic, \u201cOnly in the way being in charge of a light switch is scary,\u201d and the children laughed and then a girl in the back raised her hand very formally and asked, \u201cWhat do you do if you make a mistake,\u201d and he wanted to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d but his mouth, which was learning to be honest in public, said, \u201cYou forgive yourself quickly so you can stop making it,\u201d and the kids made that humming sound children make when they are deciding whether to let a sentence into their private arsenal.\n\nHis phone buzzed as the kids left, and he thought, Max, because Max had a knack for buzzing him when he was between tasks, but it was Fischer, the beard man who liked maps and had a picture of a Cessna like a diploma in his office. He stepped into the hallway where the emergency light made everyone look like a rehearsal version of themselves. \u201cHow\u2019s your leave, Marlowe,\u201d Fischer said, which could be anything from \u201cAre you stealing the pens,\u201d to \u201cAre you dying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a list,\u201d Evan said, because that was as accurate as anything. \u201cI have a job where I say \u2018Standby\u2019 and \u2018Go\u2019 and \u2018Hold\u2019 but no one dies if I say them wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recommend it to everyone,\u201d Fischer said, and his tone made you suspect he meant it. \u201cI\u2019m checking because we have to check, and because I put your name on a thing that says you talk to Dr. Leary on Tuesday, and it\u2019s not optional if you want your seat back, and I thought, be kind, tell him before a machine does.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d Evan said, and he swallowed the little noise his throat had been saving for doctors. \u201cI\u2019m working on a muscle.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cYou can build a lot of muscle in one place and discover it helps somewhere else. Someone told me that once, I don\u2019t remember who, probably my wife. If you need more leave you take it; if you want to sit on a jumpseat with old men and talk about whether landing on one engine in Cincinnati is classy or stupid, you call me. We\u2019ll be here when you decide you can look at the glass without choking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Evan said, and this time he meant it without any little darts of irony at the word. He put the phone back in his pocket and felt like someone on the bridge in the first days of spring: the river still cold and mean and hungry, but the light moving differently across it and a person upstream thinking of taking their shoes off.\n\nThat afternoon he found himself on the floor in the wing, holding a staple gun and a piece of muslin and swearing under his breath because he had put the staple where no staple should be. Sophie leaned over him with a look that was ninety percent pity and ten percent the joyful superiority of a woman with a toolkit. \u201cYour thumb is going to get you,\u201d she said, and a beat later it did, the staple skidding and the skin betraying him with the smallest slick. He saw it, he felt the small sting, he opened his mouth for the old air, and then he closed his mouth and decided to let the sting be loud and the sight be small. He pinched with his other hand and breathed out with a noise like someone pressing a banjo string for pitch. Vee appeared out of somewhere with the little box of silly Band-Aids they kept for exactly this, the ones with cartoon clouds and the ones with a line for your name which amused Tess every time. \u201cI am not falling,\" he said, and Vee, without making a face that would make him hate her, said, \u201cI know,\u201d and put the cloud on his thumb as if she were doing a magic trick for a child she decided to like.\n\nNoah swept like a person who had found a religion, and when he slumped on the stage with his broom lying across his shins like an instrument he would refuse to learn, Evan sat next to him and passed him a bottle of water like it was contraband. \u201cYou could teach sweeping,\u201d he said, and Noah said, \u201cYou could teach talking into a microphone,\u201d and Evan said, \u201cI could teach saying \u2018Hold\u2019 to a room until the room does it,\u201d and Noah said, \u201cI need that,\u201d and took a drink like he had understood the metaphor and made it literal to be safe.\n\nThey talked about paint and doors and the boy said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could ask a room to behave,\u201d and Evan said, \u201cMost rooms like to be asked,\u201d and Noah nodded with that hungry face boys have when someone offers them an adult sentence with their name on it. When Noah went to the lobby to carry two heavy things that had been designed to look light, Evan looked at the chalk cups he had drawn and saw they had smudged into little moons, and he did not redraw them because there\u2019s a time to redraw and a time to let a line go back into the air.\n\nThere were storms in the forecast and the sky made a half-hearted drama of it all afternoon, a darkening that never committed, a rumbling that made the high windows in the booth twitch two millimeters every twenty minutes. Evan took this weather like a quiz he had not studied for, kept his paper blank for a while, then wrote his name on it, then decided to stay. When the rain finally came, it came as if scolded into doing its job, an efficient discipline. The building liked rain; it had learned to be hugged by it. The light board arcs sounded different when the dust above them found water; the air took the ghost of a smell like someone had ironed a thousand shirts in the next room and the doors were left open on purpose. He pressed \u201cGo\u201d with dry fingers and considered the nights he had pressed \u201cGo\u201d with sweating ones and the way humans mistake that for courage.\n\nWhen he got home, June had left a Tupperware marked with masking tape that said \u201cRoast you can live with,\u201d and a note that said, \u201cWent to book club, do not let them make me read anything where all the women are mean to each other.\u201d Arthur had underlined an article in the paper about the city council and left the page for Colm on the table with a highlighter as if he were training a parrot to speak. Colm came in late with a smell like rain on wool and sat without turning on the light. In the dark, with only the street\u2019s offering making the edges of the room visible, he said, \u201cThe boy has good hands for doors,\u201d as if announcing a grade on a report card. Evan said, \u201cHe wants to not make trouble,\u201d and Colm said, \u201cNobody wants to make trouble. They want to be listened to without qualifying the listening. That is different,\u201d and Evan did not disagree.\n\n\u201cDid you find the ring,\u201d Colm asked after a minute, and Evan said, \u201cI found a ring,\u201d and that was sufficient because sometimes a ring is an answer and sometimes it is a place for a better question to sit. They sat with that for a while without messing it up by talking around it. The house made a shift sound like a person turning over in sleep on the other side of a wall. Evan ate a piece of roast standing up because no religion should be pure. He poured water and looked at the glass and tried to see if it wanted to be cruel; it looked like what it was, a thing that holds and is held.\n\nOn Monday the theater was a shopping list. Tess put assignments on the whiteboard that had been cleaned so much it had its own sky. \u201cPostcards at the coffee places,\u201d she wrote, then added, \u201cbut only where they like us,\u201d and \u201cfix the squeaky hinge on the second row because it\u2019s starting to think it\u2019s in the show,\u201d and \u201cteach Noah to run house lights by Friday or else,\u201d with three exclamation points she would later deny. Evan went out with Vee to tape a flyer to a bulletin board that did not believe in tapes and watched as she argued with the cork until it admitted her pushpin. In the window of the haberdashery pretending to be necessary, a mannequin with no head wore a tie like a wound. Vee said, \u201cMy father used to wear those ties and have opinions about the shoes of men on television,\u201d which was a bigger sentence than she usually let out in daylight, and he said, \u201cMy father used to forget I could see him,\u201d which landed between them with a polite clink, like utensils on a placemat.\n\n\u201cDo you go to see him,\u201d she said after they had both decided they would not comment on what they had said, and he said, \u201cI go to the place he works because it\u2019s in my town and because his sorry shape is part of the skyline. He shapes wood with insistence and I have to respect that. He told me boys don\u2019t faint. He was wrong in a category larger than fainting. He had a cut once, on his hand, and he slapped me when I fell down, and I keep walking past that in my head like it\u2019s a picture in a hall I don\u2019t have time to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoors you don\u2019t want to open are still doors,\u201d Vee said, not gently and not unkind, and he felt a little angry because she was not in his family and how dare she be right, and then he realized he was not angry at her at all but at the sentence for being clever and true at the same time.\n\nThat afternoon, in a little pocket of nothing between acts and rain, a woman stood in the lobby holding her purse the way people hold Bibles when they aren\u2019t sure they believe. She had a face that had been careful for many years and had lately quit. She said to Evan, \u201cMy kid was the one who asked you about mistakes,\u201d and he said, \u201cYour kid is good at questions.\u201d She said, \u201cHe told me you said you forgive yourself quickly so you can stop making it. He said it while he was trying to fix the faucet I have been yelling at for two months and it made me want to lie down on the floor and cry like one of those women in movies who always end up married again by the end. Do you really do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I forgive and sometimes I perform forgiving and hope the rest catches up,\u201d he said, which was more exposure than a lobby requires. \u201cSometimes I make the same mistakes because I like them. Sometimes I make new ones and praise myself for the variety.\u201d\n\nShe laughed in that dangerous way where the next sound could be anything and said, \u201cYou\u2019re very unhelpful in the way that makes me feel less alone,\u201d and then she bought two tickets and left with a walk like someone who had remembered she is funny.\n\nThat night the town had a sound like cutlery being put away after a party that had not been a success. The red mark came back in dreams in a smaller size, on the glass of a bus and on the back door of the theater and on the countertop where June had left a note about milk. He woke and went to the kitchen and drank water and pressed his thumb to the little cloud Band-Aid until its adhesive reminded him of childish loyalty. He thought of tomorrow and the man with the beard and the office with the airplane picture and the particular kind of reporting he would have to do about himself. He had feared storms and learned to fly in them. Now he had learned to light a room so that storms could be theater. He would sit in a chair and say a word like \u201cpanic\u201d and wait for the person across from him to nod like a priest who has seen stranger sins. He would say \u201cbird\u201d as if it were both an apology and a punchline. He would say \u201cblood\u201d on purpose in a sentence and feel the way the air handles the word differently depending on who had invited it, doctor or actor or man in a kitchen at night with his hand on a glass.\n\nTuesday was blue and efficient. The office where Dr. Leary worked refused to be anything other than a room, which somehow helped. There were magazines older than most of the people who would read them. The receptionist had hair in a clip that reminded him of a rib. When he sat with the man whose job it was to make pilots tell the truth, he thought of checklists and found himself relieved. \u201cWhat brings you here,\u201d the man said in that voice that is taught in the rooms where therapists renew their licenses, and Evan said, \u201cBirds do not bring me here, but they are the excuse, and blood is not a storm but my body thought otherwise,\u201d and the man said, \u201cGood,\u201d as if he adhered to the church of naming things. They talked about cockpit doors and door doors and about the smell of iron that may or may not exist, and the man did not tell him he was ridiculous and did not tell him he was brave and told him instead, \u201cWhat your amygdala is doing makes sense; it lacks context; we give it context; you go back when your body quits tripping the alarm at the wrong party.\u201d\n\nHe left the office feeling like he had been given homework he did not hate. He drove past the airport and did not go in because he did not want to test any spells, and because he wanted to keep the runway a promise and not a dare. He went to the theater, which had become, for all its cobbled charms and its leaks and its smell of ten years of caffeine, a sanctuary. Tess looked at him and did not ask. She handed him a roll of tape and said, \u201cThe broom closet is rebellious; domesticate it,\u201d and he did, arranging mops like soldiers, a satisfaction so clean it made him want to change his name.\n\nAfter the show that night they did notes with Tess doing her best impression of a mean person because everyone had done well and praise makes them lazy. \u201cSophie,\u201d she said, \u201cyour shirt is noisier than your scene; don\u2019t let cloth upstage your grief,\u201d and \u201cMarcus, the hat is not a character, put it when you put it and stop letting it flirt with the audience,\u201d and \u201cVee, you are one sigh too many; keep one for later; trust me; you can always sell your sighs at the market,\u201d and \u201cEvan, your \u2018Standby\u2019 is perfect but you are touching the faders with your middle finger like a man in a French film; use your whole hand so they know you\u2019re married to the job.\u201d He nodded like a student and made his fingers obey and felt the small rush of having changed a habit problem-side down.\n\nWhen they were almost out the door Noah came running in through the alley with a look on his face that made Evan want to block a doorway and make the room smaller and safer by the square foot. \u201cThere\u2019s a\u2014\u201d Noah said, and then did not say it because he had learned about not letting nouns win. He made instead a shape with his hands like two things that had loved each other and then been separated. \u201cAt the bridge,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone put something in the cup and now the cup is \u2014 I don\u2019t have the word.\u201d\n\nThey went with their coats half on. The alley had the trash smell of a city that is too polite to admit it is a city. The bridge had the look of a patient being visited by too many people who claim to be relatives. The chalk cups, or what remained, had collected rain and dust and small kindnesses, and someone, because humans cannot resist a vessel, had put a pebble in one, and someone else had put a broken bottle cap in another, and someone, because youth is exuberant, had put a cigarette butt in the last. The pebbled one was fine, the cap one was a joke that didn\u2019t hurt, and the cigarette had burned the chalk edge into a black scar like an eyelash too long and too close to the flame. Colm stood and looked at the small damage like a man who has to admit he forgot to put something out of reach. Evan crouched without wanting to and put his hand near the burn because the smell of it had the same joke as fake blood, it suggested one thing and was another, and he could take that right now.\n\nNoah rocked on his heels like a child pretending not to need to pee. \u201cDid I ruin it,\u201d he said softly, and Evan understood the grammar of that question, the I means all of us, the it means the thing we made and the thing making us. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, because in this case no was true. \u201cWe are practicing. We will forget where the chalk is and we will leave the tape in the wrong drawer and we will invite something in with our big red hands and then we will put cups in the right place and ask for the right kind of quiet.\u201d\n\nColm wiped the ash with his sleeve and made a face because he adored his sleeve. He took out a rag like a conjurer not because he had hidden one but because he had prepared one and was now pleased by his own competence. He wiped until the black was a memory. He drew the cup again, smaller, in a place where a shoe would have to be rude to hit it. He said, very quietly and only once, \u201cStay,\u201d and Evan watched his brother\u2019s breath and saw how it matched the water and learned another thing about what he was really doing here.\n\nOn the seventh night since they began calling it a run, the audience contained a man with a scar through his eyebrow and a woman with a scarf that had traveled more than she had. June sat in the front row and held her hands in her lap the way she would if she were on a bus with a baby nobody knew where to look at. Arthur took notes in the dark with a pen that glowed, which made him look like he had been given a position by a deity. Colm stood for a long time and then sat when someone else wanted that space more. Evan pressed \u201cGo\u201d and he meant it. He said \u201cStandby\u201d and the word did not sound like a lie. He put the river and the ring and the chalk and the boy and the bus and the nose and the glass and the bridge in a place in his chest that was not a closet and not a trash bin; it was a shelf. He felt the shelf hold. He felt the shelf shudder and then settle. He put his hand on the fader and let his whole palm touch it like vows are supposed to be touched, with all available surface. The red moved like a language. The stage breathed like a thing that loves you when you do not deserve it and which will be there when you do.\n\nAfter, he stood in the door on the side of the stage where the actors go out to smoke and make pronouncements and said to Noah, \u201cYou draw the cups tomorrow, if they need them,\u201d and Noah said, \u201cI will,\u201d and then, as if offering information about the weather, \u201cI told my mother I made a door by accident and she said she had made three on purpose and we laughed,\u201d and Evan thought that maybe, if there were an after, this would be what earned them it.\n\nLater, in bed, with the window open just enough to argue with June\u2019s preferences, he dreamed, not of the cockpit or the stage, but of a room that had been both and neither, a room with bolts and light and the smell of warmed dust, a room where there was a switch and the switch had a label and the label was his name. He pressed it, in the dream, and nothing terrible happened and the room did what rooms do when you ask them with your whole hand. He woke to a morning that did not mind being itself and made coffee and went downstairs and said \u201cGood morning\u201d to the house the way he sometimes said \u201cHold\u201d when no one was listening and meant it.",

June had left a bowl of apples on the table and the newspaper folded to the page Arthur would want to scold, and the light came in over the sink with that late-morning leniency that forgives any number of late nights. He poured coffee and let it be coffee without auditioning it for metaphor, because there are days when even men who like to name things permit nouns to be just nouns. When he looked up, Colm was already there in a chair like he had grown from it overnight, the warmth around him banked and thrifty, his hands around a mug as if he were cooperating with a ritual and not leading it. \u201cToday is a day for errands,\u201d Colm said, as if he had checked with the calendar personally, and June, who never believed in light work, said, \u201cErrands are what life is made of,\u201d and handed him a list with her handwriting marching, as if it had been trained in a tiny army where persuasion outranked force.\n\nOn the way to the Evergreen he detoured on purpose by the turnoff to the airport, the lanes blued with paint in numbers that will outlive the people who painted them. He did not pull in, because there is a difference between flirting and making trouble, but he let himself look at the sign until the shape of the word felt like a thing he could put in his mouth again without choking. Max texted him a picture of a weather radar with a little circle around a chunk like a bruise and a caption that said, \u201cShe\u2019s ugly and leaving for Pittsburgh,\u201d which was Max\u2019s way of showing affection. He sent back a picture of the light board with faders standing like wheat and wrote, \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful and doesn\u2019t move without me,\u201d and Max answered with fifteen thumbs-up that made him weirdly grateful for the stupid language of icons.\n\nTess met him at the door with a map of the day, which was her face. \u201cWe have a kindergarten at ten,\u201d she said, moving a roll of tape from wrist to wrist like a bangle with obligations, \u201cand they will ask better questions than the high schoolers and wipe their noses on our seating if we are not quick with the tissues. Then tech notes because we have gotten cocky and the lights got out of their lanes last night and I will not be made a liar by electricity. Then the mayor\u2019s assistant would like to pretend we are a symbol and take a photo in which she will stand too close to a ladder and I will move her gently with my eyes. Also, someone put a handprint near the box office that is not in our paint palette. Bring your patience.\u201d\n\nThe handprint was small and sincere in the wrong red, at the corner where people brush without noticing because bodies do that in buildings. It was not a horror film of a thing; it looked like a child had pressed curiosity to the wall, an experiment in, What will happen if I give away this much of my shape. He felt his stomach somehow step aside and make room for it, and the relief that came with that made his eyes prick, which annoyed him in the exact way relief will when it shows up in rooms you didn\u2019t invite it to. \u201cI have vinegar,\u201d Vee said, already there, already wielding a rag with the authority of someone who had done this ritual on three continents in rooms with worse attitude. \u201cI will charm it; you will not watch; Sophie will mutter about paint wearing thin and then fix it with a recipe she learned from a grandmother who taught her to knit and fight in the same hour.\u201d He let them work, because masculinity had lain down in him for the morning and decided to nap, and because his function right then was to rehearse saying \u201cHold\u201d to a room full of five-year-olds who would ignore him with more grace than most adults.\n\nKindergarten audiences are a religion if you let them be, and Tess had long ago become their liturgy. He said, \u201cHalf hour,\u201d and got back a hundred versions of \u201cWhat Is Half of Anything,\u201d and then he said, \u201cFive,\u201d and watched a child near the aisle hold up a hand and count his fingers to make sense of being told to count at all. They watched the show with the kind of reverence children have for anything that looks like it requires adult permission, and then they made a sound at the red fabric that was neither gasp nor laugh but that little \u201coh\u201d cats make when you open a new can. One boy asked if the fabric was a snake and if the snake would bite the bad guys, and Vee, who had unfolded herself into teacher for the duration, said, \u201cThere are no bad guys, only people who forgot what room they were supposed to be in,\u201d and the boy looked satisfied, like the world had been returned to him in a condition he could hold.\n\nAfter, a pale girl with hair like thread asked Evan into the mic, \u201cAre you afraid when it is dark and your mom is not there,\u201d and he said his mouth\u2019s truth before his defenses could reassemble: \u201cI am afraid and then I am not,\u201d which turned out to be the exact dose she required. He gave her a flashlight and her teacher looked like she was going to cry and then didn\u2019t, because you can tell a teacher by the way she treats her tears as capital to be spent wisely. Vee cleaned the handprint with vinegar and laughter and left a faint pink memory that couldn\u2019t harm a soul, and Sophie blended paint while humming something you would not believe she knew, and for an hour the whole building behaved.\n\nAt noon Tess sent them to the coffee shop with a stack of postcards and the instruction to flirt with restraint, which Vee interpreted as a mandate to stare down a barista\u2019s moustache until it agreed to put the cards in front instead of under the tip jar. The mayor\u2019s assistant arrived as threatened in heels that were a joke on the idea of pavement and stood with Tess near the ladder for a photo that would be captioned with words about Community and Art and Partnership, none of which would include the price of gaff. \u201cWe love small businesses,\u201d the assistant said, and Tess said, \u201cWe are smaller than you can be without falling through the grates,\u201d and someone in the assistant\u2019s brain wrote it down and labeled it folksy so it could be pulled out later at fundraisers to charm a crowd that pretended it couldn\u2019t be charmed.\n\nThe power decided to be a character at two, in the middle of a cue-to-cue that Tess had insisted on because she liked to iron the same clothes three times if anyone was going to stare at them. There was a blip and a sound like an old radio pretending to die theatrically, and then the rich dark that has weight came up from the floor and sat in everyone\u2019s lap. Someone said \u201cShit,\u201d and someone said \u201cSorry,\u201d and someone else tried to fix both with humor, which was the local currency. Evan\u2019s body tried on an old habit, the one where dark is bad because dark is a prelude to alarms and glass and the smell of wrong; then his body remembered his other job, the one where dark is a garment they put on and take off with style. \u201cHold,\u201d he said, not loud but full, and the room obeyed because it needed someone to tell it what to do with its new silence. He said, \u201cHouse to half when she comes back and worklights on battery,\u201d to no one in particular and to his hands, and Vee, who had a flashlight on her keychain because she is the sort of person who expects to be asked to fix things in rooms she doesn\u2019t even like, snapped a beam down the aisle and made the darkness decide to be a hallway and not a swamp.\n\nThe audience of no audience behaved, sitting where they were as if they had paid for the right not to make a sound. The lights made their slow-tortoise return: the emergency strips first, then the green exit signs that suggest salvation and bureaucracy at once, and finally, grudgingly, the ghost light on its pole, which Evan loved in the way that children love talismans. He set up the board to come back online with the gentle hand a person uses on a friend who is pretending to be more fragile than it is, and when the dimmers coughed the cough Tess had predicted he coughed back, because petty machinery sometimes responds to mockery. \u201cWe will do that again,\u201d Tess said to the universe after the room consented to be a stage, and the universe said, in its way, You will or I will.\n\nThe tub of stage blood is an object that will teach humility if you are arrogant and slapstick if you are not, and that afternoon it decided to make its case by leaping off a table as if bored. Marcus had moved too quickly, blessing of his character, and the lid had not snapped, and the tub did what tubs do when you leave them with no supervision\u2014it took the floor for a brief red sermon. Someone made a sound with their mouth like an old car\u2019s brakes and Vee started to swear in a language that did not exist and Evan\u2019s eyes did their old trick, trying to pull the world in to one small spot, then his fingers saved him by putting gloves on before his head could be brave or cowardly. He knelt, and the ridiculous smell got there before the image, thank god\u2014chocolate and corn syrup and the shame of convenience. He scooped and wiped and made the movement more important than the color and said out loud, like he was teaching his own hand a song, \u201cIt\u2019s candy,\u201d and felt the sweet destroy the iron in his head. Tess underlined the moment with a quip\u2014\u201cI told you I don\u2019t believe in realism\u201d\u2014and Sophie brought a mop with the solemnity of a nurse, and slowly the floor was a floor again and not a metaphor audition.\n\nIn the late afternoon, when the time for catastrophes had expired for most normal buildings, Colm came in looking like a man who had made progress on a list and still had items that would eat him if he looked away too long. He had a smudge of something on the knuckle of his right hand that wasn\u2019t dirt and wasn\u2019t oil; if you asked, he would say it was from a lock that had decided to be poetic for an hour. He watched Evan from the back of house for a few minutes, in his way of measuring whether a person\u2019s work had grown teeth or grown shy, then crooked a finger like a magician who has finally learned to ask before he pulls a coin from behind your ear. \u201cThere\u2019s a place,\u201d he said, because that was always how it began, \u201cthat used to be a bowling alley and is pretending now to be storage for a future that never arrived. Someone with spray cans and grief has been practicing there. Before it graduates to bridges again, we might ask it to study in private.\u201d\n\nThe building was not far, because nothing in the town was ever far enough to be safe. It had been a place where people let balls go and waited for the world to make sense in ten neat explosions, a place of beer and shoes with other people\u2019s ghosts in them, and now it held folded tables and optimism in boxes. The back door was the kind the town favored, metal with a rumor of rust and a bar like an instruction to the hand. Inside, light came through slats and dust in stripes, which would have made artists happy if artists hadn\u2019t already found themselves something to be happier about. The lanes were there under a patchwork of carpet and plywood like old bones under a new skin, and the pins were gone except one, standing in the corner like a witness who knew it would not be called.\n\nOn the far wall someone had been practicing a language he or she did not speak. The red on concrete, in hand and palm and stroke and slither, was the work of someone who liked the feel of it, which is sixty percent of how trouble happens. Colm stood like a man at a museum, patient, letting the painting notice him before he noticed it in any useful way. Evan measured his breath against the room, felt the old crunchy lift of his chest and then the smarter slow. He carried in with him the theater\u2019s softness\u2014the way a person can move light like water and have it be consequence rather than command\u2014and he set up the small work lights they had stuffed in the back of the car, clamping them to a beam the way you clamp feelings to the usable part of your day.\n\nThe light changed the red immediately, because light is rude and has no loyalty to anyone\u2019s intention. The handprints that had tried to be solemn became affectionate, the streaks that wanted to be wounds cooled to something closer to crayon. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a room,\u201d Colm said, as if they were putting together the shelving unit of a god. \u201cThen we\u2019ll ask the room to remember itself.\u201d He took out chalk, the cheap kind that does not pretend to be indelible, and Evan had the ridiculous thought that he should apply for reimbursement.\n\nThey drew the cups, not making prisons but making invitations, small, low, at the base of the shapes where the red wanted to drip if it were liquid, which it wasn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t draw over hands; they drew near them, a politeness learned from cleaning up after children and elderly men who still insist on cutting their own bagels. Noah arrived because he had been everywhere all day, vibrating at the edges and sending his willingness ahead of him like a dog that wants to be liked. He looked at the wall and then at Evan and then at the chalk with a face that had learned very quickly where not to put itself. \u201cDo I,\u201d he asked, and Evan said, \u201cYes, and say something nice,\u201d and Noah, who had run out of profound two days ago and now had to let honest carry him, said, \u201cThank you for showing me what not to do,\u201d and the lines settled.\n\nThey did not perform ritual because ritual is a trap when you don\u2019t know the language. They did small things that had, if you were a certain kind of person, the shape of ritual at the edges. Colm breathed so that his breath matched the room, which is what he does when he is being the kind of ridiculous no one can teach, and Evan adjusted a light and felt his body do that clean, mechanical joy it does when a thing is correct before intention can put a signature on it. He realized the old ache in him had a rule he could exploit: if he could make his hands the most important part of what he was doing, his eyes would agree to be junior partners. \u201cStay,\u201d Colm said to the wall and to whatever wanted to pull tricks on the edges of it, and then, after a beat in which no one was inconvenienced, he said, \u201cGo,\u201d very gently, like telling water it may return to being itself.\n\nAfter, they walked around the building like nurses, checking windows and corners and the place where a back stair makes a decision about whether it is a place for secrets. A woman with keys came and thanked them with a thank-you card she had written before anyone made her grateful, the kind of faith that will always charm Colm and make him try not to say so out loud. She told them about the bowling league that had written its names on a napkin and lost them and then made do with calling each other \u201cyou,\u201d and she laughed the small laugh of someone who doesn\u2019t get to tell her stories in rooms where people are listening. He let her talk long enough for the room to register something besides red and chalk, and then they left, because if you stay too long after you close a door you start to doubt hinges.\n\nEvan saw it then for the first time, the way the warmth around Colm dimmed and brightened like something with a battery. It would be funny if it weren\u2019t so much like the cost of all things we love when we use them too hard. He said nothing, because love is occasionally smart, but the noticing changed him a degree or two, which is how loyalties grow up and become obligations you can keep happily. Back at the house June was making a cake that didn\u2019t believe in sugar and insisted on being loved anyway, and Arthur was reading the paper out loud to someone not present, perhaps his younger self, and when Colm sat down he did it like a man who\u2019d taken a long vow and brought it to completion for the day. \u201cYou look thinner around the edges,\u201d Arthur said, which might have been a joke or might have been a mercy. Colm smiled with half of his face and stole a piece of the cake that had been set aside specifically so he could steal it, because this was a house that understood the theater of justice.\n\nA letter came with the evening\u2019s mail in a windowed envelope that would have been funny at any other time, and Evan took it outside and opened it on the porch because some sentences prefer weather. Fischer\u2019s office and the company\u2019s logo made a marriage up top as unromantic as any document, and the words under them were ordinary and devastating in a gentle way. They had put him on a simulator schedule eight days hence, on a morning when the sky would probably do its very best to mind itself, and they used words like \u201cevaluation\u201d and \u201creadiness\u201d and \u201csupport\u201d that were either genuine or learned, which, in the end, feels the same if you\u2019re the one trying to breathe. He stood with the paper and thought of the light board, of the way your thumb finds the switch without consulting you, the way your body sometimes makes decisions your mind can later claim as its own if it wants the credit. He thought of saying \u201cHold\u201d into a headset and how nice it had been when a room listened. He thought of saying \u201cHold\u201d to his own blood and having it proceed with its business anyway.\n\nHe told Tess because you tell the person you work with that something will change the way your mouth says \u201cGo,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood,\u201d with a plainness he valued. She did not congratulate him as if he\u2019d won a thing; she put him into a list in which his absence would matter and did not act like that meant the list would end. \u201cI will make Noah sit in your chair when you are gone,\u201d she said, and Noah, in the doorway like a cat you forgot letting in, said, \u201cI will sit, I will sit,\u201d and then immediately assumed the posture of a person panicking quietly at being given a lever. Vee said nothing for a whole minute, and then she said, \u201cIf you leave, I get to use your pen and ruin the nib,\u201d which was her way of admitting to feelings that would otherwise make her eyes too wet.\n\nHe told June because a mother is a form of air you have to keep honest, and she said, \u201cThey will be lucky to have your nerves again,\u201d which would have sounded perverse if anyone else had said it. Arthur pointed at the envelope with a fork and said, \u201cComing and going is the work of men and trains; do it without drama and you will have done well,\u201d which made June smack his wrist with a towel and say, \u201cHe is allowed drama at least until next Thursday,\u201d and Arthur suffered the smacking like a man who has been punished better for worse.\n\nThe day before he was to go, the bus driver from the dawn and the glass came into the theater, hat in hand because that is how some men come into rooms with curtains. He watched from the back for a while, the way people do when they\u2019re deciding whether a thing is a mirror or a window, and when Evan said \u201cStandby,\u201d the man\u2019s shoulders made a shape, comprehension of ritual, recognition of power used for good. After the show he stood near the booth and said, \u201cThe tape stayed,\u201d and Evan said, \u201cGood,\u201d which was both reply and sacrament. The man said, \u201cI put my hand where the small hand had been, and for a minute I thought I was in church,\u201d and then he left because he had a route and because some people will always speak one sentence longer than they think they are allowed and then go before anyone can be rude to the overage.\n\nOn the last night before the sim, Tess made them do notes after the house had gone home, even though everything had been fine enough to leave alone. \u201cI do this so you don\u2019t forget the world is bigger than the size of your accomplishments,\u201d she said, which made Marcus groan theatrically and Sophie grin because authority wrapped in kindness is her favorite candy. She told Vee to pick a different shirt for the scene where she held the scissors because the current one insisted on finding light that didn\u2019t want it. She told Noah to stop trying not to move the brush when he swept, because trying not to is a movement too and makes twice the work. She told Evan his voice on the mic had found a register people trust, and then she added, \u201cDon\u2019t keep it when you don\u2019t need to, your friends will make fun of you for sounding like a god in a kitchen,\u201d which made him promise not to order toast like a tyrant.\n\nHe didn\u2019t sleep as badly as he\u2019d planned. Fear does not always behave and sometimes chooses to be boring, which is a relief disguised as an insult. He woke with his lungs in his chest instead of near the door and made coffee and let June put a banana in his bag because potassium is a religion if she\u2019s in the room. Colm drove him to the airport because he cannot not be the person who carries men to doors and waits near the hinge. They said almost nothing on the way, because men who like words know when to leave them in the house and let the day do the talking. At the curb, where men hug like they are making a trade in a marketplace where everything is a little too expensive, Colm squeezed his shoulder and said, \u201cWhichever room you are in, you do not owe it blood,\u201d which was more than a blessing and less than a curse, and then he let go because letting go is the only trick worth perfecting.\n\nThe simulator building is the opposite of theater in that it refuses to be romantic, which is its own kind of mercy. Fluorescent light is honest even when it is cruel, and the chairs have been sat on by men at their smallest and men at their bravest and do not care. Dr. Leary had sent him a link with breathing in four-square and a suggestion that he consider the bright idea of not losing six pounds of water through fear in an hour, and he took the suggestion and breathed as if someone had asked nicely and not because he wanted to impress anyone. The sim itself, the cockpit on stilts with a brain, was so close to familiar his fingers tried to skip the part where they asked permission, and he made them behave like guests at a good party.\n\nThe instructor had white eyebrows that made him look kind even when he was not sure he was being, and he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go where you take us,\u201d which is an outrageous sentence in that room, and then he gave Evan the weather of his own week: clear enough but daring you to lie. He ran the checklist and let the list run him, which is how you do anything good. When it was time to lift, he lifted. When it was time to pretend to land because men in rooms with expensive machines love to be generous by inventing disaster, he pretended to land in a wind that had decided to tell jokes. When it was time to lose an engine and decide that one becomes two by a sort of math you can\u2019t teach children, he found that old place that isn\u2019t bravery, exactly, but the reliable result of training that has gone into your bones.\n\nThey did not spill fake coffee. They did not make the fake headlines. They did not look at a bird pretending to be a plane and have to renegotiate centuries. He saw red differently once, not from the window, but from the panel\u2019s little lights, when an indicator for a thing that wasn\u2019t a thing blipped and he felt his old alarm ring like a neighbor at a door they should not have a key to. He said \u201cHold,\u201d under his breath, because he can\u2019t stop being a small liturgy now, and then he said, \u201cGo,\u201d and the fake plane did as asked. When they were done, his shirt clung in a way that would embarrass you if you were seventeen and vain, and the eyebrow man said, without flourish, \u201cYou\u2019ll live,\u201d which might have been the highest praise any sacred room could give.\n\nThe lobby on the way out had a pot plant pretending to thrive and a bulletin board with notices for seminars no one would attend unless their licenses depended on them. He sat for a minute on a bench and let his body catch up with itself, then texted Tess a single word\u2014\u201cGo\u201d\u2014which she would read into whatever she had at hand. He texted Colm a picture of his shoes on industrial carpet and wrote, \u201cI am where the room asks,\u201d and Colm replied with a picture of chalk dust on his fingertips and wrote, \u201cSo am I.\u201d He drove back to town with the odd feeling a person has when he has done the thing he feared he could not do and now must decide what to do with the part of him that was keeping fear as a pet.\n\nThe theater smelled like warmed dust and cut fruit when he walked in, and the light in the booth was doing that slow pulse the dimmers sometimes do when they think people will forgive them for having mood. Noah had written \u201cStandby\u201d on a sticky note and stuck it to the edge of the console because he is a poet even when he means to be mechanical. Vee looked at him and said, \u201cYou look like you met a man who was kind to you and you didn\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d which is almost what had happened, and he said, \u201cI pressed \u2018Go\u2019 in another room,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood, no one died,\u201d and he said, \u201cCorrect, and I wore a shirt,\u201d and she said, \u201cStop, we\u2019re about to be friends and I haven\u2019t decided if I can afford one.\u201d\n\nThe show that night held him like it had missed him, which is something that buildings do not do but which, if you hold them in your mind just right, feels true. He said \u201cStandby\u201d and knew the word in two languages now, the language of switches and the language of breath, and both belonged to him in a way he didn\u2019t have to argue for. The red fabric moved, and the audience, those strangers who are always cousins, made the noise that makes all the rest bearable, and he put his hand on the fader with his whole palm and let himself belong to the lever and the room without tithe or smear, without forgiveness demanded on credit from a future that owed him nothing.\n\nAfter, in the alley with the rain finally good and earnest, Colm lit nothing and stood with his hands empty for once. \u201cWhen a man learns to be two things he must not be surprised when he discovers a third,\u201d he said lightly, then shrugged as if he had not meant to say any of it out loud. Evan laughed without cruelty and said, \u201cIs the third a man who knows where we keep the extra gaff,\u201d and Colm said, \u201cIt is also that,\u201d and then leaned shoulder to shoulder the way he does when he is very tired and very proud of someone else, and they breathed in a rhythm the building under their feet approved of without saying so.",
