     "novel_text": "The wind did its old Wellington thing, nudging, pushing, slapping at me as if to say, move along, mate, nothing to see here. Tin roofs rattled and murmured in a code you only learn by staying, by putting up with that sideways rain that doesn\u2019t fall, it ambushes. I stood by the fence out back of the flat, feeling the rimu pailings shiver against my shoulder every time a gust came up from the south. Late afternoon, light like old honey poured into a cracked jar. I finished a cig I shouldn\u2019t have started, blew smoke I couldn\u2019t afford, and watched it vanish as if the air itself had taken offence.\n\nMy name\u2019s Eli, short for Elisha, though no one except Nana ever called me that. Thirty-one, a bit frayed around the edges, running nights at a museum that was mostly empty even when it was open. Not the flash one with the earthquake room. The smaller one down near the port where tourists stumbled in looking for a toilet or a pack of postcards. My job was to keep the glass smudge-free and the floors not sticky. I was good at it, mostly because I liked being the last one to leave, the hum and buzz and click of the old building breathing like some old creature, a taniwha that had agreed, just this once, to sleep.\n\nBack then I was already hearing things. The doctor called it tinnitus and shrugged in that way doctors do when they can\u2019t do anything, a little island of power in the mouth, a lighthouse that didn\u2019t help. Personally I called it the hiss. Sometime round midnight, when the traffic lulled and the ferry out in the harbour moaned to itself, this slender thread of high, high sound would spool into my ear. It wasn\u2019t loud, not like a kettle. It was finer. Like the instant before glass cracks. Like a mosquito on the far side of a window you can\u2019t find. It bothered me. It also, and this is the difficult bit, fascinated me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re zoning out again.\u201d That was Miri, my step-sister, half in and half out of the kitchen doorway, chunky socks, hair in a eucalyptus-coloured scarf. She was only twenty-three, a barista by day and ceramicist by obsession, currently making mugs with little waves that didn\u2019t hold the tea right. She\u2019d moved in after Gareth (her dad, my stepfather for a while) had decamped to Blenheim with a woman called Leonie who liked alpacas and white furniture. There\u2019s a diagram somewhere, spiderish, that shows how our wh\u0101nau fit together. It doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that when the lease on Miri\u2019s place in Newtown morphed into something else, she turned up with three boxes and a bag of clay tools and said, \u201cI can make rent and also a hell stew.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm not,\u201d I said, flicking the cigarette into an old paint tin full of rainwater, where it hissed theatrically. Wind got my hair. \u201cJust watching the neighbours. They keep hanging washing right before a southerly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hope,\u201d she said, and went to stir the pot on the stove. \u201cCome on. Kai.\u201d\n\nInside was a warm mess. A good mess. Rimu table with three legs the same length and one a bit stubborn, a couch someone had thrown out that we draped a quilt over to make look intentional, jars with paintbrushes that weren\u2019t mine. Miri\u2019s laugh, which could be mean if she wanted it to be, wasn\u2019t tonight. The radio talked about a storm in Fiji and stopped. The lights flickered once, then held.\n\n\u201cCan you hear that?\u201d I asked, halfway through stew and leaning my ear towards the window.\n\n\u201cHear what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2026 edge. Like when you run your finger round a glass, you know, that singing thing. Like that, but tighter. Like it\u2019s in the wall.\u201d\n\nMiri stopped chewing and glanced towards the place my shoulder tried to point. Her mouth made the shape of whatever she heard. \u201cNah. You okay, Eli?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, nah, I\u2019m sweet,\u201d I lied, scooping more. The stew was heavy on cumin and sweet potato, the way she liked to cook, as if everything would be improved by that one spice that lived at the back of the shelf. It probably was improved. I swallowed and felt the sound slide deeper, a silver thread into the hollow behind my eyes.\n\nLater, at work, I tried to find it again. The museum was cool and holding a lot of echoes. Maritime stuff mostly\u2014black and white photos of men whose names weren\u2019t recorded and ships that were, old ropes behind glass cases, even an anchor as big as my bed. My boss, Graeme with an e not an a, said we conserved \u201cmaterial culture.\u201d Then he\u2019d look at the anchor like it was part of his own inside story and whisper, \u201cPurpose-built for a storm.\u201d\n\nAfter he went, I did my rounds. It\u2019s funny how your feet know the way before your head does. I wiped the fingerprints off a case with my own prints already superimposed, polished brass that didn\u2019t want to gleam any more than it already did, and in the quiet I breathed.\n\nI\u2019d noticed it worked better if I let the air through my nose and counted my heartbeats with it. In for six, wait for two, out for six. At first it was just a trick to keep panic out. Then the hiss, the thread, the singing that wasn\u2019t, edged back in. Not in the wall, not in the floorboards. Not in the anchor either. In me. Like someone had slipped a taut wire from my ribs to the space over the exhibits, and every time I inhaled slow the wire sang.\n\nThe first time anything actually happened my left hand twitched and did not catch the light the way my right hand did. Imagine holding your hands over a black bowl of water. Then imagine the reflection of the left hand going thin, like your fingers had become someone else\u2019s and could choose their own degree of being here. It freaked me out, sure, but I thought it was lighting. Museums do that to you. WellI thought so until the mop handle winked out as if it had been glued to my left palm.\n\nI choked on my own tongue and everything snapped back.\n\nI stood for a long time in the middle of the floor, glued to the cheap vinyl with a feeling like I\u2019d just taken my finger off a hot element. The mop was there. My hand was there. The anchor was still there, grim and heavy and smug as ever. It had only been a sliver of something. A shadow of a maybe.\n\n\u201cYou all good?\u201d asked the night guard on his round a few minutes later, just a man with a torch and a sigh.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, my voice the wrong pitch. \u201cDropped the mop. Stupid.\u201d\n\nHe nodded like he\u2019d heard worse things from mops and kept going. The light made a slice across the far wall. Dust motes danced in the beam like tiny underpaid actors getting paid in glow.\n\nI did not try it again that night. But I thought about it all the way home. The wind had taken a breather and the sky let a few stars through, pinholes in the bruise-coloured fabric. I caught my reflection in a closed shop window, the sort of all-night place that never quite opens. I stood in my own outline, trying to imagine the left side thinning, my ears hot with the memory of that inner song. For a full minute I felt sure that if I breathed just so I could peel away like masking tape. Then a bus went by and I was just another man on Vivian Street, jacket zipped wrong, thinking things.\n\n\u201cEli,\u201d Miri said when I came in around two, the way she says my name when she\u2019s had too much tea and is convinced she\u2019s the head of the household. \u201cDo me a favour and don\u2019t wake the neighbours with your tossing and etc. And shut the bathroom window. Cat got in. It stared at me like I owed it money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got it,\u201d I said. \u201cAlso, you\u2019ll think I\u2019m\u2026 but I think\u2026 something weird happened at work.\u201d\n\nShe was in bed, the lamp making a golden shell around her, earbuds in like grace notes. Flatmate life means learning to talk to people you love while not quite intruding on their peace. She sat up, pulled one earbud out. \u201cWeirder than the ship\u2019s captain who kept his wife\u2019s wedding ring on a chain of hair? Weirder than that time a tourist tried to pay you in euro coins and a prayer?\u201d\n\n\u201cWeirder.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Tell me in the morning. Put the kettle on.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep. The sound had gone with me into the dark, not louder, no, but close. It wasn\u2019t the obvious thing, not like the rush in your ears after a concert. It was some other version. Like being near a fence when the wind hums in it. If I lay very still, very still, it sharpened. It was as if there was a gap somewhere that only opened if you didn\u2019t stare at it, if you didn\u2019t shout. If you let your breath behave itself, and the rest of you got out of the way.\n\nMorning made everything common again in that way mornings do. Toast that jumped early and scorched thin. News about a council meeting that promised to decide nothing. Miri\u2019s pots like half-finished planets on the bench. I went to work. Tried to do the normal thing. But normal was like a jacket that didn\u2019t belong to me. A size too small in the shoulders, too shiny at the elbows.\n\n\u201cAt least pretend to mop near the front where the visitors can see you,\u201d Graeme told me, peering over his glasses like I\u2019d borrowed them without permission. \u201cAnd the school group from Naenae is coming at eleven. Captain\u2019s logbook needs to be open at page thirty-three. We paid for the copy. No sticky fingers on the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI always do the thing.\u201d\n\nHe squinted at me. \u201cYou always do a version of the thing. Do the thing. Also there was a complaint.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout the way you look at the anchor.\u201d\n\nI laughed even though he wasn\u2019t joking. You have to understand, in our museum the anchor was both a talisman and a magnet for nonsense. People came and laid their hands on it like it might cure something. A couple got engaged in front of it once, and she said yes but the look in her eyes was a no wearing a yes\u2019s clothes, and I bet I am right about that. I had been known to look at it too, to stand there and imagine all the seas it had knifed through. Also, the anchor looked back. It did. It knew when you knew it.\n\nI tried not to think about invisibility. I failed pretty fast. At ten, while the school kids were on their second set of questions (\u201cBut why is a boat?\u201d asked a boy with one shoelace undone), I slipped away towards the back, beyond the rack of whistling lifebuoys. You couldn\u2019t go fully out of the public area, not without Graeme barking, but there was a curve of wall by the diorama of seabirds where you could stand and not be anyone\u2019s immediate problem.\n\nI breathed. The hiss was shy in the daytime. I had to coax it. In for six, hold for two, out for six. I let the weight of my arms drop, my knees unlock, my jaw soften. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re trying to do yoga without a mat,\u201d Miri would have said, if she\u2019d been there. I softened more. There was a crinkle at the edges of my vision, a curtain being drawn slowly so you wouldn\u2019t notice. For half a second everything grew far away and bright at once. My skin goosebumped, fine hairs philosophised.\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d said someone tiny.\n\nI startled. A little girl in a faded pink jacket, face the shape of a full stop, had sidled up. Her teacher was herding the rest away from the anchor with the resigned energy of someone whose lunch had a definite time. \u201cSir, can you see my brother? He said he would hide. He went this way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014 I don\u2019t\u2014 I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d I began, as if my tongue had been swapped with a borrowed one. \u201cWe don\u2019t play hide-and-seek in the maritime gallery.\u201d\n\nShe blinked. \u201cWe do.\u201d\n\nAnd she ran off, and I watched her ponytail be entirely visible, and decided that maybe my gift, if it was a gift, was nothing at all. I went and helped the weary teacher herd the kids into the room with the bottled ships. One boy tried to put his finger in a ship and looked at me with a grin that promised future crimes. I smiled back because I remembered my own certain grin. Then the day wore on and so did I.\n\n\u201cStill weird?\u201d Miri asked that night, when we were both pretending we weren\u2019t too poor for takeaways by frying onions until they believed they were something else.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, pushing onions around the pan so they wouldn\u2019t burn even though they always burn exactly the same anyway. \u201cBut\u2014 okay, don\u2019t laugh. I think I\u2026 did something with my hand. Invisible. Not like magic. I don\u2019t believe in magic. Something physics-y. There\u2019s this sound I hear and if I breathe the sound does\u2026 something. Maybe it\u2019s a migraines. Migraine? I dunno the plural.\u201d\n\nMiri didn\u2019t laugh. Even her mouth didn\u2019t move. She had this way of paying attention that made you want to confess your worst bit because maybe she\u2019d keep it safe. \u201cInvisible,\u201d she repeated. \u201cLike, gone. Or like fuzzy at the edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cGone but the air knew it. Does that make sense? Probably, yeah-nah.\u201d\n\nShe put the lid on the pan, turned the heat down so the onions wouldn\u2019t turn on us. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. But a lot of things don\u2019t and then they turn out to be true.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou believe me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet. But I'll hold it as a maybe.\u201d\n\nThat night I sat on the floor of my room, back propped against the bed, and breathed. It takes time to teach your body a new trick. The hiss thin as floss. My chest stubborn. A draft sneaking under the door. Miri moving cups in the kitchen like she was trying to rearrange the whole shape of fate by making a better shelf. A car alarm starting and stopping like a bad joke. Gradually, though, the room found a tune. My breath rode it. Somewhere behind my eyes a smudge of light darkened, if that is a thing that can happen.\n\nI looked at my left hand, the unfaithful one. I told it, without words, this: It\u2019s okay to go. It\u2019s okay to not be here. It\u2019s okay, but not forever. Not always. It felt stupid and also true. My fingers loosened their loyalty. The outline of my ring finger went weary. A small moth that had been bumping itself against the wall stopped, as if I\u2019d turned down the colour in the room and it needed to recalibrate. I pressed my left palm against my right forearm just to be sure. I felt skin on skin and also the absence of something, the shadow of contact. The weird tingle when a sleeping limb starts to return to you after being stone and rope.\n\n\u201cHoly,\u201d I whispered, straight to the floorboards, so the house would hear that I had noticed it. And then my hand, half gone by my own count, slid into full nothing. There\u2019s a specific fear in that moment. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying or more in charge of their own abences than I am. It wasn\u2019t like a party trick. It was like stepping off the side of yourself and hoping there was still a side to step back to. I counted out loud without meaning to. \u201cThree. Four. Five.\u201d Because I needed numbers to build me a shelter. I breathed and felt the hiss pluck at me and I let it.\n\nWhen I brought my hand back it came slow, like a thing returning from a long walk, slightly abashed about having left. My palm was clammy. The room seemed to swell and settle. I was dizzy and not. Fear braided with something like joy. I laughed. Not the right laugh. It came out too loud, too sharp. A neighbor banged on the plaster from their side. \u201cKeep it down,\u201d he yelled, a voice I\u2019d never had the right name for. \u201cSome of us have to\u2026 whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I said, to the wall and to the moth and to the part of me that had not asked for any of this. I had done a thing. Possibly a wrong thing. I slept on the wrong thing like it was a good pillow.\n\nIn the morning I made a mistake. It was small, but that\u2019s how mistakes arrive at your door. Miri was out early for a market where she sold mugs with waves. A note on the bench said Wish me luck you stoat. I ate toast and honey over the sink because, what, plates exist only in stories? Then I decided I wanted to try again in daylight because the way the sun angled through the lace of clouds made me feel softer, less cornered by the noise. I wanted to know if I was still a person with\u2014or was I a person with and without?\n\nThere\u2019s a little alley down from our street where the garages lean into each other like old men at the TAB. Cats fight there in the evenings. Kids chalk squares that blow away. The wind in that alley has a particular smell, thin and metallic like an old ten-cent piece. I went there because it was nowhere. I went there because no one would see if I turned my hand into an idea again.\n\nI was wrong. Somebody saw. Or didn\u2019t. I never learned which.\n\nI breathed. The hiss braided around me like an eel. The alley narrowed to just me and the chalk and a dented bin and a scrap of sky. I watched my wrist turn into something else. I was in two places: inside my body and pressed against the brick, hearing the brick groan. I kept count. I\u2019ve always been a counter. Stairs, ceiling cracks, the number of times the ferry blows its horn at two in the morning when the fog gets in the way. \u201cSix,\u201d I said to the alley. \u201cSeven. Eight.\u201d Part of my forearm unwilling to meet the light. Then most. Then all. My sleeve did an odd buckle and lay against nothing. It\u2019s a thing to see yourself not there. It\u2019s a stranger\u2019s thing you walk into by accident.\n\nFootsteps. I turned my head and the hiss snapped like wire breaking. A man with a dog at the far end of the alley stopped. He had the look of someone who always goes for a walk at that time whether it rains or boils. The dog did that curious lean dogs do when they\u2019re deciding whether to bark or apply for a job. They both looked at me. Or they both looked at where I would be, the outline of me visible mostly by my own fear, by the way the slightly damp air held its breath around me like plastic wrap.\n\nI don\u2019t know what they saw. I know I froze. Freezing is a way of speaking to danger as if danger listens. I took two short breaths without counting. Idiot. The hand, without permission, stayed gone. The dog whuffed and wagged a bit, as if it smelled something interesting and not new, the way you might smell the sea if you had lived all your life inside it. The man squinted. \u201cMorning,\u201d he said, in that Wellington way like you\u2019re a neighbor until proven otherwise.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d I said back before my throat remembered it was attached to a person, and my voice made a sound. He nodded, not strange at all, and went on past. The dog looked back with those velvet eyes. As soon as they turned the corner my breath roared into me like I\u2019d been underwater. My hand came back with a sting all the way up my arm, pins and needles and a thousand small apologies.\n\nAt work that day nothing stayed where I put it. I knocked over a jar full of old nails stoically labeled Nails, old. I bumped my hip into a case. It didn\u2019t break. I got told off anyway. \u201cYou reading?\u201d asked Graeme, catching me looking at a card beside a photo for too long. \u201cThey\u2019ve been read already.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho did the reading, though?\u201d I asked, because sometimes my mouth is a badly trained creature.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, and went back to his spreadsheet like the ocean whose anchor we were bored of did not exist.\n\nAt lunch I texted my friend Jace, who fixes bikes in a shop in Aro, and who liked me enough not to ask me to talk about anything emotional. I wrote, You ever have that thing where you think you\u2019re not all there. He wrote back, Hangover? I wrote, No. Like actual literal. He wrote back a photo of a derailleur remarkable for being a derailleur and then, You coming Saturday? Band\u2019s playing. Bring Miri. It\u2019s weird time again. I said maybe. He sent the shrug emoji. I imagined telling him. Then I imagined him laughing and not meaning to. I put my phone in my pocket and took it out again. The world didn\u2019t help by being the world.\n\nIt was Miri who saw the rub of it, of course. Miri collects rubs and rubbings, she could have been a detective if the world paid detectives in cups of tea and boxes for things. That night, after a day of being scolded by my boss and smiled at by a life buoy and tolerated by a ship in a bottle, I stood in the hall and looked at my left hand like it was a piece of someone else\u2019s absentminded sculpture. Miri flicked on the hallway light without warning and caught me.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, not unkind.\n\n\u201cStretching,\u201d I lied and showed her my palms like maybe there would be calluses to prove something.\n\n\u201cDo it again,\u201d she said. Just like that. \u201cDo the thing you\u2019re not mentioning.\u201d\n\nI love and hate her for the way she knows. \u201cI didn\u2019t say\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d she said. \u201cYou breathe different. And someone emailed me from the Naenae school to say thanks for the tour, but also that the man at the bird wall went pale like he\u2019d misplaced his soul.\u201d\n\nI sighed. \u201cI can make my hand\u2026 I think I can make my hand not be. It\u2019s silly. It\u2019s a trick. I think it\u2019s the hiss in my ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d she said again. The light above our heads clicked and steadied. \u201cIf you fall over I\u2019ll catch you. Ish.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something about being watched that makes everything impossible and also necessary. I didn\u2019t feel shy with Miri exactly; I felt seen. I sat on the floor not because it was comfortable but because if my legs forgot me they couldn\u2019t take me down far. I breathed. She tilted her head towards the sound, as if she could hear it too in the bones of the house. \u201cDon\u2019t try so hard,\u201d she suggested, which is the most useless instruction and the only one that ever helps anything.\n\nSo I didn\u2019t try so hard. I let the breath make a quiet bridge. I felt the thread in my head hum, a kettle almost. My left hand went light. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, quietly. \u201cOkay.\u201d And then it wasn\u2019t there.\n\nI didn\u2019t look up at Miri\u2019s face. I didn\u2019t want to see fear or fake. I watched my absence instead like a coward. My sleeve lay against nothing again. I stuck my right finger through the place where my left palm should have been. The sensation was not-sensation and also filled with fizz. I looked up because it had to be done.\n\nMiri had her mouth open a little like she was going to whistle. Her eyes were too round. She didn\u2019t move. The unkind version of her smile was nowhere. Something softer was. It was not delight. Not quite. It was shock\u2019s cousin.\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t lying,\u201d she said, like she was adjusting her whole memory of me two degrees to the left. \u201cOh. Eli.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, because it felt like a thing for which an apology might be due, like playing with things you shouldn\u2019t in an old house.\n\nShe shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare be sorry. How long can you\u2014 are you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hand\u2019s got its own ideas,\u201d I said weakly. \u201cI can keep it for about thirty seconds at a go. Then it hurts. If I get scared it\u2026 comes back fast but I get dizzy and the ground tries to kiss me. I think someone nearly saw me in the alley. The dog saw me or didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe lowered herself to the floor until she was cross-legged, palm on the carpet like her hand needed to show the carpet something. She blew her cheeks out like she was a kid again and thinking too hard. \u201cRight. Pros and cons.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making a list?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. Pro: you can avoid small talk. Con: you might not come back. Pro: Halloween sorted for life. Con: creepy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cHelpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I\u2019m being serious,\u201d she said, seeing my flinch. \u201cWe need to understand it. Hear me? Not make it stop. Understand. Because if it exists anyway and you don\u2019t look at it, it still exists. It doesn\u2019t go away because you put your head under the duvet.\u201d\n\nI nodded. She was right about that. She\u2019s right about a lot of things. It\u2019s infuriating.\n\nShe put out her hand; I put my right one in it. She squeezed. \u201cPromise me something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell Graeme.\u201d\n\nOh I laughed. It came out the right shape this time. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell Graeme if I\u2019d found Atlantis under the stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise me something else then.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it alone if you can help it. If you\u2019re going to\u2026 go. Let me know. I\u2019ll sit there pretending to do crosswords and I\u2019ll stick your shoe under the couch so you can\u2019t go far.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy shoe?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor. Shush.\u201d\n\nWe sat on the floor for a while, hands visible, food cooling in the kitchen, the light making a buzzing sound like it was a small person with a loose tooth. The house shifted. A siren went past somewhere far enough away we didn\u2019t need to think of anyone we love. The hiss in my head moved closer and further like a tide.\n\n\u201cDoes it sound like anything?\u201d she asked, eyes closed like she could see better that way.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like\u2026 do you know the sound a fence makes when the wind goes through the wire?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a hum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThinner than a hum. More like\u2014 you know when a glass is right on the edge of cracking and there\u2019s that note it finds? Hi\u2014 no. Actually\u2026 like when you\u2019re in a field far from anywhere and there\u2019s still this electricity in the air. Like that, but in my head.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, eyes still shut. \u201cI don\u2019t hear it. But I can almost. My ear\u2019s doing a tick thing. Maybe that\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something,\u201d I said, with a certainty that surprised me. \u201cI don\u2019t know what yet.\u201d I paused. \u201cDo you think I should see someone? Like, a doctor again? Or a priest maybe? Or a\u2026 I don\u2019t know the word for a person who deals with people who go away without leaving.\u201d\n\n\u201cA therapist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you should see me. Because I\u2019m cheaper. And because if you say church I\u2019ll laugh and then regret laughing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I said again, and meant it more and less at the same time.\n\nShe reached over and tugged at the cuff of my jersey. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry for being a bit magic,\u201d she said and then, because she could hear how the word made me flinch, added, \u201cOr for being good at breathing weird. Tell you what. Tomorrow I\u2019ll come to the museum and stand near the seabirds and you can do it and if you faint I\u2019ll get you a glass of water and a lie down.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraeme will have an aneurysm.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraeme has had an aneurysm brewing since 1994, I reckon.\u201d She mirth-snorted and then sobered. \u201cEli. Be careful. If you die of this, Mum will kill me.\u201d\n\nI promised, not very convincingly, and we ate the cooled food like it was exactly as we wanted it.\n\nIf this was a story that wanted to go neatly, then the next day I would have turned my whole self off like a lamp, and Miri would have clapped politely, and we would have walked home in the wind talking about what it\u2019s like to live in a body you can open like a curtain. It wasn\u2019t that story. It was this one.\n\nThe next morning dawned with a foolish amount of clarity, sunlight breaking on everything like crockery. Miri came down to the waterfront in a jacket too thin for the air because she\u2019s stubborn about seasons; once it\u2019s officially spring she wears spring like a dare. She waved at me through the glass when I was meant to be at the front mopping for show; I waved back with a small freaked-out flourish. She held up an imaginary sign: Steady. I grinned and made the universal sign for calm down by flapping my hands like a man who cannot calm down.\n\nGraeme said, \u201cFamily on the floor again, Eli?\u201d as if our blood had spilled and stained something.\n\n\u201cVolunteer audience,\u201d I said. \u201cKeep me honest.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t like that at all, the honesty part. He moved away in a hurry, the way people do who can\u2019t chew their own truth.\n\nAt eleven-thirty, after the school group had had their turn with the anchor and the anchor had ignored them as it ignores everyone, after a German couple had asked me if the building had ever been a church and I had said no and watched them make it be a church anyway, after a woman with an American voice had asked where the toilets were like I was the keeper of the hole in the world, I slipped to the bird wall. Miri drifted too, not obvious, looking as if she were trying to read the plaque about gannets, which she could not care about. She positioned herself a metre away, hands in pockets.\n\nI breathed. The hiss had been with me all morning like a thread you can\u2019t pull because it will unspool something important. I softened my jaw. I counted. I let the building sit on my shoulders like a cloak. I looked at nothing in particular. If you look at something too hard it starts to bleed into every other thing. I wanted to avoid that. I wanted to go absent without causing an actual emergency.\n\nThe left hand went. It went easier than before. It liked being gone, I could tell. Then the wrist. I kept breathing. My shirt sleeve fell in a way that made no sense, as fabric fought physics and lost to the invisible. My forearm said, later, and stepped away, so to speak. I reached out with my right fingers to the place where I had been. It was like touching smoke. People moved through the room oblivious to the way I had partially opted out of being. The ferry in the harbour hooted twice, and someone dropped a coin and didn\u2019t pick it up.\n\nMiri didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t gasp, didn\u2019t helpfully explain me to anyone. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other and I watched as if that was the most exceptional thing in the room. I tried for my shoulder. I shouldn\u2019t have. It wasn\u2019t ready. The hiss bit. The world did a quick swivel. For a second I thought I\u2019d actually fallen but then I realized it was the other thing, the tilt before the fall. My breath lost the rhythm. The left side of my torso flickered. A child clapped because flickering is clappable. Graeme called my name like it was a tax he had to pay.\n\nAnd then the worst thing happened. A woman watched me. Not in the vague museum way people watch because they\u2019re trying to figure out where to rest their eyes. Really watched. She had a sunhat in her hands like she didn\u2019t trust it on her head. She had the air of someone who\u2019d come to look at ships and had found, to her disappointment, that ships are just ships. She watched the place where my arm should have been and wasn\u2019t, and her face said the grown-up word for why for the first time in twenty years. She made a small movement like she was going to say my name, a name she did not know.\n\nThe sound that came with that movement hurts to remember. It was inside my skull and somehow in the room, a high thin note that made the lights complain. Not like my hiss. Like the malicious cousin of it. It made a man in a suit wince without knowing why. It made the German couple cover their mouths as if someone had farted. The woman with the sunhat blinked three times and turned away, and I knew with a certainty that takes your feet out from under you that she had turned towards the door not because she didn\u2019t want to see but because she wanted to never have seen. Not everybody will be supportive. You learn that as a kid and then you learn it again every time you show your weird to the world.\n\nMy arm slammed back into place with a full-body flinch. It hurt. Not bone hurt. Nerve hurt. Like a thousand small doorbells in my skin all going off at once. I gripped my left elbow with my right, which doesn\u2019t do anything but tells your body you\u2019re here now. The room did a jump cut, then steadied. I found the shape of my breath and made it low and less interesting. I smiled, the practiced employee smile. \u201cHi,\u201d I said to no one. \u201cWelcome.\u201d\n\nMiri, bless her, became very interested in a picture of a shearwater doing something shearwatery. She did not look at me. Her profile was the face of a saint who has decided to survive. Graeme walked over like he\u2019d heard but not believed his name being called, and said, \u201cEverything is all right here,\u201d as if saying so makes it so. The woman with the sunhat left. The ferry hooted again, less kindly. I ached in places you don\u2019t name.\n\nIn the staff room later, under a poster about not eating other people\u2019s lunches that had evolved into a legal document, I had my head on the table. Miri sat next to me, not touching, like a guard dog that didn\u2019t want to be trained. She put a mug in front of my face. \u201cTea,\u201d she said. Then, after a beat, \u201cYou made a noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made a noise? The lights made a noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made a noise. A high one. It stabbed my ear. Hurt like when the bus brakes and squeals. Like the sound your hand was making invisible but outside. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Yes. Kind of. I didn\u2019t\u2014 I didn\u2019t plan it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSound is your thing. Maybe you can\u2026 contain it. Or not be so loud.\u201d She rubbed her earlobe absently. \u201cMy ear\u2019s still weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, and this time I was sorry for that.\n\n\u201cStop apologising. No, sorry. Do apologise. But also this is not your fault. You are allowed to learn.\u201d She took a sip of my tea, because that\u2019s how we are, honestly. \u201cAlso. People are not always going to clap. Did you see that woman? She did that thing where she turns the part of her brain that sees off ratchet quick and goes back to ships. Poor her.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t poor her.\u201d\n\nShe closed her mouth. \u201cOkay. Poor none of us then. Just\u2014 we cannot make this nice for everyone.\u201d\n\nI wanted to make it nice. Wanted to be the kind of phenomenon you can post about with a lot of exclamation points and little sparkles. Instead I was the wrong sort of noise in a room that asked for hush.\n\nBy the time my shift ended, the hiss had settled into an almost companionable thing. I walked home slowly, stopping at the dairy for milk and a bag of chips that tasted like salt and more salt. The evening had gone back to its default setting of wind and complaint. Light on the hills like someone had ironed it out flat. My arm was ordinary again. When I got to the flat, a note on the table said at Jace\u2019s gig and then, in Miri\u2019s quick slanted hand, You should come if you can be a person. I laughed and folded the note into a boat, an old habit that didn\u2019t save people and never would.\n\nI didn\u2019t go to the gig. I sat and listened to the hiss like it had secrets that would be polite enough to reveal themselves if only I sat still enough. I did the breathing. I did not make anything disappear. The house felt too full of neighbors and small rooms and plumbing declaring itself. At ten Miri came back with her hair smelling like smoke and bass and said, \u201cJace says he loves you, in the non-weird way. He also says you owe him ten bucks for that time he got you into San Fran for free. He keeps accounts in his heart in a very annoying way.\u201d\n\nI smiled because that was a gift. \u201cTell him I love him back. In the same currency.\u201d\n\nShe flopped on the couch and pulled her boots off with that noise boots make when they have had a long day of being boots. \u201cAlso he says I have to buy these stupid earplugs because he\u2019s worried about my hearing. Which is fair. But also my ears are\u2026 I dunno, they\u2019re like anxious bees now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of me,\u201d I started.\n\n\u201cBecause of everything. The world is loud, Eli. You just happened to be\u2014 you\u2019re like. Oh I can\u2019t. I need to sleep. I\u2019m inventing metaphors I can\u2019t drive. Night.\u201d\n\nI went to bed and let the sentence about earplugs hover. It was a small sentence. It would turn out not to be small at all. But that is for later, because stories have laws you can only find in the middle of them.\n\nIn the week that followed, I did two foolish things and one smart thing. The foolish things: I tried to make my whole arm go in the alley again and nearly threw up when it half did. I told Jace, who didn\u2019t laugh, but said, \u201cOkay,\u201d in that lowered voice men use for astonishment, and then he hugged me and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me more or I\u2019ll break. I\u2019m delicate.\u201d He was not. He was loud and deeply good. When I reached to show him, to prove it, he held up both hands like a man stopping traffic and said, \u201cNot here. Not now. I haven\u2019t got the brain for it yet.\u201d He left and his leaving left a shape in the room.\n\nThe smart thing: I let Miri teach me how to be less noise. She bought a little metronome cheap at the op shop, the kind piano students used to hate. We put it on the table. We watched it tick back and forth like a pendulum that believed in itself. I breathed to that. We experimented with the breath counts. We did not make me go. We did not put me to the test. We made a container. It was the first time in my life I had not rushed a new talent to the stage and demanded applause.\n\nIt was something close to enough. Not the same thing as enough. But close.\n\nAnd then, because you cannot keep the world out even if you\u2019re very, very good at hiding, the world came in anyway.\n\nGraeme called me into the office he\u2019d fashioned out of the cupboard behind the stuffed marlin. There was a chair if you were tiny and liked pain. He gestured at it. I leaned on the doorframe and pretended my spine belonged to me. He did not offer to let me be at ease. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some visitor feedback,\u201d he began, and as if he\u2019d summoned her with that phrase the woman with the sunhat walked past the door in my memory and glanced in and did not see me. \u201cSome of the younger visitors are finding the\u2014 how to put it\u2014the atmosphere of the museum unsettling. There have been reports that a member of staff is\u2014\u201d he flipped through papers he\u2019d printed as if printing words makes them truer \u201c\u2014doing tricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cleaning,\u201d I said, because it was true enough to put on a badge. \u201cSometimes cleaning looks like other things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Board was here yesterday,\u201d he said, as if that constituted a plague. \u201cYour posture was\u2026 you were breathing in a manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise to stop breathing,\u201d I said and the part of my brain that claps when I make a good joke clapped. The rest of me groaned.\n\nGraeme stared. Then he did a thing that surprised me. He took his glasses off. He rubbed the bridge of his nose. He looked my way but not at me. \u201cEli,\u201d he said, for the first time in years like my name was not a label but a call. \u201cWhatever\u2026 interest you have in\u2026 bodily peculiarities\u2026 keep them for after hours. Or take some leave. Or talk to\u2026 somebody. I need this place to be a place. Not a circus.\u201d\n\nIt hit me a beat later, the way kindness always does when you\u2019ve trained for reprimand. I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014 I\u2019ll go quiet.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do,\u201d he said, glasses back on, armour smoothed. \u201cAnd make sure the anchor\u2019s chain is properly polished. It gets\u2026 fingerprints.\u201d\n\nOn the way home I stopped by the water because that is what you do here when your head is a house full of bees. I watched the ferry come in and the little blue boats flicker around it like birds around a whale. I listened to a bus bellowing three streets away. I didn\u2019t try to disappear at all. I stood and let myself be this one shape in this one place. The wind did its usual. Someone\u2019s child dropped an ice cream and announced the tragedy to the elements. The hiss in my head did its thread thing, but it didn\u2019t have me. Not like before.\n\nWhen I came in the flat, Miri was at the table with a white box open like a treasure chest. Inside the box nestled little orange cones that looked like cartoon carrots. She lifted one between two fingers. \u201cEarplugs,\u201d she said, in the tone you use when you name a weapon. \u201cIndustrial grade, but cute.\u201d\n\n\u201cJace told you to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJace told me to, but also I thought\u2026 maybe this is how to make your noise be yours. If I can\u2019t hear it, or if the world can\u2019t hear it, maybe it\u2026 I dunno. Maybe it will let us have peace.\u201d She smiled in a way that made me ache, because there are small acts that are big. \u201cAlso, they were on special. Two-for-one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a spare?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne is for the person who lives in our house and occasionally leaves the room without getting up.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, and the shape of the future shifted two degrees. \u201cOh.\u201dThe cones were soft in the hand, little ridged carrots that promised to blunt the world. I rolled one between thumb and forefinger until the foam warmed and gave way, watching it remember and forget its own shape the way some people forgive. Miri had tipped the whole lot onto the table and they made a small orange drift, a pile of tiny safety gear that looked like a joke until you needed it. She nudged one my way with the back of her knuckle and then another, and there was something ceremonial about it, like we were laying out tools for a job neither of us had a name for yet.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re cute until they aren\u2019t,\u201d she said, which was how she felt about a number of things that turned useful. She had tied her hair up in that scarf again and the colour made me think of eucalyptus leaves bruised between finger and palm, that odd blue-green that keeps its own counsel. \u201cYou first or me first, Mr Invisible Man,\u201d she added, and her mouth did a small curve that was not exactly teasing.\n\n\u201cMe first,\u201d I said, although I wasn\u2019t sure whether I meant me wearing them or me going. I pinched one, made a torpedo out of it, and slid it into my right ear, the squish and then the slow bloom of pressure familiar from long flights I couldn\u2019t afford anymore. The left followed, and the room went fluffy around the edges, as if someone had put a pillow between me and everything else. The hiss didn\u2019t move away with the outside world. If anything, it came closer, not louder but more itself, less complicated by traffic and water pipes and Miri\u2019s spoon against the side of a cup. It was like finding a river by cupping your hands around your ears; you didn\u2019t conjure the river, you just stopped other sounds from getting jealous.\n\n\u201cYou look like a bouncer,\u201d Miri said, leaning back to see my profile. She was close enough that I could feel the warmth of her through the air, the way a fire tells your skin a story without touching it. \u201cTell me if you feel sick or if you turn grey. You do grey before you do green and it\u2019s not flattering.\u201d\n\nI breathed because that was what my body had taught itself to do when it didn\u2019t know any other way to proceed. The metronome ticked between us where she\u2019d put it, rescued from the op shop and cleaned of an old child\u2019s resentment. Tick, tock, tick, tock, and my ribs found a way to match it without quite obeying. The hiss braided through the beat, a river and a stick thrown across it, and I tried to let that thin bright thread be the thing that held me while also letting me go.\n\nMy left hand went quick, eager, a dog that knows where the beach is. The earplugs coddled the outside world and the pressure inside my head shifted one click, like a radio changing stations without telling you why. The sleeve on that side softened, then misbehaved, folding where there was nothing to fold around. I kept my breath small and courteous. Miri had put her plugs in too and she watched me with a calm that wasn\u2019t fake, her mouth pressed flat because inside the quiet she could hear her own blood sing, maybe, and she wasn\u2019t rejecting it.\n\n\u201cAnything?\u201d she asked, and even with the plugs her voice got through, because some voices move like that, through bone and memory. She didn\u2019t need to be loud to be heard by me, not just because her mouth was the one I\u2019d learned to watch for my name but because when the world is muffled you start to hear in other ways. Her hands were flat on the table and the way she pressed her thumbs into the wood was a question all by itself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 cleaner,\u201d I said, and it was odd to talk about a sound as if it had dirty edges. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to fight. I don\u2019t think the outside squeal will get out. Or if it does it will be\u2026 small. Like a knife you keep inside a drawer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall knives are still knives,\u201d she said, with the practical cheerfulness she wore when she was trying not to be dramatic. She reached out, not to touch the weird place where my hand wasn\u2019t, because she had learned that touching absence is like poking a bruise, but to rest her fingers against my wrist where I was still present enough to meet her. \u201cIt\u2019s better, though. It\u2019s kinder to everyone, including your useless boss.\u201d\n\nI held for a count I had not picked so much as fallen into. Twelve, a pause that felt like standing on a step you cannot see, then thirteen. My forearm agreed to be not-here and my elbow became a rumour, and that was further than I\u2019d meant to go at the table with orange cones between us and the kettle warming itself for a second boil. There was no slam back. There was a slow tide. When I let it reverse the water didn\u2019t slap the sand so much as return the shoreline to its old argument with the rocks. When I looked I could see where I had been absent, not a mark but a sort of dent in the air, the way you can tell something heavy sat on a cushion even after it\u2019s been lifted.\n\n\u201cThat was better,\u201d Miri said, releasing a breath I had not asked her to hold with me. She pulled one earplug out and rubbed her ear as if it were a small animal that had earned a treat. \u201cNo glass-shard note. My ear still did a little panic, but it passed quick. Less screamy. More\u2014 wind-chime adjacent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take wind-chime adjacent,\u201d I said, suddenly giddy with the relief of not having hurt her and not having broken the room. The hiss had a smugness to it now, like it had won a tiny game and was waiting for me to notice. \u201cDoes it feel different for you with the plugs in when I go?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the pressure changes and then changes back, like the weather stopped by for a second to see if we wanted anything,\u201d she said, thoughtful as if she were tasting a stew and trying to name the one spice it needed. \u201cLike when the front door opens down the hall and the air says, oh, and then forgets. You\u2019re not a storm, Eli. But you\u2019re a bit like the edge of one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been called worse things,\u201d I said, and I made myself laugh at my own joke so that she wouldn\u2019t have to. The orange cones looked ridiculous on the rimu, bright punctuation for a sentence the house didn\u2019t know how to finish.\n\nWe experimented for an hour, like a school project nobody else had assigned. We tried with only me plugged and then with only her, and then without, and each choice made the room into a slightly different room. With both of us plugged, the outside squeal didn\u2019t show up at all, and the inside thread came braided with something lower and slower, a bass line that I hadn\u2019t felt before, as if the building had its own hum and would allow me to hear it if I took away my own impatience. With only her plugged, the squeal came faint and sharp and then tucked itself back like a needle in a pin cushion, still capable of hurting someone careless, but unlikely to take out a whole ear. With neither of us plugged, the kettle of course chose that moment to boil and we abandoned the test to pour tea and watch the steam make quiet snakes.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot like when Nana\u2019s hearing aids used to go off,\u201d I said, watching the steam because it let me talk without looking at her. The hearing-aid squeal had been part of my childhood soundtrack, all those summers of Nana in her chair by the window with a book upside down and a biscuit on a plate she forgot to eat. \u201cShe\u2019d put her hand up like the queen to stop it and we\u2019d all pretend it wasn\u2019t happening even though it was happening in every room.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe used to tap them,\u201d Miri said, catching the handle of her cup with two fingers wrapped in a tea towel because she never learned to do anything in a way that didn\u2019t risk small injuries. \u201cShe\u2019d tilt her head like a bird and shush them with her thumb. You could try that with your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have hearing aids,\u201d I said, and then stopped because the sentence felt like it had missed its landing. \u201cBut there\u2019s something. The squeal is like\u2026 feedback. The sound going round and round finding itself and hating it. Maybe if I can\u2014 I don\u2019t know. Put a hand up to the right place.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the right place isn\u2019t your ear,\u201d she said, and then made a guilty face at her own cleverness. \u201cOkay, that was stupid. But what if it\u2019s the room? What if the room makes the noise worse or better, and we find the rooms that help.\u201d\n\n\u201cRooms as ear-shapes,\u201d I said, liking the idea more than I expected to. The museum had rooms that liked and disliked people in ways that were not polite. The hall with the life buoys whistled in some weathers and was a friend to nobody. The back wall by the seabirds kept secrets because that is what seabirds ask you to do, pretend you can fly and then keep it to yourself when you can\u2019t. \u201cWe can try after hours. We can ask the marlin nicely not to tattle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can bring the orange carrots and a thermos and some biscuits,\u201d she said, already making a list in her head with her mouth. \u201cWe can put a sign on the door that says Practising Quiet, which will make everyone angry even though it\u2019s reasonable. We can bring the metronome. We can\u2014 oh, I\u2019m bossing. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoss away,\u201d I said, because if anyone was going to make a plan that didn\u2019t end in blood or newspaper clippings it was her. \u201cI also want to try something stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a season of stupid,\u201d she said, but she was smiling with actual teeth. \u201cWhat stupid.\u201d\n\nI picked up one of her half-finished mugs from the shelf, the ones with the waves pressed into their sides that caught the light strange and made the tea behave like it had a mind to climb. The clay was chalky still, bisque-fired but not glazed, the sheen not yet in. I laid it on its side and then, feeling like the sort of magician nobody would pay money to see, I slid my left hand toward it and then into it as I did my breathing. The hiss rose to meet me with interest. The mug made the softest sound, like a thin bowl singing when you look at it too hard. The sleeve bunched; the bones of my hand did that not-being trick that still made my teeth tingle in sympathy even when I pretended I was fine.\n\nThe mug hummed again, barely there, a purr from an animal that had not known it could purr. It wasn\u2019t the screech. It wasn\u2019t the knife. It was a sound like somebody being spoken to from the other side of the wall by someone who intends kindness. I felt the invisible part of me push against the inside curve and the clay did not mind. It welcomed me the way water had welcomed a pebble when we were kids and still put things where they shouldn\u2019t go. I pulled back not because I was frightened but because there was a tenderness there I didn\u2019t want to bruise.\n\nMiri had put her ear down near it like a child, not touching, her scarf falling to the side in a soft collapse. \u201cIt sang,\u201d she said, and she didn\u2019t try to make the word better. \u201cYou made a cup sing without touching it with the side that touches. This is going to ruin me for regular ceramics. This is going to make me insufferable, actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t a model of sufferability before,\u201d I said, and we let the cups have their quiet and made ourselves tea in mugs that didn\u2019t want to be part of anything yet. The idea that clay was a kinder room than air to my not-hand was absurd and correct. If Nana\u2019s aids had squealed because the sound had nowhere useful to go, maybe mine needed a place that said, here, place it here, we can hold it and not be hurt.\n\nGraeme did not say yes to after-hours so much as not-notice that his keys were missing for long enough that we had the door open and ourselves inside. He had gone home early for once, muttering about his neighbour\u2019s hedge and the right to sunlight, and I did not feel guilty enough to stop. The building after dusk is a creature with a soft belly and bad eyes and a way of listening that you cannot buy. The life buoys were quiet. The marlin took its job as sentinel seriously, sorry about everything but not apologising. The anchor was a darkness pretending to be metal.\n\nWe put the metronome on the desk where Graeme pretended to write letters to the Board in longhand. We put the orange cones out like we were setting traps for silence, which in a way we were. Miri poured thermos tea and set a biscuit on a napkin she had probably ironed, because she is tragic in that way and I love her for it. We tucked plugs into ears and then took them out and agreed with our eyes not to talk for a bit and then put them back. The building breathed. When I went to the bird wall I could feel the shape of that breath, the way Older Places breathe in patterns people have forgotten to study.\n\nI tried there first because I am stubborn and because I had failed there last time. The hiss came in cooperative, the thread taut and pretty. I let the left hand go, courteous as we had practised, and then the wrist, and then the forearm, and the place where the shoulder begins. I didn\u2019t push. I didn\u2019t try to be a magician with a cape. I let it be as boring as a man doing a job well. The room did not punish me for good behaviour. It held me without asking questions and the squeal that had stabbed at the world before was like a mouse behind a wall being reasonable. Miri stood two short Miri-lengths away, hands in her pockets, rocking on her heels once in a while to tell me she was a metronome too.\n\nBeyond my own head\u2019s thin bright thread there was the building\u2019s hum, and beneath that a line so low I would not have heard it if I hadn\u2019t fallen half out of the usual world. It felt like the chain on the anchor had a note and it had been holding it since before the anchor had been lifted out of any water. I had been in here enough late nights to make that sentence sound like poetic nonsense, and still, it was there. It was a long held thing. It was a refusal to float off. It was the law the metal had made with itself when it was poured: you will bind and be bound, and in exchange you will sing very quietly to those who need it.\n\nI reached toward that in the way you reach for a light switch you can find in the dark with the heel of your hand. There was no flick, no flash, only a sense that something that had been waiting was no longer required to wait. The hiss in my head adjusted its coat. My shoulder did the thing it had been shy of doing in daylight and then more, the collar of my shirt half-limp where a body refused to be. I could feel the shape of me in the negative like a kid tracing her hand on paper and then colouring everything but the hand.\n\nThe marlin startled me by clacking against its mount with the softest clack and I had to laugh at myself because even not all here I reacted to a dead fish hanging like a sword on a wall. The laugh didn\u2019t tear the thread. The thread liked to vibrate. It was a string happy to be stroked, and when I thought that I felt something beside my own thinking brush back. As if there were another string in the room and it had said, hello, without words. It wasn\u2019t human. It wasn\u2019t not. It was like the breath the building had didn\u2019t end at the roofline and the city had its own breath and I had permission, for a second, to know it.\n\nA light on the far side by the lifts made a small alert beep because it was eight and it was wanting to tell someone they should have gone home. Miri flinched, a practical flinch, eyes flicking to the panel because she couldn\u2019t help but be in charge of situations we had invited in ourselves. I let the thread slacken and my shoulder came back in a wash this time, not a slap, and I bit the inside of my cheek because anything that makes you taste iron makes you feel like you are human again. My arm tingled in a million dots. My fingers remembered being attached with a rush that would have been obscene if it hadn\u2019t been relieved.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Miri said, and her mouth made the shape of a smile she restrained because she did not want to turn me into a trick even in her own head. \u201cOkay. Better. That was\u2026 you were half not-there, and you were breathing like a normal person in an ocean in his head. There was no screech, Eli. There was a pressure, and I can live with pressure. I cannot live with someone stabbing the inside of my ear with a knitting needle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recommend that either,\u201d I said, and tried to ignore the part of my mind that wanted a medal for doing something both absurd and not actively harmful to the public. The anchor did not move, obviously, because anchors are not for moving, but I could swear the chain lay slightly differently, as if it had sighed. \u201cThe anchor is my friend. I sound like a man who hugs trees, but I think the anchor likes the way I go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the anchor has a job and you make it feel like a star employee,\u201d she said, because she cannot help making things into people a little. She put her palm on the case, the respectful touch you give to something that would rather you didn\u2019t. \u201cWe can\u2019t always do it here, though. You can\u2019t live under the marlin. At some point we have to go to the supermarket and argue with the self-checkout.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say the word supermarket like that,\u201d I said, but I knew she was right. We had carved out a small pocket of workable in a building that had volunteered, in a sense, and the world outside was not going to bring us cups of tea every time I felt like becoming partial. Also, and this was ugly, I liked it. Not just the trick, but the feeling of my bones letting go of having to be bones all the time. There is a kind of joy in absence that you have to be careful with.\n\nWe tried the front hall for science because the front hall is a liar and pretends to be straightforward and then behaves like a funnel for any sound that wants to be a complaint. It was worse there. The squeal tried to get out like a mouse looking for a crack under a door. With the plugs in and Miri kind of sideways to me to make her smaller for it, we stopped it from becoming a problem quick. Without, even for a few seconds, the note wanted to make the lights flicker just to feel alive. It wasn\u2019t loud, not like before, but it made both of us grit our teeth and take the plugs as if they had been prescribed. We learned that lesson the way stubborn people learn; with our mouths tight and our eyes damp and a joke postponed for when we could stand upright again.\n\nBy the time we had recorded enough in our little non-notebook to satisfy her inner admin, it was late enough that the cleaner who hated us on principle because we dirtied the floors by walking had started on the bathrooms downstairs. We left a note for Graeme that said the vacuum cleaner is sulking, which was true because I had tripped over its cord and sworn at it in a way that made it weep. The wind outside had hauled itself up from the south just to remind everyone who lived here of their choices. The sky was not black so much as a deep, complicated blue. We walked home with our shoulders bent for rain that wasn\u2019t yet rain and could hear each other because we carried our quiet with us like a third person who didn\u2019t have opinions.\n\nAt the alley by the garages we both paused without meaning to. The chalk squares had ghosted themselves out, but there was a faint X left where some kid had marked treasure. A cat went past with the kind of disdain you have to be bred for. Miri looked at the dented bin and then at me and then at her own hands, the potter\u2019s hands with the places where clay had been inside the lines so long that the lines had made small hollows to welcome it. \u201cNot here,\u201d she said, and I didn\u2019t need the rest because the place had ears and we had learned some things that day about what to do and what to not do.\n\nWe slept inside our own rooms with the doors nearly shut, which was as close to privacy as the flat allowed. I lay with the hiss as if it were a dog I had adopted and was waiting to see if it would bite. It yawned in my head and let me scratch it behind the ears with my counting. When we were kids and the night was a black pond, Nana would sometimes leave her aids on by accident and the whine would go all the way through a dream and into morning, a thin measure of time that lived by itself. I hadn\u2019t thought of that in years. How you could hear a person\u2019s presence because of what they couldn\u2019t hear. How the things we think are our faults turn into lanterns in other rooms.\n\nIn the morning the world did that mean trick where it behaves normally to see if you\u2019ll relax. Toast that jumped when it wanted to. Shoes that had hidden themselves like they had a personality. Miri had her market again and her sign that said Handmade by a Person, which made me snort every time because who else was making sweet potato-coloured mugs in Wellington, actual dolphins. She put a pair of plugs in a tiny tin and clipped it to her keys as if they were medicine, because for her they were, now that my inside noise had learned to put on an outside coat now and then.\n\nAt work I took myself small. I pretended to love the anchor less. I made eye contact with the kids and rewarded them for not touching the ship in the bottle with stickers that said I Kept My Hands To Myself, which is a weird sentence to give to a child. I didn\u2019t go to the bird wall even though it had been kind. I went to the back room with the boxes that smell like old wood and older salt, and I did the saddest thing I have done so far, which is I put the orange cones in my pocket and did not tell anyone why my jeans had a lump.\n\nThe woman with the sunhat did not come back, because why would she, but a man who had once worked the ferries came in and stood with his hands behind his back like he had forgotten what it was like to have them free. He didn\u2019t speak right away and then when he did he told me about a time the fog came in like God had asked for privacy, and how they had to measure the passage between the buoys with their breath because the instruments fussed. \u201cWe used to whistle at the foghorn just to feel smaller,\u201d he said, and he laughed at his own young self in a way that was affectionate and a little disgusted. I liked him intensely for four minutes and then he wandered away to be sad by the life buoys because they are a good place for that.\n\nAt lunch I sat in the staff room and looked at the poster about other people\u2019s lunches and did a very odd thing. I cupped my right hand over my right ear the way Nana had done and gave the world permission to be quiet for a count of eight. It didn\u2019t obey because it never does, but something about the cup against the bone changed the hiss\u2019s coat again. It rounded a fraction. It hesitated. It didn\u2019t want to go into feedback, which is what I was learning to call the outside knife. It wanted to be line, and lines are the kinder shape.\n\nI told Miri in the evening about cupping my ear and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to end up with one enormous forearm like a tennis player,\u201d because she refuses to be solemn longer than is strictly required for the maintenance of human relationships. Then she pulled her earplugs out of their tin and put them in, and we sat on the couch and watched a terrible television show with the sound off and invented better dialogue for all the characters. It\u2019s a trick to be a person and also be the person who is sometimes less, and that trick felt almost possible in that moment.\n\nWe didn\u2019t see the woman with the sunhat again, but two days later a postcard came to the museum addressed To The Man By The Birds and nobody laughed, which is a small miracle. It had a picture of the harbour from a stupid angle and on the back, in that rounded careful handwriting women develop when they\u2019re trying not to be themselves, she had written one sentence and then another. The first was, I am sorry for looking like that, and the second was, I heard a sound that reminded me of a dentist and I was brave anyway later in the day and ate a pear. Graeme passed it to me with two fingers like it might bite and I put it in my pocket as if it were heavy. After work I took it home and put it under the fridge magnet shaped like a long white cloud because we are cheap and obvious and couldn\u2019t be more pleased with ourselves.\n\nThe smart thing about the postcard was not the apology. It was the pear. The pear meant she had survived the sound and chosen sweetness anyway. The pear meant people bend and then they do ordinary acts to prove to themselves they have not broken. I stood in the kitchen with a pear of my own because the dairy had them and I am a tragic for signs. I ate it over the sink because I never use a plate if I can help it and the juice ran and the hiss in my head hummed and I did not vanish and the wind did its Wellington thing against the window and I thought, no, okay, maybe not a storm. Maybe something like weather, but in the small way, the way that lets you hang washing and take it in before it breaks you.\n\nThat night the ferry blew its horn twice and then once again, a pattern it doesn\u2019t often do, and I counted without trying because counting is how my head shapes things it can\u2019t otherwise hold. Somewhere far away, in a house that was not mine, a woman with a sunhat sat at a table and wrote a second card she would or wouldn\u2019t send. Somewhere in our flat, in the room with the half-moons of threw clay on the floor, Miri put orange cones in a tin and then in a bag because she is the sort of person who likes a bag inside a bag, and then she lay down and slept with one ear tuned in case my breath got itself into trouble.\n\nA week later Jace rang and didn\u2019t say hello, he just said, \u201cCome by the shop after six, I want to show you a thing,\u201d and then hung up because his whole life is leaving. I went because value for value and because he loved me in that way he said he did, the way that doesn\u2019t ask. The shop smelled of rubber and oil and men making the mistake of thinking they can outwit physics with their hands. He had a piece of chain in his hand, not fancy, a length of what had been a lock if you believed the label. He pressed it into my palm like he was a priest and I was a man who\u2019d done a terrible thing and was getting a small object to remind me not to do it again. \u201cFor your pocket,\u201d he said, not looking at me long. \u201cKeep you here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chain,\u201d I said, and he nodded like he liked that I knew what a chain was.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weight,\u201d he said, which is not the same thing and what he meant. He tightened a bolt on a child\u2019s bike and didn\u2019t ask and I didn\u2019t tell and I walked out into the wind with the stupid piece of chain in my pocket clinking against my keys and it was ridiculous and perfect. On the way home I walked past the place in the alley where the chalk had tried and failed to stay and I touched the chain and put my hand in my pocket and let the hiss be a line and did not go anywhere at all.\n\nThat was the day I started thinking, properly, not like a coward, about Nana\u2019s funeral and the way the minister\u2019s microphone had squealed when he got it too close to the speaker and how he had smiled and said, sorry folks, old friend, and then moved it two inches and the squeal had gone as if it had taken offence. The solution had been insultingly simple in the end. These things sometimes are. You move the thing away from the thing. You make a gap. You change the angle. You give the sound somewhere else to go. The trick is to do it without only half living. The trick is to become gap when you mean it and be solid when you mean that too.\n\nAll of which would have been noble and useful and maybe even a method if the next thing hadn\u2019t happened, which was that the power went out in the middle of a school tour and the emergency lights didn\u2019t come on and someone screamed because people scream when they can\u2019t find the edges of themselves. The storm had been practising all week at the far end of the strait. It had decided, in that arbitrary way storms do, that we were now interesting. The kids were playing with a display they weren\u2019t allowed to play with and the teacher had a face that asked for a break she would not get. The lights died like they had been shot one by one while standing in a row. Silence fell and then surged, because silence is not nothing, it\u2019s something that observes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d I heard myself say, which is a stupid sentence because you never do, and out of the dim I felt Miri\u2019s hand hook into my sleeve because she had come by to bring me a sandwich and an opinion, and then there were children and sea birds and the suggestion of an anchor and the hiss like a wire you could tune, and I thought, right, okay, then, and counted to six and held for two and not for much longer than that, because if you are going to be a person who steps sideways to help you have to remember the door back is always at least half locked.I said it like a man in a film who knows where the torch is, and then of course I didn\u2019t know where the torch was. The power went out all at once, a curtain drop, not the stuttery kind that gives you time to make wishes. The seabirds went from specimens to silhouettes. Someone\u2019s phone made a small, startled chime and then died because phones are cowards. The teacher made the first sound after the dark, that thin strained \u201cOkay,\u201d you give a crowd when you\u2019re asking your own ribs to behave. I felt Miri\u2019s hand find my sleeve and hook there, a practical tether. Her fingers made an anchor of cloth. I squeezed back and took a breath that didn\u2019t belong to me and borrowed it anyway.\n\n\u201cHands on your buddy\u2019s shoulders,\u201d I said into the dark, projecting the way Jace does when he\u2019s trying to get a bar to hush without buying them another round. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a slow snake. No rushing. We\u2019re safe. You\u2019re with us.\u201d My voice was too calm. Fake calm is still better than the other kind. I could smell wet wool and lunchbox apples. A kid made a noise that wasn\u2019t crying exactly, a high leak of air that was on its way to being that. \u201cHey, mate,\u201d I said, and didn\u2019t say the part about how I\u2019d felt like that all week and survived it. \u201cHear that? The ferry\u2019s going to sing for us. We\u2019re going to sing back by walking.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the ferry that answered. It was the other note, the low line I\u2019d found under the museum like a seam. I had no right to ask it for anything and did anyway. I slid my left hand toward the anchor in the dark, knowing the room\u2019s shape without seeing because I\u2019d spent too many nights there to be a stranger. The hiss in my head tightened like a string when you twist the peg just enough and not one turn more. I didn\u2019t go. Not fully. I let my fingers thin, enough to slip into the chain\u2019s idea of itself, and then I plucked without plucking. Metal remembers being liquid; it also remembers being asked to hold. The chain answered with a note you don\u2019t exactly hear with your ears. It\u2019s a bone sound. It\u2019s a sound you feel in your wrist and your teeth and the place under your throat where your breath queues up.\n\nThe children went quiet in a way that had nothing to do with me being heroic. It was animal. Something big hummed and their bodies, which are smarter than their teachers about danger, leaned into it. \u201cFollow the quiet song,\u201d I said, because I didn\u2019t know how to say follow the thing that keeps ships alive. \u201cWe\u2019re headed to the front. Miri, you\u2019ve got the tail?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the tail,\u201d she said, and her voice was the voice of all the aunties, all the bosses. \u201cMiss? You and I can be outboard. Hands on little shoulders. You too, mate. Don\u2019t you go pretending you\u2019re above it.\u201d She had a kid by the collar and the kid made a huffy noise that meant obedience disguised as reluctance.\n\n\u201cWhat about the torches?\u201d the teacher asked, managing courtesy in a dark that wanted no part of it.\n\n\u201cOn it,\u201d I said, lying in the way that saves lives. I let the chain keep talking to the room. It thrummed very politely, like a bass player who knows the gig isn\u2019t theirs, and I took my hand back before my shoulder could be tempted to make a bigger poor decision. I cupped my right ear like Nana and the hiss rounded itself, a coin sanded at the edges, then I went for Graeme\u2019s cupboard behind the marlin, because if he hides anything useful it\u2019s behind the dead fish with the resigned expression.\n\nIn the blackout the marlin was a rumour at head level. I whispered \u201csorry\u201d to it because I am that kind of man and then banged my knee on the chair designed for a child with a grudge. The office door was sticky, a late-century door that thought it was a secret. I used my shoulder because you use what you have. Inside, the air smelled like paper going stale. I ran my hands along the shelf where the torches used to be, found nothing but forms and a spider that could have started its own union, and then saw the red glow of the keys cabinet, except the glow was a trick my eyes were playing because it was dark enough to invent glowing. The cabinet was locked. Of course it was. Graeme trusts locks the way some people trust saints.\n\nI had the length of chain in my pocket because I hadn\u2019t taken it out since Jace pressed it on me like a blessing. It knocked against my thigh now with a small, hardworking clink. I wrapped it once around my wrist, stupid superstition or good sense, and took one breath like a liar. The hiss went fine and tight. I didn\u2019t close my eyes because there was no point. I thinned my left hand inside my own sleeve and slid it through the cheap metal box the way a fish slides through a shadow. It felt like pushing into a story you weren\u2019t completely invited to. The key ring was easy: big plastic tags, the kind you buy in packs and never label properly. I curled ghost fingers around a likely one and pulled gently so I wouldn\u2019t hook the whole lot and announce my tricks to the marlin. The key came out like a coin from behind an uncle\u2019s ear. My breath stuttered, the squeal pressed for a moment at the edge of the room, thin knife testing the butter, and I cupped my ear with my right hand and lowered my head until the note thought better of it and went sulk in a corner.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d I said to the fish, to the cupboard, to my heart which was punting. Out at the seabirds, the chain\u2019s hum continued in a way that made me feel disloyal for having left it with a job. I unlocked the second cabinet, the one where Graeme keeps things he calls plant as if that will make them thrive. Torches, two of them, old but not dead. I smacked their bottoms like a man who does not believe in subtlety and they stuttered into cones of yellow. I took them and the key back to the dark.\n\nIn the dim, the museum was a cave with pictures of boats. The kids were a little river of backs. Miri had the last one by the collar still and the teacher had found her spine. \u201cSlow,\u201d she said in that school voice that is not a request. \u201cHands and eyes.\u201d I put a torch in her hand and one in Miri\u2019s and the relief that rolled through the little procession was bigger than the cones of light could justify. People will forgive almost anything if you hand them a tool.\n\n\u201cWhat about the door?\u201d someone said, because someone always says what about the door. The front was up a short flight and then through the foyer everyone thinks is a different building because of the tiles. In a blackout the automatic thing is to assume things are automatic. They weren\u2019t. The door was a heavy thing that wanted power and we had none to offer. I moved ahead and put my shoulder against it like it had insulted my wh\u0101nau. It gave grudgingly, a grumpy old man of a door. I told it to behave in the tone my stepfather used on dogs. It behaved just enough. A slice of day came in, slate-coloured and wet. The storm had rolled over the hill and parked on us with its handbrake up. Wind came at us like a thing that wanted to make a point.\n\n\u201cOn the count of three,\u201d I said to the teacher, because ceremony helps. \u201cOne, two\u2014\u201d and we pushed on two because three is for amateurs. The door opened enough to let a class snake though. The outside wasn\u2019t light exactly but it was not dark. In the doorway the wind made a noise like a woman with opinions. The parents with lunches were dots on the far side of the square. Someone from the ferry office was waving. The kids went out, counting themselves without being asked, \u201cone-two, one-two,\u201d the way they\u2019d been taught to cross streets and decades and rooms full of men. When the last little shoulder passed me I had that feeling I sometimes get that my job is actually to be the place people go around.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can get the emergency lights to\u2026 remember their job,\u201d I told Miri, because if I said fix I\u2019d jinx it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be noble,\u201d she said, not unkind. \u201cBe quick.\u201d\n\nI went back into the cave with the smaller torch chalking the air, thinking about everything I don\u2019t know about electricity and whether you can get electrocuted if the part of you doing the foolish thing is less than here. I promised myself that if there were any buzzing I would stop. I walked past the anchor and it hummed once like a person saying my name from another room and I touched the case as if patting a dog who\u2019d done well. The marlin watched me with its permanent death-face. The breaker box was in the staff corridor by the sink that never drains because old buildings like to keep a little of what you give them. The panel had a flap with a sticker that said Qualified Personnel Only which is a sentence that covers a lot of sins. I opened it anyway. Inside it was arranged in that bureaucratic logic that makes sense to someone somewhere. A line of switches. One heavy lever that said Generator, as if saying the name summoned the thing. The little stop-start button that had been bumped by a mopping bucket once and caused more excitement than any exhibition we\u2019d had that year. The emergency light circuit had tripped. It had that tiny look of guilt switches get when they\u2019ve done the wrong thing entirely in your absence.\n\nI put the chain into my palm again because the weight mattered. I put one earplug in with my mouth because my hands were shaking and my mouth fancied itself a helper. I hesitated for exactly the right amount of time to think of every person I love asking me not to be stupid, and then flipped the emergency line back. The panel made a polite click and the corridor did that hopeful glow that means batteries have remembered what they are for. Back in the gallery, above the seabirds, a thin rectangle lit like a cartoon. Not enough to make ships out of shadows. Enough to keep people from turning to ghosts.\n\nThe generator lever dared me. I didn\u2019t take the dare. The wind outside sounded like it could power a small town if you could get it to behave. I left the main as it was because sometimes leaving things alone is a skill. On the way back through the hall, the PA system hiccuped once and tried to clear its throat. Somewhere the radio upstairs that Graeme listens to when he says he\u2019s thinking attempted a static. The knife-squeal sniffed at the room like a rat. I cupped my ear and lowered my head and it passed, a small sharp thing that decided we weren\u2019t worth the trouble today.\n\nOut front the teacher had her hands full of thanks and stray children. Miri handed me half a sandwich she had meant for me anyway. Graeme appeared from somewhere like a man who has always been here and just forgot to tell you. His hair was at attention. His glasses were fogged. He looked around for someone to blame and found me, which is a talent. \u201cIncident report,\u201d he said, as if that were the first thing a person should say in a blackout in a storm with a class outside and the emergency lights now doing a creditable job. \u201cEverybody in staff room. After the\u2026 after.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got them out,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t say the anchor sang because there are limits to what a man can get away with under fluorescent light.\n\nHe took his glasses off and back on and couldn\u2019t find the sentence he wanted to use to be angry at me for not being at fault. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, and that one syllable did a lot of work. \u201cWell. Thank you. And also incident report.\u201d He shuffled away to find paper or a culprit.\n\nThe class teacher squeezed my arm like she was checking a melon at the market. \u201cYou were calm,\u201d she said. \u201cI appreciate calm. And the\u2026 sound. I don\u2019t know what that was. But thanks.\u201d She was about to ask me if that sound was part of the exhibition and then she saw my face and didn\u2019t. She took her small humans into the weather with a competence that made me want to sit down.\n\nMiri and I stood under the enormous overhang where the rain couldn\u2019t quite get us and shared the sandwich like we had invented hunger. The wind came in sideways and then the other sideways to make sure it had covered all angles. The ghost hum from the chain was still in my bones; I watched the rain hit the lip of the harbour and break and braid itself because water is better at choreography than people are. \u201cYou good?\u201d Miri asked around a mouthful of bread because she is an animal sometimes.\n\n\u201cI did a crime against electricity,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it was petty.\u201d\n\n\u201cPetty crimes save more people than grand ones,\u201d she said, and took the last bite meanly. \u201cMy ear\u2019s fine. It didn\u2019t do the needle. It did that thing where it thinks it\u2019s inside a shell. Manageable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get good at this,\u201d I said, and as soon as I said it the world put on its hat with the word hubris on it and we both knocked on the wooden bench without meaning to.\n\nThe incident report was a ritual dance in which you agree that everything happens in a straight line and is the result of choices that can be catalogued. I wrote sentences like Power cut at approximately 11:58 and Staff member retrieved torches and Assisted evacuation as if the building did not breathe and the anchor did not hold me in place with a hum. Graeme wrote his own version with the word protocol in it twice and the words staff conduct once, and I took that like a person takes weather. When it came to the bit about the emergency lights, he allowed, grudgingly, \u201cGood initiative,\u201d and made it sound like a diagnosis.\n\nBy the time the worst of the dark was over, the worst of the day wasn\u2019t. The storm sat and sulked on us all afternoon, tapping the windows like it had brought us a shameful amount of rain and wanted to be thanked. The generator finally decided to play its part with a cough that ran up the ducting and made the marlin look like it was trying to remember an old joke. We let the school groups be cancelled by someone else\u2019s email and kept the door half shut and told tourists gentle lies about flood risk. I went and stood by the anchor when nobody was looking and put my palm against the case again. \u201cCheers,\u201d I said to it quietly. \u201cI owe you something I don\u2019t know the name of.\u201d\n\nAt home the power had done that Wellington thing where it gives up on the suburbs it doesn\u2019t love and then changes its mind without apologising. The lights in our little street were on. Inside, the clocks blinked a time they didn\u2019t believe in and Miri lit the gas with a lighter held like a ritual. She set the orange cones down in their tin and looked at them as if they were sweets she shouldn\u2019t eat. \u201cI needed them less today,\u201d she said, proud and annoyed.\n\n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d I said, and the chain in my pocket had enough weight to make me stand up straighter. I set it on the hook by the door where we hang our keys, like a joke that had taken up a job. It looked silly. It looked right. I\u2019m learning those two things are often the same.\n\nSleep that night was the kind you pay for with a price you haven\u2019t quite counted. In my dreams the building had a voice that wasn\u2019t a hum anymore. It was a person with a very low voice telling me not to be afraid of being less. In the dream I nodded like a good student and then in the morning I wanted to argue, because being less, in day, has consequences that feel like you have to make tea for them. I sat at the table with a pear because of the postcard and a pen because of the incident report and watched juice drip onto the paper I wasn\u2019t writing on. \u201cDo you think this is\u2026 replicable?\u201d I asked Miri, who had clay in her hair and clay under her nails and a clay eye on me.\n\n\u201cWhat, you and your anchor and your choir of lights?\u201d she asked, amused enough that I didn\u2019t bristle. \u201cWe can find places that want to hold us. Rooms are ear-shapes, remember? There will be rooms that make you feel like a kettle and rooms that make you feel like a bass drum and rooms that make you feel like the space under a bed. We just have to learn the map.\u201d\n\nWe made a list because she is the sort of person who gets a glittering in her eyes when a list is required. The band rotunda down by Oriental\u2014the one that pretends to be new but is, at its heart, a circle for sound. The National Library reading room, if the security guard who looks like he regrets every choice he ever made lets us in long enough to feel the wood. The tunnel under Mt Vic, which is the wrong place for a lot of reasons, but people toot in it because otherwise they feel like they\u2019ve disappeared, and I was curious to learn whether I would love it or be made into mince by it. The church up the hill that nobody we know goes to but everyone thinks of when they think of quiet. Not to be disrespectful. To see what stone does with me when I am the size of a careful breath.\n\nWe started with the rotunda because it seemed least likely to end with us being told off by a man in a hi-vis vest. The wind was having a quieter day, still opinionated but less inclined to slap. The circle held our small sound in its hands and passed it round like bread. I stood at the centre and made myself not try, which is like telling a toddler not to drop anything. The hiss found the curve as if it had been looking for it. My left hand let go and there was no knife in the air, there was only a thin shimmering like heat on a road. The sound we didn\u2019t make made a neighbour for the sound of water on pilings. A jogger went through and didn\u2019t side-eye us because joggers have kingdoms you can\u2019t enter. A couple with chips sat outside and gave us a look that was friendly and decided we were buskers who hadn\u2019t committed yet. Miri made a tiny recording on her phone, not of the sound\u2014there wasn\u2019t much to catch\u2014but of the absence, the way the room\u2019s breath altered. Later she played it back and we both felt nothing and said \u201cweird\u201d and then laughed because trying to prove this to anybody at all would make us insufferable.\n\nThe tunnel was a mistake we made softly. We went on foot at a time of day drivers weren\u2019t all doing their Mt Vic toot-toot like it kept the freeway gods on side. The walls held their own damp. The tiles made their own echo of everyone who\u2019d sung the first bar of any song they thought matched the shape. I stuck a plug in just in case and took a breath and immediately felt the hiss try to go up and up like a balloon someone had let go of. \u201cNah,\u201d I said out loud to it, which made Miri snort, and we walked out into air and agreed that the tunnel is for car horns and mourners and people who like to hear themselves sure. Not for us.\n\nThe church surprised me. I thought stone would press me flat like a teacher\u2019s hand and say, that will do. The brass plaque at the door asked for silence like it was a tithe. We did the kid thing where you look at sainthood in windows and try not to compare it to anyone you know. In there my head did not make the bright thin line; it made a line you could hold. I didn\u2019t try to go because I am not a complete fool. I let the breath make a shape and then another and waited until the fierce part of me, the one that wants always to step, sat down and accepted a biscuit it didn\u2019t deserve. The old wooden pew had a note I could feel with my shoulder-blades. Later, on the steps, Miri said, \u201cThat was like Nana\u2019s living room if Nana had had a cathedral,\u201d and I said, \u201cAnd nobody made us fill in a form,\u201d and we both agreed not to be religious about it because life is hard enough.\n\nThe National Library was a no because the man at the desk had a face on him. We went into the atrium and stood near the Zealandia display because the takah\u0113 was there in poster form, and I tried a breath and got a spurt of squeal so fast and small it barely left my skull. \u201cNope,\u201d I said, and we went and got coffee from a truck and named birds we couldn\u2019t see instead.\n\nBack at the flat, Miri\u2019s mugs began to change shape without her asking them to. She started making little notches near the rim, meaningless if you looked, but when you blew across them with your mouth half a song they made a note like a reassurance. She pretended for a day or two it was an accident and then confessed. \u201cMy hands aren\u2019t interested in regular rounds anymore,\u201d she said, vexed but pleased. \u201cI\u2019m making rooms for your ridiculousness. I\u2019m going to be intolerable at the market, Eli.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be insufferable and rich,\u201d I said, which is the good kind of intolerable if you share. She began drilling tiny holes in handles and looking at me out of the corner of her eye for permission she didn\u2019t need. The mugs whistled if you put them down too hard. It should have been annoying. It was a house full of small anchors.\n\nGraeme, to my profound shock, did not call a meeting to discuss my behaviour. He printed out the incident report and put it in a folder and labelled the folder INCIDENTS and put it in the drawer you can\u2019t open without swearing. He did buy three new torches and lock them in a cabinet I now had the key to because I\u2019d rescued him once. He made a point, quietly, of telling me which staff were on inhalers and which child in the brochure photo had sensory issues so if we lost the lights again we did not lose our people. \u201cProtocols,\u201d he said, pretending not to be kind, and I said \u201cYeah,\u201d pretending not to be moved.\n\nA week of ordinary passed, which here means wind and coffee and three tourists asking where the earthquake house is. I didn\u2019t go in alleys and disappear on purpose. I worked, I counted, I put the chain in my pocket and took it out and placed it by the door like a talisman with grease on it. I tried once in the back room with the boxes just to see if the cardboard wanted me. It didn\u2019t. It made a papery fuss and then a spider asserted squatter\u2019s rights on my boot and I apologised to it for stepping there. The hiss and I had what I would call a truce. I didn\u2019t make it do party tricks if it didn\u2019t stab me. We were, for five days, a man and his unwanted but no longer entirely hostile guest.\n\nThen the weather, being itself, remembered we exist. The storm that had parked its one-tonne weight over Cook Strait rolled off and made room for all the people with kites. The sun came through the museum glass like a judgement. A family of five came in, the sort that looks like a magazine ad if the magazine is about sensible shoes. The youngest was a small person with the gaze of a god, three maybe, held together by a cardigan with sheep on it. She toddled to the anchor with that alarming dignity toddlers have and put both palms against the case. \u201cHello,\u201d she said to it, and I nearly cried because we never grow out of that, we just forget to do it out loud.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch,\u201d her mother said, not looking up from her phone, and the girl frowned and said, \u201cRude,\u201d and I went and cleaned a smudge that wasn\u2019t there so I could stand near a person being correct without being paid for it. The anchor thrummed once, as if in reply. So soft I wanted to claim I\u2019d imagined it. The little girl nodded like a woman hearing gossip she already knew. Sometimes the city offers you a piece of itself and expects you to have the manners to take it without making announcements.\n\nThe next thing that really happened wasn\u2019t about museums at all. It was about buses and their tendency to be barrels with wheels. I was on one, the No. 2 because the No. 1 had betrayed me by being early two days in a row, and we were up by the tunnel corner where everyone either honks or wonders what the honking\u2019s about. The driver braked hard to avoid a cyclist with a death wish or a god on his shoulder, and a woman in the front grabbed the pole and missed and did that graceless stagger we all dread. I went to grab her with my good manners and my ordinary body, and in the jerk of the bus my left hand went without meaning to. Not far. Enough that when my fingers found her elbow I felt it like you feel the side of a balloon. My palm fizzed. The woman looked at me because even if you don\u2019t see the trick your body knows when you\u2019ve been touched by weather and not by skin. For one horrible second I thought she was going to do the sunhat woman\u2019s look. She didn\u2019t. She said, \u201cThanks, love,\u201d in a Christchurch voice, and sat, and the bus went on with its mind humming about schedules.\n\nI sat too and stared at my hand like it was a child who\u2019d run into the street. The hiss in my head tried to be helpful and wasn\u2019t. The piece of chain in my pocket knocked lightly as if to say, I can\u2019t do everything for you. The bus went into the tunnel and everyone tooted except the driver, who is a professional and knows better. The sound cupped us and let us go. I breathed and counted and didn\u2019t move and the woman with the near-fall took a lolly out of her bag and unwrapped it with the careful relish of people who understand small sweetnesses.\n\nAt home I told Miri about the bus and she chewed the inside of her cheek until it let go of her. \u201cSo it wants you when you don\u2019t want it,\u201d she said, which is just bodies. \u201cMaybe your hand\u2019s learning your life without asking permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be consulted,\u201d I said, nettled and tired.\n\n\u201cSo would most of us about most of what our hands do,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay. New rule. Chain on the bus. Earplug in the left ear in public if you can stand it. And\u2014I can make you something.\u201d She went into her cupboard of horrors and came out with a strip of clay, half-dry, shaped like a thin cuff. \u201cLike a bangle but you won\u2019t look like a surfer. A band. With holes. If you slip towards gone and you\u2019re touching it, it\u2019ll sing. You\u2019ll know. I\u2019ll drill the tiny whistles. Your hand will have to pay attention to you to make the noise stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re giving my hand a time-out bracelet,\u201d I said, and felt ridiculous gratitude work its way up like a blush. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the weirdest people at the bus stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even close,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been to Kilbirnie on a Sunday. Please.\u201d She made a face at the clay like a parent with a bright child who will not sleep. \u201cAlso, if you hate it we can pretend it was an art school assignment I failed.\u201d\n\nShe fired it ugly and useful on purpose so nobody would ask if it was for sale. It looked like a bit of drainpipe with ideas. It fit. When I slid my fingers along it you could feel the air want to be something, like the room before a song. When I let my hand go a fraction in the kitchen with the jug boiling and the cat who stares like Miri owes it money on the windowsill to remind us it knows the window, the cuff made a little bird noise and I laughed so hard I had to sit down. It was ridiculous. It was practical. It was ours.\n\n\u201cYou are not a storm,\u201d she said that night when the ferry made its odd pattern again and we counted without meaning to. \u201cStop calling yourself weather. You\u2019re a man. Who does a thing. Sometimes. With rules. And carrots.\u201d She tapped the tin with the earplugs. \u201cWe are making rules. We are buying vegetables. We are not having an apocalypse.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall apocalypses,\u201d I said, because I couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cOne-room apocalypses. The kind you can clean up with a damp cloth.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d she said, fond and bossy, and I did, and for the first time since the hiss arrived at my particular shoreline I slept like a person who had chosen his own bed.\n\nIn the morning a letter was waiting that had a Te Papa stamp in the corner, which made me suspect Graeme had enemies he hadn\u2019t told me about. It wasn\u2019t that. It was from a conservator there I half-knew from the meetings where small museums learn how to be more boring safely. She wrote like a woman who edits herself, everything neat. She had heard \u201cthrough channels\u201d that our emergency lights were unreliable and that we had \u201cmanaged admirably\u201d (her phrase; I looked twice) in the dark. If we needed to borrow battery lanterns in the interim, she had a cupboard full and a soft spot for people who had to work near anchors. At the bottom she had added a line in a different pen. Do you ever get that high note? I do. Thought I was mad. Not a trick question. No rush.\n\nI put the letter under the long white cloud magnet because that is what we do with omen mail now, and I stood very still in the kitchen while the jug clicked off by itself. Miri came in with clay on her shin in the shape of a crescent and read the fine print without me offering. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, which is our family\u2019s favourite word for a door. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\nWe had thought we were the only people in Wellington listening to a fence in the sky. We might not be. I put my finger on the strip of different ink and tapped twice like the inside of my skull when the lights go out. The house made that small pop houses make when they\u2019ve decided not to fall down for another day. The wind found the bathroom vent and sang there for a second because it refuses to be left out. I breathed the way a person breathes when his world has just widened by an inch and the inch is a thousand kilometres long. I wasn\u2019t ready to answer her. But I folded the letter neat and put it in my pocket with the chain because belonging, it turns out, comes in absurd forms.\n\nThe day after that the sea threw back at us a container the colour of a bruise, and I watched three men in a truck try to argue the laws of hydrodynamics into letting them fetch it and lost my way to the right floor cleaner because all the physics in my life were suddenly in the same room. The anchor hummed at me twice without reason. A kid pressed both her palms to the glass and said hello. I cupped my ear. The hiss behaved. I didn\u2019t go. I didn\u2019t vanish. I stayed. It was, after all, a weekday. People expect certain things. I wrote a reply to the conservator on paper because that seemed right. I wrote maybe and then crossed it out and wrote yes and folded it too small. I posted it in the box on the corner that never quite swallows letters on the first try, and went back to the museum and my mop and my anchor and the building\u2019s breath, and every time the ferry blew its horn in that pattern we were learning I breathed and counted and didn\u2019t call it a sign in case it heard me and decided to have opinions.Kiri wrote back before the letter could get used to being in my pocket. It was a card with a woodcut of a shag on weathered paper, the sort of thing that looks humble and costs triple. Her handwriting was the same tidy channel she\u2019d used before, light pressure like she didn\u2019t want to bruise the paper. Yes, she wrote. Yes to the note, yes to thinking you\u2019re mad, yes to the way rooms behave like complicated instruments. She suggested coffee at the museum caf\u00e9 at ten on Thursday, the one with the muffins that disintegrate and the barista who looks like he\u2019s forgiven nobody for ordering decaf. \u201cIf you want the lanterns, I\u2019ll bring the key. If you want to talk about the sound, we can sit and pretend to be discussing loan agreements,\u201d she wrote, and added under that, small, \u201cI\u2019d appreciate not being mad on my own.\u201d\n\nMiri read it with her chin on my shoulder and a smear of blue on her forearm from a glaze she was pretending not to like. \u201cShe\u2019s careful,\u201d she said, pleased in the way you\u2019re pleased when someone else knows how to walk on thin ice without pointing at it. \u201cWe like careful. Don\u2019t go alone. I\u2019ll pretend to be interested in a dinosaur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong museum,\u201d I said, and she flicked my ear with the corner of the card because she refuses to be corrected by me even when I\u2019m right.\n\nWe walked down on the morning she\u2019d named, wind in its better mood and the sky doing that pale, hard blue it saves for days it thinks it can get away with. I wore the clay cuff, the little whistles drilled by Miri to make my hand susceptible to embarrassment. The chain lived in my pocket with a spare earplug and a stick of gum that had seen better centuries. Miri had tied her scarf in a way that made strangers think she was a person inspectors might ask for a permit. At the threshold of the big museum I felt both loyal and adulterous. Our little place near the port had its anchor and its breath. This big place had its own plans and its own giants.\n\nKiri was the easier kind of precise. She sat at the edge of the caf\u00e9 like she wanted to be near the door but not look like she wanted to be near the door, glasses on a chain that made its own tiny clink against a ceramic cup. She wore a cardigan that had been patched by someone who liked to patch. When she looked up and saw us, her face did not do surprise. It did recognition like we were coming back from a longer walk than she had expected us to take. \u201cEli,\u201d she said, and then, to Miri, \u201cAnd you\u2019ve brought backup, which is very sensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my sister Miri,\u201d I said, not explaining the steps of the staircase that made that true. \u201cShe\u2019s the kind of person who carries spare earplugs and snacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get on,\u201d Kiri said, as if she collected such people. She pushed a plate of muffins our way like an offering that did not commit her to anything. Up close, the carefulness in her moved like a person who doesn\u2019t want to knock a table full of borrowed things. Her voice was low, unadvertised. \u201cBefore we do the closet full of lights and health and safety, can we talk about the note without any of us staring directly at it?\u201d\n\nWe talked around it like a fire we were all slightly superstitious of. She called it a line in her head, not loud, not constant, coaxed by quiet rooms and that particular dead air that happens before rain. It was higher at night and lower by big cold machines. When she had to sit in the textiles room with the humidifiers sulking, it wove itself underneath the whine like a thread. \u201cIn the print store it\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, as if she were apologising to a friend. \u201cPaper has good manners. In the stone store\u2026 it loves stone. The columns under here, the piles in the sea, whatever all of this sits on. It\u2019s as if the line stands up straight when it feels weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeight helps,\u201d I said, my thumb worrying the edge of the silly clay cuff as if it were a rosary. \u201cI have a piece of chain that keeps me in my chair. I sound like a dog. But\u2014weight. And rooms. And earplugs.\u201d\n\nMiri watched us with that tilted attention that made people confess things they hadn\u2019t meant to say out loud. \u201cWe think of it like feedback,\u201d she offered. \u201cLike Nana\u2019s hearing aids used to do at church. His squeal is the bad bit. The line is the bit he can be friends with, if the room lets it be a line and not a knife. The anchor helps. Clay helps. Metal helps. The front hall doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKiri nodded. \u201cCavities and edges,\u201d she said, relieved to have a phrase that made sense to her mouth. \u201cAnd yes to feedback. My grandfather\u2019s radio used to do it. He\u2019d put his hand on the cabinet, like he could pet the noise, and it would behave. When I walk past the air-handling units upstairs I can feel what it\u2019s going to be before it is. It makes me think I\u2019ve got a dog nose, which would be funny if it didn\u2019t keep me up at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it\u2014\u201d I started, and then stopped because the word I had about myself was not the right word to hand to someone else. \u201cDoes it do anything to your\u2026 being there. Does it pull at you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t\u2026 untie me,\u201d she said, picking her words like fruit she meant to put back if it bruised. \u201cNot the way you\u2019re hinting at. It pulls my attention until I can\u2019t hear anyone talking. It makes me stand with my hand on a pillar like a sad person who has married a building. The really bad days it feels like my head is made of glass and you can see the line running through it and the line will crack me if I breathe wrong. I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d she glanced around the caf\u00e9 with a quick apology because she was about to say a thing her place didn\u2019t like \u201c\u2014I don\u2019t vanish, Eli. But I can imagine how someone could if the line were their line more than mine.\u201d\n\nI did the stupid little sigh I do when somebody says something I have been pretending is mine alone. It isn\u2019t relief. Relief is simpler. This was kinship and the fear kinship brings. It tied my chest in a better knot. \u201cI can make my hand go,\u201d I said, as small as I could make the confession and still have it fit in a sentence. \u201cSometimes more. It\u2019s not right. But I can. And it squeals in the room unless I wear these or make the room friendly.\u201d\n\nKiri didn\u2019t move her face much. She didn\u2019t need to. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, the way a seam takes a stitch. \u201cWhen I read your letter I thought, if it\u2019s just me with the note, I can make friends with it. If it\u2019s not just me, then either I\u2019m not mad or we both are, and either of those outcomes is a relief. Lanterns?\u201d\n\nWe let the conversation sit in its own warmth while she fetched the key and the look that let her walk through doors people keep shut. We followed her down a corridor that smelled of dust that had agreed to be dust for a hundred years and up a service lift that hummed the way all lifts hum as if persuading themselves they are going up. The back-of-house here is a geometry of doors and signs that tell you not to do things you weren\u2019t going to do. Kiri unlocked a steel cabinet with a placard about charging and the dangerous romance of batteries, and we carried out lanterns that pretended to be mild until you made them behave. While we were there, surrounded by racks of blank-faced crates and dollies that wanted to be useful, she let us listen to the hum.\n\nIt was not our hum. It was the hum of a large organism that has to pretend to be a building. The floor under us had opinions. The piles in the harbour had their own song. The climate plant throbbed like a accountability. Kiri put her palm against a concrete column as if greeting a friend she owed money to. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, not looking ridiculous at all, because if anyone has the right to pet a building it is the person keeping everything in it from crumbling, \u201cis a good one.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t go there. Not because I didn\u2019t want to. Because everything in me that had learned manners told me not to touch the thing that held up this room with a trick I only partly owned. I breathed anyway because a man cannot help breathing, and the note in my head reached for the column without the rest of me giving it permission. There was no squeal. There was a rounding, like a wave that had found a different beach. The cuff on my wrist made a small sound, a bird gargle, and Miri flicked her eyes at it and then at me, a question and an answer in one blink.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d I said, cheap as a liar, and Kiri held up her hand like she was reminding a child that adults can hear lying.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, not fussy at all. \u201cNot because I don\u2019t want to see your fun party trick. Because this is a place where if you faint we have to fill in a digital form.\u201d\n\nWe took the lanterns like people who had borrowed eggs from a neighbor and promised to send back a cake. Kiri walked us back to the public part the long way so I could see the places the sound liked and didn\u2019t. Over the loading dock, where the sea talks in tyres and ropes, it was lower, not kinder exactly, but busy with other business. In the top corridor with the little windows where school groups line up to enter the earthquake thing I refuse to name, it was sharp and uncooperative. We made faces at it. \u201cI wear ear defenders in here when I\u2019m just moving through,\u201d Kiri said, demonstrating with a pair that folded out of her cardigan like a magician\u2019s prop. \u201cYoung lungs. Their frequencies. I hate saying it because it makes me a terrible person, but children are loud in ways my brain hates.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to hate it and still be fine,\u201d Miri said, which is the sort of sentence she keeps for people who deserve it.\n\nAt the caf\u00e9 door Kiri gave me a piece of paper folded in four because she doesn\u2019t trust email for things that matter. It was a sketch of rooms with notes beside them, a map of weather inside a building drawn by someone who has spent years watching temperature and relative humidity think. \u201cIf you get into trouble when you\u2019re here,\u201d she said, and her hand hovered, then settled on the wood as if signing the building\u2019s arm, \u201cgo to the exhibition hall opposite the textile lab. The cabinets are glass. Glass hates your note. It will spit you back like a child with medicine. You\u2019ll hate it too. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll know it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nOn the way out we passed a school group in their yellow vests and a teacher doing the voice about using inside voices in a building. One kid looked at us and stuck an earplug in his ear that wasn\u2019t there and winked. I couldn\u2019t tell if he belonged to this little cult of the note or if he was just being an obedient mimic. Outside, the wind decided to be cruel to kites again. Miri squeezed my wrist, her thumb finding the edge of the cuff like someone checking a seal, and said, \u201cWe\u2019re getting a club together whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t start a club,\u201d I said, and then immediately wanted to start a club, a small one that met in quiet rooms and drank tea and told the truth about the way buildings breathe.\n\nBack home, I tried to write down everything I thought I had learned about the line and the rooms and what Kiri had said, but language went slippery and my words made fools of themselves on the page. I put the paper under the long white cloud magnet and drew a picture of the anchor instead, which soothed me in a way that made me embarrassed for thirty seconds until it didn\u2019t. Miri put the lanterns on the rimu table without a cloth because she wasn\u2019t worried about scratches and made labels that said BORROWED in her neat capitals, because she is the kind of person who will make sure we give things back with a thank you card even when we got them by official channels.\n\nWe took one of the lanterns down to our museum that evening not because we\u2019d lose power again but because sometimes light that isn\u2019t from the walls is good company. The building did its after-hours breathe that makes me think of animals putting their noses under their tails. I put the lantern on the desk where Graeme pretends to have modern thoughts and let it make its own circle. The anchor did its hum like it had a conversation to continue. The cuff was warm against my wrist; the chain in my pocket was the weight of a favour you\u2019ve agreed to do before you know what it is.\n\n\u201cYou going to tell Graeme about your new friend?\u201d Miri asked, palming the lantern\u2019s handle like she\u2019d design a better one if the world would let her spoil the fun of it.\n\n\u201cIf I say Te Papa he will do that thing where he pretends we\u2019re not a museum but a historical failure to be a supermarket,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell him about the lights. He loves lights now. He dreams of incident reports. He\u2019s going to start writing them for his breakfast.\u201d\n\nShe laughed quietly, and the laugh ran round the room and came back softer, the way people are kinder to your jokes when they like the place you\u2019ve made them in. For a while we just sat. That was a skill we didn\u2019t have to learn. When I breathed and let the line find the anchor again without going anywhere, I felt it answer more quickly, as if cordiality had been established. The hiss rounded with the chain\u2019s help. The cuff made no noise. Outside the ferry made its pattern we were pretending not to be reading and Miri didn\u2019t count but did move her fingers against her knee in that way she does when numbers are better than words.\n\n\u201cNews from Jace,\u201d she said, because she knows not to let silence get fancy. \u201cHe got a tattoo he says is a tribute to his derailleur and also to you. It\u2019s a circle with a notch you can\u2019t see unless he flexes, which he made me do my best to avoid. He says he understands your line now, philosophically, which is to say he understands absolutely nothing but believes he does, and in men that\u2019s almost as useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll thank him for thinking of me while flexing,\u201d I said, and made a mental note to buy him fries, the only currency he accepts for good intentions.\n\nWe were closing early because the storm had rearranged everyone\u2019s appetite for maritime heritage, and I was sweeping the life buoys room which always makes me feel judged for reasons I can\u2019t explain when the woman with the sunhat walked in without her sunhat and with a pear in her hand. She saw me and did a very brave thing: she didn\u2019t turn away this time. She came and stood near the anchor like it was a person we had both come to talk to. \u201cI posted a card,\u201d she began, as if she weren\u2019t sure whether the fact of it made it true. \u201cHe told me you got it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d I said, because truth is easy when it\u2019s small. \u201cThank you. I liked the bit about the pear.\u201d\n\nShe smiled with one side of her mouth because the other was shy. \u201cI decided to come back and not bring the hat to see if it helped. I did bring the pear again but I ate it on the way because the bus driver had opinions and I have low blood sugar when men have opinions. I\u2026 wanted to apologise again but also to say, if it happens again, I\u2019ll try not to make my face do the thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t promise it won\u2019t ever be ugly,\u201d I said, hating the way that sounded like a threat and wanting to make it into a promise and not knowing how. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it. The sound. We\u2019re making shapes for it so it doesn\u2019t stab the air. And\u2014thank you for coming back. That\u2019s not nothing.\u201d\n\nShe looked at the anchor the way people look at old dogs who will not do tricks. \u201cWhen I was little my mum\u2019s hearing aids would squeal and she\u2019d take them out and put them in her pocket and then whatever we were talking about would go away. It used to make me furious, like the sound had stolen my mother. It didn\u2019t, of course. She did what she could. But I\u2019ve been a bit cross with sound my whole life. Yours felt like\u2014\u201d she searched for it and found something that made her own face relax \u201c\u2014like a mistake nobody meant. I can forgive that.\u201d\n\nWe stood there in that small generosity like birds willing to eat from a hand that doesn\u2019t trust itself. She asked the anchor nothing in particular. The anchor returned the favour. When she left, she did it by saying \u201cbye\u201d to the room, which meant more to me than the letter, which is saying something because I have become an absolute tragic for the post.\n\nThat evening, at our table, Miri drilled two more holes in the clay of a mug where the handle met the body and blew across it to make sure the note came and I told her about the pear woman and she tipped imaginary beer for the brave. We had lantern light on for the sake of it while our actual working lights did their duty, which is the kind of decadent we can afford. I tried again to write properly to Kiri, to tell her what the anchor felt like and what the wind did to the ferry horns and how the bus was a danger to my elbow, but the pen took over and I wrote instead about the column and the way concrete has this big slow kindness and posted it before I could burn it. When I came back in Miri was holding the cuff and talking to it like it was a small animal that had done something both dear and stupid and I had to sit down because the day had grown a shape that fit me and the fit was a relief I didn\u2019t trust.\n\nWe started meeting Kiri in unimportant corners once a week, lending things and returning them, passing the hard sentences we couldn\u2019t bear to say to anyone else. She had two colleagues she thought might hear when she did but wasn\u2019t sure whether to risk it, and she told us once about a time in the art store when the frames all creaked together like a chorus line and she\u2019d had to sit on the floor and pretend her laces were misbehaving. She showed us how to stand in a doorway if we thought the knife wanted out, the angle that made the sound find the edge of itself and trip, which is either physics or faith. We traded maps of rooms like kids who liked different trees. We learnt the smell of battery plastic. We got very good at apologising to inanimate objects when we used them as if they were animate, which is to say we talked to the marlin and to concrete and to little orange cones and to mugs that learned to sing.\n\nA letter arrived from Nana\u2019s old retirement village, not because the universe has no subtlety but because lives have paperwork and we had forgotten some of it. A nurse wrote in a tidy, cheerful hand that they were clearing out their store of lost-and-not-claimed and had found a set of hearing aids we might want for sentimental purposes, which is a sentence that could make anyone cry and then laugh and then want to throw a chair. We went to fetch them because there is no world in which we wouldn\u2019t at least go and see. The woman behind the counter was efficient with a pen and gentle with her voice and slid a small box across to us like a thing that could break time if you dropped it.\n\nThey were not Nana\u2019s; that was obvious the second Miri opened the lid. They were too modern, the sort that live in your ear invisibly and make you think you can hear the weather decide. Miri touched them with one finger and then drew her finger back because nobody knew what anyone had promised these tiny machines. \u201cWe should give them to someone who\u2019ll use them,\u201d she said, which sounded like sense and also like a door. We took them home anyway because we are magpies and put them in the same drawer as the chain when it is sleeping and the tin of earplugs and the letter from Kiri and the postcard with pear on it and acknowledged that our junk drawer had become a very particular kind of reliquary.\n\nThat night I took one of the little hearing aids out and put it in my palm and you know how sometimes objects tell you their pasts with a smell or a colour. This one didn\u2019t. It sat and pretended to be neutral. I put it in, because not to would have been cowardly in a way that didn\u2019t keep anybody safe, and immediately the world sharpened itself\u2014the crisp on the edge of the fridge, the damp in the window frame, Miri humming under her breath which she always does when she stirs something to trick it into not catching. The hiss in my head did something else. It made room for the hearing aid. It coiled back a fraction, then found a different rail and ran along it. There was no knife. There was no blessed silence. There was adjustment, which is more honest than either.\n\nMiri looked up and registered the face I make when I\u2019m trying not to look like my head is a concert hall. \u201cBad?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d I said, and waited for my own protest. \u201cDifferent. Like\u2014I\u2019ve put a mirror behind the bar. The bottles all look like there are more of them, and the room feels bigger, and none of the alcohol has increased. The line didn\u2019t go away. It moved its chair.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that going to make your hand worse,\u201d she asked, practical even through the soft. \u201cOr is that going to make you less annoying at the bus stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, which is a phrase that, spoken out loud at the right table, is actually a spell. \u201cI think I want to see what concrete does with this.\u201d\n\nWe tried it by the anchor like we do all things now because we are those people. With the hearing aid in, the chain around my wrist and the orange cones in the tin glaring up like little carrots waiting for soup, I let the line find the anchor hum and it was as if two musicians who had been playing next to each other without acknowledging each other finally looked up and nodded. The knife stayed away. The building\u2019s breath came through the small machine like a polite visitor. The cuff didn\u2019t twitter. The cleaning light above the life buoys didn\u2019t flicker. I did not go. I stayed. I counted to six, to seven, to eight, to the ferry, which surprised me by not sounding just then. When I took the little machine out the world sighed out of its sharpness and back into its familiar, and I wanted to write a thank you card to a factory somewhere and did not know how to address it.\n\nWe did not keep the hearing aids. We took them back to the village with a note that said thank you and also, if nobody claims them in a month, please see if they can go to the clinic down the road that does the cheap fittings for people who find the world blurrier than they can afford. And then we went to the National Library again to annoy the guard because we are unteachable and stood in the atrium and did nothing and thought how nice it is sometimes to have a day that does nothing to you.\n\nOn Saturday, Jace played a set in a place that never has enough chairs and Miri and I wore our plugs and stood near the back because that is our idea of romance. He had the new tattoo, stupid and good, and afterwards he put his sweaty arm around my shoulders and said quietly, \u201cI\u2019ve named your chain Nigel,\u201d which is the sort of thing that can save a person from drowning in their own ideas. On the walk home we crossed the road at the lights like citizens and the wind took a holiday and the ferry blew once in a way that meant nothing and we chose to count it anyway because structure is a gift we can give ourselves.\n\nThe next morning the sea broke an old bottle on the rocks and set it to singing in a way only we could hear and we didn\u2019t tell anyone because some things are for two or three people in a room with a thermos and a list of rooms that behave. Later that day a man from the council came and put up a sign by the loading dock about not feeding gulls, and the gulls observed him like gods. That night I dreamt that the city slid a key into me and turned it and a door I hadn\u2019t known was mine opened on air. When I woke, the hiss was a line and the line was a thing I could point to and not be owned by, and Miri was asleep with one orange plug half in, ridiculous, and the chain swung on the hook by the door the smallest amount as if a truck had gone by far away, and I went to work and put my hand on the anchor case and said, \u201cKia ora,\u201d to a piece of metal that had never asked to be greeted and was the kind of company that makes the rest possible.The day had the kind of plain light that makes everything honest whether it meant to be or not, and the anchor was cold under my palm through the glass in that way cold can be a kindness. I had dusted the case already and was not dusting it again; I was standing there like a man who\u2019d forgotten what he\u2019d come into a room for and had decided to make his forgetting look deliberate. The hiss had tucked itself into the corner of my head like a cat that was pretending it didn\u2019t want attention. Graeme did his shuffle behind me that announces a visitor who will both be important and need to be placated. He has a shuffle for bored tourists, a shuffle for school groups, and this was his polite panic shuffle, the one he used for men in suits with clipboards who can adjust budgets by coughing.\n\n\u201cEli,\u201d he said, and it became an introduction. \u201cThis is Rory from Council. Heritage. He\u2019s here to do an audit. Routine. Entirely routine. He is not here to remove anything or to suggest anything be removed.\u201d\n\nRory shook my hand like he\u2019d been taught to shake hands during a module called Community Engagement. He was younger than me and older than the way he spoke. His hair had a part in it that looked drawn with a ruler. His clipboard had the frog-stare of a thing that would not blink first. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a sweep,\u201d he said, and smiled like that was friendly. \u201cJust making sure your documentation is up to date for the anchor and associated items.\u201d\n\n\u201cDocumentation,\u201d said Graeme in a tone that is usually followed by the delicate sound of paper having a nervous breakdown. \u201cYes. Well. Of course. Associated items include everything in this room in a philosophical sense.\u201d\n\nRory didn\u2019t laugh because he had trained himself not to, even when things were funny. He walked to the anchor and stood contemplating it with the new way city people look at old things: anxious in case they are meant to be moved, anxious in case they are meant to be worshipped. \u201cThere\u2019s a proposal,\u201d he said lightly, too lightly, not looking at me, \u201cto gather some of the historically significant maritime pieces from the smaller spaces to\u2014 well, to consolidate. For care. And access.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsolidate,\u201d repeated Graeme, the way you repeat a diagnosis you disagree with. \u201cTe Papa doesn\u2019t want our anchor. It would be like bringing a stray dog to a man with a lion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about what they want,\u201d said Rory, and then saw me seeing him and adjusted. \u201cIt\u2019s about a coordinated story. Our waterfront narrative is fragmented. We\u2019re seeking cohesion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can hold your cohesion while you get your coat,\u201d I said before my mouth checked with my better angels. \u201cThe anchor\u2019s part of the story by being here, where people come in by mistake and leave on purpose.\u201d\n\nRory wrote something that was probably not what I had said. He opened his mouth to be nice to me and Miri walked in. She never comes in on audit days on purpose, but she has a nose for the sort of person who says consolidate in a voice like a dentist with a brochure. She had clay on her wrist like a bracelet nobody sells. She clocked him, clocked the clipboard, stood beside me and put her hand flat on the glass as if to demonstrate how very much the anchor was staying. \u201cKia ora,\u201d she said pleasantly. \u201cYou here to tell us a story about consolidation, or you here to hear one?\u201d\n\nHe blinked because her version of polite is the sort that slides under armour without tearing it. He asked a few more questions about accession numbers and the acid-free paper we didn\u2019t have; Graeme made noises like a man sacrificing himself to a god of forms. When Rory left he shook my hand too properly again and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d which in Wellington either means never or means the exact opposite. The hiss in my head had raised its head enough to let me feel the edge of it. The anchor did its single quiet thrum and I beat back a ridiculous urge to ask it whether it wanted to leave like a person with a dog who says \u201cWalk?\u201d to a creature who will always answer yes and mean you.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll take it if we don\u2019t chain ourselves to it,\u201d said Graeme, once the door had closed, and then realised what he had said and looked at my wrist as if the clay band were an omen. \u201cI mean\u2014 they\u2019ll request to rehouse it. We will\u2026 advocate.\u201d He said the word like he was studying it in a field guide. \u201cWe will be devastated in a manner that appears rational on paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould they really shift it?\u201d I asked, because I needed to throw my dread against a wall to see whether it bounced.\n\n\u201cIf a crane can lift it and a committee can nod at it, then yes,\u201d said Miri, who has made a map in her head of how money moves heavy things. \u201cHush. We\u2019re not fighting ghosts. We\u2019ll make noise if we have to. Community consultation is a thing. So is being here at the right time with the right people making the right fuss.\u201d\n\nWe could make fuss, yes; we were practitioners. But there is fuss and there is noise, and the latter is the enemy of the line. I spent the rest of the morning being good, by which I mean making myself small in the public rooms and large in the cupboards where the supplies keep their own weird order. The hiss stayed reasonable. The chain in my pocket knocked its small household noise. The clay cuff sat easy. I sent Kiri a message that said, in the code we were learning, Council man. Consolidate. Anchor at risk of being curated elsewhere. She sent back one word: Lunch? and an arrow that pointed downwards, which is to say the piles.\n\nWe met her at the freight lift like we had the first time, a conspiratorial miracle of bad lighting and polite ignoration by anyone who might have stopped us. The undercroft is not for the public because the public deserves better than to know how their gods stand up. It smells of salt that has been made to behave and concrete that surrendered to water a long time ago and now makes a religion of standing perfectly still. Kiri walked us between columns like a woman walking with trees she liked and did not need to name. \u201cBefore we start being sensible,\u201d she said, as if we ever had, \u201ctell me what Council said.\u201d\n\nWe told her, and she made a face that would not play on television. \u201cOf course they want a single story,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course they do. It\u2019s tidier. But they have never met the sea properly if they think it will hold still for their brochure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill we have to give it up?\u201d I asked, the way a child asks whether his house can be taken because he is poor and people with suits like to bother poor people. Kiri put a hand on a column and breathed in the way I recognise now because it\u2019s my habit too.\n\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes the trick isn\u2019t shouting. It\u2019s showing your messy little room is actually holding a note the big rooms can\u2019t. No one likes to admit their big stories can\u2019t be sung without a small place humming the line.\u201d She cut her eyes at me. \u201cShow me, but not too much. The piles are ruthless; they\u2019ll keep you if you put your foot wrong.\u201d\n\nI put my earplug in one side and the chain across my palm and counted like I was sneaking across a sleeping dog. The column\u2019s note was so steady it made my teeth want to relax. I made myself not be ambitious. Left hand only, to the wrist, the cuff holding me within the embarrassment range. The hiss didn\u2019t sharpen here; it deepened, a violin moving nearer to being a cello by standing close to one. There was no knife. The hearing aid, the cheap one we\u2019d borrowed and returned already in theory, wasn\u2019t in, and I missed it for half a second and then not at all. The air changed around the place where I wasn\u2019t and the column accepted that as if its job included hosting idiocy. The weight under us made manners of my nerves. Above our heads people did their museum. Down here the building did its patience.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Kiri, and her voice sounded better than mine in this room because it had learnt to be low. \u201cGlass will spit you and stone won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s our rule for now. Remember it when your hand gets ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hand is all idea,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s my ambition I don\u2019t trust.\u201d\n\nWe came up with a plan that was not a plan so much as a promise to pay attention in public: if Council pushed, we would bring the people who visited because they wandered and stayed because a heavy thing greeted them and we would make our case in a room that liked us. Kiri would talk to the two colleagues she thought might hear as we do, sound out (the phrase is irritatingly exact) their lines. She would find the pages in our messy accession records that proved the anchor belonged to the room as much as it belonged to paper. \u201cWe will be very nice to the person with the stamp,\u201d she said gravely. \u201cWe will practise quiet and then noise in the right order.\u201d\n\nIn the days after, the weather did a handshake with us: calm enough to feel chosen, unsettled enough to keep from smugness. Miri\u2019s mugs, the ones with their small whistle holes shaped like decisions, got famous in a way she didn\u2019t plan and then had to behave as if she had. A friend of a friend took a photo of someone blowing across a handle and making a noise like a soft kettle and put it on a thing and the thing did what things do. Orders. People asked stupid questions about whether the mugs were haunted on purpose. A man wanted to know if her cups had Bluetooth. A woman sent a long email about the ethics of vessels that make sound for people who are not sound-typical and I watched Miri write back three drafts before she chose the one that said, in her pretty handwriting, I am not selling you a therapy. I am selling you a cup you can coax if you like.\n\nThe only bit of success that wasn\u2019t paper was the kiln. The kiln had its own line and I had never noticed because why would I, it had never wanted me before. In the second firing after the attention arrived, it found the hiss and made a friend of it, the dangerous way some friends make everything into a game with a knife. The small squeal started not in the air but in the wall, and Miri went pale and steady the way she goes when she\u2019s about to do a sensible thing and hates that that\u2019s her job. We\u2019d already made a rule about earplugs in the kitchen when the kiln is sulking; we made another about not being in the same room as it without at least being prepared to count.\n\n\u201cJust stand there,\u201d she said, already cross with herself for asking, \u201cand tell it not to be grand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to negotiate with a box of fire,\u201d I said, which is precisely the sort of sentence I had not expected to say sincerely in my thirties.\n\n\u201cYou want to rescue anchors,\u201d she said, and we looked at each other with the standard amount of care. I stood in the doorway because Kiri had taught us the trick of doors, chain doing its small duty against my vein. The squeal was inching up to glass-knife territory, the kind that goes right under your nail and takes your patience with it. I did the Nana hand over ear because it had become my superstition and breathed the kiln into a different room in my head. The line in me curved downwards, asking the box to take that note instead of the other. It did not like being told. Neither do I. We compromised like badly-mannered neighbours: we agreed on a pitch that didn\u2019t make my eyes water. The little bird noises in my cuff were ridiculous and helpful. Miri\u2014who had never coddled me when I was being dramatic and wasn\u2019t about to start\u2014gave me a nod like a pilot giving a plane leave to land. After, she slid a cup of water across the bench in that way she has of detaching tenderness from making a scene.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not firing with you in the house again unless we make a hymn book,\u201d she said, blowing out her cheeks. \u201cAnd if I get a migraine, I\u2019m sending it to you in an envelope.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease send me all your headaches,\u201d I said. \u201cI collect them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not that important,\u201d she said, and put her hand on my shoulder like I am.\n\nWord got around in the way word gets around in cities that like to think of themselves as villages and in villages that want credit for their cosmopolitan kinks. A teenage boy came in with his mother and stood by the bird wall and didn\u2019t look at me and did that thing kids do where they pretend they can copy a trick by deciding to be the sort of person who can do it. He held his breath and went purple and I went over not because I\u2019m a policeman but because purple is not a good colour on anyone. \u201cMate,\u201d I said, conspiratorially. \u201cThat\u2019s not how the tricks work. The trick is to put your lungs down. Not to squeeze them like lemons.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me sidelong because being seen is distasteful when you are fifteen and fond of yourself. He let go of his held breath in a dramatic exhale that would have embarrassed movie stars and scuffed his shoe. His mother did that grateful smile women in public do when men have chosen not to make something worse. \u201cI heard,\u201d she began, and I did the face that says please stop hearing, and she did stop, to my surprise. \u201cRight. Not for kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot for anyone without a manual,\u201d I said, and that didn\u2019t satisfy her, but we\u2019d both behaved how we wanted to about it, and that was enough.\n\nKiri invited us to a room we had not got onto our map yet, a generosity I knew she didn\u2019t extend lightly. Te Papa has spaces that are legends even to people who work there. The old cable-car winding house near the top of the hill is one; it holds a smell like old bread and hot metal. The plant room at the back where the water comes in is another. This room was a store for stone carvings, a quiet square with too much air, racks like pews, blankets that had learned humility. It was not just stone; it was stone that had been asked to be more than stone and had said yes at a chisel. Kiri, whose face is careful and whose hands are not, put her palm against an old lintel with a pattern worn by fingers and time and said, \u201cHere,\u201d like she was offering us a glass of water.\n\nI had both earplugs halfway in because I am a coward with a complicated job. I took one out to hear the room and not just my own orchestra and counted to see if the hiss wanted to be helpful or if it had decided to be an arse. It was good in here. The weight was kind. The little birds at my wrist kept their beaks shut. Miri didn\u2019t speak. Kiri did talk, softly, about care and whether care means preventing or listening. She asked me whether the stone sounded anything like the anchor. I told her that the anchor was monocular in its goodness; it looked in one direction with a steady regard. The stone had facets. The stone wanted you to move slightly until you found its patience. The anchor had sworn a thing and would not be moved from it. The stone had sworn a different thing and expected you to know how to stand near it.\n\n\u201cI can manage facets,\u201d said Kiri, and she put her ear to the lintel in a way that was both foolish and brave. \u201cDon\u2019t do the big party trick,\u201d she added, without looking up. \u201cRespectfully, this room does not want to see you go absent. You can hear that, yeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and felt relieved to have the instruction given as if we were all capable of mercy.\n\nWe left with our manners intact and the room unalarmed, which is not nothing. On the way out, by the loading dock, Kiri touched my arm in the place where my hand sometimes forgets me. \u201cIf they try to take your anchor,\u201d she said, voice low as a storage vault, \u201cwe will put a crowd where crowds count. And if they do take it, we will ask to curate the absence. Which, frankly, is your area.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not making a memorial to the anchor while the anchor is still alive,\u201d I said, and winced at myself for sounding like an auntie talking about her third husband.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making a plan B,\u201d she said, because she knows about institutions and how they never choose to be kind; they have to be cornered into it.\n\nThere was a southerly predicted the way Wellington predicts things: cheerfully, then apologetically, then with concern and a diagram. In the morning, before it arrived, the harbour had that flatness you get before someone slaps it. The weather app on my phone had decided to be poetic and said squalls, which is a word our town gives to meanness. By eleven, the sky came down like it was trying to be on the level with us. By eleven-fifteen, the rain arrived sideways with twenty cousins and an attitude problem. Graeme came out from behind his desk as if his rank included rowing. \u201cShutters,\u201d he said, which is the closest thing he has to a battle cry. \u201cWe never use them. We will today.\u201d\n\nThe shutters are a set of metal tongues that drop from above the door when the weather remembers who made this city, and they had not been asked to do their duty in longer than anyone could guarantee with paperwork. Two were obedient, if sulky. The third was a bastard. It had jammed itself three quarters down and thought that was a statement we should admire. Water began to make a plan at floor level, a thin bright certainty. Outside, the square looked like a ship deck. Inside, the museum began to feel like a box you pack in a hurry.\n\n\u201cToolbox,\u201d said Graeme, hurrying in that dignified way he reserves for disasters and weddings. He passed me the thing. I found the sort of spanner that has ideas above its station. I put my hands where hands go when there\u2019s a problem with a system that has not been asked to prove itself since 2007. The hiss tried to be clever and I told it not now. The chain nudged my wrist, an old friend clearing its throat. The clay cuff didn\u2019t sing until I got my fingers too near the part where the shutter\u2019s tongue hid behind metal pretending to be a wall. It made one small alarm noise like a trapped bird and I stopped because I had taught myself to stop when equipment pretended to be alive.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d said Miri behind me, not unkindly. She had the bucket because even on days like this she insists on the appropriate theatre props. \u201cWe will not have you taking risks with your stupid gift and my good broom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d I said, and then I put my hand into the cavity anyway because the other option was to let the shutter do its impression of a choice. The gap was narrow; this was the point. My knuckles scuffed metal. I let the line take my fingers only, a polite retreat from skin, slipped across the sneer of a bracket that had corroded itself into a position and didn\u2019t want to be coaxed. The squeal tried to climb up the metal; I cupped my ear like a man thinking hard and pushed the knife back into a shape the room could digest. I found the catch, it was a child of a catch, not meant to be the problem it had become. I pressed it with invisible digits, felt the give, felt the old grease try to swallow my pride and my half-hand together. I breathed for two slow ticks of the metronome that was not here and yet was, and the shutter took the hint and slid the last two hands-worth like the end of a thought you can finally remember. Water hit it with the authority of a government department. We stepped back into the middle of the room and watched the river bargain with the door and lose.\n\n\u201cNo incident,\u201d said Graeme, which is what he says when there has been one but he would like us to behave as if there hasn\u2019t. He looked at me with that specific horror administrators get when their staff have done a thing that makes stories. \u201cThank you,\u201d he added, and he meant it, which cost him some paperwork in heaven.\n\n\u201cWrite it down as I applied manual assistance to a recalcitrant mechanism,\u201d I said, and he did, later, with only one adverb, which is how you know he was shaken.\n\nThe storm gave us the courtesy of not being longer than it needed to be. It slapped, it spat, it flounced off, it left behind its receipts: a car with a sense of shame two streets over, a bin lid in a place no bin had ever been, several gulls in a mood. The shutters dripped dignity. The anchor took none of it personally. The floor took it all personally and sulked until Miri told it off with a mop and a word that might be a spell. I put the spanner away in the wrong place because I am a saboteur and the man who knows where it is likes being useful.\n\nThat night it did the thing where it is, for a moment, so clear you suspect somebody washed the day. I rang Jace and told him the shutter story and he laughed and said, \u201cYour ghost fingers are getting the best overtime,\u201d and then made a plan to bring us chips, because his way of negotiating grief is grease. He turned up with a paper parcel and a knot of compliments and told me he\u2019d started a waiting list for people who wanted little chains to put in their pockets even though they didn\u2019t know why. \u201cNigel is breeding,\u201d he said, deadpan, and Miri glowered at him as if he were to blame for the existence of puns.\n\nWe were almost done with the chips when Kiri sent a message that was not like her. It didn\u2019t have any difficult words in it. It had three: At mine? Please. I looked at Miri. She\u2019d already got her coat. We went.\n\nKiri\u2019s house was exactly what I thought it would be: books shelved with a logic I do not share, careful cups, a plant that looked like it was flourishing out of sheer politeness. She met us at the door with no theatre in her face, which made a theatre in mine; I am a person who needs cues. \u201cIt\u2019s not an emergency,\u201d she said, reading me rightly. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014 I had a\u2026 experience. And I would rather not file it by myself in the cabinet labelled \u2018Professionals Don\u2019t Do This\u2019.\u201d\n\nWe sat at her kitchen table because kitchens are the only stage where people say the things they mean to say. She wrapped her hands around a mug that probably had a provenance. She spoke very simply because that\u2019s how you do it when your mouth has had to work at being brave. In the stone room, after we left, she\u2019d gone back to log her activities in that way she has that means she sleeps at night. The note in her head had been misbehaving against her better judgement. The concrete in that room is different; it\u2019s trying too hard not to be the earth. She had stood in the doorway like a well-brought-up ghost and put her hand on the lintel again, just the casual touch you give to something expensive when you\u2019re pretending not to love it. She had felt\u2014not desire, she said, not that gross word\u2014permission. And her palm had gone cool in that way my gone hand goes. She had felt the shape of her own hand against the absence it made. She had pulled back at once because she had the enemy of all museum workers in her body\u2014the fear of breaking the thing\u2014and because she is sensible. Still. It had happened. The sound afterwards had been gentle. But it had been real.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t vanish. I didn\u2019t intend to. But the line\u2026 made a way for me,\u201d she said, and there was no drama in her voice, which is how you know you\u2019re in the company of the reliable kind of person who does frightening things. \u201cI have rules about not touching anything I cannot fix. I stood in my own kitchen later and put my hand on the wood and waited, because wood loves me and hates me in equal measure. Nothing. So I do not think I am becoming the kind of person you are. I also do not think you are the kind of person who is happening to me. I think the rooms are\u2026 teaching us.\u201d\n\nMiri leaned forwards like a counsellor who has thought of a metaphor I can afford. \u201cRooms as teachers,\u201d she said. \u201cRooms as hearing aids. Rooms as instruments. You don\u2019t get to pick the lesson, but you can choose your seat.\u201d\n\nKiri rubbed her forehead with a finger that had a patch of glue on it. \u201cMy boss would love to add \u2018avoiding becoming incorporeal\u2019 to our risk register, but I\u2019d rather not,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need some more rules. Rule one, as before: glass spits. Rule two: stone is kind but will keep you if you let it. Rule three: metal will sing for you but will not save you from stupidity. Rule four: if you\u2019re near electricity and you even think of going\u2014you will ring me and I will ring you and we will make sure you do not look like a fried novelty at the fair.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll write them properly and put them on the fridge,\u201d said Miri, because of course she would. \u201cAlso: earplugs in rooms that want to scream. Also: chain for pockets. Also: buddy. No tricks in alleys.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso,\u201d I said, because we were making a covenant and jokes come hand-in-hand with vows in our family, \u201cwe will start an unofficial official club.\u201d\n\nKiri made a face that contained surprise and relief and despair. \u201cWe absolutely will not,\u201d she said, and then, having said it, let the opposite be true. \u201cFine. It will need a stupid name. It cannot be \u2018The Line\u2019 because men will make t-shirts. \u2018Practising Quiet,\u2019\u201d she offered, almost shyly, which is her version of swagger. \u201cWe can call it that when we need to tidy it away from people who don\u2019t know how to hold fragile sentences.\u201d\n\nWe did not sign anything. We did not make a logo. Miri took a pen out of nowhere and began to write on the back of a flyer for a ceramic sale: our names, the rules, the rooms that like us, and a one-line description that read, in her print, Practising Quiet is a group of people who hear a sound that makes their bones behave and who won\u2019t be idiots about it. We all looked at her word idiots and nodded like church people at a hymn.\n\nOn the way home, the wind had chosen to arrange itself into little fists that smacked your ears when you weren\u2019t expecting it. The ferry did not blow; it was probably sulking in its berth and recounting its own courage to itself. The anchor at the museum would be drying behind its shutter, the chain thinking its slow thoughts. The kiln would be sleeping like a child that had tantrumed all afternoon. The city kept all its lights on because people need proof of their own continuance. In the alley by the garages, there was a new chalk X where a different child had placed a different treasure. We walked past it without the usual clutch, buoyant with the knowledge that our strange was not alone and also not infinite.\n\nThe next morning my mother rang, which she does once a month because she keeps a calendar for everything, including her guilt. She asked me if I was eating, which is code for I love you and also please don\u2019t make me be complicated. I told her about the storm because storms are safe to talk about; they\u2019re nobody\u2019s fault. She told me about the woman from her walking group who had broken her wrist on a kerb and about Gareth texting from Blenheim about an alpaca being born with a white spot in the shape of an earring. \u201cHe misses Miri,\u201d she said in that middle voice that tries not to fault anyone. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to say it like a person who has ever done feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us do,\u201d I said, and meant it in the forgiving way, which is new. \u201cTell him she\u2019s fine. Tell him she\u2019s building a small, unnecessary empire. Tell him I said she can\u2019t be adopted by alpacas because she\u2019s too short.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t tell my mother about Practising Quiet. I didn\u2019t tell her that my hand goes and comes like an unpunctual child. I didn\u2019t tell her that I love an anchor. I did tell her to bring pears if she came by, and she made a noise that meant the part of her that is a mother was satisfied by a practical instruction. After we hung up, I stood and watched the light behaving itself on the kitchen floorboards. The hiss was good. The chain touched the doorframe like a wind-chime behaving because the wind had decided to be polite. The tin with the orange cones sat on the table where we always leave it now and I opened it and counted them, because it turns out there are things in a life a person can count and feel less alone.\n\nCouncil did get in touch, three weeks later, because time in government is measured not in days but in the number of chairs a person has sat on and the number of signatures a thing has carried across town. They wanted to come and \u201cassess the feasibility\u201d of \u201ctemporary relocation during refurbishment.\u201d This is the sort of phrasing that means a thing wants to move and is asking you to bless it before it elopes. We made a day of it. We asked people with prams who had always come in out of the wind to write a sentence about the anchor in a book Miri found and labelled with a care that would shame archivists. We wrote down the names of the men who turned up on their lunch breaks to look at the thing that had met more water than them and sighed. We asked Rory to stand in the room during school arrival and watch what the anchor does to the noise level without moving a millimetre. Kiri came in on her day off and stood in the corner not being Te Papa and being the weight of Te Papa in a quiet way. We did not mention our club. We did not mention the way rooms either spit or hold. We did not mention the sound that sits in our bones like a low tide with a clock. We let the anchor do its job.\n\nAfter, Rory stood out front with his clipboard catching rain because the weather had chosen to perform aptness, and said to me, as if telling a person who does floors mattered, \u201cWe\u2019ll need to rethink the consolidation plan for this one. There\u2019s\u2026 site context. Also\u2014\u201d and here he made a face that was untrained \u201c\u2014people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can put that in a report,\u201d I said, and he did, because the new version of his clipboard had a place where you could tick the box that says intangible significance, which is our city\u2019s way of admitting that a heavy thing in the right room holds us together.\n\nThat night we didn\u2019t go to anyone\u2019s plant room. We didn\u2019t map any rooms. We didn\u2019t invent a new rule. We stood by the water in a wind that had stopped being furious and had started being merely opinionated and we ate chips with too much vinegar and the ferry blew once and then twice like it was correcting itself. The hiss stayed good. The anchor held. Kiri sent a message that only said \u0101e with a small dot like a blessing. Miri leaned her shoulder into mine like the younger sister she is and not the older one she sometimes has to be with me. We went home. I put my palm flat on the anchor case inside my head and said thank you to an absence I am learning to curate. We slept like people who have the right number of noises where they belong.",

                              "content": "The wind did its old Wellington thing, nudging, pushing, slapping at me as if to say, move along, mate, nothing to see here. Tin roofs rattled and murmured in a code you only learn by staying, by putting up with that sideways rain that doesn\u2019t fall, it ambushes. I stood by the fence out back of the flat, feeling the rimu pailings shiver against my shoulder every time a gust came up from the south. Late afternoon, light like old honey poured into a cracked jar. I finished a cig I shouldn\u2019t have started, blew smoke I couldn\u2019t afford, and watched it vanish as if the air itself had taken offence.\n\nMy name\u2019s Eli, short for Elisha, though no one except Nana ever called me that. Thirty-one, a bit frayed around the edges, running nights at a museum that was mostly empty even when it was open. Not the flash one with the earthquake room. The smaller one down near the port where tourists stumbled in looking for a toilet or a pack of postcards. My job was to keep the glass smudge-free and the floors not sticky. I was good at it, mostly because I liked being the last one to leave, the hum and buzz and click of the old building breathing like some old creature, a taniwha that had agreed, just this once, to sleep.\n\nBack then I was already hearing things. The doctor called it tinnitus and shrugged in that way doctors do when they can\u2019t do anything, a little island of power in the mouth, a lighthouse that didn\u2019t help. Personally I called it the hiss. Sometime round midnight, when the traffic lulled and the ferry out in the harbour moaned to itself, this slender thread of high, high sound would spool into my ear. It wasn\u2019t loud, not like a kettle. It was finer. Like the instant before glass cracks. Like a mosquito on the far side of a window you can\u2019t find. It bothered me. It also, and this is the difficult bit, fascinated me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re zoning out again.\u201d That was Miri, my step-sister, half in and half out of the kitchen doorway, chunky socks, hair in a eucalyptus-coloured scarf. She was only twenty-three, a barista by day and ceramicist by obsession, currently making mugs with little waves that didn\u2019t hold the tea right. She\u2019d moved in after Gareth (her dad, my stepfather for a while) had decamped to Blenheim with a woman called Leonie who liked alpacas and white furniture. There\u2019s a diagram somewhere, spiderish, that shows how our wh\u0101nau fit together. It doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that when the lease on Miri\u2019s place in Newtown morphed into something else, she turned up with three boxes and a bag of clay tools and said, \u201cI can make rent and also a hell stew.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm not,\u201d I said, flicking the cigarette into an old paint tin full of rainwater, where it hissed theatrically. Wind got my hair. \u201cJust watching the neighbours. They keep hanging washing right before a southerly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hope,\u201d she said, and went to stir the pot on the stove. \u201cCome on. Kai.\u201d\n\nInside was a warm mess. A good mess. Rimu table with three legs the same length and one a bit stubborn, a couch someone had thrown out that we draped a quilt over to make look intentional, jars with paintbrushes that weren\u2019t mine. Miri\u2019s laugh, which could be mean if she wanted it to be, wasn\u2019t tonight. The radio talked about a storm in Fiji and stopped. The lights flickered once, then held.\n\n\u201cCan you hear that?\u201d I asked, halfway through stew and leaning my ear towards the window.\n\n\u201cHear what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2026 edge. Like when you run your finger round a glass, you know, that singing thing. Like that, but tighter. Like it\u2019s in the wall.\u201d\n\nMiri stopped chewing and glanced towards the place my shoulder tried to point. Her mouth made the shape of whatever she heard. \u201cNah. You okay, Eli?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, nah, I\u2019m sweet,\u201d I lied, scooping more. The stew was heavy on cumin and sweet potato, the way she liked to cook, as if everything would be improved by that one spice that lived at the back of the shelf. It probably was improved. I swallowed and felt the sound slide deeper, a silver thread into the hollow behind my eyes.\n\nLater, at work, I tried to find it again. The museum was cool and holding a lot of echoes. Maritime stuff mostly\u2014black and white photos of men whose names weren\u2019t recorded and ships that were, old ropes behind glass cases, even an anchor as big as my bed. My boss, Graeme with an e not an a, said we conserved \u201cmaterial culture.\u201d Then he\u2019d look at the anchor like it was part of his own inside story and whisper, \u201cPurpose-built for a storm.\u201d\n\nAfter he went, I did my rounds. It\u2019s funny how your feet know the way before your head does. I wiped the fingerprints off a case with my own prints already superimposed, polished brass that didn\u2019t want to gleam any more than it already did, and in the quiet I breathed.\n\nI\u2019d noticed it worked better if I let the air through my nose and counted my heartbeats with it. In for six, wait for two, out for six. At first it was just a trick to keep panic out. Then the hiss, the thread, the singing that wasn\u2019t, edged back in. Not in the wall, not in the floorboards. Not in the anchor either. In me. Like someone had slipped a taut wire from my ribs to the space over the exhibits, and every time I inhaled slow the wire sang.\n\nThe first time anything actually happened my left hand twitched and did not catch the light the way my right hand did. Imagine holding your hands over a black bowl of water. Then imagine the reflection of the left hand going thin, like your fingers had become someone else\u2019s and could choose their own degree of being here. It freaked me out, sure, but I thought it was lighting. Museums do that to you. WellI thought so until the mop handle winked out as if it had been glued to my left palm.\n\nI choked on my own tongue and everything snapped back.\n\nI stood for a long time in the middle of the floor, glued to the cheap vinyl with a feeling like I\u2019d just taken my finger off a hot element. The mop was there. My hand was there. The anchor was still there, grim and heavy and smug as ever. It had only been a sliver of something. A shadow of a maybe.\n\n\u201cYou all good?\u201d asked the night guard on his round a few minutes later, just a man with a torch and a sigh.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, my voice the wrong pitch. \u201cDropped the mop. Stupid.\u201d\n\nHe nodded like he\u2019d heard worse things from mops and kept going. The light made a slice across the far wall. Dust motes danced in the beam like tiny underpaid actors getting paid in glow.\n\nI did not try it again that night. But I thought about it all the way home. The wind had taken a breather and the sky let a few stars through, pinholes in the bruise-coloured fabric. I caught my reflection in a closed shop window, the sort of all-night place that never quite opens. I stood in my own outline, trying to imagine the left side thinning, my ears hot with the memory of that inner song. For a full minute I felt sure that if I breathed just so I could peel away like masking tape. Then a bus went by and I was just another man on Vivian Street, jacket zipped wrong, thinking things.\n\n\u201cEli,\u201d Miri said when I came in around two, the way she says my name when she\u2019s had too much tea and is convinced she\u2019s the head of the household. \u201cDo me a favour and don\u2019t wake the neighbours with your tossing and etc. And shut the bathroom window. Cat got in. It stared at me like I owed it money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got it,\u201d I said. \u201cAlso, you\u2019ll think I\u2019m\u2026 but I think\u2026 something weird happened at work.\u201d\n\nShe was in bed, the lamp making a golden shell around her, earbuds in like grace notes. Flatmate life means learning to talk to people you love while not quite intruding on their peace. She sat up, pulled one earbud out. \u201cWeirder than the ship\u2019s captain who kept his wife\u2019s wedding ring on a chain of hair? Weirder than that time a tourist tried to pay you in euro coins and a prayer?\u201d\n\n\u201cWeirder.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Tell me in the morning. Put the kettle on.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep. The sound had gone with me into the dark, not louder, no, but close. It wasn\u2019t the obvious thing, not like the rush in your ears after a concert. It was some other version. Like being near a fence when the wind hums in it. If I lay very still, very still, it sharpened. It was as if there was a gap somewhere that only opened if you didn\u2019t stare at it, if you didn\u2019t shout. If you let your breath behave itself, and the rest of you got out of the way.\n\nMorning made everything common again in that way mornings do. Toast that jumped early and scorched thin. News about a council meeting that promised to decide nothing. Miri\u2019s pots like half-finished planets on the bench. I went to work. Tried to do the normal thing. But normal was like a jacket that didn\u2019t belong to me. A size too small in the shoulders, too shiny at the elbows.\n\n\u201cAt least pretend to mop near the front where the visitors can see you,\u201d Graeme told me, peering over his glasses like I\u2019d borrowed them without permission. \u201cAnd the school group from Naenae is coming at eleven. Captain\u2019s logbook needs to be open at page thirty-three. We paid for the copy. No sticky fingers on the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI always do the thing.\u201d\n\nHe squinted at me. \u201cYou always do a version of the thing. Do the thing. Also there was a complaint.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout the way you look at the anchor.\u201d\n\nI laughed even though he wasn\u2019t joking. You have to understand, in our museum the anchor was both a talisman and a magnet for nonsense. People came and laid their hands on it like it might cure something. A couple got engaged in front of it once, and she said yes but the look in her eyes was a no wearing a yes\u2019s clothes, and I bet I am right about that. I had been known to look at it too, to stand there and imagine all the seas it had knifed through. Also, the anchor looked back. It did. It knew when you knew it.\n\nI tried not to think about invisibility. I failed pretty fast. At ten, while the school kids were on their second set of questions (\u201cBut why is a boat?\u201d asked a boy with one shoelace undone), I slipped away towards the back, beyond the rack of whistling lifebuoys. You couldn\u2019t go fully out of the public area, not without Graeme barking, but there was a curve of wall by the diorama of seabirds where you could stand and not be anyone\u2019s immediate problem.\n\nI breathed. The hiss was shy in the daytime. I had to coax it. In for six, hold for two, out for six. I let the weight of my arms drop, my knees unlock, my jaw soften. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re trying to do yoga without a mat,\u201d Miri would have said, if she\u2019d been there. I softened more. There was a crinkle at the edges of my vision, a curtain being drawn slowly so you wouldn\u2019t notice. For half a second everything grew far away and bright at once. My skin goosebumped, fine hairs philosophised.\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d said someone tiny.\n\nI startled. A little girl in a faded pink jacket, face the shape of a full stop, had sidled up. Her teacher was herding the rest away from the anchor with the resigned energy of someone whose lunch had a definite time. \u201cSir, can you see my brother? He said he would hide. He went this way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014 I don\u2019t\u2014 I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d I began, as if my tongue had been swapped with a borrowed one. \u201cWe don\u2019t play hide-and-seek in the maritime gallery.\u201d\n\nShe blinked. \u201cWe do.\u201d\n\nAnd she ran off, and I watched her ponytail be entirely visible, and decided that maybe my gift, if it was a gift, was nothing at all. I went and helped the weary teacher herd the kids into the room with the bottled ships. One boy tried to put his finger in a ship and looked at me with a grin that promised future crimes. I smiled back because I remembered my own certain grin. Then the day wore on and so did I.\n\n\u201cStill weird?\u201d Miri asked that night, when we were both pretending we weren\u2019t too poor for takeaways by frying onions until they believed they were something else.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, pushing onions around the pan so they wouldn\u2019t burn even though they always burn exactly the same anyway. \u201cBut\u2014 okay, don\u2019t laugh. I think I\u2026 did something with my hand. Invisible. Not like magic. I don\u2019t believe in magic. Something physics-y. There\u2019s this sound I hear and if I breathe the sound does\u2026 something. Maybe it\u2019s a migraines. Migraine? I dunno the plural.\u201d\n\nMiri didn\u2019t laugh. Even her mouth didn\u2019t move. She had this way of paying attention that made you want to confess your worst bit because maybe she\u2019d keep it safe. \u201cInvisible,\u201d she repeated. \u201cLike, gone. Or like fuzzy at the edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cGone but the air knew it. Does that make sense? Probably, yeah-nah.\u201d\n\nShe put the lid on the pan, turned the heat down so the onions wouldn\u2019t turn on us. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. But a lot of things don\u2019t and then they turn out to be true.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou believe me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet. But I'll hold it as a maybe.\u201d\n\nThat night I sat on the floor of my room, back propped against the bed, and breathed. It takes time to teach your body a new trick. The hiss thin as floss. My chest stubborn. A draft sneaking under the door. Miri moving cups in the kitchen like she was trying to rearrange the whole shape of fate by making a better shelf. A car alarm starting and stopping like a bad joke. Gradually, though, the room found a tune. My breath rode it. Somewhere behind my eyes a smudge of light darkened, if that is a thing that can happen.\n\nI looked at my left hand, the unfaithful one. I told it, without words, this: It\u2019s okay to go. It\u2019s okay to not be here. It\u2019s okay, but not forever. Not always. It felt stupid and also true. My fingers loosened their loyalty. The outline of my ring finger went weary. A small moth that had been bumping itself against the wall stopped, as if I\u2019d turned down the colour in the room and it needed to recalibrate. I pressed my left palm against my right forearm just to be sure. I felt skin on skin and also the absence of something, the shadow of contact. The weird tingle when a sleeping limb starts to return to you after being stone and rope.\n\n\u201cHoly,\u201d I whispered, straight to the floorboards, so the house would hear that I had noticed it. And then my hand, half gone by my own count, slid into full nothing. There\u2019s a specific fear in that moment. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying or more in charge of their own abences than I am. It wasn\u2019t like a party trick. It was like stepping off the side of yourself and hoping there was still a side to step back to. I counted out loud without meaning to. \u201cThree. Four. Five.\u201d Because I needed numbers to build me a shelter. I breathed and felt the hiss pluck at me and I let it.\n\nWhen I brought my hand back it came slow, like a thing returning from a long walk, slightly abashed about having left. My palm was clammy. The room seemed to swell and settle. I was dizzy and not. Fear braided with something like joy. I laughed. Not the right laugh. It came out too loud, too sharp. A neighbor banged on the plaster from their side. \u201cKeep it down,\u201d he yelled, a voice I\u2019d never had the right name for. \u201cSome of us have to\u2026 whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I said, to the wall and to the moth and to the part of me that had not asked for any of this. I had done a thing. Possibly a wrong thing. I slept on the wrong thing like it was a good pillow.\n\nIn the morning I made a mistake. It was small, but that\u2019s how mistakes arrive at your door. Miri was out early for a market where she sold mugs with waves. A note on the bench said Wish me luck you stoat. I ate toast and honey over the sink because, what, plates exist only in stories? Then I decided I wanted to try again in daylight because the way the sun angled through the lace of clouds made me feel softer, less cornered by the noise. I wanted to know if I was still a person with\u2014or was I a person with and without?\n\nThere\u2019s a little alley down from our street where the garages lean into each other like old men at the TAB. Cats fight there in the evenings. Kids chalk squares that blow away. The wind in that alley has a particular smell, thin and metallic like an old ten-cent piece. I went there because it was nowhere. I went there because no one would see if I turned my hand into an idea again.\n\nI was wrong. Somebody saw. Or didn\u2019t. I never learned which.\n\nI breathed. The hiss braided around me like an eel. The alley narrowed to just me and the chalk and a dented bin and a scrap of sky. I watched my wrist turn into something else. I was in two places: inside my body and pressed against the brick, hearing the brick groan. I kept count. I\u2019ve always been a counter. Stairs, ceiling cracks, the number of times the ferry blows its horn at two in the morning when the fog gets in the way. \u201cSix,\u201d I said to the alley. \u201cSeven. Eight.\u201d Part of my forearm unwilling to meet the light. Then most. Then all. My sleeve did an odd buckle and lay against nothing. It\u2019s a thing to see yourself not there. It\u2019s a stranger\u2019s thing you walk into by accident.\n\nFootsteps. I turned my head and the hiss snapped like wire breaking. A man with a dog at the far end of the alley stopped. He had the look of someone who always goes for a walk at that time whether it rains or boils. The dog did that curious lean dogs do when they\u2019re deciding whether to bark or apply for a job. They both looked at me. Or they both looked at where I would be, the outline of me visible mostly by my own fear, by the way the slightly damp air held its breath around me like plastic wrap.\n\nI don\u2019t know what they saw. I know I froze. Freezing is a way of speaking to danger as if danger listens. I took two short breaths without counting. Idiot. The hand, without permission, stayed gone. The dog whuffed and wagged a bit, as if it smelled something interesting and not new, the way you might smell the sea if you had lived all your life inside it. The man squinted. \u201cMorning,\u201d he said, in that Wellington way like you\u2019re a neighbor until proven otherwise.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d I said back before my throat remembered it was attached to a person, and my voice made a sound. He nodded, not strange at all, and went on past. The dog looked back with those velvet eyes. As soon as they turned the corner my breath roared into me like I\u2019d been underwater. My hand came back with a sting all the way up my arm, pins and needles and a thousand small apologies.\n\nAt work that day nothing stayed where I put it. I knocked over a jar full of old nails stoically labeled Nails, old. I bumped my hip into a case. It didn\u2019t break. I got told off anyway. \u201cYou reading?\u201d asked Graeme, catching me looking at a card beside a photo for too long. \u201cThey\u2019ve been read already.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho did the reading, though?\u201d I asked, because sometimes my mouth is a badly trained creature.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, and went back to his spreadsheet like the ocean whose anchor we were bored of did not exist.\n\nAt lunch I texted my friend Jace, who fixes bikes in a shop in Aro, and who liked me enough not to ask me to talk about anything emotional. I wrote, You ever have that thing where you think you\u2019re not all there. He wrote back, Hangover? I wrote, No. Like actual literal. He wrote back a photo of a derailleur remarkable for being a derailleur and then, You coming Saturday? Band\u2019s playing. Bring Miri. It\u2019s weird time again. I said maybe. He sent the shrug emoji. I imagined telling him. Then I imagined him laughing and not meaning to. I put my phone in my pocket and took it out again. The world didn\u2019t help by being the world.\n\nIt was Miri who saw the rub of it, of course. Miri collects rubs and rubbings, she could have been a detective if the world paid detectives in cups of tea and boxes for things. That night, after a day of being scolded by my boss and smiled at by a life buoy and tolerated by a ship in a bottle, I stood in the hall and looked at my left hand like it was a piece of someone else\u2019s absentminded sculpture. Miri flicked on the hallway light without warning and caught me.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, not unkind.\n\n\u201cStretching,\u201d I lied and showed her my palms like maybe there would be calluses to prove something.\n\n\u201cDo it again,\u201d she said. Just like that. \u201cDo the thing you\u2019re not mentioning.\u201d\n\nI love and hate her for the way she knows. \u201cI didn\u2019t say\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d she said. \u201cYou breathe different. And someone emailed me from the Naenae school to say thanks for the tour, but also that the man at the bird wall went pale like he\u2019d misplaced his soul.\u201d\n\nI sighed. \u201cI can make my hand\u2026 I think I can make my hand not be. It\u2019s silly. It\u2019s a trick. I think it\u2019s the hiss in my ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d she said again. The light above our heads clicked and steadied. \u201cIf you fall over I\u2019ll catch you. Ish.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something about being watched that makes everything impossible and also necessary. I didn\u2019t feel shy with Miri exactly; I felt seen. I sat on the floor not because it was comfortable but because if my legs forgot me they couldn\u2019t take me down far. I breathed. She tilted her head towards the sound, as if she could hear it too in the bones of the house. \u201cDon\u2019t try so hard,\u201d she suggested, which is the most useless instruction and the only one that ever helps anything.\n\nSo I didn\u2019t try so hard. I let the breath make a quiet bridge. I felt the thread in my head hum, a kettle almost. My left hand went light. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, quietly. \u201cOkay.\u201d And then it wasn\u2019t there.\n\nI didn\u2019t look up at Miri\u2019s face. I didn\u2019t want to see fear or fake. I watched my absence instead like a coward. My sleeve lay against nothing again. I stuck my right finger through the place where my left palm should have been. The sensation was not-sensation and also filled with fizz. I looked up because it had to be done.\n\nMiri had her mouth open a little like she was going to whistle. Her eyes were too round. She didn\u2019t move. The unkind version of her smile was nowhere. Something softer was. It was not delight. Not quite. It was shock\u2019s cousin.\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t lying,\u201d she said, like she was adjusting her whole memory of me two degrees to the left. \u201cOh. Eli.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, because it felt like a thing for which an apology might be due, like playing with things you shouldn\u2019t in an old house.\n\nShe shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare be sorry. How long can you\u2014 are you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hand\u2019s got its own ideas,\u201d I said weakly. \u201cI can keep it for about thirty seconds at a go. Then it hurts. If I get scared it\u2026 comes back fast but I get dizzy and the ground tries to kiss me. I think someone nearly saw me in the alley. The dog saw me or didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe lowered herself to the floor until she was cross-legged, palm on the carpet like her hand needed to show the carpet something. She blew her cheeks out like she was a kid again and thinking too hard. \u201cRight. Pros and cons.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making a list?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. Pro: you can avoid small talk. Con: you might not come back. Pro: Halloween sorted for life. Con: creepy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cHelpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I\u2019m being serious,\u201d she said, seeing my flinch. \u201cWe need to understand it. Hear me? Not make it stop. Understand. Because if it exists anyway and you don\u2019t look at it, it still exists. It doesn\u2019t go away because you put your head under the duvet.\u201d\n\nI nodded. She was right about that. She\u2019s right about a lot of things. It\u2019s infuriating.\n\nShe put out her hand; I put my right one in it. She squeezed. \u201cPromise me something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell Graeme.\u201d\n\nOh I laughed. It came out the right shape this time. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell Graeme if I\u2019d found Atlantis under the stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise me something else then.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it alone if you can help it. If you\u2019re going to\u2026 go. Let me know. I\u2019ll sit there pretending to do crosswords and I\u2019ll stick your shoe under the couch so you can\u2019t go far.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy shoe?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor. Shush.\u201d\n\nWe sat on the floor for a while, hands visible, food cooling in the kitchen, the light making a buzzing sound like it was a small person with a loose tooth. The house shifted. A siren went past somewhere far enough away we didn\u2019t need to think of anyone we love. The hiss in my head moved closer and further like a tide.\n\n\u201cDoes it sound like anything?\u201d she asked, eyes closed like she could see better that way.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like\u2026 do you know the sound a fence makes when the wind goes through the wire?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a hum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThinner than a hum. More like\u2014 you know when a glass is right on the edge of cracking and there\u2019s that note it finds? Hi\u2014 no. Actually\u2026 like when you\u2019re in a field far from anywhere and there\u2019s still this electricity in the air. Like that, but in my head.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, eyes still shut. \u201cI don\u2019t hear it. But I can almost. My ear\u2019s doing a tick thing. Maybe that\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something,\u201d I said, with a certainty that surprised me. \u201cI don\u2019t know what yet.\u201d I paused. \u201cDo you think I should see someone? Like, a doctor again? Or a priest maybe? Or a\u2026 I don\u2019t know the word for a person who deals with people who go away without leaving.\u201d\n\n\u201cA therapist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you should see me. Because I\u2019m cheaper. And because if you say church I\u2019ll laugh and then regret laughing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I said again, and meant it more and less at the same time.\n\nShe reached over and tugged at the cuff of my jersey. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry for being a bit magic,\u201d she said and then, because she could hear how the word made me flinch, added, \u201cOr for being good at breathing weird. Tell you what. Tomorrow I\u2019ll come to the museum and stand near the seabirds and you can do it and if you faint I\u2019ll get you a glass of water and a lie down.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraeme will have an aneurysm.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraeme has had an aneurysm brewing since 1994, I reckon.\u201d She mirth-snorted and then sobered. \u201cEli. Be careful. If you die of this, Mum will kill me.\u201d\n\nI promised, not very convincingly, and we ate the cooled food like it was exactly as we wanted it.\n\nIf this was a story that wanted to go neatly, then the next day I would have turned my whole self off like a lamp, and Miri would have clapped politely, and we would have walked home in the wind talking about what it\u2019s like to live in a body you can open like a curtain. It wasn\u2019t that story. It was this one.\n\nThe next morning dawned with a foolish amount of clarity, sunlight breaking on everything like crockery. Miri came down to the waterfront in a jacket too thin for the air because she\u2019s stubborn about seasons; once it\u2019s officially spring she wears spring like a dare. She waved at me through the glass when I was meant to be at the front mopping for show; I waved back with a small freaked-out flourish. She held up an imaginary sign: Steady. I grinned and made the universal sign for calm down by flapping my hands like a man who cannot calm down.\n\nGraeme said, \u201cFamily on the floor again, Eli?\u201d as if our blood had spilled and stained something.\n\n\u201cVolunteer audience,\u201d I said. \u201cKeep me honest.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t like that at all, the honesty part. He moved away in a hurry, the way people do who can\u2019t chew their own truth.\n\nAt eleven-thirty, after the school group had had their turn with the anchor and the anchor had ignored them as it ignores everyone, after a German couple had asked me if the building had ever been a church and I had said no and watched them make it be a church anyway, after a woman with an American voice had asked where the toilets were like I was the keeper of the hole in the world, I slipped to the bird wall. Miri drifted too, not obvious, looking as if she were trying to read the plaque about gannets, which she could not care about. She positioned herself a metre away, hands in pockets.\n\nI breathed. The hiss had been with me all morning like a thread you can\u2019t pull because it will unspool something important. I softened my jaw. I counted. I let the building sit on my shoulders like a cloak. I looked at nothing in particular. If you look at something too hard it starts to bleed into every other thing. I wanted to avoid that. I wanted to go absent without causing an actual emergency.\n\nThe left hand went. It went easier than before. It liked being gone, I could tell. Then the wrist. I kept breathing. My shirt sleeve fell in a way that made no sense, as fabric fought physics and lost to the invisible. My forearm said, later, and stepped away, so to speak. I reached out with my right fingers to the place where I had been. It was like touching smoke. People moved through the room oblivious to the way I had partially opted out of being. The ferry in the harbour hooted twice, and someone dropped a coin and didn\u2019t pick it up.\n\nMiri didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t gasp, didn\u2019t helpfully explain me to anyone. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other and I watched as if that was the most exceptional thing in the room. I tried for my shoulder. I shouldn\u2019t have. It wasn\u2019t ready. The hiss bit. The world did a quick swivel. For a second I thought I\u2019d actually fallen but then I realized it was the other thing, the tilt before the fall. My breath lost the rhythm. The left side of my torso flickered. A child clapped because flickering is clappable. Graeme called my name like it was a tax he had to pay.\n\nAnd then the worst thing happened. A woman watched me. Not in the vague museum way people watch because they\u2019re trying to figure out where to rest their eyes. Really watched. She had a sunhat in her hands like she didn\u2019t trust it on her head. She had the air of someone who\u2019d come to look at ships and had found, to her disappointment, that ships are just ships. She watched the place where my arm should have been and wasn\u2019t, and her face said the grown-up word for why for the first time in twenty years. She made a small movement like she was going to say my name, a name she did not know.\n\nThe sound that came with that movement hurts to remember. It was inside my skull and somehow in the room, a high thin note that made the lights complain. Not like my hiss. Like the malicious cousin of it. It made a man in a suit wince without knowing why. It made the German couple cover their mouths as if someone had farted. The woman with the sunhat blinked three times and turned away, and I knew with a certainty that takes your feet out from under you that she had turned towards the door not because she didn\u2019t want to see but because she wanted to never have seen. Not everybody will be supportive. You learn that as a kid and then you learn it again every time you show your weird to the world.\n\nMy arm slammed back into place with a full-body flinch. It hurt. Not bone hurt. Nerve hurt. Like a thousand small doorbells in my skin all going off at once. I gripped my left elbow with my right, which doesn\u2019t do anything but tells your body you\u2019re here now. The room did a jump cut, then steadied. I found the shape of my breath and made it low and less interesting. I smiled, the practiced employee smile. \u201cHi,\u201d I said to no one. \u201cWelcome.\u201d\n\nMiri, bless her, became very interested in a picture of a shearwater doing something shearwatery. She did not look at me. Her profile was the face of a saint who has decided to survive. Graeme walked over like he\u2019d heard but not believed his name being called, and said, \u201cEverything is all right here,\u201d as if saying so makes it so. The woman with the sunhat left. The ferry hooted again, less kindly. I ached in places you don\u2019t name.\n\nIn the staff room later, under a poster about not eating other people\u2019s lunches that had evolved into a legal document, I had my head on the table. Miri sat next to me, not touching, like a guard dog that didn\u2019t want to be trained. She put a mug in front of my face. \u201cTea,\u201d she said. Then, after a beat, \u201cYou made a noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made a noise? The lights made a noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made a noise. A high one. It stabbed my ear. Hurt like when the bus brakes and squeals. Like the sound your hand was making invisible but outside. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Yes. Kind of. I didn\u2019t\u2014 I didn\u2019t plan it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSound is your thing. Maybe you can\u2026 contain it. Or not be so loud.\u201d She rubbed her earlobe absently. \u201cMy ear\u2019s still weird.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, and this time I was sorry for that.\n\n\u201cStop apologising. No, sorry. Do apologise. But also this is not your fault. You are allowed to learn.\u201d She took a sip of my tea, because that\u2019s how we are, honestly. \u201cAlso. People are not always going to clap. Did you see that woman? She did that thing where she turns the part of her brain that sees off ratchet quick and goes back to ships. Poor her.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t poor her.\u201d\n\nShe closed her mouth. \u201cOkay. Poor none of us then. Just\u2014 we cannot make this nice for everyone.\u201d\n\nI wanted to make it nice. Wanted to be the kind of phenomenon you can post about with a lot of exclamation points and little sparkles. Instead I was the wrong sort of noise in a room that asked for hush.\n\nBy the time my shift ended, the hiss had settled into an almost companionable thing. I walked home slowly, stopping at the dairy for milk and a bag of chips that tasted like salt and more salt. The evening had gone back to its default setting of wind and complaint. Light on the hills like someone had ironed it out flat. My arm was ordinary again. When I got to the flat, a note on the table said at Jace\u2019s gig and then, in Miri\u2019s quick slanted hand, You should come if you can be a person. I laughed and folded the note into a boat, an old habit that didn\u2019t save people and never would.\n\nI didn\u2019t go to the gig. I sat and listened to the hiss like it had secrets that would be polite enough to reveal themselves if only I sat still enough. I did the breathing. I did not make anything disappear. The house felt too full of neighbors and small rooms and plumbing declaring itself. At ten Miri came back with her hair smelling like smoke and bass and said, \u201cJace says he loves you, in the non-weird way. He also says you owe him ten bucks for that time he got you into San Fran for free. He keeps accounts in his heart in a very annoying way.\u201d\n\nI smiled because that was a gift. \u201cTell him I love him back. In the same currency.\u201d\n\nShe flopped on the couch and pulled her boots off with that noise boots make when they have had a long day of being boots. \u201cAlso he says I have to buy these stupid earplugs because he\u2019s worried about my hearing. Which is fair. But also my ears are\u2026 I dunno, they\u2019re like anxious bees now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of me,\u201d I started.\n\n\u201cBecause of everything. The world is loud, Eli. You just happened to be\u2014 you\u2019re like. Oh I can\u2019t. I need to sleep. I\u2019m inventing metaphors I can\u2019t drive. Night.\u201d\n\nI went to bed and let the sentence about earplugs hover. It was a small sentence. It would turn out not to be small at all. But that is for later, because stories have laws you can only find in the middle of them.\n\nIn the week that followed, I did two foolish things and one smart thing. The foolish things: I tried to make my whole arm go in the alley again and nearly threw up when it half did. I told Jace, who didn\u2019t laugh, but said, \u201cOkay,\u201d in that lowered voice men use for astonishment, and then he hugged me and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me more or I\u2019ll break. I\u2019m delicate.\u201d He was not. He was loud and deeply good. When I reached to show him, to prove it, he held up both hands like a man stopping traffic and said, \u201cNot here. Not now. I haven\u2019t got the brain for it yet.\u201d He left and his leaving left a shape in the room.\n\nThe smart thing: I let Miri teach me how to be less noise. She bought a little metronome cheap at the op shop, the kind piano students used to hate. We put it on the table. We watched it tick back and forth like a pendulum that believed in itself. I breathed to that. We experimented with the breath counts. We did not make me go. We did not put me to the test. We made a container. It was the first time in my life I had not rushed a new talent to the stage and demanded applause.\n\nIt was something close to enough. Not the same thing as enough. But close.\n\nAnd then, because you cannot keep the world out even if you\u2019re very, very good at hiding, the world came in anyway.\n\nGraeme called me into the office he\u2019d fashioned out of the cupboard behind the stuffed marlin. There was a chair if you were tiny and liked pain. He gestured at it. I leaned on the doorframe and pretended my spine belonged to me. He did not offer to let me be at ease. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some visitor feedback,\u201d he began, and as if he\u2019d summoned her with that phrase the woman with the sunhat walked past the door in my memory and glanced in and did not see me. \u201cSome of the younger visitors are finding the\u2014 how to put it\u2014the atmosphere of the museum unsettling. There have been reports that a member of staff is\u2014\u201d he flipped through papers he\u2019d printed as if printing words makes them truer \u201c\u2014doing tricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cleaning,\u201d I said, because it was true enough to put on a badge. \u201cSometimes cleaning looks like other things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Board was here yesterday,\u201d he said, as if that constituted a plague. \u201cYour posture was\u2026 you were breathing in a manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise to stop breathing,\u201d I said and the part of my brain that claps when I make a good joke clapped. The rest of me groaned.\n\nGraeme stared. Then he did a thing that surprised me. He took his glasses off. He rubbed the bridge of his nose. He looked my way but not at me. \u201cEli,\u201d he said, for the first time in years like my name was not a label but a call. \u201cWhatever\u2026 interest you have in\u2026 bodily peculiarities\u2026 keep them for after hours. Or take some leave. Or talk to\u2026 somebody. I need this place to be a place. Not a circus.\u201d\n\nIt hit me a beat later, the way kindness always does when you\u2019ve trained for reprimand. I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014 I\u2019ll go quiet.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do,\u201d he said, glasses back on, armour smoothed. \u201cAnd make sure the anchor\u2019s chain is properly polished. It gets\u2026 fingerprints.\u201d\n\nOn the way home I stopped by the water because that is what you do here when your head is a house full of bees. I watched the ferry come in and the little blue boats flicker around it like birds around a whale. I listened to a bus bellowing three streets away. I didn\u2019t try to disappear at all. I stood and let myself be this one shape in this one place. The wind did its usual. Someone\u2019s child dropped an ice cream and announced the tragedy to the elements. The hiss in my head did its thread thing, but it didn\u2019t have me. Not like before.\n\nWhen I came in the flat, Miri was at the table with a white box open like a treasure chest. Inside the box nestled little orange cones that looked like cartoon carrots. She lifted one between two fingers. \u201cEarplugs,\u201d she said, in the tone you use when you name a weapon. \u201cIndustrial grade, but cute.\u201d\n\n\u201cJace told you to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJace told me to, but also I thought\u2026 maybe this is how to make your noise be yours. If I can\u2019t hear it, or if the world can\u2019t hear it, maybe it\u2026 I dunno. Maybe it will let us have peace.\u201d She smiled in a way that made me ache, because there are small acts that are big. \u201cAlso, they were on special. Two-for-one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a spare?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne is for the person who lives in our house and occasionally leaves the room without getting up.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, and the shape of the future shifted two degrees. \u201cOh.\u201d",

                              "content": "The cones were soft in the hand, little ridged carrots that promised to blunt the world. I rolled one between thumb and forefinger until the foam warmed and gave way, watching it remember and forget its own shape the way some people forgive. Miri had tipped the whole lot onto the table and they made a small orange drift, a pile of tiny safety gear that looked like a joke until you needed it. She nudged one my way with the back of her knuckle and then another, and there was something ceremonial about it, like we were laying out tools for a job neither of us had a name for yet.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re cute until they aren\u2019t,\u201d she said, which was how she felt about a number of things that turned useful. She had tied her hair up in that scarf again and the colour made me think of eucalyptus leaves bruised between finger and palm, that odd blue-green that keeps its own counsel. \u201cYou first or me first, Mr Invisible Man,\u201d she added, and her mouth did a small curve that was not exactly teasing.\n\n\u201cMe first,\u201d I said, although I wasn\u2019t sure whether I meant me wearing them or me going. I pinched one, made a torpedo out of it, and slid it into my right ear, the squish and then the slow bloom of pressure familiar from long flights I couldn\u2019t afford anymore. The left followed, and the room went fluffy around the edges, as if someone had put a pillow between me and everything else. The hiss didn\u2019t move away with the outside world. If anything, it came closer, not louder but more itself, less complicated by traffic and water pipes and Miri\u2019s spoon against the side of a cup. It was like finding a river by cupping your hands around your ears; you didn\u2019t conjure the river, you just stopped other sounds from getting jealous.\n\n\u201cYou look like a bouncer,\u201d Miri said, leaning back to see my profile. She was close enough that I could feel the warmth of her through the air, the way a fire tells your skin a story without touching it. \u201cTell me if you feel sick or if you turn grey. You do grey before you do green and it\u2019s not flattering.\u201d\n\nI breathed because that was what my body had taught itself to do when it didn\u2019t know any other way to proceed. The metronome ticked between us where she\u2019d put it, rescued from the op shop and cleaned of an old child\u2019s resentment. Tick, tock, tick, tock, and my ribs found a way to match it without quite obeying. The hiss braided through the beat, a river and a stick thrown across it, and I tried to let that thin bright thread be the thing that held me while also letting me go.\n\nMy left hand went quick, eager, a dog that knows where the beach is. The earplugs coddled the outside world and the pressure inside my head shifted one click, like a radio changing stations without telling you why. The sleeve on that side softened, then misbehaved, folding where there was nothing to fold around. I kept my breath small and courteous. Miri had put her plugs in too and she watched me with a calm that wasn\u2019t fake, her mouth pressed flat because inside the quiet she could hear her own blood sing, maybe, and she wasn\u2019t rejecting it.\n\n\u201cAnything?\u201d she asked, and even with the plugs her voice got through, because some voices move like that, through bone and memory. She didn\u2019t need to be loud to be heard by me, not just because her mouth was the one I\u2019d learned to watch for my name but because when the world is muffled you start to hear in other ways. Her hands were flat on the table and the way she pressed her thumbs into the wood was a question all by itself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 cleaner,\u201d I said, and it was odd to talk about a sound as if it had dirty edges. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to fight. I don\u2019t think the outside squeal will get out. Or if it does it will be\u2026 small. Like a knife you keep inside a drawer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall knives are still knives,\u201d she said, with the practical cheerfulness she wore when she was trying not to be dramatic. She reached out, not to touch the weird place where my hand wasn\u2019t, because she had learned that touching absence is like poking a bruise, but to rest her fingers against my wrist where I was still present enough to meet her. \u201cIt\u2019s better, though. It\u2019s kinder to everyone, including your useless boss.\u201d\n\nI held for a count I had not picked so much as fallen into. Twelve, a pause that felt like standing on a step you cannot see, then thirteen. My forearm agreed to be not-here and my elbow became a rumour, and that was further than I\u2019d meant to go at the table with orange cones between us and the kettle warming itself for a second boil. There was no slam back. There was a slow tide. When I let it reverse the water didn\u2019t slap the sand so much as return the shoreline to its old argument with the rocks. When I looked I could see where I had been absent, not a mark but a sort of dent in the air, the way you can tell something heavy sat on a cushion even after it\u2019s been lifted.\n\n\u201cThat was better,\u201d Miri said, releasing a breath I had not asked her to hold with me. She pulled one earplug out and rubbed her ear as if it were a small animal that had earned a treat. \u201cNo glass-shard note. My ear still did a little panic, but it passed quick. Less screamy. More\u2014 wind-chime adjacent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take wind-chime adjacent,\u201d I said, suddenly giddy with the relief of not having hurt her and not having broken the room. The hiss had a smugness to it now, like it had won a tiny game and was waiting for me to notice. \u201cDoes it feel different for you with the plugs in when I go?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the pressure changes and then changes back, like the weather stopped by for a second to see if we wanted anything,\u201d she said, thoughtful as if she were tasting a stew and trying to name the one spice it needed. \u201cLike when the front door opens down the hall and the air says, oh, and then forgets. You\u2019re not a storm, Eli. But you\u2019re a bit like the edge of one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been called worse things,\u201d I said, and I made myself laugh at my own joke so that she wouldn\u2019t have to. The orange cones looked ridiculous on the rimu, bright punctuation for a sentence the house didn\u2019t know how to finish.\n\nWe experimented for an hour, like a school project nobody else had assigned. We tried with only me plugged and then with only her, and then without, and each choice made the room into a slightly different room. With both of us plugged, the outside squeal didn\u2019t show up at all, and the inside thread came braided with something lower and slower, a bass line that I hadn\u2019t felt before, as if the building had its own hum and would allow me to hear it if I took away my own impatience. With only her plugged, the squeal came faint and sharp and then tucked itself back like a needle in a pin cushion, still capable of hurting someone careless, but unlikely to take out a whole ear. With neither of us plugged, the kettle of course chose that moment to boil and we abandoned the test to pour tea and watch the steam make quiet snakes.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot like when Nana\u2019s hearing aids used to go off,\u201d I said, watching the steam because it let me talk without looking at her. The hearing-aid squeal had been part of my childhood soundtrack, all those summers of Nana in her chair by the window with a book upside down and a biscuit on a plate she forgot to eat. \u201cShe\u2019d put her hand up like the queen to stop it and we\u2019d all pretend it wasn\u2019t happening even though it was happening in every room.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe used to tap them,\u201d Miri said, catching the handle of her cup with two fingers wrapped in a tea towel because she never learned to do anything in a way that didn\u2019t risk small injuries. \u201cShe\u2019d tilt her head like a bird and shush them with her thumb. You could try that with your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have hearing aids,\u201d I said, and then stopped because the sentence felt like it had missed its landing. \u201cBut there\u2019s something. The squeal is like\u2026 feedback. The sound going round and round finding itself and hating it. Maybe if I can\u2014 I don\u2019t know. Put a hand up to the right place.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the right place isn\u2019t your ear,\u201d she said, and then made a guilty face at her own cleverness. \u201cOkay, that was stupid. But what if it\u2019s the room? What if the room makes the noise worse or better, and we find the rooms that help.\u201d\n\n\u201cRooms as ear-shapes,\u201d I said, liking the idea more than I expected to. The museum had rooms that liked and disliked people in ways that were not polite. The hall with the life buoys whistled in some weathers and was a friend to nobody. The back wall by the seabirds kept secrets because that is what seabirds ask you to do, pretend you can fly and then keep it to yourself when you can\u2019t. \u201cWe can try after hours. We can ask the marlin nicely not to tattle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can bring the orange carrots and a thermos and some biscuits,\u201d she said, already making a list in her head with her mouth. \u201cWe can put a sign on the door that says Practising Quiet, which will make everyone angry even though it\u2019s reasonable. We can bring the metronome. We can\u2014 oh, I\u2019m bossing. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoss away,\u201d I said, because if anyone was going to make a plan that didn\u2019t end in blood or newspaper clippings it was her. \u201cI also want to try something stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a season of stupid,\u201d she said, but she was smiling with actual teeth. \u201cWhat stupid.\u201d\n\nI picked up one of her half-finished mugs from the shelf, the ones with the waves pressed into their sides that caught the light strange and made the tea behave like it had a mind to climb. The clay was chalky still, bisque-fired but not glazed, the sheen not yet in. I laid it on its side and then, feeling like the sort of magician nobody would pay money to see, I slid my left hand toward it and then into it as I did my breathing. The hiss rose to meet me with interest. The mug made the softest sound, like a thin bowl singing when you look at it too hard. The sleeve bunched; the bones of my hand did that not-being trick that still made my teeth tingle in sympathy even when I pretended I was fine.\n\nThe mug hummed again, barely there, a purr from an animal that had not known it could purr. It wasn\u2019t the screech. It wasn\u2019t the knife. It was a sound like somebody being spoken to from the other side of the wall by someone who intends kindness. I felt the invisible part of me push against the inside curve and the clay did not mind. It welcomed me the way water had welcomed a pebble when we were kids and still put things where they shouldn\u2019t go. I pulled back not because I was frightened but because there was a tenderness there I didn\u2019t want to bruise.\n\nMiri had put her ear down near it like a child, not touching, her scarf falling to the side in a soft collapse. \u201cIt sang,\u201d she said, and she didn\u2019t try to make the word better. \u201cYou made a cup sing without touching it with the side that touches. This is going to ruin me for regular ceramics. This is going to make me insufferable, actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t a model of sufferability before,\u201d I said, and we let the cups have their quiet and made ourselves tea in mugs that didn\u2019t want to be part of anything yet. The idea that clay was a kinder room than air to my not-hand was absurd and correct. If Nana\u2019s aids had squealed because the sound had nowhere useful to go, maybe mine needed a place that said, here, place it here, we can hold it and not be hurt.\n\nGraeme did not say yes to after-hours so much as not-notice that his keys were missing for long enough that we had the door open and ourselves inside. He had gone home early for once, muttering about his neighbour\u2019s hedge and the right to sunlight, and I did not feel guilty enough to stop. The building after dusk is a creature with a soft belly and bad eyes and a way of listening that you cannot buy. The life buoys were quiet. The marlin took its job as sentinel seriously, sorry about everything but not apologising. The anchor was a darkness pretending to be metal.\n\nWe put the metronome on the desk where Graeme pretended to write letters to the Board in longhand. We put the orange cones out like we were setting traps for silence, which in a way we were. Miri poured thermos tea and set a biscuit on a napkin she had probably ironed, because she is tragic in that way and I love her for it. We tucked plugs into ears and then took them out and agreed with our eyes not to talk for a bit and then put them back. The building breathed. When I went to the bird wall I could feel the shape of that breath, the way Older Places breathe in patterns people have forgotten to study.\n\nI tried there first because I am stubborn and because I had failed there last time. The hiss came in cooperative, the thread taut and pretty. I let the left hand go, courteous as we had practised, and then the wrist, and then the forearm, and the place where the shoulder begins. I didn\u2019t push. I didn\u2019t try to be a magician with a cape. I let it be as boring as a man doing a job well. The room did not punish me for good behaviour. It held me without asking questions and the squeal that had stabbed at the world before was like a mouse behind a wall being reasonable. Miri stood two short Miri-lengths away, hands in her pockets, rocking on her heels once in a while to tell me she was a metronome too.\n\nBeyond my own head\u2019s thin bright thread there was the building\u2019s hum, and beneath that a line so low I would not have heard it if I hadn\u2019t fallen half out of the usual world. It felt like the chain on the anchor had a note and it had been holding it since before the anchor had been lifted out of any water. I had been in here enough late nights to make that sentence sound like poetic nonsense, and still, it was there. It was a long held thing. It was a refusal to float off. It was the law the metal had made with itself when it was poured: you will bind and be bound, and in exchange you will sing very quietly to those who need it.\n\nI reached toward that in the way you reach for a light switch you can find in the dark with the heel of your hand. There was no flick, no flash, only a sense that something that had been waiting was no longer required to wait. The hiss in my head adjusted its coat. My shoulder did the thing it had been shy of doing in daylight and then more, the collar of my shirt half-limp where a body refused to be. I could feel the shape of me in the negative like a kid tracing her hand on paper and then colouring everything but the hand.\n\nThe marlin startled me by clacking against its mount with the softest clack and I had to laugh at myself because even not all here I reacted to a dead fish hanging like a sword on a wall. The laugh didn\u2019t tear the thread. The thread liked to vibrate. It was a string happy to be stroked, and when I thought that I felt something beside my own thinking brush back. As if there were another string in the room and it had said, hello, without words. It wasn\u2019t human. It wasn\u2019t not. It was like the breath the building had didn\u2019t end at the roofline and the city had its own breath and I had permission, for a second, to know it.\n\nA light on the far side by the lifts made a small alert beep because it was eight and it was wanting to tell someone they should have gone home. Miri flinched, a practical flinch, eyes flicking to the panel because she couldn\u2019t help but be in charge of situations we had invited in ourselves. I let the thread slacken and my shoulder came back in a wash this time, not a slap, and I bit the inside of my cheek because anything that makes you taste iron makes you feel like you are human again. My arm tingled in a million dots. My fingers remembered being attached with a rush that would have been obscene if it hadn\u2019t been relieved.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Miri said, and her mouth made the shape of a smile she restrained because she did not want to turn me into a trick even in her own head. \u201cOkay. Better. That was\u2026 you were half not-there, and you were breathing like a normal person in an ocean in his head. There was no screech, Eli. There was a pressure, and I can live with pressure. I cannot live with someone stabbing the inside of my ear with a knitting needle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recommend that either,\u201d I said, and tried to ignore the part of my mind that wanted a medal for doing something both absurd and not actively harmful to the public. The anchor did not move, obviously, because anchors are not for moving, but I could swear the chain lay slightly differently, as if it had sighed. \u201cThe anchor is my friend. I sound like a man who hugs trees, but I think the anchor likes the way I go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the anchor has a job and you make it feel like a star employee,\u201d she said, because she cannot help making things into people a little. She put her palm on the case, the respectful touch you give to something that would rather you didn\u2019t. \u201cWe can\u2019t always do it here, though. You can\u2019t live under the marlin. At some point we have to go to the supermarket and argue with the self-checkout.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say the word supermarket like that,\u201d I said, but I knew she was right. We had carved out a small pocket of workable in a building that had volunteered, in a sense, and the world outside was not going to bring us cups of tea every time I felt like becoming partial. Also, and this was ugly, I liked it. Not just the trick, but the feeling of my bones letting go of having to be bones all the time. There is a kind of joy in absence that you have to be careful with.\n\nWe tried the front hall for science because the front hall is a liar and pretends to be straightforward and then behaves like a funnel for any sound that wants to be a complaint. It was worse there. The squeal tried to get out like a mouse looking for a crack under a door. With the plugs in and Miri kind of sideways to me to make her smaller for it, we stopped it from becoming a problem quick. Without, even for a few seconds, the note wanted to make the lights flicker just to feel alive. It wasn\u2019t loud, not like before, but it made both of us grit our teeth and take the plugs as if they had been prescribed. We learned that lesson the way stubborn people learn; with our mouths tight and our eyes damp and a joke postponed for when we could stand upright again.\n\nBy the time we had recorded enough in our little non-notebook to satisfy her inner admin, it was late enough that the cleaner who hated us on principle because we dirtied the floors by walking had started on the bathrooms downstairs. We left a note for Graeme that said the vacuum cleaner is sulking, which was true because I had tripped over its cord and sworn at it in a way that made it weep. The wind outside had hauled itself up from the south just to remind everyone who lived here of their choices. The sky was not black so much as a deep, complicated blue. We walked home with our shoulders bent for rain that wasn\u2019t yet rain and could hear each other because we carried our quiet with us like a third person who didn\u2019t have opinions.\n\nAt the alley by the garages we both paused without meaning to. The chalk squares had ghosted themselves out, but there was a faint X left where some kid had marked treasure. A cat went past with the kind of disdain you have to be bred for. Miri looked at the dented bin and then at me and then at her own hands, the potter\u2019s hands with the places where clay had been inside the lines so long that the lines had made small hollows to welcome it. \u201cNot here,\u201d she said, and I didn\u2019t need the rest because the place had ears and we had learned some things that day about what to do and what to not do.\n\nWe slept inside our own rooms with the doors nearly shut, which was as close to privacy as the flat allowed. I lay with the hiss as if it were a dog I had adopted and was waiting to see if it would bite. It yawned in my head and let me scratch it behind the ears with my counting. When we were kids and the night was a black pond, Nana would sometimes leave her aids on by accident and the whine would go all the way through a dream and into morning, a thin measure of time that lived by itself. I hadn\u2019t thought of that in years. How you could hear a person\u2019s presence because of what they couldn\u2019t hear. How the things we think are our faults turn into lanterns in other rooms.\n\nIn the morning the world did that mean trick where it behaves normally to see if you\u2019ll relax. Toast that jumped when it wanted to. Shoes that had hidden themselves like they had a personality. Miri had her market again and her sign that said Handmade by a Person, which made me snort every time because who else was making sweet potato-coloured mugs in Wellington, actual dolphins. She put a pair of plugs in a tiny tin and clipped it to her keys as if they were medicine, because for her they were, now that my inside noise had learned to put on an outside coat now and then.\n\nAt work I took myself small. I pretended to love the anchor less. I made eye contact with the kids and rewarded them for not touching the ship in the bottle with stickers that said I Kept My Hands To Myself, which is a weird sentence to give to a child. I didn\u2019t go to the bird wall even though it had been kind. I went to the back room with the boxes that smell like old wood and older salt, and I did the saddest thing I have done so far, which is I put the orange cones in my pocket and did not tell anyone why my jeans had a lump.\n\nThe woman with the sunhat did not come back, because why would she, but a man who had once worked the ferries came in and stood with his hands behind his back like he had forgotten what it was like to have them free. He didn\u2019t speak right away and then when he did he told me about a time the fog came in like God had asked for privacy, and how they had to measure the passage between the buoys with their breath because the instruments fussed. \u201cWe used to whistle at the foghorn just to feel smaller,\u201d he said, and he laughed at his own young self in a way that was affectionate and a little disgusted. I liked him intensely for four minutes and then he wandered away to be sad by the life buoys because they are a good place for that.\n\nAt lunch I sat in the staff room and looked at the poster about other people\u2019s lunches and did a very odd thing. I cupped my right hand over my right ear the way Nana had done and gave the world permission to be quiet for a count of eight. It didn\u2019t obey because it never does, but something about the cup against the bone changed the hiss\u2019s coat again. It rounded a fraction. It hesitated. It didn\u2019t want to go into feedback, which is what I was learning to call the outside knife. It wanted to be line, and lines are the kinder shape.\n\nI told Miri in the evening about cupping my ear and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to end up with one enormous forearm like a tennis player,\u201d because she refuses to be solemn longer than is strictly required for the maintenance of human relationships. Then she pulled her earplugs out of their tin and put them in, and we sat on the couch and watched a terrible television show with the sound off and invented better dialogue for all the characters. It\u2019s a trick to be a person and also be the person who is sometimes less, and that trick felt almost possible in that moment.\n\nWe didn\u2019t see the woman with the sunhat again, but two days later a postcard came to the museum addressed To The Man By The Birds and nobody laughed, which is a small miracle. It had a picture of the harbour from a stupid angle and on the back, in that rounded careful handwriting women develop when they\u2019re trying not to be themselves, she had written one sentence and then another. The first was, I am sorry for looking like that, and the second was, I heard a sound that reminded me of a dentist and I was brave anyway later in the day and ate a pear. Graeme passed it to me with two fingers like it might bite and I put it in my pocket as if it were heavy. After work I took it home and put it under the fridge magnet shaped like a long white cloud because we are cheap and obvious and couldn\u2019t be more pleased with ourselves.\n\nThe smart thing about the postcard was not the apology. It was the pear. The pear meant she had survived the sound and chosen sweetness anyway. The pear meant people bend and then they do ordinary acts to prove to themselves they have not broken. I stood in the kitchen with a pear of my own because the dairy had them and I am a tragic for signs. I ate it over the sink because I never use a plate if I can help it and the juice ran and the hiss in my head hummed and I did not vanish and the wind did its Wellington thing against the window and I thought, no, okay, maybe not a storm. Maybe something like weather, but in the small way, the way that lets you hang washing and take it in before it breaks you.\n\nThat night the ferry blew its horn twice and then once again, a pattern it doesn\u2019t often do, and I counted without trying because counting is how my head shapes things it can\u2019t otherwise hold. Somewhere far away, in a house that was not mine, a woman with a sunhat sat at a table and wrote a second card she would or wouldn\u2019t send. Somewhere in our flat, in the room with the half-moons of threw clay on the floor, Miri put orange cones in a tin and then in a bag because she is the sort of person who likes a bag inside a bag, and then she lay down and slept with one ear tuned in case my breath got itself into trouble.\n\nA week later Jace rang and didn\u2019t say hello, he just said, \u201cCome by the shop after six, I want to show you a thing,\u201d and then hung up because his whole life is leaving. I went because value for value and because he loved me in that way he said he did, the way that doesn\u2019t ask. The shop smelled of rubber and oil and men making the mistake of thinking they can outwit physics with their hands. He had a piece of chain in his hand, not fancy, a length of what had been a lock if you believed the label. He pressed it into my palm like he was a priest and I was a man who\u2019d done a terrible thing and was getting a small object to remind me not to do it again. \u201cFor your pocket,\u201d he said, not looking at me long. \u201cKeep you here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chain,\u201d I said, and he nodded like he liked that I knew what a chain was.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weight,\u201d he said, which is not the same thing and what he meant. He tightened a bolt on a child\u2019s bike and didn\u2019t ask and I didn\u2019t tell and I walked out into the wind with the stupid piece of chain in my pocket clinking against my keys and it was ridiculous and perfect. On the way home I walked past the place in the alley where the chalk had tried and failed to stay and I touched the chain and put my hand in my pocket and let the hiss be a line and did not go anywhere at all.\n\nThat was the day I started thinking, properly, not like a coward, about Nana\u2019s funeral and the way the minister\u2019s microphone had squealed when he got it too close to the speaker and how he had smiled and said, sorry folks, old friend, and then moved it two inches and the squeal had gone as if it had taken offence. The solution had been insultingly simple in the end. These things sometimes are. You move the thing away from the thing. You make a gap. You change the angle. You give the sound somewhere else to go. The trick is to do it without only half living. The trick is to become gap when you mean it and be solid when you mean that too.\n\nAll of which would have been noble and useful and maybe even a method if the next thing hadn\u2019t happened, which was that the power went out in the middle of a school tour and the emergency lights didn\u2019t come on and someone screamed because people scream when they can\u2019t find the edges of themselves. The storm had been practising all week at the far end of the strait. It had decided, in that arbitrary way storms do, that we were now interesting. The kids were playing with a display they weren\u2019t allowed to play with and the teacher had a face that asked for a break she would not get. The lights died like they had been shot one by one while standing in a row. Silence fell and then surged, because silence is not nothing, it\u2019s something that observes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d I heard myself say, which is a stupid sentence because you never do, and out of the dim I felt Miri\u2019s hand hook into my sleeve because she had come by to bring me a sandwich and an opinion, and then there were children and sea birds and the suggestion of an anchor and the hiss like a wire you could tune, and I thought, right, okay, then, and counted to six and held for two and not for much longer than that, because if you are going to be a person who steps sideways to help you have to remember the door back is always at least half locked.",

The power went out all at once, a curtain drop, not the stuttery kind that gives you time to make wishes. The seabirds went from specimens to silhouettes. Someone\u2019s phone made a small, startled chime and then died because phones are cowards. The teacher made the first sound after the dark, that thin strained \u201cOkay,\u201d you give a crowd when you\u2019re asking your own ribs to behave. I felt Miri\u2019s hand find my sleeve and hook there, a practical tether. Her fingers made an anchor of cloth. I squeezed back and took a breath that didn\u2019t belong to me and borrowed it anyway.\n\n\u201cHands on your buddy\u2019s shoulders,\u201d I said into the dark, projecting the way Jace does when he\u2019s trying to get a bar to hush without buying them another round. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a slow snake. No rushing. We\u2019re safe. You\u2019re with us.\u201d My voice was too calm. Fake calm is still better than the other kind. I could smell wet wool and lunchbox apples. A kid made a noise that wasn\u2019t crying exactly, a high leak of air that was on its way to being that. \u201cHey, mate,\u201d I said, and didn\u2019t say the part about how I\u2019d felt like that all week and survived it. \u201cHear that? The ferry\u2019s going to sing for us. We\u2019re going to sing back by walking.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the ferry that answered. It was the other note, the low line I\u2019d found under the museum like a seam. I had no right to ask it for anything and did anyway. I slid my left hand toward the anchor in the dark, knowing the room\u2019s shape without seeing because I\u2019d spent too many nights there to be a stranger. The hiss in my head tightened like a string when you twist the peg just enough and not one turn more. I didn\u2019t go. Not fully. I let my fingers thin, enough to slip into the chain\u2019s idea of itself, and then I plucked without plucking. Metal remembers being liquid; it also remembers being asked to hold. The chain answered with a note you don\u2019t exactly hear with your ears. It\u2019s a bone sound. It\u2019s a sound you feel in your wrist and your teeth and the place under your throat where your breath queues up.\n\nThe children went quiet in a way that had nothing to do with me being heroic. It was animal. Something big hummed and their bodies, which are smarter than their teachers about danger, leaned into it. \u201cFollow the quiet song,\u201d I said, because I didn\u2019t know how to say follow the thing that keeps ships alive. \u201cWe\u2019re headed to the front. Miri, you\u2019ve got the tail?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the tail,\u201d she said, and her voice was the voice of all the aunties, all the bosses. \u201cMiss? You and I can be outboard. Hands on little shoulders. You too, mate. Don\u2019t you go pretending you\u2019re above it.\u201d She had a kid by the collar and the kid made a huffy noise that meant obedience disguised as reluctance.\n\n\u201cWhat about the torches?\u201d the teacher asked, managing courtesy in a dark that wanted no part of it.\n\n\u201cOn it,\u201d I said, lying in the way that saves lives. I let the chain keep talking to the room. It thrummed very politely, like a bass player who knows the gig isn\u2019t theirs, and I took my hand back before my shoulder could be tempted to make a bigger poor decision. I cupped my right ear like Nana and the hiss rounded itself, a coin sanded at the edges, then I went for Graeme\u2019s cupboard behind the marlin, because if he hides anything useful it\u2019s behind the dead fish with the resigned expression.\n\nIn the blackout the marlin was a rumour at head level. I whispered \u201csorry\u201d to it because I am that kind of man and then banged my knee on the chair designed for a child with a grudge. The office door was sticky, a late-century door that thought it was a secret. I used my shoulder because you use what you have. Inside, the air smelled like paper going stale. I ran my hands along the shelf where the torches used to be, found nothing but forms and a spider that could have started its own union, and then saw the red glow of the keys cabinet, except the glow was a trick my eyes were playing because it was dark enough to invent glowing. The cabinet was locked. Of course it was. Graeme trusts locks the way some people trust saints.\n\nI had the length of chain in my pocket because I hadn\u2019t taken it out since Jace pressed it on me like a blessing. It knocked against my thigh now with a small, hardworking clink. I wrapped it once around my wrist, stupid superstition or good sense, and took one breath like a liar. The hiss went fine and tight. I didn\u2019t close my eyes because there was no point. I thinned my left hand inside my own sleeve and slid it through the cheap metal box the way a fish slides through a shadow. It felt like pushing into a story you weren\u2019t completely invited to. The key ring was easy: big plastic tags, the kind you buy in packs and never label properly. I curled ghost fingers around a likely one and pulled gently so I wouldn\u2019t hook the whole lot and announce my tricks to the marlin. The key came out like a coin from behind an uncle\u2019s ear. My breath stuttered, the squeal pressed for a moment at the edge of the room, thin knife testing the butter, and I cupped my ear with my right hand and lowered my head until the note thought better of it and went sulk in a corner.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d I said to the fish, to the cupboard, to my heart which was punting. Out at the seabirds, the chain\u2019s hum continued in a way that made me feel disloyal for having left it with a job. I unlocked the second cabinet, the one where Graeme keeps things he calls plant as if that will make them thrive. Torches, two of them, old but not dead. I smacked their bottoms like a man who does not believe in subtlety and they stuttered into cones of yellow. I took them and the key back to the dark.\n\nIn the dim, the museum was a cave with pictures of boats. The kids were a little river of backs. Miri had the last one by the collar still and the teacher had found her spine. \u201cSlow,\u201d she said in that school voice that is not a request. \u201cHands and eyes.\u201d I put a torch in her hand and one in Miri\u2019s and the relief that rolled through the little procession was bigger than the cones of light could justify. People will forgive almost anything if you hand them a tool.\n\n\u201cWhat about the door?\u201d someone said, because someone always says what about the door. The front was up a short flight and then through the foyer everyone thinks is a different building because of the tiles. In a blackout the automatic thing is to assume things are automatic. They weren\u2019t. The door was a heavy thing that wanted power and we had none to offer. I moved ahead and put my shoulder against it like it had insulted my wh\u0101nau. It gave grudgingly, a grumpy old man of a door. I told it to behave in the tone my stepfather used on dogs. It behaved just enough. A slice of day came in, slate-coloured and wet. The storm had rolled over the hill and parked on us with its handbrake up. Wind came at us like a thing that wanted to make a point.\n\n\u201cOn the count of three,\u201d I said to the teacher, because ceremony helps. \u201cOne, two\u2014\u201d and we pushed on two because three is for amateurs. The door opened enough to let a class snake though. The outside wasn\u2019t light exactly but it was not dark. In the doorway the wind made a noise like a woman with opinions. The parents with lunches were dots on the far side of the square. Someone from the ferry office was waving. The kids went out, counting themselves without being asked, \u201cone-two, one-two,\u201d the way they\u2019d been taught to cross streets and decades and rooms full of men. When the last little shoulder passed me I had that feeling I sometimes get that my job is actually to be the place people go around.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can get the emergency lights to\u2026 remember their job,\u201d I told Miri, because if I said fix I\u2019d jinx it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be noble,\u201d she said, not unkind. \u201cBe quick.\u201d\n\nI went back into the cave with the smaller torch chalking the air, thinking about everything I don\u2019t know about electricity and whether you can get electrocuted if the part of you doing the foolish thing is less than here. I promised myself that if there were any buzzing I would stop. I walked past the anchor and it hummed once like a person saying my name from another room and I touched the case as if patting a dog who\u2019d done well. The marlin watched me with its permanent death-face. The breaker box was in the staff corridor by the sink that never drains because old buildings like to keep a little of what you give them. The panel had a flap with a sticker that said Qualified Personnel Only which is a sentence that covers a lot of sins. I opened it anyway. Inside it was arranged in that bureaucratic logic that makes sense to someone somewhere. A line of switches. One heavy lever that said Generator, as if saying the name summoned the thing. The little stop-start button that had been bumped by a mopping bucket once and caused more excitement than any exhibition we\u2019d had that year. The emergency light circuit had tripped. It had that tiny look of guilt switches get when they\u2019ve done the wrong thing entirely in your absence.\n\nI put the chain into my palm again because the weight mattered. I put one earplug in with my mouth because my hands were shaking and my mouth fancied itself a helper. I hesitated for exactly the right amount of time to think of every person I love asking me not to be stupid, and then flipped the emergency line back. The panel made a polite click and the corridor did that hopeful glow that means batteries have remembered what they are for. Back in the gallery, above the seabirds, a thin rectangle lit like a cartoon. Not enough to make ships out of shadows. Enough to keep people from turning to ghosts.\n\nThe generator lever dared me. I didn\u2019t take the dare. The wind outside sounded like it could power a small town if you could get it to behave. I left the main as it was because sometimes leaving things alone is a skill. On the way back through the hall, the PA system hiccuped once and tried to clear its throat. Somewhere the radio upstairs that Graeme listens to when he says he\u2019s thinking attempted a static. The knife-squeal sniffed at the room like a rat. I cupped my ear and lowered my head and it passed, a small sharp thing that decided we weren\u2019t worth the trouble today.\n\nOut front the teacher had her hands full of thanks and stray children. Miri handed me half a sandwich she had meant for me anyway. Graeme appeared from somewhere like a man who has always been here and just forgot to tell you. His hair was at attention. His glasses were fogged. He looked around for someone to blame and found me, which is a talent. \u201cIncident report,\u201d he said, as if that were the first thing a person should say in a blackout in a storm with a class outside and the emergency lights now doing a creditable job. \u201cEverybody in staff room. After the\u2026 after.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got them out,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t say the anchor sang because there are limits to what a man can get away with under fluorescent light.\n\nHe took his glasses off and back on and couldn\u2019t find the sentence he wanted to use to be angry at me for not being at fault. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, and that one syllable did a lot of work. \u201cWell. Thank you. And also incident report.\u201d He shuffled away to find paper or a culprit.\n\nThe class teacher squeezed my arm like she was checking a melon at the market. \u201cYou were calm,\u201d she said. \u201cI appreciate calm. And the\u2026 sound. I don\u2019t know what that was. But thanks.\u201d She was about to ask me if that sound was part of the exhibition and then she saw my face and didn\u2019t. She took her small humans into the weather with a competence that made me want to sit down.\n\nMiri and I stood under the enormous overhang where the rain couldn\u2019t quite get us and shared the sandwich like we had invented hunger. The wind came in sideways and then the other sideways to make sure it had covered all angles. The ghost hum from the chain was still in my bones; I watched the rain hit the lip of the harbour and break and braid itself because water is better at choreography than people are. \u201cYou good?\u201d Miri asked around a mouthful of bread because she is an animal sometimes.\n\n\u201cI did a crime against electricity,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it was petty.\u201d\n\n\u201cPetty crimes save more people than grand ones,\u201d she said, and took the last bite meanly. \u201cMy ear\u2019s fine. It didn\u2019t do the needle. It did that thing where it thinks it\u2019s inside a shell. Manageable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get good at this,\u201d I said, and as soon as I said it the world put on its hat with the word hubris on it and we both knocked on the wooden bench without meaning to.\n\nThe incident report was a ritual dance in which you agree that everything happens in a straight line and is the result of choices that can be catalogued. I wrote sentences like Power cut at approximately 11:58 and Staff member retrieved torches and Assisted evacuation as if the building did not breathe and the anchor did not hold me in place with a hum. Graeme wrote his own version with the word protocol in it twice and the words staff conduct once, and I took that like a person takes weather. When it came to the bit about the emergency lights, he allowed, grudgingly, \u201cGood initiative,\u201d and made it sound like a diagnosis.\n\nBy the time the worst of the dark was over, the worst of the day wasn\u2019t. The storm sat and sulked on us all afternoon, tapping the windows like it had brought us a shameful amount of rain and wanted to be thanked. The generator finally decided to play its part with a cough that ran up the ducting and made the marlin look like it was trying to remember an old joke. We let the school groups be cancelled by someone else\u2019s email and kept the door half shut and told tourists gentle lies about flood risk. I went and stood by the anchor when nobody was looking and put my palm against the case again. \u201cCheers,\u201d I said to it quietly. \u201cI owe you something I don\u2019t know the name of.\u201d\n\nAt home the power had done that Wellington thing where it gives up on the suburbs it doesn\u2019t love and then changes its mind without apologising. The lights in our little street were on. Inside, the clocks blinked a time they didn\u2019t believe in and Miri lit the gas with a lighter held like a ritual. She set the orange cones down in their tin and looked at them as if they were sweets she shouldn\u2019t eat. \u201cI needed them less today,\u201d she said, proud and annoyed.\n\n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d I said, and the chain in my pocket had enough weight to make me stand up straighter. I set it on the hook by the door where we hang our keys, like a joke that had taken up a job. It looked silly. It looked right. I\u2019m learning those two things are often the same.\n\nSleep that night was the kind you pay for with a price you haven\u2019t quite counted. In my dreams the building had a voice that wasn\u2019t a hum anymore. It was a person with a very low voice telling me not to be afraid of being less. In the dream I nodded like a good student and then in the morning I wanted to argue, because being less, in day, has consequences that feel like you have to make tea for them. I sat at the table with a pear because of the postcard and a pen because of the incident report and watched juice drip onto the paper I wasn\u2019t writing on. \u201cDo you think this is\u2026 replicable?\u201d I asked Miri, who had clay in her hair and clay under her nails and a clay eye on me.\n\n\u201cWhat, you and your anchor and your choir of lights?\u201d she asked, amused enough that I didn\u2019t bristle. \u201cWe can find places that want to hold us. Rooms are ear-shapes, remember? There will be rooms that make you feel like a kettle and rooms that make you feel like a bass drum and rooms that make you feel like the space under a bed. We just have to learn the map.\u201d\n\nWe made a list because she is the sort of person who gets a glittering in her eyes when a list is required. The band rotunda down by Oriental\u2014the one that pretends to be new but is, at its heart, a circle for sound. The National Library reading room, if the security guard who looks like he regrets every choice he ever made lets us in long enough to feel the wood. The tunnel under Mt Vic, which is the wrong place for a lot of reasons, but people toot in it because otherwise they feel like they\u2019ve disappeared, and I was curious to learn whether I would love it or be made into mince by it. The church up the hill that nobody we know goes to but everyone thinks of when they think of quiet. Not to be disrespectful. To see what stone does with me when I am the size of a careful breath.\n\nWe started with the rotunda because it seemed least likely to end with us being told off by a man in a hi-vis vest. The wind was having a quieter day, still opinionated but less inclined to slap. The circle held our small sound in its hands and passed it round like bread. I stood at the centre and made myself not try, which is like telling a toddler not to drop anything. The hiss found the curve as if it had been looking for it. My left hand let go and there was no knife in the air, there was only a thin shimmering like heat on a road. The sound we didn\u2019t make made a neighbour for the sound of water on pilings. A jogger went through and didn\u2019t side-eye us because joggers have kingdoms you can\u2019t enter. A couple with chips sat outside and gave us a look that was friendly and decided we were buskers who hadn\u2019t committed yet. Miri made a tiny recording on her phone, not of the sound\u2014there wasn\u2019t much to catch\u2014but of the absence, the way the room\u2019s breath altered. Later she played it back and we both felt nothing and said \u201cweird\u201d and then laughed because trying to prove this to anybody at all would make us insufferable.\n\nThe tunnel was a mistake we made softly. We went on foot at a time of day drivers weren\u2019t all doing their Mt Vic toot-toot like it kept the freeway gods on side. The walls held their own damp. The tiles made their own echo of everyone who\u2019d sung the first bar of any song they thought matched the shape. I stuck a plug in just in case and took a breath and immediately felt the hiss try to go up and up like a balloon someone had let go of. \u201cNah,\u201d I said out loud to it, which made Miri snort, and we walked out into air and agreed that the tunnel is for car horns and mourners and people who like to hear themselves sure. Not for us.\n\nThe church surprised me. I thought stone would press me flat like a teacher\u2019s hand and say, that will do. The brass plaque at the door asked for silence like it was a tithe. We did the kid thing where you look at sainthood in windows and try not to compare it to anyone you know. In there my head did not make the bright thin line; it made a line you could hold. I didn\u2019t try to go because I am not a complete fool. I let the breath make a shape and then another and waited until the fierce part of me, the one that wants always to step, sat down and accepted a biscuit it didn\u2019t deserve. The old wooden pew had a note I could feel with my shoulder-blades. Later, on the steps, Miri said, \u201cThat was like Nana\u2019s living room if Nana had had a cathedral,\u201d and I said, \u201cAnd nobody made us fill in a form,\u201d and we both agreed not to be religious about it because life is hard enough.\n\nThe National Library was a no because the man at the desk had a face on him. We went into the atrium and stood near the Zealandia display because the takah\u0113 was there in poster form, and I tried a breath and got a spurt of squeal so fast and small it barely left my skull. \u201cNope,\u201d I said, and we went and got coffee from a truck and named birds we couldn\u2019t see instead.\n\nBack at the flat, Miri\u2019s mugs began to change shape without her asking them to. She started making little notches near the rim, meaningless if you looked, but when you blew across them with your mouth half a song they made a note like a reassurance. She pretended for a day or two it was an accident and then confessed. \u201cMy hands aren\u2019t interested in regular rounds anymore,\u201d she said, vexed but pleased. \u201cI\u2019m making rooms for your ridiculousness. I\u2019m going to be intolerable at the market, Eli.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be insufferable and rich,\u201d I said, which is the good kind of intolerable if you share. She began drilling tiny holes in handles and looking at me out of the corner of her eye for permission she didn\u2019t need. The mugs whistled if you put them down too hard. It should have been annoying. It was a house full of small anchors.\n\nGraeme, to my profound shock, did not call a meeting to discuss my behaviour. He printed out the incident report and put it in a folder and labelled the folder INCIDENTS and put it in the drawer you can\u2019t open without swearing. He did buy three new torches and lock them in a cabinet I now had the key to because I\u2019d rescued him once. He made a point, quietly, of telling me which staff were on inhalers and which child in the brochure photo had sensory issues so if we lost the lights again we did not lose our people. \u201cProtocols,\u201d he said, pretending not to be kind, and I said \u201cYeah,\u201d pretending not to be moved.\n\nA week of ordinary passed, which here means wind and coffee and three tourists asking where the earthquake house is. I didn\u2019t go in alleys and disappear on purpose. I worked, I counted, I put the chain in my pocket and took it out and placed it by the door like a talisman with grease on it. I tried once in the back room with the boxes just to see if the cardboard wanted me. It didn\u2019t. It made a papery fuss and then a spider asserted squatter\u2019s rights on my boot and I apologised to it for stepping there. The hiss and I had what I would call a truce. I didn\u2019t make it do party tricks if it didn\u2019t stab me. We were, for five days, a man and his unwanted but no longer entirely hostile guest.\n\nThen the weather, being itself, remembered we exist. The storm that had parked its one-tonne weight over Cook Strait rolled off and made room for all the people with kites. The sun came through the museum glass like a judgement. A family of five came in, the sort that looks like a magazine ad if the magazine is about sensible shoes. The youngest was a small person with the gaze of a god, three maybe, held together by a cardigan with sheep on it. She toddled to the anchor with that alarming dignity toddlers have and put both palms against the case. \u201cHello,\u201d she said to it, and I nearly cried because we never grow out of that, we just forget to do it out loud.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch,\u201d her mother said, not looking up from her phone, and the girl frowned and said, \u201cRude,\u201d and I went and cleaned a smudge that wasn\u2019t there so I could stand near a person being correct without being paid for it. The anchor thrummed once, as if in reply. So soft I wanted to claim I\u2019d imagined it. The little girl nodded like a woman hearing gossip she already knew. Sometimes the city offers you a piece of itself and expects you to have the manners to take it without making announcements.\n\nThe next thing that really happened wasn\u2019t about museums at all. It was about buses and their tendency to be barrels with wheels. I was on one, the No. 2 because the No. 1 had betrayed me by being early two days in a row, and we were up by the tunnel corner where everyone either honks or wonders what the honking\u2019s about. The driver braked hard to avoid a cyclist with a death wish or a god on his shoulder, and a woman in the front grabbed the pole and missed and did that graceless stagger we all dread. I went to grab her with my good manners and my ordinary body, and in the jerk of the bus my left hand went without meaning to. Not far. Enough that when my fingers found her elbow I felt it like you feel the side of a balloon. My palm fizzed. The woman looked at me because even if you don\u2019t see the trick your body knows when you\u2019ve been touched by weather and not by skin. For one horrible second I thought she was going to do the sunhat woman\u2019s look. She didn\u2019t. She said, \u201cThanks, love,\u201d in a Christchurch voice, and sat, and the bus went on with its mind humming about schedules.\n\nI sat too and stared at my hand like it was a child who\u2019d run into the street. The hiss in my head tried to be helpful and wasn\u2019t. The piece of chain in my pocket knocked lightly as if to say, I can\u2019t do everything for you. The bus went into the tunnel and everyone tooted except the driver, who is a professional and knows better. The sound cupped us and let us go. I breathed and counted and didn\u2019t move and the woman with the near-fall took a lolly out of her bag and unwrapped it with the careful relish of people who understand small sweetnesses.\n\nAt home I told Miri about the bus and she chewed the inside of her cheek until it let go of her. \u201cSo it wants you when you don\u2019t want it,\u201d she said, which is just bodies. \u201cMaybe your hand\u2019s learning your life without asking permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be consulted,\u201d I said, nettled and tired.\n\n\u201cSo would most of us about most of what our hands do,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay. New rule. Chain on the bus. Earplug in the left ear in public if you can stand it. And\u2014I can make you something.\u201d She went into her cupboard of horrors and came out with a strip of clay, half-dry, shaped like a thin cuff. \u201cLike a bangle but you won\u2019t look like a surfer. A band. With holes. If you slip towards gone and you\u2019re touching it, it\u2019ll sing. You\u2019ll know. I\u2019ll drill the tiny whistles. Your hand will have to pay attention to you to make the noise stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re giving my hand a time-out bracelet,\u201d I said, and felt ridiculous gratitude work its way up like a blush. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the weirdest people at the bus stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even close,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been to Kilbirnie on a Sunday. Please.\u201d She made a face at the clay like a parent with a bright child who will not sleep. \u201cAlso, if you hate it we can pretend it was an art school assignment I failed.\u201d\n\nShe fired it ugly and useful on purpose so nobody would ask if it was for sale. It looked like a bit of drainpipe with ideas. It fit. When I slid my fingers along it you could feel the air want to be something, like the room before a song. When I let my hand go a fraction in the kitchen with the jug boiling and the cat who stares like Miri owes it money on the windowsill to remind us it knows the window, the cuff made a little bird noise and I laughed so hard I had to sit down. It was ridiculous. It was practical. It was ours.\n\n\u201cYou are not a storm,\u201d she said that night when the ferry made its odd pattern again and we counted without meaning to. \u201cStop calling yourself weather. You\u2019re a man. Who does a thing. Sometimes. With rules. And carrots.\u201d She tapped the tin with the earplugs. \u201cWe are making rules. We are buying vegetables. We are not having an apocalypse.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall apocalypses,\u201d I said, because I couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cOne-room apocalypses. The kind you can clean up with a damp cloth.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d she said, fond and bossy, and I did, and for the first time since the hiss arrived at my particular shoreline I slept like a person who had chosen his own bed.\n\nIn the morning a letter was waiting that had a Te Papa stamp in the corner, which made me suspect Graeme had enemies he hadn\u2019t told me about. It wasn\u2019t that. It was from a conservator there I half-knew from the meetings where small museums learn how to be more boring safely. She wrote like a woman who edits herself, everything neat. She had heard \u201cthrough channels\u201d that our emergency lights were unreliable and that we had \u201cmanaged admirably\u201d (her phrase; I looked twice) in the dark. If we needed to borrow battery lanterns in the interim, she had a cupboard full and a soft spot for people who had to work near anchors. At the bottom she had added a line in a different pen. Do you ever get that high note? I do. Thought I was mad. Not a trick question. No rush.\n\nI put the letter under the long white cloud magnet because that is what we do with omen mail now, and I stood very still in the kitchen while the jug clicked off by itself. Miri came in with clay on her shin in the shape of a crescent and read the fine print without me offering. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, which is our family\u2019s favourite word for a door. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\nWe had thought we were the only people in Wellington listening to a fence in the sky. We might not be. I put my finger on the strip of different ink and tapped twice like the inside of my skull when the lights go out. The house made that small pop houses make when they\u2019ve decided not to fall down for another day. The wind found the bathroom vent and sang there for a second because it refuses to be left out. I breathed the way a person breathes when his world has just widened by an inch and the inch is a thousand kilometres long. I wasn\u2019t ready to answer her. But I folded the letter neat and put it in my pocket with the chain because belonging, it turns out, comes in absurd forms.\n\nThe day after that the sea threw back at us a container the colour of a bruise, and I watched three men in a truck try to argue the laws of hydrodynamics into letting them fetch it and lost my way to the right floor cleaner because all the physics in my life were suddenly in the same room. The anchor hummed at me twice without reason. A kid pressed both her palms to the glass and said hello. I cupped my ear. The hiss behaved. I didn\u2019t go. I didn\u2019t vanish. I stayed. It was, after all, a weekday. People expect certain things. I wrote a reply to the conservator on paper because that seemed right. I wrote maybe and then crossed it out and wrote yes and folded it too small. I posted it in the box on the corner that never quite swallows letters on the first try, and went back to the museum and my mop and my anchor and the building\u2019s breath, and every time the ferry blew its horn in that pattern we were learning I breathed and counted and didn\u2019t call it a sign in case it heard me and decided to have opinions.",

                              "content": "Kiri wrote back before the letter could get used to being in my pocket. It was a card with a woodcut of a shag on weathered paper, the sort of thing that looks humble and costs triple. Her handwriting was the same tidy channel she\u2019d used before, light pressure like she didn\u2019t want to bruise the paper. Yes, she wrote. Yes to the note, yes to thinking you\u2019re mad, yes to the way rooms behave like complicated instruments. She suggested coffee at the museum caf\u00e9 at ten on Thursday, the one with the muffins that disintegrate and the barista who looks like he\u2019s forgiven nobody for ordering decaf. \u201cIf you want the lanterns, I\u2019ll bring the key. If you want to talk about the sound, we can sit and pretend to be discussing loan agreements,\u201d she wrote, and added under that, small, \u201cI\u2019d appreciate not being mad on my own.\u201d\n\nMiri read it with her chin on my shoulder and a smear of blue on her forearm from a glaze she was pretending not to like. \u201cShe\u2019s careful,\u201d she said, pleased in the way you\u2019re pleased when someone else knows how to walk on thin ice without pointing at it. \u201cWe like careful. Don\u2019t go alone. I\u2019ll pretend to be interested in a dinosaur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong museum,\u201d I said, and she flicked my ear with the corner of the card because she refuses to be corrected by me even when I\u2019m right.\n\nWe walked down on the morning she\u2019d named, wind in its better mood and the sky doing that pale, hard blue it saves for days it thinks it can get away with. I wore the clay cuff, the little whistles drilled by Miri to make my hand susceptible to embarrassment. The chain lived in my pocket with a spare earplug and a stick of gum that had seen better centuries. Miri had tied her scarf in a way that made strangers think she was a person inspectors might ask for a permit. At the threshold of the big museum I felt both loyal and adulterous. Our little place near the port had its anchor and its breath. This big place had its own plans and its own giants.\n\nKiri was the easier kind of precise. She sat at the edge of the caf\u00e9 like she wanted to be near the door but not look like she wanted to be near the door, glasses on a chain that made its own tiny clink against a ceramic cup. She wore a cardigan that had been patched by someone who liked to patch. When she looked up and saw us, her face did not do surprise. It did recognition like we were coming back from a longer walk than she had expected us to take. \u201cEli,\u201d she said, and then, to Miri, \u201cAnd you\u2019ve brought backup, which is very sensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my sister Miri,\u201d I said, not explaining the steps of the staircase that made that true. \u201cShe\u2019s the kind of person who carries spare earplugs and snacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get on,\u201d Kiri said, as if she collected such people. She pushed a plate of muffins our way like an offering that did not commit her to anything. Up close, the carefulness in her moved like a person who doesn\u2019t want to knock a table full of borrowed things. Her voice was low, unadvertised. \u201cBefore we do the closet full of lights and health and safety, can we talk about the note without any of us staring directly at it?\u201d\n\nWe talked around it like a fire we were all slightly superstitious of. She called it a line in her head, not loud, not constant, coaxed by quiet rooms and that particular dead air that happens before rain. It was higher at night and lower by big cold machines. When she had to sit in the textiles room with the humidifiers sulking, it wove itself underneath the whine like a thread. \u201cIn the print store it\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, as if she were apologising to a friend. \u201cPaper has good manners. In the stone store\u2026 it loves stone. The columns under here, the piles in the sea, whatever all of this sits on. It\u2019s as if the line stands up straight when it feels weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeight helps,\u201d I said, my thumb worrying the edge of the silly clay cuff as if it were a rosary. \u201cI have a piece of chain that keeps me in my chair. I sound like a dog. But\u2014weight. And rooms. And earplugs.\u201d\n\nMiri watched us with that tilted attention that made people confess things they hadn\u2019t meant to say out loud. \u201cWe think of it like feedback,\u201d she offered. \u201cLike Nana\u2019s hearing aids used to do at church. His squeal is the bad bit. The line is the bit he can be friends with, if the room lets it be a line and not a knife. The anchor helps. Clay helps. Metal helps. The front hall doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKiri nodded. \u201cCavities and edges,\u201d she said, relieved to have a phrase that made sense to her mouth. \u201cAnd yes to feedback. My grandfather\u2019s radio used to do it. He\u2019d put his hand on the cabinet, like he could pet the noise, and it would behave. When I walk past the air-handling units upstairs I can feel what it\u2019s going to be before it is. It makes me think I\u2019ve got a dog nose, which would be funny if it didn\u2019t keep me up at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it\u2014\u201d I started, and then stopped because the word I had about myself was not the right word to hand to someone else. \u201cDoes it do anything to your\u2026 being there. Does it pull at you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t\u2026 untie me,\u201d she said, picking her words like fruit she meant to put back if it bruised. \u201cNot the way you\u2019re hinting at. It pulls my attention until I can\u2019t hear anyone talking. It makes me stand with my hand on a pillar like a sad person who has married a building. The really bad days it feels like my head is made of glass and you can see the line running through it and the line will crack me if I breathe wrong. I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d she glanced around the caf\u00e9 with a quick apology because she was about to say a thing her place didn\u2019t like \u201c\u2014I don\u2019t vanish, Eli. But I can imagine how someone could if the line were their line more than mine.\u201d\n\nI did the stupid little sigh I do when somebody says something I have been pretending is mine alone. It isn\u2019t relief. Relief is simpler. This was kinship and the fear kinship brings. It tied my chest in a better knot. \u201cI can make my hand go,\u201d I said, as small as I could make the confession and still have it fit in a sentence. \u201cSometimes more. It\u2019s not right. But I can. And it squeals in the room unless I wear these or make the room friendly.\u201d\n\nKiri didn\u2019t move her face much. She didn\u2019t need to. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, the way a seam takes a stitch. \u201cWhen I read your letter I thought, if it\u2019s just me with the note, I can make friends with it. If it\u2019s not just me, then either I\u2019m not mad or we both are, and either of those outcomes is a relief. Lanterns?\u201d\n\nWe let the conversation sit in its own warmth while she fetched the key and the look that let her walk through doors people keep shut. We followed her down a corridor that smelled of dust that had agreed to be dust for a hundred years and up a service lift that hummed the way all lifts hum as if persuading themselves they are going up. The back-of-house here is a geometry of doors and signs that tell you not to do things you weren\u2019t going to do. Kiri unlocked a steel cabinet with a placard about charging and the dangerous romance of batteries, and we carried out lanterns that pretended to be mild until you made them behave. While we were there, surrounded by racks of blank-faced crates and dollies that wanted to be useful, she let us listen to the hum.\n\nIt was not our hum. It was the hum of a large organism that has to pretend to be a building. The floor under us had opinions. The piles in the harbour had their own song. The climate plant throbbed like a accountability. Kiri put her palm against a concrete column as if greeting a friend she owed money to. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, not looking ridiculous at all, because if anyone has the right to pet a building it is the person keeping everything in it from crumbling, \u201cis a good one.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t go there. Not because I didn\u2019t want to. Because everything in me that had learned manners told me not to touch the thing that held up this room with a trick I only partly owned. I breathed anyway because a man cannot help breathing, and the note in my head reached for the column without the rest of me giving it permission. There was no squeal. There was a rounding, like a wave that had found a different beach. The cuff on my wrist made a small sound, a bird gargle, and Miri flicked her eyes at it and then at me, a question and an answer in one blink.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d I said, cheap as a liar, and Kiri held up her hand like she was reminding a child that adults can hear lying.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, not fussy at all. \u201cNot because I don\u2019t want to see your fun party trick. Because this is a place where if you faint we have to fill in a digital form.\u201d\n\nWe took the lanterns like people who had borrowed eggs from a neighbor and promised to send back a cake. Kiri walked us back to the public part the long way so I could see the places the sound liked and didn\u2019t. Over the loading dock, where the sea talks in tyres and ropes, it was lower, not kinder exactly, but busy with other business. In the top corridor with the little windows where school groups line up to enter the earthquake thing I refuse to name, it was sharp and uncooperative. We made faces at it. \u201cI wear ear defenders in here when I\u2019m just moving through,\u201d Kiri said, demonstrating with a pair that folded out of her cardigan like a magician\u2019s prop. \u201cYoung lungs. Their frequencies. I hate saying it because it makes me a terrible person, but children are loud in ways my brain hates.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to hate it and still be fine,\u201d Miri said, which is the sort of sentence she keeps for people who deserve it.\n\nAt the caf\u00e9 door Kiri gave me a piece of paper folded in four because she doesn\u2019t trust email for things that matter. It was a sketch of rooms with notes beside them, a map of weather inside a building drawn by someone who has spent years watching temperature and relative humidity think. \u201cIf you get into trouble when you\u2019re here,\u201d she said, and her hand hovered, then settled on the wood as if signing the building\u2019s arm, \u201cgo to the exhibition hall opposite the textile lab. The cabinets are glass. Glass hates your note. It will spit you back like a child with medicine. You\u2019ll hate it too. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll know it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nOn the way out we passed a school group in their yellow vests and a teacher doing the voice about using inside voices in a building. One kid looked at us and stuck an earplug in his ear that wasn\u2019t there and winked. I couldn\u2019t tell if he belonged to this little cult of the note or if he was just being an obedient mimic. Outside, the wind decided to be cruel to kites again. Miri squeezed my wrist, her thumb finding the edge of the cuff like someone checking a seal, and said, \u201cWe\u2019re getting a club together whether you like it or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t start a club,\u201d I said, and then immediately wanted to start a club, a small one that met in quiet rooms and drank tea and told the truth about the way buildings breathe.\n\nBack home, I tried to write down everything I thought I had learned about the line and the rooms and what Kiri had said, but language went slippery and my words made fools of themselves on the page. I put the paper under the long white cloud magnet and drew a picture of the anchor instead, which soothed me in a way that made me embarrassed for thirty seconds until it didn\u2019t. Miri put the lanterns on the rimu table without a cloth because she wasn\u2019t worried about scratches and made labels that said BORROWED in her neat capitals, because she is the kind of person who will make sure we give things back with a thank you card even when we got them by official channels.\n\nWe took one of the lanterns down to our museum that evening not because we\u2019d lose power again but because sometimes light that isn\u2019t from the walls is good company. The building did its after-hours breathe that makes me think of animals putting their noses under their tails. I put the lantern on the desk where Graeme pretends to have modern thoughts and let it make its own circle. The anchor did its hum like it had a conversation to continue. The cuff was warm against my wrist; the chain in my pocket was the weight of a favour you\u2019ve agreed to do before you know what it is.\n\n\u201cYou going to tell Graeme about your new friend?\u201d Miri asked, palming the lantern\u2019s handle like she\u2019d design a better one if the world would let her spoil the fun of it.\n\n\u201cIf I say Te Papa he will do that thing where he pretends we\u2019re not a museum but a historical failure to be a supermarket,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell him about the lights. He loves lights now. He dreams of incident reports. He\u2019s going to start writing them for his breakfast.\u201d\n\nShe laughed quietly, and the laugh ran round the room and came back softer, the way people are kinder to your jokes when they like the place you\u2019ve made them in. For a while we just sat. That was a skill we didn\u2019t have to learn. When I breathed and let the line find the anchor again without going anywhere, I felt it answer more quickly, as if cordiality had been established. The hiss rounded with the chain\u2019s help. The cuff made no noise. Outside the ferry made its pattern we were pretending not to be reading and Miri didn\u2019t count but did move her fingers against her knee in that way she does when numbers are better than words.\n\n\u201cNews from Jace,\u201d she said, because she knows not to let silence get fancy. \u201cHe got a tattoo he says is a tribute to his derailleur and also to you. It\u2019s a circle with a notch you can\u2019t see unless he flexes, which he made me do my best to avoid. He says he understands your line now, philosophically, which is to say he understands absolutely nothing but believes he does, and in men that\u2019s almost as useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll thank him for thinking of me while flexing,\u201d I said, and made a mental note to buy him fries, the only currency he accepts for good intentions.\n\nWe were closing early because the storm had rearranged everyone\u2019s appetite for maritime heritage, and I was sweeping the life buoys room which always makes me feel judged for reasons I can\u2019t explain when the woman with the sunhat walked in without her sunhat and with a pear in her hand. She saw me and did a very brave thing: she didn\u2019t turn away this time. She came and stood near the anchor like it was a person we had both come to talk to. \u201cI posted a card,\u201d she began, as if she weren\u2019t sure whether the fact of it made it true. \u201cHe told me you got it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d I said, because truth is easy when it\u2019s small. \u201cThank you. I liked the bit about the pear.\u201d\n\nShe smiled with one side of her mouth because the other was shy. \u201cI decided to come back and not bring the hat to see if it helped. I did bring the pear again but I ate it on the way because the bus driver had opinions and I have low blood sugar when men have opinions. I\u2026 wanted to apologise again but also to say, if it happens again, I\u2019ll try not to make my face do the thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t promise it won\u2019t ever be ugly,\u201d I said, hating the way that sounded like a threat and wanting to make it into a promise and not knowing how. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it. The sound. We\u2019re making shapes for it so it doesn\u2019t stab the air. And\u2014thank you for coming back. That\u2019s not nothing.\u201d\n\nShe looked at the anchor the way people look at old dogs who will not do tricks. \u201cWhen I was little my mum\u2019s hearing aids would squeal and she\u2019d take them out and put them in her pocket and then whatever we were talking about would go away. It used to make me furious, like the sound had stolen my mother. It didn\u2019t, of course. She did what she could. But I\u2019ve been a bit cross with sound my whole life. Yours felt like\u2014\u201d she searched for it and found something that made her own face relax \u201c\u2014like a mistake nobody meant. I can forgive that.\u201d\n\nWe stood there in that small generosity like birds willing to eat from a hand that doesn\u2019t trust itself. She asked the anchor nothing in particular. The anchor returned the favour. When she left, she did it by saying \u201cbye\u201d to the room, which meant more to me than the letter, which is saying something because I have become an absolute tragic for the post.\n\nThat evening, at our table, Miri drilled two more holes in the clay of a mug where the handle met the body and blew across it to make sure the note came and I told her about the pear woman and she tipped imaginary beer for the brave. We had lantern light on for the sake of it while our actual working lights did their duty, which is the kind of decadent we can afford. I tried again to write properly to Kiri, to tell her what the anchor felt like and what the wind did to the ferry horns and how the bus was a danger to my elbow, but the pen took over and I wrote instead about the column and the way concrete has this big slow kindness and posted it before I could burn it. When I came back in Miri was holding the cuff and talking to it like it was a small animal that had done something both dear and stupid and I had to sit down because the day had grown a shape that fit me and the fit was a relief I didn\u2019t trust.\n\nWe started meeting Kiri in unimportant corners once a week, lending things and returning them, passing the hard sentences we couldn\u2019t bear to say to anyone else. She had two colleagues she thought might hear when she did but wasn\u2019t sure whether to risk it, and she told us once about a time in the art store when the frames all creaked together like a chorus line and she\u2019d had to sit on the floor and pretend her laces were misbehaving. She showed us how to stand in a doorway if we thought the knife wanted out, the angle that made the sound find the edge of itself and trip, which is either physics or faith. We traded maps of rooms like kids who liked different trees. We learnt the smell of battery plastic. We got very good at apologising to inanimate objects when we used them as if they were animate, which is to say we talked to the marlin and to concrete and to little orange cones and to mugs that learned to sing.\n\nA letter arrived from Nana\u2019s old retirement village, not because the universe has no subtlety but because lives have paperwork and we had forgotten some of it. A nurse wrote in a tidy, cheerful hand that they were clearing out their store of lost-and-not-claimed and had found a set of hearing aids we might want for sentimental purposes, which is a sentence that could make anyone cry and then laugh and then want to throw a chair. We went to fetch them because there is no world in which we wouldn\u2019t at least go and see. The woman behind the counter was efficient with a pen and gentle with her voice and slid a small box across to us like a thing that could break time if you dropped it.\n\nThey were not Nana\u2019s; that was obvious the second Miri opened the lid. They were too modern, the sort that live in your ear invisibly and make you think you can hear the weather decide. Miri touched them with one finger and then drew her finger back because nobody knew what anyone had promised these tiny machines. \u201cWe should give them to someone who\u2019ll use them,\u201d she said, which sounded like sense and also like a door. We took them home anyway because we are magpies and put them in the same drawer as the chain when it is sleeping and the tin of earplugs and the letter from Kiri and the postcard with pear on it and acknowledged that our junk drawer had become a very particular kind of reliquary.\n\nThat night I took one of the little hearing aids out and put it in my palm and you know how sometimes objects tell you their pasts with a smell or a colour. This one didn\u2019t. It sat and pretended to be neutral. I put it in, because not to would have been cowardly in a way that didn\u2019t keep anybody safe, and immediately the world sharpened itself\u2014the crisp on the edge of the fridge, the damp in the window frame, Miri humming under her breath which she always does when she stirs something to trick it into not catching. The hiss in my head did something else. It made room for the hearing aid. It coiled back a fraction, then found a different rail and ran along it. There was no knife. There was no blessed silence. There was adjustment, which is more honest than either.\n\nMiri looked up and registered the face I make when I\u2019m trying not to look like my head is a concert hall. \u201cBad?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d I said, and waited for my own protest. \u201cDifferent. Like\u2014I\u2019ve put a mirror behind the bar. The bottles all look like there are more of them, and the room feels bigger, and none of the alcohol has increased. The line didn\u2019t go away. It moved its chair.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that going to make your hand worse,\u201d she asked, practical even through the soft. \u201cOr is that going to make you less annoying at the bus stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, which is a phrase that, spoken out loud at the right table, is actually a spell. \u201cI think I want to see what concrete does with this.\u201d\n\nWe tried it by the anchor like we do all things now because we are those people. With the hearing aid in, the chain around my wrist and the orange cones in the tin glaring up like little carrots waiting for soup, I let the line find the anchor hum and it was as if two musicians who had been playing next to each other without acknowledging each other finally looked up and nodded. The knife stayed away. The building\u2019s breath came through the small machine like a polite visitor. The cuff didn\u2019t twitter. The cleaning light above the life buoys didn\u2019t flicker. I did not go. I stayed. I counted to six, to seven, to eight, to the ferry, which surprised me by not sounding just then. When I took the little machine out the world sighed out of its sharpness and back into its familiar, and I wanted to write a thank you card to a factory somewhere and did not know how to address it.\n\nWe did not keep the hearing aids. We took them back to the village with a note that said thank you and also, if nobody claims them in a month, please see if they can go to the clinic down the road that does the cheap fittings for people who find the world blurrier than they can afford. And then we went to the National Library again to annoy the guard because we are unteachable and stood in the atrium and did nothing and thought how nice it is sometimes to have a day that does nothing to you.\n\nOn Saturday, Jace played a set in a place that never has enough chairs and Miri and I wore our plugs and stood near the back because that is our idea of romance. He had the new tattoo, stupid and good, and afterwards he put his sweaty arm around my shoulders and said quietly, \u201cI\u2019ve named your chain Nigel,\u201d which is the sort of thing that can save a person from drowning in their own ideas. On the walk home we crossed the road at the lights like citizens and the wind took a holiday and the ferry blew once in a way that meant nothing and we chose to count it anyway because structure is a gift we can give ourselves.\n\nThe next morning the sea broke an old bottle on the rocks and set it to singing in a way only we could hear and we didn\u2019t tell anyone because some things are for two or three people in a room with a thermos and a list of rooms that behave. Later that day a man from the council came and put up a sign by the loading dock about not feeding gulls, and the gulls observed him like gods. That night I dreamt that the city slid a key into me and turned it and a door I hadn\u2019t known was mine opened on air. When I woke, the hiss was a line and the line was a thing I could point to and not be owned by, and Miri was asleep with one orange plug half in, ridiculous, and the chain swung on the hook by the door the smallest amount as if a truck had gone by far away, and I went to work and put my hand on the anchor case and said, \u201cKia ora,\u201d to a piece of metal that had never asked to be greeted and was the kind of company that makes the rest possible.",

I had dusted the case already and was not dusting it again; I was standing there like a man who\u2019d forgotten what he\u2019d come into a room for and had decided to make his forgetting look deliberate. The hiss had tucked itself into the corner of my head like a cat that was pretending it didn\u2019t want attention. Graeme did his shuffle behind me that announces a visitor who will both be important and need to be placated. He has a shuffle for bored tourists, a shuffle for school groups, and this was his polite panic shuffle, the one he used for men in suits with clipboards who can adjust budgets by coughing.\n\n\u201cEli,\u201d he said, and it became an introduction. \u201cThis is Rory from Council. Heritage. He\u2019s here to do an audit. Routine. Entirely routine. He is not here to remove anything or to suggest anything be removed.\u201d\n\nRory shook my hand like he\u2019d been taught to shake hands during a module called Community Engagement. He was younger than me and older than the way he spoke. His hair had a part in it that looked drawn with a ruler. His clipboard had the frog-stare of a thing that would not blink first. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a sweep,\u201d he said, and smiled like that was friendly. \u201cJust making sure your documentation is up to date for the anchor and associated items.\u201d\n\n\u201cDocumentation,\u201d said Graeme in a tone that is usually followed by the delicate sound of paper having a nervous breakdown. \u201cYes. Well. Of course. Associated items include everything in this room in a philosophical sense.\u201d\n\nRory didn\u2019t laugh because he had trained himself not to, even when things were funny. He walked to the anchor and stood contemplating it with the new way city people look at old things: anxious in case they are meant to be moved, anxious in case they are meant to be worshipped. \u201cThere\u2019s a proposal,\u201d he said lightly, too lightly, not looking at me, \u201cto gather some of the historically significant maritime pieces from the smaller spaces to\u2014 well, to consolidate. For care. And access.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsolidate,\u201d repeated Graeme, the way you repeat a diagnosis you disagree with. \u201cTe Papa doesn\u2019t want our anchor. It would be like bringing a stray dog to a man with a lion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about what they want,\u201d said Rory, and then saw me seeing him and adjusted. \u201cIt\u2019s about a coordinated story. Our waterfront narrative is fragmented. We\u2019re seeking cohesion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can hold your cohesion while you get your coat,\u201d I said before my mouth checked with my better angels. \u201cThe anchor\u2019s part of the story by being here, where people come in by mistake and leave on purpose.\u201d\n\nRory wrote something that was probably not what I had said. He opened his mouth to be nice to me and Miri walked in. She never comes in on audit days on purpose, but she has a nose for the sort of person who says consolidate in a voice like a dentist with a brochure. She had clay on her wrist like a bracelet nobody sells. She clocked him, clocked the clipboard, stood beside me and put her hand flat on the glass as if to demonstrate how very much the anchor was staying. \u201cKia ora,\u201d she said pleasantly. \u201cYou here to tell us a story about consolidation, or you here to hear one?\u201d\n\nHe blinked because her version of polite is the sort that slides under armour without tearing it. He asked a few more questions about accession numbers and the acid-free paper we didn\u2019t have; Graeme made noises like a man sacrificing himself to a god of forms. When Rory left he shook my hand too properly again and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d which in Wellington either means never or means the exact opposite. The hiss in my head had raised its head enough to let me feel the edge of it. The anchor did its single quiet thrum and I beat back a ridiculous urge to ask it whether it wanted to leave like a person with a dog who says \u201cWalk?\u201d to a creature who will always answer yes and mean you.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll take it if we don\u2019t chain ourselves to it,\u201d said Graeme, once the door had closed, and then realised what he had said and looked at my wrist as if the clay band were an omen. \u201cI mean\u2014 they\u2019ll request to rehouse it. We will\u2026 advocate.\u201d He said the word like he was studying it in a field guide. \u201cWe will be devastated in a manner that appears rational on paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould they really shift it?\u201d I asked, because I needed to throw my dread against a wall to see whether it bounced.\n\n\u201cIf a crane can lift it and a committee can nod at it, then yes,\u201d said Miri, who has made a map in her head of how money moves heavy things. \u201cHush. We\u2019re not fighting ghosts. We\u2019ll make noise if we have to. Community consultation is a thing. So is being here at the right time with the right people making the right fuss.\u201d\n\nWe could make fuss, yes; we were practitioners. But there is fuss and there is noise, and the latter is the enemy of the line. I spent the rest of the morning being good, by which I mean making myself small in the public rooms and large in the cupboards where the supplies keep their own weird order. The hiss stayed reasonable. The chain in my pocket knocked its small household noise. The clay cuff sat easy. I sent Kiri a message that said, in the code we were learning, Council man. Consolidate. Anchor at risk of being curated elsewhere. She sent back one word: Lunch? and an arrow that pointed downwards, which is to say the piles.\n\nWe met her at the freight lift like we had the first time, a conspiratorial miracle of bad lighting and polite ignoration by anyone who might have stopped us. The undercroft is not for the public because the public deserves better than to know how their gods stand up. It smells of salt that has been made to behave and concrete that surrendered to water a long time ago and now makes a religion of standing perfectly still. Kiri walked us between columns like a woman walking with trees she liked and did not need to name. \u201cBefore we start being sensible,\u201d she said, as if we ever had, \u201ctell me what Council said.\u201d\n\nWe told her, and she made a face that would not play on television. \u201cOf course they want a single story,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course they do. It\u2019s tidier. But they have never met the sea properly if they think it will hold still for their brochure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill we have to give it up?\u201d I asked, the way a child asks whether his house can be taken because he is poor and people with suits like to bother poor people. Kiri put a hand on a column and breathed in the way I recognise now because it\u2019s my habit too.\n\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes the trick isn\u2019t shouting. It\u2019s showing your messy little room is actually holding a note the big rooms can\u2019t. No one likes to admit their big stories can\u2019t be sung without a small place humming the line.\u201d She cut her eyes at me. \u201cShow me, but not too much. The piles are ruthless; they\u2019ll keep you if you put your foot wrong.\u201d\n\nI put my earplug in one side and the chain across my palm and counted like I was sneaking across a sleeping dog. The column\u2019s note was so steady it made my teeth want to relax. I made myself not be ambitious. Left hand only, to the wrist, the cuff holding me within the embarrassment range. The hiss didn\u2019t sharpen here; it deepened, a violin moving nearer to being a cello by standing close to one. There was no knife. The hearing aid, the cheap one we\u2019d borrowed and returned already in theory, wasn\u2019t in, and I missed it for half a second and then not at all. The air changed around the place where I wasn\u2019t and the column accepted that as if its job included hosting idiocy. The weight under us made manners of my nerves. Above our heads people did their museum. Down here the building did its patience.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Kiri, and her voice sounded better than mine in this room because it had learnt to be low. \u201cGlass will spit you and stone won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s our rule for now. Remember it when your hand gets ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hand is all idea,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s my ambition I don\u2019t trust.\u201d\n\nWe came up with a plan that was not a plan so much as a promise to pay attention in public: if Council pushed, we would bring the people who visited because they wandered and stayed because a heavy thing greeted them and we would make our case in a room that liked us. Kiri would talk to the two colleagues she thought might hear as we do, sound out (the phrase is irritatingly exact) their lines. She would find the pages in our messy accession records that proved the anchor belonged to the room as much as it belonged to paper. \u201cWe will be very nice to the person with the stamp,\u201d she said gravely. \u201cWe will practise quiet and then noise in the right order.\u201d\n\nIn the days after, the weather did a handshake with us: calm enough to feel chosen, unsettled enough to keep from smugness. Miri\u2019s mugs, the ones with their small whistle holes shaped like decisions, got famous in a way she didn\u2019t plan and then had to behave as if she had. A friend of a friend took a photo of someone blowing across a handle and making a noise like a soft kettle and put it on a thing and the thing did what things do. Orders. People asked stupid questions about whether the mugs were haunted on purpose. A man wanted to know if her cups had Bluetooth. A woman sent a long email about the ethics of vessels that make sound for people who are not sound-typical and I watched Miri write back three drafts before she chose the one that said, in her pretty handwriting, I am not selling you a therapy. I am selling you a cup you can coax if you like.\n\nThe only bit of success that wasn\u2019t paper was the kiln. The kiln had its own line and I had never noticed because why would I, it had never wanted me before. In the second firing after the attention arrived, it found the hiss and made a friend of it, the dangerous way some friends make everything into a game with a knife. The small squeal started not in the air but in the wall, and Miri went pale and steady the way she goes when she\u2019s about to do a sensible thing and hates that that\u2019s her job. We\u2019d already made a rule about earplugs in the kitchen when the kiln is sulking; we made another about not being in the same room as it without at least being prepared to count.\n\n\u201cJust stand there,\u201d she said, already cross with herself for asking, \u201cand tell it not to be grand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to negotiate with a box of fire,\u201d I said, which is precisely the sort of sentence I had not expected to say sincerely in my thirties.\n\n\u201cYou want to rescue anchors,\u201d she said, and we looked at each other with the standard amount of care. I stood in the doorway because Kiri had taught us the trick of doors, chain doing its small duty against my vein. The squeal was inching up to glass-knife territory, the kind that goes right under your nail and takes your patience with it. I did the Nana hand over ear because it had become my superstition and breathed the kiln into a different room in my head. The line in me curved downwards, asking the box to take that note instead of the other. It did not like being told. Neither do I. We compromised like badly-mannered neighbours: we agreed on a pitch that didn\u2019t make my eyes water. The little bird noises in my cuff were ridiculous and helpful. Miri\u2014who had never coddled me when I was being dramatic and wasn\u2019t about to start\u2014gave me a nod like a pilot giving a plane leave to land. After, she slid a cup of water across the bench in that way she has of detaching tenderness from making a scene.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not firing with you in the house again unless we make a hymn book,\u201d she said, blowing out her cheeks. \u201cAnd if I get a migraine, I\u2019m sending it to you in an envelope.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease send me all your headaches,\u201d I said. \u201cI collect them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not that important,\u201d she said, and put her hand on my shoulder like I am.\n\nWord got around in the way word gets around in cities that like to think of themselves as villages and in villages that want credit for their cosmopolitan kinks. A teenage boy came in with his mother and stood by the bird wall and didn\u2019t look at me and did that thing kids do where they pretend they can copy a trick by deciding to be the sort of person who can do it. He held his breath and went purple and I went over not because I\u2019m a policeman but because purple is not a good colour on anyone. \u201cMate,\u201d I said, conspiratorially. \u201cThat\u2019s not how the tricks work. The trick is to put your lungs down. Not to squeeze them like lemons.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me sidelong because being seen is distasteful when you are fifteen and fond of yourself. He let go of his held breath in a dramatic exhale that would have embarrassed movie stars and scuffed his shoe. His mother did that grateful smile women in public do when men have chosen not to make something worse. \u201cI heard,\u201d she began, and I did the face that says please stop hearing, and she did stop, to my surprise. \u201cRight. Not for kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot for anyone without a manual,\u201d I said, and that didn\u2019t satisfy her, but we\u2019d both behaved how we wanted to about it, and that was enough.\n\nKiri invited us to a room we had not got onto our map yet, a generosity I knew she didn\u2019t extend lightly. Te Papa has spaces that are legends even to people who work there. The old cable-car winding house near the top of the hill is one; it holds a smell like old bread and hot metal. The plant room at the back where the water comes in is another. This room was a store for stone carvings, a quiet square with too much air, racks like pews, blankets that had learned humility. It was not just stone; it was stone that had been asked to be more than stone and had said yes at a chisel. Kiri, whose face is careful and whose hands are not, put her palm against an old lintel with a pattern worn by fingers and time and said, \u201cHere,\u201d like she was offering us a glass of water.\n\nI had both earplugs halfway in because I am a coward with a complicated job. I took one out to hear the room and not just my own orchestra and counted to see if the hiss wanted to be helpful or if it had decided to be an arse. It was good in here. The weight was kind. The little birds at my wrist kept their beaks shut. Miri didn\u2019t speak. Kiri did talk, softly, about care and whether care means preventing or listening. She asked me whether the stone sounded anything like the anchor. I told her that the anchor was monocular in its goodness; it looked in one direction with a steady regard. The stone had facets. The stone wanted you to move slightly until you found its patience. The anchor had sworn a thing and would not be moved from it. The stone had sworn a different thing and expected you to know how to stand near it.\n\n\u201cI can manage facets,\u201d said Kiri, and she put her ear to the lintel in a way that was both foolish and brave. \u201cDon\u2019t do the big party trick,\u201d she added, without looking up. \u201cRespectfully, this room does not want to see you go absent. You can hear that, yeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and felt relieved to have the instruction given as if we were all capable of mercy.\n\nWe left with our manners intact and the room unalarmed, which is not nothing. On the way out, by the loading dock, Kiri touched my arm in the place where my hand sometimes forgets me. \u201cIf they try to take your anchor,\u201d she said, voice low as a storage vault, \u201cwe will put a crowd where crowds count. And if they do take it, we will ask to curate the absence. Which, frankly, is your area.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not making a memorial to the anchor while the anchor is still alive,\u201d I said, and winced at myself for sounding like an auntie talking about her third husband.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making a plan B,\u201d she said, because she knows about institutions and how they never choose to be kind; they have to be cornered into it.\n\nThere was a southerly predicted the way Wellington predicts things: cheerfully, then apologetically, then with concern and a diagram. In the morning, before it arrived, the harbour had that flatness you get before someone slaps it. The weather app on my phone had decided to be poetic and said squalls, which is a word our town gives to meanness. By eleven, the sky came down like it was trying to be on the level with us. By eleven-fifteen, the rain arrived sideways with twenty cousins and an attitude problem. Graeme came out from behind his desk as if his rank included rowing. \u201cShutters,\u201d he said, which is the closest thing he has to a battle cry. \u201cWe never use them. We will today.\u201d\n\nThe shutters are a set of metal tongues that drop from above the door when the weather remembers who made this city, and they had not been asked to do their duty in longer than anyone could guarantee with paperwork. Two were obedient, if sulky. The third was a bastard. It had jammed itself three quarters down and thought that was a statement we should admire. Water began to make a plan at floor level, a thin bright certainty. Outside, the square looked like a ship deck. Inside, the museum began to feel like a box you pack in a hurry.\n\n\u201cToolbox,\u201d said Graeme, hurrying in that dignified way he reserves for disasters and weddings. He passed me the thing. I found the sort of spanner that has ideas above its station. I put my hands where hands go when there\u2019s a problem with a system that has not been asked to prove itself since 2007. The hiss tried to be clever and I told it not now. The chain nudged my wrist, an old friend clearing its throat. The clay cuff didn\u2019t sing until I got my fingers too near the part where the shutter\u2019s tongue hid behind metal pretending to be a wall. It made one small alarm noise like a trapped bird and I stopped because I had taught myself to stop when equipment pretended to be alive.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d said Miri behind me, not unkindly. She had the bucket because even on days like this she insists on the appropriate theatre props. \u201cWe will not have you taking risks with your stupid gift and my good broom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d I said, and then I put my hand into the cavity anyway because the other option was to let the shutter do its impression of a choice. The gap was narrow; this was the point. My knuckles scuffed metal. I let the line take my fingers only, a polite retreat from skin, slipped across the sneer of a bracket that had corroded itself into a position and didn\u2019t want to be coaxed. The squeal tried to climb up the metal; I cupped my ear like a man thinking hard and pushed the knife back into a shape the room could digest. I found the catch, it was a child of a catch, not meant to be the problem it had become. I pressed it with invisible digits, felt the give, felt the old grease try to swallow my pride and my half-hand together. I breathed for two slow ticks of the metronome that was not here and yet was, and the shutter took the hint and slid the last two hands-worth like the end of a thought you can finally remember. Water hit it with the authority of a government department. We stepped back into the middle of the room and watched the river bargain with the door and lose.\n\n\u201cNo incident,\u201d said Graeme, which is what he says when there has been one but he would like us to behave as if there hasn\u2019t. He looked at me with that specific horror administrators get when their staff have done a thing that makes stories. \u201cThank you,\u201d he added, and he meant it, which cost him some paperwork in heaven.\n\n\u201cWrite it down as I applied manual assistance to a recalcitrant mechanism,\u201d I said, and he did, later, with only one adverb, which is how you know he was shaken.\n\nThe storm gave us the courtesy of not being longer than it needed to be. It slapped, it spat, it flounced off, it left behind its receipts: a car with a sense of shame two streets over, a bin lid in a place no bin had ever been, several gulls in a mood. The shutters dripped dignity. The anchor took none of it personally. The floor took it all personally and sulked until Miri told it off with a mop and a word that might be a spell. I put the spanner away in the wrong place because I am a saboteur and the man who knows where it is likes being useful.\n\nThat night it did the thing where it is, for a moment, so clear you suspect somebody washed the day. I rang Jace and told him the shutter story and he laughed and said, \u201cYour ghost fingers are getting the best overtime,\u201d and then made a plan to bring us chips, because his way of negotiating grief is grease. He turned up with a paper parcel and a knot of compliments and told me he\u2019d started a waiting list for people who wanted little chains to put in their pockets even though they didn\u2019t know why. \u201cNigel is breeding,\u201d he said, deadpan, and Miri glowered at him as if he were to blame for the existence of puns.\n\nWe were almost done with the chips when Kiri sent a message that was not like her. It didn\u2019t have any difficult words in it. It had three: At mine? Please. I looked at Miri. She\u2019d already got her coat. We went.\n\nKiri\u2019s house was exactly what I thought it would be: books shelved with a logic I do not share, careful cups, a plant that looked like it was flourishing out of sheer politeness. She met us at the door with no theatre in her face, which made a theatre in mine; I am a person who needs cues. \u201cIt\u2019s not an emergency,\u201d she said, reading me rightly. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014 I had a\u2026 experience. And I would rather not file it by myself in the cabinet labelled \u2018Professionals Don\u2019t Do This\u2019.\u201d\n\nWe sat at her kitchen table because kitchens are the only stage where people say the things they mean to say. She wrapped her hands around a mug that probably had a provenance. She spoke very simply because that\u2019s how you do it when your mouth has had to work at being brave. In the stone room, after we left, she\u2019d gone back to log her activities in that way she has that means she sleeps at night. The note in her head had been misbehaving against her better judgement. The concrete in that room is different; it\u2019s trying too hard not to be the earth. She had stood in the doorway like a well-brought-up ghost and put her hand on the lintel again, just the casual touch you give to something expensive when you\u2019re pretending not to love it. She had felt\u2014not desire, she said, not that gross word\u2014permission. And her palm had gone cool in that way my gone hand goes. She had felt the shape of her own hand against the absence it made. She had pulled back at once because she had the enemy of all museum workers in her body\u2014the fear of breaking the thing\u2014and because she is sensible. Still. It had happened. The sound afterwards had been gentle. But it had been real.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t vanish. I didn\u2019t intend to. But the line\u2026 made a way for me,\u201d she said, and there was no drama in her voice, which is how you know you\u2019re in the company of the reliable kind of person who does frightening things. \u201cI have rules about not touching anything I cannot fix. I stood in my own kitchen later and put my hand on the wood and waited, because wood loves me and hates me in equal measure. Nothing. So I do not think I am becoming the kind of person you are. I also do not think you are the kind of person who is happening to me. I think the rooms are\u2026 teaching us.\u201d\n\nMiri leaned forwards like a counsellor who has thought of a metaphor I can afford. \u201cRooms as teachers,\u201d she said. \u201cRooms as hearing aids. Rooms as instruments. You don\u2019t get to pick the lesson, but you can choose your seat.\u201d\n\nKiri rubbed her forehead with a finger that had a patch of glue on it. \u201cMy boss would love to add \u2018avoiding becoming incorporeal\u2019 to our risk register, but I\u2019d rather not,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need some more rules. Rule one, as before: glass spits. Rule two: stone is kind but will keep you if you let it. Rule three: metal will sing for you but will not save you from stupidity. Rule four: if you\u2019re near electricity and you even think of going\u2014you will ring me and I will ring you and we will make sure you do not look like a fried novelty at the fair.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll write them properly and put them on the fridge,\u201d said Miri, because of course she would. \u201cAlso: earplugs in rooms that want to scream. Also: chain for pockets. Also: buddy. No tricks in alleys.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso,\u201d I said, because we were making a covenant and jokes come hand-in-hand with vows in our family, \u201cwe will start an unofficial official club.\u201d\n\nKiri made a face that contained surprise and relief and despair. \u201cWe absolutely will not,\u201d she said, and then, having said it, let the opposite be true. \u201cFine. It will need a stupid name. It cannot be \u2018The Line\u2019 because men will make t-shirts. \u2018Practising Quiet,\u2019\u201d she offered, almost shyly, which is her version of swagger. \u201cWe can call it that when we need to tidy it away from people who don\u2019t know how to hold fragile sentences.\u201d\n\nWe did not sign anything. We did not make a logo. Miri took a pen out of nowhere and began to write on the back of a flyer for a ceramic sale: our names, the rules, the rooms that like us, and a one-line description that read, in her print, Practising Quiet is a group of people who hear a sound that makes their bones behave and who won\u2019t be idiots about it. We all looked at her word idiots and nodded like church people at a hymn.\n\nOn the way home, the wind had chosen to arrange itself into little fists that smacked your ears when you weren\u2019t expecting it. The ferry did not blow; it was probably sulking in its berth and recounting its own courage to itself. The anchor at the museum would be drying behind its shutter, the chain thinking its slow thoughts. The kiln would be sleeping like a child that had tantrumed all afternoon. The city kept all its lights on because people need proof of their own continuance. In the alley by the garages, there was a new chalk X where a different child had placed a different treasure. We walked past it without the usual clutch, buoyant with the knowledge that our strange was not alone and also not infinite.\n\nThe next morning my mother rang, which she does once a month because she keeps a calendar for everything, including her guilt. She asked me if I was eating, which is code for I love you and also please don\u2019t make me be complicated. I told her about the storm because storms are safe to talk about; they\u2019re nobody\u2019s fault. She told me about the woman from her walking group who had broken her wrist on a kerb and about Gareth texting from Blenheim about an alpaca being born with a white spot in the shape of an earring. \u201cHe misses Miri,\u201d she said in that middle voice that tries not to fault anyone. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to say it like a person who has ever done feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us do,\u201d I said, and meant it in the forgiving way, which is new. \u201cTell him she\u2019s fine. Tell him she\u2019s building a small, unnecessary empire. Tell him I said she can\u2019t be adopted by alpacas because she\u2019s too short.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t tell my mother about Practising Quiet. I didn\u2019t tell her that my hand goes and comes like an unpunctual child. I didn\u2019t tell her that I love an anchor. I did tell her to bring pears if she came by, and she made a noise that meant the part of her that is a mother was satisfied by a practical instruction. After we hung up, I stood and watched the light behaving itself on the kitchen floorboards. The hiss was good. The chain touched the doorframe like a wind-chime behaving because the wind had decided to be polite. The tin with the orange cones sat on the table where we always leave it now and I opened it and counted them, because it turns out there are things in a life a person can count and feel less alone.\n\nCouncil did get in touch, three weeks later, because time in government is measured not in days but in the number of chairs a person has sat on and the number of signatures a thing has carried across town. They wanted to come and \u201cassess the feasibility\u201d of \u201ctemporary relocation during refurbishment.\u201d This is the sort of phrasing that means a thing wants to move and is asking you to bless it before it elopes. We made a day of it. We asked people with prams who had always come in out of the wind to write a sentence about the anchor in a book Miri found and labelled with a care that would shame archivists. We wrote down the names of the men who turned up on their lunch breaks to look at the thing that had met more water than them and sighed. We asked Rory to stand in the room during school arrival and watch what the anchor does to the noise level without moving a millimetre. Kiri came in on her day off and stood in the corner not being Te Papa and being the weight of Te Papa in a quiet way. We did not mention our club. We did not mention the way rooms either spit or hold. We did not mention the sound that sits in our bones like a low tide with a clock. We let the anchor do its job.\n\nAfter, Rory stood out front with his clipboard catching rain because the weather had chosen to perform aptness, and said to me, as if telling a person who does floors mattered, \u201cWe\u2019ll need to rethink the consolidation plan for this one. There\u2019s\u2026 site context. Also\u2014\u201d and here he made a face that was untrained \u201c\u2014people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can put that in a report,\u201d I said, and he did, because the new version of his clipboard had a place where you could tick the box that says intangible significance, which is our city\u2019s way of admitting that a heavy thing in the right room holds us together.\n\nThat night we didn\u2019t go to anyone\u2019s plant room. We didn\u2019t map any rooms. We didn\u2019t invent a new rule. We stood by the water in a wind that had stopped being furious and had started being merely opinionated and we ate chips with too much vinegar and the ferry blew once and then twice like it was correcting itself. The hiss stayed good. The anchor held. Kiri sent a message that only said \u0101e with a small dot like a blessing. Miri leaned her shoulder into mine like the younger sister she is and not the older one she sometimes has to be with me. We went home. I put my palm flat on the anchor case inside my head and said thank you to an absence I am learning to curate. We slept like people who have the right number of noises where they belong.",
